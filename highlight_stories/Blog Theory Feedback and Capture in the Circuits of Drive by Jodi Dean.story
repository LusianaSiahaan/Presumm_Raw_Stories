As  an  avowedly  engaged  and  political  approach  to  thought,  critical theory of any sort encounters challenges. Attempting  to analyze and intervene in the present, it nonetheless adopts  a backward gaze, an idea G.W.F. Hegel figures with the owl  of Minerva flying at dawn, Michel Foucault practices through  his  historical  methods  of  archaeology  and  genealogy,  and  Slavoj  Žižek  conceptualizes  with  the  notion  of  “retroactive  determination.” A problem specific to critical media theory is  the  turbulence  of  networked  communications:  that  is,  the  rapidity of innovation, adoption, adaptation, and obsolescence.1  The  object  of  one’s  theoretical  focus  and  critical  ire  quickly  changes  or  even  vanishes.  The  time  of  theory  is  over-taken,  even taken over, by ever-morphing, interlinking, media.2  Since books can easily be surpassed by events, they appear  particularly ill chosen as a medium through which to present  a critical media theory. A theory that is current, if it is possible  at  all,  seems  confined  to  presentation  within  the  forms  and  circuits it analyzes. It can be presented in face-to-face confer- ences, workshops, or meet-ups; it can be posted on discussion  lists or blogs. It can be visualized, videoed, shared and distrib- uted,  critiqued,  amended,  sampled,  and  forwarded.  Thought  can be made immediate, an element of its moment or, more  precisely,  of  the  fantasy  that  attempts  to  delimit  a  moment   out  of  the  present’s  rush  to  the  future  and  absorption  into   the past.  C2  1  DBG_01.indd   1  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   2  Blog	Settings  A book that makes critical-theoretical claims about blogging  thus encounters a double problem of its object and its form of  presentation.  Each  side  of  the  problem  entraps  theory  in  its  setting. To address its object in a timely fashion, the book has  to be new, fresh, up-to-the-minute, fashion-forward, bleeding- edge. It needs to predict or at least hazard a guess as to where  things are going, what’s going to happen. The book is pushed  to adopt, in other words, the entrepreneurial expectations of  the  venture  capitalist,  racing  to  be  the  first  out  of  the  block.  This side of the problem highlights one of the specific ways  communicative  capitalism  captures  critique  and  resistance,  formatting  them  as  contributions  to  the  circuits  in  which  it  thrives.3 The temporal take-over of theory displaces sustained  critical thought, replacing it with the sense that there isn’t time  for  thinking,  that  there  are  only  emergencies  to  which  one  must react, that one can’t keep up and might as well not try. The second side of the problem, the form of theory’s pre- sentation, likewise highlights how communicative capitalism  fragments thought into ever smaller bits, bits that can be dis- tributed and sampled, even ingested and enjoyed, but that in  the  glut  of  multiple,  circulating  contributions  tend  to  resist  recombination into longer, more demanding theories. It’s like  today we can have and share insights, but these insights must  not  add  up  to  something  like  a  theory  that  might  aid  us  in  understanding,  critically  confronting,  and  politically  restruc- turing the present. Theodor Adorno’s criticism of the passion  for information in mass culture applies more to contemporary  communication  and  entertainment  networks  than  it  did  to  film and radio, the mass media he has in mind when he writes,  “However useful it might be from a practical point of view to  have as much information as possible at one’s disposal, there  still prevails the iron law that the information in question shall  never touch the essential, shall never degenerate into thought.”4  As  multiple-recombinant  ideas  and  images  circulate,  stimu- late,  they  distract  us  from  the  antagonisms  constitutive  of  contemporary society, inviting us to think that each opinion is  equally valid, each option is equally likely, and each click is a  significant  political  intervention.  The  deluge  of  images  and  announcements, enjoining us to react, to feel, to forward them   C2  DBG_01.indd   2  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  3  to our friends, erodes critical-theoretical capacities – aren’t they  really  just  opinions  anyway?  Feelings  dressed  up  in  jargon?  Drowning in plurality, we lose the capacity to grasp anything  like  a  system.  React  and  forward,  but  don’t  by  any  means  think.  My wager is that critical media theory is possible in book  form.  The  wager  is  inspired  by  a  time-honored  tactic  in  workers’  struggle:  the  slow-down.  As  an  object  whose  form  installs delays in sampling and syndication and whose content  demands postponed gratification, the book mobilizes the gap  of mediacy so as to stimulate thought. E-books and articles as  well as blog posts on theoretical topics are convenient ways to  store  and  share  ideas.  But  these  benefits  come  at  a  cost:  we  pay with attention.5 It’s easy to give into the temptation to keep  moving, to follow links, to see what others think about it before  one  even  knows  what  “it”  might  be,  then  to  see  what  else  others  are  thinking  about,  especially  if  their  posts  aren’t  too  long  .  .  .  and  once  we’re  already  a  few  clicks  in,  why  not  go  ahead and check our blog stats, update our Facebook profiles,  and  engage  in  a  few  rounds  of  Mafia  Wars  or  other  games  helpfully supplied by our favorite social network. It only takes  a minute. Or two.  More  important,  though,  is  whether  the  technologies  and  practices  of  new  media  are  appropriate  objects  for  critical- theoretical inquiry. Again, my wager is yes. This isn’t a risky  bet. In recent decades, scholars, artists, and activists working  at the interface of communications, media, and cultural studies  and  social  studies  of  science  and  technology  have  developed  critical approaches to digital media and their networked envi- ronments.  Rather  than  restricted  to  positivist  methods  of  description and measurement or linear, developmentalist, his- tories of technical change, this emerging critical media theory  anchors its analyses of technologies, users, and practices in an  avowedly political assessment of the present.  What that assessment is, or, more specifically, how to theo- rize the political implications of networked communications  and entertainment media, is a matter of passionate disagree- ment. I take the position that contemporary communications  media capture their users in intensive and extensive networks   C2  DBG_01.indd   3  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   4  Blog	Settings  of enjoyment, production, and surveillance. My term for this  formation is communicative capitalism. Just as industrial capi- talism relied on the exploitation of labor, so does communica- tive capitalism rely on the exploitation of communication. As  Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri argue, “communication is  the  form  of  capitalist  production  in  which  capital  has  suc- ceeded in submitting society entirely and globally to its regime,  suppressing  all  alternative  paths.”6  A  critical  theory  of  com- municative  capitalism  requires  occupying   rather  than  dis- avowing   the  trap  in  which  it  enthralls  and  configures  contemporary  subjects.  I  argue  that  this  trap  takes  the  form  that  modern  European  philosophy  heralded  as  the  form  of  freedom:  reflexivity.  Communicative  capitalism  is  that  eco- nomic-ideological form wherein reflexivity captures creativity  and resistance so as to enrich the few as it placates and diverts  the many.  2  Communicative  capitalism  designates  the  strange  conver- gence of democracy and capitalism in networked communica- tions and entertainment media. On the one hand, networked  communications technologies materialize the values heralded  as  central  to  democracy.  Democratic  ideals  of  access,  inclu- sion, discussion, and participation are realized in and through  expansions and intensifications of global telecommunication  networks.  On  the  other  hand,  the  speed,  simultaneity,  and  interconnectivity  of  electronic  communications  produce  massive distortions and concentrations of wealth as commu- nicative  exchanges  and  their  technological  preconditions  become commodified and capitalized. David Harvey explains,  “technologies of information creation and capacities to accu- mulate, store, transfer, analyze, and use massive databases to  guide decisions in the global marketplace” have been neces- sary  and  essential  components  of  globalized  neoliberalism.7  As the network of networks through which such transactions  take  place,  the  internet  is  the  vehicle  and  terrain  for  politics  and  the  economy.  Changes  in  communication  technologies   C2  DBG_01.indd   4  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  5  associated with digitalization, speed  of computer processors  as well as connectivity , and memory storage capacity impact  democracy  and  capitalism,  amplifying  elements  of  each  as  they consolidate the two into a new ideological formation.  The  concept  of  communicative  capitalism  draws  from  Žižek’s Lacanian-Marxist upgrade of ideology critique. Žižek  uses  the  psychoanalysis  of  Jacques  Lacan  to  reconfigure  the  notion of ideology so as to theorize the ways our deepest com- mitments  bind  us  to  practices  of  domination.  Rather  than  following the commonplace notion that ideology is false con- sciousness  or  a  term  for  ideas  one  doesn’t  like   the  ideas  of  one’s opponents or everybody except the critic , Žižek formats  ideology in terms of the beliefs underlying practice. Ideology  is what we do, even when we know better  for example, I know  that  quizzes  on  Facebook  are  ingenious  ways  of  collecting  information from me and my friends, but I take them anyway .  The psychoanalytic notion of fetishism provides a convenient  shorthand: “I know, but nevertheless.  .  .  .”  An  additional  Žižekian  concept   one  he  develops  from  Claude Lévi-Strauss  important for theorizing communicative  capitalism  is  the  decline  of  symbolic  efficiency   aka  the  col- lapse of the big Other . If the efficiency of a symbol designates  its mobility, its ability to transmit significance not simply from  one  person  to  another  but  from  one  setting  to  another,  the  decline of symbolic efficiency points to an immobility or failure  of transmission. Blogs provide a clear example: sometimes it’s  difficult to tell when a blog or a post is ironic and when it’s  sincere, when it’s funny or when it’s serious. Terms and styles  of  expression  that  make  sense  to  an  “in-group”  can  shock,  insult, or enrage folks who just happen upon a blog. Moreover,  the uncertainty, the potential for unexpected meanings, pro- vides its own affective intensity. Images and affects may flow  into the gaps left by the declining symbolic. Despite the fact  that  bloggers  generally  decry  the  degeneration  of  discussion  into  ad  hominem  attacks  and  flame  wars  –  nearly  always  the  result of a misunderstanding rather than a disagreement – we  secretly  enjoy  them.  Hit  rates  double,  even  triple.  People  become  invested  in,  energized  by  the  exchange:  how  far  will  she go? She said that!? Oh no she didn’t! Pwnd!8  C2  DBG_01.indd   5  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   6  Blog	Settings  In my first months as a blogger, I had to figure out what  my deleting and blocking policy would be. Which comments  would  I  let  remain  and  which  would  I  block?  I  knew  that  simply disagreeing with me would not be grounds for deletion  –  after  all,  I  wanted  the  blog  to  be  a  site  for  discussion.  I  decided to delete comments that included explicit racist, sexist,  homophobic,  and  anti-Semitic  slurs.  Then  I  got  a  comment  from  the  GNAA  or  Gay  Nigger  Association  of  America,  a  group  of  organized  anti-blogging  trolls  who  take  their  name  from  a  1992  Danish  movie,  Gay-Niggers  from  Outerspace.  GNAA claims that it promotes neither racism nor homopho- bia  but  aims  rather  to  sow  disruption  on  the  internet.  The  comment  on  my  blog  was  a  minor  instance  of  their  more  extensive disruptive practices  like “crapflooding” a site with a  massive amount of text or data with no meaning or relevance:  for example, a word, phrase, or group of letters repeated over  and over, or producing hoax or shock sites and inserting links  or code that redirect viewers to the site .9  The concept of the decline of symbolic efficiency is particu- larly useful for critical media theory as it designates the fun- damental  uncertainty  accompanying  the  impossibility  of  totalization:  that  is,  of  fully  anchoring  or  pinning  down  meaning.10  The  contemporary  setting  of  electronically  medi- ated subjectivity is one of infinite doubt, ultimate reflexiviza- tion. There’s always another option, link, opinion, nuance, or  contingency that we haven’t taken into account, some particu- lar experience of some other who could be potentially damaged  or disenfranchised, a better deal, perhaps even a cure. The very  conditions of possibility for adequation  for determining the  criteria by which to assess whether a decision or answer is, if  not good, then at least adequate  have been foreclosed. It’s just  your  opinion.  Additionally,  as  the  efficiency  of  the  symbolic  declines, images and affective intensities may appear as all the  more  powerful,  relevant,  and  effective.  A  picture  is  worth  a  thousand words.  Žižek  uses  Lacan  to  express  the  point  as  a  suspension  of  the function of the Master signifier: there is no longer a Master  signifier  stabilizing  meaning,  knitting  together  the  chain  of  signifiers and hindering its tendencies to float off into inde-  C2  DBG_01.indd   6  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  7  terminacy.11 The absence of such a Master might suggest a new  setting of complete openness and freedom – no authority tells  the  subject  what  to  do,  what  to  desire,  how  to  structure  its  choices. Žižek argues, however, that in fact the result of the  Master’s  decline  is  unbearable,  suffocating  closure.12  The  online  environment  Second  Life  clearly  demonstrates  this  closure: able to do or create anything  there aren’t even laws  of gravity , the majority of users end up with avatars that are  sexier versions of themselves walking around shopping, gam- bling, fixing up their houses, and trying to meet people  “meet”  can be read euphemistically here . It’s not only boring – it’s  stifling  as  it  confronts  users  with  their  lack  of  skills  and  imagination.  Žižek’s account of the decline of symbolic efficiency appears  in  the  context  of  his  critique  of  risk  society  theory.  Some  of  the primary themes of this account extend ideas he had previ- ously  put  to  work  in  early  essays  on  cyberspace  and  virtual  reality. In contrast with a dominant strand of nineties media  theory, which treated virtual reality as a new, lawless frontier,  Žižek’s  essays  on  cyberspace  emphasize  the  virtuality  of  the  symbolic order of meaning and language. The functioning of  the  Master  signifier  depends  on  virtuality.  It  works  not  as  simply as another element in a chain, but as something that  is  more  than  itself,  something  present  as  potential.  Žižek  draws  an  example  from  Freud:  the  threat  of  castration  has  castrating effects.13 Cyberspace threatens precisely this funda- mental  virtuality.  The  paradox:  cyberspace  is  not  virtual  enough.  Žižek considers several specific ways virtuality is threatened  by  computer-mediated  interaction.  One  is  the  loss  of  the  binding  power  or  performative  efficacy  of  words.  Words  are  no  longer  “subjectivized”  insofar  as  they  fail  to  induce  the  subject  to  stand  by  them.  At  any  moment,  visitors  to  cyber- space can simply “unhook” themselves. Since exit is an option  with nearly no costs, subjects lose the incentive for their word  to be their bond. A second threat involves the dissolution of  the boundary between fantasy and reality, a dissolution affect- ing identity and desire. Insofar as digital environments enable  the realization of fantasies on the textual screen, they close the   C2  DBG_01.indd   7  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   8  Blog	Settings  gaps between the subject’s symbolic identity and its phantas- mic background.14 Instant gratification fills in the lack consti- tutive of desire. Hypertextual play enables the unstated subtext  of any text to be brought to the fore, thereby eliminating the  textual effects of the unsaid. Put somewhat differently, fanta- sies that are completely realized cease to be fantasies.15 A reper- cussion of this filling-in is a third threat, a threat to meaning.  The  gap  of  signification,  the  minimal  difference  that  makes  some item or answer significant, that makes it “feel right” or  “the one” dissipates. But instead of eliminating the space of  doubt,  the  filling-in  occasions  the  loss  of  the  possibility  of  feeling  convinced,  of  the  sense  that  an  answer  can  be  or  is  “right”  rather  than  just  another  opinion.  Žižek  asks,  “Is  not  one of the possible reactions to the excessive filling-in of the  voids in cyberspace therefore informational anorexia, the des- perate  refusal  to  accept  information,  in  so  far  as  it  occludes  the presence of the Real?”16 It’s like the feast of information  results  in  a  more  fundamental  starvation  as  one  loses  the  sense of an underlying Real.  At stake in all three threats – to performativity, desire, and  meaning  –  is  cyberspace’s  foreclosure  of  the  symbolic   the  elimination  of  the  space  of  the  signifier  as  it  slides  into  the  Real, which thereby itself loses the capacity to appear as Real .  Žižek  treats  this  foreclosure  of  the  symbolic  in  the  terms  of  paranoid psychosis: the Other is both missing and fully, over- whelmingly  present.17  Yet  he  doesn’t  presume  the  subject’s  absorption in the imaginary jouissance of a pre-Oedipal primal  oneness. Žižek is careful to note that such an image of friction- free  immersion  is  “cyberspace  capitalism’s”  own  ideological  fantasy, a fantasy of a society without antagonism. What’s at  stake,  then,  is  post-Oedipal,  an  order  that  doesn’t  rely  on  a  Master signifier.18 In this order, the Real presence of the Other  is lost as the lack in the Other is filled in. The something extra,  the inexpressible mystery or objet petit a that makes the Other  Real is subsumed by one who is “over-present, bombarding me  with  the  torrential  flow  of  images  and  explicit  statements  of  her   or  his   most  secret  fantasies.”19  Thus,  correlative  to  the  absence of the Real Other are the unbearable intrusions of the  other’s jouissance.20  C2  DBG_01.indd   8  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  9  In sum, the central insight of Žižek’s early work on cyber- space involves the change to the symbolic. Žižek argues that  the  gaps  in  the  symbolic   the  gaps  that  enable  access  to  the  Real  insofar  as  the  Real  cannot  be  approached  directly   are  filled  in   saturating  “the  virtual  space  of  symbolic  fiction” .21  The result is a situation of non-desire, non-meaning, and the  unbearable intrusion of enjoyment. This decline in symbolic  efficiency  is  a  fundamental  feature  of  communicative  capitalism.  3  The change in the functioning of the symbolic is linked to the  reflexivity  of  complex  technological  societies.  Risk  society  theory highlights the harms and threats emerging out increases  in complexity. Ulrich Beck, for example, points out that prob- lems ranging from environmental toxicity and climate change  to  obesity,  diabetes,  and  the  threats  posed  by  corporate  agri- culture  are  all  problems  produced  by  the  very  technological  changes introduced to meet earlier challenges  rapid, efficient  transportation, secure and comfortable habitats, adequate food  and water, etc. .22 His point is that scientific knowledge gener- ates new risks and uncertainties. Rather than providing clear  answers, it opens up new questions, pushing us to recognize  not  only  that  there  are  unknown  unknowns,  but  that  these  unknowns  can  and  will  have  massive,  unforeseen  effects.23  Insofar as the effects are unforeseen, they are highly improb- able.  Insofar  as  they  are  networked,  these  effects  are  com- pounded.  The  consequences  of  their  occurrence,  therefore,  can be extreme.  During the spring and summer of 2008, mainstream news  media expressed anxieties over the imminent start-up of the  Large Hadron Collider at CERN  European Center for Nuclear  Research   in  Switzerland.  A  German  scientist,  Otto  Rössler,  appealed to the European Court of Human Rights to issue an  injunction  that  would  prevent  activation  of  the  collider.  He  argued  that  the  risk  to  human  life  was  too  great.  The  Large  Hadron Collider could create miniature black holes capable of   C2  DBG_01.indd   9  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   10  Blog	Settings  destroying the planet: “My own calculations have shown that  it is quite plausible that these little black holes survive and will  grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside.”24 In a  2003 report, CERN had said that black holes were not a con- ceivable risk, although it addressed in detail the possible cre- ation  of  “strangelets,”  hypothetical  particles  that  “could  transform the Earth almost instantly into a dead, dense lump.”25  It  concluded  that  this  was  unlikely.  Nonetheless,  even  with  various expert commissions reviewing the scientific evidence,  the  problem  of  assessing  the  relation  of  risk  to  probability  remained. How is valuation of the existence of the planet and  its future generations even possible, particularly in a situation  so extreme as to render prediction a kind of high-stakes gam- bling? After all, a basic premise of quantum mechanics is that  most  anything  could  happen,  even  if  its  likelihood  is  very  small.  Žižek writes:  There is a priori no proper measure between the “excess” of scare- mongering  and  the  indecisive  procrastination  of  “Don’t  let’s  panic, we don’t yet have conclusive results.”.  .  .  Again, this impen- etrability is not simply a matter of “complexity,” but of reflexivity:  the new opaqueness and impenetrability  the radical uncertainty  of the consequences of our actions  is not due to the fact that we  are  puppets  in  the  hands  of  some  transcendent  global  Power   Fate, Historical Necessity, the Market ; on the contrary, it is due  to the fact that “nobody is in charge,” that there is no such power,  no  “Other  of  the  Other”  pulling  the  strings  –  opaqueness  is  grounded  in  the  very  fact  that  today’s  society  is  thoroughly  “reflexive”.  .  .  .26  Human inquiry into the world affects the world. Our relation  to  the  world  and  to  each  other  is  reflexive.  Mark  C.  Taylor  explains that “cause and effect are independent: the thoughts  and  actions  of  agents  influence  the  operation  of  the  system,  which, in turn, influences the thoughts and actions of agents.”27  A crucial fact of contemporary life is that more than persisting  as an environment we might try to know and understand, the  world is also a dynamic effect of our interventions into it – and  we  know  this.  Hence,  we  know  we  impact  the  world,  but  we   C2  DBG_01.indd   10  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  11  don’t know exactly how. Neither do nor can we know with any  certainty  the  ways  that  our  current  practices  produce  some  futures while excluding others. We just know that there will  be  consequences  and  side-effects  that  we  have  not  foreseen  and that some of these consequences and side-effects will be  devastating to some people. A solution to one problem creates  countless others.  As Beck points out, scientists’ preoccupation with expected  effects determines the research process as it channels the lines  of inquiry in some directions rather than others. The causality  here is recursive: “the actual consequences ultimately become  more  and  more  incalculable,  because  the  possible  effects  become more and more estimable and their assessment takes  place more and more in the research process and in interac- tion with its inherent taboo zones, and determine those zones  in  the  course  of  results.”28  Even  our  estimations  of  possible  effects have an impact on the world – that we cannot predict.  Excesses  of  information  turn  into  a  lack  of  the  information  most relevant to the questions at hand.  Contemporary science and technology offer an unbearable,  seemingly impossible freedom: the capacity to intervene in the  world  at  the  most  fundamental  levels  of  matter  and  energy  without  being  restricted  by  knowledge  of  the  outcome.  Reflection is possible; reflection on the processes and condi- tions of reflection, on the languages we use and the sciences  we have, on the values that lead us in one direction rather than  another.29 Yet this universalized reflexivity cannot determine  for  us  what  we  ought  to  do;  we  are  free  to  do  whatever  we  decide to do, without determination and without cover in some  larger,  complete,  full  knowledge,  without,  in  other  words,  a  big Other to ground and secure us. Reflexivity, reflexivity that  goes all the way down, is thus another name for the decline in  symbolic efficiency. The recursive loop is the circuit of the big  Other’s collapse.  One of Beck’s examples of the high-consequence, destabi- lizing effects of reflexivity is global financial markets. Bubbles,  band-wagon  effects,  and  boom-and-bust  cycles  result  from  investors’  attempts  to  predict  how  others  will  perceive  the  future even as these very predictions bring a particular future   C2  DBG_01.indd   11  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   12  Blog	Settings  into being. In the words of economist Hyman Minksy  who,  having been treated as a fringe thinker by mainstream econo- mists, became better known and more frequently cited in the  wake of the economic crises of 2008 : “The normal function- ing of our economy leads to financial trauma and crises, infla- tion,  currency  depreciations,  unemployment  and  poverty  in  the midst of what could be virtually universal affluence – in  short  .  .  .  financially complex capitalism is inherently flawed.”30  Beck,  though,  refers  not  to  Minsky  but  to  financier  George  Soros.31 In a number of books, Soros explains his success as a  hedge  fund  manager  in  terms  of  what  he  calls  a  “theory  of  reflexivity.”32  Contra  mainstream  economics  and  like  Minsky,  Soros  emphasizes the points of disequilibrium where markets break  down. His argument is that markets are not only inefficient  but  that  belief  in  equilibrium  contributes  to  boom-and-bust  cycles  insofar  as  markets  are  expected  to  be  self-correcting.  The reflexivity of market actors with imperfect knowledge  in  other words, all market actors  as well as their knowledge that  others  with  imperfect  knowledge  are  nonetheless  making  investment decisions produces situations of high volatility and  low predictability. Again, as Beck makes clear in his discussion  of  attempts  to  predict  and  prevent  ill  effects  of  scientific  research,  reflexivity  leads  to  uncertainty  and  indeterminacy.  One can’t be sure what others are doing, and one’s guess about  what they’re doing influences what they do.  Nassim  Nicholas  Taleb  takes  Soros’s  argument  a  step  further:  most  of  our  habits  of  everyday  life  prevent  us  from  dealing well with uncertainty and indeterminacy. We assume  that events in the world around us fall into the shape of a bell- curve  like human height does  and attend rather less to dis- tributions  that  follow  power  laws   like  citations  per  author,  book sales per author, blog hits, film revenues, wealth of indi- vidual capitalists . Hoping and expecting events to fall into a  regular pattern, we systematically underestimate the impact of  outliers  –  and  this  underestimation  itself  has  effects.  Like  Beck,  Taleb  emphasizes  the  ways  that  the  supposition  that  risks  can  be  measured  results  in  the  exclusion  of  extreme   C2  DBG_01.indd   12  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  13  events,  precisely  the  sorts  of  events  –  a  once-a-century  eco- nomic crisis or the crash of a very large asteroid into the earth  –  that  can  change  everything   like  Soros,  Taleb  was  able  to  capitalize on others’ failures to allow for extreme events . For  all three – Beck, Soros, Taleb – the reflexive structure of com- municative  capitalism’s  fast,  ubiquitous  networks  increases  the  likelihood  and  impact  of  high-consequence  events.  In  Taleb’s words, “the world in which we live has an increasing  number of feedback loops, causing events to be the cause of  more events  .  .  .  thus generating snowballs and arbitrary and  unpredictable  planet-wide  winner-take-all  effects.  We  live  in  an environment where information flows too rapidly, acceler- ating  such  epidemics.”33  More  circuits,  more  loops,  more  spoils for the first, strongest, richest, fastest, biggest.34  Žižek accepts risk society theorists’ emphasis on the uncer- tainty at the heart of reflexivity, but he argues that they don’t  go  far  enough.  They  fail  to  consider  the  effects  of  reflexivity  on contemporary subjectivity, effects that may involve the sub- ject’s attachment to new forms of subjection as a way to ease  the pressures of the injunctions to succeed, be more, be better,  be real, and enjoy. Elsewhere, I explore these effects as they  appear in modes of subjectivization constellated around con- spiracy thinking and celebrity.35 In chapter 2, I consider some- thing like the underside or obverse of these modes, the failed  subjectivization  of  whatever  being.  At  stake  is  the  relation  between  the  reflexivity  of  communicative  capitalism  and  the  reflexivity of the subject. Modern European thought construed  the autonomy of the subject in terms of its capacity for reflec- tion. Contemporary political theory likewise views democracy  reflexively: democratic procedures are forms and vehicles for  self-governance; we make the laws we apply to ourselves and  these laws make us the people we are. When reflexivity goes  all the down, however, reconfiguring the very form of subjec- tivity  into  new  sorts  of  fluid,  vulnerable  singularities,  every  aspect and form of which is mutable and contingent, the endless  loop of reflexivity becomes the very form of capture and absorption.  A completely reflexive self is as incompatible with democracy  as reflexive self-governance is with fully reflexive subjects.  C2  DBG_01.indd   13  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   14  Blog	Settings  4  Even as critical thinkers in sociology, psychoanalysis, and eco- nomics  consider  the  extremes  produced  in  the  circuits  of  reflexivity,  techno-enthusiasts  write  as  if  reflexivity  were  the  solution to a wide range of social and political problems. Much  of this writing relies on the migration of concepts from cyber- netic  and  complexity  theory  into  commentary  on  contempo- rary  society,  a  migration  enabled  by  the  rapid  growth  of  networked communications.36 As computers became tools for  everyday  life,  so  did  the  language  of  computer  networks  suggest ways to analyze everyday life.  Among the many popular books documenting, celebrating,  and  ushering  in  ubiquitous  computing  is  Steven  Johnson’s  Emergence:  The  Connected  Lives  of  Ants,  Brains,  Cities,  and  Software. As the title suggests, Johnson’s underlying assump- tion is that fundamental patterns not only govern but connect  seemingly disparate areas of experience: the habits of insects,  the neural networks of the human brain, physical interactions  among  large  groups  of  people,  and  software  code.  In  all  of  these,  Johnson  locates  “emergent  behavior,”  patterns  and  systems that arise and achieve equilibrium through local rules  and  simple  feedback  processes.  The  most  striking  aspect  of  emergent behavior is no one commands its patterns to arise  or dictates the structures that emerge. Rather, emergent behav- ior results from “self-organization.”  Johnson  understands  self-organization  in  terms  of  sets  of  opposed concepts: centralized v. decentralized, unified v. dis- tributed, top-down v. bottom-up, and planned v. random. For  him,  the  second  term  in  each  pair  is  both  the  ideal  and  the  future that we are just beginning to understand. He can valo- rize  these  second  terms  because  he  presumes  equilibrium:  that  is,  he  prioritizes  homeostasis  as  the  baseline,  expected,  and default position. Johnson acknowledges that extreme con- ditions  –  chaos,  clusters,  hubs,  frenzies  –  are  effects  of  self- organization, but he thinks that self-organization provides the  solution to the instability it creates. The mechanism for this  solution is feedback.  C2  DBG_01.indd   14  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  15  Johnson’s  account  of  feedback  relies  on  two  stories,  one  about  the  1992  media  feeding  frenzy  over  President  Bill  Clinton’s alleged affair with Gennifer Flowers and one about  the proliferation of “cranks”  trolls  in online discussions. The  media brouhaha, he argues, was the result of insufficient nega- tive feedback: “The Flowers episode was an instance of pure  positive  feedback,  unchecked  by  its  opposing  force.  Each  agent’s behavior encouraged more like-minded behavior from  other  agents.  There  was  nothing  homeostatic  about  the  process  .  .  .”37  The  tendency  of  online  discussion  threads  to  disintegrate into snark results from the opposite problem. The  imbalance between participants and lurkers  those who make  points and those who just read them  in threaded discussions  enables contrarians to derail conversations. The lack of feed- back  encourages  them  to  keep  up  their  attacks.  With  more  feedback, though, even online conversations would approach  equilibrium.  Johnson writes:  When you factor in the lurkers, a threaded discussion turns out  to  be  less  interactive  than  a  traditional  face-to-face  lecture,  and  significantly  less  so  than  a  conversation  around  a  dinner  table,  where  even  the  most  reticent  participants  contribute  with  ges- tures  and  facial  expressions.  Group  conversations  in  the  real  world  have  an  uncanny  aptitude  for  reaching  a  certain  kind  of  homeostasis: the conversation moves toward a zone that pleases  as  much  of  the  group  as  possible  and  drowns  out  voices  that  offend.  A  group  conversation  is  a  kind  of  circuit  board,  with  primary inputs coming from the official speakers, and secondary  inputs  coming  from  the  responses  of  the  audience  and  other  speakers.  The  primary  inputs  adjust  their  signal  based  on  the  secondary inputs of group feedback. Human beings  .  .  .  are excep- tionally  talented  at  assessing  the  mental  states  of  other  people,  both  through  the  direct  exchanges  of  spoken  language  and  the  more oblique feedback mechanisms of gesture and intonation.38  Johnson employs two analogies here. The first obvious one is  between human conversations and circuit boards. The second,  rather  less  obvious  one  is  between  computer-mediated  com- munication in large, complex, environments and face-to-face   C2  DBG_01.indd   15  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   16  Blog	Settings  interaction, either in a lecture hall or around a dinner table.  The  blurring  between  lecture  and  dinner  table  enables  the  analogy with the circuit board and the assumption of homeo- stasis.  Johnson  connects  primary  inputs  to  official  speakers  and secondary inputs to an audience.  Do  dinner-table  conversations  typically  involve  official  speakers  and  an  audience?  My  kids  would  say  yes,  but  they  would do so with a roll of their eyes so as to signal that this  isn’t ideal and that they would prefer dinner unencumbered  by  lectures  in  political  theory  and  psychoanalysis.  The  more  conventional  contrast  between  lecture  and  dinner-table  con- versation notes that a lecture is centralized and hierarchical; it  relies on the difference between the speaker and her audience.  The speaker may be on a stage or at a podium. Her audience  faces her, arranged in rows that ensure that people look pri- marily  at  her  rather  than  at  each  other.  Conversation  over  dinner  flows  among  the  participants.  Ideally,  a  distinction  between speaker and audience never solidifies. A group con- versation,  then,  is  nothing  like  a  circuit  board  that  relies  on  primary  and  secondary  inputs.  A  lecture  might  be  like  a  circuit  board,  not  because  of  feedback,  though,  but  because  the  institutional  structure  of  a  lecture  installs  hierarchy,  primacy. To make conversation look like a circuit board, then,  Johnson has to turn it into a lecture. And this inserts hierar- chy, centralization, and top-down organization into a setting  that  Johnson  was  attempting  to  depict  as  a  self-organizing  equilibrium.  The analogy with the lecture that enables conversation to be  understood in terms of primary and secondary inputs enables  Johnson to omit the complexities of actual human interaction  and present human beings as “exceptionally talented at assess- ing the mental states of other people.” There is no projection,  transference,  fantasy,  paranoia,  or  repression;  there  is  no  tension or mismatch between what one says and what another  hears, between what one says and what one means, or between  what one says and why one says it  elements of human interac- tion that psychoanalysis explores .  At the same time, by treating computer-mediated commu- nication in large, complex environments as if it were no dif-  C2  DBG_01.indd   16  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  17  ferent from face-to-face interaction, Johnson can downplay the  ways reflexivity leads to disequilibrium. For him, learning in  networked environments means that the extremes fall by the  wayside rather than becoming amplified as their effects extend  throughout the network. In effect, these extremes become the  unknown unknowns already undermining Johnson’s reassur- ing story of homeostasis.  Johnson’s  omission  of  complexity  and  unknowningness  points to a short-circuit in his account of reflexivity. He writes,  “the  new  software  will  use  the  tools  of  self-organization  to  build  models  of  our  own  mental  states.  .  .  .  They  will  be   mind  readers.”39  It  appears  that  his  account  of  emergence  depends  on  a  limit  that  he  fails  to  acknowledge.  Reflexivity  doesn’t go all the way down. If we assume  in an outrageous  flight  of  fancy   that  software  can  read  minds   as  if  minds   were made up, as if they were not conflicted, as if there were  no  unconscious ,  how  would  the  knowledge  we  have  of  the  contents  of  others’  minds  affect  our  communication  with  them?  And  what  about  our  knowledge  that  software  was  reading our minds? How would that impact our interactions  and  reactions?  Would  we  try  to  fake  out  the  software,  play  tricks on it? Would we comply, expecting our every demand  to be met such that we become increasingly infantile, unable  to tolerate any conflict or discomfort? Johnson neglects these  further reflexive twists, the ways that human knowledge has  material  effects  as  people  bring  futures  into  being  on  its   basis.  The block to reflexivity in Johnson’s account arises from the  oppositional sets structuring his analysis  not to mention the  fantasy-based techno-utopianism obscuring the possibilities of  surveillance and control – with mind-reading software, com- panies could deduct pay from workers’ day-dreaming on the  job; police states could use people’s fantasies of destruction as  criteria  for  putting  them  on  terrorist  watch  lists .  Johnson  wants  to  juxtapose  “self-organized”  to  “planned”  or  “con- trolled.”  Thus,  he  has  to  avoid  considering  the  networks   of  communication  between  people  that  he  treats  as  self-  organized as themselves already implicated in forms of control,  an inquiry which would require him to take up the unit that   C2  DBG_01.indd   17  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   18  Blog	Settings  “self” is supposed to designate as well as the ways planning,  institutions,  and  norms  are  vehicles  and  conditions  for  self- organization once one moves from ants to people.  In  her  discussion  of  nineties  controversies  over  the  self- organizing  structure  of  the  internet,  Tiziana  Terranova  sug- gests that a cybernetic definition of control is “the antithesis  of  centralized  government,  because  the  latter  presupposes  a  complete  knowledge  of  each  individual  component  of  the  overall system, which is impossible to achieve in these types  of structure.”40 One should add that not only is such knowl- edge impossible to achieve in any political structure, but also  that the invocation of such control as a critique of centralized  planning aims at a straw man: theories and practices of cen- tralized  government  have  never  been  based  on  complete  knowledge of each individual component – political power as  such is exercised as potential: that is, as a promise, expectation,  or threat.  Terranova notes that the “biological turn” that emphasizes  the life-like qualities of complex systems generally rejects gov- ernmentality as unsuited to the turbulent terrain of dynamic  networks and deregulated markets.41 This rejection, however,  overlooks  the  changes  in  governmentality  that  subjected  the  state  to  the  market.  As  Foucault  explores  in  his  lectures  on  neoliberalism, insofar as neoliberalism emphasizes the market  as a site of competition rather than exchange, it demands that  the  state  combat  anti-competitive  mechanisms  and  work  to  spread opportunities for competition. The state must be ever  vigilant in these efforts as well as vigilant about its own effi- ciency.  Moreover,  such  vigilance  is  exercised  not  just  with  regard  to  government,  as  its  operations  and  resources  are  privatized. Rather, neoliberalism entails a governmentality of  “active,  multiple,  vigilant,  and  omnipresent”  intervention  in  society,  an  intervention  exercised  through  and  by  multiple  networks traversing micro and macro domains.42  Johnson’s  account  of  emergence  presupposes  the  cyber- netic definition of control that Terranova invokes. With such  a  presupposition,  Johnson  cannot  acknowledge  reflexivity’s  emergence as a dynamic of control: that is, the ways that the  extremes  produced  by  the  circulation  of  information  them-  C2  DBG_01.indd   18  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   selves have effects on those of us captured in communicative  capitalism.  Blog	Settings  19  5  Fred Turner’s history of cyberculture puts in perspective both  Johnson’s infatuation with emergence and the sets of opposi- tional  categories  supporting  it.  Turner  focuses  on  the  “New  Communalists,”  the  1960s  Bay  Area  counterculture  move- ment. Crucial to Turner’s discussion is the transformation of  the computer from a tool of control, hierarchy, and dehuman- ization to computing as the technology of collaboration, flex- ibility,  and  utopian  social  change.  To  explain  how  this  happened,  Turner  distinguishes  between  the  New  Communalists  and  the  New  Left.  Whereas  the  New  Left  emphasized  political  struggle  –  that  is,  organizing  to  try  to  bring about a better world  registering voters, forming parties,  staging demonstrations  – for the New Communalists, “politi- cal activism was at best beside the point and at worst part of  the problem.”43 The New Communalists rejected left notions  of conflict, imagining instead a world of networks wherein the  most fundamental struggles were those of the individual for  the information he  and it was nearly always he  needed for  personal freedom and transformation.  The  central  figure  in  Turner’s  story  is  Stewart  Brand,  founder  of  the  Whole  Earth  Catalog  in  1968  and   with  com- puter entrepreneur Larry Brilliant  the influential teleconfer- encing  system  the  WELL   Whole  Earth  ‘Lectronic  Link   in  1985.  As  a  Stanford  undergraduate  at  the  end  of  the  fifties,  Brand  shared  the  concern  of  many  coming  of  age  during   the  Cold  War  –  fear  of  annihilation,  either  by  nuclear  war   or  by  the  stifling  conformity  of  mass  society.  Over  the   next  decades,  he  explored  positive  alternatives,  including   psychedelic  drugs,  performance  art,  communal  living,  the  teachings  of  Buckminster  Fuller,  personal  computing,  and  entrepreneurialism.  Brand’s skills as a networker, as well as his success in com- bining  metaphors  of  individual  consciousness,  energy,  and   C2  DBG_01.indd   19  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   20  Blog	Settings  self-organizing systems, contributed to the vision of collabora- tive, harmonious information networks that helped usher in  the  internet.  Turner  uses  the  Whole  Earth  Catalog  as  an  example. Including consumer items and information resources  as  seemingly  incongruous  as  mystical  fiction  and  geodesic  domes,  the  catalog  suggested  a  vision  of  life  that  combined  nomadic tribes and high-tech electronics in a frontier fantasy  of do-it-yourself American freedom. A libertarian fantasy, this  ideal  of  freedom  disavowed  its  position  within  a  capitalist  economy  and  concealed  its  dependence  on  other  people,  industries,  and  institutions.  The  right  technology  would  engender  total  individual  self-reliance,  in  effect  making  the  Kantian dream of autonomy a material reality.  Brand’s  New  Communalist  ideal  presented  itself  as  a  counter  to  the  militarist,  bureaucratic,  corporate  establish- ment. Turner details how the ideal actually embraced the most  fundamental  components  of  what  it  ostensibly  rejected,  namely,  “the  technocentric  optimism,  the  information  theo- ries, and the collaborative work style of the research world.”44  The  post-war  era’s  enormous  government-funded  research  projects, although housed in bureaucracies, actually employed  interdisciplinary teams working collaboratively across a variety  of fields and agencies. This collaborative ethos should not be  surprising:  the  development  of  large-scale  weapons  systems  required both a language capable of combining humans and  machines,  cybernetics,  and  tools  for  handling  knowledge,  computers. In taking over systems theory and the collaborative  practices  of  military  research,  then,  the  New  Communalists  assumed as their own the basic practices and suppositions of  their opponent.  Three  aspects  of  the  New  Communalist  adoption  of  the  military-research model of information and technology should  be kept in mind. The first is its core faith: technology will save  the world.45 Just as military planners thought that computers,  surveillance, information, and speed would defeat the enemy  in the future, so did the New Communalists follow the credo  that  the  proper  tools  make  anything  possible;  the  computer  thus appears as the universal tool making everything possible.  Second,  as  they  adopt  the  faith   information,  technology,   C2  DBG_01.indd   20  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  21  systems  while denying its institutions  military, bureaucracy,  corporation , the New Communalists “reintroduced many of  the core principles of research culture into American society  – but this time, as the intellectual foundations of a countercul- ture.”46  What  had  been  a  marker  and  instrument  of  oppres- sion  reversed  into  its  opposite.  Collaboration,  flexibility,  technological  skill,  and  the  capacity  to  generate  and  share  information  would  produce  not  imperial  control  but  new,  freer,  and  more  fulfilled  modes  of  being.  Third,  the  New  Communalist adoption of cybernetics and reproduction of its  logics as liberating contributed to political, economic, and cul- tural change: the rise of neoliberalism. By the end of the eight- ies,  the  new  “digerati”   some  of  whom  had  participated  in  conferences organized by Brand  could successfully apply the  New Communalist formula of conjoining “the cultural legiti- macy of the counterculture to the technological and economic  legitimacy  of  the  computer  industry.”47  In  1987,  Brand  co- founded the Global Business Network, a consulting firm that  encouraged collaborative research and organizational practice.  Its clients included “the same corporate and military institu- tions  that  the  New  Communalists  and  the  New  Left  had  condemned.”48  Turner’s history of cyberculture provides the broader setting  in which Johnson’s oppositional sets – centralized v. decentral- ized,  unified  v.  distributed,  top-down  v.  bottom-up,  and  planned v. random – may have at one time made sense. The  New  Communalists  understood  their  project  as  countercul- tural,  a  rejection  of  the  establishment  world  that  threatened  them with absorption in a technocratic project not of their own  making. Because they opposed the military–industrial complex,  state  centralism,  and  hierarchical  corporate  structures,  they  presented their efforts toward individual empowerment, infor- mation  sharing,  and  networked  collaboration  as  necessarily  counter to these forms of control. In this way, they missed how  the  military,  state,  corporation,  and  university  were  already  functioning in distributed, decentralized networks. Thus, they  failed  to  acknowledge  how  their  ostensibly  countercultural  practices themselves served as the conduits for spreading the  communication and control mechanisms of the technocratic   C2  DBG_01.indd   21  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   22  Blog	Settings  research world not just throughout just US society but, via the  internet, throughout most of the world. The very mechanisms  that  were  supposed  to  enable  local  practices,  freedom  from  commercial, corporate expectations, and opportunities to cul- tivate a variety of ways of being produced the networks through  which communicative capitalism ensnares speech and action. Christopher  Kelty’s  notion  of  “recursive  publics”  should  also  be  understood  in  light  of  the  reversal  of  the  terms  and  practices  of  the  state  and  corporation  into  the  oppositional  categories  of  the  counterculture  and  back  into  those  of  the  neoliberal  state.  Kelty  introduces  “recursive  publics”  in  his  ethnography of “Free Software.” For him, Free Software is a  movement  that  extends  out  from  technical  software  projects  to encompass “a considerable reorientation of knowledge and  power in contemporary society – a reorientation of power with  respect  to  the  creation,  dissemination,  and  authorization  of  knowledge in the era of the Internet.”49 More than the initial  practices of the programmers whose work built the internet,  more than the efforts of hackers and geeks to liberate propri- etary source code, and more than the legal struggles around  copyright  and  fair  use,  Free  Software,  Kelty  argues,  is  about  equality, fairness, and justice.  This interpretation of Free Software rests on the articulation  of values of individual empowerment, collaboration, and infor- mation sharing ushered in by Brand and his New Communalists.  Kelty repeatedly points out that Free Software is not opposed  to  capitalism.  He  gestures   with  apparent  enthusiasm  and  approval   to  the  libertarian  impulses  of  the  Brand-affiliated  technophiles  grouped  around  Wired  in  the  early  nineties,  Esther Dyson, Howard Rheingold, and John Perry Barlow. He  cites  uncritically  a  “famous  bit  of  Internet-governance  folk- lore”: “We reject kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in  rough consensus and running code.”50 The “reorientation of  knowledge and power” that Kelty describes is the reorientation  at  the  basis  of  communicative  capitalism,  the  reorientation  behind the last thirty years of neoliberal excess and its increases  in inequality and immiseration that have paraded around as  expansions  in  information,  flexibility,  participation,  and  responsiveness. Presuming that the work of programmers is   C2  DBG_01.indd   22  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  23  analogous to politics, Kelty routes around conflict, as if working  code were the solution to any problem rather than a particular  set  of  problems.  Likewise  proceeding  as  if  government  and  market  were  the  same,  Kelty  absorbs  concerns  with  public  goods and the well-being of the many into private interests, an  absorption  that  benefits  the  very,  very  rich  and  eviscerates  states’ abilities to pay for social security generally understood.  He  omits  the  fact  that  the  reorientation  of  knowledge  and  power he describes has ushered in the winner-take-almost-all  markets of extreme neoliberalism. Geeks may be about equal- ity,  fairness,  and  justice  among  each  other   or,  as  is  more  likely,  they  may  be  about  competition  and  glory,  killer  apps  and venture capital . How they feel isn’t the point, particularly  when  these  feelings  displace  attention  from  communicative  capitalism’s  installation  of  heretofore  unseen  extremes  of  inequality because the reflexivity of complex networks leads to  power law distributions.51 Even if geeks are “about” justice and  equality,  the  consequence  of  the  widespread  adoption  and  extension of their work is the most extreme economic inequal- ity the world has ever known.  Kelty writes:  The proliferation of hybrid commercial–academic forms in an era  of  modifiability  and  reusability,  among  the  debris  of  standards,  standards  processes,  and  new  experiments  in  intellectual  prop- erty, results in a playing field with a thousand different games, all  of which revolve around renewed experimentation with coordina- tion,  collaboration,  adaptability,  design,  evolution,  gaming,  playing, worlds, and worlding. These games are indicative of the  triumph of the American love of entrepreneurialism and experi- mentalism; they relinquish the ideals of planning and hierarchy  almost absolutely in favor of a kind of embedded, technically and  legally  complex  anarchism.  It  is  here  that  the  idea  of  a  public  reemerges: the ambivalence between relinquishing control abso- lutely and absolute distrust of government by the few.52  Like Johnson and like the New Communalists, Kelty relies on  an opposition between planning and experimentation and top- down v. bottom-up. At the same time as he disavows the ways  the “thousand different games” result in an absolute disparity   C2  DBG_01.indd   23  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   24  Blog	Settings  between the one who wins and the many who lose  hey, they  all got to play, right? , he treats law as just another element of  a  complex  market  rather  than  a  means  by  which  the  people  govern themselves. In an age where lawyers employed by the  administration  of  George  W.  Bush  use  legal  complexities  to  argue for the legality of torture and economists with the Barack  Obama administration use legal complexities to enable massive  redistributions  of  public  funds  to  private  banks,  “legally  complex anarchism” skirts way too close to illegality: that is,  to  a  suspension  of  law  in  the  celebration  of  its  gaps  and  exceptions.  More  objectionable,  though,  is  Kelty’s  treatment  of  the  games of entrepreneurs as the same as public supervision of  the activities of elected representatives, even when, especially  when,  their  activities  are  not  connected  with  government- sponsored public projects. In the scenario Kelty describes, the  builders of communication networks are governing the rest of  us  proceeding without our consent and generally beneath our  awareness . They are a technocratic elite unburdened by con- straints  of  representation  or  oversight.  The  programmers  don’t  just  build  software;  they  act  for  the  people  –  although  this acting is itself formatted in terms of communicative capi- talism’s merging of markets and governance.  What  makes  geek  jobs   whether  voluntary,  freelance,  or  corporate   the  activities  of  a  demos?  To  whom  are  the  geeks  accountable?  Who  oversees  them?  Who  determines  whether  what they’ve made is good, right, or legitimate? What if non- geeks  want  to  participate?  Or  what  if  they  understand  their  creative, productive, affective work as the proper field of politi- cal  determination?  Kelty  claims  that  “recursive  publics”   the  only example of which is Free Software  are democratic checks  on constituted power.53 They may well be checks, but they are  checks without authorization or legitimacy, checks motivated  by  the  “entrepreneurial  and  experimental”  interests  of  those  who work in telecommunications networks. There is nothing  “democratic” about them.  I  can  approach  this  point  from  another  direction.  Jürgen  Habermas initially developed the notion of the public sphere  as  a  category  of  bourgeois  society.  The  public  sphere  was  a   C2  DBG_01.indd   24  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  25  form for subjecting absolutism to the political authority of the  bourgeoisie. Publicity functioned as a principle of control that  remade the political in its own terms, even as this very remak- ing  “renounce[d]  the  form  of  claim  to  rule.”54  Paradoxically,  publicity as an ideal emerged as a counter-power via associa- tions  that  were  secret  and  exclusive:  the  ideals  of  publicity  initially circulated in secret societies like Freemasonry.  Reinhart Koselleck, whose Critique and Crisis preceded and  influenced Habermas’s Structural Transformation of the Public  Sphere,  views  these  secret  societies  as  crucial  to  publicity’s  remaking of the political. They were the means through which  the aura of power was transferred from the mysteries of the  monarch to the arcana of the lodges. These institutions were  secret inner spaces within the absolutist state, spaces that were  separated from the political by the very mysteries whose pro- tections enabled the lodges to serve indirectly as a counter to  the state. Ritualized spaces of non-familial, non-market rela- tions,  the  lodges  provided  forms  of  association  and  experi- ences of connection beyond those established by absolutism.  They established their own standards and habits of judgment.  Koselleck  emphasizes  that  this  new  form  of  social  pressure,  this  new  moral  force  that  had  to  forgo  direct  coercion,  “was  always  simultaneously  an  act  of  passing  more  judgment  on  the State.”55 Because the lodges distinguished themselves from  the  state,  because  they  positioned  themselves  as  avowedly  moral and non-political, they set themselves not simply apart  from politics, but above it, in a new domain they were usher- ing into being. Refusing to acknowledge their actions as politi- cal, they subjected the state instead to their moralizing gaze.56  They were political actors who denied their politics.  Kelty’s  geeks  function  analogously  to  Koselleck’s  lodges.  Both are groups that treat their own norms and practices as  those  to  which  society  as  a  whole  is  or  should  be  subjected  even  as  they  deny  their  political  investments.  Kelty  presents  “geeks” as outside government and industry even as they work  within  them,  as  outside  of  politics  even  as  they  endeavor  to  serve  and  enhance  capitalism.  He  identifies  their  work  with   a moral idea of order associated both with The Public  capital- ization  in  original   and  with  specific  norms  of  “availability,   C2  DBG_01.indd   25  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   26  Blog	Settings  reusability, and modifiability.”57 These norms thereby emerge  as  seemingly  neutral  and  unquestionably  appropriate  stan- dards  for  societal  judgment.  Moreover,  as  in  Habermas’s  initial  account  of  the  bourgeois  public  sphere,  which  disap- pears at the moments of its materialization in mass commu- nication as the critical role of the idealized public is displaced  by the consumerist orientation of the public, so in Kelty’s does  the “recursive public” recede in the wake of the mass uptake  of computer-mediated communication. Geek norms emerge,  claim neutrality and appropriateness, and then retreat, leaving  in their wake a pro-capitalist, entrepreneurial, and individual- istic discourse of evaluation well suited for the extension and  amplification  of  neoliberal  governmentality.  Differently  put,  the  “recursive  public”  appears  only  retroactively,  in  Kelty’s  idealization of the libertarian technical impulse that celebrates  exercises in expanding and intensifying privately owned plat- forms and applications as democracy.  6  Turner’s New Communalists and Kelty’s Free Software func- tion as “displaced mediators.” I offer the term ‘displaced medi- ator’ as an upgrade of the notion of the “vanishing mediator,”  introduced  by  Fredric  Jameson  and  elaborated  further  by  Žižek.  For  Jameson  and  Žižek,  the  vanishing  mediator  is  a  transitional  figure  –  of  an  institution,  practice,  idea  –  that  accounts for a fundamental change. The vanishing mediator  triggers a process of change even as change quickly overtakes  it. Jameson refers to the Protestant work ethic as the vanishing  mediator between feudalism and capitalism and to the Jacobins  as the vanishing mediator between the political structures of  absolutism  and  bourgeois  rule.  Each  serves  as  a  “catalytic  agent  which  permits  an  exchange  of  energies  between  two  otherwise  mutually  exclusive  terms.”58  Žižek  uses  the  East  European  transition  to  capitalism  to  make  the  same  point.  During  the  months  of  socialist  upheaval,  a  chaotic  array  of  punks, artists, and activists flourished in a heady mix of demo- cratic activity. Once the new regime established itself, once it   C2  DBG_01.indd   26  4 9 2010   1:36:07 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  27  adopted  the  language  of  democracy  as  its  own,  these  same  movements either vanished or began to stand for their oppo- site,  “protocommunists.”59  Again,  the  logic  is  one  wherein  what was previously an external presupposition  an opposing  force, say  comes to be posited as an inherent moment, thereby  obliterating the prior open and antagonistic condition.  Given that the mediators Jameson and Žižek describe don’t  vanish but remain present in a different form, whether ideally,  oppositionally, or as practices and aspirations the pressure of  which we continue to feel, I think of them as displaced media- tors. After all, there are still Protestants. There are still work  ethics. The Jacobins’ ideals of equality, freedom, and solidarity  continue to exert a kind of signifying stress  a term from Eric  Santner   on  our  failures  to  have  realized  them.  And  East  European  activists  and  artists  continue  to  struggle  against  nationalism, capitalism, and democracy as the political form  both have taken. To refer to these mediators as “vanishing,”  then,  suggests  a  victory  in  situations  in  which  contestation  continues. Rather than participating in this disappearance, the  term “displaced mediator” designates mediators whose func- tions have been displaced from what appears  retroactively  as  their previous role.  The New Communalists, then, are displaced mediators in  the  sense  that  they  turned  the  practices  and  suppositions  of  the  military–corporate  research  complex  into  the  ideals  and  suppositions  of  a  counterculture.  The  “recursive  public”  of  Free Software claims to incorporate and extend ideals of flex- ibility, changeability, and reprogrammability. Yet the networks  of  communicative  capitalism  at  the  basis  of  Free  Software  instead  produce  inequality,  insecurity,  and  subjection  to  the  conditions and demands of a recalcitrant finance sector. What  proferred  itself  as  a  vehicle  for  bringing  in  something  new,  something better, becomes the mechanism for further embed- ding and extending the old, now strengthened by the rhetoric  of its own over-coming.  The  term  “displaced  mediator”  indexes  displacement  in  multiple registers. Here are three. First, along with the politi- cal-economic change effected though the mediators as human  groups, media themselves may be displaced by the events and   C2  DBG_01.indd   27  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   28  Blog	Settings  developments they enable. For example, mainframe comput- ers  stimulated  cooperative  time-sharing  practices  that  valo- rized the ideals of collaboration and adaptation necessary for  advances in personal and networked computing. Such super- computers are still functioning, but their place in the comput- ing  imaginary  has  shifted.  Although  they  are  current,  they  seem like relics.  Second, emphases on specific media and technologies risk  displacing attention from their settings. Here, media stand in  for  sometimes occluding  larger, more systemic political and  economic  changes.  Widespread  uptake  in  participation  on  a  commercial  social  network  like  Facebook  or  MySpace  may  displace   as  well  as  supplement  or  enhance   other  practices  and  activities  –  pick-up  basketball  or  going  door  to  door  to  collect signatures for a campaign, say – practices and activities  that then come to be viewed themselves in media terms. So,  texting  enables  kids  to  arrange  basketball  games  or  online  petitions make signature gathering faster and easier. What’s  displaced from view are the pleasures and benefits accompany- ing the prior mode of being. More fundamentally, enthusiasm  over new gadgets and apps, communicative sites and practices  –  like  Twitter,  Facebook,  and  blogging  –  displaces  critical  attention from their setting in communicative capitalism.  Third,  the  history  of  networked  communications  is  filled  with displaced mediators: semaphores, telegraphs, CB radios,  records,  eight-track  tape,  videotape,  landlines,  pagers,  BBSs,  usenet, alternet, homepages, portal sites – not to mention film,  television, mobile phones, and the internet. Over a decade ago,  Bruce  Sterling  put  together  a  web-based  project  to  archive  “dead” and obsolete media.60 To consider such media as dis- placed is to consider them in and as settings, in and as imbri- cated in political, economic, and affective circuits. The concept  of  displaced  media,  then,  is  a  critical  one.  Media  appear  as  displaced from the perspective of a backward look. Their dis- placement  is  retroactively  determined  in  the  context  of  an  attempt to pull an explanation out of the multiplicity and con- tingency of technological change. Thus, a benefit of “displaced  media”  is  that  it  yields  “newness”  in  advance.  Rather  than  linking critical media theory to its currency – has it kept up   C2  DBG_01.indd   28  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  29  and  incorporated  the  latest  techno-trends?  –  the  idea  of  dis- placed  media  embeds  the  instability  and  volatility  of  media  practices into the analysis.  7  Blogging emerges as a practice in communicative capitalism.  Not  only  are  blogs  “natively  digital,”  but  the  practices  of  posting, linking, commenting, reacting, measuring, and circu- lating make mediated reflexivity available to virtually anyone  who wants to bother. Even if a blog post is more than a reac- tion, more than a commentary on something else, its invita- tion to read, comment, and share installs it in communicative  capitalism’s  flows  of  information  and  entertainment.  Blogging’s settings, then, include the decline of symbolic effi- ciency,  the  recursive  loops  of  universalized  reflexivity,  the  extreme inequalities that reflexive networks produce, and the  operation of displaced mediators at points of critical transition.  Its default mode is captured.  Rather than treating blogs as cutting-edge forms of partici- patory journalism or new experiments in an already mundane  exhibitionism,  I  proceed  from  the  assumption  that  they  are  displaced mediators. Even if they’re not dead yet, their role in  inciting practices of online disclosure, discussion, and surveil- lance has both already been displaced by other Web 2.0 plat- forms  such  as  social  networks  and  video-sharing  and  itself  displaced attention from the profound inequalities produced  and amplified by global financial and entertainment networks.  Differently put, as displaced mediators, blogs access key fea- tures  of  communicative  capitalism:  the  intensification  of  mediality  in  reflexive  networks   communicating  about  com- municating , the emergence of “whatever beings”  beings who  belong but not to anything in particular , and the circulation  of affect  as networks generate and amplify spectacular effects .  This access not only draws out the challenges to political orga- nization  under  current  conditions  but  also  highlights  the  imperative  for  actually  undertaking  such  organizing  rather  than  presuming  it  will  simply  emerge:  the  very  practices  of   C2  DBG_01.indd   29  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   30  Blog	Settings  media  we  enjoy,  the  practices  that  connect  us  to  others  and  ostensibly end our alienation, appropriate and reassemble our  longings into new forms of exploitation and control.  Key to the argument of this book is the claim that Lacan’s  version  of  the  psychoanalytic  concept  of  drive  expresses  the  reflexive structure of complex networks. For Lacan, the drive  is “beyond the instinct to return to the state of equilibrium.”61  Its very excess renders it akin to a “will to create from zero, a  will to begin again.”62 Lacan’s description here evokes the self- organized  criticality  of  complex  networks.  Accelerations  and  repetitions throughout their circuits gain in momentum and  intensity  –  feeding  frenzies,  vicious  circles,  bubbles  –  until  they  result  in  extreme  or  catastrophic  ruptures,  zero  points  from which something new begins.  The  repercussion  of  this  claim  is  that  what  idealists  from  the Enlightenment, through critical and democratic theory, to  contemporary  techno-utopians  theorize  as  the  very  form  of  freedom is actually a mechanism for the generation of extreme  inequality  and  capture.  Just  as  enthusiasts  for  emergence,  anarchy, and Free Software presume in advance the progres- sive radicality of being beyond law, governance, and the state,  so have some psychoanalytically inspired theorists too quickly  presumed that liberation can be found beyond desire and the  law.  I  argue  that  beyond  the  law  are  the  reflexive  circuits  of  drive.  Communicative  capitalism  thrives  not  because  of  unceasing  or  insatiable  desires  but  in  and  as  the  repetitive  intensity of drive.  Lacan conceives drive as necessarily death drive  rather than  agreeing with Freud’s view of eros as also a drive . This death  drive  ruptures  equilibrium.  Such  an  explicit  negativity  can  interrupt  and  counter  the  slide  from  networked  computers  into  networks  as  biological  swarms  and  patterns.  Although  typically associated in the theoretical literature with biopolitics  or  biopower,  the  elision  from  biological  metaphor  to  net- worked  communication  appears  throughout  popular  techno- utopianism,  particularly  that  techno-utopianism  blending  neoliberalism  free  markets,  anti-  regulation  and the internet. I see this rather unexpected union  of computers and bios as symptomatic of a new essentialism:    entrepreneurialism,   C2  DBG_01.indd   30  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Blog	Settings  31  network  logics  are  dictates  of  nature,  a  new  form  of  natural  law that immanently and necessarily yields the unity and con- vergence of all things to the extent that they are allowed to flow  freely. Just like the spread of lily-pads in a pond, the analogy  goes,  so  will  blogs  and  other  innovations  emerge  and  die,  flourish and struggle. Absorbed in a supposition of immanent  reconciliation, extremes of distribution become natural facts,  outgrowths of abundant potential. The notion of drive coun- ters this immanent naturalism by highlighting the inhuman  at the heart of the human, the cut or break with the flow of  life,  the  peculiar  and  uncanny  human  propensity  to  become  stuck on minor activities and minimal differences. Conceived  in terms of drive, networked communications circulate less as  potentials  for  freedom  than  as  the  affective  intensities  pro- duced through and amplifying our capture.  My discussion of drive draws heavily from Žižek, but there  is a difference. Žižek emphasizes that the “stuckness” of drive   what I’ve been treating as capture  is the intrusion of radical  break  or  imbalance:  “drive  is  quite  literally  the  very  ‘drive’  to  break the All of continuity in which we are embedded, to introduce  a radical imbalance into it.”63 My argument is that communi- cative capitalism is a formation that relies on this imbalance,  on the repeated suspension of narratives, patterns, identities,  norms, etc. Under conditions of the decline of symbolic effi- ciency, drive is not an act. It does not break out of a set of given  expectations because such sets no longer persist as coherent  enchainments of meaning. On the contrary, the circulation of  drive is functional for the prevention of such enchainments,  enchainments that might well enable radical political opposi- tion. The contemporary challenge, then, is producing the con- ditions of possibility for breaking out of or redirecting the loop  of drive.  One of the stranger aspects of communicative capitalism is  new  media  activists’  faith  in  the  ideologies  of  networks  and  publicity.  Activists  continue  to  emphasize  the  democratic  potential of the internet, even in the face of the increases in  economic inequality and consolidation of neoliberal capitalism  in and through globally networked communication. They con- tinue to embrace the notion of a value added in networks as   C2  DBG_01.indd   31  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   32  Blog	Settings  if through a magical process of accrual, a magic of networks  that  would  transform  politics  just  as  it  transformed  the  economy into something else. The only reason for accepting  this magical thinking is if one thinks that there is no politics  other  than  the  market,  if  one  assumes,  in  other  words,  that  the market has not only displaced but taken the place of the  political. Differently put, such a lack or absence of the political  is  the  hole  around  which  networked  communications  circu- late.  Or,  more  precisely,  this  loss  of  a  capacity  to  think  the  political circulates as drive.  To return back to where I started, my wager is for critical  media  theory   in  book  form .  And  the  wager  is  that  critical  media theory is possible when it occupies the trap of its emer- gence,  not  when  it  offers  happy  solutions   the  happiness  of  which would necessarily belie the severity of the problems it  diagnoses   and  not  when  it  presumes  that  an  analysis  of  entrapment  or  capture  is  the  same  thing  as  escape   which  would presuppose that the trap was a pseudo trap of words all  along . In the reflexive networks of communicative capitalism,  a  media  theory  that  is  critical  has  to  foreswear  the  affective  enterprise  of  contributing  the  feeling-impulses  of  hope  and  reassurance and offer thinking instead.  C2  DBG_01.indd   32  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   2	 The	Death	of	Blogging  1  A sure sign of the triumph of a practice or idea is the declara- tion of its death. Early in the summer of 2007, the bell tolled  for blogging – despite the fact that the number of blogs had  exceeded  seventy  million  and  was  continuing  to  rise.  Throughout  the  ostensibly  dead  blogosphere,  word  spread  rapidly  that  blogs  had  been  killed  by  boredom,  success,  and  even newer media  a weird contradiction whereby the content  of  the  news  was  belied  by  the  form  of  its  blogged  announcement .  For some the newness had worn off. Having blogged, they  were ready for something else. Some blog writers tired of the  demands  of  the  format  for  regular  updates;  “they  said  what  they had to say and moved on.”1 Some blog readers lost interest  in the daily activities of so-called “A-listers.” Familiar with the  voices and perspectives of widely popular long-term bloggers,  they began turning their attention elsewhere, to making videos  for YouTube or lolcats for “I Can Has Cheezburger.” Others  lamented the repetitiveness of blog debates. After a few months  of  reading  a  given  blog  or  frequenting  a  set  of  sites  in  the  blogipelago,2  predicting  the  range  of  responses  to  any  given  post or comment was easy. In the words of a blogger quoted  in an Australian newspaper, “The same old people saying the  same old things. Boring. Boring. Boring.”3 Wasn’t the increas- ing  number  of  abandoned  blogs,  of  ghost  blogs  with  one  or  two  posts  left  behind  by  those  who  tried  blogging  and  then  realized  they  had  better  ways  to  spend  their  time,  clear  evi- dence that blogging was dying as a practice?  C2  33  DBG_02.indd   33  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   34  The	Death	of	Blogging  No. Accompanying the apparently rising rates of blog death  was a phenomenon indicative of blogging’s vitality even as it  was a culpable suspect in the death of blogging – the rise of  corporate  blogs.  Well  before  the  summer  of  2007,  blogs  seemed to have reached a saturation point. Corporations had  begun to monitor, intervene in, and attempt to produce con- versations. As the Brand Republic website urged, “By getting  involved in user-generated content, you can get more people  involved  in  your  brand  than  they  have  ever  been  before,  increase their loyalty, even make them your brand advocates.  And  you  can  find  out  exactly  what  they  think  about  your  product.”4 Blogs provided access to information about custom- ers’  likes  and  dislikes,  trends  and  buzz  previously  available  only in the survey snapshots of pollsters. By starting their own  blogs, hiring bloggers, and participating in discussions related  to their products, companies could market in another mode.  They  could  tap  niches  and  build  brand  awareness  through  more  direct  interactions  with  potential  customers  –  even  as  they faced the problem of attracting readers to their blogs, of  promoting their promotions, or advertising their advertising.5  By  2009,  70  percent  of  bloggers  said  they  blogged  about  brands.6  With  brand  attachment  as  a  primary  goal,  corporate  blog- ging came up against a key element of blogging: the conceit  of authenticity. How could a blog ostensibly written by a logo  or branded media image or even an actual person paid to blog  by the company offer anything but spin? What would be the  attraction of a blog that was all advertising? Why would anyone  visit that? In 2006, for example, bloggers outed McDonald’s  for foisting a fake blog on unsuspecting viewers in ads for the  Super Bowl.7 Even worse were the computer-generated spam- blogs  or  splogs.8  Spamblogs  scrape  and  grab  content  from  anywhere on the internet and dump it on a blog that has been  automatically  generated.  This  content  then  shows  up  higher  in search-engine results since it appears that more people are  linking to it. When one searches the content and follows the  link, one ends up at site with a bunch of ads and thus contrib- utes to the site-owner’s ad revenue. In December 2006, splogs  were being created at the rate of about eleven thousand a day.9   C2  DBG_02.indd   34  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  35  Combined  with  the  generally  recognized  banality  of  most  blogs,  the  proliferation  of  blog  trash  suggested  a  technology  and a practice that had exceeded its use-by date.  As blogging apparently suffocated under the excesses of its  own  success,  new  applications  appeared  to  take  its  place  or,  better, join it in an ever-intensifying expansion of media appli- cations and practices. Some commentators viewed these new  applications as more nails in blogging’s coffin. Blogging was  good while it lasted, but it was no longer fresh. It wasn’t politi- cally  bold  or  culturally  innovative,  but  rather  the  way  one’s  aunt displayed her cat photos. New applications seemed to be  changing the conditions of possibility for blogging. With the  addition of podcasting, photoblogging, and videoblogging, the  platform had been stretched as far as it could go.  The most frequently invoked blog killers were large social  networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, but microblog- ging practices like Twitter  a merging of SMS – Short Message  Service or texting – and the internet created in 2006  were not  far behind. Facebook and MySpace reconfigure the link, post,  comment, and archive structure associated with blogs. Rather  than oriented around daily or even weekly posts on a regular  set  of  themes  or  from  a  particular  perspective,  these  large  social  network  sites  rely  on  brief,  frequent  updates  to  user  profiles, lots of photos, and ever-growing lists of friends. Blog  updates can be syndicated into one’s profile and links can be  shared  with  one’s  friends,  but  unlike  blogs’  reliance  on  the  persona of the blogger, social network sites prioritize connec- tions  to  others  –  whoever  and  whatever  the  others  might  be   bands,  groups,  and  products  are  all  available  as  potential  “friends” on MySpace . Contacts matter more than informa- tion, angle, or opinion. Social network sites let one see one’s  connections,  the  others  who  are  more  than  an  audience  of  readers,  the  colleagues  and  family  members  and  friends  of  friends that constitute the communities that traverse specific  locations. Able quickly and easily to update one’s “friends” on  what one is doing, one doesn’t have to spend a great deal of  time involved with specific, individual, people. It’s like friend- ship lite or friendship without friendship  in other words, it’s  in  the  overall  series  of  objects  or  practices  deprived  of  their   C2  DBG_02.indd   35  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   36  The	Death	of	Blogging  harmful features that Slavoj Žižek associates with contempo- rary  culture:  beer  without  alcohol,  sugar-free  candy,  coffee  without caffeine, etc. . Even better: social network sites let us  see  ourselves  being  seen.  Instead  of  writing  for  strangers,  a  characteristic  of  blogs  insofar  as  they  are  available  to  search  engines,  social  network  sites  privilege  sharing  with  friends,  with a circuit of others that one has explicitly “friended.”  Like  Facebook  and  MySpace,  Twitter  also  relies  on  social  networks and short entries. Mobile users text entries – “tweets”  – of 140 characters or fewer as they go about their days, updat- ing their “followers” on where they are, what they are doing,  and  what  they  think  or  feel  at  any  given  moment.  It’s  like  blogging stripped to its most banal, repetitive, and nonetheless  connective and intimate features. A benefit over blogs is brevity  – one can keep up without having to spend much time doing  it – and mobility – one can post and receive updates via mobile  phone so one can always be connected.  More significant is the performance of authenticity enabled  by  Twitter  –  along  with  Facebook’s  newsfeed  and  the  mood  updates on MySpace: the short glimpses into someone’s life  as it is being lived seem real.10 They seem real in part because  they are only glimpses, fragments, and indications rather than  fully formed and composed reflections and in part because we  witness them being seen by others.  Obscuring the larger setting of communicative capitalism,  the declaration that blogs are dead hinders our thinking about  contemporary media practices and their additive, supplemen- tary, interlinking dimensions. Social network sites and Twitter  don’t replace blogs; they traverse, extend, and include them.  According  to  the  2009  State  of  the  Blogosphere  report,  73  percent of bloggers v. 14 percent of the general population use  Twitter – the percentage use among professional bloggers is  even higher; all bloggers say their number one use of Twitter  is promoting their blogs.11 Ignoring the intermediation of con- temporary  communicative  practices,  the  proclamation  that  blogs are dead repeats the criticisms of blogging that accom- panied its emergence: blogging is parasitic, narcissistic, point- less. Since these criticisms neither prevented the rapid uptake  of blogging nor actually cohere insofar as the accusations of   C2  DBG_02.indd   36  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  37  parasitism and narcissism presume a point to blogging even  as they wrongly reduce blogs to either commentaries on other  media or accounts of people’s everyday experiences, they are  better understood as descriptions. Blogging is parasitic, narcis- sistic, and pointless – and this is why internet users all over the  world blog in ever-increasing numbers.  The  evidence  offered  for  the  death  of  blogs  points  to   blogging’s  life  even  as  it  indexes  ongoing  turbulence  –   innovation  and  obsolescence  –  in  media  practices.  As  one  blogger noted,  hardly  a  day  goes  by  without  some  intellectual  or  journalist  or  other  member  of  the  only-our-opinion-counts  brigade  writing  something about how awful, stupid, passé, dumb, rude, uninter- esting or otherwise unacceptable blogs are. My unwanted advice  to such writers is that if blogs really are as uncaptivating as you  keep  saying,  and  are  as  rapidly  on  their  way  to  oblivion  as  you  keep breathlessly announcing, then stop writing about them.12  Critical media theory easily risks the same mistake, proceed- ing  as  if  networked  media  practices  necessarily  contain  or  accompany  a  guerilla  politics  of  minoritarian  disruption   “hacktivism”  rather than emerge and persist as components  of a vast commercial entertainment culture that has found a  way to get the users to make the products they enjoy and even  pay to do it.  Just  as  the  newness  wore  off  for  some  English-language  early adopters, millions more across the globe were taking up  blogging.13 Some of the most significant growth is in Asia: over  61 percent of Chinese internet users have created blogs  com- pared  to  18  percent  in  the  UK,  21  percent  in  the  US,  and  8  percent in Germany  and over 80 percent of internet users in  China, South Korea, and Malaysia have read blogs.14 In 2006  there were more blog posts per hour in Japanese than there  were in English.15 That there was no longer an “A-list” of elite  bloggers   nearly  always  centered  in  and  on  the  US   didn’t  mean  blogging  was  dead  –  it  meant  that  more  people  were  blogging,  that  there  were  more  blogs  to  read,  and  that  the  blogipelago was growing, expanding, diversifying. It meant, in   C2  DBG_02.indd   37  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   38  The	Death	of	Blogging  other words, that blogging had become an active component  of contemporary media’s circuits.  To accentuate the diversity among blogs, the way that blog- gers do not constitute some kind of natural group, understand  themselves as a collective, or interact in a common space, not  least because of differences in language, culture, location, and  interest, I favor the term “blogipelago” over the more common  “blogosphere.” The term “sphere” suggests a space accessible  to any and all. It implies a kind of conversational unity, as if  bloggers  addressed  the  same  topics  and  participated  in  one  giant discussion. The term “blogosphere” tricks us into think- ing community when we should be asking about the kinds of  links, networks, flows, and solidarities that blogs hinder and  encourage. “Blogipelago,” like archipelago, reminds us of sep- arateness, disconnection, and the immense effort it can take  to move from one island or network to another. It incites us  to attend to the variety of uses, engagements, performances,  and intensities blogging contributes and circulates.  Corporate uptake of blogging, while a nuisance to long-time  bloggers, is a market version of the expansion and diversifica- tion  of  blogs.  While  apparent  in  companies’  enthusiasm  for  identifying  ever  more  specific  niche  tastes  and  markets,  the  drive to monetize work and content seemingly offered free of  charge  accelerates  blogging’s  centripetal  momentum.  Far  from  inaugurating  a  new  creative,  post-monetary  commons,  media  practices  like  blogging  and  social  networks  ease  the  paths of neoliberal capitalism. Why should employers pay for  work that we happily do for free?  Blogging lives. Rather than “the lingering remainders of a  cultish enthusiasm for self-expression that is rapidly wearing  off,”  the  new  technological  forms  and  practices  emerging  around and from blogging indicate the spread and morphing  of drives to connect and express.16 My concern here is to theo- rize critically the widespread uptake of blogging as a practice  that emerges in a rapidly changing communications environ- ment. Blogging is a way to access the current conjuncture of  media, subjectivity, and politics, a conjuncture that I argue is  best understood via the reflexive circuit of drive.  C2  DBG_02.indd   38  4 9 2010   1:36:08 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  39  2  Blogging  has  been  associated  with  murder  and  death  ever  since  the  mainstream  media  starting  noticing  it   around  2002 . Just like video killed the radio star, film killed vaude- ville, and television killed bowling leagues, so did blogs alleg- edly  kill  journalism  and  mainstream  media,  replacing  these  with idiots and amateurs who failed to check their facts and  ranted about their pet issues  as well as issues with their pets .  There’s a constant underlying all this killing – corporate power.  Even as some media forms eclipse others, global conglomer- ates profit from the innovations and pernicious arrangements  of  state  power  benefit  from  a  diverted  populace.  Television  can’t deliver the requisite eyeballs? No problem. Switch gears,  locate other sites to capitalize. The dominance of capitalism as  a system requires changes in industry; innovation drives capi- talism.  State  forms  adapt  as  well:  disintegrated  spectacles  allow for ever more advanced forms of monitoring, tracking,  and  surveillance.17  People  plead  for  more  cameras  to  keep  them safe as they shop and happily relinquish personal data  in exchange for saving a few cents here or there, for shaving  seconds off this site or that.  The  opposition  of  the  death  of  the  old  and  vitality  of  the  new, as well as the concomitant cries to condemn the old ways  and celebrate the new, is a recurrent theme in technology and  media writing that tells us nothing about the technologies and  media practices involved. Inserting new actors into old series,  the  opposition  between  old  and  new  obscures  the  practices  and settings of technologies, the ways technologies are used   ways that are often diverse, conflicting, and unexpected , and  the  ways  these  uses  produce  different  sorts  of  subjects.  For  example, in the 1970s access to and knowledge of computing  put one in an elite class of scientists and engineers. By the end  of the 1980s, computer literacy was considered a core skill or  competence. In the twenty-first century, spending time online  is  suspected  to  be  as  much  of  a  time-waster  as  watching  television.  C2  DBG_02.indd   39  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   40  The	Death	of	Blogging  Blogging’s obituary, though, is not just premature. It’s not  just  an  error.  Rather  it  alerts  us  to  a  change  in  a  practice,  a  change  that  appears  as  an  effect  of  our  looking  back.  When  bloggers  are  killers  ushering  in  fundamental  changes  in  media, politics, and journalism, they are understood within a  logic of desire. That is, there is an underlying supposition that  at some point in time some people wanted blogs, that blogs  were  objects  of  desire  produced  to  fill  a  previous  lack.  For  example,  people  didn’t  trust  the  mainstream  media,  so  they  starting blogging in order to produce a journalism they could  trust. The shift to death rhetoric marks a move away from this  economy of desire and toward one of drive. When blogs are  situated in a logic of drive, they aren’t something we want but  lack,  aren’t  something  introduced  into  a  lack  that  they  can’t  fill. They are objects difficult to avoid, elements of an inescap- able circuit in which we are caught, compelled, driven.18  In Lacanian psychoanalysis, desire and drive each designate  a way that the subject relates to enjoyment. Desire is always a  desire to desire, a desire that can never be filled, a desire for  a jouissance that can never be attained. In contrast, drive attains  jouissance in the repetitive process of not reaching it. Failure   or the thwarting of the aim  provides its own sort of success.  If desire is like the path of an arrow, drive is like the course  of  the  boomerang.  What  is  fundamental  at  the  level  of  the  drive, Lacan teaches, is “the movement outwards and back in  which  it  is  structured.”19  Through  this  repetitive  movement  outward  and  back  the  subject  can  miss  its  object  but  still  achieve its aim; the subject can “find satisfaction in the very  circular movement of repeatedly missing its object.”20 Because  failure  produces  enjoyment,  because  the  subject  enjoys  via  repetition, drive captures the subject. Slavoj Žižek writes,”drive  is something in which the subject is caught, a kind of acepha- lous  force  which  persists  in  its  repetitive  movement.”21  The  subject gets stuck doing the same thing over and over again  because  this  doing  produces  enjoyment.  Post.  Post.  Post.  Click. Click. Click.  Although  Freud’s  thinking  about  drive  changed  over  the  course of his research, his view is typically rendered in terms  of  two  drives,  eros  and  thanatos,  life  and  death,  connection   C2  DBG_02.indd   40  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  41  and  separation.  Lacan  rejects  this  dichotomy,  arguing  that  drive as such is death drive. Rather than involving some kind  of primary homeostasis or equilibrium, drives are a destabiliz- ing force, a force that persists, that exerts a pressure, without  regard  for  the  pleasure  and  well-being  of  the  subject.  As  a  persistence that is not for the sake of the subject, drive, then,  has almost an undead quality. It is excessive, persisting beyond  the  ostensibly  natural  contours  of  life  and  death.  In  the  Lacanian view, drive as death drive encompasses the way that  even  a  drive  for  life  results  in  paradoxes  wherein  saving  life  entails sacrificing it, pursuing life leads to risking it, and cher- ishing life looks like a bizarre fixation on morbidity. Turning  back in on itself, turning into its opposite, the death drive is  reflexive.  3  Blogs  emerge  out  of  the  internet  environment  of  the  late  1990s, but not, as Geert Lovink points out, as the result of “a  movement or event.”22 They are more like “a special effect of  software.” Blogs are retroactive effects of networked practices  of  storing  and  linking.  In  the  words  of  the  Digital  Methods  Initiative,  they  are  “natively  digital”  and  in  this  way  kin  to  threads, tags, links, and search engines. They’ve also spawned  their own natively digital offspring, most specifically the post  as the primary unit designating a contribution  as opposed to  the page, a key unit for print culture that makes little sense in  a digital environment .23  Blogging’s kinship with search engines is particularly close:  the first blogs were responding to the same problems that led  to  the  development  of  search  engines  –  how  can  one  find  something in particular on the internet?24 Already in the late  nineties the internet was imbued with a fantasy of abundance.25  Anything was possible. One could connect to anyone, say any- thing, find everything. The truth was out there. Locating some- thing specific, though, was another question altogether. There  seemed to be too much noise, too much chaos. Finding useful,  not to mention reliable, information was a challenge.  C2  DBG_02.indd   41  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   42  The	Death	of	Blogging  The first blogs  twenty-three counted in 1999  were logs of  websites, signposts left by a previous navigator to those who  might want to follow his path, trace her links.26 The compiler  of the list, or blogger, presented links to sites or articles she  found particularly noteworthy. What made the list most helpful  was the blogger’s commentary, the description of the site or  explanation as to why a given link was included. Commentary  was  the  valued-added,  the  new  content  that  made  the  blog  itself worth visiting. The commentary let blog readers – those  looking for reliable guides as they made their way through the  web – know whether they could trust the blogger. One shouldn’t  forget,  though,  that  the  first  blogs  were  only  first  later,  after  bloggers were blogging.  Blogs and search engines emerged in the place of a missing  “subject supposed to know”  a concept from Lacanian psycho- analysis .27 Early searchers trying to make their way through  the noise to find what they were looking for had to presuppose  not  only  that  what  they  wanted  was  out  there   a  promise  of  abundance  but that they could find it  a promise of access .  Given  the  way  abundance  –  everything  was  out  there  –  made  searching infinitely time-consuming, one needed help – sign- posts,  indexes,  catalogues,  portals,  editors,  search  engines.  Before Google there were multiple projects and paths attempt- ing to provide this help. Blogs and search engines are two such  projects, two fillings-in of the place that emerged for a subject  supposed to know.  What  was  the  subject  supposed  to  know  supposed  to   know?  Not  just  how  to  find  information,  but  the  truth  of   the  searcher’s  desire.  That  is  to  say,  those  searching  on   the  internet  might  not  know  what  they  actually  want.  They  might  call  it  one  thing,  but  mean  another.  They  might  not  know  what  they  mean,  not  be  able  to  put  their  desire  into  words. Search engines and blogs were established to occupy a  place for the knower of our secrets, our desires, a place for one  who would know what we wanted when we didn’t really know  ourselves.  This supposition of a subject supposed to know is manifest  in  several  different  ways.  One  is  hysterical.  Faced  with  poor  returns from a search query, the searcher responds with frus-  C2  DBG_02.indd   42  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  43  tration, No! That’s not it! There must be something else, something  more,  something  better.  Another  response  is  paranoid.  There  must be something or someone behind the scenes, collecting  the data, distorting the results. Someone is watching, collecting.  Someone or something is looking for me. The paranoid response,  then, exposes a tension: one wants knowledge to be available,  but  one  doesn’t  want  to  be  known.  One’s  expectations  are  structured through a fantasy of abundance – the truth is out  there – while at the same time one wants to withhold an aspect  of oneself; the whole truth is not out there; my truth, the truth  of  my  desire,  remains  withheld.  There  is  even  a  perverse  response that, again, demonstrates the underlying supposition  of a subject supposed to know. The pervert positions himself  as the instrument or guarantor of knowledge, the one who can  deal with contingency, who can build a better search engine,  come  up  with  a  completely  reliable  algorithm,  serve  as  the  vehicle for realizing the fantasy of abundance.  Blogs  and  search  engines  are  different  approaches  to  the  same problem, different occupations of the same place. They  point, though, in different directions. Faced with the challenge  of  providing  a  trusted  guide  through  a  chaotic,  indetermin- able, changing field, search engines say “trust the algorithm.”  In contrast, blogs say, “trust doesn’t scale.” So while the former  offers a reliability based in equations and crawl capacities, the  latter says, know the knower. It focuses on the person provid- ing the link, offering the searcher the opportunity to know this  person and so determine whether she can be trusted. Social  network sites refract the problem of trust yet again: if the issue  with blogs is the credibility of the guide or writer, the issue for  social network sites is trust in the audience, in the others who  might be following me.  Of course, this description is too simple: like search engines,  blogs are a technological application. For many commentators,  the capabilities enabled by this application establish the defini- tion of a blog: a collection of posts  each with its own perma- link , appearing in reverse chronological order, time-stamped,  and  archived.  Posts  can  be  texts,  images,  audio,  and  video.  They may feature links to other blogs and sites on the internet.  They may offer visitors opportunities to comment.  C2  DBG_02.indd   43  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   44  The	Death	of	Blogging  In  her  brief  2002  introduction  to  blogs,  Meg  Hourihan  observes how “newness” attaches readers to blogs. Because the  newest  posts  appear  first,  readers  can  easily  keep  up-to-the- minute  track  of  what’s  blogged.  They  don’t  have  to  search  through a site looking for the most current information. It’s  right in front them, likely provided by an RSS feed or news- reader. This immediacy helps tie readers to a site as they follow  developments in real time. Even more significant than imme- diacy for attaching readers to blogs are those features of the  blog format that contribute to cross-blog connections and con- versations.  Thus  Hourihan  emphasizes  the  time  stamp  and  the permalink as aspects of the blog format conducive to con- nectivity. “The linking that happens through blogging creates  the connections that bind us,” she writes. “Commentary alone  is  the  province  of  journals,  diaries,  and  editorial  pieces.”28  Trust is more than code and reliability is more than expertise  and credentialing. Blogging responds to the problem of finding  what  one  wants  by  offering  something  like  a  relationship,  a  connection.  4  What is a blog, anyway? danah boyd criticizes the metaphors  on which early answers to the question relied.29 Not only does  she point out the interests technology companies had in defin- ing  blogging,  interests  linked  to  efforts  to  build  and  market  their product as well as set standards and expectations for what  blogs  would  be  and  how  they  would  function,  but  she  also  rightly  attends  to  the  role  of  early  researchers  who  treated  blogging in terms of genre. The most prominent metaphors  in these early attempts to define blogging were journals and  journalism.30  Some researchers followed the lead of hosting services such  as  LiveJournal  in  viewing  blogs  as  personal  diaries  or  easily  updatable  journals.  This  diary  metaphor  creates  a  problem,  though.  What’s  appealing  about  networked  personal  diaries  electronically  available  for  anyone  to  read?  Why  would  any  person whatsoever want to read anyone else’s boring journal?   C2  DBG_02.indd   44  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  45  And  if  the  journal  isn’t  boring,  what  sort  of  exhibitionistic  narcissist would inflict it on the entire world? Understood in  terms of personal diaries, blogs seem but another aspect of the  reality television craze, part of entertainment culture’s preoc- cupation with celebrity.  Other researchers agreed with the mainstream media and  depicted blogs as new forms of citizen journalism.31 Whether  they treat blogs as vehicles for local and on-the-ground report- ing or as sites for the expression of individual opinions, these  attempts to define blogs in terms of journalism open up a host  of difficulties. The most apparent has been the failure of the  vast majority of blogs to live up to the journalistic standards  established  for  them.  Bloggers  generally  lack  the  ethics  and  skills associated with professional journalism. Few do new and  original  reporting  but  instead  remediate  the  findings  of  real  journalists  as  they  mix  into  them  their  own  strident,  often  vicious,  points  of  view.  Approached  as  a  genre,  then,  blogs  turn out to be rather pathetic, at least from the perspective of  the mainstream media.32  Together,  the  two  metaphors  of  journal  and  journalism  configure the practice of blogging in terms of a private and a  public  sphere,  failing  to  analyze  or  even  acknowledge  the  inaptness  of  a  modern  spatial  division  as  a  way  of  thinking  about contemporary media and communicative practices. As  of  March  2010,  Google’s  blogging  service,  Blogger   which  it  purchased from San Francisco-based Pyra labs in 2002 , was  still relying on the journals and journalism metaphors:  Professional and amateur journalists use blogs to publish break- ing news, while personal journalers reveal inner thoughts. Whatever you have to say, Blogger can help you say it.33  Given the problems that arise when blogs are viewed as a  genre,  boyd  advocates  viewing  blogs  as  a  medium,  as  more  like  radio  or  paper  than  a  novel  or  opera.  Blogs  serve  up  content for an audience of anyone, perhaps a few of the blog- ger’s friends, more likely for an uncertain number of strang- ers.  As  media,  blogs  change  and  evolve.  They  coexist  and  interlink  with  other  media   print,  video,  telephony,  etc. .  To   C2  DBG_02.indd   45  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   46  The	Death	of	Blogging  this  extent,  blogs  are  part  of  an  open  set  of  communicative  practices and technologies. As the spamblogs enact, anything,  any gibberish whatsoever, can be content. What is communi- cated, the content of blogs, is secondary or tertiary to the fact  of communication.34 In boyd’s words, “Blogs emerge because  bloggers are blogging.”  Blogging is a medium for and practice of communication.  Unlike mass media, it doesn’t target an imaginary community  of  everyone   in  the  nation,  state,  or  city .  Unlike  one-to-one  technologies  like  the  telephone  or  one-to-a-designated-list  technologies like email, blogging doesn’t presume to reach a  designated recipient. Nor does it rely on real-time interactions,  live  feeds   although  various  forms  of  syndication  can  alert  readers when a blog has been updated . Instead, the medium  enables  the  production  of  content  potentially  accessible  to  anyone  who  happens  to  find  it.  Blogging  opens  possible  encounters with the different and unexpected, whether in the  form of the blogger’s own reflection on what she posts or in  the reactions of others.  Some of the officiants at blogging’s premature funeral agree  with boyd on the centrality of the form. Writing for an elec- tronic  magazine  based  in  Australia,  Guy  Rundle  compares  blogs to the CB radio fad:  As with CBs, what thrilled people with blogs was “the ecstasy of  communication,”  the  pure  fact  of  being  out  there  in  the  wide  cyberworld  –  in  other  words,  the  form  rather  than  the  content.  What  stales  the  experience  is  what  some  have  thought  was  its  greatest attraction – its networked capacity, which makes every- one  producer  and  consumer,  and  hence  collapses  the  notion  of  an audience  since time does not expand, while blog numbers do . What most realize is that blogging is the illusion of connection,   publishing into a void and thus doubly isolating.35  Rundle’s  claim  for  an  “illusion  of  collection”  relies  on  his  elision  of  audience  and  communication.  Yes,  most  of  those  who expected blogging to lead to fame and fortune, to make  them  respected  pundits  or  highly  paid  authors,  those  who  presumed that blogs were typed television, would likely have  been  disappointed.  The  evidence  shows,  however,  that  ever   C2  DBG_02.indd   46  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  47  more  people  are  driven  to  communicate  with  others,  others  who may even be themselves, through blogs.36  5  The essence of the blog is the post. The post gets the blog off  the  ground.  And  keeps  it  going.  When  posts  stop,  the  blog  dies. If the blog owner doesn’t delete the entire blog, the posts  may  have  an  afterlife  available  to  search  engines  as  viable  permalinks on persisting blogs or even archived somewhere  along with the rest of the internet. Even if the entire blog is  deleted, the fact that posts can be copied, pasted, and repeated,  that  they  can  drift  and  circulate  throughout  the  information  networks of communicative capitalism, gives them a kind of  haunting permanence. Posts are blogs’ immortal remainders,  revenants that once released can never be fully contained. The  capacity of posts to circulate endlessly means that even dead  blogs persist as digital zombies.  What’s in a post? Anything. Blogging subjectivity isn’t nar- rativized.37 It’s posted. It’s not told as a story but presented in  moments as an image, reaction, feeling, or event. The post is  a form that expresses mediality as such. Blogs, and even more  so Twitter, catch oral communication in linear writing. Like a  phone  call  or  text  message,  a  post  attempts  connection.  Facebook  friends  similarly  “poke”  each  other  or  leave  short  remarks on each other’s walls. Unlike calls and text messages,  though, blog posts are stored, archived, and accessible to virtu- ally  anyone.  They  are  immediacy  saved,  conversations  pre- served. Posts persist as traces of their originators  whether the  originators be individuals, groups, or machines , traces of the  addition of something else.  The  addition  may  be  original  –  my  voice,  my  image,  my  remix. I contribute to mark not simply the fact that I am here,  that I have a view, but that I am engaging. I am participating  in  the  construction  and  extension  of  a  manner  of  being  together. If my addition is a tag or link, it contributes to the  force or impact of that which is tagged or linked, extending its  viability. It’s no wonder, then, that blogging services provide   C2  DBG_02.indd   47  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   48  The	Death	of	Blogging  so many tools for counting: How many lifetime page views?  How  many  last  month?  How  many  today?  How  many  this  hour? Which post generated the most hits? Which one accu- mulated the most links? These counts report what has been  added.  They  count  additions,  the  expansions  and  extensions  that are blogging. The value added, then, stems purely from  the being added.  Adding  creates  openings  for  new  links  or  connections.  Perhaps someone will respond. Perhaps the response will gen- erate more posts, more responses, something like a relation- ship.  This  possibility  infuses  additions  with  feeling,  makes  them carriers and transmitters of affect. Of course, a response  may not be a comment. It may be just a visit, registered as a  page  view  and  counted.

Instead of judging blog posts as a literary form, it is more  useful  to  consider  them  as  a  form  of  expression  in  between  orality and literacy, or perhaps as a kind of “secondary orality,”  to  use  Walter  Ong’s  term.38  While  the  idea  of  secondary  orality  remained  relatively  unexplored  at  the  time  of  Ong’s  death,  his  characterization  of  orally  based  thought  includes  attributes  already  key  features  of  mobile,  SMS,  and  online  communication:  1  Thoughts are combined and points are made in ways that  are additive rather than supportive; differently put, people  string syntactic elements together with “and” rather than  with subordinate clauses.  2  The elements of thoughts and ideas are aggregative rather  than  analytical   a  contemporary  example  might  be  the  slogans, clichés, and memes that catch on and stand-in for  ideas and feelings that remain unexplored . Ideas and points are frequently repeated.  3  4  Traditions  are  conserved   because  little  to  nothing  is  written down, remembering is difficult; hence, not only do  points need to be repeated but they need to be attributed  to tradition .  C2  DBG_02.indd   48  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  49  Ideas  are  understood  in  terms  of  their  connection  with  actual experience, with the lifeworld, rather than abstractly  or  within  a  more  general  analytic  field   if  I  don’t  know  anyone who has been the victim of homophobic violence, then  homophobic violence must not be a problem ;  6  Knowledge  and  ideas  appear  agonistically,  polarized,  as   part of everyday struggle. Ideas are treated in terms of empathy and its lack: that is  to  say,  in  an  immediate  and  participatory  rather  than  a  distanced fashion.  5   7   6  While  boyd  is  right  to  criticize  reading  blogs  through  the  metaphors of journaling and journalism, understanding why  these  metaphors  fail  tells  us  something  about  blogging  as  media practice. Yes, they fail because they focus on the content  of blogs rather than the practice of blogging, an increasingly  glaring  and  obvious  mistake  as  ever  more  paid  journalists  blog,  blogs  are  cited  in  mainstream  journalism  as  evidence  from ordinary people, bloggers appear in print and on televi- sion  and  radio,  and  internet  content  is  delivered  to  mobile  phones.  The  content  focus  can’t  keep  multiply  intersecting  modes  of  communication  in  view.  Additionally,  rather  than  following the conventions of either journaling or journalism,  blogging  occurs  in  a  space  that  opens  up  between  them,   when the news that matters is news of me and my opinion.  More  important,  though,  the  metaphors  of  journaling  and  journalism  fail  because  their  focus  on  the  content  misses   the  changes  in  subjectivity  and  setting  of  which  blogging  is   a part.  The  journaling  metaphor  takes  for  granted  the  personal  identity of the subject as diarist, an odd move given the likeli- hood that the blog is written pseudonymously.39 As journaling,  blogging  appears  as  a  technology  of  the  self,  a  way  of  docu- menting, reflecting on, and hence managing oneself. Although  this  idea  has  some  intuitive  appeal,  it  is  belied  by  the  long  history of self-writing. The reduction of blogging to journaling   C2  DBG_02.indd   49  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   50  The	Death	of	Blogging  overlooks the immense historical variety in practices of writing  and  their  relations  to  different  kinds  of  selves.  Presuming  a  kind  of  singularity  of  the  practice  of  self-writing,  moreover,  this reduction takes as given the continuity of the self, as if the  technologies of the self were somehow not productive, as if a  self stood behind the technologies of its own writing.40  Michel  Foucault  describes  some  of  the  early  practices  of  writing the self.41 In first- and second-century Rome, writing  contributed to an ascetic practice of training the self, of chang- ing the character by positing another before whom one would  feel  a  sense  of  shame.  Here  writing  is  not  simply  a  method  for recording one’s thoughts or reflecting on one’s actions. It  is a way of making present one who is not there, of summon- ing a companion in the imagination in order to feel the pres- sure of the other’s gaze. With the suppositions of an other and  of shame before this other, first- and second-century Romans,  Foucault argues, construe writing as a technique for changing  the self, not simply for recording its thoughts or for reflecting  on  these  thoughts.  Writing  is  a  training  with  effects  on  an  individual’s character and practice.  Foucault mentions the hupomnemata, individual notebooks  that aided memory. These were records of readings, sayings,  and thoughts, collections to be used for strength or sustenance  when  needed.  Foucault  explains  that  the  hupomnemata  con- tributed  to  the  formation  of  the  self  for  three  main  reasons:  “the limiting effects of the coupling of reading with writing;  the regular practice of the disparate that determines choices,  and  the  appropriation  which  that  practice  brings  about.”42  Reading was thought to orient the mind toward novelty, to lead  one to forget oneself and become scattered and distracted. By  writing, one could affirm a set of truths which would consti- tute not only an object upon which to reflect but a basis for  action.  Writing  the  fragments,  in  other  words,  enables  the  writer to subjectivize them, to make them his own, aspects of  his specific identity.  Another  kind  of  self-writing  was  correspondence,  letter  writing. The written letter enabled the author to make himself  present to others when he was apart, at a distance. Focusing  on Stoic and Epicurean practices, Foucault observes:  C2  DBG_02.indd   50  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  51  To write is thus to “show oneself,” to project oneself into view, to  make one’s own face appear in the other’s presence. And by this  should be understood that the letter is both a gaze that one focuses  on the addressee  through the missive he received, he feels looked  at  and a way of offering oneself to his gaze by what one tells him  about oneself.  .  .  .  The reciprocity that correspondence establishes  is not simply that of counsel and aid; it is the reciprocity of the  gaze and the examination.43  Letters did not need to be about anything in particular. As a  technique of the self, they weren’t highlighting major events  but rather testifying to “the quality of a mode of being.” Cicero,  for  example,  was  quite  explicit  about  his  affection  for  corre- spondence  for  its  own  sake,  regardless  of  whether  he  had  anything to say:  I prefer to write an empty letter than not to write at all.  This then is all I have for you, nothing new. “Why bother then  to write?” And when we are together, and chatter away with what- ever comes into our heads? Surely there is some value in causerie,  in which the mere interchange of talk is agreeable, even if there  nothing behind it.44  For Foucault, the ordinariness, the fact that nothing much has  happened, is what is noteworthy. Review of the ordinary gave  one insight into the kind of life one leads and thus was ideal  to a practice of self-examination. We might also emphasize the  way that expressing “whatever comes into our heads” creates  an opening to another, an opportunity for connection. What  matters, Cicero tells us, is less the content that enables con- nection  than  the  connection  itself.  There  is  some  value  in  causerie, or chat, a value attached to interchange.  While attentive to technologies of the self, Foucault is less  concerned with technologies of writing.45 Early written Latin  used interpuncts to designate separations between words. As  the Romans borrowed more letter forms and vowels from the  Greeks, however, they adopted the Greek practice of scriptura  continua or uninterrupted writing.46 That is, their letters were  spaced equally apart, regardless of the beginning and ending  of words. Scriptura continua made retrieving information after   C2  DBG_02.indd   51  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   52  The	Death	of	Blogging  it had been read difficult, to say the least.47 Unlike the Greeks,  moreover,  the  Romans  did  not  use  page  numbers,  foliation,  or catchwords, and only rarely paragraphs, to ease the presen- tation of textual material. Perhaps because of the suspicion of  reading  that  Foucault  notes,  Romans  did  not  want  to  make  reading any easier. Thomas N. Habinek makes the point more  directly, arguing that the material difficulties associated with  reading and writing “were convenient means of keeping litera- ture in the hands of the well-to-do elite.”48  For  wealthy  Romans,  writing  was  generally  dictation  and  reading was generally being read to.49 The aristocratic writer  relied  on  the  hands  and  skills  of  another  who  was  actually  reading or writing. Well-educated scribes had the difficult task  of making sense of written Latin. Reading was slow, painstak- ing,  and  likely  often  done  aloud  or  in  a  low  mumble.  Vocalization made it easier to turn letters into language sounds  and  language  sounds  into  meanings.  To  be  sure,  the  use  of  scribes  contributed  to  problems  in  authentication,  problems  addressed through the development of distinct personal styles  in expression as well as the use of seals.50  Elite  households  often  employed  trained  lectors  who  per- formed  texts  for  assembled  groups.  Texts,  then,  provided  opportunities for conversation and discussion; they were more  than  just  the  expression  of  an  author.  William  A.  Johnson  writes:  The odd format of the bookroll itself intersects with the fact that  literary texts were commonly “read” in the sense of a small group  listening to a “performance” by a reader. The strict – one wants  to say obsessive – attention to continuous flow in the design of  the ancient book interlocks with the idea that it was the reader’s  job to bring the text alive, to insert the prosodic features and illo- cutionary force lacking in the writing system. The continuous roll  was “played” by the reader much in the way that we play a video- tape or witness a stage performance.  .  .  .51  Even personal letters were often copied, circulated, and read  in groups, much like pamphlets or newspapers in later times.  Reading in groups was a common practice, a social activity and  type of entertainment. If self-writing was a technology of the   C2  DBG_02.indd   52  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  53  self, it was a technology deeply interlinked with connection to  an  audience  and  community.  Reading  and  writing,  for  the  ancient Romans, had aesthetic elements tied to the pleasures  of engagement with others.  7  Paul Saenger writes:  Word separation can be regarded as a product of the frontier civi- lizations that had developed at the periphery of what had been the  Roman  Empire.  Throughout  history,  intellectual,  technical,  and  social  innovations  have  often  first  appeared  on  the  margins  of  well-established  cultures.  America  and  Japan  can  properly  be  regarded as frontier civilizations, the former of Europe, the latter  of China. Although in the early Middle Ages the impetus for the  restructuring  of  the  page  had  come  from  the  literary  achieve- ments of the empire’s northern frontier, by the early tenth century  the prominence of the Insular authors identified with word sepa- ration such as Bede, Alcuin, Sedulius Scottus, Johannes Scottus,  and  the  anonymous  compilers  of  glossaries  had  waned.  A  new  corpus of scientific knowledge, and with it a new impetus for the  adoption  of  word  separation,  sprang  forth  in  another  linguistic  frontier zone, that of Mozarabic Spain.52  A product of globalization, blogging similarly emerges at the  intersections of differing languages, cultures, and discourses,  as the subsumption or folding into one another of their edges  and  frontiers.53  The  imagistic  properties  of  texts  that  enable  words to be seen as distinct units of meaning, as direct cor- respondents to objects and acts in the world, continue to inten- sify in this millennium as they did in the previous two. Can  one easily glean or absorb or be impressed by a written word,  be impressed so quickly that one hasn’t quite read it? Can one  quickly  identify  a  link?  Quickly  ascertain  the  presence  or  absence of something new? Can one immediately discern the  structure of the visual field so that one knows what not to read,  where to put one’s time or effort? Color, space, images – all  these establish the visual fields of blogs.  C2  DBG_02.indd   53  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   54  The	Death	of	Blogging  8  Foucault’s technologies of the self rely on the installation of a  gaze,  of  the  perspective  of  another  before  whom  the  subject  imagines itself. In a first instance, the installation of this gaze  can be thought of as the substitution of a symbolic position in  the  place  of  the  audience  of  others  customary  in  classical  textual performances. For the subject this gaze constitutes an  Other  “who  registers  my  acts  in  the  symbolic  network.”54  It  provides  the  subject  with  an  ego  ideal,  a  point  of  symbolic  identification. Žižek argues that this gaze is a crucial supposi- tion for the subject’s capacity to act. The gaze qua ego ideal is  the point from which one sees one’s actions as valuable and  worthwhile, as making sense. Absent that gaze, one may feel  trapped, passive, or unsure as to the point of doing anything  at  all.  To  this  extent,  identifying  with  the  gaze  enables  the  subject’s activity.  The  gaze  structures  our  relation  to  our  practices.  For  example,  instead  of  experiencing  the  state  as  myriad  forms  and organizations, branches and edicts, presences and regula- tions, in our daily activities we tend to posit the state as a kind  of entity, an Other aware of what we are doing. Similarly, we  may posit an enemy assessing our every action. The point is  that through symbolic identification the subject posits the very  entity it understands itself as responding to. How it imagines  this Other will be crucial to the kinds of activities the subject  can undertake.  Weirdly, then, the active subject has to posit a kind of pas- sivity: that is, a passive Other before whom the subject appears.  The subject has to imagine himself, in other words, as fasci- nating the Other, as doing something or saying something or  even  watching  something  and  that  captivates  the  Other.  As  Žižek emphasizes, the gaze is thus reflexive, doubled insofar  as  the  subject  sees  itself  being  seen.55  The  one  who  is  capti- vated, in other words, is the subject.  Although the subject needs to posit a gaze in order to under- stand  its  acts  as  mattering,  registering,  there  is  something  disturbing  about  the  gaze,  something  foreign  and  excessive,   C2  DBG_02.indd   54  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  55  unchosen and unwanted. Žižek writes that “in the case of the  gaze, the point to which the subject makes himself seen retains  its  traumatic  heterogeneity  and  nontransparency,  it  remains  an object in a strict Lacanian sense, not a symbolic feature.”56  In a setting of multiply interlinked media, we are never quite  certain to what we have made ourselves visible. We don’t know  who is looking at us or how they are looking. We can’t even  be  sure  whether  there  is  a  single  or  multiple  perspectives.  What databases are we in? Who has googled us and why?  This disturbing uncertainty points to a second, more trau- matic, version of the gaze, the gaze not as the big Other of the  ego ideal but as what Lacan refers to as the small other, objet  petit a. In this version, the gaze refers to our own entrapment  in the field of the visible: “I see only from one point, but in  my existence I am looked at from all sides.”57 What one sees  is always incomplete, in need of being filled in. Yet this filling- in necessarily brings with it inadequacies and distortions. The  subject might fill in what he wants to see; his desire may fill  in the gaps he encounters. He may then become aware of such  a  gap,  and  his  involvement  in  it,  feeling  himself  somehow  seen, even vulnerable. Each side of this relation to the gap  to  a lure or stain in the visible field  – the side of seeing it and  of being seen seeing it – is an aspect of the gaze.  Joan Copjec’s reading of Freud is one of the best accounts   of the gaze. Freud’s argument, she explains,  distinguishes the act of looking at oneself through the intermedi- ary of an alien object from the act of looking at oneself through an  alien person. The first concerns that reflexive circuit by which one  apprehends oneself in the categories of the culture to which one  belongs or of someone one wishes to please, with the result that  one thereby regards oneself as a known or knowable object. The  second concerns a completely different kind of circuit, that of the  active-passive  drive,  which  turns  around  on  itself.  In  this  case,  because I do not expose myself to the look of a determinate other,  I do not receive a message back regarding my determinate iden- tity. The reflexive circuit of scopic drive does not produce a know- able  object;  it  produces  a  transgression  of  the  pleasure  principle,  by  forcing a hole in it. The scopic drive produces an exorbitant plea- sure that disrupts the ego identity formed by the first circuit.58  C2  DBG_02.indd   55  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   56  The	Death	of	Blogging  I once thought I saw the postman sitting in his delivery truck  cuddling a puppy. This seemed odd. A second glance revealed  that  he  was  sorting  letters  and  that  there  was  no  puppy.  I  immediately  felt  embarrassed,  even  rather  ashamed.  It  was  almost as if there were a gaze in the postman– missing  puppy  complex that saw me see myself making this bizarre mistake.  It felt like I was caught not just making the mistake but real- izing the mistake. In Lacan’s words, “Generally speaking, the  relation between the gaze and what one wishes to see involves  a lure. The subject is not presented as other than he is, and  what  one  shows  him  is  not  what  he  wishes  to  see.”59  Gaze,  then, refers not to a specific person whom one imagines being  seen  by  but  rather  to  a  more  unsettling  feeling  of  an  excess  disturbing one’s seeing, both in terms of what one sees and  in one’s being seen.  Some  bloggers  find  themselves  disoriented  by  the  experi- ence that people they know read their blogs. We presumed we  were posting for strangers and ended up more exposed than  we  expected.  Our  families,  friends,  colleagues,  or  employers  were  lurking  on  our  blogs,  learning  about  our  passions  and  idiosyncrasies.  The  audiences  before  whom  we  perform  our  identities – child, expert, collector, lover – converged, under- mining the separations and distinctions that told us who we  were, rendering us nothing in particular, but still something.  Blogging is a technology uncoupled from the illusion of a core,  true,  essential,  and  singular  self.  The  subjects  of  blogs  are  fragmented, appearing as neither true nor false, just appearing  as whatever they happen to post.  More formally put, in communicative capitalism, the gaze  to  which  one  makes  oneself  visible  is  a  point  hidden  in  an  opaque and heterogeneous network. It is not the gaze of the  symbolic Other of our ego ideal but the more disturbing, trau- matic gaze of a gap or excess, objet petit a. Our disclosures are  surveilled,  archived,  remembered,  in  ways  that  exceed  our  ability  to  manage  or  control.  On  the  one  hand,  this  is  the  source  of  their  immense  attraction,  what  lures  us  in,  what  incites us to practices of revelation and display. On the other,  the  media  that  incite  us  to  create  and  express,  to  offer  our  thoughts,  feelings,  and  opinions  freely,  to  participate   but  in   C2  DBG_02.indd   56  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  57  what? ,  deliver  us  up  to  others  to  use  for  purposes  of  their  own.  Because  one  is  never  sure  how  one  is  seen,  one  is  never  certain of one’s place in the symbolic order. How, exactly, are  we  being  looked  at?  One  never  really  knows  who  one  is  – despite all the cameras, files, media, and databases. A celebrity  gamer  in  one  place  is  elsewhere  just  another  kid.  A  famous  jazz musician may have zero name recognition among econo- mists. Someone with a million friends on MySpace may be no  one at all to the rest of us. Facebook tries to help us out with  this by supplying endless quizzes that promise to tell us who  we really are – which Lord of the Rings character, which famous  philosopher, which ferocious animal. Who one is in the socio- symbolic order is uncertain – and ever-changing. The order is  never  fixed;  it  is  in  constant  flux.  Žižek  tags  this  flux  and  uncertainty as a decline in symbolic efficiency.  In  the  terms  of  Lacanian  theory,  the  decline  of  symbolic  efficiency is accompanied by a convergence between the imag- inary  and  the  Real.  Imaginary  identities  sustained  by  the  promise and provision of enjoyment replace symbolic identi- ties.  The  global  information  and  financial  networks  of  com- municative  capitalism  offer  new  ways  for  us  to  imagine  ourselves, immense varieties of lifestyles with which we can  experiment. Each can and must be creative, different, unique.  Each must develop a distinctive personal style. These unique  identities,  though,  are  extremely  vulnerable.  The  frames  of  reference  that  give  them  meaning  and  value  are  constantly  shifting.  Challenges  to  these  identities  can  appear  at  any  moment.  Others’  successes,  achievements,  and  capacities  to  enjoy  too  easily  call  our  own  into  question.  So  while  it  may  seem that the decline of symbolic efficiency ushers in a new  era of freedom from rigid norms and expectations, the fluidity  and  adaptability  of  imaginary  identities  are  accompanied  by  fragility and insecurity. Imaginary identities are incapable of  establishing a firm place to stand, a position from which one  can make sense of one’s experiences, one’s worlds. Blogs mark  and mediate these identities, whatever they might be.  Social  network  sites  respond  to  the  decline  of  symbolic  efficiency.  Anxious  before  the  gaze,  before  the  disturbing   C2  DBG_02.indd   57  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   58  The	Death	of	Blogging  inquiries  and  intrusions  of  unknown  others,  unsure  about  what  to  expect,  about  whether  one  is  succeeding  or  failing,  whether  others  are  friends  or  foes,  we  build  more  reliable,  apparently intimate networks. We may not know everyone in  our intimate network, but we know they are friends – we had  to friend them. Someone has vouched for them. We share a  connection or have a connection produced for us by virtue of  the games and gifts available on the site. With fewer strangers,  these  networks  are  less  stressful  that  the  open  uncertainties  disrupting  our  attempts  to  sense  who  we  are  or  might  be.  There are people we can trust, people who share with us little  moments  of  their  day,  assuring  us  that  there  might  still  be  some  reality  that  we  have  in  common.  Presenting  our  lives  and activities to our network, we attempt to install in ourselves  a capacity for action. Maybe that’s why cyber-bullying emerged  with  such  force  in  2007:  it’s  not  that  there  weren’t  bullies  before  MySpace  and  Facebook   bloggers  have  always  com- plained  about  trolls ;  it’s  that  people  continued  to  believe  in  and search for connection.  9  To emphasize the decline of symbolic efficiency is to empha- size a retreat from or effacement of the law of desire and an  amplification of the logic of drive. The primary setting for our  activity as communicating subjects is not law and its transgres- sion but drive’s repetitive circuit.  Žižek explains the difference between desire and drive via  a change in the position and function of objet petit a. He writes:  Although, in both cases, the link between object and loss is crucial,  in the case of the objet a as the object of desire, we have an object  which was originally lost, which coincides with its own loss, which  emerges as lost, while, in the case of the objet a as the object of  drive, the “object” is directly the loss itself – in the shift from desire  to drive, we pass from the lost object to loss itself as an object. That  is to say, the weird movement called “drive” is not driven by the  “impossible” quest for the lost object; it is a push to directly enact  the “loss” – the gap, cut, distance – itself.60  C2  DBG_02.indd   58  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   The	Death	of	Blogging  59  Drive  is  a  kind  of  compulsion  or  force.  It’s  a  force  that  is  shaped, that takes its form and pulsion, from loss. Drive is loss  as a force or the force loss exerts on the field of desire.  The  compulsive  movement  of  drive  shapes  networked  media as they enact the loss of symbolic efficiency. This enact- ment is not an effort to restore the symbolic. Rather, it’s the  “extraordinarily  plastic”  movement  of  the  drives,  to  borrow  Freud’s  expression.  Freud  continues,  “They  may  appear  in  each others’ places. One of them may accumulate the intensity  of the other.”61  That  the  drive  is  thwarted  or  sublimated  means  that  it  reaches it goal by other means, through other objects. Blocked  in one direction, it splits into multiple vectors, into a network.  If  Freud  views  the  process  as  akin  to  the  flow  of  water  into  multiple tributaries and canals, we might also think of it as an  acephalic power’s attempt to constitute and reach its objects  by any means necessary – and then to do it again and again  and  again  and  again,  getting  a  little  enjoyment  in  each  repetition.  Lacan  emphasizes  that  the  drives  are  partial  drives.  He  specifies this idea as “partial with regard to the biological final- ity of sexuality.”62 I understand the point to refer to the variety  of changing, incomplete, and dispersed ways subjects enjoy.  Drives do not develop in a linear fashion from infant to adult.  They  fragment  and  disperse  as  they  satisfy  themselves  via  a  variety of objects. As Copjec writes, “It is as if the very function  of the drive were this continuous opening up of small fractures  between things.”63 Her language here is precise: the fractures  are not of things but between them; the parts that are objects  of the drives are not parts of wholes but parts that appear in  the force of loss as new expressions of a whole. She uses Gilles  Deleuze’s example of the role of the close-up as a cinematic  device: it’s not part of a scene enlarged; rather, it’s an expres- sion  of  the  whole  of  the  scene.64  Lacan  refers  to  the  partial  object as an object of lack, an object that emerges in the void  of the drive to provide the subject with satisfaction.  Correlative  to  the  part  is  a  further  aspect  of  drive  that   Lacan renders as montage, a constant jumping without transi- tion  between  heterogeneous  elements.  Montage  suggests   C2  DBG_02.indd   59  4 9 2010   1:36:09 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   60  The	Death	of	Blogging  movement without message, movement with intensity, move- ment  outward  and  back.  Disparate  images  and  sounds  shift  and mutate without beginning or end, head or tail. Lacan: “I  think the resulting image would show the working of a dynamo  connected  up  to  a  gas-tap,  a  peacock’s  feather  emerges,  and  tickles  the  belly  of  a  pretty  woman,  who  is  just  lying  there  looking beautiful.”65 More contemporary ways to understand  montage are mash-ups, samples, and remixes – or, better, our  very  movement  through  contemporary  communication  and  entertainment networks. I enter. I click. I like. I poke. Drive  circulates, round and round, producing satisfaction even as it  misses  its  aim,  even  as  it  emerges  in  the  plastic  network  of  the decline of symbolic efficiency.  10  In  the  Ethics  of  Psychoanalysis  Lacan  positions  drive  between  the two deaths, symbolic death and the death of the organism.  Blogging after the death of the blogs persists in an analogous  domain of the drive. Caught in the circuits of communicative  capitalism out of which it emerged, it persists, whether in the  form  of  fully  automated  splogs,  the  remnants  of  past  posts  excavated and ranked by Google, or our compulsions to make  ourselves seen.

By the time she was seven- teen,  she  was  making  over  a  million  dollars  a  year  from  Whateverlife.com,  the  busy  pink  website  she  designed  to  market  MySpace  page  layouts.  Market  is  not  quite  the  right  word, though. Her layouts and ad-ons weren’t for sale. They  were  free.  Her  income  came  from  advertising.  Because  Whateverlife.com gets more than sixty million hits a month,  exceeding  the  circulation  of  several  of  the  most  popular  English-language teen magazines combined, it supplies adver- tisers with a valuable commodity, the eyeballs of teenage girls.  Qualls, or “AshBo” as she calls herself, started Whateverlife. com in 2004. By 2007, she had expanded her site into some- thing close to a community for girls, a go-to site where girls  could find tutorials for making their own layouts as well as a  variety  of  images,  banners,  captions,  buttons,  and  boxes  for  decorating  their  MySpace  pages.  In  addition  to  the  revenue- generating  ads,  Whateverlife.com   with  its  growing  staff  of  writers  and  designers   features  a  magazine  and  a  link  to  AshBo’s blog on her MySpace page.  Although  Qualls’  popularity  is  exceptional,  her  profile  fits  the  dominant  one  for  US  bloggers:  she  is  under  thirty  and  female.1  The  Pew  Internet  and  American  Life  Project  report  on  Teens  and  Social  Media  provides  some  context:  only  8  percent of adult internet users in the US have created a blog,  but 28 percent of online teens blog, and these are most likely  to be girls.

By  2007  she  was  earning  enough  from  Whateverlife.com to drop out of high school and purchase a  house.3  AshBo explains how she came up with name for her site:  is  why  I’m  always  expanding   WhateverLife.com is simply put as an “inside joke”. It then devel- oped  into  something  else  –  as  “For  whatever  life  you  lead”  –  meaning there would be information and fun things for anyone  and  everyone!

Here it  is. :  ♥ ]]]  “Whatever” sprouts up all over the new media environment.  Sightings include a blog by writer John Scalzi, a music video  called “United States of Whatever,” by Liam Lynch  as well as  its  remixes  into  cartoons  of  George  W.  Bush  responding  to  comments that could suggest disagreement with his policies  with the phrase “Whatever. This is my United States of what- ever” , multiple home video clips of babies saying “whatever”  on YouTube, and a show called whatever with Alexis and Jennifer  on the Martha Stewart channel on Sirius satellite radio. The  show features the “whatever girls,” Stewart’s daughter, Alexis,  and  her  friend,  Jennifer  Koppelmann  Hutt   the  daughter  of  Stewart’s producer . In addition to their radio show, the what- ever girls have blogs, bulletin boards, and an online shop for  buying “whatever” merchandise.4 Whatever is also the title of  a 1998 movie about teens in the pre-AIDS eighties  directed  by  Susan  Skool   and  an  internationally  acclaimed  novel  by  Michel Houellebecq, published in French in 1988.  Ashley Qualls provides an image of blogging as a popular  technological practice of content production, media use, and  multiple platform integration inscribed into everyday life such  that  there  is  little  difference  between  being  on-  or  offline.  Together  with  the  statistical  snapshots  provided  by  the  Pew   C2  DBG_03.indd   62  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  63  Internet  and  American  Life  Project,  this  image  might  let  us  feel like we are accessing a truth about blogs and social net- works: they are by and for teenage girls. Both produce affective  spaces  where  they  express  themselves,  share  their  feelings,  and reach out with a little hope that someone will be touched  and reach back. Accessed through the intense emotional world  of  networked  adolescence,  blogs  aren’t  confined  to  a  sphere  separate from other media. They are situated in a rich com- municative habitat consisting of multiple platforms and appli- cations  mobile phones, social network sites, video, music, and  photo sharing sites . Blogs seem, then, to be ways that anyone  of us could report on, share, experience, and even market our  social lives. With a little luck, we could even earn revenue on  ads  accompanying  each  and  every  heartfelt  expression.  Feelings can be profitable.  2  The  image  constituted  through  the  combination  of  statistics  and the experience of a single blogger is too easy, even as it  highlights  the  juxtaposition  between  the  singular  and  the  many characteristic of contemporary networked media. Rather  than relying on one to stand in for an impossible whole, we  do better to consider the rise of personalized media as a mass  phenomenon and practice. By 2008, there were from eighty  to  a  hundred  and  twenty  million  blogs.5  The  overwhelming  majority of these blogs appear and die in a matter of months,  having been seen by few if any readers. Blogs are many and  innumerable,  an  open,  changing,  set  of  unique  expressions.  At  the  same  time,  the  standardization  supplied  by  blog  ser- vices – the basic page layouts, archival features, titles, banners,  ads, and widgets – format blogs as ultimately interchangeable,  the same, one virtually indistinguishable from another.  An  easy  test:  from  the  Blogger  dashboard   www.blogger. com ,  click  on  the  “next  blog”  link;  repeat  again  and  again.  You’ll move through various blogs in various languages, seem- ingly  at  random.  I’ve  encountered  blogs  featuring  photos  of  horse  hoofs  and  how  to  care  for  them,  travel  photos,  old  watches,  pie  recipes,  wedding  preparations.  On  my  screen,   C2  DBG_03.indd   63  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   64  Whatever	Blogging  configured  within  Blogger’s  range  of  possible  layouts,  the  blogs blend into and substitute one for another.  The common format that makes blogs blogs is a condition  for  the  unique  productions  of  singular  bloggers.  And  vice  versa: without the unique offerings, indeed, the promise that  each  voice  can  be  heard,  each  experience  documented,  each  opinion expressed, blogging has no point.  We can approach this same entanglement from a different  direction:  blogs  offer  exposure  and  anonymity  at  the  same  time. As bloggers we expose ourselves, our feelings and experi- ences,  loves  and  hates,  desires  and  aversions.  Yet  we  often  write as if we’ve opened ourselves to nearly no one, to just a  select  few,  to  a  small  community  of  those  we  trust,  perhaps  because  we  cannot  see  them.  Knowing  full  well  that  we  are  one  among  millions,  we  may  find  ourselves  relieved  not  to  have so many hits, so many comments. Strangers and oppo- nents remind us of our exposure, our visibility, vulnerability,  and ultimate lack of control.  After I gave a talk as part of a symposium on evil at MIT, a   neo-Nazi found my blog, I Cite. He wrote:  You  live  in  an  environment  where  debate  is  not  free,  and  your  half-witted ideas are protected and allowed an existence that expo- sure  to  reason  would  not  accord  them.  .  .  .  You  imply  here  that  you are being criticized because you criticized Bush. No. You are  being  criticized  because  you  sounded  stupid  while  criticizing  Bush.  .  .  .  God, what do you think of the world? Do you think there  are  some  politically-correct  blog  police  that  are  going  to  stop  people from criticizing you, like they do at your university? In the  United States there is a First Amendment, and just like the First  Amendment allows you to prattle on like a moron with vapid ideas  that no real person takes seriously, it allows people to point out  that your ideas are vapid and you’re prattling on like a moron. Not  everyone has to be nice to you; not everyone has to agree to you;  and your extreme pathological reaction to criticism is disturbing.  You are not fully developed psychologically, and I strongly recom- mend you quit your job and go out into the real world to toughen  up a bit, because if you can’t debate a few easy criticisms, at some  point, the real world will eat you. Even the moron claiming I’m a  racist slumlord is doing better than you.  C2  DBG_03.indd   64  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  65  I didn’t respond. I didn’t know how to. It’s as if his remarks  momentarily  shattered  the  presumptions  and  expectations  that enabled me to write so openly, exposing their specificity,  their fragility, their context dependency, confronting me with  the fact that my fantasized audience was not my real one.  Blogs can be useful political tools: they let activists report  on their activities, plans, and aspirations. They help them meet  up  and  coordinate.  At  the  same  time,  they  deliver  a  lot  of  knowledge  to  activists’  opponents,  the  university  officials  wanting to know which students are responsible for the sit-in,  the law enforcement officials trying to diminish the impact of  planned demonstrations, to discourage activists from going too  far. Privacy and consumer protection advocates remind us of  the accumulation of data on consumers, data easily mined for  the sake of the increasingly specific and personalized targeting  of ads. Yet this information in need of protection is the open  content of millions of blogs and social network profiles. Blogs  make monitoring easy. There’s no need to spy! I’ll tell you every- thing  .  .  .  and  more!  In  short,  blogging  relies  on  a  fantasy  of  exposure without exposure correlative to the indistinguishable  mass  of  the  singularly  unique.  It’s  like  the  thrill  of  telling  a  secret without being burdened by anxiety over its being told  – exposure without exposure.  Social networks like MySpace and Facebook deploy a similar  fantasy – one can share one’s life with one’s friends without  repercussion. On the one hand, because one has specifically  friended  those  in  one’s  network,  one  can  rest  assured  that  one’s secrets are safe. If you can’t trust your friends, who can you  trust? On the other, the drive to grow one’s network  Look! I’m  somebody! I’ve got thousands of friends – they like me; they really  like me! , to friend people with whom one works, people from  different parts of one’s life, belies the illusion of control over  one’s personal information. Not only is one’s data shared with  third parties, but the surveys and games that flourish in social  network environments expand third-party access: access to my  friend  is  a  way  of  getting  access  to  me.  A  typical  Facebook  profile reveals a person’s name, age, birthday, location, occu- pation,  high  school  and or  university,  relationship  status,  sexual  orientation,  political  affiliation,  religion,  and  personal   C2  DBG_03.indd   65  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   66  Whatever	Blogging  appearance.  Add  to  this  the  fact  that  most  users  mention  events they attend, groups to which they belong, causes they  support, and the result is a heavy degree of exposure.6  Typically, we respond to these seemingly paranoid lines of  thought  with  deflection  –it  isn’t  me  about  whom  data  is  col- lected; it’s us – an aggregate. It’s our patterns, not mine. It’s  how many of us refer to a new movie or click on an ad, not  whether  I  do.  As  with  blogging,  our  participation  in  social  networks relies on the supposition that we expose but are not  exposed, that we are unique but ultimately indistinguishable.  3  Developing  a  notion  offered  by  Giorgio  Agamben,  Dominic  Pettman  considers  the  problem  of  the  interchangeable  yet  irreplaceable  in  terms  of  “whatever  being.”  For  Pettman,  as  for Agamben, whatever being points to new modes commu- nity and new forms of personality anticipated by the dissolu- tion of inscriptions of identity through citizenship, ethnicity,  and other modern markers of belonging. Describing the char- acter  actor  as  exemplary  of  whatever  being,  Pettman  glosses  the  concept  as  “an  enactment  of  existence  without  qualities,  or at least qualities so interchangeable and obvious that they  erase all identity.” In positive terms, whatever being is a tag  for the “sheer generic potentiality of being.”7  Agamben emphasizes that the “whatever” in whatever being  relates not to singularity as indifference to a common property  “but only in its being such that it is.” He writes:  In  this  conception,  such-and-such  being  is  reclaimed  from  its  having  this  or  that  property,  which  identifies  it  as  belonging  to  this  or  that  set,  to  this  or  that  class   the  reds,  the  French,  the  Muslims  – and it is reclaimed not for another class nor for the  simple generic absence of any belonging, but for its being-such,  for  belonging  itself.  Thus  being-such,  which  remains  constantly  hidden in the condition of belonging  “there is an x such that it  belongs to y”  and which is in no way a real predicate, comes to  light itself: The singularity exposed as such is whatever you want,  that is lovable.8  C2  DBG_03.indd   66  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  67  There is belonging, but not to anything in particular. Something  in particular is insofar as it belongs. Asking “to what?,” Pettman  and Agamben suggest, mistakenly prioritizes the set over the  very  condition  of  belonging.  What  matters  is  belonging,  not  that to which one belongs.  At  the  same  time,  “mattering”  triggers  an  intervention   into what could seem little more than another way of designat- ing  indifference.  Mattering  matters.  It’s  the  interjection   or  scission  of  love  and  desire,  of  wanting.  What  matters  stands  out  from  the  mass  or  multiple  because  it  matters.   As Pettman suggests, that I love it, desire it, separates it from  the  endless,  open,  uncountable  set  of  indistinguishable  members.  There are over a hundred million blogs. At least one of them   is mine.  4  In  US  popular  vernacular,  “whatever”  is  an  affective,  verbal  response  that  deflects  another’s  comment.  It  is  generally  uttered  in  response  not  to  a  question,  but  to  a  statement  or  observation  through  which  another  might  be  attempting  to  harness the recipient or hearer.  “You haven’t cleaned your room.” “Whatever.” One of multiple video mash-ups of Liam Lynch’s punk-pop  “Whatever” combines images of George W. Bush and his vice  president,  Dick  Cheney,  Lynch’s  guitar  tracks,  and  a  Bush- impersonation voice-over. Bush yells:  I’m  George  W.  Bush,  leader  of  the  free  world.  I  want  to  bomb  Iraq. And when the world says, “no!” I say, “whatever!”  Saddam has started to meet our demands. Yeah, whatever.  He  sings  the  refrain,  “ ‘cause  this  is  my  United  States  of  whatever.”  The  response  “whatever”  registers  the  fact  of  another   utterance,  of  a  communicative  effort  or  engagement.  It  acknowledges  communicativity  through  the  deflection  of    C2  DBG_03.indd   67  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   68  Whatever	Blogging  the  communicative  effort.  The  sender’s  message   whether  understood in terms of its content or its intent, whether con- scious or unconscious  is neither accepted nor rejected. Rather,  the “whatever” response distills the message into the simple  fact of utterance.  “Whatever”  resembles  the  response  of  Herman  Melville’s  “Bartleby,” the scrivener who replies “I would prefer not to”  when  given  a  task  or  instruction.9  For  some  contemporary  philosophers  for example, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri ,  Bartleby provides a figure of refusal, opposition, or resistance,  a  model  of  escape  or  disentanglement  from  the  relations  of  power constitutive of contemporary capitalist control societies.  The argument is premised on power’s dependence on resis- tance:  the  transgression  of  the  law  calls  law  into  being.  Or,  protestors need police brutality in order demonstrate the valid- ity of their protests. Bartleby, then, suggests a way out of the  dialectic of law and its transgression. Side-stepping resistance,  he deprives power of its hold.  Yet even as Bartleby evades the circuit of power and resis- tance by refusing to refuse, he continues to rely on his position  as  a  singular  subject:  he  says  “I,”  referring  to  himself  as  a  subject, and not just any subject, but a subject with a view, a  preference.  As  such,  he  remains  exposed  to  power.  He  still  cares.  In  response  to  a  request,  Bartleby  does  more  than  acknowledge communication, the fact that a message has been  delivered and received. His answer affirms the intelligibility of  the  request  even  as  it  challenges  the  normative  expectations  informing  it.  And  rather  than  challenging  the  sender  of  the  message’s authority to make the request he makes, Bartleby  asserts himself as what matters – he would prefer not to. He  is a subject with preferences, and these preferences must be  attended to.  In  contrast,  the  only  affirmation  in  “whatever”  is  of  com- munication  as  such.  Another  has  communicated.  This  com- munication  in  no  way  obligates  me  as  the  recipient  of  the  message.  By  responding  “whatever,”  I  have  signaled  the  minimum  degree  of  awareness  of  communicative  being:  a  message is sent in expectation of a response  after all, I didn’t  completely ignore you . “Whatever” asserts no preferences. It   C2  DBG_03.indd   68  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  69  neither affirms nor rejects. And it doesn’t expose the subject  as a desiring subject to whom something matters.  There is also an affective dimension to “whatever,” an inso- lence or attitude or provocation that arises out of its function  as a non-responsive response. By acknowledging communica- tion without attending to the content of the message, “what- ever” denies the sender the sense that her message has been  received because its content remains unaddressed. The sender  is challenged, her position as sender undermined. “Whatever”  forestalls  a  communicative  exchange  even  as  it  adopts  com- municative  form.  It  refrains  from  establishing  the  subject  position  of  the  one  who  responds  with  “whatever,”  and  it  unsettles the position of the one who initiates the exchange.  It’s a glitch in orality.  If communicativity such that it is, whatever communicativ- ity,  tags  forms  of  subjectivity  and  belonging  discernible  in  contemporary  media  practices,  who  and  what  is  likely  to  benefit?  What  kinds  of  political  and  economic  relations  are  likely to flourish in these new communicative habitats?  Whatever it takes.  5  By now an extensive literature exists documenting the produc- tion of national identities through media and communication  technologies. Susan Buck-Morss’s Dreamworld and Catastrophe  is one of the best contributions to this research. Buck-Morss  explores the mass identities of utopian and project-based states  such  as  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union  during  the  twentieth  century.  She  highlights  the  dreams  and  fantasies  enabled by the movies, the imaginings of collectivity that film  incited.  For  communists  and  capitalists  alike,  twentieth-  century technological projects were also identity projects. Four  components of Buck-Morss’s account are particularly compel- ling: mass media’s direct addressing of society; the way mass  media change the nature of crowds; the spectacular function  of mass media; and the compensatory logic of mass media’s  organization of space.  C2  DBG_03.indd   69  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   70  Whatever	Blogging  First, many have noted the ways mass media address, well,  masses.  Radio  brought  leaders’  voices  directly  into  people’s  homes, integrating leaders into their intimate spaces. Broadcast  television likewise occupied a domestic space as it addressed  its audience as personal members of a nation, perhaps imag- ined like a family  respected newscaster Walter Cronkite was  affectionately referred to as “Uncle Walt” . But film in particu- lar, with its large screen and grand scale, organized and spoke  to the masses as a collective. The nation as national society is  produced  through  the  media  address   whether  newspaper,  radio,  television,  or  film ,  with  no  existence  as  such  prior  to  this address.  Second, in a nuanced reading of the role of film production  in the US and USSR during the 1930s, Buck-Morss observes,  Whereas the radio voice allowed mass identification with political  leaders, cinema, traveling to towns and villages to meet audiences  halfway, represented a moving image of the masses that allowed  audiences to recognize themselves. Such mirroring can be impor- tant in transforming the accidental crowd  mass-in-itself  into the  self-conscious, purposeful crowd  the mass-for-itself , with at least  the potential of acting out its own destiny.10  Unlike  the  moving  carnival,  whose  spectators  aggregate  and  disperse,  cinema  organizes,  locates,  and  seats  its  spectators.  Their attention is directed to a single place, to the screen. The  unity of the screen produces out of the disunity of persons a  singular audience that can see and recognize itself as a collec- tive: “we” are watching this movie. For the Soviets, the films  of  Sergei  Eisenstein  played  a  particularly  powerful  role.  Eisenstein captured and glorified intense scenes of revolution- ary masses, images that became the memories of the October  Revolution. Buck-Morss writes, “The particular characteristics  of the screen as a cognitive organ enabled audiences to see the  materiality not only of the new collective protagonist, but also  of  other  ideal  entities:  the  unity  of  the  revolutionary  people,  the idea of international solidarity, the idea of the Soviet Union  itself.”11  Similarly,  in  the  United  States,  cinema  changed  the  nature of the crowd by providing an imaginary mass body. In   C2  DBG_03.indd   70  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  71  the early twentieth-century US, ethnic groups, religions, politi- cal organizations, and racist law worked against the image and  goal of a unified political identity. Film countered these forces,  offering massive cinematic bodies as points of singular iden- tification. It was a crucial vehicle for mass assimilation via the  production  of  a  common  culture  and  collective  experience.12  And  as  Buck-Morss  emphasizes,  the  potential  power  of  this  new collectivity was enormous, whether as a force of produc- tion, consumption, or politics.  Third,  Buck-Morss  points  out  the  potential  for  manipula- tion in cinema. In an argument reminiscent of Guy Debord’s  critique  of  the  society  of  the  spectacle,  she  notes  how  both  Hollywood  and  Soviet  cinema  “affirmed  official  culture  and  denied  certain  bleak  realities  of  social  development.”13  The  former presented dream versions of commodity consumption.  Monumental  stars,  awesome  production  numbers   Busby  Berkeley  and special effects  King Kong , and luxurious life- styles  captivated  Depression-era  audiences  and  attempted  to  channel  their  desire  toward  fantasies  of  consumption.  The  latter idealized production. Although Soviet film in the twen- ties continued the avant-garde experimentation of the revolu- tionary period  which was itself heavily influential in the US   even as it imported Hollywood movies, by the thirties socialist  realism and the glorification of collective projects was cultur- ally dominant. The chief of Soiuzkino  Soviet Cinema , Boris  Shumiatskii, rejected Soviet art cinema as overvaluing formal- ism and aesthetics. A better model for socialist realism could  be found in Hollywood, which employed a factory-like model  of artistic production and a realistic style of “joyful spectacles”  accessible to the masses.14 One of the most successful Soviet  films of this period was Chapaev, an action movie about the  defeat  of  the  White  Russians  in  the  Civil  War  that  out-  Western-ed the Hollywood movies it was modeled on.  Finally, the fourth aspect of Buck-Morss’s discussion of the  role of film in the production and imagining of mass national  identities important for my argument is the division between  public  and  private  spheres.  Here  the  Soviet  and  US  cultural  imaginaries are inversions of each other: the space that for one  was a fantasized site of fulfillment was for the other a site of   C2  DBG_03.indd   71  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   72  Whatever	Blogging  drudgery.  “The  forced  intimacy  of  the  communal  apartment  was a particular kind of terror affecting the most banal prac- tices of every day,” Buck-Morss explains. Insofar as public life  under Stalinism was itself presented as the location of purpose  and fulfillment, “there was no need for retreat into a private  domain.”15  Conversely,  in  the  US,  factory  work  generally  appeared  as  a  particularly  brutal,  humiliating,  kind  of  labor.  Workers were subjected to control, subjection, the daily con- straints and degradations of the assembly line. Rather than a  source of fulfillment, industrial work was necessary drudgery.  In return, workers received compensation in the form of con- sumption, enjoying consumer goods in the context of the love  and  warmth  of  the  nuclear  family.  Buck-Morss  writes,  “the  ideology  of  the  private  home  came  to  bear  a  tremendous  burden,  that  of  legitimating  the  entire  system  of  industrial  capitalism, and nowhere more so than in the United States.”16  6  What fantasies, what possibilities, what kinds of subjects, do  multiply intersecting and increasingly personalized media and  communication technologies stimulate? Differently put, how  might  changes  from  the  media  constitutive  of  projects  of  national utopian imagination lead in the direction of whatever  beings? The pleasures of parallels with Buck-Morss’s discus- sion of film and national mass identities suggest that answers  might be found in at least four domains.  First, if mass media addressed society directly, organizing  and  speaking  to  masses  as  collectives,  contemporary  net- worked  communications  have  multiple  addressees,  address- ees known and unknown, friends and strangers. Bloggers may  write  for  others  whom  they  imagine  share  their  interests,  a  group of the uniformed they might enlighten, or future ver- sions of themselves. The set of friends who receive my updates  on  Facebook,  my  network,  are  uniquely  mine.  Each  user’s  network is different, even as they overlap and intersect. Blogs  and  social  networks  do  not  provide  broadly  shared  symbolic  identities  from  which  we  see  ourselves.  Blogs  don’t  address   C2  DBG_03.indd   72  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  73  society  writ  large.  They  invite  singular  readers  to  consider  what they have on offer. Or they just make themselves avail- able  to  be  found  by  search  engines’  crawlers.  Unlike  mass  media’s calling of collectives, publics, and nations into being,  blogs don’t unite bloggers and readers. To this extent, they are  more like pencils than cinema. They remain specific in their  multiplicity.  Second, whereas mass media made crowds visible to them- selves as a unity, providing the crowd with an imaginary col- lective  body,  networked  communication  and  entertainment  makes particularities visible to themselves as particularities. I  can  tweet  my  current  location,  update  my  friends  on  my  current  mood,  check  what’s  trending.  With  multiply  conver- gent  and  turbulent  media,  I  don’t  have  to  settle  on  any  one  direction or theme. I can live in the momentary. Not only do  these  multiple,  circulating  impulses  incite  in  me  a  kind  of  permanent  indecision  or  postponement,  a  lack  of  commit- ment – what else is out there? – but the fragmenting, network- ing, thrust of drive turns my particular body, my very face, into  a montage: a wrinkle here, a bump there, a nose too large, lips  too small. Fortunately, I can update my photo at any time –  and  I  can  animate  it,  too!  There  is  no  us.  There  is  no  me   although I can google myself to see if I turn up . Buck-Morss  argues that “Cinema creates an imagined space where a mass  body  exists  that  can  exist  nowhere  else.”17  My  point  is  that  blogs – standing in for the networked information and enter- tainment  media  of  communicative  capitalism  –  not  only  do  not create such a space for a mass body but dissolve any sense  of  it.  They  dis-place  it,  producing  instead  ever-accelerating  circuits  of  images,  impulses,  fragments,  and  feelings.  Blogs  cannot be counted; they resist inclusion into sets or categories.  Yes, cinema still exists and sometimes it lets us feel ourselves  as something like an us  .  .  .  and then I can tweet about it. Blog  mapping  projects  attempt  to  make  multiple  disparate  blogs  appear  as  a  sphere,  a  collective,  as  points  in  a  shared  space.  But the space they map is in the imaginary of the researcher,  not in bloggers’ presence to themselves as a collective.  Third,  the  cinematic  spectacles  produced  by  Hollywood   and the Soviet Union in the 1930s generally sought to affirm   C2  DBG_03.indd   73  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   74  Whatever	Blogging  official culture and deny the grimmer aspects of economic and  social life. In contrast, blogs persist in a setting of total medial- ity:  anything  can  be  found,  said,  seen  on  the  internet.  With  publicity as the ideology of communicative capitalism, every- thing  can  be  said;  nothing  need  be  denied.  Every  aspect  of  contemporary life is reflected upon, criticized, mocked – and  then the reflections, criticisms, and mockeries are themselves  reflected upon, criticized, mocked  .  .  .  did we go too far? In this  setting,  nothing  is  unworthy  of  comment  or  commentary.  Every aspect of the ordinary and everyday matters to someone  –  for  like  a  second.  Blogs  say  that  whatever  happens  to  me  matters – in and of itself. And in this reflexive environment,  even the fact that my posts are boring, that the arguments in  my  little  segment  of  the  blogipelago  have  an  intensity  far  beyond  merit,  that  the  escapades  of  celebrities  captured  by  TMZ are trivial, even all these facts are known and discussed.  Most of the time, the repetitive intensities of blog drama are  inversions of politics, rapidly circulating differences and mod- ulations  that  ensure  that  nothing  changes.  Sometimes  the  intensities  accumulate,  “punctuated  by  catastrophic  events,  which are both creative and destructive.”18 Markets boom and  bust; terrorists attack; a children’s book becomes a global sen- sation. The circuits adjust and recalibrate, capturing the new  again in the snares of communicative capitalism.  Fourth,  just  as  the  official  myth  of  fulfillment  through  factory labor collapsed with the end of Stalinism  people didn’t  have to pretend anymore that it was true; they still had to go  to  work ,  the  myth  of  idealized  domesticity  crumpled  in  the  US, in part because of the achievements of feminism, in part  because the realities of divorce, infidelity, addiction, and abuse  made  its  fantasy  impossible  to  sustain.  Television  and  femi- nism both made the personal political, erasing the fragile and  imaginary boundaries between public and private, a line that  made little sense after the rise of the social. In the remnants  of  the  myth  of  idealized  domesticity,  ideals  of  individual  freedom  and  creativity  are  promoted.  Personal  satisfaction  takes the place of familial duty. Differently put, family life is  supposed  to  be  personally  rewarding   rather  than  a  duty  or  expectation .  When  family  life  fails  to  satisfy,  it  is  examined   C2  DBG_03.indd   74  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  75  and diagnosed, offered remedies and supplements – the family  better succeed because the brutal competition of neoliberalism  offers neither shelter nor respite. Communicative capitalism  provides the form and vehicle for the individualized consump- tion,  participation,  and  creative  needs  expression  of  subjects  compelled to be personally satisfied.  Correlative to the erasure of the always tenuous distinction  between  the  public  and  private  spheres  is  the  dissolution  of  the  boundary  between  work  and  play.  From  the  initial  elec- tronics boom in the seventies through the larger shifts associ- ated with personal computers and the internet, informatization  has promised those who work with symbols and ideas increased  ease  and  comfort.  Early  versions  celebrated  tele-commuting  and  the  paperless  office.  Later  versions  preyed  on  fears  of  being left behind, out of the loop, not as quick as the competi- tion.  Consultants  urged  corporations  to  restructure  work,  to  encourage  creativity  and  team-building,  to  make  work  more  like play. At the same time, with ever more games and interac- tions moving online, onto screens, play seemed a little more  like  work.  In  the  circuits  of  communicative  capitalism,  the  repetitions of drive suggest work without work  in the forms  of work without pay or work that is fun  and play without play   in the forms of play for which one is paid and play for which  one pays with enjoyment . This, then, is the setting wherein  blogs are not escapes from the drudgery of part of one’s life.  They  are  not  fantastic  experiments  in  virtual  reality.  Rather,  blogs instead extend out from, amplify, and reflect on what- ever aspect of whatever life.  7  The  change  marked  by  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  has  been  tagged the end of ideology, the end of the Keynesian welfare  state, the decline of the Fordist model of production, and the  beginning of globalization, the information age, the network  society, communicative capitalism. In their account of the new  formation, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri accentuate the  passage  from  disciplinary  society  to  the  society  of  control.   C2  DBG_03.indd   75  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   76  Whatever	Blogging  Focusing on the capitalist societies of the US, UK, and Europe,  they point out how disciplinary logics worked primarily within  the institutions of civil society to produce subjects. By the end  of  the  twentieth  century,  these  mediating  institutions  –  the  nuclear  family,  the  prison,  the  school,  the  union,  and  the   local  church  –  were  in  crisis.  The  spaces,  logics,  practices,   and  norms  previously  coalescing  into  social  and  economic  institutions have broken down and apart. Their efficacy is now  indeterminate. In other words, in some instances, the release  of an institutional logic from its spatial constraints has given  it  all  the  more  force;  in  other  instances,  the  opposite  has  occurred.  Corresponding to this pervasive dissolution and indetermi- nacy   which  itself  necessarily  correlates  with  the  economic  changes of informatization and the ubiquitous spread of net- worked communications  is an “indeterminacy of the form of  the subjectivities produced.”19 Hardt and Negri argue that the  old  political  subject  –  the  citizen-subject  of  an  autonomous  political  sphere,  the  disciplined  subject  of  civil  society,  the  liberal subject willing to vote in public and then return home  to his private domesticity – can no longer serve as a presup- position of theory or action. Racial, ethnic, and sexual identi- fications  are  similarly  less  fixed,  less  stable,  less  available  as  determinate  subject  positions.  In  their  place,  we  find  fluid,  hybrid, and mobile subjectivities who are undisciplined, who  have not internalized specific norms and constraints, and who  can now only be controlled.  Put  in  psychoanalytic  terms,  symbolic  identity  is  increas- ingly  meaningless  in  the  society  of  control.  What  we  have  instead are imaginary identities sustained by excess jouissance:  that is, by an injunction to enjoy. More specifically, symbolic  identity involves the subject’s identification with an ego ideal:  that is, with a perspective before whom the subject sees himself  and his actions. Imaginary identification refers to the image  that the subject adopts of himself. Symbolic identification, we  might  say,  establishes  the  setting  that  determines  which  images appear and how it is that some are more compelling  or attractive to us than others. Imaginary identification refers  only to my self-image.  C2  DBG_03.indd   76  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  77  In  disciplinary  society,  normative  expectations  coalesced  around  determinate  social  roles.  Presuming  the  gaze  of  the  school, church, family, or state, one could imagine oneself in  different positions, positions that would either comply with or  transgress  institutional  norms.  I  can  be  a  conscientious  student, faithful believer, dutiful daughter, good citizen. And,  I can also be a delinquent, back-sliding, worthless traitor. Even  as the images differ, the symbolic identity of the gaze remains  the  same.  In  the  wake  of  the  decline  of  symbolic  efficiency,  the dissolution of disciplinary society, this gaze loses its prior  force. We aren’t sure if it’s operative, if others believe it: is the  good student a cog, uncreative, thinking inside the box, a goody- two-shoes? Does the Other actually admire and applaud trans- gression,  and  if  so  is  it  then  more  transgressive  not  to  be  transgressive since that’s what the Other wants? Encountering  the  endless  possibilities  of  contemporary  reflexivity,  post-  disciplinary subjects are propelled to move through a variety  of imaginary identities. We imagine ourselves one way, then  another, never sure of how we appear because we don’t know  before whom we appear.  Lacking  the  ability  to  imagine  how  we  appear  to  another,  how another sees us, we lose the capacity to take the position  of another, to see or think from another’s perspective. We can  choose any identity, but we lack the grounds for choosing or  the sense that an identity, once chosen, entails bonds of obliga- tion.20 Rather than following norms – Which ones? How do  they  know?  Who  made  them  the  expert?  –  we  cycle  through  trends, whether these come from fashion, diet advice, or the  hope  for  an  anchor  in  a  particular  subculture.  A  striking  example of the dissolution of norms in the inability to take the  perspective  of  another  is  regularly  performed  on  amateur  talent  shows  like  American  Idol,  Britain’s  Got  Talent,  and  So  You Think You Can Dance? Upon hearing a judge’s negative  assessment  of  his  or  her  performance,  the  contestant  says  something  to  the  effect  of  “Well,  that’s  just  your  opinion;   I  know  I  have  talent.”  The  oddness  is  that  this  response   seems  rooted  in  a  failure  to  understand  the  very  practice  of  judging  and  competition  in  talent  shows.  At  any  rate,  the  society of control places limits on the mobility and fluidity of   C2  DBG_03.indd   77  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   78  Whatever	Blogging  contemporary hybrid identities, but these limits are not those  installed by a Master signifier or symbolic law. To this extent,  they  are  experienced  by  subjects  as  either  groundless  intru- sions,  irrational  barriers  to  enjoyment   the  American  Idol  version: Simon Cowell is simply cruel , or as hypothetical or  instrumental injunctions, as means for achieving enjoyment  later.  Caught  in  reflexive  networks  –  always  another  move,  another  level  –  we  lose  the  capacity  for  reflection.  Our  net- works are reflexive so that we don’t have to be.  We are not bloggers. We are not Facebook. The networked  interactions of communicative capitalism do not provide sym- bolic  identities,  sites  from  which  we  see  ourselves  as  loci  of  collective  action.  Rather,  they  provide  opportunities  for  new  ways for me to imagine myself, a variety of lifestyles that I can  try and try on. This variety and mutability makes my imaginary  identity  extremely  vulnerable  –  the  frames  of  reference  that  give  it  meaning  and  value  are  forever  shifting;  the  others   who  can  rupture  it  might  appear  at  any  moment  and  their  successes,  their  achievements,  their  capacities  to  enjoy  call  mine into question: I could have had more; I could have really  enjoyed.  This  insecurity  is  not  only  psychic;  it’s  a  reasonable  response  to  struggles  to  persist  in  global,  reflexive  financial  and information networks. Most of the economic benefits of  neoliberal  capitalism  –  of  the  new  economy  celebrated  by  digital media gurus – follow a power law distribution. A lucky  few will get nearly everything. Most will get very little, almost  nothing.  Hardt  and  Negri  describe  the  ungovernable,  mobile,  and  fluid singularities arising in the aftermath of disciplinary sub- jectivity  in  terms  of  an  anthropological  exodus.  Hence,  they  emphasize that “those who are against” Empire’s exploitation  and domination “must also continually attempt to construct a  new body and a new life.”21 Communicative capitalism facili- tates  and  incites  these  attempts,  employing  ever  innovative  upgrades to ensure not just that the attempts continue but that  they accelerate. Hardt and Negri acknowledge that the methods  of anthropological exodus are the methods of Empire. But they  don’t accept that their response is also Empire’s: do more, go  further,  radicalize,  create  something  new,  make  tools  into   C2  DBG_03.indd   78  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  79  prostheses,  migrate  and  mutate  into  information  technolo- gies.  They  write,  “The  will  to  be  against  really  needs  a  body  that  is  completely  incapable  of  submitting  to  command.”22  An  undisciplined  body  incapable  of  submission  is  a  body  of  immediacy  and  enjoyment,  driven  to  move  from  image  to  image,  intensity  to  intensity.  Lacking  discipline,  how  can  it  resist,  how  can  it  form  a  will  at  all?  Far  from  constructing  something  new,  such  a  body  forecloses  the  possibility  and  hope of self-governance.  Networked media in the society of control amplify the chal- lenge postfordism poses to collective identity. Yes, they enable  people to sign petitions. Yes, they enable people to give money.  Yes, they enable people to express their opinions. Yes, Obama  had like a million Facebook friends. But these particular motions  of  clicking  and  linking  do  not  produce  symbolic  identities:  they  are  ways  that  I  express  myself  –  just  like  shopping,   checking  my  friends’  updates,  or  following  tabloid  news  at  TMZ.com. I may imagine others like me, a virtual local, but  this local remains one of those like me, my link list or follow- ers, those who fit my demographic profile, my user habits. I  don’t have to posit a collective of others, others with whom I  might  need  to  cooperate  or  struggle,  to  whom  I  might  be  obliged, others who might place demands on me. The instant  connection of networked association allows me to move on as  soon as I am a little uncomfortable, a little put out. Petitions,  social network groups  the one on Facebook that aims to get  a  million  people  to  say  they  oppose  capitalism  has  24,672  members , blogs – they are the political equivalent of just in  time production, quick responses circulating as contributions  to the flows of communicative capitalism. In her compelling  analysis of flash mobs, Cayley Sorochan takes the argument  even further. Countering enthusiastic appropriations of flash  mobs as new instances of democratic engagement, Sorochan  presents them as instances of the “fetishizing of pure partici- pation  removed  from  any  meaningful  political  project.”  She  concludes, “Hopes that flash mobs might represent a future  form  of  political  organization  reflect  a  desire  for  a  politics   of  convenience  where  getting  together  with  others  is  easy   and  does  not  involve  conflict,  commitment  and  struggle.”23   C2  DBG_03.indd   79  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   80  Whatever	Blogging  In  the  circuits  of  communicative  capitalism,  convenience  trumps commitment.  8  Agamben  affiliates  whatever  being  with  the  capitalist  com- modification of the human body and the technologization of  its image in the spectacle.24 The photographic images prolif- erating out of advertising and pornography are “neither generic  nor individual, neither an image of the divinity nor an animal  form.” In them, the body “now became something truly what- ever.” The “whatever” Agamben invokes here suggests a new  approach  to  Guy  Debord’s  society  of  the  spectacle,  one  that  takes back from the spectacle the positive properties of being  in  language  and  being  in  common  that  it  expropriates.  For  Agamben, whatever being is the mode of being in the coming  community. Produced in capitalist spectacle, whatever being  is a harbinger of a better future, one wherein the division held  together in the unity of the spectacle is ultimately overcome.  Because he wants to wrest transformations of human nature  from their entrapment in the spectacle, Agamben suggests as  an apposite image the “geometrical splendor” of the legs of a  long line of dancing girls.  Another  way  to  think  about  the  idea  of  “neither  generic   nor  individual”  is  to  link  it  to  the  normalizing,  aggregating  aspect of disciplinary power. Modern disciplinary institutions,  be they home, school, factory, or state, produced individuals  as  types,  as  occupants  of  social  roles  or  positions.  Recall   photographs of Levittown, of soldiers in training, of graduates  in  their  caps  and  gowns.  The  self-governing,  reflective   subject idealized as the outcome of the disciplines may have  understood  himself  to  be  an  individual,  but  more  than  that,  he  was  an  instance  of  a  form.  Autonomy  appeared  through  individuality.  Agamben associates the planetary petty bourgeoisie with a  frustration  with  and  impropriety  toward  identities  rooted  in  physical particularities or differences in language, tradition, or  culture.  He  concedes  that  fascism  and  Nazism  had  already   C2  DBG_03.indd   80  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  81  recognized  in  the  petty  bourgeoisie  the  “decline  of  the  old  social subject.”25 He jumps quickly over their nationalism as  a false popular identity, though, as he asserts a new planetary  refusal of identity.  With this jump, Agamben omits the mass as a modern col- lective  force  that  is  also  neither  generic  nor  individual.  The  mass is a displaced mediator between the planetary bourgeoi- sie  and  whatever  being.  In  Jean  Baudrillard’s  formulation,  “The  mass  is  without  attribute,  predicate,  quality,  or  refer- ence.”26  Agamben’s  whatever  beings  appear  as  singulariza- tions of the mass. Bereft of qualities of their own, they are not  the  same  as  the  mass  resolved  into  its  components:  masses  were masses of subjects, combinations and aggregations and  accumulations  of  people  across  and  against  modernity’s  attempts to separate and order them. If the mass results from  a combination of bodies that omits their specificities, whatever  being skips the step of amassing to treat the indistinction, the  without-qualities, not as a result of belonging to the mass but  as the condition of belonging as such.  Agamben’s  version  of  co-belonging  inverts  the  political  imaginary  of  radicals  from  the  sixties  and  seventies:  many  feared  erasure,  being  commodified,  being  indistinguishable,  being one of a mass. They rejected the terms of mass society  and mass media, the forced collectivizing of their self-percep- tion  into  the  envelope  of  “us.”  Agamben  accepts  the  mass  without its collective form, thereby reformatting the momen- tary joy of dissolution into a whole as the singularity of belong- ing. Whatever beings do not shed or overcome their identities  in an experience of massness. They already lack them. They  can simply be as they are. The mass is the missing link – dis- placed mediator – the function of which is a chiasmatic inver- sion  of  properties.  Baudrillard  writes,  “Banality,  inertia,  apoliticism used to be fascist; they are in the process of becom- ing  revolutionary  –  without  changing  meaning,  without  ceasing  to  have  meaning.”27  Baudrillard’s  warning  to  leftists  in the seventies hits its target today: how is it that the evacua- tion of politics comes to embody the political as such?  Nevertheless,  for  Agamben  the  petty  bourgeoisie  displace  or stand in for the mass, presenting thereby a new opportunity,   C2  DBG_03.indd   81  4 9 2010   1:36:10 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   82  Whatever	Blogging  an  opportunity  for  a  form  of  belonging  unhindered  by  the  division and specificity of “belonging to”:  Because if instead of continuing to search for a proper identity in  the already improper and senseless form of individuality, human  were  to  succeed  in  belonging  to  this  impropriety  as  such,  in  making of the proper being-thus not an identity and an individual  property but a singularity without identity, a common and abso- lutely exposed singularity – if humans could, that is, not be-thus  in  this  or  that  particular  biography,  but  be  only  the  thus,  their  singular  exteriority  and  their  face,  then  they  would  for  the  first  time enter into a community without presuppositions and without  subjects, into a communication with the incommunicable.28  We have been produced as subjects unlikely to coalesce, sub- jects  resistant  to  solidarity  and  suspicious  of  collectivity.  Central to this production is the cultivation and feeding of a  sense  of  unique  and  special  individuality.  Every  sperm  is  sacred: so began the story of our unique cellular lives. Or, every  potential  genetic  combination  carries  with  it  the  remarkable  potentiality  we  locate  in  our  individuated  selves.  Each  voice  must be heard  but they don’t combine into a chorus . Each  vote must be counted  but they add up to less than a move- ment . Each person must be visible  but then we don’t see a  group .  Personalized  “participatory”  media  is  a  problem  not  only because of its personalization of participation. More than  that is its injunction that we participate ever more in person- alization: make your own avatar, video, profile, blog, mobster,  video, app. Participation becomes indistinguishable from per- sonalization, the continued cultivation of one’s person. Leave  your mark.  What would happen if we just stopped? Agamben’s evoca- tion of singularity and belonging detached from a compulsion  to cultivate an individual identity or to identify with a specific  group opens up the potential for another form of belonging,  one unlimited by the divisions and restrictions of being this  or that. He suggests, moreover, that the beings who would so  belong are not subjects in the sense that European philosophy  or  psychoanalysis  might  theorize.  If  some  sort  of  identity  served as a locus of ethical personality, and the search for this   C2  DBG_03.indd   82  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  83  identity  has  been  configured  as  an  important  ethical  task   perhaps, as some philosophers would have it, the task of each  human life , then whatever beings would emerge as those who  are not subject to such tasks. Unburdened by the obligations  of being this or that, of being bound by choices or words or  expectations of meaning, whatever beings could flow into and  through community without presuppositions.  Agamben  asks  what  the  politics  of  whatever  singularity  could be, what sort of politics could accompany “a being whose  community  is  mediated  not  by  any  condition  of  belonging   being red, being Italian, being Communist  . . .but by belong- ing itself.”29 Because the course of his exposition of whatever  being takes him through Saint Thomas Aquinas and limbo as  the  habitat  of  the  souls  of  unbaptized  children,  the  political  question seems particularly vexing. Those in limbo lack God,  but they don’t suffer from this lack; they know nothing of it:  “Neither blessed like the elected, nor hopeless like the damned,  they are infused with a joy with no outlet.”30 With limbo long  synonymous with a certain stuckness, with an in-between con- dition  of  persistence  that  is  neither  here  nor  there,  with  an  inability to go forward or back, it is difficult to register a poli- tics that we might admire or seek.  More specifically, I can locate here neither a politics I admire  nor any sort of struggle at all. What could motivate whatever  beings?  What  might  move  them?  As  Agamben  conceives  them,  they  seek  nothing,  they  lack  nothing.  They  co-belong  without struggle or antagonism. It would seem, then, that they  are not political beings at all; their being is a-political, beyond  politics. They neither attack nor resist; they are neither inside  nor outside. Perhaps it makes better sense, then, to think of  the politics of whatever beings in terms of their setting. They  are moved and propelled; they circuit through contemporary  networks.  Souls in limbo belong in neither heaven nor hell. This con- dition of belonging to neither is also Agamben’s model for a  politics of absolute enmity toward the state. Agamben writes  that  “a  being  radically  devoid  of  any  representable  identity  would be absolutely irrelevant to the State.”31 And so the state  or,  better,  states  would  continue,  unbothered  and  unlimited   C2  DBG_03.indd   83  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   84  Whatever	Blogging  by the demands of people. States could attack and imprison,  exploit and ignore – the future unfolding in and through mili- tarized predatory robot drones. Whatever beings lack nothing  and therefore demand nothing  and, presumably, they all get  along just fine . No wonder they are irrelevant to the state. The  state can do what it wills. Whatever.  For  Agamben,  however,  rather  than  easing  the  way  for  unchecked state power, whatever being is the “principal enemy  of  the  State.”  The  state,  he  tells  us,  “cannot  tolerate  in  any  way  .  .  .  that  the  singularities  form  a  community  without  affirming an identity, that humans co-belong without any rep- resentable  condition  of  belonging.”32  Leaving  to  the  side  the  question whether this intolerance is a property of the state or  a more complex matter of a human subjectivity that is consti- tutively  split,  it  seems  clear  enough  that  the  state  has  from  time to time tolerated and used the mass, a form of co-belong- ing  without  representable  condition.  The  mass  can  threaten  or support the state, can subvert or sustain it. In Baudrillard’s  conception, for example, the mass is neither a group-subject  nor  an  object.  On  the  one  hand,  the  mass  generally  fails  to  become  a  conscious  revolutionary  force.  On  the  other,  it  refuses attempts to make it speak. Surveys and statistics may  simulate it, but the mass remains ungraspable, particularly as  these very surveys are implicated in the reflexive constitution  of the mass they survey. The absence of the mass, Baudrillard  says, “is nevertheless intolerable.”33 It drives the repetitive pro- cesses of polling and testing. So not only can and has the state  tolerated forms of co-belonging that do not affirm an identity,  but the absence of an identity can itself generate processes of  surveillance  and  incitement-to-speech  useful  for  producing  and maintaining power.  Agamben conceives the spectacle as language or communi- cativity. It is a form for the expropriation of linguistic being,  a  form  that  alienates  people  from  language.  He  works  here  from the dilemma expressed by Debord: in the society of the  spectacle, “the language of real communication has been lost”  and a “new common language has yet to be found.”34 Debord  writes: “Spectacular consumption preserves the old culture in  congealed  form,  going  so  far  as  to  recuperate  and  rediffuse   C2  DBG_03.indd   84  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  85  even  its  negative  manifestations;  in  this  way,  the  spectacle’s  cultural sector gives over expression to what the spectacle is  implicitly in its totality – the communication of the incommuni- cable.”35 Agamben’s response is to turn the problem into the  solution and in so doing find in the spectacle “a positive pos- sibility that can be used against it.”36 Communication of the  incommunicable  dissolves  the  gap  between  them.  It  tells  us  that even the incommunicable can be communicated, that it  cannot be separated. Thus, the spectacle as the extreme expres- sion  of  estrangement  from  linguistic  being  enables  it  own  overcoming.  The  expropriation  of  language  in  the  spectacle  opens up a new experience of language and linguistic being:  “not this or that content of language, but language itself, not  this or that true proposition, but the very fact that one speaks.”37  Failure  to  communicate  provides  its  own  satisfaction,  the  enjoyment of language itself.  In  the  first  chapter,  I  discuss  Žižek’s  account  of  drive  as  loss: drive is loss as itself an object. Agamben’s reflexive treat- ment  of  communication,  his  turn  from  what  is  said  to  that  something  is  said,  employs  this  logic  of  drive.  Not  only  is  a  negative  condition   estrangement  from  linguistic  being   treated  as  a  positive  opening   new  experience  of  belonging ,  but  its  positivity  is  a  result  of  reflexivity.  Language  turns  on  itself.  Encountering  again  the  reflexive  logic  of  drive,  we  get  a  better sense of whatever being, of why it is the kind of being  it is. Insofar as whatever beings experience their own linguistic  being, they turn their attention from the content of language,  from  trying  to  communicate  something,  back  to  themselves  as speaking. They shift from focusing on something outside  or beyond themselves to turning back round upon themselves.  In his discussion of the drive as precisely this turning round  upon the self, Freud views it as a change from activity to pas- sivity.38  The  active  aim,  to  say  something,  is  replaced  by  the  passive aim, to have said. Whatever beings are passive, then,  because they are subjects of drive. The very excesses of their  communicative activity are the form of passivity.  Construing drive as a movement outward and back, Lacan  employs  the  image  of  the  headless  subject.  This  acephalic   C2  DBG_03.indd   85  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   86  Whatever	Blogging  subject of drive “has no relation to the subject other than one  of  topological  community.”  Because  drive  involves  but  one  surface or side of the subject, it isn’t quite right to think of the  “subject” of right as actually a subject. Lacan says that “at this  level, we are not even forced to take into account any subjec- tification of the subject.”39 We’re considering a non-subjectiv- ized subject, one characterized primarily by a lacuna; something  is missing – the head! In fact, Lacan refers to the subject here  as a lacunary apparatus, an apparatus that makes holes or that  makes things turn up missing. The term “apparatus” suggests  that  this  side  of  the  subject,  the  side  of  the  drive,  is  better  conceived as an object. Lacan’s term for this object that pro- vides the other side or fundamental support for the subject is  objet petit a, or loss itself as an object.  Whatever  beings  are  set  in  the  society  of  the  spectacle,  within the conditions of the alienation of language. They are  effects  of  this  expropriation  of  the  commons,  of  a  loss  of  meaning, difference, and individuality that turn this loss into  their condition of belonging. Their setting is one of “the perfect  exteriority  that  communicates  only  itself.”40  Their  setting  is  the reflexive loop of drive.  9  To formalize the ways language provides a set of social links,  Lacan  presents  formulas  for  four  discourses,  those  of  the  Master,  the  hysteric,  the  university,  and  the  analyst.41  Each  discourse  takes  its  name  from  the  figure  that  occupies  the  position of the agent that speaks in that discourse. Thus, the  upper level of the discourse of the analyst is written a – $  objet  a  in  the  position  of  agent,  subject-barred  in  position  of  addressee . The lower level is written S2 – S1  knowledge or the  chain of signifiers in the position of truth and the Master sig- nifier in the position of product or remainder . This lower level  sits directly below the upper level such that a written above S2  and $ is on top of S1.  Žižek  explains  that  in  the  discourse  of  the  analyst,  “the  analyst stands for the paradox of the desubjectivized subject,   C2  DBG_03.indd   86  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  87  of the subject who fully assumes what Lacan calls ‘subjective  destitution,’  that  is,  who  breaks  out  of  the  vicious  cycle  of   the  intersubjective  dialectic  of  desire,  and  turns  into  an   acephalous  being  of  pure  drive.”42  He  concludes  that  the  discourse  of  the  analysis  should  therefore  be  correlated  to  radical-revolutionary  emancipatory  politics.  Insofar  as  the  analyst just sits there in the analytic situation, frustrating the  poor  subject  by  failing  to  provide  it  with  a  clear,  symbolic  place,  the  analyst  is  a  part  that  is  not  a  part  of  the  situation   Žižek takes the term “part of no part” from Jacques Rancière .  After  all,  that’s  why  the  analyst  is  paid  –  to  function  as  an  outside intrusion into the subject’s life.  But  what  about  a  different  reading  of  the  formula  of  the  analyst’s  discourse?  Lacan  notes  that  the  analyst  says  to  the  subject, “Off you go, say everything that comes into your head,  however divided it might be, no matter how clearly it demon- strates that either you are not thinking or else you are nothing  at all, it may work, what you produce will always be admissi- ble.”43 What if we insert this injunction to say whatever comes  to mind in the blogipelago? What if we think of the social link  of the discourse of the analyst as set within a declining sym- bolic order, an order which is barely ordered, where meaning  slips  and  slides,  getting  momentarily  stuck  on  nuggets  of  enjoyment?  If the discourse of the analysis is set within the decline of  symbolic efficiency, then at least three things follow. First, the  subject is desubjectivized or destitute. It is not structured in  terms of symbolic identification so the analyst isn’t function- ing  primarily  as  a  marker  of  the  gap  in  the  symbolic  –  the  instability  of  the  symbolic  has  already  been  assumed,  or  the  symbolic is so riddled with holes and gaps that they no longer  appear as gaps of the Real  the Real cannot appear as such .  Second,  the  object  confronting  and  splitting  the  subject  is  itself  a  surplus  enjoyment  confronting  and  splitting  the  subject, threatening its fragile sense of itself – the stability of  the  Master  is  in  the  position  of  remainder.  Third,  we  have  entered  the  domain  of  drive,  rather  than  desire.  The  analyst  isn’t only a figure of drive, then. The discourse as such persists  in drive.  C2  DBG_03.indd   87  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   88  Whatever	Blogging  Set in drive, the formula for the discourse of the analyst can  be read as a formula for whatever being. The objet a addresses  a subject. It sends a message; it attempts to connect. Knowledge  is in the position of truth  S2 under the bar . But this knowl- edge is anything whatsoever; any sort of content or knowledge  can support the agent speaking object. Experience, mysticism,  common sense, my gut, my opinion – in the absence of exper- tise,  in  the  place  of  the  decline  of  trust  in  so-called  “expert”  knowledge, I can use anything as a support for my view  fully  aware that the fact that anything can be used actually means  nothing can fully ground my position . This problem of any  authority whatsoever appears in the formula: S1, the Master, is  below the bar, under the subject, in the position of production  or remainder. Authority is remaindered, present but inopera- tive, unable to establish meaning.  In the setting of the decline of symbolic efficiency, the part  of no part is not radical. It doesn’t establish a break with the  situation  because  there  is  not  a  situation  that  can  be  set  or  established  as  such.  There  is  also  no  space  for  fantasy   the  formula for fantasy does not appear . Whatever being doesn’t  allow for fantasy; it is premised on its foreclosure.  10  Contemporary networked media perform and repeat commu- nicativity as such, the taking place of language. As applications  for the expression of any idea whatsoever, of an opinion, such  that it is, blogs continue the severing of expressions from their  content  and  their  authors.  Ideas  and  opinions  link  together  and  circulate,  expressions  of  themselves  neither  completely  generic nor completely individual. Posts may link and gesture,  but they don’t represent themselves or anything else. They are  expressions, such that they are. The measuring and counting,  the  hits  and  rankings,  remind  bloggers  that  we  are  set  in  intensive,  reflexive,  communication  and  entertainment  net- works.  It’s  as  if  the  compulsion  to  make  the  mass  speak,  to  poll and survey it, now takes whatever being as its target. Blog  stats  don’t  track  truth  or  meaning.  They  track  blogging,  the   C2  DBG_03.indd   88  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Whatever	Blogging  89  addition of posts, responses, and page views. Differently put,  they track the fact of the spoken as they direct us away from  what is said.  A better instance of language without referent, of language  that refers only to the “it was said,” is the word-cloud, a graphic  representation of the content of a text understood in terms of  frequency of word use. For example, a word-cloud made fol- lowing the first debate between presidential candidates John  McCain and Barack Obama during the 2008 election shows  that  McCain  frequently  used  the  words  “know,”  “spending,”  and “got.” Obama used the words “think,” “make,” and “going.”  He  also  used  the  word  “got”  with  high  frequency.  We  don’t  know what this means. But we do know that words were used  and speeches were made. The irony here is that language as  language  itself,  language  reflected  to  itself  as  language  –  Agamben’s ideal of the coming community – takes the spec- tacular form of the image.  In word-clouds, frequency and proximity displace meaning.  Which words appear with which other words? The combina- tion  of  these  elements  determines  intensity  –  words  that  appear  only  once  either  don’t  count   they  aren’t  counted   or  they  appear  very  faint  and  tiny,  type  as  atmosphere.  Words  matter, not stories and not narratives. Words index communi- cation – they mark that they are being communicated. Word- clouds  shift  away  from  a  space  of  linguistically  constituted  meaning, away from a language constituted out of sentences  that are uttered in contexts according to rules that can be dis- cerned and contested.  What’s lost? The ability to distinguish between contestatory  and hegemonic speech. Irony. Tonality. Normativity – how can  there be an ethics of the address if the words are not part of  an  address,  if  they  are  extracted  from  their  position  within  speech acts to become artifacts and toys? . Critique. The terms  prominent in a discourse can be discerned, but not what they  mean, not even in relation to each other. We don’t know the  rules governing truth and falsity, which may suggest that there  are  no  rules   other  than  those  of  frequency,  proximity,  and  duration . Note that frequency can be citational or monologi- cal: that is, it can come from circulation or from self-repetition.   C2  DBG_03.indd   89  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   90  Whatever	Blogging  Message  force  multipliers  are  more  important  than  the  message. Word-clouds capture the shift from message to con- tribution characteristic of communicative capitalism.  The  word-image  of  the  word-cloud  is  prefigured  in  avant- garde art from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.  Cubists included words as images. Even more disruptive were  the posters from Russian communist and Soviet revolutionary  artists. On the one hand, their word-art was effective because  of its revolutionary impulse, its challenge to the status quo of  late Russian painting. It performed the revolution, disrupting  prior meanings. On the other, precisely because it depended  on its context for its performative efficacy, it reinforced the fact  of  symbolic  meaning.  Its  disruption  was  not  only  to  index  language but to create a new one, to bring about a new world,  a  new  man,  a  new  register  of  meaning.  The  point  wasn’t  to  destroy meaning. It was to change it.  Word-clouds  aren’t  revolutionary.  They  are  elements  of  communicative  capitalism,  elements  that  reinforce  the  col- lapse  of  meaning  and  argument  and  thus  hinder  argument  and opposition. Any words can be clouded. At Wordle you can  make a new one out of speeches from Kennedy and Khrushchev,  Ann Coulter or Sean “Puffy” Combs. Anyone you like.  The  word-cloud  image  doesn’t  stand  in  for  or  provide  a  prosthetic word. It marks a feeling, an intensity. It doesn’t ask  that the viewer understand it. All the viewer is expected to do  is register that the word has been, that it has appeared. The  word  become  image  is  a  feeling-impulse,  like  a  badge.  It’s  identificatory, relying on an identity between word and object.  The word-image is this impulse-identity.  One can’t argue with a word-cloud. It doesn’t take a posi- tion. It marks a moment. It registers aspects of the intensity  of that moment: repetition entails intensity, in this equation.  But one doesn’t know why or whether it’s called for or what  it’s  in  relation  to.  It’s  just  intense.  The  word-cloud  might  transmit the intensity, it might incite a feeling or a response,  but it doesn’t invite the interrogation of that response or what  induced  it.  It  offers  representation  without  understanding:  issues are out there. A word-cloud is like a Möbius strip where  meta-data  become  noise:  “she  said  a  lot  about  politics  and  technology.” Whatever.  C2  DBG_03.indd   90  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   4	 Affective	Networks  1  Why are blogs often portrayed as “inflicted” on the rest of us?  Are  the  “rest  of  us,”  everyone  else  in  the  entire  world,  really  victims of what is written on a single blog, in a single post, in  a single thread? Or has the world somehow become the victim  of  bloggers,  and  not  just  of  some  specific  blog,  blogger,  or  group of bloggers, but bloggers in the abstract? What sort of  world does this anxiety about bloggers presuppose or imagine? The language of victimization in the face of bloggers inflict- ing their boring lives, their obsessive lives, their sex lives, their  pets’ lives on the rest of us differs from the criticism of rabid  political  bloggers  or  snarky  celebrity  bloggers  all  working  ‘round the clock to attack their specific targets and generally  amplify  and  intensify  the  circuits  of  communicative  capital- ism.  The  difference  is  that  the  anxiety  about  victimization  construes  blogging  per  se  as  an  activity  that  victimizes  and  harms  regardless  of  any  particular  content.  The  practice  of  blogging  itself  is  harmful.  Harm  is  an  embedded  feature  of  the application, like a link or tag. Anxiety about blogging relies  on  an  image  of  the  world  as  a  communicative  one,  a  world  wherein communication is ubiquitous and fragile, dangerous  yet  unavoidable.  That  bloggers  are  blogging  is  a  fact  of  this  world that one cannot escape.  The claim that blogging is harmful, that the rest of us are its  victims, thus points to a crucial feature of blogging: it causes  anxiety. Jacques Lacan associates the affect that is anxiety with  jouissance, with the surplus enjoyment he designates as objet  a.1 Although anxiety seems to have no object  and thus differ   C2  91  DBG_04.indd   91  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   92  Affective	Networks  from a fear or phobia , Lacan argues that it has to be approached  in  terms  of  objet  a,  in  terms,  that  is,  of  surplus  enjoyment.  Anxiety about blogging, then, is anxiety about enjoyment.  In the preceding chapter, I presented “whatever being” as  a way to think about contemporary mediated subjects  although  they can just as easily be designated as objects . In this chapter,  I attend to the feedback loops, the circuits of drive, in which  they  are  stuck.  Without  stable  points  of  symbolic  identifica- tion, whatever beings oscillate between the imaginary and the  Real, crafting their ever-adaptable, morphing, identities even  as they remain threatened and vulnerable to the success, pres- ence,  and  enjoyment  of  others.  Communicative  capitalism  commands  us  to  enjoy,  at  the  same  time  that  it  reminds  us  that we aren’t enjoying enough, as much, or as well as others  are. Our enjoyment remains fragile, risky.  Slavoj Žižek describes the way enjoyment constitutes itself  as “stolen,” or as present and possible only insofar as one is  deprived of it.2 I would have read a serious novel, cultivated an  organic garden, driven senior citizens to the polls if I hadn’t gotten  caught up in those stupid blogs. Why are all those people blogging,  anyway?  What  makes  their  lives  and  experiences  so  much  more  interesting than mine? If bloggers weren’t inflicting their stupid  stuff on the rest of us, the rest of us would be enjoying. We  would  be  honing  our  writing,  not  reading  the  half-assed  thoughts of idiots. We’d be making art, not looking at stupid  cat videos. We’d be spending time with our family, not chat- ting with strangers on blogs. Blaming our failure to enjoy on  bloggers  thus  compensates  us  for  our  failure  by  promising  that were it not for the bloggers we would enjoy. Our failure, our  insecurity, is not our fault. The language of infliction rests on  the premise of fragile whatever beings threatened by the pres- ence and enjoyment of others, preoccupied with the worry that  others’  lives  are  more  meaningful  and  fun  than  their  own.  When they read our blogs and discover that our lives are really  not worth the time it took to read about them, then they are  furious, outraged – why did you bloggers waste my time?  The theft of enjoyment positions enjoyment as an object of  desire. Allowing us to fantasize that we would actually prefer  to be reading literary tomes, laboring in a weedy garden, and   C2  DBG_04.indd   92  4 9 2010   1:36:11 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  93  participating  in  a  political  process  designed  to  ensure  that  political change never occurs, it postpones our confrontation  with drive. Confident in what we would prefer to do, if only  we could, we overlook what we are actually doing. There’s no  way I spend three hours a day on Mafia Wars! It’s important for  me to tweet my reaction to the debate! The fantasy of enjoyment  covers over the fact that we are already enjoying, that we get  off,  just  a  little  bit,  in  and  through  our  multiple,  repetitive,  mediated  interactions.  Through  that  fantasy,  we  screen  our- selves from the Real of our enjoyment, the enjoyment that we  can’t avoid, even if we don’t want it.  Blog anxiety, then, expresses our anxiety in the face of our  enjoyment. We are captured doing not what we want but what  we must. The upshot is that we are more entrapped after the  announcement  of  the  death  of  blogging  than  we  ever  were  while  it  ostensibly  lived.  Then  blogging  was  an  alternative.  Now it’s another unavoidable element of our ubiquitous media  setting.  2  German media theorist Friedrich Kittler begins his influential  book Gramophone, Film, Typewriter with optical fiber networks  in order to get to an end: “Before the end, something is coming  to an end.”3 The end, for Kittler, is in part an end of differen- tiation among forms of media storage and transmission; more  specifically, the differentiation between image, text, and voice.  Digitization brings this end about: “Instead of wiring people  and  technologies,  absolute  knowledge  will  be  an  endless  loop.”4 I’ve been describing blogging’s setting in communica- tive  capitalism  in  terms  of  endless  loops.  Kittler’s  “absolute  knowledge” coincides with our confrontation with an inability  to know, our fundamental uncertainty regarding what is hap- pening,  will  happen,  and  has  happened,  a  confrontation  we  experience in and as capture in the repetitive circuits of drive. A non-event on Christmas Day 2009 can illustrate the way  abundant information degenerates possibilities for meaning.  A Nigerian student, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, attempted   C2  DBG_04.indd   93  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   94  Affective	Networks  to  blow  up  Northwest  Airlines  Flight  253  over  the  city  of  Detroit. He was able to get past airport security by hiding the  explosives in his underwear. Coverage of the failed bombing  in the days after it didn’t occur pointed out the numerous clues  that should have alerted officials into preventing Abdulmutallab  from  boarding  the  plane.  These  included  the  fact  that  Abdulmutallab’s father had notified the US Embassy in Nigeria  that  his  son  was  missing  and  likely  under  “the  influence  of  religious extremists based in Yemen,” that he was listed in the  “Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment,” and that a com- munications  intercept  of  Al-Qaeda  followers  in  Yemen  indi- cated that a man named “Umar Farouk” had volunteered for  an  operation.5  Explanations  for  the  security  breach  blamed  “too much information” as well as an inability to access and  analyze the information gathered. All the data in the world – as  if such a fantasy of static completion were even possible – are  useless without a question to cut through and organize them.  Apparently, CIA computer systems “cannot easily search auto- matically – and repeatedly – for possible links.” According to  the Chair of the House Science and Technology Committee’s  Investigation  and  Oversight  Subcommittee,  “Railhead,”  a  program supposed to provide the National Counterterrorism  Center  with  an  integrated  information  infrastructure,  is  plagued by so many design errors that not only does it fail to  connect the dots, “it can’t find the dots.”6  To  return  to  Kittler:  he  treats  the  distinctions  between  image, text, and voice in terms of the Lacanian registers of the  imaginary, Symbolic, and Real. Lacan’s registers, he tells us,  are in fact an historical effect of changes in storage technolo- gies.  The  imaginary  consists  in  the  cuts  and  illusions  that  comprise  fantasies  of  wholeness,  be  they  fantasies  incited  before a mirror or on the screen. The Symbolic is typing, the  machinic word in all its technicity. The Real is recorded sound,  inclusive  of  the  hisses  and  noise  accompanying  the  vocals  produced  by  a  larynx.  Digitization  erases  the  distinctions  between visual, written, and acoustic media. It turns all data  into  numbers  that  can  be  stored,  transmitted,  copied,  com- puted, and rearranged. Taking the place of the material differ- ences providing the basic structure of Lacanian psychoanalysis   C2  DBG_04.indd   94  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  95  is  the  feedback  loop.  Kittler  writes,  “A  simple  feedback  loop  –  and  information  machines  bypass  humans,  their  so-called  inventors.  Computers  themselves  become  subjects.”7  The  codes  and  computations  of  machinic  circuits  thus  herald  an  end, the end of “so-called man.”  Contra Kittler, we’re not there yet – and it doesn’t look like  we’ll get there from here. The affective networks of commu- nicative capitalism indicate that machines are not terminating  humans.  On  the  contrary,  cybernetic  circuits  don’t  exclude  humans  –  they  connect  them   computers  don’t  need  emoti- cons to help them access the feeling of a message . It’s almost  as  if  Kittler  remains  more  of  a  humanist  than  he  wants  to  admit: his technology cryptograms, surface-wave filters, com- putational devices, and fiber-optic cables rest on an underlying  fantasy if only there were a human element.  The  snares  of  communicative  capitalism  persist  in  and  deploy human intensities, all the way to the inhuman dimen- sion of the drives. As Žižek writes, “We become ‘human’ when  we get caught into a closed, self-propelling loop of repeating  the same gesture and finding satisfaction in it.”8 People enjoy  the  circulation  of  affect  that  presents  itself  as  contemporary  communication. The system is intense; it draws us in. Even  when we think we aren’t enjoying, we enjoy  all this email, I  am  so  busy,  so  important;  my  time  is  too  precious  to  waste  on  another  Facebook  game  .  .  .  but  my  score  is  going  up;  it’s  such  a  burden  having  so  many,  many  friends  –  oh,  and  I  should  tweet  about it so they know how busy I am .  Blogs, social networks, Twitter, YouTube: they produce and  circulate affect as a binding technique. Affect, or jouissance in  Lacanian  terms,  is  what  accrues  from  reflexive  communica- tion, from communication for its own sake, from the endless  circular  movement  of  commenting,  adding  notes  and  links,  bringing in new friends and followers, layering and intercon- necting myriad communications platforms and devices. Every  little  tweet  or  comment,  every  forwarded  image  or  petition,  accrues  a  tiny  affective  nugget,  a  little  surplus  enjoyment,  a  smidgen  of  attention  that  attaches  to  it,  making  it  stand  out  from the larger flow before it blends back in. We might find  ourselves more fearful or seem somehow secure, even if we   C2  DBG_04.indd   95  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   96  Affective	Networks  have  no  idea  what  we’re  looking  for  or  what  we’ve  found.  Unable  to  find  a  given  dot,  we  feel,  in  ways  that  exceed  our  conscious  perception,  the  movement  of  multiple  colliding  dots.  These  affective  links  are  stronger  than  hypertextual  ones.  Their resonance remains and continues after specific links are  no longer operative. In flame wars, spam, and critical linking   linking  not  as  a  sign  of  affiliation  but  as  evidence  of  some- thing  awful,  outrageous,  to-be-combated ,  intense  feeling  accompanies and reinforces code. Even failures to forward and  refusals to link have affective impact: Why didn’t she friend me?  Why didn’t he put me on his blogroll? In a world of code, gaps  and omissions can become knots of anxiety.  Affective  attachments  to  media  are  not  in  themselves   sufficient  to  produce  actual  communities  –  bloggers  are   blogging but the blogosphere doesn’t exist. Neither does the  circulation of affect through multiple, networked media imply  stimulus junkies in blank-eyed isolation before their screens.  Affective networks produce feelings of community, or what we  might  call  “community  without  community.”  They  enable  mediated relationships that take a variety of changing, uncer- tain,  and  interconnected  forms  as  they  feed  back  each  upon  the other in ways we can never fully account for or predict. So  while  relations  in  affective  networks  merge  and  diverge  in  ways  resistant  to  formalization,  the  circulation  of  intensities  leaves  traces  we  might  mark  and  follow:  blog  anxiety,  mood  flows  on  Twitter,  military  message  intensification,  irrational  exuberance.  3  2009 was the year of Twitter. Even before the so-called “Twitter  Revolution”  in  Iran   “so-called”  because  US  preoccupation  with tweets occluded the more mundane organizing done with  paper and pencil , Twitter’s 140-character updates were widely  heralded as the next phase of social media, for better or worse.  With  Twitter,  one  can  send  and  receive  messages  to  one’s  network   “followers”   from  either  laptop  or  phone,  thereby   C2  DBG_04.indd   96  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  97  staying in touch with a group while away from the computer.  Twittering – like updates on Facebook – lets users keep con- nected without having to trouble with sending or responding  to individual text messages. Users don’t even need to concern  themselves with specific followers. They can find and follow  updates  by  topic,  a  practice  enabled  by  hashtags,  or  phrases  preceded by the hash sign  the number or pound sign . Rather  than keeping abreast of what Joe is doing, for example, I can  track tweets on specific issues.  By 2009, politicians and celebrities seemed to be tweeting  their  every  move   some  US  members  of  Congress  tweeted  during  President  Barack  Obama’s  first  State  of  the  Union  address . Their tweets were archived and circulated, perpetual  reminders of the inanity of these momentary updates. Large  websites  and  blogs  began  to  feature  twitter  rooms,  pages  of  twittered  posts  grouped  thematically  by  poster   journalist,  celebrity,  right-wing  political  operative .  Non-politicians  and  non-celebrities  also  tweeted.  Even  when  our  tweets  weren’t  followed by more than a couple of hundred people, it still felt  like something to issue updates and statements.  Not  surprisingly,  commentary  was  mixed.  For  Alexander  Zaitchik,  Twitter  feeds  a  growing  “constant-contact  media  addiction, birdlike attention-span compression, and vapidity to  the point of depravity.” What happens when the communica- tion  standard  is  140  characters?  What  comes  next?  “Seventy  characters?  Twenty?  The  disappearance  of  words  altogether,  replaced by smiley-face and cranky-crab emoticons?”9 Wired’s  Clive  Thompson  is  more  enthusiastic,  in  a  “bright  side  of  crack” sort of way. An early adopter, Thompson was already  celebrating  the  “stupefyingly  trivial”  aspect  of  Twitter  in  the  summer of 2007.10 For him, multiple, mindless updates result  in  something  more,  a  kind  of  ambient  awareness  or  “social  proprioception.”  They  have  a  cumulative  effect,  producing  a  sense of others’ everyday lives and feelings.  Lauren Berlant describes Facebook’s news feed:  Facebook is about calibrating the difficulty of knowing the impor- tance of the ordinary event. People are trying there to eventalize  the  mood,  the  inclination,  the  thing  that  just  happened  –  the   C2  DBG_04.indd   97  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   98  Affective	Networks  episodic nature of existence. So and so is in a mood right now.  So and so likes this kind of thing right now; and just went here  and there. This is how they felt about it. It’s not in the idiom of  the  great  encounter  or  the  great  passion,  it’s  the  lightness  and  play of the poke.11  Like  a  tweet,  a  Facebook  update  marks  the  mundane  by  expressing it, by breaking it out of one flow of experience and  introducing it into another. Now part of a shifting screen of  comments and images, the mundane moment tags a mood or  sensibility.  Differently  put,  because  updates  are  aspects  of  a  practice, singular moments among many such moments, they  both contribute to an affective flow and mark divergences from  it.  Little  moment-to-moment  reports  suggest  the  pattern  of  changes in one’s feelings about one’s life, what is worth noting  and  why.  The  flow  is  the  result  of  these  multiple  offerings,  back  and  forth,  up  and  down,  on  and  on.  The  feel  of  the  updates arises out of their setting, a setting that is a little dif- ferent for everyone – not all your friends are mine. The fact of  uttering, of adding in, displaces the content of any one utter- ance. The flow of tweets transmits what exceeds any specific  tweet: that is, a broader, less tangible, more general mood. One  even gets accustomed to overlooking tweets in their singular- ity, enjoying instead getting swept into their flow.  By  the  summer  of  2009,  a  study  of  11.5  million  Twitter  accounts showed that the ambient awareness of Twitter was  heavily  tilted  toward  a  small  number  of  super  users  and  a  bunch of automated zombies.12 Just 5 percent of the accounts  were generating 75 percent of the tweets – another example of  power  laws  on  the  web   the  authors  of  the  report  refer  to  Twitter’s “hockey-stick-like growth” .13 Likewise, while about 1  percent  of  users  tweeted  ten  or  more  times  a  day,  over  85  percent tweeted less than once a day  and half hadn’t updated  in  over  a  week   –  a  finding  hardly  suggestive  of  an  environ- ment  where  one  starts  to  sense  the  rhythms  and  feelings  of  the  lives  of  others  .  .  .  unless,  of  course,  the  others  in  one’s  environment are marketers, advertisers, and automated bots.  We  were  sensing  not  just  networked  generated  moods,  not  just  the  multiplication  of  the  feedback  effects  of  our  tweets,   C2  DBG_04.indd   98  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  99  but the directed channeling and amplification of some streams  over  and  against  others.  The  Sysomos  study  found  that  24  percent of the tweets were coming from automated bots, feeds  from  elsewhere  on  the  net,  like  Second  Life   2,000-plus  updates per day from this virtual world  or Dogbook  Facebook  for dogs . It also determined that “social media marketers are  far more active than overall users.”14 Perhaps Twitter tags the  reflexivity of contemporary media networks as they turn back  upon themselves.  4  One of the numerous scandals extending out of and around  George  W.  Bush’s  aggressive  war  against  Iraq  involved  the  Pentagon’s organization of former generals as media talking  heads.  Not  only  did  these  “military  analysts”  advocate  war,  parroting  administration  talking  points,  but  many  were  also  tied  to  the  defense  industry  as  executives,  consultants,  and  board members.15 According to the New York Times, “Internal  Pentagon documents repeatedly refer to the military analysts  as  ‘message  force  multipliers’  or  ‘surrogates’  who  could  be  counted on to deliver administration ‘themes and messages’  to  millions  of  Americans  ‘in  the  form  of  their  own  opin- ions.’ ”16 The term “message force multipliers” suggests one of  the ways that state political power operates under communica- tive capitalism.  I say “suggests” because the term “message force multipli- ers” can be accented in at least two ways: the force multiplica- tion  of  messages  or  the  multiplication  of  message  forces.  Force multiplication indexes a communications strategy for a  complex media environment. It implies adding lots of forces,  putting more people on the ground or on the air, just as one  would  send  more  troops  into  a  situation.  It’s  like  spam  for  television – which is not the same as propaganda. The term  “propaganda” isn’t useful in an age of constant media, ever- present advertising, unavoidable spin. The government’s pro- vision  of  forces  differs  from  spam  on  the  internet,  though,  because  it’s  spam  by  request  –  television  news  shows  invite   C2  DBG_04.indd   99  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   100  Affective	Networks  the  military  analysts  to  appear  and  analyze  what’s  going  on.  In  this  way,  the  mainstream,  commercial  media   including  large  right-wing  blogs   ask  to  be  bearers  of  the  administra- tion’s media. They set themselves up to be its tools, its voice  – when they aren’t, they lose what they understand as access  to power, to “the story.” News, then, is what the administration  reports, and the mainstream media are the neutral vehicle –  medium – for it  as if they had no responsibility for the practice  formerly  known  as  “journalism” .  In  psychoanalytic  terms,  this  instrumental  relation  is  perverse.  Media  position  them- selves as the means for others’ enjoyment, whether that enjoy- ment is the administration’s or, more likely, their sponsors’.  “Multiplication  of  message  forces”  indicates  a  concrete  awareness of the affective dimension of media in communica- tive capitalism. The Bush administration excelled in excepting  itself from the signifying aspect of language and relying instead  on affective prompts. It absorbed the lesson from advertising  and pop music: repetition exerts a force, a compulsion; repeti- tion has effects independent of the meaning of what is repeated.  Repetition itself has an affective impact – a sexualizing pulsa- tion, a threatening intrusion, a hilarious extreme. State politics  in  the  twenty-first  century  in  the  US,  UK,  and  Europe  has  become  ever  more  adept  at  tying  together  previously  stable  meanings in ways that rely on and at the same time disrupt  these meanings. This combination of reliance and disruption  generates affective responses from the tension accompanying  the combustion of meaning and non-meaning.  The  combination  also  suggests  a  tactical  appreciation  for  contemporary  short  attention  spans.  With  multiple  message  forces, one can keep a message alive on one terrain even as it  dwindles in another – a role at which blogs excel. Issues that  seem  to  have  died  can  reanimate:  mainstream  journalists  report, “bloggers are debating  .  .  .” or “as was recently uncov- ered  by  blog  X.  .  .  .”  The  idea  of  multiplying  message  forces  highlights  how  messages  carry  affective  charges.  The  com- munications  strategy  on  which  it  is  based  doesn’t  turn  on  “getting our message out there,” as if there were to be a debate  on  positions  that  need  to  be  understood  and  considered.  Rather, the goal is spreading, diversifying, and intensifying the   C2  DBG_04.indd   100  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  101  message  force.  Abundant,  dispersed,  mashed-up  messages  thus displace previous communication strategies focused on  direct  image  control.  Even  when  facts  are  corrected,  fictions  remain,  repeated  and  circulated  in  affective  networks.  The  generals  were  vehicles  for  this  spreading  and  distributing  –  message force genbots.  My  account  here  shares  elements  of  Tiziana  Terranova’s  description of informational culture. She writes, “an informa- tional culture marks the point where meaningful experiences  are under siege, continuously undermined by a proliferation  of  signs  that  have  no  reference,  only  statistical  patterns  of  frequency, redundancy and resonance  the obsessive frequency  and  redundancy  of  an  advertising  campaign,  the  mutually  reinforcing resonance of self-help manuals and expert advice,  the incessant bombardment of signifying influences .”17 Such  a  media  environment  could  be  read  in  information  theory’s  oppositional categories of signal and noise. This reading would  indicate that the way to get one’s message across would be to  eliminate noise and establish a clear channel of communica- tion   perhaps  by  “going  over  the  heads”  of  the  media  and  “speaking directly to the people” . Terranova rightly eschews  the binary of signal and noise, arguing instead for the turbu- lent  materiality  of  communication  wherein  information  as  such relies on “distracted perception.” For example, architec- ture and design induce bodily habits directly implicated in the  processing  of  information.  Signal  and  noise,  then,  not  only  exert  reciprocal  effects  on  each  other  but  are  implicated  in  feedback  processes  in  the  environments  out  of  and  through  which they are generated, transmitted, and received.  Terranova’s discussion is persuasive and surely right: infor- mation  is  more  than  the  delivery  of  a  coded  signal.  Yet  her  jump to the active, material, dimensions of information relies  on  two  omissions.  The  first  is  the  split  within  a  message  between its content and the fact of its being sent, what I call  its “contribution”  and what Lacanian psychoanalysis treats in  terms of the enunciated and the enunciation .18 The recipient  of  a  message  can  ask,  “What  does  this  mean?,”  attending  thereby to a message’s content. She can also ask, “Why are you  sending  me  this?,”  drawing  out  the  deliverer’s  purpose  or   C2  DBG_04.indd   101  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   102  Affective	Networks  intent,  what  the  deliverer  aims  to  contribute  by  sending  the  message.  Terranova,  explicating  key  debates  in  information  theory, omits this doubling of the utterance into content and  contribution, noting that communication at its most minimal  depends on the establishment of a clear channel. For informa- tion  theorists  such  as  Claude  E.  Shannon,  it  simply  doesn’t  matter who is sending and receiving.  Terranova’s  omission,  while  responsive  to  information  theory, occludes a key feature of networked communication:  the  displacement  of  content  by  contribution  –  more  specifi- cally, by communication for its own sake. Contemporary affec- tive  networks  rely  on  the  marking,  adding,  forwarding,  and  circulating of messages not because doing so “means” some- thing  but  simply  to  communicate.  As  with  Cicero’s  causerie,  described in chapter 2, contemporary communication is what- ever communication, the communication of communicativity.  Tweets,  Facebook  updates,  images  of  cute  kitties,  text  mes- sages – these media of affective flow can be limited neither to  their  content  nor  to  their  materiality.  Understanding  them  requires attending to their doubling as message and contribu- tion and grappling with the ways that the latter’s displacement  of  the  former  amplifies  the  chaotic,  intensive,  circulation  of  enjoyment  even  as  it  diminishes  the  impact  of  any  single  contribution.  The  second  omission  effected  by  Terranova’s  jump  to  a  materiality rendered as chairs and keyboards, bottles and tele- phones is its neglect of the materiality already at play in per- ceiving. Perception as such is “distracted,” contorted around a  stain or gap. As I discuss in chapter 2, one of the ways Lacanian  psychoanalysis  theorizes  this  gap  in  terms  of  the  gaze.  This  concept designates the way that one’s perceptions are always  partial and incomplete. As we fill them in, we infuse our per- ceptions with inadequacies and distortions.19 For example, the  subject might fill in what he wants to see; his desire may fill  in the gaps he encounters. He may then become aware of such  a  gap,  and  his  involvement  in  it,  turning  his  attention  from  the object of perception to himself as perceiver. The point is  that perceiving requires attending to some aspects of a setting  rather than others, even as that attending may be involuntary,   C2  DBG_04.indd   102  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  103  compelled  by  an  element  in  a  situation,  unconscious,  or  a  deliberate  effort  at  focusing  one’s  attention  on  one’s  breath  rather than on the multiple stresses of one’s day.  As  a  tactic  in  the  Bush  administration’s  communications  strategy,  message  force  multipliers  presuppose  both  the  dis- placement of content by contributions and distracted percep- tion.  They  thrive,  in  other  words,  not  in  a  closed  media  environment but in the open, distributed, recombinant, chaotic  feedback  loops  of  affective  networks.  In  contrast  to  a  state  politics waged through message force multipliers, Terranova  claims  that  opinion  polls,  surveys,  and  risk  assessments  are  “the most effective and concise modality of information trans- mission today.”20 Her response is to advocate a “cultural poli- tics of information.”  One component of a cultural politics of information would  posit “radically other codes and channels.” Although the very  notion of “radically other” makes it impossible to imagine or  assess such codes and channels  if they could be imagined or  assessed,  they  wouldn’t  be  “radically”  other  but  would  be  in  some relation to our current setting; likewise, insofar as they  are “radically other,” their political implications are unknow- able , Terranova’s suggestion could be valuable. Yet her analy- sis is premised on a too quick mapping of information theory  onto  information  politics.  Under  communicative  capitalism,  an excess of polls, surveys, and assessments circulates, under- cutting not only the efficacy of any particular poll or survey but  the conditions of possibility for knowledge and credibility as  such. There is always another survey, done by another group  or association with whatever bias and whatever methodology,  displacing whatever information one thought one had.  Another component of Terranova’s cultural politics of infor- mation  would  pursue  digitalizing  tendencies  to  decompose  and recombine, tendencies she associates with montage  via  the work of Pierre Lévy . Given Lacan’s association of montage  with  the  drive  and  the  repetitive  jumping  among  heteroge- neous  elements,  decomposition  and  recombination  appear  more as aspects of our capture in affective networks than as  tactics  of  resistance.  Differently  put,  drive  as  montage  indi- cates  how  media  tactics  of  resistance  such  as  mash-ups  and   C2  DBG_04.indd   103  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   104  Affective	Networks  remixes  are  already  captured:  not  only  do  they  contribute  to  the ever-circulating flow, amplifying the intensity of the very  elements they seek critically to recombine, but in presuming  the  efficacy  of  a  politics  of  meaning  they  displace  attention  from the fact that the multiple elements of our contemporary  media  ecology  are  already  fragments  and  parts  ready  for  recombination.  The  politics  that  montage  suggests  is  a  politics  released  from burdens of coherence and consistency. It needs neither  theme nor message but can rely on questions and repetitions.  It is not a politics that relies on “the intensity of the image and  the afterlife that such intensities carry” but one that has already  challenged  and  undercut,  remastered,  recontextualized,  and  mashed-up innumerable uploaded and recirculated images.21  Understood in terms of drive, montage clicks on a politics that  exceeds the constraints of narrative, appearing as a combina- tion of disparate images shifting and mutating without begin- ning  or  end,  head  or  tail.  In  the  setting  of  communicative  capitalism, we might also think of such a politics in terms of  links  and  windows,  text  messages  and  blog  posts,  contribu- tions to the flows into which any addition is absorbed. What’s  clear is that far from a left-wing political application, montage  is well suited to a political Right, in both its neoliberal and its  neoconservative guise, insofar as this Right thrives on uncer- tainty, insecurity, and turbulence as easing the flow of affective  intensities  and  consolidating  our  capture  in  the  networks  of  drive.  5  More than a decade before his famous recantation of the ideol- ogy  that  had  guided  his  life   and  brought  global  financial  markets to their knees , Alan Greenspan, then chair of the US  Federal  Reserve  Board,  gave  a  speech  at  the  American  Enterprise Institute where he was being honored with a pres- tigious award. Entitled “The Challenge of Central Banking in  a Democratic Society,” the speech outlined the history of the  Federal  Reserve,  particularly  with  regard  to  maintaining  the   C2  DBG_04.indd   104  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  105  purchasing power of money. Greenspan pointed out the dif- ficulties with inflation and unemployment in the 1970s, credit- ing a turn away from Keynesianism and toward monetarism  as  key  to  remedying  those  economic  problems.  Yet  he  also  confronted an emerging non-knowledge or loss in knowledge  at the level of the economy.  Greenspan  noted  the  complexity  of  “pinning  down  the  notion  of  what  constitutes  a  stable  general  price  level.”  If  prices  are  necessary  for  measuring  inflation,  which  prices  matter?  Do  escalating  stock  and  real  estate  prices  pose  a  problem to economic stability? What about “the price of a unit  of software or a legal opinion”? The combination of informa- tization and the post-industrial shift toward the service sector’s  increased  role  in  the  economy  eluded  the  standard  mecha- nisms for assessing changes in prices and hence inflation.  Technology  figures  heavily  in  Greenspan’s  speech.  The  Chairman  mentioned  costly  equipment  expenditures  associ- ated  with  increasing  the  safety  and  reliability  of  electronic  payments: “like a breakdown in an electric power grid, small  mishaps create large problems.” As if foreshadowing the eco- nomic  débâcle  that  would  cascade  from  the  collapse  of  the  investment banking firm Lehman Brothers twelve years later,  Greenspan observed as well the risks associated with financial  interconnectivity, “the failure of a single institution will rico- chet  around  the  world,  shutting  down  much  of  the  world’s  payments system.”  Most  of  the  press  on  his  speech,  though,  highlighted  his  gesture to the booming stock market  the Dow Jones Industrial  Average had risen nearly 3,000 points over the preceding two  years , a rise seemingly driven by internet stocks, despite the  fact that no information technologies were yet included in the  Dow: “how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly  escalated asset values?”22  The  dotcom  bubble  didn’t  burst  for  four  more  years.  It  intensified and expanded. Not only did the Dow rise another  5,000 points, but stocks, markets, and investing infused US  popular  culture,  becoming  intense  attractors  of  interest  and  attention.  For  some,  including  Greenspan,  the  key  factor  behind  the  market  boom  was  the  fact  that  the  country  had   C2  DBG_04.indd   105  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   106  Affective	Networks  entered into a “new era.” Technology and competition created  new opportunities for prosperity and growth – indeed, whole  new ways of conceptualizing prosperity and growth. For others,  that increases in corporate earnings in the mid-nineties coin- cided with popular uptake of the internet  the Mosaic browser  was released in 1994; the internet backbone was fully pushed  into the private sector by 1995  did not mean that computers  and  the  internet  themselves  caused  the  increases.23  Most  of  the internet companies – despite their extraordinarily success- ful initial public stock offerings – were not themselves making  a profit.  Still, the internet felt profitable. It felt new, exciting, innova- tive. Greenspan emphasized “awesome changes.”24 Net cheer- leaders like Wired editor Kevin Kelly celebrated the expansion  in  opportunities  ushered  in  by  the  net,  an  expansion so  sig- nificant that firms could stop thinking in traditional economy  terms like productivity and problem-solving. More important  were  conversations,  relationships,  networks,  all  of  which  amplified  value   even  if  this  value  couldn’t  be  quantified  or  monetized .  Kelly  thus  emphasized  ever-extending  feedback  loops: “each actualization of an idea supplies room for more  technology, and each new technology supplies room for more  ideas. They feed on each other, rounding faster and faster.”25 Critics,  also  identifying  the  internet  with  feedback  loops,  saw the booming stock market not as proof of a new economic  era  but  of  a  speculative  bubble  with  its  own  self-fulfilling  momentum.  Where  Kelly  perceived  “opportunity  cascades,”  economist Robert Shiller saw “information cascades”: that is,  people – investors – taking a kind of information short-cut by  assuming that what everyone else is doing must be right.26 For  example,  if  we  believe  our  friends  are  on  Facebook,  we  will  join.  Even  if  our  friends  aren’t  there  yet,  after  we’ve  joined,  they will, too. During the dotcom bubble of the nineties, herd  behavior, copying the actions of others, started to make sense  –  in  fact,  not  doing  so  when  all  these  others  seemed  to  be  becoming millionaires felt irrational, like being left behind, a  dupe and a sucker.  Applying  George  Soros’s  theory  of  reflexivity  in  financial  markets  described in chapter 1 , John Cassidy argues that the   C2  DBG_04.indd   106  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  107  reflexive process of the nineties bubble was most powerful in  the technology sector.27 The same technology on which people  were speculating was enabling ever more speculation. America  Online, CompuServe and E*Trade allowed independent inves- tors to trade online  by 1999 over five million US households  had online trading accounts .28 Likewise, computer-linked day  traders  there were over sixty day trading firms in 1999  quickly  bought and sold stocks as they tried to profit from small shifts  in price.29 Both groups relied not only on networked trading  but also on the ever-increasing deluge of financial information  –  cable  news,  financial  chat  rooms,  close  to  real-time  share  prices.  Exchanges  of  tips  and  opinions  amplified  both  the  popular feeling that money was being made and the individual  sense that one had the information necessary to join right in.  Using internet technologies to make money seemed to prove  that the technologies themselves were money-makers, money- makers without limit, even when, especially when, the actual  companies showed no profits and quickly burnt through their  venture  capital.  Some  of  the  more  spectacular  collapses  included  Pets.com   which  lost  over  $100  million   and  eToys   with debts over $270 million .  The  rapid,  expanding,  intensifying  circulation  of  informa- tion and capital traced a loop around a change in knowledge.  Not only did the speculative bubble indicate that markets could  be irrational, that prices could well be the outcome of irrational  exuberance, and that people would speculate on the fact that  predicting exactly when the bubble would burst was impossi- ble, but the information superhighway didn’t seem to provide  much information. The issue is not the typical lament regard- ing  search  engines  and  filters.  It’s  the  fact  of  fundamental  non-knowledge  and  uncertainty.  Even  Wired  editor  and  network propagandist Kevin Kelly acknowledges this point as  he urges his readers to jump, act, risk, move – anything can  be an opportunity; one doesn’t know what will work, what will  fail.  Tucked  at  the  very  end  of  his  New  Rules  for  the  New  Economy is Kelly’s version of the decline of symbolic efficiency:  “Because the nature of the network economy seeds disequilib- rium,  fragmentation,  uncertainty,  churn,  and  relativism,  the  anchors  of  meaning  and  value  are  in  short  supply.  We  are   C2  DBG_04.indd   107  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   108  Affective	Networks  simply unable to deal with questions that cannot be answered  by means of technology.”30  A  decade  after  the  dotcom  bust,  the  so-called  “advanced”  economies confronted the even more extreme and devastating  collapse of the credit, mortgage, and finance markets, again in  the wake of a massive bubble of irrational exuberance. Investors  had  convinced  themselves  that  they  had  the  mathematical  formulae and computing skills necessary to shield themselves  from risk, neglecting the fact that “when enough people sub- scribe to a particular means of taming financial risks, then that  itself  brings  new  risk.”31  Barely  three  months  before  the  col- lapse  of  Lehman  Brothers  ushered  in  a  “once  in  a  century”  financial  and  economic  calamity,  another  Wired  editor  embraced and exaggerated Kelly’s point about our inability to  deal  with  questions  that  can’t  be  answered  through  technol- ogy. Chris Anderson pronounced that such questions need not  even be asked – the “data deluge” makes science and theory  obsolete: “This is a world where massive amounts of data and  applied  mathematics  replace  every  other  tool  that  might  be  brought  to  bear.  Out  with  every  theory  of  human  behavior,  from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology, and  psychology.”32 Neglecting the ways human behavior leads not  just  to  bubbles  but  to  the  rational  irrationality  of  short-term  investments  precisely  because  everyone  else  is  doing  it  con- tributes mightily to extreme fluctuations in financial markets,  at  great  human  cost   estimates  of  the  loss  of  wealth  in  the  2008–9 crisis exceed ten trillion dollars . Anderson similarly  ignores  how  interpretations  of  data  both  shape  data  and  are  themselves  also  data.  Differently  put,  he  omits  the  fact  that  interpretations of behavior influence behavior. This neglect of  feedback  is  particularly  shocking  coming  from  an  editor  of  Wired.  6  C2  In his Comments on the Society of the Spectacle, published twenty  years after The Society of the Spectacle, Guy Debord offers the  notion of the “integrated spectacle” as the highest stage of the   DBG_04.indd   108  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  109  spectacular  society.  Although  he  doesn’t  describe  the  inte- grated  spectacle  as  a  reflexive  circuit  or  as  the  spectacle’s  turning in upon itself, such reflexivity seems to be its primary  conceptual innovation. Debord writes, “For the final sense of  the  integrated  spectacle  is  this  –  that  it  has  integrated  itself  into reality to the same extent as it was describing it, and that  it was reconstructing it as it was describing it. As a result, this  reality no longer confronts the integrated spectacle as some- thing  alien.”33  The  integrated  spectacle  is  an  element  of  the  world it depicts; it is part of the scene upon which it looks. It  is a circuit.  Debord  misses  the  circuitry  of  the  integrated  spectacle  because his account of the spectacle is embedded in a model  of  broadcast  media.  His  arguments  thus  proceed  as  if  the  problem of the spectacle remained, for all its dispersion, ulti- mately a matter of top-down control, of actors and spectators.  Debord  worries  about  images  as  the  individual’s  “principal  connection to the world.” The problem, though, isn’t with the  image’s displacement of language and critical thought or even  with  its  commodity-function.  Rather,  Debord’s  worry  stems  from the fact that the images the spectator sees are “chosen  and constructed by someone else.”34 When “chosen by someone  else” is the problem, the solution seems like it can be found  in choosing and constructing for oneself – and maybe with cool  Free  Software,  or  with  photo  and  video  uploading  and  sharing  capabilities: freedom through Apple and Flickr. If the problem of  the image is that it comes from “someone else,” then participa- tory technology is the solution. Anyone who makes her own  images is a threat, a radical, a revolutionary. But this solution  leaves out underlying questions of access and ownership, not  to mention the fundamental trap of an ever-intensifying image  environment  as  more  and  more  of  us  upload  videos  to  YouTube.  Debord  suggests  that  in  the  spectacular  society,  “those  who  control  information”  can  alter  at  will  individual  reputations. He doesn’t consider what changes when we alter  our images ourselves  I should have never posted those party pics  on Facebook! . He can’t allow, in other words, for the possibility  that in choosing for ourselves, in participating in the produc- tion of the spectacle, we might contribute to our own capture.  C2  DBG_04.indd   109  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   110  Affective	Networks  Discussion  poses  a  problem  similar  to  the  manipulated  image.  Debord  claims  that  “spectacular  discourse  leaves  no  room  for  any  reply.”35  This  doesn’t  apply  to  contemporary  networked information and entertainment media: it’s easy to  “reply all” – although these replies, like the others circulating  around and through us, don’t feel like responses; they are just  more contributions to be deleted, stored, or forwarded. Debord  writes that people have “never been less entitled to make their  opinions  heard.”36  Again,  under  communicative  capitalism,  the  opposite  is  the  case.  Everyone  not  only  has  a  right  to  express an opinion, but each is positively enjoined to – vote,  text, comment, share, blog. Constant communication is an obli- gation. Every interaction, transaction, inaction, reaction is con- strued in terms of a conversation. Debord rightly emphasizes  the repetition constitutive of the spectacle. Arguments in the  spectacle  prove  themselves  “by  going  round  in  circles,”  “by  coming  back  to  the  start.”  Yet  he  laments  that  “there  is  no  place left where people can discuss the realities which concern  them.’ ”37 Today people discuss the realities that concern them  everywhere and all the time – blogs, Facebook, Twitter, they  ooze with the realities of individual concern. Talk. Talk. Talk.  Discussion,  far  from  displaced,  has  itself  become  a  barrier  against acts as action is perpetually postponed. What appears  as  an  exchange  of  reasons  is  a  vehicle  for  the  circulation  of  affects.  The  lack  of  action  is  the  abundance  of  discussion  viewed from a different angle.  Debord criticizes the experts who serve the media and state,  experts he presents as falsifiers and fools. His argument, again  reinforcing an underlying assumption that participatory media  technologies  might  prove  a  way  out  of  spectacular  society,  relies on a faith in amateurs, in ordinary people, individuals  with the “capacity to see things for themselves.”38 Insofar as  Debord’s critique positions professionals as completely bound  to the spectacular state, it relies on a suspicion toward exper- tise. Not only can expert knowledge not be trusted, but there  is  really  no  such  thing  as  expertise:  “the  ability  to  falsify  is  unlimited.”39 Failing to follow his argument to the end, Debord  implies that non-expert knowledge necessarily brings with it  capacities for resistance and transgression. This may be true   C2  DBG_04.indd   110  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  111  under mass media, particularly in the case of censorious mass  media.  In  the  setting  of  communicative  capitalism,  another  name for the impossibility of expertise, for falsification without  limit, is the decline of symbolic efficiency. How do we know  whom to believe or trust? Suspicion or even uncertainty toward  expertise goes all the way down: skepticism toward politicians  and  the  media,  scientists  and  academics,  extends  to  local  knowledges,  knowledges  rooted  in  experience,  and  anything  at all appearing on the internet. Not only has amateurism and  gut-level or street knowledge supplanted what was previously  considered  expertise,  but  even  amateur  and  everyday  knowl- edge  is  now  rejected  as  nothing  more  than  opinion,  and  opinion which is necessarily limited, biased, and countered by  others. The ability to falsify is unlimited. The lack of a capacity  to know is the other side of the abundance of knowledge.  Finally,  correlative  to  the  embeddedness  of  Debord’s  cri- tique of the image, discussion, and expertise in mass media is  his  presumption  that  the  spectacle  is  a  form  of  state  power,  that  it  is  a  vehicle  for  mastery  over  the  people.  Understood  reflexively, constant, pervasive communication can be a regime  of control in which the people willingly and happily report on  their  views  and  activities  and  stalk  their  friends.  Networked  whatever  beings  don’t  need  spectacles  staged  by  politicians  and the mass media. We can make and be our own spectacles  – and this is much more entertaining. There is always some- thing new on the internet. Corporate and state power need not  go  to  the  expense  and  trouble  to  keep  people  entertained,  passive,  and  diverted.  We  prefer  to  do  that  ourselves.  Mark  Andrejevic’s  analysis  of  the  constellation  of  voyeurism  and  self-disclosure in interactive media  his focus is on the reality  television  message  boards  Television  Without  Pity   persua- sively demonstrates the ways even dismissive, critical engage- ment with television binds viewers more closely to the shows  they claim to hate. The result, he argues, is a “reflexive redou- bling  that  amounts  to  an  active  form  of  self-submission.”40  Networked, participatory spectacles let us stage and perform  our own entrapment.  Debord provides a helpful list of the features of society at   the stage of the integrated spectacle:  C2  DBG_04.indd   111  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   112  Affective	Networks  1   Incessant technological renewal  which surrenders every- one to the mercy of specialists .  2  Integration of state and economy. 3  Generalized secrecy. 4  Unanswerable lies  have eliminated public opinion which   has lost the ability to make itself heard .  5  An eternal present.41  I offer the following alterations as a way of upgrading Debord  for communicative capitalism:  1   Incessant technological renewal  which contributes to the  production of amateurs and a sense that no specialist ever  really knows .  2  Neoliberalization of governance  the state uses it power to  maintain  inequality,  supporting  the  privilege  of  financial  elites;  Debord’s  account  remains  bound  to  a  critique  of  technocracy and the welfare state .  3  Generalized publicity  revelation and disconcealment: for  example, the US government can admit to torture and face  no significant repercussions .  4  A decreasing ability to distinguish between truth and lies,  a  decline  of  a  politics  where  truth  matters   collapse  of  symbolic efficiency .  5  A focus on what’s next, prediction, forecasting, the biggest   thing after the next biggest thing.  Debord’s claim that, in the society of the spectacle, “the uses  of media guarantee a kind of eternity of noisy insignificance”  applies better to communicative capitalism as a disintegrated,  networked, spectacular circuit.42 Key to this circulation is the  fact that networks are not only networks of computers, proto- cological and fiber-optic networks. They are also affective net- works capturing people.  If we revisit the discussion of Agamben from the preceding  chapter, we recall that the spectacle returns us to our linguistic  nature in an inverted fashion. The spectacle contains and cap- tures the possibility of a common good. We could even say its  production of a common is its good or that the power of spec-  C2  DBG_04.indd   112  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  113  tacle is its production of the common as a feeling, necessarily  shared. Its form is inseparable from its affect. A spectacle is  affective form and this is its common good.  7  Critical  media  theorists  have  recently  begun  to  consider  the  affective  dimension  of  networks.  Describing  the  shift  in  thought toward affect, Patricia Clough writes that the “affective  turn”  marks  “an  intensification  of  self-reflexivity   processes  turning back on themselves to act on themselves  in informa- tion communications systems, including the human body; in  archiving machines, including all forms of media technologies  and human memory; in capital flows, including the circulation  of value through human labor and technology; and in biopoliti- cal networks of disciplining, surveillance, and control.”43 Some  of the recent work on affect and media technologies extends  out of Michael Hardt’s and Antonio Negri’s Empire  which is  influenced by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari . In the context  of outlining Empire as a new global political-economic forma- tion, Hardt and Negri discuss the expansion and proliferation  of communication networks as well as the role of informatiza- tion in the post-Fordist economy. Among the changes in labor  they  associate  with  informatization  is  “the  production  and  manipulation of affect.”44 Here they are concerned with feel- ings – of attachment, affection, excitement, fear, ease, or well- being – as products. Hardt and Negri view affective labor as  including  such  seemingly  diverse  sectors  as  entertainment,  health  care,  and  women’s  unpaid  labor.  Each  of  these  areas  involves the production of feelings, be they those of thrill and  amusement,  vitality  and  security,  or  care  and  belonging.  Women’s affective labor is particularly important to Hardt and  Negri’s  account  because  it  produces  social  networks.  They  don’t  link  these  social  networks  directly  to  the  internet,  however,  nor  do  they  take  up  the  disruptive  dimensions  of  networked intensities. Nonetheless, their association of affec- tive labor with the production of social networks opens up the  possibility of conceiving communication networks not simply   C2  DBG_04.indd   113  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   114  Affective	Networks  in terms of linked machines but as networks that are consti- tutively affective.  Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker go further in this  direction  as  they  critique  Hardt  and  Negri  for  relying  on  a  simple symmetry between Empire and the revolutionary force  opposing  it,  the  multitude.  For  Galloway  and  Thacker,  the  network form itself needs to be interrogated, particularly with  regard  to  the  constitutive  tension  “between  unitary  aggrega- tion and anonymous distribution, between the intentionality  and  agency  of  individuals  and  groups  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  uncanny,  unhuman  intentionality  of  the  network  as  an  ‘abstract’ whole.”45 My claim is that this uncanny intentionality  is best understood via the psychoanalytic notion of drive. The  loops and repetitions of the acephalous circuit of drive describe  the movement of the networks of communicative capitalism,  the  ways  its  flows  capture  subjects,  intensities,  and  aspira- tions. Accompanying each repetition, each loop or reversal, is  a little nugget of enjoyment. We contribute to the networks,  as creative producers and vulnerable consumers, because we  enjoy it. In fact, the open architecture of the internet enables  and requires the capture of enjoyment insofar as it is premised  on users’ contributions, alterations, and engagement. It’s not  like  cinema,  where  people  only  have  to  show  up.  For  the   internet to function at all  as is abundantly clear in Web 2.0  and  3G  mobile  networks ,  people  have  to  use  it,  add  to  it,  extend  it,  play  with  it.  Our  participation  does  not  subvert   communicative  capitalism.  It  drives  it.  Again,  contemporary  information  and  communication  networks  are  essentially  affective networks.  Terranova  also  jumps  off  from  Hardt  and  Negri’s  discus- sion of Empire in terms of a network of networks. Particularly  compelling  in  this  regard  is  her  rejection  of  all  too-static  accounts of the internet as a global grid or extended database  that  displace  attention  from  movement  in  and  through  the  networks. Communication networks are dynamic. Terranova  writes, “A piece of information spreading throughout the open  space of the network is not only a vector in search of a target,  it is also a potential transformation of the space crossed that  always leave something behind – a new idea, a new affect  even   C2  DBG_04.indd   114  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  115  an annoyance , a modification of the overall topology.”46 This  something left behind, this product of movement through the  networks,  should  be  thought  in  terms  of  enjoyment:  both  result from circulation through a communicative space.  Terranova  approaches  this  affective  production,  however,  via the image  she positions the image as a sort of bioweapon  in an informational ecology . Although the image is too restric- tive  a  notion  to  account  for  the  variety  of  contributions  to  contemporary  networks  –  music,  sounds,  words,  sentences,  games, videos, fragments of code, viruses, bots, crawlers, and  the  flow  of  interactions  themselves  as  in  blogs,  Twitter,  Facebook,  and  YouTube  –  Terranova  rightly  highlights  that  what’s at stake in the image “is the kind of affect that it packs,  the movements that it receives, inhibits, and or transmits.”47  The most interesting aspect of the image, in other words, is  the way that it is not simply itself but itself plus a nugget or  shadow or trace of intensity. An image is itself and more.  Psychoanalysis can be of some assistance in theorizing the  movements Terranova associates with affect. As Joan Copjec  points out, both Freud and Lacan associate affect with move- ment.48 Freud viewed affect as a kind of displacement, repre- sentation’s  fundamental  “out-of-phaseness”  with  itself.  The  conventional view of the displacement of affect treats it as the  distortion  of  perception  by  an  excess  of  feeling.  Copjec  dis- agrees, arguing that the affective experience of something as  moving indexes a movement beyond the perceiving individual,  a  surfeit  or  excess  that  ruptures  the  perception,  making  it  more than itself and enabling it to open up another register   for Lacan, the Real; for Deleuze, the virtual . Affect, then, is  this movement, a movement which estranges the subject from  its experience. A thought, memory, or perception is affective  to  the  extent  that  it  opens  up  or  indexes  something  beyond  me.  I  can’t  help  but  think  of  the  cute  cat  photos  and  funny  animal videos that circulate on the net. Why do people upload,  forward, and link to these? It’s not only because cats are cute  or even because one’s own cat is completely interesting. It’s  that  the  feeling  that  the  cuteness  accesses,  the  feeling  that  moves  it,  opens  to  something  more,  to  a  kind  of  beyond  or   C2  DBG_04.indd   115  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   116  Affective	Networks  potential. The dimension of affect is this “more than a feeling”  that  imparts  movement.  The  potential  here  may  be  for  con- nection  though one should be careful not to reduce affect to  the intensions of the subject sending cute cat photos , but not  necessarily  –  anyone  who  uses  email  knows  how  annoying  forwarded  cuteness  can  actually  be.  Cute  sayings  or  images  are also not the only contributions that circulate: funny videos,  shocking statements, pressing opportunities, silly applications  all  inhabit  contemporary  communication  networks.  They  all  provide  momentary,  even  fleeting,  charges  and  intensities,  interruptions and divergences.  Insofar  as  affect  as  a  movement  designates  a  doubling  of   an  image,  utterance,  perception,  or  sound  into  itself  and   something else, we can account for the affective discharge or  reflexivized communication. The additive dimension of com- munication for its own sake designates an excess. This excess  isn’t a new meaning or perspective. It doesn’t refer to a new  content. It is rather the intensity accrued from the repetition,  the excitement or thrill of more. In the reflexive doubling of  communication,  the  enjoyment  attached  to  communication  for  its  own  sake  displaces  intention,  content,  and  meaning.  The something extra in repetition is enjoyment, the enjoyment  that is captured in the drive and the enjoyment that commu- nicative capitalism expropriates.  At the same time that affect is movement, there is a specific  affect that is a halting or arrest. Copjec invokes the image of  running in place. This affect that is an inhibition of movement  is  anxiety.  The  experience  of  anxiety  is  a  confrontation  with  excessive enjoyment: one encounters what is in one more than  oneself, an alien yet intimate kernel at the core of one’s being.  Copjec writes, “Jouissance makes me me, while preventing me  from knowing who I am.”49 Finding oneself face-to-face with  jouissance,  one  is  pulled  between  incomprehensibility  and  extreme intimacy.  Copjec identifies two versions of the experience of anxiety:  exposure to the excess of our unrealized past and to the pun- ishing, relentless super-ego, itself an altered form of jouissance   as Žižek frequently puts it, the fundamental injunction of the  super-ego is Enjoy! .50 In the first instance, my anxiety results   C2  DBG_04.indd   116  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  117  from encountering past alternatives: What would I have become  had I stayed in that relationship? What would have happened had  I arrived the next day instead? Copjec writes, “For, in the experi- ence of anxiety, one has a sense not only of being chained to  an enjoyment that outstrips and precedes one, but also of the  opacity  of  this  enjoyment,  its  incomprehensibility  and  unas- sumability,  which  is  dependent,  I  have  argued,  on  its  being  grounded in nothing actual, in a ‘thrust-aside’ past that never  took place.”51 Facing my enjoyment, uniquely mine but alien  and seemingly unchosen, I cannot avoid the unsettling ques- tion “how did I get here?”52  We should also add to this aspect of anxiety the enjoyment  of the other. As Žižek explains, one of the ways that the subject  organizes  enjoyment  is  via  fantasies  about  the  other.  These  fantasies express essential features of our own enjoyment. For  example,  homophobic  treatments  of  gay  men  as  excessively  promiscuous, as having frequent, intense, anonymous sexual  encounters, express the homophobe’s suppositions regarding  real  sexual  satisfaction   consequently,  for  conservatives,  gay  marriage threatens marriage itself by eliminating its supple- mental fantasy: that one sacrificed real sexual satisfaction for  its sake; this sacrifice is necessary for the sacred character of  marriage  –  without  it,  sex  becomes  common,  conventional,  and  rather  boring;  in  other  words,  the  worst  that  the  homo- phobe can imagine is that gay sex is just as boring as married  sex . Žižek writes: “the fascinating image of the Other gives a  body to our own innermost split, to what is ‘in us more than  ourselves’; and thus prevents us from achieving full identity  with ourselves. The hatred of the Other is the hatred of our own  excess of enjoyment.”53  In  the  second  instance,  the  experience  of  anxiety  results  from  the  super-ego  injunction  to  enjoy.  The  super-ego  com- mands the subject to an impossible enjoyment, to find com- plete fulfillment in sex, exercise, professional achievement, a  fabulous  vacation.  The  very  impossibility  of  fulfilling  this  injunction not only suffocates the poor subject but also incites  a  flight  away  from  anxiety  and  toward  the  pursuit  of  knowl- edge.54 To avoid the anxiety of the jouissance that prevents me  from knowing who I am, I come under a compulsion to “Keep   C2  DBG_04.indd   117  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   118  Affective	Networks  on  knowing  more  and  more,”  a  compulsion  or  thrust  that  Lacan associates with an “epistemological drive.”55 The attempt  to escape anxiety thus results in capture at another level. Lacan  associates  this  capture  with  science,  capitalism,  and  the  dis- course of the university. We can extend this point by noting  their contemporary merger and materialization in networked  information and communications media  after all, the internet  arose  in  the  context  of  government-sponsored  research,  ini- tially  carried  out  not  only  at  the  Department  of  Defense  but  also at a small number of universities, the linking together of  which provided the groundwork for the internet that was later  opened  up  to  commercial  interests  and  celebrated  as  the  primary figure of global capitalism .  To reiterate, the object of anxiety is surplus jouissance, des- ignated by Lacan as objet petit a. Copjec presents it in terms of  a  confrontation  with  an  unrealized  past  as  well  as  with  the  super-ego, a confrontation the subject attempts to flee by pur- suing knowledge. Her account of anxiety corresponds to what  Žižek  following Jacques-Alain Miller  designates as “constitu- tive anxiety”: that is, “confrontation with objet petit a as consti- tuted in its very loss,” that is, objet petit a as an object of drive.56  In both instances, the object is loss  rather than lost : the loss  of an unknowable past  rather than a specific experience , the  loss of a capacity to obey or comply  no matter what one does,  one cannot satisfy the super-ego . The blockage or stuckness  of  anxiety,  then,  is  at  the  same  time  the  repetitive,  circular  movement of drive, the force of loss.  The point becomes clearer when we consider epistemologi- cal drive: keep on knowing more and more. In Lacan’s account  in Seminar XVII, this “keeping on” results from the change  in the status of the Master in university discourse: that is to  say, a change in the status and function of knowledge. Because  university  discourse  cannot  be  anchored,  cannot  be  held  in  place by an ultimate truth or injunction, it keeps on keeping  on knowing. It doesn’t come to an end or reach an ultimate  goal. It circulates, and its circulation is an effect of its failure  to anchor. Nothing can stop the progress of science; nothing  can stop the movement of ideas. Information wants to be free  –  to  circulate  round  and  round.  The  more  knowledge  we   C2  DBG_04.indd   118  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  119  accrue, the less we know. Abundance from one perspective is  lack from another.  The  networks  of  communicative  capitalism  are  affective  because they are characterized by drive. Their affective dimen- sion thus should not be reduced to desiring productivity or a  nurturing  emotional  practice.  Contra  Hardt  and  Negri,  net- worked communication is better understood via the negativity  of drive, a negativity that results in stuckness and movement,  rupture and creativity, a negativity, in other words, capable of  accounting  for  the  reflexivity  in  real  networks   so,  negativity  here connotes positive feedback and the excess of an effect in  relation to its cause . More crudely put, the affective charges  we transmit and confront reinforce and extend affective net- works without encouraging – and, indeed, by displacing – their  consolidation  into  organized  political  networks.57  While  this  circulation might constitute a kind of affective labor, it is affec- tive labor that is already captured.  In  fact,  rather  than  presuming  the  fit  of  the  category  of  labor, we do better to note the persistent disagreement among  bloggers and net researchers regarding work and play in social  networks. When we blog, are we working or playing? If we are  working, then for whom are we working? Who enjoys or who  accrues enjoyment? If we enjoy, does that mean we are actually  playing?58 Or might the instability here index the fact that we  are caught in circuits of drive wherein we cannot escape enjoy- ment but neither can we assume or accept it as our own?  Lost horizon loss as horizon  The now old cyberpunk fiction of a cyberspace, techno-utopian  fantasy of an information frontier, and still lingering supposi- tion  of  “the  Internet”  as  a  domain  separate  from  “real  life”  continue to dwindle as imaginaries of an outside. Global com- munications  networks  connect  through  a  variety  of  devices,  technologies, and media – internet, mobile phones, radio, tele- vision, global positioning systems, game platforms, etc. One  of the more interesting features of massive multiplayer online  role-playing games is the intersecting of game and non-game   C2  DBG_04.indd   119  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   120  Affective	Networks  worlds:  players  can  buy  and  trade  currencies  and  characters  outside  the  gamespace.  What  initially  appears  as  the  most  separate and complete realm for living fantasies quickly opens  up  into  the  actualities  of  financial  markets,  wage  labor,  and  exploitation. The expansions and intensifications of networked  interactions thus point not to a closed field but to the non-all  Real of human interaction.  the  same   in  all  possible   In his later work, Žižek supplements the “Lacanian account  of the Real as that which ‘always returns to its place’ – as that  which  remains   symbolic   universes.”59He  adds  the  notion  of  a  parallax  Real:  that  is,  a  Real capable of accounting for the multiplicity of appearances  of the same underlying Real. Such a parallax Real is a gap or  shift between perspectives. It does not embody a substantial  point of information or sensory perception  you feel it in your  gut; I feel it in my bones . Rather, it is the shift from one per- spective to another. The Real, then, does not refer to what is  the same but to the “hard bone of contention which pulverizes  the sameness into the multitude of appearances.” It is retro- actively posited as the necessary yet impossible cause of this  very  multiplicity.  In  other  words,  the  parallax  Real  denotes  multiplicity and its impossible core, a “purely virtual, actually  nonexistent X.”60  Such a notion of a parallax Real is well-suited to communi- cative capitalism. What appears is multiplicity, pulverization,  the constant and repeated assertion of something else, some- thing  different.  To  the  extent  that  the  shifts  of  perspective  appear  immediately   without  interpretation,  meaning,  eleva- tion to the status of a universal , they obscure the fact of con- tention, as if the shifts were among a multitude of singularities  each with its own perspective, none of which is more powerful,  more structural, or more true than another  an example from  the US is the way that conservatives accuse liberals of racism  when  liberals  argue  for  racial  diversity  in  political  appoint- ments . What is obscured is the underlying gap or disavowal,  the virtual X of fundamental antagonism. The multiplicity of  shifts effaces their embeddedness in capitalism – more specifi- cally, the communicative capitalism that makes their expres- sion  possible.  If  the  Real  is  ultimately  impossible,  then  it   C2  DBG_04.indd   120  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  121  names the obstacle we come up against in our supposition and  experience of reality. In communicative capitalism, that obsta- cle is the  missing  efficiency of the symbolic.  The Real of the internet is the circulatory movement of drive  – the repeated making, uploading, sampling, and decomposi- tion  occurring  as  movement  on  the  internet  doubles  itself,  becoming itself and its record or trace – effected by symbolic  efficiency  as  loss.  The  movement  from  link  to  link,  the  for- warding  and  storing  and  commenting,  the  contributing  without expectation of response but in hope of further move- ment  why else count page views?  is circulation for its own  sake. Drive’s circulation forms a loop. The empty space within  it, then, is not the result of the loss of something that was there  before  and  now  is  missing.  The  drive  of  the  internet  is  not  around  the  missing  Master  signifier   which  is  foreclosed  rather than missing . Instead, it is the inside of the loop, the  space of nothing that the loop makes appear. This endless loop  that  persists  for  its  own  sake  is  the  difference  that  makes  a  difference  between  so-called  “old”  and  “new”  media.  Old  media sought to deliver messages. New media just circulate. Understanding this circulation via drive enables us to grasp  how we are captured in its loop, how the loop ensnares. First,  we enjoy failure. Insofar as the aim of the drive is not to reach  its  goal  but  to  enjoy,  we  enjoy  our  endless  circulation,  our  repetitive  loop.  We  cannot  know  certainly;  we  cannot  know  adequately.61 But we can mobilize this loss, googling, checking  Wikipedia, mistrusting it immediately, losing track of what we  doing,  going  somewhere  else.  We  are  captured  because  we  enjoy. This idea appears in writing that associates new media  with drugs, “users” and “using,” as well as colloquial expres- sions like “Facecrack.”  As a friend said to me, well, why didn’t  you  tell  me  Mafia  Wars  is  like  crack?  Now  I’ll  totally  play!   Thomas Elsaesser illustrates the point via YouTube. Describing  his movement among the links and videos, he writes,  after an hour or so, one realizes on what fine a line one has to  balance to keep one’s sanity, between the joy of discovering the  unexpected, the marvelous and occasionally even the miraculous,  and the rapid descent into an equally palpable anxiety, staring into   C2  DBG_04.indd   121  4 9 2010   1:36:12 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   122  Affective	Networks  the void of a sheer bottomless amount of videos, with their pro- liferation  of  images,  their  banality  or  obscenity  in  sounds  and  commentary.62  Failure,  or  what  Elsaesser  tags  “constructive  instability,”  is  functional  for  communicative  capitalism;  it’s  our  ensnare- ment in the loop of drive.  Second, we are captured in our passivity or, more precisely,  by the reversion of our active engagements and interventions  into  passive  forms  of  “being  made  aware”  or  “having  been  stated.” The problem, then, is that ubiquitous, personal media,  communication for its own sake, turn our activity into passiv- ity.  They  capture  it,  use  it.  We  end  up  oscillating  between  extremes. On the one hand, we have opinions, theories, ideas,  and information that we want to share. So we write our books  and blogs, adding in our contribution to the circulating flow.  Just  what  was  needed  –  another  blog.  On  the  other  hand,  the  information age is an age wherein we lack the information we  need to act. As communicative capitalism incites a continuous  search for information, it renders information perpetually out  of  reach.  Outraged,  engaged,  desperate  to  do  something,  we  look  for  evidence,  ask  questions,  and  make  demands,  again  contributing to the circuits of drive. A concrete example here  is the George W. Bush administration’s torture policy. Before  and after Bush left office, a refrain circulated concerning the  need  to  get  to  the  truth  of  the  situation,  to  see  more  photo- graphs, to read more documents – as if it had not been known  since at least 2004 that the US was torturing prisoners cap- tured in the so-called “war on terror.” Since photographs and  documents  already  were  circulating,  since  members  of  the  Bush administration – including Vice President Cheney – had  already acknowledged that they did in fact approve the policy  of  torture,  the  problem  was  not  the  absence  of  information.  What was missing is instead more radical: namely, a capacity  to  see  ourselves  as  acting  rather  than  querying,  searching,  waiting for action to happen.  Christian  Marazzi  makes  a  related  observation  in  his  description of imitative behavior among those working in the  finance sector. He writes, “One important result of the empiri-  C2  DBG_04.indd   122  4 9 2010   1:36:13 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  123  cal studies of the behavioral finance theorists is this very notion  of imitative behavior based on the structural information deficits  of  all  investors,  be  they  large  or  small.  .  .  .  The  modalities  of  communication of what the ‘others’ consider a good stock to  invest  in  counts  more  than  what  is  communicated.”63  Psychoanalysis associates an imitative, competitive relation to  others  with  imaginary  identification.  Imitative  behavior  can  thus be read as an index of the decline of symbolic efficiency.  Unable to find a standpoint from which to assess the adequacy  of  the  available  information,  bond  traders  and  hedge  fund  managers  mimic  those  around  them,  creating  cascades  and  bubbles.  The gaze  discussed in chapter 2  draws us to a third way  we  are  captured  in  contemporary  communication  networks.  Because the gaps are not filled  because perception as such is  distorted , because they cannot be filled, we are drawn to them,  inscribing  ourselves  in  the  images  we  see,  the  texts  that  we  read. So although online interactions like blogging might ini- tially  appear  as  so  many  ways  that  we  search  for  ourselves,  trying  to  know  who  we  are,  to  pull  together  our  fragmented  identities, the other aspect of the gaze, its traumatic disruption  of the image, is perhaps even more crucial. Lacking answers,  ever  more  uncertain,  we  become  mesmerized  by  our  own  looking, entranced by the reversal of looking for an object to  looking at ourselves as objects, to becoming objects ourselves.  I can approach the same idea from a different direction: the  satisfaction  provided  by  identifying  with  a  group  also  arises  from  transgressing  the  group’s  expectations.  Scary  zombie  pop-ups  spliced  into  conventional  YouTube  videos  illustrate  this point. Just as the viewer has become absorbed in the video,  perhaps searching for the ghost or the key to the magic trick,  a monstrous image accompanied by a hideous scream shocks  her out of her absorption, reminding her that, in a way, the  fault is hers – she shouldn’t have been wasting her time watch- ing videos online, shouldn’t have let her guard down, shouldn’t  have presumed that the video images had a flow independent  of her investment in them.  Contemporary  communication  networks  are  reflexive:   we,  the  users,  are  creating  them.  We  are  producing  the    C2  DBG_04.indd   123  4 9 2010   1:36:13 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   124  Affective	Networks  environment  we  inhabit,  the  connections  that  configure  us.  We provide the feedback that amplifies or ignores  or write the  code that provides the feedback that amplifies or ignores . We  are  configuring  the  worlds  we  inhabit,  yet  they  are  ever  less  what  we  desire  but  haven’t  reached  and  ever  more  what  we  cannot  escape  yet  still  enjoy.  I  have  argued  throughout  this  book that the psychoanalytic concept of drive helps explain our  current media trap. As it designates the plasticity of the objects  to which we become attached, the repetitive movements of our  attachment through networks, and the extremes and disequi- libria  inextricable  from  the  circuits  that  result,  drive  indexes  the  primary  structure  of  enjoyment  for  contemporary  what- ever beings.  Affective  networks  capture  users  in  circuits  of  drive.  The  more we contribute, the more extensive our submission. More  bluntly put, as we share our opinions and upload our videos,  there are more opinions to read and videos to watch and then  more responses to craft and elements to mash up. And then  there are still more responses to read, and as these increase  so do the challenges of finding the ones we want. At that point,  we  can  see  what  the  crowd  thinks,  what  has  passed  muster,  risen to the top, been shared, forwarded, and recommended.  The  result  looks  like  a  power  law  distribution   like  any  hit  movie, song, or best-selling novel  – new voices are disadvan- taged,  those  without  language,  media,  and  visual  skills  will  remain lost in the flow.  With  each  click  and  intervention,  moreover,  we  make  a  mark that can be traced, capitalized, and sold. This does not  mean that systems of surveillance and expropriation are seam- less and efficient. On the contrary, intensifications can disrupt,  overload, and crash particular sites and servers. They can reg- ister as new trending topics on Twitter and in the blogipelago,  perhaps even getting a minute or two of airtime on cable news  and maybe occasioning a piece in one of the few remaining  print magazines or newspapers  as if these were properly polit- ical ends  . The displacement of political conflict to the terrain  of networked media has the perverse repercussion of perpetu- ally expanding the topography of struggle even as it constantly  signals  the  locations,  intentions,  and  networks  of  those  who   C2  DBG_04.indd   124  4 9 2010   1:36:13 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Affective	Networks  125  are fighting. This expansion has thus far strengthened com- municative  capitalism  as  it  feeds  on  accelerating  crises  and  emergencies. It also increases the exposure and vulnerability  of those engaged in active protest and resistance on the ground.  No wonder the diversion of cute cat photos is so welcome.  Some  readers  will  no  doubt  disagree  with  me.  They  will  want to emphasize all sorts of tools and apps that enable activ- ists  to  coordinate  and  get  their  messages  “out  there,”  as  if  media  politics  today  were  a  politics  of  messages  rather  than  one set in the decline of symbolic efficiency. Most likely, they  will  point  enthusiastically  to  sites  like  MoveOn   a  US-based  site that coordinates fund-raising, petition, letter, and fax-cam- paigns for liberal and left causes  and underplay the far right  and white supremacist message boards.64 They may extend the  heroic, outsider ethic of the hacker into the practices of blog- gers,  as  if  the  setting  and  subjectivities  had  remained  the  same, as if the last decades of networked media had not con- figured the users.  Other readers will assume I’m a luddite or technophobe and  thereby  avoid  taking  up  the  harder  task  of  thinking  through  the disadvantages, costs, and challenges the turbulent media  environment  poses  for  an  anti-capitalist  politics  oriented  toward economic and social equality. It’s easier to set up a new  blog  than  it  is  to  undertake  the  ground-level  organizational  work of building alternatives. It’s also difficult to think through  the ways our practices and activities are producing new sub- jectivities, subjectivities that may well be more accustomed to  quick  satisfaction  and  bits  of  enjoyment  than  to  planning,  discipline,  sacrifice,  and  delay,  subjectivities  that  may  well  eschew equality as an end.  Most  readers  will  likely  find  my  analysis  here  too  bleak,  despite the fact that I said from the outset that critical media  theory should forswear affective offerings of hope and reassur- ance.  These  readers  will  emphasize  contingency  and  the   unexpected. After all, we can’t predict the future; it’s an open  field of potentialities  I think tendencies are stronger in some  directions  than  they  are  in  others .  The  question,  then,  is  whether  a  media  politics  that  does  not  merely  circulate  con- tributions  is  possible  or  if  a  politics  capable  of  overturning   C2  DBG_04.indd   125  4 9 2010   1:36:13 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   126  Affective	Networks  communicative capitalism must emerge via a cut through the  circuits of drive. The former course of media politics ranges  from the cultivation of critical media competencies and local,  face-to-face, street-level activism to the organization of covert  cells of communist hackers. Each of these attends to practices  of subjectification that might work against the limbo of what- ever  being.  The  latter  course  of  the  cut  through  drive  also  needs the skills of the communist hackers and the local ties  of  street  activists,  although  it  could  result  from  completely  unpredictable crises or from the amplification of the effects of  predictable disturbances cascading through complex networks.  So even if the revolutionary overthrow of communicative capi- talism seems like the remnant of twentieth-century fantasies   although it shouldn’t , the reality of extremes, turbulence, and  destruction in the reflexive circuits of complex networks cannot  be avoided. It can at best be channeled, reinforced, and retro- actively  determined  in  directions  less  likely  to  exploit  and  immiserate.  Both  courses,  alternative  media  politics  and  the  cut  through  drive,  need  critical  media  theory.  But  neither  should presume it’s sufficient: as long as politics is reduced to  communication, it will remain captured.

Wendy  Hui  Kyong  Chun,  Control  and  Freedom:  Power  and  Paranoia  in  the  Age  of  Fiber  Optics   Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006 , also draws from Žižek’s  notion  of  the  decline  of  symbolic  efficiency   269–71 .  Chun  wrongly suggests that Žižek believes that “reasserting symbolic  paternal  authority  will  reinforce  symbolic  authority,”  thereby  missing entirely the point of his discussion of the death s  of  the father s  in The Ticklish Subject  London: Verso, 1999 . Slavoj  Žižek,  The  Plague  of  Fantasies   London:  Verso,  1997   150–3.  11   12  Dany-Robert  Dufour  has  a  similar  discussion  in  The  Art  of  Shrinking Heads, translated by David Macey  Cambridge, UK:  Polity, 2008 .  13  Plague 150. 14  Plague 163. 15  Žižek writes, “In short, the properly dialectical paradox resides  in the fact that the very ‘empirical’, explicit realization of a prin- ciple  undermines  its  reign”;  The  Indivisible  Remainder   London:  Verso, 1996  195.  Indivisible Remainder 196. Indivisible Remainder 196.  16  Plague 155. 17  18  19  Plague 156. 20  My  reading  of  Žižek’s  account  of  the  loss  of  the  Real  of  the  Other, over-proximity, and paranoia corrects some of the errors  in  Chun’s  treatment  of  paranoia  in  Control  and  Freedom.  Missing  the  way  that  the  function  of  the  signifier  is  always  virtual,  Chun  asks  whether  “being  a  father”  can  “stand  as  a  primordial  signifier  now  that  fatherhood  can  be  scientifically  determined”  271 .  The problem here is twofold. First, the symbolic function of  the paternal signifier had nothing to do with the “being” of a   C2  DBG_EN.indd   128  4 9 2010   1:36:13 PM  Dean—Blog Theory   Notes to pp. 8–9  129  father.  There  was  always  a  necessary  gap  between  being  and  signification   “standing” .  Lacan  explains  in  Seminar  XVII:  “The real father is nothing other than an effect of language and  has no other real  .  .  .  the notion of the real father is scientifically  unsustainable”;  Jacques  Lacan,  The  Seminar  of  Jacques  Lacan,  Book XVII: The Other Side of Psychoanalysis, edited by Jacques- Alain  Miller,  translated  by  Russell  Grigg   New  York:  W.W.  Norton,  2007   127.  Second,  that  the  function  of  the  paternal  signifier is in decline, that it has changed fundamentally as a  result  of  universalized  reflexivity,  is  precisely  Žižek’s  point   Ticklish Subject 342–7 .  Additionally,  insofar  as  she  fails  to  understand  that  the  changes  in  communicative  capitalism  fundamentally  impact  the very possibility of meaning, Chun mistakenly presents para- noia in terms of “inadequate information” and “technologies’  vulnerabilities”  267–8 . In connection with her assertion that  the  problem  of  paranoia  involves  ignoring  “the  difference  between  possibility  and  probability,”  these  remarks  obfuscate  what’s  at  stake  in  the  decline  of  symbolic  efficiency,  namely,  the conditions of possibility of adequation and credibility  259 .  No  amount  of  information,  technology,  or  surveillance  will  compensate for the change in the symbolic.  In the terms of the early Lacan to whose analyses of psycho- sis Chun refers, the foreclosure of the paternal signifier means  that there is nothing that can hold together the chain of signi- fications  although there are possibilities for momentary stabi- lizations of meaning significance effected through objet petit a .  The change in the symbolic is Real. As Žižek writes, “The sus- pension of the function of the  symbolic  Master is the crucial  feature of the Real whose contours loom on the horizon of the  cyberspace  universe”   Plague  154 .  For  the  subject,  the  conse- quence of this absence of symbolic mediation of the imaginary  and the Real is suffocating closure before the intrusions of the  unbearable jouissance of the other. Chun’s appeal to a view of  freedom as vulnerability thus remains trapped in the terms that  she endeavors to critique: the vulnerable subject threatened by  the  jouissance  of  the  other  is  strictly  correlative  to  the  decline  of the symbolic and the absence  and resulting overproximity   of the other qua Real.

Crucial to their distinction is their  critical  perspective  on  immediacy  as  falsely  naturalizing:  that  is, as pretending an illusory access to an unmediated reality. I  am less interested in terminology here than I am in the instabil- ity  of  the  distinction  in  the  context  of  user-generated  content  and  the  massification  of  interpersonal  media  devices:  media   our  absorption  in  a  media  environment,  our  impulses  to  mediate our experiences  are immediate. “2009 State of the Blogosphere”  see note 6 above .  11  12  Posted by Tim at the blog “Road to Surfdom,” May 9, 2006.

She  focuses  on  three  oppositional  sets  –  textuality  and  orality,  corporeality  and  spatiality,  and  public  and  private  –  which blogging blurs. The oppositional pairs are unconvincing,  particularly after the emergence of the printing press. It’s dif- ficult to see, then, why framing a discussion of new media in  old modernist terms is helpful. Additionally, given her useful  complicating of an approach to blogs in terms of singular meta- phors and definitions, boyd too quickly resorts to the totalizing  image  of  a  blogosphere  and  of  the  blogosphere  as  the  public  sphere. There is not a sphere  or world or community  of blogs   just like there is not a sphere or community of paper . There  is also not “a” or “the” public.

That is the individual who has  changed  as  a  result  of  a  large  amount  of  free  time,  cultural  consumption  and  a  sort  of  “power  to  enjoy”.  Most  of  us  will  recognise that the Postfordist labouring process actually takes  advantage in its way of this very transformation albeit depriving  it of all emancipatory qualities. What is learned, carried out and  consumed in the time outside of labour is then utilised in the  production of commodities, becomes a part of the use value of  labour power and is computed as profitable resource. Even the  greater “power to enjoy” is always on the verge of being turned  into labouring task.  “General Intellect,” translated by Arianna  Bove.

@highlight

Blog Theory offers a critical theory of contemporary media. Furthering her account of communicative capitalism, Jodi Dean explores the ways new media practices like blogging and texting capture their users in intensive networks of enjoyment, production, and surveillance. Her wide-ranging and theoretically rich analysis extends from her personal experiences as a blogger, through media histories, to newly emerging social network platforms and applications. Set against the background of the economic crisis wrought by neoliberalism, the book engages with recent work in contemporary media theory as well as with thinkers such as Giorgio Agamben, Jean Baudrillard, Guy Debord, Jacques Lacan, and Slavoj ?i?ek. Through these engagements, Dean defends the provocative thesis that reflexivity in complex networks is best understood via the psychoanalytic notion of the drives. She contends, moreover, that reading networks in terms of the drives enables us to grasp their real, human dimension, that is, the feelings and affects that embed us in the system. In remarkably clear and lucid prose, Dean links seemingly trivial and transitory updates from the new mass culture of the internet to more fundamental changes in subjectivity and politics. Everyday communicative exchangesÑfrom blog posts to text messagesÑhave widespread effects, effects that not only undermine capacities for democracy but also entrap us in circuits of domination.
