The book is a code- driven introduction to JAX-WS  Java API for XML-Web Services , the framework of choice for Java web services, whether SOAP-based or REST-style. My approach is to interpret JAX-WS broadly and, therefore, to include leading-edge developments such as the Jersey project for REST-style web services, officially known as JAX-RS  Java API for XML-RESTful Web Services . JAX-WS is bundled into the Metro Web Services Stack, or Metro for short. Metro is part of core Java, starting with Standard Edition 6  hereafter, core Java 6 . However, the Metro releases outpace the core Java releases. The current Metro release can be down- loaded separately from https:  wsit.dev.java.net. Metro is also integrated into the Sun application server, GlassFish. Given these options, this book’s examples are deployed in four different ways:  Core Java only  This is the low-fuss approach that makes it easy to get web services and their clients up and running. The only required software is the Java software development kit  SDK , core Java 6 or later. Web services can be deployed easily using the Endpoint, HttpServer, and HttpsServer classes. The early examples take this approach.  Core Java with the current Metro release  This approach takes advantage of Metro features not yet available in the core Java bundle. In general, each Metro release makes it easier to write web services and clients. The current Metro release also indicates where JAX-WS is moving. The Metro release also can be used with core Java 5 if core Java 6 is not an option.  Standalone Tomcat  This approach builds on the familiarity among Java programmers with standalone web containers such as Apache Tomcat, which is the reference implementation. Web services can be deployed using a web container in essentially the same way as are servlets, JavaServer Pages  JSP  scripts, and JavaServer Faces  JSF  scripts. A standalone  web  container  such  as  Tomcat  is  also  a  good  way  to  introduce container-managed security for web services.  ix  Download at Boykma.Com   GlassFish  This  approach  allows  deployed  web  services  to  interact  naturally  with  other enterprise components such as Java Message Service topics and queues, a JNDI  Java Naming and Directory Interface  provider, a backend database system and the @Entity instances that mediate between an application and the database sys- tem, and an EJB  Enterprise Java Bean  container. The EJB container is important because a web service can be deployed as a stateless Session EJB, which brings advantages such as container-managed thread safety. GlassFish works seamlessly with Metro, including its advanced features, and with popular IDEs  Integrated Development Environment  such as NetBeans and Eclipse.  An appealing feature of JAX-WS is that the API can be separated cleanly from deploy- ment options. One and the same web service can be deployed in different ways to suit different needs. Core Java alone is good for learning, development, and even lightweight deployment. A standalone web container such as Tomcat provides additional support. A Java application server such as GlassFish promotes easy integration of web services with other enterprise technologies.  Code-Driven Approach My code examples are short enough to highlight key features of JAX-WS but also re- alistic enough to show off the production-level capabilities that come with the JAX-WS framework. Each code example is given in full, including all of the import statements. My approach is to begin with a relatively sparse example and then to add and modify features. The code samples vary in length from a few statements to several pages of source. The code is deliberately modular. Whenever there is a choice between con- ciseness and clarity in coding, I try to opt for clarity. The examples come with instructions for compiling and deploying the web services and for testing the service against sample clients. This approach presents the choices that JAX-WS makes available to the programmer but also encourages a clear and thor- ough analysis of the JAX-WS libraries and utilities. My goal is to furnish code samples that can serve as templates for commercial applications. JAX-WS is a rich API that is explored best in a mix of overview and examples. My aim is to explain key features about the architecture of web services but, above all, to illus- trate each major feature with code examples that perform as advertised. Architecture without code is empty; code without architecture is blind. My approach is to integrate the two throughout the book. Web services are a modern, lightweight approach to distributed software systems, that is, systems such as email or the World Wide Web that require different software com- ponents to execute on physically distinct devices. The devices can range from large servers through personal desktop machines to handhelds of various types. Distributed systems are complicated because they are made up of networked components. There  x  Preface  Download at Boykma.Com   is nothing more frustrating than a distributed systems example that does not work as claimed because the debugging is tedious. My approach is thus to provide full, working examples together with short but precise instructions for getting the sample application up and running. All of the source code for examples is available from the book’s com- panion  site,  at  http:  www.oreilly.com catalog 9780596521127.  My  email  address  is kalin@cdm.depaul.edu. Please let me know if you find any code errors.  Chapter-by-Chapter Overview The book has seven chapters, the last of which is quite short. Here is a preview of each chapter:  Chapter 1, Java Web Services Quickstart  This chapter begins with a working definition of web services, including the dis- tinction between SOAP-based and REST-style services. This chapter then focuses on the basics of writing, deploying, and consuming SOAP-based services in core Java. There are web service clients written in Perl, Ruby, and Java to underscore the language neutrality of web services. This chapter also introduces Java’s SOAP API and covers various ways to inspect web service traffic at the wire level. The chapter elaborates on the relationship between core Java and Metro.  Chapter 2, All About WSDLs  This chapter focuses on the service contract, which is a WSDL  Web Service Def- inition  Language   document  in  SOAP-based  services.  This  chapter  covers  the standard issues of web service style  document versus rpc  and encoding  literal versus encoded . This chapter also focuses on the popular but unofficial distinction between the wrapped and unwrapped variations of document style. All of these issues  are  clarified  through  examples,  including  Java  clients  against  Amazon’s E-Commerce services. This chapter explains how the wsimport utility can ease the task of writing Java clients against commercial web services and how the wsgen utility figures in the distinction between document-style and rpc-style web services. The basics of JAX-B  Java API for XML-Binding  are also covered. This chapter, like the others, is rich in code examples.  Chapter 3, SOAP Handling  This chapter introduces SOAP and logical handlers, which give the service-side and client-side programmer direct access to either the entire SOAP message or just its payload. The structure of a SOAP message and the distinction between SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 are covered. The messaging architecture of a SOAP-based service is  discussed.  Various  code  examples  illustrate  how  SOAP  messages  can  be processed in support of application logic. This chapter also explains how transport- level  messages   for  instance,  the  typical  HTTP  messages  that  carry  SOAP payloads  in  SOAP-based  web  services   can  be  accessed  and  manipulated  in JAX-WS.  This  chapter  concludes  with  a  section  on  JAX-WS  support  for  Preface  xi  Download at Boykma.Com   transporting binary data, with emphasis on MTOM  Message Transmission Op- timization Mechanism .  Chapter 4, RESTful Web Services  This chapter opens with a technical analysis of what constitutes a REST-style serv- ice and moves quickly to code examples. The chapter surveys various approaches to delivering a Java-based RESTful service: WebServiceProvider, HttpServlet, Jer- sey Plain Old Java Object  POJO , and restlet among them. The use of a WADL  Web Application Definition Language  document as a service contract is explored through  code  examples.  The  JAX-P   Java  API  for  XML-Processing   packages, which facilitate XML processing, are also covered. This chapter offers several ex- amples of Java clients against real-world REST-style services, including services hosted by Yahoo!, Amazon, and Tumblr.  Chapter 5, Web Services Security  This chapter begins with an overview of security requirements for real-world web services, SOAP-based and REST-style. The overview covers central topics such as mutual  challenge  and  message  confidentiality,  users-roles  security,  and WS-Security.  Code  examples  clarify  transport-level  security,  particularly  under HTTPS. Container-managed security is introduced with examples deployed in the standalone Tomcat web container. The security material introduced in this chapter is expanded in the next chapter.  Chapter 6, JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  This chapter starts with a survey of what comes with a Java Application Server  JAS :  an  EJB  container,  a  messaging  system,  a  naming  service,  an  integrated database  system,  and  so  on.  This  chapter  has  a  variety  of  code  examples:  a SOAP-based  service  implemented  as  a  stateless  Session  EJB,  WebService  and WebServiceProvider instances deployed through embedded Tomcat, a web service deployed together with a traditional website application, a web service integrated with JMS  Java Message Service , a web service that uses an @Entity to read and write from the Java DB database system included in GlassFish, and a WS-Security application under GlassFish.  Chapter 7, Beyond the Flame Wars  This is a very short chapter that looks at the controversy surrounding SOAP-based and  REST-style  web  services.  My  aim  is  to  endorse  both  approaches,  either  of which is superior to what came before. This chapter traces modern web services from DCE RPC in the early 1990s through CORBA and DCOM up to the Java EE and .NET frameworks. This chapter explains why either approach to web services is better than the distributed-object architecture that once dominated in distributed software systems.  xii   Preface  Download at Boykma.Com   Freedom of Choice: The Tools IDE Issue Java programmers have a wide choice of productivity tools such as Ant and Maven for scripting and IDEs such as Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ IDEA. Scripting tools and IDEs increase productivity by hiding grimy details. In a production environment, such tools and IDEs are the sensible way to go. In a learning environment, however, the goal is to understand the grimy details so that this understanding can be brought to good use during the inevitable bouts of debugging and application maintenance. Accord- ingly, my book is neutral with respect to scripting tools and IDEs. Please feel free to use whichever tools and IDE suit your needs. My how-to segments go over code com- pilation, deployment, and execution at the command line so that details such as class- path  inclusions  and  compilation execution  flags  are  clear.  Nothing  in  any  example depends on a particular scripting tool or IDE.

Preface  xv  Download at Boykma.Com   Download at Boykma.Com   CHAPTER 1 Java Web Services Quickstart  What Are Web Services? Although the term web service has various, imprecise, and evolving meanings, a glance at some features typical of web services will be enough to get us into coding a web service and a client, also known as a consumer or requester. As the name suggests, a web service is a kind of webified application, that is, an application typically delivered over HTTP  Hyper Text Transport Protocol . A web service is thus a distributed ap- plication whose components can be deployed and executed on distinct devices. For instance, a stock-picking web service might consist of several code components, each hosted on a separate business-grade server, and the web service might be consumed on PCs, handhelds, and other devices. Web services can be divided roughly into two groups, SOAP-based and REST-style. The distinction is not sharp because, as a code example later illustrates, a SOAP-based service delivered over HTTP is a special case of a REST-style service. SOAP originally  stood for Simple Object Access Protocol but, by serendipity, now may stand for Service Oriented Architecture  SOA  Protocol. Deconstructing SOA is nontrivial but one point is indisputable: whatever SOA may be, web services play a central role in the SOA approach to software design and development.  This is written with tongue only partly in cheek. SOAP is officially no longer an acronym, and SOAP and SOA can live apart from one another.  For now, SOAP is just an XML  EXtensible Markup Language  dialect in which documents are messages. In SOAP-based web services, the SOAP is mostly unseen infrastructure. For example, in a typical scenario, called the request  response message exchange pattern  MEP , the client’s underlying SOAP library sends a SOAP message as a service request, and the web service’s underlying SOAP library sends another SOAP message as the corresponding service response. The client and the web service source code may provide few hints, if any, about the underlying SOAP  see Figure 1-1 .  1  Download at Boykma.Com   Figure 1-1. Architecture of a typical SOAP-based web service  REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Roy Fielding, one of the main authors of the HTTP specification, coined the acronym in his Ph.D. dissertation to describe an architectural style in the design of web services. SOAP has standards  under the World Wide Web Consortium [W3C] , toolkits, and bountiful software libraries. REST has no standards, few toolkits, and meager software libraries. The REST style is often seen as an antidote to the creeping complexity of SOAP-based web services. This book covers SOAP-based and REST-style web services, starting with the SOAP-based ones. Except in test mode, the client of either a SOAP-based or REST-style service is rarely a web browser but rather an application without a graphical user interface. The client may be written in any language with the appropriate support libraries. Indeed, a major appeal of web services is language transparency: the service and its clients need not be  written  in  the  same  language.  Language  transparency  is  the  key  to  web  service interoperability; that is, the ability of web services and requesters to interact seamlessly despite differences in programming languages, support libraries, and platforms. To underscore this appeal, clients against our Java web services will be written in various languages such as C, Perl, and Ruby, and Java clients will consume services written in other languages, including languages unknown. There is no magic in language transparency, of course. If a SOAP-based web service written in Java can have a Perl or a Ruby consumer, there must be an intermediary that handles the differences in data types between the service and the requester languages. XML technologies, which support structured document interchange and processing, act as the intermediary. For example, in a typical SOAP-based web service, a client transparently sends a SOAP document as a request to a web service, which transpar- ently returns another SOAP document as a response. In a REST-style service, a client might send a standard HTTP request to a web service and receive an appropriate XML document as a response. Several features distinguish web services from other distributed software systems. Here are three:  Open infrastructure  Web services are deployed using industry-standard, vendor-independent protocols such as HTTP and XML, which are ubiquitous and well understood. Web services  2  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Service client  SOAP-based service  SOAP libraries  SOAP libraries  Request  Response  Download at Boykma.Com   can piggyback on networking, data formatting, security, and other infrastructures already in place, which lowers entry costs and promotes interoperability among services.  Language transparency  Web services and their clients can interoperate even if written in different pro- gramming languages. Languages such as C C++, C, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, and  others  provide  libraries,  utilities,  and  even  frameworks  in  support  of  web services.  Modular design  Web services are meant to be modular in design so that new services can be gen- erated through the integration and layering of existing services. Imagine, for ex- ample, an inventory-tracking service integrated with an online ordering service to yield a service that automatically orders the appropriate products in response to inventory levels.  What Good Are Web Services? This obvious question has no simple, single answer. Nonetheless, the chief benefits and promises of web services are clear. Modern software systems are written in a variety of languages—a variety that seems likely to increase. These software systems will continue to be hosted on a variety of platforms. Institutions large and small have significant investment in legacy software systems whose functionality is useful and perhaps mis- sion critical; and few of these institutions have the will and the resources, human or financial, to rewrite their legacy systems. It is rare that a software system gets to run in splendid isolation. The typical software system must interoperate with others, which may reside on different hosts and be writ- ten in different languages. Interoperability is not just a long-term challenge but also a current requirement of production software. Web services address these issues directly because such services are, first and foremost, language- and platform-neutral. If a legacy COBOL system is exposed through a web service, the system is thereby interoperable with service clients written in other pro- gramming languages. Web services are inherently distributed systems that communicate mostly over HTTP but can communicate over other popular transports as well. The communication pay- loads of web services are structured text  that is, XML documents , which can be in- spected, transformed, persisted, and otherwise processed with widely and even freely available tools. When efficiency demands it, however, web services also can deliver binary payloads. Finally, web services are a work in progress with real-world distributed systems as their test bed. For all of these reasons, web services are an essential tool in any modern programmer’s toolbox.  What Are Web Services?   3  Download at Boykma.Com   The examples that follow, in this chapter and the others, are meant to be simple enough to isolate critical features of web services but also realistic enough to illustrate the power and flexibility that such services bring to software development. Let the examples begin.  A First Example The first example is a SOAP-based web service in Java and clients in Perl, Ruby, and Java. The Java-based web service consists of an interface and an implementation.  The Service Endpoint Interface and Service Implementation Bean The first web service in Java, like almost all of the others in this book, can be compiled and deployed using core Java SE 6  Java Standard Edition 6  or greater without any additional software. All of the libraries required to compile, execute, and consume web services are available in core Java 6, which supports JAX-WS  Java API for XML-Web Services . JAX-WS supports SOAP-based and REST-style services. JAX-WS is com- monly shortened to JWS for Java Web Services. The current version of JAX-WS is 2.x, which is a bit confusing because version 1.x has a different label: JAX-RPC. JAX-WS preserves but also significantly extends the capabilities of JAX-RPC. A SOAP-based web service could be implemented as a single Java class but, following best practices, there should be an interface that declares the methods, which are the web service operations, and an implementation, which defines the methods declared in the interface. The interface is called the SEI: Service Endpoint Interface. The imple- mentation  is  called  the  SIB:  Service  Implementation  Bean.  The  SIB  can  be  either  a POJO or a Stateless Session EJB  Enterprise Java Bean . Chapter 6, which deals with the GlassFish Application Server, shows how to implement a web service as an EJB. Until then, the SOAP-based web services will be implemented as POJOs, that is, as instances of regular Java classes. These web services will be published using library classes  that  come  with  core  Java  6  and,  a  bit  later,  with  standalone  Tomcat  and GlassFish.  Core Java 6, JAX-WS, and Metro  Java SE 6 ships with JAX-WS. However, JAX-WS has a life outside of core Java 6 and a separate development team. The bleeding edge of JAX-WS is the Metro Web Services Stack  https:  wsit.dev.java.net , which includes Project Tango to promote interopera- bility between the Java platform and WCF  Windows Communication Foundation , also known as Indigo. The interoperability initiative goes by the acronym WSIT  Web Services Interoperability Technologies . In any case, the current Metro version of JAX- WS, hereafter the Metro release, is typically ahead of the JAX-WS that ships with the core Java 6 SDK. With Update 4, the JAX-WS in core Java 6 went from JAX-WS 2.0 to JAX-WS 2.1, a significant improvement.  The frequent Metro releases fix bugs, add features, lighten the load on the programmer, and in general strengthen JAX-WS. At the start my goal is to introduce JAX-WS with  4  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com   as little fuss as possible; for now, then, the JAX-WS that comes with core Java 6 is just fine. From time to time an example may involve more work than is needed under the current Metro release; in such cases, the idea is to explain what is really going on before introducing a Metro shortcut.  The Metro home page provides an easy download. Once installed, the Metro release resides in a directory named jaxws-ri. Subsequent examples that use the Metro release assume an environment variable METRO_HOME, whose value is the install directory for jaxws-ri. The ri, by the way, is short for reference implementation.  Finally,  the  downloaded  Metro  release  is  a  way  to  do  JAX-WS  under  core  Java  5. JAX-WS requires at least core Java 5 because support for annotations begins with core Java 5.  Example 1-1 is the SEI for a web service that returns the current time as either a string or as the elapsed milliseconds from the Unix epoch, midnight January 1, 1970 GMT.  Example 1-1. Service Endpoint Interface for the TimeServer  package ch01.ts;     time server  import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.Style;   **  *  The annotation @WebService signals that this is the  *  SEI  Service Endpoint Interface . @WebMethod signals   *  that each method is a service operation.  *  *  The @SOAPBinding annotation impacts the under-the-hood  *  construction of the service contract, the WSDL  *   Web Services Definition Language  document. Style.RPC  *  simplifies the contract and makes deployment easier. *  @WebService @SOAPBinding style = Style.RPC     more on this later public interface TimeServer {     @WebMethod String getTimeAsString  ;     @WebMethod long getTimeAsElapsed  ; }  Example 1-2 is the SIB, which implements the SEI.  Example 1-2. Service Implementation Bean for the TimeServer  package ch01.ts;   import java.util.Date; import javax.jws.WebService;  A First Example  5  Download at Boykma.Com    **  *  The @WebService property endpointInterface links the  *  SIB  this class  to the SEI  ch01.ts.TimeServer .  *  Note that the method implementations are not annotated  *  as @WebMethods. *  @WebService endpointInterface = "ch01.ts.TimeServer"  public class TimeServerImpl implements TimeServer {     public String getTimeAsString   { return new Date  .toString  ; }     public long getTimeAsElapsed   { return new Date  .getTime  ; } }  The two files are compiled in the usual way from the current working directory, which in this case is immediately above the subdirectory ch01. The symbol % represents the command prompt:  % javac ch01 ts *.java  A Java Application to Publish the Web Service Once the SEI and SIB have been compiled, the web service is ready to be published. In full production mode, a Java Application Server such as BEA WebLogic, GlassFish, JBoss, or WebSphere might be used; but in development and even light production mode, a simple Java application can be used. Example 1-3 is the publisher application for the TimeServer service.  Example 1-3. Endpoint publisher for the TimeServer  package ch01.ts;  import javax.xml.ws.Endpoint;   **  * This application publishes the web service whose  * SIB is ch01.ts.TimeServerImpl. For now, the   * service is published at network address 127.0.0.1.,  * which is localhost, and at port number 9876, as this  * port is likely available on any desktop machine. The  * publication path is  ts, an arbitrary name.  *  * The Endpoint class has an overloaded publish method.  * In this two-argument version, the first argument is the  * publication URL as a string and the second argument is  * an instance of the service SIB, in this case  * ch01.ts.TimeServerImpl.  *  * The application runs indefinitely, awaiting service requests.  * It needs to be terminated at the command prompt with control-C  * or the equivalent.  *  * Once the applicatation is started, open a browser to the URL  *  6  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com    *     http:  127.0.0.1:9876 ts?wsdl  *  * to view the service contract, the WSDL document. This is an  * easy test to determine whether the service has deployed  * successfully. If the test succeeds, a client then can be  * executed against the service. *  public class TimeServerPublisher {     public static void main String[ ] args  {          1st argument is the publication URL          2nd argument is an SIB instance       Endpoint.publish "http:  127.0.0.1:9876 ts", new TimeServerImpl   ;     } }  Once compiled, the publisher can be executed in the usual way:  % java ch01.ts.TimeServerPublisher  How the Endpoint Publisher Handles Requests Out of the box, the Endpoint publisher handles one client request at a time. This is fine for getting web services up and running in development mode. However, if the processing of a given request should hang, then all other client requests are effectively blocked. An example at the end of this chapter shows how Endpoint can handle requests concurrently so that one hung request does not block the others.  Testing the Web Service with a Browser We can test the deployed service by opening a browser and viewing the WSDL  Web Service Definition Language  document, which is an automatically generated service contract.  WSDL is pronounced “whiz dull.”  The browser is opened to a URL that has two parts. The first part is the URL published in the Java TimeServerPublisher appli- cation:  http:  127.0.0.1:9876 ts.  Appended  to  this  URL  is  the  query  string  ?wsdl  in upper-,  lower-,  or  mixed  case.  The  result  is  http:  127.0.0.1:9876 ts?wsdl.  Exam- ple 1-4 is the WSDL document that the browser displays.  Example 1-4. WSDL document for the TimeServer service    <definitions      xmlns="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org wsdl "      xmlns:tns="http:  ts.ch01 "      xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"      xmlns:soap="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org wsdl soap "      targetNamespace="http:  ts.ch01 "      name="TimeServerImplService">                 A First Example  7  Download at Boykma.Com                                                                                                                  <soap:binding style="rpc"                    transport="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap http">                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 2 examines the WSDL in detail and introduces Java utilities associated with the service contract. For now, two sections of the WSDL  both shown in bold  deserve a quick look. The portType section, near the top, groups the operations that the web service  delivers,  in  this  case  the  operations  getTimeAsString  and  getTimeAsElapsed, which are the two Java methods declared in the SEI and implemented in the SIB. The  8  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com   WSDL portType is like a Java interface in that the portType presents the service opera- tions  abstractly  but  provides  no  implementation  detail.  Each  operation  in  the  web service consists of an input and an output message, where input means input for the web service. At runtime, each message is a SOAP document. The other WSDL section of interest is the last, the service section, and in particular the service location, in this case  the  URL  http:  localhost:9876 ts.  The  URL  is  called  the  service  endpoint  and  it informs clients about where the service can be accessed. The WSDL document is useful for both creating and executing clients against a web service.  Various  languages  have  utilities  for  generating  client-support  code  from  a WSDL. The core Java utility is now called wsimport but the earlier names wsdl2java and java2wsdl were more descriptive. At runtime, a client can consume the WSDL document associated with a web service in order to get critical information about the data types associated with the operations bundled in the service. For example, a client could determine from our first WSDL that the operation getTimeAsElapsed returns an integer and expects no arguments. The WSDL also can be accessed with various utilities such as curl. For example, the command:  % curl http:  localhost:9876 ts?wsdl  also displays the WSDL.  Avoiding a Subtle Problem in the Web Service Implementation  This example departs from the all-too-common practice of having the service’s SIB  the class TimeServerImpl  connected to the SEI  the interface TimeServer  only through the endpointInterface attribute in the @WebService annotation. It is not unusual to see this:  @WebService endpointInterface = "ch01.ts.TimeServer"  public class TimeServerImpl {    implements TimeServer removed   The style is popular but unsafe. It is far better to have the implements clause so that the compiler checks whether the SIB implements the methods declared in the SEI. Remove the  implements  clause  and  comment  out  the  definitions  of  the  two  web  service operations:  @WebService endpointInterface = "ch01.ts.TimeServer"  public class TimeServerImpl {        public String getTimeAsString   { return new Date  .toString  ; }        public long gettimeAsElapsed   { return new Date  .getTime  ; } }  The code still compiles. With the implements clause in place, the compiler issues a fatal error because the SIB fails to define the methods declared in the SEI.  A First Example  9  Download at Boykma.Com   A Perl and a Ruby Requester of the Web Service To illustrate the language transparency of web services, the first client against the Java- based web service is not in Java but rather in Perl. The second client is in Ruby. Ex- ample 1-5 is the Perl client.  Example 1-5. Perl client for the TimeServer client  ! usr bin perl -w  use SOAP::Lite; my $url = 'http:  127.0.0.1:9876 ts?wsdl'; my $service = SOAP::Lite->service $url ;  print "\nCurrent time is: ", $service->getTimeAsString  ; print "\nElapsed milliseconds from the epoch: ", $service->getTimeAsElapsed  ;  On a sample run, the output was:  Current time is: Thu Oct 16 21:37:35 CDT 2008 Elapsed milliseconds from the epoch: 1224211055700  The Perl module SOAP::Lite provides the under-the-hood functionality that allows the client to issue the appropriate SOAP request and to process the resulting SOAP re- sponse. The request URL, the same URL used to test the web service in the browser, ends with a query string that asks for the WSDL document. The Perl client gets the WSDL document from which the SOAP::Lite library then generates the appropriate service object  in Perl syntax, the scalar variable $service . By consuming the WSDL document, the SOAP::Lite library gets the information needed, in particular, the names of the web service operations and the data types involved in these operations.  Fig- ure 1-2 depicts the architecture.  Figure 1-2. Architecture of the Perl client and Java service  After the setup, the Perl client invokes the web service operations without any fuss. The SOAP messages remain unseen. Example 1-6 is a Ruby client that is functionally equivalent to the Perl client.  10  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Perl client  TimeServer service  SOAP::Lite library  JAX-WS library  Download at Boykma.Com   Example 1-6. Ruby client for the TimeServer client  ! usr bin ruby   one Ruby package for SOAP-based services require 'soap wsdlDriver'   wsdl_url = 'http:  127.0.0.1:9876 ts?wsdl'  service = SOAP::WSDLDriverFactory.new wsdl_url .create_rpc_driver   Save request response messages in files named '...soapmsgs...' service.wiredump_file_base = 'soapmsgs'   Invoke service operations. result1 = service.getTimeAsString result2 = service.getTimeAsElapsed   Output results. puts "Current time is: {result1}" puts "Elapsed milliseconds from the epoch: {result2}"  The Hidden SOAP In SOAP-based web services, a client typically makes a remote procedure call against the service by invoking one of the web service operations. As mentioned earlier, this back and forth between the client and service is the request response message exchange pattern, and the SOAP messages exchanged in this pattern allow the web service and a consumer to be programmed in different languages. We now look more closely at what happens under the hood in our first example. The Perl client generates an HTTP request, which is itself a formatted message whose body is a SOAP message. Exam- ple 1-7 is the HTTP request from a sample run.  Example 1-7. HTTP request for the TimeServer service  POST http:  127.0.0.1:9876 ts HTTP  1.1 Accept: text xml Accept: multipart * Accept: application soap User-Agent: SOAP::Lite Perl 0.69 Content-Length: 434 Content-Type: text xml; charset=utf-8 SOAPAction: ""    <soap:Envelope      soap:encodingStyle="http:   schemas.xmlsoap.org soap encoding "      xmlns:soap="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap  envelope "      xmlns:soapenc="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap encoding "      xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"      xmlns:tns="http:  ts.ch01 "  The Hidden SOAP  11  Download at Boykma.Com        xmlns:xsd ="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema">                  The HTTP request is a message with a structure of its own. In particular:    The HTTP start line comes first and specifies the request method, in this case the POST method, which is typical of requests for dynamic resources such as web services or other web application code  for example, a Java servlet  as opposed to requests for a static HTML page. In this case, a POST rather than a GET request is needed because only a POST request has a body, which encapsulates the SOAP message. Next comes the request URL followed by the HTTP version, in this case 1.1, that the requester understands. HTTP 1.1 is the current version.    Next come the HTTP headers, which are key value pairs in which a colon  :  sep- arates the key from the value. The order of the key value pairs is arbitrary. The key Accept occurs three times, with a MIME  Multiple Internet Mail Extension  type  subtype as the value: text xml, multipart *, and application soap. These three pairs  signal  that  the  requester  is  ready  to  accept  an  arbitrary  XML  response,  a response with arbitrarily many attachments of any type  a SOAP message can have arbitrarily many attachments , and a SOAP document, respectively. The HTTP key SOAPAction is often present in the HTTP header of a web service request and the key’s value may be the empty string, as in this case; but the value also might be the name of the requested web service operation.    Two CRLF  Carriage Return Line Feed  characters, which correspond to two Java \n characters, separate the HTTP headers from the HTTP body, which is required for the POST verb but may be empty. In this case, the HTTP body contains the SOAP document, commonly called the SOAP envelope because the outermost or document element is named Envelope. In this SOAP envelope, the SOAP body con- tains a single element whose local name is getTimeAsString, which is the name of the web service operation that the client wants to invoke. The SOAP request en- velope  is  simple  in  this  example  because  the  requested  operation  takes  no arguments.  On the web service side, the underlying Java libraries process the HTTP request, extract the SOAP envelope, determine the identity of the requested service operation, invoke the corresponding Java method getTimeAsString, and then generate the appropriate SOAP message to carry the method’s return value back to the client. Example 1-8 is the  HTTP  response  from  the  Java  TimeServerImpl  service  request  shown  in  Exam- ple 1-7.  Example 1-8. HTTP response from the TimeServer service  HTTP 1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 323 Content-Type: text xml; charset=utf-8  12  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com   Client-Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2008 02:12:54 GMT Client-Peer: 127.0.0.1:9876 Client-Response-Num: 1    <soapenv:Envelope     xmlns:soapenv="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "     xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema">                  Mon Apr 28 14:12:54 CST 2008               Once again the SOAP envelope is the body of an HTTP message, in this case the HTTP response to the client. The HTTP start line now contains the status code as the integer 200 and the corresponding text OK, which signal that the client request was handled successfully. The SOAP envelope in the HTTP response’s body contains the current time as a string between the XML start and end tags named return. The Perl SOAP library extracts the SOAP envelope from the HTTP response and, because of informa- tion in the WSDL document, expects the desired return value from the web service operation to occur in the XML return element.  A Java Requester of the Web Service Example 1-9 is a Java client functionally equivalent to the Perl and Ruby clients shown in Examples 1-5 and 1-6, respectively.  Example 1-9. Java client for the Java web service  package ch01.ts;  import javax.xml.namespace.QName; import javax.xml.ws.Service; import java.net.URL; class TimeClient {     public static void main String args[ ]  throws Exception {         URL url = new URL "http:  localhost:9876 ts?wsdl" ;             Qualified name of the service:              1st arg is the service URI              2nd is the service name published in the WSDL         QName qname = new QName "http:  ts.ch01 ", "TimeServerImplService" ;             Create, in effect, a factory for the service.         Service service = Service.create url, qname ;             Extract the endpoint interface, the service "port".         TimeServer eif = service.getPort TimeServer.class ;  A Java Requester of the Web Service  13  Download at Boykma.Com           System.out.println eif.getTimeAsString   ;         System.out.println eif.getTimeAsElapsed   ;    } }  The Java client uses the same URL with a query string as do the Perl and Ruby clients, but  the  Java  client  explicitly  creates  an  XML  qualified  name,  which  has  the  syntax namespace URI:local name. A URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier and differs from the more common URL in that a URL specifies a location, whereas a URI need not specify a location. In short, a URI need not be a URL. For now, it is enough to under- score that the Java class java.xml.namespace.QName represents an XML-qualified name. In this example, the namespace URI is provided in the WSDL, and the local name is the SIB class name TimeServerImpl with the word Service appended. The local name occurs in the service section, the last section of the WSDL document. Once the URL and QName objects have been constructed and the Service.create method has been invoked, the statement of interest:  TimeServer port = service.getPort TimeServer.class ;  executes. Recall that, in the WSDL document, the portType section describes, in the style of an interface, the operations included in the web service. The getPort method returns a reference to a Java object that can invoke the portType operations. The port object reference is of type ch01.ts.TimeServer, which is the SEI type. The Java client, like the Perl client, invokes the two web service methods; and the Java libraries, like the Perl and Ruby libraries, generate and process the SOAP messages exchanged trans- parently to enable the successful method invocations.  Wire-Level Tracking of HTTP and SOAP Messages Example 1-7 and Example 1-8 show an HTTP request message and an HTTP response message, respectively. Each HTTP message encapsulates a SOAP envelope. These mes- sage traces were done with the Perl client by changing the Perl use directive in Exam- ple 1-5:  use SOAP::Lite;  to:  use SOAP::Lite +trace;  The Ruby client in Example 1-6 contains a line:  service.wiredump_file_base = 'soapmsgs'  that causes the SOAP envelopes to be saved in files on the local disk. It is possible to capture the wire-level traffic directly in Java as well, as later examples illustrate. Various options are available for tracking SOAP and HTTP messages at the wire level. Here is a short introduction to some of them.  14  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com   The tcpmon utility  available at https:  tcpmon.dev.java.net  is free and downloads as an executable JAR file. Its graphical user interface  GUI  is easy to use. The utility requires only three settings: the server’s name, which defaults to localhost; the server’s port, which would be set to 9876 for the TimeServer example because this is the port at which Endpoint publishes the service; and the local port, which defaults to 8080 and is the port at which tcpmon listens. With tcpmon in use, the TimeClient would send its requests to port 8080 instead of port 9876. The tcpmon utility intercepts HTTP traffic between the client and web service, displaying the full messages in its GUI. The Metro release has utility classes for tracking HTTP and SOAP traffic. This approach does not require any change to the client or to the service code; however, an additional package must be put on the classpath and a system property must be set either at the command  line  or  in  code.  The  required  package  is  in  the  file  jaxws_ri jaxws-rt.jar. Assuming that the environment variable METRO_HOME points to the jaxws-ri directory, here is the command that tracks HTTP and SOAP traffic between the TimeClient, which connects to the service on port 9876, and the TimeServer service.  Under Windows, $METRO_HOME becomes %METRO_HOME%.  The command is on three lines for readability:  % java -cp ".":$METRO_HOME lib jaxws-rt.jar \   -Dcom.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.client.HttpTransportPipe.dump=true \   ch01.ts.TimeClient      The resulting dump shows all of the SOAP traffic but not all of the HTTP headers. Message tracking also can be done on the service side. There are various other open source and commercial products available for tracking the SOAP traffic. Among the products that are worth a look at are SOAPscope  http:   home.mindreef.com ,  NetSniffer   http:  www.miray.de ,  and  Wireshark   http:  www .wireshark.org . The tcpdump utility comes with most Unix-type systems, including Linux  and  OS  X,  and  is  available  on  Windows  as  WinDump   http:  www.winpcap .org . Besides being free, tcpdump is nonintrusive in that it requires no change to either a web service or a client. The tcpdump utility dumps message traffic to the standard output. The companion utility tcptrace  http:  www.tcptrace.org  can be used to analyze the dump. The remainder of this section briefly covers tcpdump as a flexible and pow- erful trace utility. Under  Unix-type  systems,  the  tcpdump  utility  typically  must  be  executed  as  super- user. There are various flagged arguments that determine how the utility works. Here is a sample invocation:  % tcpdump -i lo -A -s 1024 -l 'dst host localhost and port 9876'  tee dump.log  The utility can capture packets on any network interface. A list of such interfaces is available with the tcpdump -D  under Windows, WinDump -D , which is equivalent to the  ifconfig  -a  command  on  Unix-like  systems.  In  this  example,  the  flag value  pair -i lo means capture packets from the interface lo, where lo is short for the localhost network interface on many Unix-like systems. The flag  -A means that the captured packets should be presented in ASCII, which is useful for web packets as these typically  Wire-Level Tracking of HTTP and SOAP Messages   15  Download at Boykma.Com   contain text. The -s 1024 flag sets the snap length, the number of bytes that should be captured from each packet. The flag -l forces the standard output to be line buffered and easier to read; and, on the same theme, the construct  tee dump.log at the end pipes the same output that shows up on the screen  the standard output  into a local file named dump.log. Finally, the expression:  'dst host localhost and port 9876'  acts as a filter, capturing only packets whose destination is localhost on port 9876, the port on which TimeServerPublisher of Example 1-3 publishes the TimeServer service. The  tcpdump  utility  and  the  TimeServerPublisher  application  can  be  started  in  any order. Once both are running, the TimeClient or one of the other clients can be execu- ted. With the sample use of tcpdump shown above, the underlying network packets are saved in the file dump.log. The file does require some editing to make it easily readable. In any case, the dump.log file captures the same SOAP envelopes shown in Examples 1-7 and 1-8.  What’s Clear So Far? The  first  example  is  a  web  service  with  two  operations,  each  of  which  delivers  the current time but in different representations: in one case as a human-readable string, and in the other case as the elapsed milliseconds from the Unix epoch. The two oper- ations are implemented as independent, self-contained methods. From the service re- quester’s perspective, either method may be invoked independently of the other and one invocation of a service method has no impact on any subsequent invocation of the same service method. The two Java methods depend neither on one another nor on any instance field to which both have access; indeed, the SIB class TimeServerImpl has no fields at all. In short, the two method invocations are stateless. In the first example, neither method expects arguments. In general, web service oper- ations  may  be  parameterized  so  that  appropriate  information  can  be  passed  to  the operation as part of the service request. Regardless of whether the web service opera- tions are parameterized, they still should appear to the requester as independent and self-contained. This design principle will guide all of the samples that we consider, even ones that are richer than the first.  Key Features of the First Code Example The  TimeServerImpl  class  implements  a  web  service  with  a  distinctive  message exchange  pattern   MEP —request response.  The  service  allows  a  client  to  make  a language-neutral remote procedure call, invoking the methods getTimeAsString and getTimeAsElapsed. Other message patterns are possible. Imagine, for example, a web service that tracks new snow amounts for ski areas. Some participating clients, perhaps snow-measuring electrical devices strategically placed around the ski slopes, might use the  one-way  pattern  by  sending  a  snow  amount  from  a  particular  location  but  16  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com   without expecting a response from the service. The service might exhibit the notifica- tion pattern by multicasting to subscribing clients  for instance, travel bureaus  infor- mation about current snow conditions. Finally, the service might periodically use the solicit response pattern to ask a subscribing client whether the client wishes to continue receiving notifications. In summary, SOAP-based web services support various pat- terns. The request response pattern of RPC remains the dominant one. The infrastruc- ture needed to support this pattern in particular is worth summarizing:  Message transport  SOAP is designed to be transport-neutral, a design goal that complicates matters because SOAP messages cannot rely on protocol-specific information included in the transport infrastructure. For instance, SOAP delivered over HTTP should not differ  from  SOAP  delivered  over  some  other  transport  protocol  such  as  SMTP  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol , FTP  File Transfer Protocol , or even JMS  Java Message Service . In practice, however, HTTP is the usual transport for SOAP- based services, a point underscored in the usual name: SOAP-based web services.  Service contract  The service client requires information about the service’s operations in order to invoke them. In particular, the client needs information about the invocation syn- tax:  the  operation’s  name,  the  order  and  types  of  the  arguments  passed  to  the operation, and the type of the returned value. The client also requires the service endpoint, typically the service URL. The WSDL document provides these pieces of information and others. Although a client could invoke a service without first accessing the WSDL, this would make things harder than they need to be.  Type system  The key to language neutrality and, therefore, service consumer interoperability is a shared type system so that the data types used in the client’s invocation coordinate with the types used in the service operation. Consider a simple example. Suppose that a Java web service has the operation:  boolean bytes_ok byte[ ] some_bytes   The bytes_ok operation performs some validation test on the bytes passed to the operation as an array argument, returning either true or false. Now assume that a client written in C needs to invoke bytes_ok. C has no types named boolean and byte. C represents boolean values with integers, with nonzero as true and zero as false; and the C type signed char corresponds to the Java type byte. A web service would be cumbersome to consume if clients had to map client-language types to service-language types. In SOAP-based web services, the XML Schema type system is the default type system that mediates between the client’s types and the service’s types. In the example above, the XML Schema type xsd:byte is the type that me- diates between the C signed char and the Java byte; and the XML Schema type xsd:boolean is the mediating type for the C integers nonzero and zero and the Java boolean  values  true  and  false.  In  the  notation  xsd:byte,  the  prefix  xsd   XML Schema Definition  underscores that this is an XML Schema type because xsd is  What’s Clear So Far?   17  Download at Boykma.Com   the usual extension for a file that contains an XML Schema definition; for instance, purchaseOrder.xsd.  Java’s SOAP API A major appeal of SOAP-based web services is that the SOAP usually remains hidden. Nonetheless, it may be useful to glance at Java’s underlying support for generating and processing  SOAP  messages.  Chapter  3,  which  introduces  SOAP  handlers,  puts  the SOAP API to practical use. This section provides a first look at the SOAP API through a simulation example. The application consists of one class, DemoSoap, but simulates sending  a  SOAP  message  as  a  request  and  receiving  another  as  a  response.  Exam- ple 1-10 shows the full application.  Example 1-10.

In this case, only the  optional  message header is used             and the body is empty.

The DemoSoap application’s request method generates a SOAP message and adds the string time_request to the SOAP envelope’s header. The code segment, with comments removed, is:  SOAPMessage msg = create_soap_message  ; SOAPEnvelope env = msg.getSOAPPart  .getEnvelope  ; SOAPHeader hdr = env.getHeader  ; Name lookup_name = create_qname msg ; hdr.addHeaderElement lookup_name .addTextNode "time_request" ;  There are two basic ways to create a SOAP message. The simple way is illustrated in this code segment:  MessageFactory mf = MessageFactory.newInstance  ; SOAPMessage msg = mf.createMessage  ;  In the more complicated way, the MessageFactory code is the same, but the creation call becomes:  SOAPMessage msg = mf.createMessage mime_headers, input_stream ;  The first argument to createMessage is a collection of the transport-layer headers  for instance, the key value pairs that make up an HTTP header , and the second argument is an input stream that provides the bytes to create the message  for instance, the input stream encapsulated in a Java Socket instance .  Java’s SOAP API   21  Download at Boykma.Com   Once the SOAP message is created, the header is extracted from the SOAP envelope and an XML text node is inserted with the value time_request. The resulting SOAP message is:  <SOAP-ENV:Envelope      xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope ">                      time_request                      There is no need right now to examine every detail of this SOAP message. Here is a summary of some key points. The SOAP body is always required but, as in this case, the body may be empty. The SOAP header is optional but, in this case, the header contains the text time_request. Message contents such as time_request normally would be placed in the SOAP body and special processing information  for instance, user authentication data  would be placed in the header. The point here is to illustrate how the SOAP header and the SOAP body can be manipulated. The request method writes the SOAP message to a ByteArrayOutputStream, which sim- ulates sending the message over a network connection to a receiver on a different host. The request method invokes the process_request method, which in turn delegates the remaining tasks to other methods. The processing goes as follows. The received SOAP message is created from a ByteArrayInputStream, which simulates an input stream on the receiver’s side; this stream contains the sent SOAP message. The SOAP message now is created from the input stream:  SOAPMessage msg = null; try {    MessageFactory mf = MessageFactory.newInstance  ;    msg = mf.createMessage null,    ignore MIME headers                           in ;     stream source  ByteArrayInputStream  }    and then the SOAP message is processed to extract the time_request string. The ex- traction goes as follows. First, the SOAP header is extracted from the SOAP message and an iterator over the elements with the tag name:     is created. In this example, there is one element with this tag name and the element should contain the string time_request. The lookup code is:  SOAPHeader header = msg.getSOAPHeader  ; Iterator it = header.getChildElements lookup_name ; Node next =  Node  it.next  ; String value =  next == null  ? "Error!" : next.getValue  ;  If the SOAP header contains the proper request string, the SOAP body is extracted from the incoming SOAP message and an element containing the current time as a string is  22  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com   added to the SOAP body. The revised SOAP message then is sent as a response. Here is the code segment with the comments removed:  if  value.toLowerCase  .contains "time_request"   {   String now = new Date  .toString  ;   SOAPBody body = msg.getSOAPBody  ;   body.addBodyElement lookup_name .addTextNode now ;   msg.saveChanges  ;    msg.writeTo out ;   trace "The received processed SOAP message:", msg ; }  The outgoing SOAP message on a sample run was:  <SOAP-ENV:Envelope        xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope ">                         time_request                                       Mon Oct 27 14:45:53 CDT 2008                  This example provides a first look at Java’s API. Later examples illustrate production- level use of the SOAP API.  An Example with Richer Data Types The operations in the TimeServer service take no arguments and return simple types, a string and an integer. This section offers a richer example whose details are clarified in the next chapter. The Teams web service in Example 1-11 differs from the TimeServer service in several important ways.  Example 1-11. The Teams document-style web service  package ch01.team;  import java.util.List; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod;  @WebService public class Teams {     private TeamsUtility utils;  An Example with Richer Data Types   23  Download at Boykma.Com       public Teams   {         utils = new TeamsUtility  ;         utils.make_test_teams  ;     }      @WebMethod     public Team getTeam String name  { return utils.getTeam name ; }      @WebMethod     public List  getTeams   { return utils.getTeams  ; } }  For one, the Teams service is implemented as a single Java class rather than as a separate SEI and SIB. This is done simply to illustrate the possibility. A more important differ- ence is in the return types of the two Teams operations. The operation getTeam is para- meterized and returns an object of the programmer-defined type Team, which is a list of Player instances, another programmer-defined type. The operation getTeams returns a List , that is, a Java Collection. The utility class TeamsUtility generates the data. In a production environment, this utility might retrieve a team or list of teams from a database. To keep this example simple, the utility instead creates the teams and their players on the fly. Here is part of the utility:  package ch01.team;  import java.util.Set; import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Map; import java.util.HashMap;  public class TeamsUtility {     private Map  team_map;      public TeamsUtility   {        team_map = new HashMap   ;     }      public Team getTeam String name  { return team_map.get name ; }     public List  getTeams   {        List  list = new ArrayList   ;        Set  keys = team_map.keySet  ;        for  String key : keys            list.add team_map.get key  ;        return list;     }      public void make_test_teams   {        List  teams = new ArrayList   ;        ...        Player chico = new Player "Leonard Marx", "Chico" ;        Player groucho = new Player "Julius Marx", "Groucho" ;  24  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com          Player harpo = new Player "Adolph Marx", "Harpo" ;        List  mb = new ArrayList   ;        mb.add chico ; mb.add groucho ; mb.add harpo ;        Team marx_brothers = new Team "Marx Brothers", mb ;        teams.add marx_brothers ;         store_teams teams ;      }      private void store_teams List  teams  {        for  Team team : teams            team_map.put team.getName  , team ;     } }  Publishing the Service and Writing a Client Recall that the SEI for the TimeServer service contains the annotation:  @SOAPBinding style = Style.RPC    This annotation requires that the service use only very simple types such as string and integer.  By  contrast,  the  Teams  service  uses  richer  data  types,  which  means  that Style.DOCUMENT, the default, should replace Style.RPC. The document style does re- quire more setup, which is given below but not explained until the next chapter. Here, then, are the steps required to get the web service deployed and a sample client written quickly:  1. The source files are compiled in the usual way. From the working directory, which  has ch01 as a subdirectory, the command is:  % javac ch01 team *.java  In addition to the @WebService-annotated Teams class, the ch01 team directory con- tains the Team, Player, TeamsUtility, and TeamsPublisher classes shown below all together:  package ch01.team; public class Player {     private String name;     private String nickname;      public Player   { }     public Player String name, String nickname  {        setName name ;        setNickname nickname ;     }      public void setName String name  { this.name = name; }     public String getName   { return name; }     public void setNickname String nickname  { this.nickname = nickname; }     public String getNickname   { return nickname; } }  An Example with Richer Data Types   25  Download at Boykma.Com      end of Player.java  package ch01.team;  import java.util.List; public class Team {     private List  players;     private String name;          public Team   { }     public Team String name, List  players  {         setName name ;        setPlayers players ;      }      public void setName String name  { this.name = name; }     public String getName   { return name; }     public void setPlayers List  players  { this.players = players; }     public List  getPlayers   { return players; }     public void setRosterCount int n  { }    no-op but needed for property     public int getRosterCount   { return  players == null  ? 0 : players.size  ; }      } }    end of Team.java  package ch01.team; import javax.xml.ws.Endpoint; class TeamsPublisher {     public static void main String[ ] args  {        int port = 8888;        String url = "http:  localhost:" + port + " teams";        System.out.println "Publishing Teams on port " + port ;        Endpoint.publish url, new Teams   ;     } }   2. In the working directory, invoke the wsgen utility, which comes with core Java 6:  % wsgen -cp . ch01.team.Teams  This utility generates various artifacts; that is, Java types needed by the method Endpoint.publish to generate the service’s WSDL. Chapter 2 looks closely at these artifacts and how they contribute to the WSDL.  3. Execute the TeamsPublisher application. 4. In the working directory, invoke the wsimport utility, which likewise comes with  core Java 6:  % wsimport -p teamsC -keep http:  localhost:8888 teams?wsdl  This utility generates various classes in the subdirectory teamsC  the -p flag stands for package . These classes make it easier to write a client against the service.  Step 4 expedites the coding of a client, which is shown here:  26  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com   import teamsC.TeamsService; import teamsC.Teams; import teamsC.Team; import teamsC.Player; import java.util.List;  class TeamClient {     public static void main String[ ] args  {         TeamsService service = new TeamsService  ;         Teams port = service.getTeamsPort  ;         List  teams = port.getTeams  ;         for  Team team : teams  {             System.out.println "Team name: " + team.getName   +                                "  roster count: " + team.getRosterCount   + " " ;             for  Player player : team.getPlayers                    System.out.println "  Player: " + player.getNickname   ;         }     } }  When the client executes, the output is:  Team name: Abbott and Costello  roster count: 2    Player: Bud   Player: Lou Team name: Marx Brothers  roster count: 3    Player: Chico   Player: Groucho   Player: Harpo Team name: Burns and Allen  roster count: 2    Player: George   Player: Gracie  This example hints at what is possible in a commercial-grade, SOAP-based web service. Programmer-defined types such as Player and Team, along with arbitrary collections of these, can be arguments passed to or values returned from a web service so long as certain guidelines are followed. One guideline comes into play in this example. For the Team and the Player classes, the JavaBean properties are of types String or int; and a List, like any Java Collection, has a toArray method. In the end, a List  reduces to arrays of simple types; in this case String instances or int values. The next chapter covers the details, in particular how the wsgen and the wsimport utilities facilitate the development of JWS services and clients.  Multithreading the Endpoint Publisher In the examples so far, the Endpoint publisher has been single-threaded and, therefore, capable of handling only one client request at a time: the published service completes the processing of one request before beginning the processing of another request. If the processing of the current request hangs, then no subsequent request can be processed unless and until the hung request is processed to completion.  Multithreading the Endpoint Publisher   27  Download at Boykma.Com   In production mode, the Endpoint publisher would need to handle concurrent requests so that several pending requests could be processed at the same time. If the underlying computer system is, for example, a symmetric multiprocessor  SMP , then separate CPUs could process different requests concurrently. On a single-CPU machine, the concurrency would occur through time sharing; that is, each request would get a share of the available CPU cycles so that several requests would be in some stage of processing at any given time. In Java, concurrency is achieved through multithreading. At issue, then, is how to make the Endpoint publisher multithreaded. The JWS framework sup- ports Endpoint multithreading without forcing the programmer to work with difficult, error-prone constructs such as the synchronized block or the wait and notify method invocations. An Endpoint object has an Executor property defined with the standard get set meth- ods. An Executor is an object that executes Runnable tasks; for example, standard Java Thread instances.  The Runnable interface declares only one method whose declaration is public void run  .  An Executor object is a nice alternative to Thread instances, as the Executor provides high-level constructs for submitting and managing tasks that are to be executed concurrently. The first step to making the Endpoint publisher multi- threaded is thus to create an Executor class such as the following very basic one:  package ch01.ts;  import java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor; import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock; import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;  public class MyThreadPool extends ThreadPoolExecutor {     private static final int pool_size = 10;     private boolean is_paused;     private ReentrantLock pause_lock = new ReentrantLock  ;     private Condition unpaused = pause_lock.newCondition  ;          public MyThreadPool  {        super pool_size,           core pool size              pool_size,           maximum pool size              0L,                  keep-alive time for idle thread              TimeUnit.SECONDS,    time unit for keep-alive setting              new LinkedBlockingQueue  pool_size  ;    work queue      }         some overrides     protected void beforeExecute Thread t, Runnable r  {        super.beforeExecute t, r ;        pause_lock.lock  ;        try {           while  is_paused  unpaused.await  ;        }  28  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com          catch  InterruptedException e  { t.interrupt  ; }         finally { pause_lock.unlock  ; }     }          public void pause   {        pause_lock.lock  ;        try {           is_paused = true;        }         finally { pause_lock.unlock  ; }     }          public void resume   {        pause_lock.lock  ;        try {           is_paused = false;           unpaused.signalAll  ;        }         finally { pause_lock.unlock  ; }     } }  package ch01.ts;  import javax.xml.ws.Endpoint;  class TimePublisherMT {    MT for multithreaded     private Endpoint endpoint;      public static void main String[ ] args  {         TimePublisherMT self = new TimePublisherMT  ;         self.create_endpoint  ;         self.configure_endpoint  ;         self.publish  ;     }     private void create_endpoint   {         endpoint = Endpoint.create new TimeServerImpl   ;     }     private void configure_endpoint   {         endpoint.setExecutor new MyThreadPool   ;     }  The class MyThreadPool creates a pool of 10 threads, using a fixed-size queue to store the threads that are created under the hood. If the pooled threads are all in use, then the next task in line must wait until one of the busy threads becomes available. All of these management details are handled automatically. The MyThreadPool class overrides a few of the available methods to give the flavor. A MyThreadPool object can be used to make a multithreaded Endpoint publisher. Here is the revised publisher, which now consists of several methods to divide the work:  Multithreading the Endpoint Publisher   29  Download at Boykma.Com       private void publish   {         int port = 8888;         String url = "http:  localhost:" + port + " ts";         endpoint.publish url ;         System.out.println "Publishing TimeServer on port " + port ;     } }      Once the ThreadPoolWorker has been coded, all that remains is to set the Endpoint pub- lisher’s  executor  property  to  an  instance  of  the  worker  class.  The  details  of  thread management do not intrude at all into the publisher. The multithreaded Endpoint publisher is suited for lightweight production, but this publisher is not a service container in the true sense; that is, a software application that readily can deploy many web services at the same port. A web container such as Tomcat, which is the reference implementation, is better suited to publish multiple web services. Tomcat is introduced in later examples.  What’s Next? A SOAP-based web service should provide, as a WSDL document, a service contract for its potential clients. So far we have seen how a Perl, a Ruby, and a Java client can request the WSDL at runtime for use in the underlying SOAP libraries. Chapter 2 stud- ies the WSDL more closely and illustrates how it may be used to generate client-side artifacts such as Java classes, which in turn ease the coding of web service clients. The Java clients in Chapter 2 will not be written from scratch, as is our first Java client. Instead such clients will be written with the considerable aid of the wsimport utility, as was the TeamClient shown earlier. Chapter 2 also introduces JAX-B  Java API for XML- Binding , a collection of Java packages that coordinate Java data types and XML data types. The wsgen utility generates JAX-B artifacts that play a key role in this coordina- tion; hence, wsgen also will get a closer look.  30  Chapter 1: Java Web Services Quickstart  Download at Boykma.Com   CHAPTER 2 All About WSDLs  What Good Is a WSDL? The usefulness of WSDLs, the service contracts for SOAP-based web services, is shown best through examples. The original Java client against the TimeServer service invokes the Service.create method with two arguments: a URL, which provides the endpoint at which the service can be accessed, and an XML-qualified name  a Java QName , which in turn consists of the service’s local name  in this case, TimeServerImplService  and a namespace identifier  in this case, the URI http:  ts.ch01  . Here is the relevant code without the comments:  URL url = new URL "http:  localhost:9876 ts?wsdl" ; QName qname = new QName "http:  ts.ch01 ", "TimeServerImplService" ; Service service = Service.create url, qname ;  Note that the automatically generated namespace URI inverts the package name of the  service implementation bean  SIB , ch01.ts.TimeServerImpl. The package ch01.ts be- comes ts.ch01 in the URI. This detail is critical. If the first argument to the QName con- structor is changed to the URI http:  ch01.ts , the Java TimeClient throws a exception, complaining that the service’s automatically generated WSDL does not describe a serv- ice with this namespace URI. The programmer must figure out the namespace URI— presumably by inspecting the WSDL! By the way, even the trailing slash in the URI is critical.  The  URI  http:  ts.ch01,  with  a  slash  missing  at  the  end,  causes  the  same exception as does http:  ch01.ts , with ch01 and ts in the wrong order. The same point can be illustrated with a revised Perl client, which accesses the web service but without requesting its WSDL, as shown in Example 2-1.  Example 2-1. A revised Perl client for the TimeServer service  ! usr bin perl -w  use SOAP::Lite;  my $endpoint = 'http:  127.0.0.1:9876 ts';  endpoint my $uri      = 'http:  ts.ch01 ';           namespace  31  Download at Boykma.Com   my $client = SOAP::Lite->uri $uri ->proxy $endpoint ;  my $response = $client->getTimeAsString  ->result  ; print $response, "\n"; $response = $client->getTimeAsElapsed  ->result  ; print $response, "\n";  The revised Perl client is functionally equivalent to the original. However, the revised Perl client must specify the service’s namespace URI: http:  ts.ch01 . No other URI would work because the Java-generated WSDL produces exactly this one. In effect, the web service is accessible through a pair: a service endpoint  URL  and a service name- space  URI . It is harder to code the Perl client in Example 2-1 than the original Perl client. The revised client requires the programmer to know the service namespace URI in addition to the service endpoint URL. The original Perl client sidesteps the problem by requesting the WSDL document, which includes the service URI. The original Perl client, which gets the URI from the consumed WSDL document, is the easier way to go.  Generating Client-Support Code from a WSDL Java has a wsimport utility that eases the task of writing a Java client against a SOAP- based web service. The utility generates client-support code or artifacts from the service contract, the WSDL document. At a command prompt, the command:  % wsimport  displays  a  short  report  on  how  the  utility  can  be  used.  The  first  example  with wsimport produces client artifacts against the TimeServer service. After the ch01.ts.TimeServerPublisher application has been started, the command:  % wsimport -keep -p client http:  localhost:9876 ts?wsdl  generates two source and two compiled files in the subdirectory client. The URL at the end—the same one used in the original Perl, Ruby, and Java clients to request the service’s WSDL document—gives the location of the service contract. The option -p specifies the Java package in which the generated files are to be placed, in this case a package named client; the package name is arbitrary and the utility uses or creates a subdirectory with the package name. The option -keep indicates that the source files should be kept, in this case for inspection. The -p option is important because wsim- port generates the file TimeServer.class, which has the same name as the compiled ver- sions of the original service endpoint interface  SEI . If a package is not specified with the wsimport utility, then the default package is the package of the service implemen- tation, in this case ch01.ts. In short, using the -p option prevents the compiled SEI file from being overwritten by the file generated with the wsimport utility. If a local copy of  the  WSDL  document  is  available   for  instance,  the  file  named  ts.wsdl ,  then  the command would be:  % wsimport -keep -p client ts.wsdl  32  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com   Examples 2-2 and 2-3 are the two source files, with comments removed, that the wsim- port command generates.  Example 2-2. The wsimport-generated TimeServer  package client;  import javax.jws.WebMethod; import javax.jws.WebResult; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding;  @WebService name = "TimeServer", targetNamespace = "http:  ts.ch01 "  @SOAPBinding style = SOAPBinding.Style.RPC  public interface TimeServer {     @WebMethod     @WebResult partName = "return"      public String getTimeAsString  ;  Example 2-3. The wsimport-generated TimeServerImplService      @WebMethod     @WebResult partName = "return"      public long getTimeAsElapsed  ; }  package client;  import java.net.MalformedURLException; import java.net.URL; import javax.xml.namespace.QName; import javax.xml.ws.Service; import javax.xml.ws.WebEndpoint; import javax.xml.ws.WebServiceClient;  @WebServiceClient name = "TimeServerImplService",                   targetNamespace = "http:  ts.ch01 ",                   wsdlLocation = "http:  localhost:9876 ts?wsdl"  public class TimeServerImplService extends Service {     private final static URL TIMESERVERIMPLSERVICE_WSDL_LOCATION;      static {         URL url = null;         try {             url = new URL "http:  localhost:9876 ts?wsdl" ;         }         catch  MalformedURLException e  {             e.printStackTrace  ;         }         TIMESERVERIMPLSERVICE_WSDL_LOCATION = url;     }      public TimeServerImplService URL wsdlLocation, QName serviceName  {         super wsdlLocation, serviceName ;     }  What Good Is a WSDL?   33  Download at Boykma.Com       public TimeServerImplService   {         super TIMESERVERIMPLSERVICE_WSDL_LOCATION,               new QName "http:  ts.ch01 ", "TimeServerImplService"  ;     }      @WebEndpoint name = "TimeServerImplPort"      public TimeServer getTimeServerImplPort   {         return  TimeServer super.getPort new QName "http:  ts.ch01 ",                                                    "TimeServerImplPort" ,                                          TimeServer.class ;     } }  Three points about these generated source files deserve mention. First, the interface client.TimeServer declares the very same methods as the original SEI, TimeServer. The methods  are  the  web  service  operation  getTimeAsString  and  the  operation getTimeAsElapsed. Second, the class client.TimeServerImplService has a no-argument constructor  that  constructs  the  very  same  Service  object  as  the  original  Java  client TimeClient.  Third,  TimeServerImplService  encapsulates  the  getTimeServerImplPort method, which returns an instance of type client.TimeServer, which in turn supports invocations of the two web service operations. Together the two generated types, the interface client.TimeServer and the class client.TimeServerImplService, ease the task of writing a Java client against the web service. Example 2-4 shows a client that uses the client-support code from the wsimport utility.  Example 2-4. A Java client that uses wsimport artifacts  package client;  class TimeClientWSDL {     public static void main String[ ] args  {           The TimeServerImplService class is the Java type bound to           the service section of the WSDL document.        TimeServerImplService service = new TimeServerImplService  ;            The TimeServer interface is the Java type bound to           the portType section of the WSDL document.        TimeServer eif = service.getTimeServerImplPort  ;            Invoke the methods.        System.out.println eif.getTimeAsString   ;        System.out.println eif.getTimeAsElapsed   ;     } }  The client in Example 2-4 is functionally equivalent to the original TimeClient, but this client is far easier to write. In particular, troublesome yet critical details such as the  appropriate QName and service endpoint now are hidden in the wsimport-generated class, client.TempServerImplService. The idiom that is illustrated here works in general for  34  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com   writing  clients  with  help  from  WSDL-based  artifacts  such  as  TimeServer  and TimeServerImplService:    First, construct a Service object using one of two constructors in the wsimport- generated class, in this example client.TimeServerImplService. The no-argument constructor is preferable because of its simplicity. However, a two-argument con- structor is also available in case the web service’s namespace  URI  or the service endpoint  URL  have changed. Even in this case, however, it would be advisable to regenerate the WSDL-based Java files with another use of the wsimport utility.   Invoke the get...Port method on the constructed Service object, in this example, the  method  getTimeServerImplPort.  The  method  returns  an  object  that encapsulates  the  web  service  operations,  in  this  case  getTimeAsString  and getTimeAsElapsed, declared in the original SEI.  The @WebResult Annotation The WSDL-based client.TimeServer interface introduces the @WebResult annotation. To  show  how  this  annotation  works,  Example  2-5  is  a  revised  version  of  the ch01.ts.TimeServer SEI  with comments removed .  Example 2-5. A more annotated version of the TimeServer service  package ch01.ts;     time server  import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod; import javax.jws.WebResult; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.Style;  @WebService @SOAPBinding style = Style.RPC     more on this later public interface TimeServer {     @WebMethod     @WebResult partName = "time_response"      String getTimeAsString  ;      @WebMethod     @WebResult partName = "time_response"      long getTimeAsElapsed  ; }  The @WebResult annotates the two web service operations. In the resulting WSDL, the message section reflects this change:                    What Good Is a WSDL?   35  Download at Boykma.Com               Note that time_response now replaces return from the original WDSL. The SOAP re- sponse document from the web service likewise reflects the change:    <soapenv:Envelope     xmlns:soapenv="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "     xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema">                               Thu Mar 27 21:20:09 CDT 2008                        Once again, the time_response tag replaces the return tag from the original SOAP re- sponse. If the @WebResult annotation were applied, say, only to the getTimeAsString operation, then the SOAP response for this operation would use the time_response tag but  the  response  for  the  getTimeAsElapsed  operation  still  would  use  the  default return tag. The point of interest is that various annotations are available to determine what the generated WSDL document will look like. Such annotations will be introduced in small doses. It is easiest to minimize the use of annotations, using only the ones that serve some  critical  purpose.  The  TimeServer  works  exactly  the  same  whether  the time_response or the default return tag is used in the WSDL and in the SOAP response; hence, there is usually no need for programmer-generated code to use the @WebResult annotation. Various commercial-grade WSDLs are available for generating Java support code. An example that will be introduced shortly uses a WSDL from Amazon’s Associates Web Service, more popularly known as Amazon’s E-Commerce service. However, the Am- azon example first requires a closer look at WSDL structure. My plan is to keep the tedious details to a minimum. The goal of the next section is to move from basic WSDL structure to the unofficial but popular distinction between wrapped and unwrapped SOAP message bodies.  WSDL Structure At a high level, a WSDL document is a contract between a service and its consumers. The contract provides such critical information as the service endpoint, the service operations, and the data types required for these operations. The service contract also indicates, in describing the messages exchanged in the service, the underlying service  36  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com   pattern,  for  instance,  request response  or  solicit response.  The  outermost  element  called the document or root element  in a WSDL is named definitions because the WSDL provides definitions grouped into the following sections:    The types section, which is optional, provides data type definitions under some data type system such as XML Schema. A particular document that defines data types is an XSD  XML Schema Definition . The types section holds, points to, or imports an XSD. If the types section is empty, as in the case of the TimeServer service,  then  the  service  uses  only  simple  data  types  such  as  xsd:string  and xsd:long. Although the WSDL 2.0 specification allows for alternatives to XML Schema  see http:  www.w3.org TR wsdl20-altschemalangs , XML Schema is the default and the dominant  type  system  used  in  WSDLs.  Accordingly,  the  following  examples assume XML Schema unless otherwise noted.    The message section defines the messages that implement the service. Messages are constructed from data types either defined in the immediately preceding section or, if the types section is empty, available as defaults. Further, the order of the messages indicates the service pattern. Recall that, for messages, the directional properties in and out are from the service’s perspective: an in message is to the service, whereas an out message is from the service. Accordingly, the message order in out indicates the request response pattern, whereas the message order out in indicates the solicit response pattern. For the TimeServer service, there are four messages: a request and a response for the two operations, getTimeAsString and getTimeAsElapsed. The in out order in each pair indicates a request response pat- tern for the web service operations.    The portType section presents the service as named operations, with each operation as one or more messages. Note that the operations are named after methods an- notated as @WebMethods, a point to be discussed in detail shortly. A web service’s portType is akin to a Java interface in presenting the service abstractly, that is, with no implementation details.    The binding section is where the WSDL definitions go from the abstract to the concrete. A WSDL binding is akin to a Java implementation of an interface  that is, a WSDL portType . Like a Java implementation class, a WSDL binding provides important concrete details about the service. The binding section is the most com- plicated  one  because  it  must  specify  these  implementation  details  of  a  service defined abstractly in the portType section: — The transport protocol to be used in sending and receiving the underlying SOAP messages. Either HTTP or SMTP  Simple Mail Transport Protocol  may be used for what is called the application-layer protocol; that is, the protocol for trans- porting the SOAP messages that implement the service. HTTP is by far the more popular choice. The WSDL for the TimeServer service contains this segment:  <soap:binding style="rpc"               transport="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap http">  WSDL Structure  37  Download at Boykma.Com   The value of the transport attribute signals that the service’s SOAP messages will be sent and received over HTTP, which is captured in the slogan SOAP over HTTP.  — The style of the service, shown earlier as the value of the style attribute, takes either rpc or document as a value. The document style is the default, which explains why the SEI for the TimeServer service contains the annotation:  @SOAPBinding style = Style.RPC              This annotation forces the  style attribute to have the value  rpc in the Java- generated WSDL. The difference between the rpc and the document style will be clarified shortly.  — The  data  format  to  be  used  in  the  SOAP  messages.  There  are  two  choices,  literal and encoded. These choices also will be clarified shortly.    The service section specifies one or more endpoints at which the service’s func- tionality, the sum of its operations, is available. In technical terms, the service section lists one or more port elements, where a port consists of a portType  inter- face   together  with  a  corresponding  binding   implementation .  The  term  port derives from distributed systems. An application hosted at a particular network address  for instance, 127.0.0.1  is available to clients, local or remote, through a specified port. For example, the TimeServer application is available to clients at port 9876.  The tricky part of the binding section involves the possible combinations of the style and  the  use  attributes.  The  next  subsection  looks  more  closely  at  the  relationships between these attributes.  A Closer Look at WSDL Bindings In  the  WSDL  binding  section,  the  style  attribute  has  rpc  and  document  as  possible values, with document as the default. The use attribute has literal and encoded as pos- sible values, with literal as the default. In theory, there are four possibilities, as shown in Table 2-1.  Table 2-1. Possible combinations of style and use  style  use  document  literal  document  encoded  rpc  rpc  literal  encoded  38  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Of the four possible combinations listed in Table 2-1, only two occur regularly in con- temporary  SOAP-based  web  services:  document literal  and  rpc literal.  For  one  Download at Boykma.Com   thing, the encoded use, though valid in a WSDL document, does not comply with the WS-I  Web Services-Interoperability  guidelines  see http:  www.ws-i.org . As the name indicates, the WS-I initiative is meant to help software architects and developers pro- duce web services that can interoperate seamlessly despite differences in platforms and programming languages. Before going any further into the details, it will be helpful to have a sample WSDL for a document-style service, which then can be contrasted with the WSDL for the rpc-style TimeServer service. The use attribute will be clarified after the style attribute. The TimeServer service can be changed to a document-style service in two quick steps. The first is to comment out the line:  @SOAPBinding style = Style.RPC   in the SEI source, ch02.ts.TimeServer.java, before recompiling.  The package has been changed from ch01.ts to ch02.ts to reflect that this is Chapter 2.  Commenting out this annotation means that the default style, Style.DOCUMENT, is in effect. The second step is to execute, in the working directory, the command:  % wsgen -keep -cp . ch02.ts.TimeServerImpl  The revised SEI and the corresponding SIB must be recompiled before the wsgen utility is used so that the document-style version is current. The wsgen utility then generates four source and four compiled files in the subdirectory ch02 ts jaxws. These files pro- vide the data types needed, in the document-style service, to produce the WSDL auto- matically. For example, among the files are source and compiled versions of the classes GetTimeAsElapsed, which is a request type, and GetTimeAsElapsedResponse, which is a response type. As expected, these two types support requests to and responses from the service operation getTimeAsElapsed. The wsgen utility generates comparable types for the getTimeAsString operation as well. The wsgen utility will be examined again later in this chapter. The revised program can be published as before with the TimeServerPublisher, and the WSDL then is available at the published URL http:  localhost:9876 ts?wsdl. The con- trasting WSDLs now can be used to explain in detail how the document and rpc styles differ. There is one other important change to the TimeServer, which is reflected in the WSDL: the package name changes from ch01.ts to ch02.ts, a change that is reflected in a namespace throughout the WSDL.  Key Features of Document-Style Services The  document  style  indicates  that  a  SOAP-based  web  service’s  underlying  messages contain full XML documents; for instance, a company’s product list as an XML docu- ment or a customer’s order for some products from this list as another XML document. By contrast, the rpc style indicates that the underlying SOAP messages contain param- eters in the request messages and return values in the response messages. Following is a segment of the rpc-style WSDL for the original TimeServer service:  WSDL Structure  39  Download at Boykma.Com                               The types section is empty because the service uses, as return values, only the simple types  xsd:string and  xsd:long. The simple types do not require a definition in the WSDL’s  types  section.  Further,  the  message  names  show  their  relationships  to the corresponding Java @WebMethods; in this case, the method getTimeAsString and the method getTimeAsElapsed. The response messages have a part subelement that gives the data type of the returned value, but because the request messages expect no argu- ments, the request messages do not need part subelements to describe parameters. By  contrast,  here  is  the  same  WSDL  segment  for  the  document-style  version  of  the TimeServer service:            <xsd:import schemaLocation="http:  localhost:9876 ts?xsd=1"          namespace="http:  ts.ch02 ">                                                        The types now contains an import directive for the associated XSD document. The URL for the XSD is http:  localhost:9876 ts?xsd=1. Example 2-6 is the XSD associated with the WSDL.  Example 2-6. The XSD for the TimeServer WSDL    <xs:schema xmlns:tns="http:  ts.ch02 "            xmlns:xs="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"            targetNamespace="http:  ts.ch02 " version="1.0">   <xs:element name="getTimeAsElapsed"               type="tns:getTimeAsElapsed">      40  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com     <xs:element name="getTimeAsElapsedResponse"               type="tns:getTimeAsElapsedResponse">       <xs:element name="getTimeAsString"               type="tns:getTimeAsString">       <xs:element name="getTimeAsStringResponse"               type="tns:getTimeAsStringResponse">                          <xs:element name="return"                   type="xs:string" minOccurs="0">                                                        The XSD document defines four complex types whose names  for instance, the class getTimeAsElapsedResponse  are the names of corresponding messages in the message section. Under the rpc-style, the messages carry the names of the @WebMethods; under the document-style, there is an added level of complexity in that the messages carry the names of XSD types defined in the WSDL’s types section. The request response pattern in a web service is possible under either the document or the rpc style, although the style named rpc obviously underscores this pattern. Under the rpc style, the messages are named but not explicitly typed; under the document style, the messages are explicitly typed in an XSD document. The document style deserves to be the default. This style can support services with rich, explicitly defined data types because the service’s WSDL can define the required types in an XSD document. Further, the document style can support any service pattern, in- cluding request response. Indeed, the SOAP messages exchanged in the TimeServer application look the same regardless of whether the style is rpc or document. From an architectural perspective, the document style is the simpler of the two in that the body of a SOAP message is a self-contained, precisely defined document. The rpc style re- quires messages with the names of the associated operations  in Java, the @WebMethods  with parameters as subelements. From a developer perspective, however, the rpc style is the simpler of the two because the wsgen utility is not needed to generate Java types that  correspond  to  XML  Schema  types.   The  current  Metro  release  generates  the wsgen artifacts automatically. The details follow shortly.  Finally, the use attribute determines how the service’s data types are to be encoded and decoded.  The  WSDL  service  contract  has  to  specify  how  data  types  used  in  the  WSDL Structure  41  Download at Boykma.Com   implementation language  for instance, Java  are serialized to WSDL-compliant types  by default, XML Schema types . On the client side, the WSDL-compliant types then must be deserialized into client-language types  for instance, C or Ruby types . The setting:  means that the service’s type definitions literally follow the WSDL document’s XML Schema. By contrast, the setting:  use = 'literal'  use = 'encoded'  means that the service’s type definitions come from encoding rules, typically the en- coding rules in the SOAP 1.1 specification. As noted earlier, the document encoded and rpc encoded  combinations  are  not  WS-I  compliant.  The  real  choices  are,  therefore, document literal and rpc literal.  Validating a SOAP Message Against a WSDL’s XML Schema One more point about rpc-style versus document-style bindings needs to be made. On the receiving end, a document-style SOAP message can be validated straightforwardly against the associated XML Schema. In rpc-style, by contrast, the validation is trickier precisely  because  there  is  no  associated  XML  Schema.  Example  2-7  is  a  short  Java program that validates an arbitrary XML document against an arbitrary XSD document.  Example 2-7. A short program to validate an XML document  import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource; import javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory; import javax.xml.validation.Schema; import javax.xml.XMLConstants; import javax.xml.validation.Validator;  class ValidateXML {     public static void main String[ ] args  {        if  args.length != 2  {           String msg = "\nUsage: java ValidateXML XMLfile XSDfile";           System.err.println msg ;           return;        }        try {              Read and validate the XML Schema  XSD document .           final String schema_uri = XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI;           SchemaFactory factory = SchemaFactory.newInstance schema_uri ;           Schema schema = factory.newSchema new StreamSource args[1]  ;              Validate the XML document against the XML Schema.           Validator val = schema.newValidator  ;           val.validate new StreamSource args[0]  ;        }           Return on any validation error.        catch Exception e  {           System.err.println e ;  42  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com             return;        }        System.out.println args[0] + " validated against " + args[1] ;     } }  Here is the extracted body of a SOAP response to the document-style TimeServer service:        1208229395922        The  body  has  been  edited  slightly  by  the  addition  of  the  namespace  declaration xmlns:ns1="http:  ts.ch02 , which sets ns1 as an alias or proxy for the namespace URI http:  ts.ch02 .  This  URI  does  occur  in  the  SOAP  message  but  in  the  element SOAP::Envelope rather than in the ns1:getTimeAsElapsedResponse subelement. For a re- view of the full XSD, see Example 2-6. To keep the processing simple, the response body and the XSD are in the local files body.xml and ts.xsd, respectively. The command:  % java ValidateXML body.xml ts.xsd  validates the response’s body against the XSD. If the return element in the body were changed to, say, foo bar, the attempted validation would produce the error message:  'foo bar' is not a valid value for 'integer'  thereby indicating that the SOAP message did not conform to the associated WSDL’s XSD document.  The Wrapped and Unwrapped Document Styles The document style is the default under the WS-I Basic profile for web services intero- perability   see  http:  www.ws-i.org Profiles BasicProfile-1.1.html .  This  default  style provides, through the XSD in the WSDL’s types section, an explicit and precise defi- nition of the data types in the service’s underlying SOAP messages. The document style thereby promotes web service interoperability because a service client can determine precisely which data types are involved in the service and how the document contained in the body of an underlying SOAP message should be structured. However, the rpc style still has appeal in that the web service’s operations have names linked directly to the underlying implementations; for example, to Java @WebMethods. For instance, the TimeServer service in the rpc style has a @WebMethod with the name getTimeAsString whose WSDL counterparts are the request message named getTimeAsString and the response  message  named  getTimeAsStringResponse.  The  rpc  style  is  programmer- friendly. The gist of the wrapped convention, which is unofficial but widely followed, is to give a document-style service the look and feel of an rpc-style service. The wrapped conven- tion seeks to combine the benefits of document and rpc styles.  WSDL Structure  43  Download at Boykma.Com   To begin, Example 2-8 is an example of an unwrapped SOAP envelope, and Exam- ple 2-9 is an example of a wrapped SOAP envelope.  Example 2-8. Unwrapped document style      <soapenv:Envelope     xmlns:soapenv="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "     xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema">           27        94         Example 2-9. Wrapped document style      <soapenv:Envelope     xmlns:soapenv="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "     xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema">                    27          94                The body of the unwrapped SOAP request envelope has two elements, named num1 and num2. These are numbers to be added. The SOAP body does not contain the name of the service operation that is to perform the addition and send the sum as a response. By contrast, the body of a wrapped SOAP request envelope has a single element named addNums, the name of the requested service operation, and two subelements, each hold- ing a number to be added. The wrapped version makes the service operation explicit. The  arguments  for  the  operation  are  nested  in  an  intuitive  manner;  that  is,  as subelements within the operation element addNums. Guidelines for the wrapped document convention are straightforward. Here is a sum- mary of the guidelines:    The SOAP envelope’s body should have only one part, that is, it should contain a single XML element with however many XML subelements are required. For ex- ample, even if a service operation expects arguments and returns a value, the pa- rameters and return value do not occur as standalone XML elements in the SOAP body  but,  rather,  as  XML  subelements  within  the  main  element.  Example  2-9 illustrates with the addNums element as the single XML element in the SOAP body and the pair num1 and num2 as XML subelements.  44  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com     The relationship between the WSDL’s XSD and the single XML element in the SOAP body is well defined. The document-style version of the TimeServer can be used to illustrate. In the XSD, there are four XSD complexType elements, each of which  defines  a  data  type.  For  example,  there  is  a  complexType  with  the  name getTimeAsString and another with the name getTimeAsStringResponse. These def- initions occur in roughly the bottom half of the XSD. In the top half are XML element  definitions,  each  of  which  has  a  name  and  a  type  attribute.  The complexTypes also have names, which are coordinated with the element names. For example, the complexType named getTimeAsString is matched with an element of the same name. Here is a segment of the XSD that shows the name coordination:  <xs:element name="getTimeAsString"             type="tns:getTimeAsString">   <xs:element name="getTimeAsStringResponse"             type="tns:getTimeAsStringResponse">   ...                  <xs:element name="return"                   type="xs:string" minOccurs="0">                  Further, each complexType is either empty  for instance, getTimeAsString  or con- tains  an  xs:sequence   for  instance,  getTimeAsStringResponse,  which  has  an xs:sequence of one XML element . The xs:sequence contains typed arguments and typed returned values. The TimeServer example is quite simple in that the requests contain no arguments and the responses contain just one return value. Nonethe- less, this segment of XSD shows the structure for the general case. For instance, if the getTimeAsStringResponse had several return values, then each would occur as an XML subelement within the xs:sequence. Finally, note that every XML element in this XSD segment  and, indeed, in the full XSD  is named and typed.    The XML elements in the XSD serve as the wrappers for the SOAP message body.  For the ch01.ts.TimeServer, a sample wrapped document is:    <soapenv:Envelope      xmlns:soapenv="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.or g soap envelope "      xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema">                  1205030105192                         WSDL Structure  45  Download at Boykma.Com   This is the same kind of SOAP body generated for an rpc-style service, which is precisely the point. The difference, again, is that the wrapped document-style serv- ice, unlike its rpc-style counterpart, includes explicit type and format information in an XSD from the WSDL’s types section.    The request wrapper has the same name as the service operation  for instance, addNums in Example 2-9 , and the response wrapper should be the request wrapper’s name with Response appended  for instance, addNumsResponse .    The WSDL portType section now has named operations  e.g., getTimeAsString  whose  messages  are  typed.  For  input   request   message getTimeAsString has the type tns:getTimeAsString, which is defined as one of the four complexTypes in the WSDL’s XSD. For the document-style version of the serv- ice, here is the portType segment:  instance,  the                                                      The wrapped document convention, despite its unofficial status, has become prevalent. JWS supports the convention. By default, a Java SOAP-based web service is wrapped doc lit, that is, wrapped document style with literal encoding. This excursion into the details of WSDL binding section will be helpful in the next example, which uses the wsimport utility to generate client-support code against Am- azon’s E-Commerce web service. The contrast between wrapped and unwrapped is helpful in understanding the client-support code.  Amazon’s E-Commerce Web Service The section title has the popular and formerly official name for one of the web services that  Amazon  hosts.  The  official  name  is  now  Amazon  Associates  Web  Service.  The service in question is accessible as SOAP-based or REST-style. The service is free of charge, but it does require registration at http:  affiliate-program.amazon.com gp asso ciates join. For the examples in this section, an Amazon access key  as opposed to the secret access key used to generate an authentication token  is required. Amazon’s  E-Commerce  service  replicates  the  interactive  experience  at  the  Amazon website   http:  www.amazon.com .  For  example,  the  service  supports  searching  for items, bidding on items and putting items up for bid, creating a shopping cart and filling it with items, and so on. The two sample clients illustrate item search.  46  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com   This section examines two Java clients against the Amazon E-Commerce service. Each client is generated with Java support code from the wsimport utility introduced earlier. The difference between the two clients refines the distinction between the wrapped and unwrapped conventions.  An E-Commerce Client in Wrapped Style The Java support code for the client can be generated with the command:  % wsimport -keep -p awsClient \ http:  ecs.amazonaws.com AWSECommerceService AWSECommerceService.wsdl      Recall that the -p awsClient part of the command generates a package  and, therefore, a subdirectory  named awsClient. The  source  code  for  the  first  Amazon  client,  AmazonClientW,  resides  in  the  working directory; that is, the parent directory of awsClient. Example 2-10 is the application code, which searches for books about quantum gravity.  Example 2-10. An E-Commerce Java client in wrapped style  import awsClient.AWSECommerceService; import awsClient.AWSECommerceServicePortType; import awsClient.ItemSearchRequest; import awsClient.ItemSearch; import awsClient.Items; import awsClient.Item; import awsClient.OperationRequest; import awsClient.SearchResultsMap; import javax.xml.ws.Holder; import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList;  class AmazonClientW {    W is for Wrapped style     public static void main String[ ] args  {       if  args.length < 1  {         System.err.println "Usage: java AmazonClientW  " ;         return;       }       final String access_key = args[0];           Construct a service object to get the port object.       AWSECommerceService service = new AWSECommerceService  ;       AWSECommerceServicePortType port = service.getAWSECommerceServicePort  ;           Construct an empty request object and then add details.       ItemSearchRequest request = new ItemSearchRequest  ;       request.setSearchIndex "Books" ;       request.setKeywords "quantum gravity" ;        ItemSearch search = new ItemSearch  ;       search.getRequest  .add request ;       search.setAWSAccessKeyId access_key ;  Amazon’s E-Commerce Web Service  47  Download at Boykma.Com         Holder  operation_request = null;       Holder > items = new Holder >  ;        port.itemSearch search.getMarketplaceDomain  ,                       search.getAWSAccessKeyId  ,                       search.getSubscriptionId  ,                       search.getAssociateTag  ,                       search.getXMLEscaping  ,                       search.getValidate  ,                       search.getShared  ,                       search.getRequest  ,                       operation_request,                       items ;           Unpack the response to print the book titles.       Items retval = items.value.get 0 ;          first and only Items element       List  item_list = retval.getItem  ;    list of Item subelements       for  Item item : item_list                  each Item in the list         System.out.println item.getItemAttributes  .getTitle   ;     } }    The code is compiled and executed in the usual way but requires your access key  a string such as 1A67QRNF7AGRQ1XXMJ07  as a command-line argument. On a sam- ple run, the output for an item search among books on the string quantum gravity was:  The Trouble With Physics The Final Theory: Rethinking Our Scientific Legacy Three Roads to Quantum Gravity Keeping It Real  Quantum Gravity, Book 1  Selling Out  Quantum Gravity, Book 2  Mr Tompkins in Paperback Head First Physics Introduction to Quantum Effects in Gravity The Large, the Small and the Human Mind Feynman Lectures on Gravitation        The AmazonClientW client is not intuitive. Indeed, the code uses relatively obscure types such as Holder. The itemSearch method, which does the actual search, takes 10 argu- ments, the last of which, named items in this example, holds the service response. This response needs to be unpacked in order to get a list of the book titles returned from the search. The next client is far simpler. Before looking at the simpler client, however, it will be instructive to consider what makes the first client so tricky. In the binding section of the WSDL for the E-Commerce service, the style is set to the default, document, and the encoding is likewise set to the default, literal. Further, the wrapped convention is in play, as this segment from the XSD illustrates:                    <xs:element name="MarketplaceDomain"                   type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" >  48  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com         <xs:element name="AWSAccessKeyId"                   type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" >       <xs:element name="SubscriptionId"                   type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" >       <xs:element name="AssociateTag"                   type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" >       <xs:element name="XMLEscaping"                   type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" >       <xs:element name="Validate"                   type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" >       <xs:element name="Shared"                   type="tns:ItemSearchRequest" minOccurs="0" >       <xs:element name="Request"                   type="tns:ItemSearchRequest" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" >                  This XSD segment defines the ItemSearch element, which is the wrapper type in the body of a SOAP request. Here is a segment from the XSD’s message section, which shows that the request message is the type defined above:                  For the service response to an ItemSearch, the wrapper type defined in the XSD is:                                                 The impact of these WSDL definitions is evident in the SOAP request message from a client and the SOAP response message from the server. Example 2-11 shows a SOAP request from a sample run.  Example 2-11. A SOAP request against Amazon’s E-Commerce service    <soapenv:Envelope   xmlns:soapenv="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "   xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"   xmlns:ns1="http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-03-03">                     ...                      quantum gravity             Books                   Amazon’s E-Commerce Web Service  49  Download at Boykma.Com            The ItemSearch wrapper is the single XML element in the SOAP body and this element has two subelements, one with the name ns1:AWSAccessKeyId and the other with the name ns1:Request, whose subelements specify the search string  in this case, quantum gravity  and the search category  in this case, Books . Here is part of the SOAP response for the request above:    <SOAP-ENV:Envelope     xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "     xmlns:SOAP-ENC="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap encoding "     xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"     xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema">         <ItemSearchResponse        xmlns="http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-03-03">                                                   0040N1YEKV0CRCT2B5PR                                            0.0566580295562744                                       True                           quantum gravity               Books                                 207           21                       061891868X             http:  www.amazon.com gp redirect.html...

This element contains various subelements, the most interesting of which is named Items. The Items subelement contains multiple Item subelements, one apiece for a book on quantum gravity. Only one Item is shown, but this is enough to see the structure of the response document. The code near the end of the AmazonClientW reflects the structure of the SOAP response: first the Items element is extracted, then a list of Item subelements, each of which contains a book’s title as an XML attribute. Now we can look at a wsimport-generated artifact for the E-Commerce service, in par- ticular at the annotations on the itemSearch method with its 10 arguments. The method is  declared  in  the  AWSECommerceServicePortType  interface,  which  declares  a  single @WebMethod for each of the E-Commerce service’s operations. Example 2-12 shows the declaration of interest.  Example 2-12. Java code generated from Amazon’s E-Commerce WSDL  @WebMethod operationName = "ItemSearch",            action = "http:  soap.amazon.com"  @RequestWrapper localName = "ItemSearch",                 targetNamespace =                  "http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-03-03",                 className = "awsClient.ItemSearch"  @ResponseWrapper localName = "ItemSearchResponse",                  targetNamespace =                   "http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-03-03",                  className = "awsClient.ItemSearchResponse"  public void itemSearch    @WebParam name = "MarketplaceDomain",             targetNamespace =              "http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-03-03"    String marketplaceDomain,   @WebParam name = "AWSAccessKeyId",             targetNamespace =              "http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-03-03"    String awsAccessKeyId,   ...   ItemSearchRequest shared,   @WebParam name = "Request",             targetNamespace =              "http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-03-03"    List  request,   @WebParam name = "OperationRequest",             targetNamespace =              "http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-03-03",             mode = WebParam.Mode.OUT    Holder  operationRequest,   @WebParam name = "Items",             targetNamespace =              "http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-03-03",             mode = WebParam.Mode.OUT    Holder > items ;  Amazon’s E-Commerce Web Service  51  Download at Boykma.Com   The  last  two  parameters,  named  operationRequest  and  items,  are  described  as WebParam.Mode.OUT to signal that they represent return values from the E-Commerce service  to  the  requester.  An  OUT  parameter  is  returned  in  a  Java  Holder  object.  The method itemSearch thus reflects the XSD request and response types from the WSDL. The XSD type ItemSearch, which is the request wrapper, has eight subelements such as  MarketplaceDomain,  AWSAccessKeyId,  and  ItemSearchRequest.  Each  of  these subelements  occurs  as  a  parameter  in  the  itemSearch  method.  The  XSD  type ItemSearchResponse has two subelements, named OperationRequest and Items, which are the last two parameters  the OUT parameters  in the itemSearch method. The tricky part for the programmer, of course, is that itemSearch becomes hard to invoke precisely because of the 10 arguments, especially because the last 2 arguments hold the return values. Why does the wrapped style result in such a complicated client? Recall that the wrapped style is meant to give a document-style service the look and feel of an rpc-style service without giving up the advantages of document style. The wrapped document style requires a wrapper XML element, typically with the name of a web service operation such as ItemSearch, that has a typed XML subelement per operation parameter. In the case of the itemSearch operation in the E-Commerce service, there are eight in or request pa- rameters and two  out or response parameters, including the critical  Items response parameter.  The  XML  subelements  that  represent  the  parameters  occur  in  an xs:sequence, which means that each parameter is positional. For example, the response parameter  Items  must  come  last  in  the  list  of  10  parameters  because  the  part @ResponseWrapper comes after the @RequestWrapper and the Items parameter comes last in the @ResponseWrapper. The upshot is that the wrapped style makes for a very tricky invocation of the itemSearch method. The wrapped style, without a workaround, may well produce an irritated programmer. The next section presents a workaround.  An E-Commerce Client in Unwrapped Style The client built from artifacts in the unwrapped style is simpler than the client built from artifacts in the wrapped style. However, artifacts for the simplified E-Commerce client are generated from the very same WSDL as the artifacts for the more complicated, wrapped-style client. The underlying SOAP messages have the same structure with either the complicated or the simplified client. Yet the clients differ significantly—the simplified  client  is  far  easier  to  code  and  to  understand.  Here  is  the  call  to invokeSearch in the simplified client:  ItemSearchResponse response = port.itemSearch item_search ;  The itemSearch method now takes one argument and returns a value, which is assigned to the object reference response. Unlike the complicated client, the simplified client has no Holder of a return value, which is an exotic and difficult construct. The invocation of itemSearch is familiar, identical in style to method calls in standalone applications. The full simplified client is in Example 2-13.  52  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com   Example 2-13. An E-Commerce Java client in unwrapped style  import awsClient2.AWSECommerceService; import awsClient2.AWSECommerceServicePortType; import awsClient2.ItemSearchRequest; import awsClient2.ItemSearchResponse; import awsClient2.ItemSearch; import awsClient2.Items; import awsClient2.Item; import java.util.List;  class AmazonClientU {    U is for Unwrapped style     public static void main String[ ] args  {            Usage         if  args.length != 1  {             System.err.println "Usage: java AmazonClientW <access key<" ;             return;         }         final String access_key = args[0];             Create service and get portType reference.         AWSECommerceService service = new AWSECommerceService  ;         AWSECommerceServicePortType port =           service.getAWSECommerceServicePort  ;             Create request.         ItemSearchRequest request = new ItemSearchRequest  ;             Add details to request.         request.setSearchIndex "Books" ;         request.setKeywords "quantum gravity" ;         ItemSearch item_search= new ItemSearch  ;         item_search.setAWSAccessKeyId access_key ;         item_search.getRequest  .add request ;             Invoke service operation and get response.         ItemSearchResponse response = port.itemSearch item_search ;          List  item_list = response.getItems  ;         for  Items next : item_list             for  Item item : next.getItem                  System.out.println item.getItemAttributes  .getTitle   ;     } }  Generating the simplified client with the wsimport is ironically more complicated than generating the complicated client. Here is the command, on three lines to enhance readability:  % wsimport -keep -p awsClient2 \   http:  ecs.amazonaws.com AWSECommerceService AWSECommerceService.wsdl \   -b custom.xml .   Amazon’s E-Commerce Web Service  53  Download at Boykma.Com   The -b flag at the end specifies a customized jaxws:bindings document, in this case in the file custom.xml, that overrides wsimport defaults, in this case a WrapperStyle setting of true. Example 2-14 shows the document with the customized binding information.  Example 2-14. A customized bindings document for wsimport  <jaxws:bindings     wsdlLocation =      "http:  ecs.amazonaws.com AWSECommerceService AWSECommerceService.wsdl"     xmlns:jaxws="http:  java.sun.com xml ns jaxws">    false             The impact of the customized binding document is evident in the generated artifacts. For example, the segment of the AWSECommerceServicePortType artifact becomes:  @SOAPBinding parameterStyle = SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle.BARE  public interface AWSECommerceServicePortType { ...   @WebMethod operationName = "ItemSearch",              action = "http:  soap.amazon.com"    @WebResult name = "ItemSearchResponse",              targetNamespace =               "http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-04-07",              partName = "body"    public ItemSearchResponse itemSearch        @WebParam name = "ItemSearch",                 targetNamespace =                  "http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2008-04-07",                 partName = "body"        ItemSearch body ;  The wsimport-generated interface AWSECommerceServicePortType now has the annota- tion @SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle.BARE, where BARE is the alternative to WRAPPED. JWS names the attribute parameterStyle because the contrast between wrapped and un- wrapped in document-style web services comes down to how parameters are represented in the SOAP body. In the unwrapped style, the parameters occur bare; that is, as a sequence of unwrapped XML subelements in the SOAP body. In the wrapped style, the parameters occur as wrapped XML subelements of an XML element with the name of the service operation; and the wrapper XML element is the only direct subelement of the SOAP body. What may be surprising is that the structure of the underlying SOAP messages, both the request and the response, remain unchanged. For instance, the request message from the simplified client AmazonClientU is identical in structure to the request message from the complicated client AmazonClientW. Here is the body of the SOAP envelope from a request that the simplified client generates:             ...         54  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com          quantum gravity         Books                   The SOAP body contains a single wrapper element, ns1:ItemSearch, with subelements for the access key identifier and the request details. The complicated, wrapped-style client generates requests with the identical structure. The key difference is in the Java client code, of course. The simplified client, with the unwrapped parameterStyle, calls invokeSearch with one argument of type ItemSearch and expects a single response of type ItemSearchResponse. So the parameterStyle with a value of BARE eliminates the complicated call to invokeSearch with 10 arguments, 8 of which are arguments bound to the subelements in the @RequestWrapper, and 2 of which are arguments bound to subelements in the @ResponseWrapper. The E-Commerce example shows that the wrapped document-style, despite its advan- tages, can complicate the programming of a client. In that example, the simplified client with the BARE or unwrapped parameterStyle is a workaround. The underlying WSDL for the E-Commerce example could be simplified, which would make clients against the service easier to code. Among SOAP-based web services avail- able commercially, it is not unusual to find complicated WSDLs that in turn complicate the clients written against the service.  Tradeoffs Between the RPC and Document Styles JWS still supports both rpc and document styles, with document as the default; for both styles, only literal encoding is supported in compliance with the WS-I Basic Profile. The issue of rpc versus document often is touted as a freedom of choice issue. Nonetheless, it is clear that document style, especially in the wrapped flavor, is rapidly gaining mind share. This subsection briefly reviews some tradeoffs between the two styles. As in any tradeoff scenario, the pros and cons need to be read with a critical eye, es- pecially because a particular point may be cited as both a pro and a con. One familiar complaint against the rpc style is that it imposes the request response pattern on the service. However, this pattern remains the dominant one in real-world, SOAP-based web services, and there are obviously situations  for instance, validating a credit card to be used in a purchase  in which the request response pattern is needed. Here are some upsides of the rpc style:    The automatically generated WSDL is relatively short and simple because there is  no types section.    Messages in the WSDL carry the names of the underlying web service operations, which are @WebMethods in a Java-based service. The WSDL thus has a what you see is what you get style with respect to the service’s operations.  Amazon’s E-Commerce Web Service  55  Download at Boykma.Com     Message throughput may improve because the messages do not carry any type-  encoding information.  Here are some downsides to the rpc style:    The WSDL, with its empty types section, does not provide an XSD against which  the body of a SOAP message can be validated.    The service cannot use arbitrarily rich data types because there is no XSD to define such types. The service is thus restricted to relatively simple types such as integers, strings, dates, and arrays of such.    This style, with its obvious link to the request response pattern, encourages tight coupling  between  the  service  and  the  client.  For  example,  the  Java  client ch01.ts.TimeClient blocks on the call:  port.getTimeAsString    until either the service responds or an exception is thrown. This same point is sometimes  made  by  noting  that  the  rpc  style  has  an  inherently  synchronous  as opposed to asynchronous invocation idiom. The next section offers a workaround, which shows how JWS supports nonblocking clients under the request response pattern.    Java services written in this style may not be consumable in other frameworks, thus undermining interoperability. Further, long-term support within the web services community and from the WS-I group is doubtful.  Here are some upsides of the document style:    The body of a SOAP message can be validated against the XSD in the types section  of the WSDL.    A service in this style can use arbitrarily rich data types, as the XML Schema lan- guage supports not only simple types such as integers, strings, and dates, but also arbitrarily rich complex types.    There is great flexibility in how the body of a SOAP message is structured so long  as the structure is clearly defined in an XSD.    The wrapped convention provides a way to enjoy a key upside of the rpc style— naming the body of a SOAP message after the corresponding service operation— without enduring the downsides of the rpc style.  Here are some downsides of the document style:    In the unwrapped variant, the SOAP message does not carry the name of the service operation, which can complicate the dispatching of messages to the appropriate program code.    The  wrapped  variant  adds  a  level  of  complexity,  in  particular  at  the  API  level. Writing  a  client  against  a  wrapped-document  service  can  be  challenging,  as  the AmazonClientW example shows.  56  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com     The wrapped variant does not support overloaded service operations because the XML wrapper  element in the body of a SOAP message must have the name of the service operation. In effect, then, there can be only one operation for a given element name.  An Asynchronous E-Commerce Client As noted earlier, the original TimeClient blocks on calls against the TimeServer service operations. For example, the call:  port.getTimeAsString    blocks until either a response from the web service occurs or an exception is thrown. The call to getTimeAsString is, therefore, known as a blocking or synchronous call. JWS also supports nonblocking or asynchronous clients against web services. Example 2-15 shows a client that makes an asynchronous call against the E-Commerce service.  Example 2-15. An asynchronous client against the E-Commerce service  import javax.xml.ws.AsyncHandler; import javax.xml.ws.Response;  import awsClient3.AWSECommerceService; import awsClient3.AWSECommerceServicePortType; import awsClient3.ItemSearchRequest; import awsClient3.ItemSearchResponse; import awsClient3.ItemSearch; import awsClient3.Items; import awsClient3.Item;  import java.util.List; import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;  class AmazonAsyncClient {     public static void main String[ ] args  {            Usage         if  args.length != 1  {             System.err.println "Usage: java AmazonAsyncClient  " ;             return;         }         final String access_key = args[0];             Create service and get portType reference.         AWSECommerceService service = new AWSECommerceService  ;         AWSECommerceServicePortType port = service.getAWSECommerceServicePort  ;             Create request.         ItemSearchRequest request = new ItemSearchRequest  ;             Add details to request.         request.setSearchIndex "Books" ;  Amazon’s E-Commerce Web Service  57  Download at Boykma.Com           request.setKeywords "quantum gravity" ;         ItemSearch item_search= new ItemSearch  ;         item_search.setAWSAccessKeyId access_key ;         item_search.getRequest  .add request ;          port.itemSearchAsync item_search, new MyHandler   ;             In this case, just sleep to give the search process time.            In a production application, other useful tasks could be            performed and the application could run indefinitely.         try {            Thread.sleep 400 ;         }         catch InterruptedException e  { System.err.println e ; }     }         The handler class implements handleResponse, which executes        if and when there's a response.     static class MyHandler implements AsyncHandler  {         public void handleResponse Response  future  {           try {              ItemSearchResponse response = future.get  ;              List  item_list = response.getItems  ;              for  Items next : item_list                 for  Item item : next.getItem                      System.out.println item.getItemAttributes  .getTitle   ;           }           catch InterruptedException e  { System.err.println e ; }           catch ExecutionException e  { System.err.println e ; }         }     } }    The nonblocking E-Commerce client uses artifacts generated by wsimport, again with a customized bindings file. Here is the file:  <jaxws:bindings     wsdlLocation=       "http:  ecs.amazonaws.com AWSECommerceService AWSECommerceService.wsdl"     xmlns:jaxws="http:  java.sun.com xml ns jaxws">    false     true     with the enableAsyncMapping attribute set to true. The nonblocking call can follow different styles. In the style shown here, the call to itemSearchAsync takes two arguments: the first is an ItemSearchRequest, and the second is a class that implements the AsyncHandler interface, which declares a single method named handleResponse. The call is:  port.itemSearchAsync item_search, new MyHandler   ;        58  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com   If and when an ItemSearchResponse comes from the E-Commerce service, the method handleResponse in the MyHandler class executes as a separate thread and prints out the books’ titles. There is a version of itemSearchAsync that takes one argument, an ItemSearchRequest. In this version the call also returns if and when the E-Commerce service sends a re- sponse, which then can be processed as in the other E-Commerce clients. In this style, the application might start a separate thread to execute this code segment:  Response  res = port.itemSearchAsync item_search ; try {    ItemSearchResponse response = res.get  ;    List  item_list = response.getItems  ;    for  Items next : item_list        for  Item item : next.getItem             System.out.println item.getItemAttributes  .getTitle   ; } catch InterruptedException e  { System.err.println e ; } catch ExecutionException e  { System.err.println e ; }        JWS is flexible in supporting nonblocking as well as the default blocking clients. In the end, it is application logic that determines which type of client is suitable.  The wsgen Utility and JAX-B Artifacts Any document-style service, wrapped or unwrapped, requires the kind of artifacts that the wsgen utility produces. It is time to look again at this utility. A simple experiment underscores the role that the utility plays. To begin, the line:  @SOAPBinding style = Style.RPC   should  be  commented  out  or  deleted  from  the  SEI  ch01.ts.TimeServer.  With  this annotation gone, the web service becomes document style rather than rpc style. After recompiling the altered SEI, try to publish the service with the command:  % java ch01.ts.TimeServerPublisher  The resulting error message is:  Exception in thread "main" com.sun.xml.internal.ws.model.RuntimeModelerException: runtime modeler error: Wrapper class ch01.ts.jaxws.GetTimeAsString is not found.       The message is obscure in citing the immediate problem rather than the underlying cause.  The  immediate  problem  is  that  the  publisher  cannot  find  the  class ch01.ts.jaxws.GetTimeAsString. Indeed, at this point the package ch01.ts.jaxws that houses the class does not even exist. The publisher cannot generate the WSDL because the publisher needs Java classes such as GetTimeAsString to do so. The wsgen utility produces the classes required to build the WSDL, classes known as wsgen artifacts. The command:  % wsgen -keep -cp . ch01.ts.TimeServerImpl  The wsgen Utility and JAX-B Artifacts   59  Download at Boykma.Com   produces the artifacts and, if necessary, the package ch01.ts.jaxws that houses these artifacts. In the TimeServer example, there are four messages altogether: the request and response messages for the getTimeAsString operation, and the request and response messages for the getTimeAsElapsed operation. The wsgen utility generates a Java class— hence, a Java data type—for each of these messages. It is these Java types that the publisher uses to generate the WSDL for a document-style service. So each of the Java data types is bound to an XML Schema type, which serves as a type for one of the four messages involved in the service. Considered from the other direction, a document-style web service has typed messages. The wsgen artifacts are the Java types from which the XML Schema types for the messages are derived. A SOAP-based web service, in either document or rpc style, should be interoperable: a client application written in one language should be able to interact seamlessly with a service written in another despite any differences in data types between the two lan- guages. A shared type system such as XML Schema is, therefore, the key to interoper- ability. The document style extends typing to the service messages; and typed messages requires the explicit binding of Java and XML Schema types. Any document-style service, wrapped or unwrapped, has a WSDL with an XSD in its types section.  The term in is being used loosely here. The types section could import the XSD or link to the XSD.  The types in the WSDL’s associated XSD bind to types in a service-implementation or client language such as Java. The wsgen utility, introduced earlier to change the TimeServer service from rpc to document style, generates Java types that  bind  to  XML  Schema  types.  Under  the  hood,  this  utility  uses  the  packages associated with JAX-B  Java API for XML-Binding . In a nutshell, JAX-B supports con- versions between Java and XML types.  A JAX-B Example Before looking again at the artifacts that wsgen generates, let’s consider a JAX-B ex- ample to get a better sense of what is going on in wsgen. Example 2-16 is the code for a programmer-defined Java type, the Person class, and Example 2-17 is another pro- grammer-defined Java type, the Skier class. Each class declaration begins with a single annotation for Java-to-XML binding. The  Person class is annotated as an  @XmlType, whereas  the  Skier  class  is  annotated  as  an  @XmlRootElement.  At  the  design  level,  a Skier is also a Person; hence, the Skier class has a Person field.  Example 2-16. The Person class for a JAX-B example  import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlType;  @XmlType public class Person  {        fields     private String name;     private int    age;     private String gender;  60  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com          constructors     public Person   { }      public Person String name, int age, String gender {         setName name ;         setAge age ;         setGender gender ;     }         properties: name, age, gender     public String getName   { return name; }     public void setName String name  { this.name = name; }      public int getAge   { return age;  }     public void setAge int age  { this.age = age; }      public String getGender   { return gender; }     public void setGender String gender  { this.gender = gender; } }      Example 2-17. The Skier class for a JAX-B example  import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement; import java.util.Collection;  @XmlRootElement public class Skier  {        fields     private Person person;     private String national_team;     private Collection major_achievements;        constructors     public Skier   { }     public Skier  Person person,                   String national_team,                   Collection  major_achievements  {         setPerson person ;         setNationalTeam national_team ;         setMajorAchievements major_achievements ;     }        properties     public Person getPerson   { return person; }     public void setPerson  Person person  { this.person = person; }      public String getNationalTeam   { return national_team; }     public void setNationalTeam String national_team  {         this.national_team = national_team;     }      public Collection getMajorAchievements   { return major_achievements; }     public void setMajorAchievements Collection major_achievements  {         this.major_achievements = major_achievements;     } }      The wsgen Utility and JAX-B Artifacts   61  Download at Boykma.Com   The @XmlType and @XmlRootElement annotations direct the marshaling of Skier objects, where  marshaling  is  the  process  of  encoding  an  in-memory  object   for  example,  a Skier  as an XML document so that, for instance, the encoding can be sent across a network to be unmarshaled or decoded at the other end. In common usage, the dis- tinction  between  marshal  and  unmarshal  is  very  close  and  perhaps  identical  to  the serialize deserialize distinction. I use the distinctions interchangeably. JAX-B supports the marshaling of in-memory Java objects to XML documents and the unmarshaling of XML documents to in-memory Java objects. The annotation @XmlType, applied in this example to the Person class, indicates that JAX-B  should  generate  an  XML  Schema  type  from  the  Java  type.  The  annotation @XmlRootElement, applied in this example to the Skier class, indicates that JAX-B should generate an XML document  outermost or root  element from the Java class. Accord- ingly, the resulting XML in this example is a document whose outermost element rep- resents a skier; and the document has a nested element that represents a person. The Marshal application in Example 2-18 illustrates marshaling and unmarshaling.  Example 2-18. The Marshal application for a JAX-B example  import java.io.File; import java.io.OutputStream; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.InputStream; import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.io.IOException; import javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext; import javax.xml.bind.Marshaller; import javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller; import javax.xml.bind.JAXBException; import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList;  class Marshal {     private static final String file_name = "bd.mar";     public static void main String[ ] args  {         new Marshal  .run_example  ;     }      private void run_example   {         try {             JAXBContext ctx = JAXBContext.newInstance Skier.class ;             Marshaller m = ctx.createMarshaller  ;             m.setProperty Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true ;                 Marshal a Skier object: 1st to stdout, 2nd to file             Skier skier = createSkier  ;             m.marshal skier, System.out ;              FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream file_name ;             m.marshal skier, out ;             out.close  ;  62  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com                  Unmarshal as proof of concept             Unmarshaller u = ctx.createUnmarshaller  ;             Skier bd_clone =  Skier  u.unmarshal new File file_name  ;             System.out.println  ;             m.marshal bd_clone, System.out ;         }         catch JAXBException e  { System.err.println e ; }         catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; }     }      private Skier createSkier   {         Person bd = new Person "Bjoern Daehlie", 41, "Male" ;         List  list = new ArrayList   ;         list.add "12 Olympic Medals" ;         list.add "9 World Championships" ;         list.add "Winningest Winter Olympian" ;         list.add "Greatest Nordic Skier" ;         return new Skier bd, "Norway", list ;     } }      The application constructs a Skier object, including a Person object encapsulated as a Skier field, and sets the appropriate Skier and Person properties. A critical feature of marshaling is that the process preserves an object’s state in the encoding, where an object’s state comprises the values of its instance  that is, non-static  fields. In the case of a Skier object, the marshaling must preserve state information such as the skier’s major  accomplishments  together  with  Person-specific  state  information  such  as  the skier’s name and age. The @XmlRootElement annotation in the declaration of the Skier class directs the marshaling as follows: the Skier object is encoded as an XML document whose outermost  that is, document  element is named skier. The @XmlType annotation in the Person class directs the marshaling as follows: the skier XML document has a person subelement, which in turn has subelements for the name, age, and gender prop- erties of the marshaled skier. By default, JAX-B marshaling follows standard Java and JavaBean naming conventions. For example, the Java class Skier becomes the XML tag named skier and the Java class Person becomes the XML tag named person. For both the Skier and the encapsulated Person objects, the JavaBean-style get methods are invoked  e.g., getNationalTeam in Skier and getAge in Person  to populate the XML document with state information about the skier. It is possible to override, with annotations, JavaBean naming conventions in marshaling and unmarshaling classes. Following, for example, is a wsgen-generated artifact with the get and set methods that do not follow JavaBean naming conventions. The anno- tation of interest is in bold:  ... @XmlRootElement name = "getTimeAsElapsedResponse", namespace = "http:  ts.ch02 "  @XmlAccessorType XmlAccessType.FIELD  @XmlType name = "getTimeAsElapsedResponse", namespace = "http:  ts.ch02 "   The wsgen Utility and JAX-B Artifacts   63  Download at Boykma.Com   public class GetTimeAsElapsedResponse {     @XmlElement name = "return", namespace = ""      private long _return;     public long get_return   { return this._return; }      public void set_return long _return  { this._return = _return; } }  The annotation in bold indicates that the field named _return will be marshaled and unmarshaled rather than a property defined with a get set method pair that follows the usual JavaBean naming conventions. Other annotation attributes can be set to override the default naming conventions. For example, if the annotation in the Skier class declaration is changed to:  @XmlRootElement name = "NordicSkier"   then the resulting XML document begins:       Once the Skier object has been constructed, the Marshal application marshals the object to the standard output and, to set up unmarshaling, to a local file. Here is the XML document that results from marshaling the legendary Nordic skier Bjoern Daehlie:          <majorAchievements         xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"         xmlns:xs="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"         xsi:type="xs:string">       12 Olympic Medals           <majorAchievements         xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"         xmlns:xs="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"         xsi:type="xs:string">       9 World Championships           <majorAchievements         xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"         xmlns:xs="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"         xsi:type="xs:string">       Winningest Winter Olympian           <majorAchievements         xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"         xmlns:xs="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"         xsi:type="xs:string">       Greatest Nordic Skier            Norway                 41           Male   64  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com            Bjoern Daehlie               The unmarshaling process constructs a Skier, with its encapsulated Person field, from the XML document. JAX-B unmarshaling requires that each class have a public no- argument constructor, which is used in the construction. After the object is constructed, the appropriate set methods are invoked  for instance, setNationalTeam in Skier and setAge in Person  to restore the marshaled skier’s state. The marshaling and unmarshal- ing processes are remarkably clear and straightforward at the code level.  Marshaling and wsgen Artifacts Now we can tie the wsgen utility and marshaling together. Recall that there were two steps  to  changing  the  TimeServer  application  from  rpc  to  document  style.  First,  the annotation:  @SOAPBinding style = Style.RPC   is commented out in the SEI, ch01.ts.TimeServer. Second, the wsgen utility is executed in the working directory against the ch01.ts.TimeServerImpl class:  % wsgen -keep -cp . ch01.ts.TimeServerImpl  The wsgen invocation generates two source and two compiled files in the automatically created subdirectory ch01 ts jaxws. Example 2-19 shows the wsgen artifact, the class named GetTimeAsElapsedResponse, with the comments removed.  Example 2-19. A Java class generated with wsgen  package ch01.ts.jaxws;  import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessorType; import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement; import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement; import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlType;  @XmlRootElement name = "getTimeAsElapsedResponse", namespace = "http:  ts.ch01 "  @XmlAccessorType XmlAccessType.FIELD  @XmlType name = "getTimeAsElapsedResponse", namespace = "http:  ts.ch01 "  public class GetTimeAsElapsedResponse {     @XmlElement name = "return", namespace = ""      private long _return;     public long get_return   { return this._return; }     public void set_return long _return  { this._return = _return; } }      Of particular interest is the @XmlType annotation applied to the class. The annotation sets  the  name  attribute  to  getTimeAsElapsedResponse,  the  name  of  a  SOAP  message returned from the web service to the client on a call to the getTimeAsElapsed opera- tion. The @XmlType annotation means that such SOAP response messages are typed; that  The wsgen Utility and JAX-B Artifacts   65  Download at Boykma.Com   is, that they satisfy an XML Schema. In a document-style service, a SOAP message is typed. Example  2-20  shows  a  modified  version  of  the  Marshal  application,  renamed MarshalGTER  to  signal  that  the  revised  application  is  to  be  run  against  the  wsgen- generated class named GetTimeAsElapsedResponse.  Example 2-20. Code to illustrate the link between wsgen and JAX-B  import javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext; import javax.xml.bind.Marshaller; import javax.xml.bind.JAXBException;  import ch01.ts.jaxws.GetTimeAsElapsedResponse;  class MarshalGTER {     private static final String file_name = "gter.mar";      public static void main String[ ] args  {         new MarshalGTER  .run_example  ;     }      private void run_example   {         try {             JAXBContext ctx =                 JAXBContext.newInstance GetTimeAsElapsedResponse.class ;             Marshaller m = ctx.createMarshaller  ;             m.setProperty Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true ;              GetTimeAsElapsedResponse tr = new GetTimeAsElapsedResponse  ;             tr.set_return new java.util.Date  .getTime   ;              m.marshal tr, System.out ;         }         catch JAXBException e  { System.err.println e ; }     } }       The marshaled XML document on a sample run was:           1209174518855           For  reference,  here  is  the  response  message  from  the  document-style  version  of  the TimeServer service:    <soapenv:Envelope     xmlns:soapenv="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "     xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"     xmlns:ns1="http:  ts.ch01 ">            66  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com          1209181713849                     There are some incidental differences between the body of the SOAP message and the output of the MarshalGTER application. For instance, the namespace prefix is ns1 in the SOAP message but ns2 in the marshaled XML document. Note, however, that the all- important namespace URI is the same in both: http:  ts.ch01. In the SOAP message, the namespace prefix is defined in the Envelope element rather than in the element getTimeAsElapsedResponse. Of interest here is that the wsgen-generated artifacts such as the GetTimeAsElapsedResponse class provide the annotated types that the underlying SOAP libraries can use to marshal Java objects of some type into XML documents and to unmarshal such documents into Java objects of the appropriate type.  An Overview of Java Types and XML Schema Types Java’s primitive types such as int and byte bind to similarly named XML Schema types, in this case xsd:int and xsd:byte, respectively. The java.lang.String type binds to xsd:string, and the java.util.Calendar typebinds to each of xsd:date, xsd:time, and xsd:dateTime. The XML Schema type xsd:decimal binds to the Java type BigDecimal. Not all bindings are obvious and the same Java type—for example, int may match up with several XSD types, for instance, xsd:int and xsd:unsignedShort. Here is the reason for the apparent mismatch between a Java int and an XSD xsd:unsignedShort. Java technically does not have unsigned integer types.  You could argue, of course, that a Java char is really an unsigned 16-bit integer.  The maximam value of the Java 16-bit short integer is 32,767, but the maximum value of the xsd:unsignedShort integer is 65,535, a value within the range of a 32-bit Java int. What JAX-B brings to the table is a framework for binding arbitrarily rich Java types, with the Skier class as but a hint of the possibilities, to XML types. Instances of these Java types can be marshaled to XML document instances, which in turn can be un- marshaled to instances of either Java types or types in some other language. How the wsgen utility and the JAX-B packages interact in JWS now can be summarized. A Java web service in document rather than rpc style has a nonempty types section in its WSDL. This section defines, in the XML Schema language, the types required for the web service. The wsgen utility generates, from the SIB, Java classes that are coun- terparts of XSD types. These wsgen artifacts are available for the underlying JWS li- braries, in particular for the JAX-B family of packages, to convert  marshal  instances of Java types  that is, Java in-memory objects  into XML instances of XML types  that is, into XML document instances that satisfy an XML Schema document . The inverse operation is used to convert  unmarshal  an XML document instance to an in-memory object, an object of a Java type or a comparable type in some other language. The wsgen utility thus produces the artifacts that support interoperability for a Java-based web  service.  The  JAX-B  libraries  provide  the  under-the-hood  support  to  convert  The wsgen Utility and JAX-B Artifacts   67  Download at Boykma.Com   between Java and XSD types. For the most part, the wsgen utility can be used without our bothering to inspect the artifacts that it produces. For the most part, JAX-B remains unseen infrastructure.  Beyond the Client-Side wsgen  A  web  service’s  SEI  contains  all  of  the  information  required  to  generate  the  wsgen artifacts.  After  all,  the  SEI  declares  the  service  operations  as  @WebMethods  and  these declarations specify argument and return types. In  the  current  Metro  release,  the  Endpoint  publisher  automatically  generates  the wsgen artifacts if the programmer does not. For example, once the sample service has been compiled, the command:  % java -cp .:$METRO_HOME lib jaxws-rt.jar test.WS1Pub  publishes the web service even though no wsgen artifacts were generated beforehand.  Under Windows, $METRO_HOME becomes %METRO_HOME%.  Here is the output:  com.sun.xml.ws.model.RuntimeModeler getRequestWrapperClass INFO: Dynamically creating request wrapper Class test.jaxws.Op com.sun.xml.ws.model.WrapperBeanGenerator createBeanImage INFO: @XmlRootElement name=op, namespace=http:  test   @XmlType name=op, namespace=http:  test   public class test.jaxws.Op {     @XmlRootElement name=arg0, namespace=      public I arg0 } com.sun.xml.ws.model.RuntimeModeler getResponseWrapperClass INFO: Dynamically creating response wrapper bean Class       test.jaxws.OpResponse com.sun.xml.ws.model.WrapperBeanGenerator createBeanImage INFO: @XmlRootElement name=opResponse, namespace=http:  test   @XmlType name=opResponse, namespace=http:  test   public class test.jaxws.OpResponse {     @XmlRootElement name=return, namespace=      public I _return }  In time this convenient feature of the Metro release will make its way into core Java so that the wsgen step in document-style services can be avoided. It is still helpful to un- derstand exactly how the JAX-B artifacts from the wsgen utility figure in Java-based web services.  Generating a WSDL with the wsgen Utility The wsgen utility also can be used to generate a WSDL document for a web service. For example, the command:  % wsgen -cp "." -wsdl ch01.ts.TimeServerImpl      68  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com   generates a WSDL for the original TimeServer service. The TimeServer service is rpc rather than document style, which is reflected in the WSDL. There is one critical differ- ence between the WSDL generated with the wsgen utility and the one retrieved at run- time after the web service has been published: the wsgen-generated WSDL does not include the service endpoint, as this URL depends on the actual publication of the service. Here is the relevant segment from the wsgen-generated WSDL:                     Except for this difference, the two WSDLs are the same service contract. Generating a WSDL directly from wsgen will be useful in later security examples. If a web service is secured, then so is its WSDL; hence, the first step in writing a wsimport- supported client to test the service is to access the WSDL, and wsgen is an easy way to take this step.  WSDL Wrap-Up This section completes the chapter with a look at two issues. The first issue is whether the web service code—in particular, its SEI and SIB—should come before or after the WSDL. In other words, should the WSDL be generated automatically from the service implementation or should the WSDL be designed and written before the web service code is written? This issue has been popularized as the code first versus the contract first  controversy.  The  second  issue  is  about  the  limited  information  that  a  WSDL provides to potential consumers of the corresponding web service.  Code First Versus Contract First The  issue  can  be  expressed  as  a  question:  should  the  web  service  code  be  used  to generate the WSDL automatically or should the WSDL, independently designed and created, be used to guide web service coding? All of the examples so far take the code- first approach because of its most obvious advantage: it is easy. However, there are some obvious shortcomings and even dangers in this approach, including:    If the service changes, the WSDL automatically changes. The WSDL thereby loses some of its appeal for creating client artifacts, as this process may have to be re- peated over and over. One of the first principles of software development is that an interface, once published, should be regarded as immutable so that code once written  against  a  published  interface  never  has  to  be  rewritten.  The  code-first approach may compromise this principle.    The code-first approach usually results in a service contract that provides few, if any, provisions for handling tricky but common problems in distributed systems  WSDL Wrap-Up  69  Download at Boykma.Com   such as partial failure of the service. The reason is that the service may be pro- grammed as if it were a standalone application rather than part of a distributed application with consumers on other hosts.    If the service implementation is complicated or even messy, these features carry over into a WSDL that may be difficult to understand and to use in the generation of client artifacts. In short, the code-first approach is clearly not consumer-oriented.   The code-first approach seems to go against the language-neutral theme of SOAP- based web services. If the contract is done first, then the implementation language remains open.  The list could go on and on. My aim, however, is not to jump into the fray but only to caution that the issue has merit. The core difficulty for the contract-first advocates is real-world programming practice. A programmer under the pressure of deadlines and application expectations is unlikely to have the time, let alone the inclination, to master the subtleties of WSDLs and then to produce a service contract that suitably guides the programming of the service. Even the WSDL generated for the simple TimeServer web service could use improve- ment. For example, here is a segment from the XML Schema for the document-style TimeServer web service:                            Note that the element for the returned value sets the minimum occurrences to 0 instead of 1. The reason is that the Java-based web service might return null, a valid value for a String type. To tighten up the service contract by requiring that a non-null string be returned, the 0 can be replaced with 1.  The minOccurs="0" also could be deleted be- cause the default value for minOccurs and maxOccurs is 1.   A Contract-First Example with wsimport The  wsimport  utility  can  be  used  in  support  of  a  contract-first  approach.

The service section  shown in bold  has two ports, one for a SOAP 1.1 version of the service and another for the SOAP 1.2 version. However, the location attributes for the two ports have the same value, which means that the same implementation is available at the two ports. The reason is found in the binding  that is, implementation  section. There are several ways in which two port elements, each a combination of a portType and a binding, could differ. The bind- ings could differ on the transport attribute with, for example, one binding delivering SOAP over HTTP and the other delivering SOAP over SMTP. The bindings also could differ, as in this example, on the SOAP version: the first is the SOAP 1.1 binding and the second is the SOAP 1.2 binding. However, the service is simple enough that no differences arise because of the SOAP 1.1 versus SOAP 1.2 binding. The two bindings and, therefore, the two ports are identical in this case. The wsimport utility can be used with the WSDL for the C service to generate the usual artifacts that aid in writing a client. Here is the command:  % wsimport -p tcClient -extension  http:  localhost:1443 TempConvert Service.asmx?wsdl  The -extension flag is used because the WSDL includes a SOAP 1.2 binding. With these artifacts, the sample client code is straightforward:  import tcClient.Service; import tcClient.ServiceSoap;    port     A sample Java client against a C web service class ClientDotNet {    public static void main String[ ] args  {       Service service = new Service  ;          There's also a getServiceSoap12 for the SOAP 1.2 binding       ServiceSoap port = service.getServiceSoap  ;  WSDL Wrap-Up  73  Download at Boykma.Com         double temp = 98.7;       System.out.println port.c2F temp  ;    209.65999450683594       System.out.println port.f2C temp  ;     37.05555386013455    } }  However, the main point of this section is to show how the same WSDL also can be used to generate a Java version of the service itself. Although the WSDL for the C web service is generated automatically, the origin of the WSDL is unimportant in this example. Further, the WSDL could be edited to make whatever changes seem appropriate and perhaps even rewritten from scratch. The point of interest is that the WSDL is language-neutral; hence, the service that the WSDL describes can be implemented in Java rather than C. For the sake of the example, the critical point is that the WSDL does not come from Java. Several details in this WSDL do not make sense for a Java implementation of the service described therein. For one, the service location ends with Service.asmx, the file name of the C implementation. This detail might be changed in the WSDL. Other changes might be made as well; for instance, the service’s port is currently ServiceSoap instead of  something  more  suggestive  such  as  TempConvert.  In  this  example,  however,  the WSDL will be left as is and changes will be made instead to the wsimport-generated Java code. Assuming this time that the WDSL is in the local file named tempc.wsdl, the command:  % wsimport -keep -p  ch02.tc tempc.wsdl  generates  the  wsimport  artifacts  in  the  subdirectory  ch02 tc.  Of  interest  is  the  Java counterpart to the WSDL portTypeM; in this case it is the file ServiceSoap.java, which contains the segment:  @WebService name = "ServiceSoap",             targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org "  public interface ServiceSoap {     @WebMethod operationName = "c2f",                action = "http:  tempConvertURI.org c2f"      @WebResult name = "c2fResult",                targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org "      @RequestWrapper localName = "c2f",                     targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org ",                     className = "ch02.tc.C2F"      @ResponseWrapper localName = "c2fResponse",                      targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org ",                      className = "ch02.tc.C2FResponse"      public double c2F          @WebParam name = "t", targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org "          double t ; ...  This  interface  is  the  SEI,  but  it  is  easily  transformed  into  the  SIB  as  well:  first,  the keyword interface is changed to the keyword class; second, the method declarations  74  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com    only the declaration for c2F is shown here  are changed to method definitions. A third but optional step is to drop the service name ServiceSoap in favor of something more suggestive such as the name TempConvert. Here is the SIB that results from changes to the SEI:  package ch02.tc;  import javax.jws.WebMethod; import javax.jws.WebParam; import javax.jws.WebResult; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.xml.ws.RequestWrapper; import javax.xml.ws.ResponseWrapper; @WebService name = "TempConvert", targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org "  public class TempConvert {     @WebMethod operationName = "c2f",                action = "http:  tempConvertURI.org c2f"      @WebResult name = "c2fResult",                targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org "      @RequestWrapper localName = "c2f",                     targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org ",                     className = "ch02.tc.C2F"      @ResponseWrapper localName = "c2fResponse",                      targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org ",                      className = "ch02.tc.C2FResponse"      public double c2F          @WebParam name = "t",                   targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org "          double t  { return 32.0 +  t * 9.0   5.0 ; }      @WebMethod operationName = "f2c",                action = "http:  tempConvertURI.org f2c"      @WebResult name = "f2cResult",                targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org "      @RequestWrapper localName = "f2c",                     targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org ",                     className = "ch02.tc.F2C"      @ResponseWrapper localName = "f2cResponse",                      targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org ",                      className = "ch02.tc.F2CResponse"      public double f2C          @WebParam name = "t",                   targetNamespace = "http:  tempConvertURI.org "          double t  { return  5.0   9.0  *  t - 32.0 ; }  }        Once  this  Java-based  web  service  is  published  in  the  usual  way  using  the  method Endpoint.publish, the wsimport utility can be used again but this time to generate client- side support code:  % wsimport -keep -p clientTC http:  localhost:5599 tc?wsdl        A Java client such as ClientTC below then can be coded:  WSDL Wrap-Up  75  Download at Boykma.Com   import javax.xml.ws.Service; import clientTC.TempConvertService; import clientTC.TempConvert;  class ClientTC {     public static void main String args[ ]  throws Exception {         TempConvertService service = new TempConvertService  ;         TempConvert port = service.getTempConvertPort  ;         double d1 = -40.1, d2 = -39.4;         System.out.printf "f2C %f  = %f\n", d1, port.f2C d1  ;         System.out.printf "c2F %f  = %f\n", d2, port.c2F d2  ;    } }  When executed, this client outputs:  f2C -40.100000  = -40.055556 c2F -39.400000  = -38.920000  The example shows that the artifacts generated from wsimport can be used to support a Java client against a web service or to implement web service in Java. With a WSDL in hand, a Java implementation of the service is within reach.  A Code-First, Contract-Aware Approach JWS  also  supports  a  code-first,  contract-aware  approach.  JWS  encourages  the  code first by making it easy to generate the WSDL. Once the service is published, the WSDL is generated automatically and available to clients. Java, however, does provide anno- tations that the programmer can use in order to determine, in critical areas, how the generated WSDL or, in turn, WSDL-generated artifacts will turn out. Example 2-23 shows yet another revision of the TimeServer service. For illustration, the web service is now implemented as a single file, TimeServer.java, and various annotations have been added so that their impact on the automatically generated WSDL and on SOAP mes- sages can be seen.  Example 2-23. A code-first, contract-aware service  package ch02.tsa;     'a' for 'annotation'  import java.util.Date; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod; import javax.jws.Oneway; import javax.jws.WebParam; import javax.jws.WebParam.Mode; import javax.jws.WebResult; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.Style; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.Use; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle;  76  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com   @WebService name            = "AnnotatedTimeServer",             serviceName     = "RevisedTimeServer",             targetNamespace = "http:  ch02.tsa"  @SOAPBinding style          = SOAPBinding.Style.DOCUMENT,              use            = SOAPBinding.Use.LITERAL,              parameterStyle = SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle.WRAPPED  public class TimeServer {     @WebMethod operationName   = "time_string"      @WebResult name            = "ts_out",                targetNamespace = "http:  ch02.tsa"      public String getTimeAsString         @WebParam name            = "client_message",                  targetNamespace = "http:  ch02.tsa",                  mode            = WebParam.Mode.IN         String msg  {           return msg + " at " + new Date  .toString  ;     }      @WebMethod  operationName = "time_elapsed"      public long getTimeAsElapsed   { return new Date  .getTime  ; }      @WebMethod     @Oneway     public void acceptInput String msg  { System.out.println msg ; } }       Let’s begin with the @WebService annotation, which includes attribute settings in this revision. Once the publisher application is running, with the revised TimeServer service available at port 8888, the command:  % wsimport -keep -p clientA http:  localhost:8888 tsa?wsdl        generates the usual artifacts in subdirectory clientA. In the @WebService annotation, the:  attribute causes the service artifact to be the class named RevisedTimeServer, and the:  serviceName = RevisedTimeServer  name = AnnotatedTimeServer  attribute  causes  the  portType  artifact  to  be  the  class  named  AnnotatedTimeServer. The Java client against the revised service illustrates these points:  import clientA.RevisedTimeServer; import clientA.AnnotatedTimeServer;  class TimeClientA {     public static void main String[ ] args  {         RevisedTimeServer ts = new RevisedTimeServer  ;         AnnotatedTimeServer ats = ts.getAnnotatedTimeServerPort  ;          System.out.println ats.timeString "Hi, world!"  ;         System.out.println ats.timeElapsed   ;         ats.acceptInput "Hello, world!" ;     } }      WSDL Wrap-Up  77  Download at Boykma.Com   In the revised TimeServer, the targetNamespace is set to http:  ch02.tsa  with no trailing slash  ensures that this will be the namespace URI for the service in the WSDL; in other words, the ch02.tsa will not be inverted to tsa.ch02, which occurred in effect in the original TimeServer service. The @SOAPBinding attributes, set to their default values, are included for illustration. The getTimeAsString method is the most heavily annotated of the three @WebMethods, with  both  a  @WebResult  and  a  @WebParam  annotation.  This  method  and  the  method getTimeAsElapsed  have  their  operational  names  explicitly  set  to  time_string  and time_elapsed, respectively. Here is the segment from the WSDL’s message section that reflects these settings. Note, too, that the message names reflect the operation names, as is standard in the wrapped document style:                                             The @WebResult annotation of the getTimeAsString method does not impact the WSDL but rather the SOAP response message; in particular the subelement with the tag name ns1:ts_out in the wrapped SOAP body:    <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "                   xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"                   xmlns:ns1="http:  ch02.tsa">                  Hi, world! at Thu Oct 23 22:24:59 CDT 2008                     The @WebMethod named acceptInput is annotated as @Oneway, which requires that the method  return  void.  As  a  result,  a  client  can  send  a  request  to  the  parameterized acceptInput operation but receives no response. Following is the WSDL segment that defines the operation with only an input message and no output message.                  78  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com   The example shows some of the possibilities in JWS’s code-first, contract-aware ap- proach. If the web service creator is willing to accept defaults, the JWS annotations such as @WebService and @WebMethod are clear and simple. If fine-grained control over the WSDL and the SOAP messages is required, such control is available with additional annotations.  Limitations of the WSDL WSDL documents, as web service descriptions, should be publishable and discovera- ble. A UDDI  Universal Description Discovery and Integration  registry is one way to publish WSDLs so that potential clients can discover them and ultimately consume the services that the WSDLs describe. UDDI does not directly support any particular type of service description, including WSDL, but instead provides its own type system that accommodates WSDL documents. In UDDI terms, a WSDL is essentially a two-part document. The first part, which comprises the types through the binding sections, is the UDDI service interface. The second part, which comprises any import directives and the service section, is the UDDI service implementation. In WSDL, the service interface and service implementation are two parts of the same document. In UDDI, the two parts are separate documents. Once a WSDL has been located, perhaps through a UDDI service, critical questions remain about the service described in the WSDL. For one, the WSDL does not explain service semantics or, in plainer terms, what the service is about. The WSDL precisely describes what might be called the service’s invocation syntax: the names of the service operations; the expected pattern for a service operation  e.g., request response ; the number, order, and type of arguments that each operation expects; fault codes, if any, associated with a service operation; and the number and types of any response values from the service. The Amazon E-Commerce WSDL, which has about 3,640 lines, con- tains such information for all of the many operations that the service provides. Yet the WSDL itself contains no information about the intended use of the service. Figuring this out is left to the programmer, who, drawing presumably on experience with the Amazon  website,  recognizes  from  service  operation  names  such  as  itemSearch, sellerLookup, and cartCreate that the E-Commerce service is meant to replicate the functionality available from a browser-based session at the Amazon website. Amazon does provide supplementary material such as documentation, tutorials, and sample code libraries, all of which are meant to provide the semantic information that the WSDL itself does not provide. The W3C is pursuing initiatives in web semantics under the rubric of WSDL-S  Semantics . For more information on WSDL-S, see http:  www .w3.org Submission WSDL-S. As of now, a WSDL typically is useful only if the client programmer already understands what the service is about.  WSDL Wrap-Up  79  Download at Boykma.Com   What’s Next? SOAP-based web services in Java have two levels. The application level, which consists of the service itself and any Java-based client, typically and appropriately hides the SOAP. The handler level, which consists of SOAP message interceptors on either the service or the client side, can manipulate the SOAP. At times it is useful to handle the SOAP directly, as the next chapter illustrates. Chapter 3 also looks at how SOAP- based web services can transport large binary payloads efficiently.  80  Chapter 2: All About WSDLs  Download at Boykma.Com   CHAPTER 3 SOAP Handling  SOAP: Hidden or Not? Until now we have looked at SOAP messages only to see how SOAP-based web services operate under the hood. After all, the point of JWS is to develop and consume web services, ignoring infrastructure whenever possible. It is one thing to track web service messages at the wire level in order to see what is really going on. It is quite another to process SOAP messages in support of application logic. At times, however, a web service or a client might need to process a SOAP envelope. For example, a client might need to add security credentials to the header of a SOAP message before sending the message; and the web service that receives the message then might need to validate these security credentials after extracting them from the header of the incoming SOAP message. How to add, extract, and otherwise process informa- tion in a SOAP message is the main topic in this chapter. The goal is to illustrate tech- niques  for  dealing  directly  with  SOAP  messages  in  SOAP-based  web  services.  This chapter also examines SOAP attachments, particularly for large binary payloads.  SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 SOAP now comes in two versions, 1.1 and 1.2. There is debate within the W3C about whether a version 1.3 is needed. The good news is that the differences between SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 have minor impact on programming web services in general and programming JAX-WS in particular. There are exceptions. For example, the structure of  the  SOAP  header  differs  between  the  versions,  which  can  impact  programming. Figure 3-1 depicts the general structure of a SOAP message under either 1.1 or 1.2.  81  Download at Boykma.Com   Figure 3-1. The structure of a SOAP Message  Under either version, SOAP messages can be manipulated through handlers, which are programmer-written classes that contain callbacks; that is, methods invoked from the web service runtime so that an application has access to the underlying SOAP. At what might be called the application level, which consists of web services and their clients, the SOAP remains hidden. At the handler level, the SOAP is exposed so that the pro- grammer can manipulate the incoming and outgoing messages. Even at the handler level, most differences between 1.1 and 1.2 amount to refinements that usually can be ignored. For example, SOAP 1.1 technically allows XML elements to occur after the SOAP body. In SOAP 1.2, by contrast, the SOAP body is the last XML element in the SOAP envelope. Even in SOAP 1.1, however, it is only in contrived examples that a SOAP envelope contains XML elements in the wasteland between the end of the SOAP body and the end of the SOAP envelope. The 1.1 version binds SOAP to HTTP transport, whereas the 1.2 version also supports SOAP over SMTP. The SOAP 1.1 specification is a single document, but the SOAP 1.2 specification is divided into three documents. In JAX-WS, as in most frameworks, SOAP 1.1 is the default and SOAP 1.2 is an option readily available, as examples in this chapter illustrate. Finally, starting with the 1.2 version, SOAP is officially no longer an acronym!  SOAP Messaging Architecture A SOAP message is a one-way transmission from a sender to a receiver; hence, the fundamental message exchange pattern  MEP  for SOAP is one way. SOAP-based ap- plications such as web services are free to set up conversational patterns that combine one-way messaging in richer ways. The request response MEP in a SOAP-based web service is a brief conversation in which a request initiates the conversion and a response concludes the conversation. MEPs such as request response and solicit response can be put together in suitable ways to support more expansive conversational patterns as needed.  82  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  SOAP message  Optional SOAP header  Required SOAP body  SOAP envelope  Optional SOAP attachments  Download at Boykma.Com   Although a SOAP message is intended for an ultimate receiver, the SOAP messaging architecture  allows  for  SOAP  intermediaries,  which  are  nonterminal  recipients  or nodes along the route from the sender to the ultimate receiver. An intermediary may inspect and even manipulate an incoming SOAP message before sending the message on its way toward the ultimate receiver. Figure 3-2 depicts a SOAP sender, two inter- mediaries, and an ultimate receiver.  Figure 3-2. Sender, intermediaries, and receiver  Recall that a SOAP envelope has a required body, which may be empty, and an optional header. An intermediary should inspect and process only the elements in the SOAP header rather than anything in the SOAP body, which carries whatever cargo the sender intends for the ultimate receiver alone. The header, by contrast, is meant to carry what- ever meta-information is appropriate for either the ultimate receiver or intermediaries. For example, the header might contain the sender’s digital signature as a voucher or include a timestamp that indicates when the information in the message’s body be- comes obsolete. XML elements within the optional header are header blocks in SOAP speak. Example 3-1 shows a SOAP message with a SOAP 1.1 header, which in turn contains a header block tagged uddi.  Example 3-1. A sample SOAP header               <uuid xmlns="http:  ch03.fib"             xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "             SOAP-ENV:actor="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap actor next">          ca12fd33-16e1-4a95-b17e-3ef6744babdc                                     45                  The header block tagged with uddi contains a UUID  Universally Unique IDentifier  value, which is a 128-bit number formatted as a string with hexadecimal numerals. As the name suggests, a UDDI is meant to be a statistically unique identifier, in this case an identifier for this particular request against the RabbitCounter web service, which is introduced shortly. The assumption in this example is that every request against the RabbitCounter service would have its own UUID, which might be logged with other information for later analysis.  SOAP: Hidden or Not?   83  Sender  Intermediary 1  Intermediary 2  Receiver  Download at Boykma.Com   The header block with the uddi tag has an attribute, SOAP-ENV:actor, whose value ends with next. The next actor, in this scheme, is the next recipient on the path from the message sender to the ultimate receiver; hence, each intermediary  and the ultimate receiver  acts in a next role. A next actor is expected to inspect header blocks in some application-appropriate way. If a node cannot process the header block, then the node should throw a fault. In SOAP 1.2, this expectation can be made explicit by setting the mustUnderstand attribute of a header block to true, which means that a node must throw a fault if the node cannot process the header block. The SOAP specification does not explain exactly how an intermediate or final node must  process  a  header  block,  as  this  is  an  application-specific  rather  than  a  SOAP requirement. In this example, the next node might check whether the UUID value is well-formed under an application-mandated algorithm such as SHA-1  Secure Hash Algorithm-1 .  If  the  value  cannot  be  verified  as  well-formed,  then  the  node  should throw a fault to signal this fact. Of interest here is how a header such as the one in Example 3-1 can be generated. By default, JWS generates a SOAP request message without a header. The next section examines how application code can generate the SOAP message in Example 3-1.  Programming in the JWS Handler Framework JWS provides a handler framework that allows application code to inspect and manip- ulate outgoing and incoming SOAP messages. A handler can be injected into the frame- work in two steps:  1. One step is to create a handler class, which implements the Handler interface in the javax.xml.ws.handler  package.  JWS  provides  two  Handler  subinterfaces, LogicalHandler  and  SOAPHandler.  As  the  names  suggest,  the  LogicalHandler  is protocol-neutral but the SOAPHandler is SOAP-specific. A LogicalHandler has access only to the message payload in the SOAP body, whereas a SOAPHandler has access to the entire SOAP message, including any optional headers and attachments. The class that implements either the LogicalHandler or the SOAPHandler interface needs to define three methods for either interface type, including handleMessage, which gives  the  programmer  access  to  the  underlying  message.  The  other  two  shared methods are handleFault and close. The SOAPHandler interface requires the imple- mentation to define a fourth method, getHeaders. These methods are explained best through code examples.  2. The other step is to place a handler within a handler chain. This is typically done through a configuration file, although handlers also can be managed through code. An example follows shortly.  Once injected into the handler framework, a programmer-written handler acts as a message interceptor that has access to every incoming and outgoing message. Under the  request response  message  exchange  pattern   MEP ,  for  instance,  a  client-side  84  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   handler has access to the outgoing request message after the message has been created but before the message is sent to the web service. The same client-side handler has access to the incoming response message from the web service. A service-side handler under this MEP has access to the incoming request message and to the outgoing re- sponse message after the response message has been created. The JWS handler framework thus encourages the chain of responsibility pattern, which Java servlet programmers encounter when using filters. The underlying idea is to dis- tribute responsibility among various handlers so that the overall application is highly modular and, therefore, more easily maintainable.  The RabbitCounter Example Now we can drill down into the details with an example, which introduces constructs that will be useful in later examples. Following is a summary of what the example does:    The RabbitCounter service has one operation, countRabbits, that expects a single integer argument and returns an integer. The operation computes the Fibonacci numbers, which are relevant in botany, engineering, computer science, aesthetics, market trading, and even rabbit breeding. The sample operation needs to be par- ameterized so that SOAP faults can be illustrated. In this example, a SOAP fault is thrown if the argument is a negative integer. The example thus provides a first look at SOAP faults.    The service, its clients, and any intermediaries along the route from client to service are expected to process SOAP headers. In particular, a client injects a header block into an outgoing  that is, request  message and any intermediary and the ultimate receiver validate the information in the header block, generating a SOAP fault if necessary. In later examples, header blocks will be used to carry credentials such as digital signatures. For now, the details of injecting and processing header blocks are of primary interest.    JWS has two different ways to throw SOAP faults and the example illustrates both. The simplest way is to extend the Exception class  for example, with a class named FibException  and to throw the exception in a @WebMethod whenever appropriate. JWS then automatically maps the Java exception to a SOAP fault. The other way, which  takes  more  work,  is  to  throw  a  fault  from  a  handler.  In  this  case,  a SOAPFaultException is created and then thrown.  The following sections flesh out the details.  Injecting a Header Block into a SOAP Header The header block in Example 3-1 comes from the client-side handler shown in Exam- ple 3-2.  SOAP: Hidden or Not?   85  Download at Boykma.Com   Example 3-2. A handler that injects a SOAP header block  package fibC;  import java.util.UUID; import java.util.Set; import java.util.logging.Logger; import javax.xml.namespace.QName; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPMessage; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPHandler; import javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPMessageContext; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPEnvelope; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPHeader; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPHeaderElement; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPException; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPConstants; import java.io.IOException;  public class UUIDHandler implements SOAPHandler  {     private static final String LoggerName = "ClientSideLogger";     private Logger logger;     private final boolean log_p = true;    set to false to turn off     public UUIDHandler   {         logger = Logger.getLogger LoggerName ;     }      public boolean handleMessage SOAPMessageContext ctx  {        if  log_p  logger.info "handleMessage" ;            Is this an outbound message, i.e., a request?        Boolean request_p =  Boolean             ctx.get MessageContext.MESSAGE_OUTBOUND_PROPERTY ;            Manipulate the SOAP only if it's a request        if  request_p  {              Generate a UUID and a timestamp to place in the message header.           UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID  ;            try {              SOAPMessage msg = ctx.getMessage  ;              SOAPEnvelope env = msg.getSOAPPart  .getEnvelope  ;              SOAPHeader hdr = env.getHeader  ;                 Ensure that the SOAP message has a header.              if  hdr == null  hdr = env.addHeader  ;               QName qname = new QName "http:  ch03.fib", "uuid" ;              SOAPHeaderElement helem = hdr.addHeaderElement qname ;               helem.setActor SOAPConstants.URI_SOAP_ACTOR_NEXT ;    default              helem.addTextNode uuid.toString   ;              msg.saveChanges  ;                  For tracking, write to standard output.              msg.writeTo System.out ;           }  86  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com             catch SOAPException e  { System.err.println e ; }           catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; }        }         return true;    continue down the chain     }          public boolean handleFault SOAPMessageContext ctx  {        if  log_p  logger.info "handleFault" ;        try {           ctx.getMessage  .writeTo System.out ;        }        catch SOAPException e  { System.err.println e ; }        catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; }        return true;      }        public Set  getHeaders   {         if  log_p  logger.info "getHeaders" ;        return null;     }           public void close MessageContext messageContext  {         if  log_p  logger.info "close" ;     } }  Because the UUIDHandler is a client-side handler and the MEP is request response, the handleMessage method is invoked by the framework after the underlying SOAP request message  has  been  constructed  but  before  the  request  message  has  been  sent  to  the service. Suppose that this handler is configured to work with TestClient, which is the client of a SOAP-based service TestService. The details of the configuration will be given shortly. For now, here is a summary of what happens given a TestClient against a TestService and a client-side UUIDHandler:  1. Whenever the TestClient generates a request against the TestService, the client-  side JWS libraries create a SOAP message that serves as the request.  2. Once  the  SOAP  message  has  been  created  but  before  the  message  is  sent,  the UUIDHandler callbacks are invoked. In particular, the callback handleMessage has access to the full SOAP message because the encapsulating class UUIDHandler is a SOAPHandler rather than a LogicalHandler, which would have access only to the message payload. The handleMessage callback injects a UUID value into the header of the SOAP message.  3. After the UUIDHandler has done its work, the SOAP request message with the in- jected header block is sent on its way to the ultimate receiver, which in this case is the TestService.  Here are some additional details about the process. The same UUIDHandler has access to the incoming or response message. The method  handleMessage has an argument SOAPMessageContext, which gives access to the underlying SOAP message. Accordingly,  SOAP: Hidden or Not?   87  Download at Boykma.Com   the handleMessage callback first checks whether the SOAP is outgoing  that is, a request from the client’s perspective . For an outgoing message, the handler generates a UUID value to place in a header block. One problem is that the SOAP header is optional under either SOAP 1.1 or SOAP 1.2. So the handler checks whether the already-created SOAP message has a header and, if not, adds a header to the SOAP envelope. Next, an instance of a SOAPHeaderElement, the Java implementation of a header block, is added to the SOAP header, and the actor attribute is added using a set method. Here is the code segment:  SOAPHeaderElement helem = hdr.addHeaderElement qname ; helem.setActor SOAPConstants.URI_SOAP_ACTOR_NEXT ;    the default     The UUID value is added to the header as an XML text node and the overall changes to the SOAP message are saved. The outgoing SOAP message reflects the changes. Here, for review, is the relevant segment of the SOAP header after the handler executes and the additions have been saved:       <uuid xmlns="http:  ch03.fib"          xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "           SOAP-ENV:actor="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap actor next">       ca12fd33-16e1-4a95-b17e-3ef6744babdc         For now, the UUIDHandler in Example 3-2 happens to be the only handler in the handler chain  that is, the sequence of handlers  active in the service client, FibClient. There could be other handlers, each with a position within the chain. Although the handler chain can be set up in code, it is cleaner to describe the chain in a deployment file. Example 3-3 is the deployment file handler-chain.xml, although any name will do.  Example 3-3. A handler deployment file    <javaee:handler-chains       xmlns:javaee="http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee"       xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema">                  fibC.UUIDHandler                     If there were other handlers, any mix of LogicalHandler and SOAPHandler implementa- tions, these would be listed before or after the listing of fibC.UUIDHandler, the fully qualified name of the class in Example 3-2. Handler methods of one type  for instance, handleMessage methods in SOAPHandlers  execute in order, from top to bottom, unless one of the executing handler methods halts handler processing altogether. A handler method halts execution of the remaining handlers in the chain as follows. The methods handleMessage and handleFault return boolean values. A returned true means continue  88  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   message  processing  by  executing  the  next  handler  in  the  chain,  whereas  a  returned false  means  stop  message  processing.  If  a  handler  stops  processing  on  an  outgoing message  for instance, a client request message or a service response message , then the message is not sent. The top-to-bottom sequence of the handlers in the configuration file determines the order in which handler methods of one type  e.g., SOAPHandler  execute. The runtime ordering may differ from the order given in the configuration file. Here is the reason:    For an outbound message  for instance, a client request under the request response MEP , the handleMessage method or handleFault method in a LogicalHandler code execute before their counterparts in a SOAPHandler.    For an inbound message, the handleMessage method or handleFault method in a  SOAPHandler code execute before their counterparts in a LogicalHandler.  For example, suppose that a handler configuration file lists SOAP handlers  SH  and logical handlers  LH  in this order, top to bottom:  Despite the order in the configuration file, the handlers execute in this order, top to bottom, on an outgoing message:  On an incoming message, the handlers execute in this order, top to bottom:  Figure 3-3 depicts the runtime ordering of logical and SOAP handlers. This runtime ordering makes sense because the LogicalHandler has access only to the body of the SOAP message, whereas the SOAPHandler has access to the entire SOAP message. For an outgoing message, then, the logical handlers should be able to process the payload, the SOAP body, before the SOAP handlers process the entire SOAP message. If the application  does  not  need  to  process  SOAP  headers  or  SOAP  attachments,  then  a LogicalHandler is the way to go.

Organization of logical and message handlers  The deployment file, in this case handler-chain.xml, can be located anywhere on the classpath.  In  this  example,  the  file  is  in  the  fibC  subdirectory,  which  is  the  named package for the wsimport-generated stubs. The compiled client, FibClient.class, is in the parent directory of fibC. The reasons for this layout are given in the next section. In any case, here is the FibClient code:  import fibC.RabbitCounterService; import fibC.RabbitCounter;  class FibClient {     public static void main String[ ] args  {         RabbitCounterService service = new RabbitCounterService  ;         RabbitCounter port = service.getRabbitCounterPort  ;         try {             int n = -45;             System.out.println "fib " + n + "  = " + port.countRabbits n  ;         }         catch Exception e  { System.err.println e ; }     } }        The call to the web service method countRabbits occurs in a try block because this method throws a SOAP fault on a negative argument, as in this case. Otherwise, the client pattern is quite familiar by now. Finally, the UUIDHandler also is used to provide a wire-level dump of the outgoing SOAP message.  In  Java,  SOAP  handlers  are  thus  an  alternative  to  a  dump  utility  such  as tcpmon or tcpdump.  90  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Sender  Receiver  L o g i c a l  H a n d l e r s  M e s s a g e  H a n d l e r s  M e s s a g e  H a n d l e r s  L o g i c a l  H a n d l e r s  Download at Boykma.Com   Configuring the Client-Side SOAP Handler The FibClient sends requests to the ch03.fib.RabbitCounter web service, as shown in Example 3-4.  Example 3-4. The RabbitCounter service  package ch03.fib;    import java.util.Map; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Collections; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.Style; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.Use; import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle;  @WebService targetNamespace = "http:  ch03.fib"  @SOAPBinding style          = SOAPBinding.Style.DOCUMENT,              use            = SOAPBinding.Use.LITERAL,              parameterStyle = SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle.WRAPPED  public class RabbitCounter {        stores previously computed values     private Map  cache =         Collections.synchronizedMap new HashMap    ;      @WebMethod     public int countRabbits int n  throws FibException {            Throw a fault if n is negative.         if  n < 0  throw new FibException "Neg. arg. not allowed.", n + " < 0" ;             Easy cases.         if  n < 2  return n;             Return cached values if present.         if  cache.containsKey n   return cache.get n ;         if  cache.containsKey n - 1  &&             cache.containsKey n - 2   {            cache.put n, cache.get n - 1  + cache.get n - 2  ;            return cache.get n ;         }             Otherwise, compute from scratch, cache, and return.         int fib = 1, prev = 0;         for  int i = 2; i <= n; i++  {             int temp = fib;             fib += prev;             prev = temp;         }         cache.put n, fib ;    cache value for later lookup         return fib;     } }    SOAP: Hidden or Not?   91  Download at Boykma.Com   The  service  has  only  one  operation,  countRabbits.  The  Fibonacci  numbers  can  be computed using recursion, but this technique is inefficient. Although this recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers:           undefined if n < 0 fib n  = n if 0 <= n < 2          fib n - 1  + fib n - 2  otherwise  converts straightforwardly into a Java method:  int fib int n  {    if  n < 0  throw new RuntimeException "Undefined for negative values." ;    if  n < 2  return n;                     base case    else return fib n - 1  + fib n - 2 ;     recursive calls }        the recursive implementation repeats computations. For instance, the call to fib 5  computes fib 2  three separate times under the recursive implementation. The base case for the recursive definition of the fib function occurs when n = 1. If n >= 2, then fib n  computes the base case fib n - 1  times, which is highly inefficient for large values of n. Although the RabbitCounter service may be whimsical, there are common- sensical applications of the Fibonacci numbers. Suppose, for instance, that someone is able to take a normal step of 1 meter and a jump step of 2 meters. How many ways can this person traverse, say, a 100 meters? The answer is fib 100 : 3,314,859,971. The web service operation countRabbits does not recompute any values in computing fib n . Further, this implementation caches previously computed values so that these may be looked up rather than computed from scratch in subsequent calls. Our  real  interest  is  in  the  client-side  handlers,  which  intercept  the  request  SOAP messages sent to the RabbitCounterService and the response SOAP messages returned from  this  service.  The  next  step  is  to  indicate  where  the  configuration  file  for  the handler  chain  is  to  be  found.  The  wsimport-generated  stub  for  the  service, fibC.RabbitCounterService, is an obvious place to point to the configuration file. Here is the @HandlerChain annotation added to the stub:  import javax.jws.HandlerChain; @WebServiceClient name = "RabbitCounterService",                    targetNamespace = "http:  ch03.fib",                    wsdlLocation = "http:  localhost:8888 fib?wsdl"  @HandlerChain file = "handler-chain.xml"  public class RabbitCounterService extends Service {  The configuration file can be anywhere on the classpath; hence, it is convenient to place it in the same fibC subdirectory that holds the wsimport-generated files.  Adding a Handler Programmatically on the Client Side Managing handlers through a configuration file is the preferred way but not the only way. It is preferred because this way keeps the client or service code relatively clean. Handlers are at the edge of application logic rather than at the center; hence, they are  92  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   usually managed best through metadata files such as handler-chain.xml in the current example. Nonetheless, it is not hard to manage handlers programmatically. Example 3-5 is a revised client against the RabbitCounter service.  Example 3-5. A client that configures a handler programmatically  import fibC.RabbitCounterService; import fibC.RabbitCounter; import fibC.UUIDHandler; import fibC.TestHandler;   import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList; import javax.xml.ws.handler.Handler; import javax.xml.ws.handler.HandlerResolver; import javax.xml.ws.handler.PortInfo;  class FibClientHR {     public static void main String[ ] args  {         RabbitCounterService service = new RabbitCounterService  ;         service.setHandlerResolver new ClientHandlerResolver   ;         RabbitCounter port = service.getRabbitCounterPort  ;          try {            int n = 27;            System.out.printf "fib %d  = %d\n", n, port.countRabbits n  ;         }         catch Exception e  { System.err.println e ; }     } } class ClientHandlerResolver implements HandlerResolver {     public List  getHandlerChain PortInfo port_info  {         List  hchain = new ArrayList   ;         hchain.add new UUIDHandler   ;         hchain.add new TestHandler   ;    for illustration only     } }  The file FibClientHR.java has two classes, FibClientHR and ClientHandlerResolver. The HandlerResolver interface declares only one method, getHandlerChain, which the run- time  invokes  to  get  a  list  of  the  handlers.  In  FibClientHR,  the  setHandlerResolver method is invoked on the service object:  service.setHandlerResolver new ClientHandlerResolver   ;  As a result, the configuration file handle-chain.xml now plays no role in the handler configuration. Instead, the code takes on this management role. The example adds a second handler, TestHandler, to illustrate the intuitive ordering. The UUIDHandler comes first in the handler chain and so is executed first. By the way, the TestHandler simply prints the SOAP message to the standard output for tracking purposes.  SOAP: Hidden or Not?   93  Download at Boykma.Com   Generating a Fault from a @WebMethod The RabbitCounter service includes a customized exception that the @WebMethod named countRabbits throws if the method is invoked with a negative integer as an argument. Here is the code segment in the method definition:  @WebMethod public int countRabbits int n  throws FibException {      Throw a fault if n is negative.   if  n < 0  throw new FibException "Negative args not allowed.", n + " < 0" ;  And here is the customized exception class:  package ch03.fib;  public class FibException extends Exception {     private String details;     public FibException String reason, String details  {       super reason ;       this.details = details;     }     public String getFaultInfo   { return details; } }  If a FibException is thrown in the countRabbits operation, a fault message rather than an output message becomes the service’s response to the client. For example, here is the response from a call with -999 as the argument:                    <ns3:Fault xmlns:ns2="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "                   xmlns:ns3="http:  www.w3.org 2003 05 soap-envelope">            ns3:Receiver                           Negative args not allowed.                                                      -999                   Negative args not allowed.                                    ...                      The SOAP fault message includes the Reason, which is the first argument in the con- structor call:  new FibException "Negative args not allowed.", n + " < 0" ;    94  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   and additional Detail, which is the second argument in the constructor call. The re- sponse fault message is large, with a wealth of detail. The segment shown above con- tains the essentials. When the service is published, the generated WSDL likewise reflects that the service can throw a SOAP fault. The WSDL includes a message to implement the exception and the portType section includes a fault message together with the usual input and output messages. Here are the relevant WSDL segments:                                                     Throwing a SOAP fault from a @WebMethod is straightforward. The Exception-based class that implements the SOAP fault in Java should have a constructor with two arguments, the first of which gives the reason for the fault  a negative argument, in this example  and the second of which provides additional details about the fault. The Exception- based class should define a getFaultInfo method that returns the fault details. The corresponding SOAP fault message includes the reason and the details.  Adding a Logical Handler for Client Robustness The RabbitCounter service throws a SOAP fault if the method countRabbits is called with a negative argument. A LogicalHandler on the client side could intercept the out- going request, check the argument to countRabbits, and change the argument if it is negative. The ArgHandler in Example 3-6 does just this.  Example 3-6. A logical handler for robustness  package fibC;  import javax.xml.ws.LogicalMessage; import javax.xml.ws.handler.LogicalHandler; import javax.xml.ws.handler.LogicalMessageContext; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import java.util.logging.Logger;  import javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext; import javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement; import javax.xml.bind.JAXBException;  public class ArgHandler implements LogicalHandler  {     private static final String LoggerName = "ArgLogger";     private Logger logger;     private final boolean log_p = true;    set to false to turn off   SOAP: Hidden or Not?   95  Download at Boykma.Com       public ArgHandler   {          logger = Logger.getLogger LoggerName ;     }         If outgoing message argument is negative, make non-negative.     public boolean handleMessage LogicalMessageContext ctx  {         Boolean outbound_p =  Boolean              ctx.get MessageContext.MESSAGE_OUTBOUND_PROPERTY ;         if  outbound_p  {            if  log_p  logger.info "ArgHandler.handleMessage" ;            LogicalMessage msg = ctx.getMessage  ;             try {               JAXBContext jaxb_ctx = JAXBContext.newInstance "fibC" ;               Object payload = msg.getPayload jaxb_ctx ;               if  payload instanceof JAXBElement  {                  Object obj =   JAXBElement  payload .getValue  ;                  CountRabbits obj_cr =  CountRabbits  obj;                  int n = obj_cr.getArg0  ;          current value                  if  n < 0  {                       negative argument?                     obj_cr.setArg0 Math.abs n  ;    make non-negative                         Update the message.                       JAXBElement  payload .setValue obj_cr ;                     msg.setPayload payload, jaxb_ctx ;                  }               }            }            catch JAXBException e  { }         }         return true;     }       public boolean handleFault LogicalMessageContext ctx  { return true; }         public void close MessageContext ctx  { } }        The ArgHandler uses a JAXBContext to extract the payload from the LogicalHandler. This payload is the body of the outgoing SOAP message. There is also a no-argument version of the LogicalHandler method getPayload, which returns an XML Source object. The XML from this source could be unmarshaled into a Java object. For the one-argument version of getPayload used here, the argument can be either a class or, as in this example, the  names  of  one  or  more  packages.   Recall  that  fibC  is  the  package  name  for  the wsimport-generated  artifacts.   In  any  case,  the  message’s  payload  is  extracted  as  a JAXBElement, which represents in XML a CountRabbits object, where CountRabbits is one of the wsimport-generated artifacts that supports the client code. In particular, the fibC.CountRabbits  class  is  the  Java  type  that  corresponds  to  a  SOAP  request  for the web service operation exposed as countRabbits. The CountRabbits class has two methods, getArg0 and setArg0, that give access to the argument passed to the countRabbits operation. If this argument is a negative integer, then the logical handler produces the nonnegative value with a call to Math.abs, updates  96  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   the JAXBElement to reflect this change, and finally updates the message body with a call to setPayload. This handler makes clients more robust by intercepting SOAP requests that otherwise would cause the service to throw a SOAP fault. The handler deployment file handler-chain.xml is updated to reflect a second handler in the chain. Here is the revised configuration file:    <javaee:handler-chains       xmlns:javaee="http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee"       xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema">          SOAP12_HTTP                fibC.UUIDHandler                     fibC.ArgHandler                     The ArgHandler is listed deliberately after the UUIDHandler to underscore that, whatever the  configuration  sequence,  the  handleMessage  or  handleFault  methods  in  a  logical handler always execute before the corresponding methods in a SOAP handler on out- going messages. For incoming messages, these SOAP handler methods execute before their logical handler counterparts. The RabbitCounter service still checks for negative arguments and throws a SOAP fault if there is one, as the service obviously cannot count on the client-side logical handler. Of course, the web service itself might convert negative arguments to nonnegative ones, but the current service design lets us explore how JWS handlers can be put to good use on the client side.  Adding a Service-Side SOAP Handler The client-side UUIDHandler inserts a header block with the actor attribute set to next. This setting means that any intermediary along the message path from sender to receiver should process the header block and, if appropriate, throw a fault. A fault is appropriate just in case the intermediary cannot process the header block in some way that the application requires. The SOAP specification does not explain the details of what pro- cessing an application may require of intermediaries and ultimate receivers; the speci- fication merely allows senders to signal that application-specific processing of header blocks is expected along the path to the receiver. In this messaging architecture, the ultimate receiver also counts as a next actor and is likewise expected to process the header block and throw a fault, if needed. To complete the example, then, we need a service-side SOAP handler to process the header block that the client-side application inserts into the outgoing SOAP message. The service-side handler illustrates how an intermediary  or  the  ultimate  receiver  might  process  the  header  block.  The  specific  SOAP: Hidden or Not?   97  Download at Boykma.Com   processing logic is less important than the processing itself. With client-side and service- side handlers in place, the sample application shows the basics of the JWS handler framework on the sender side and on the intermediary receiver side. The UUIDValidator  see Example 3-7  validates an incoming message on the service side. The validator needs access to the entire SOAP message rather than just its body; hence, the validator must be implemented as a SOAPMessageHandler rather than as a LogicalMessageHandler.  Example 3-7. A service-side handler for request validation  package ch03.fib;  import java.util.UUID; import java.util.Set; import java.util.Iterator; import java.util.Locale; import javax.xml.namespace.QName; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPMessage; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPConstants; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPHandler; import javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPMessageContext; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPEnvelope; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPHeader; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPBody; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPHeaderElement; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPException; import javax.xml.soap.Node; import javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPFaultException; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPFault; import java.io.IOException;  public class UUIDValidator implements SOAPHandler  {     private static final boolean trace = false;    make true to see message      public boolean handleMessage SOAPMessageContext ctx  {        Boolean response_p =  Boolean              ctx.get MessageContext.MESSAGE_OUTBOUND_PROPERTY ;            Handle the SOAP only if it's incoming.        if  !response_p  {           try {              SOAPMessage msg = ctx.getMessage  ;              SOAPEnvelope env = msg.getSOAPPart  .getEnvelope  ;              SOAPHeader hdr = env.getHeader  ;                  Ensure that the SOAP message has a header.              if  hdr == null                   generateSOAPFault msg, "No message header." ;                  Get UUID value from header block if it's there.              Iterator it =                  hdr.extractHeaderElements SOAPConstants.URI_SOAP_ACTOR_NEXT ;  98  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com                if  it == null  !it.hasNext                     generateSOAPFault msg, "No header block for next actor." ;              Node next =  Node  it.next  ;              String value =  next == null  ? null : next.getValue  ;              if  value == null                   generateSOAPFault msg, "No UUID in header block." ;                  Reconstruct a UUID object to check some properties.              UUID uuid = UUID.fromString value.trim   ;              if  uuid.variant   != UUIDvariant                   uuid.version   != UUIDversion                   generateSOAPFault msg, "Bad UUID variant or version." ;               if  trace  msg.writeTo System.out ;           }           catch SOAPException e  { System.err.println e ; }           catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; }        }         return true;    continue down the chain     }          public boolean handleFault SOAPMessageContext ctx  {         return true;     }     public Set  getHeaders   { return null; }          public void close MessageContext messageContext  { }      private void generateSOAPFault SOAPMessage msg, String reason  {        try {           SOAPBody body = msg.getSOAPPart  .getEnvelope  .getBody  ;           SOAPFault fault = body.addFault  ;           fault.setFaultString reason ;              wrapper for a SOAP 1.1 or SOAP 1.2 fault           throw new SOAPFaultException fault ;         }        catch SOAPException e  { }     }     private static final int UUIDvariant = 2;    layout     private static final int UUIDversion = 4;    version  }        First, the validator checks whether the incoming message even has a header and, if so, whether the header has the appropriate header block, in this case a header block marked in the SOAP role of next. Here is the code segment, without most of the comments, for the first validation check:  if  hdr == null     hdr refers to the SOAPHeader    generateSOAPFault msg, "No message header." ; Iterator it = hdr.extractHeaderElements SOAPConstants.URI_SOAP_ACTOR_NEXT ; if  it == null  !it.hasNext        generateSOAPFault msg, "No header block for next actor." ; Node next =  Node  it.next  ; String value =  next == null  ? null : next.getValue  ; if  value == null      generateSOAPFault msg, "No UUID in header block." ;     SOAP: Hidden or Not?   99  Download at Boykma.Com   If the first validation check succeeds, the validator then checks whether the UUID has the expected properties. In this example, the validator checks for the UUID version number, which should be 4, and the variant number, which should be 2.  The variant controls the format of the UUID value as a string.  Here is the code segment:  UUID uuid = UUID.fromString value.trim   ; if  uuid.variant   != UUIDvariant  uuid.version   != UUIDversion      generateSOAPFault msg, "Bad variant or version." ;        If any step in the validation fails, the validator throws a SOAPFaultException, which is a wrapper for SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 faults. This fault wrapper lets us ignore differ- ences between the two SOAP versions. Here is the code segment that generates the fault:  private void generateSOAPFault SOAPMessage msg, String reason  {     try {        SOAPBody body = msg.getSOAPPart  .getEnvelope  .getBody  ;        SOAPFault fault = body.addFault  ;        fault.setFaultString reason ;        throw new SOAPFaultException fault ;      }     catch SOAPException e  { } }        The UUIDValidator handler is annotated with @HandlerChain and deployed through a configuration  file.  Here  is  the  code  segment  that  shows  the  revision  to  the RabbitCounter SIB:  @HandlerChain file = "handler-chain.xml"  public class RabbitCounter {  The files handler-chain.xml and UUIDValidator.class reside in the ch03 fib subdirectory of the working directory. Various tests might be run against the validator. To begin, the line:  helem.addTextNode uuid.toString   ;        in fibC.UUIDValidator could be commented out so that the UUID value is not inserted into the header. In this case, the following fault message is generated and picked up by the handleFault method in the UUIDValidator handler:                    <ns2:Fault xmlns:ns2="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "                   xmlns:ns3="http:  www.w3.org 2003 05 soap-envelope">          ns2:Server           No UUID in header block.          ...          No UUID in header block.          ...                  100  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   The full fault message is large and includes a stack trace. A more subtle test is to provide a UUID that differs in the expected properties. For this test, the assignment to the uuid object reference in UUIDHandler on the client side can be changed from:  UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID  ;         to:  uuid = new UUID new java.util.Random  .nextLong  ,      lower 64 bits                 new java.util.Random  .nextLong   ;     upper 64 bits  The two-argument constructor generates a UUID with different properties than the randomUUID method does, a difference that the validator recognizes. With this change the fault message reads:  Bad UUID variant or version.        Summary of the Handler Methods The Handler interface declares three methods: handleMessage, handleFault, and close. The SOAPHandler extension of this interface adds one more declaration:  getHeaders, which returns a set of the QNames for SOAP header blocks. This method could be used, for  example,  to  insert  security  information  into  a  SOAP  header,  as  an  example  in Chapter 5 shows. In the current example, the method simply returns null. The other three methods have a MessageContext parameter that provides access to the underlying SOAP message. To illustrate the flow of control, here is the handler-chain.xml configuration file for the client-side handlers that execute when the FibClient is invoked:    <javaee:handler-chains       xmlns:javaee="http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee"       xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema">                  fibC.TestHandler                     fibC.UUIDHandler                     fibC.ArgHandler                     The  TestHandler  and  UUIDHandler  are  SOAPMessageHandlers  and  the  ArgHandler  is  a LogicalMessageHandler. Recall that, for outgoing messages such as requests from the FibClient, the logical handlers execute before the SOAP handlers. In this example, the order of execution is:  SOAP: Hidden or Not?   101  Download at Boykma.Com   1. The getHeaders method in the TestHandler and then in the UUIDHandler, both of  which are SOAP handlers, execute first.  2. The  handleMessage  in  the  logical  handler  ArgHandler  executes  first  among  the  methods with this name.  3. The handleMessage in the SOAP handler TestHandler executes next, as this handler  is listed first in the configuration file.  4. The handleMessage in the SOAP handler UUIDHandler executes next. 5. The close method in the SOAP handler UUIDHandler executes to signal that UUID  Handler processing is now done.  6. The close method in the SOAP handler TestHandler executes to signal that the  TestHandler processing is now done.  7. The close method in the logical handler ArgHandler executes, which completes the  chain on the outgoing message.  The JWS handler framework gives the programmer hooks into the message-processing pipeline so that incoming and outgoing messages can be intercepted and processed in an application-suitable way. The callback handleMessage is especially convenient, pro- viding access to either the entire SOAP message  in a SOAPMessageHandler  or to the payload of a SOAP message  in a LogicalMessageHandler .  The RabbitCounter As a SOAP 1.2 Service It takes just a few steps to transform the RabbitCounter from a SOAP 1.1 to a SOAP 1.2 service. The critical step is to add a @BindingType annotation to the SIB:  import javax.xml.ws.BindingType; @BindingType value = "http:  java.sun.com xml ns jaxws 2003 05 soap bindings HTTP "  public class RabbitCounter {   JWS does have a constant:  javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPBinding.SOAP12HTTP_BINDING      for the standard SOAP 1.2 binding, but the Endpoint publisher cannot generate a WSDL using the standard binding. The workaround is to use the nonstandard binding value shown above. When the service is published, Endpoint issues the nonfatal warning:  com.sun.xml.internal.ws.server.EndpointFactory generateWSDL WARNING: Generating non-standard WSDL for the specified binding      The wsgen utility is used in the same way as before, but the wsimport utility is now invoked with the -extension flag to indicate that the client stubs are generated from a nonstandard WSDL:  % wsimport -keep -extension -p fibC2 http:  localhost:8888 fib?wsdl  102  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   The UUIDValidator can be changed to exhibit a SOAP 1.2 feature, namely, use of the mustUnderstand attribute in a SOAP 1.2 header. Here is the change, immediately below the setActor call from the SOAP 1.1 version:  helem.setActor SOAPConstants.URI_SOAP_ACTOR_NEXT ; helem.setMustUnderstand true ;     SOAP 1.2      Here is the resulting request message, with the inserted header block in bold:              <uuid xmlns="http:  ch03.fib"             xmlns:env="http:  www.w3.org 2003 05 soap-envelope"             env:mustUnderstand="true"            env:role="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap actor next">         b50064b5-24e8-42bc-9716-10537c86bbd8                                    -45                  The mustUnderstand makes explicit that any intermediary node and the final receiver are expected to process the header block in an application-appropriate way. Even in SOAP 1.1, of course, such processing may occur, but SOAP 1.1 does not offer a way to make the expectation explicit. The  binding  section  in  the  Endpoint-generated  WSDL  reflects  the  change  from  the SOAP 1.1 to SOAP 1.2:      <soap12:binding transport="http:  www.w3.org 2003 05 soap bindings HTTP "                    style="document" >                                                                                                      Given the relatively minor differences between SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 and the status of SOAP 1.1 as the de facto standard, it makes sense to stick with SOAP 1.1 unless there is a compelling reason to use SOAP 1.2. Finally, SOAP 1.2 is backward compatible with SOAP 1.1.  The RabbitCounter As a SOAP 1.2 Service  103  Download at Boykma.Com   The MessageContext and Transport Headers This section considers how the JWS level of a service interacts with the transport level. The focus is on the MessageContext, which is normally accessed in handlers: the sub- types SOAPMessageContext and LogicalMessageMessageContext are the parameter types, for example, in the handleMessage callbacks of SOAP and logical handlers, respectively. The notion of context is a familiar one in modern programming systems, including Java. Servlets have a ServletContext, EJBs have an EJBContext  with appropriate subtypes such as SessionContext , and web services have a WebServiceContext. Seen in an archi- tectural light, a context is what gives an object  a servlet, an EJB, a web service  access to its underlying container  servlet container, EJB container, web service container .  Containers, in turn, provide the under-the-hood support for the object. Seen in a pro- gramming light, a context is a Map , that is, a key value collection in which the keys are strings and the values are arbitrary objects. It makes sense that the application level of a @WebService  that is, the SEI and the SIB  usually  take  the  underlying  MessageContext  for  granted,  treating  it  as  unseen  infra- structure. At the handler level, the MessageContext is appropriately exposed as the data type of callback parameters so that a SOAP or a logical handler can access the SOAP messages and their payloads, respectively. This section examines the more unusual situation in which the MessageContext is accessed outside of handlers; that is, in the application’s main components: the service implementation bean  SIB  and its clients. SOAP messages are delivered predominantly over HTTP. At issue, then, is how much of the HTTP infrastructure is exposed through the MessageContext in Java-based web services. What holds for HTTP also holds for alternative transports such as SMTP or even JMS. In a handler or SIB, Java provides access to HTTP messages in a MessageContext. In a Java-based client, Java likewise gives access to the HTTP level but in this case through the  BindingProvider  and  the  request response  contexts,  which  are  exposed  as BindingProvider properties. The code examples illustrate application-level as opposed to handler-level access to transport messages.  An Example to Illustrate Transport-Level Access The Echo service in Example 3-8 merely echoes a client’s text message back to the client. It is best to keep the service simple so that focus is on the transport layer. Throughout the example, the assumption is that transport is SOAP over HTTP.  Example 3-8. A service with access to the message context  package ch03.mctx;  import java.util.Map; import java.util.Set; import javax.annotation.Resource;  104  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod; import javax.xml.ws.WebServiceContext; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import javax.jws.HandlerChain;   **   * A minimalist service to explore the MessageContext.  * The operation takes a string and echoes it together   * with transport information back to the client.  *  @WebService @HandlerChain file = "handler-chain.xml"  public class Echo {        Enable 'dependency injection' on web service context     @Resource      WebServiceContext ws_ctx;      @WebMethod     public String echo String from_client  {        MessageContext ctx = ws_ctx.getMessageContext  ;        Map req_headers =  Map  ctx.get MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS ;        MapDump.dump_map  Map  ctx, "" ;        String response = "Echoing your message: " + from_client;        return response;     } }  The Echo class has a field named ws_ctx of type WebServiceContext, which is annotated with @Resource. This annotation is used to request dependency injection, a notion as- sociated with AOP  Aspect-Oriented Programming . As with any uninitialized field, ws_ctx has a default value of null. Yet, in the first line of the echo method, the method getMessageContext is invoked on the object to which ws_ctx now, as if by magic, refers. There is no magic, of course. The JWS container injects a WebServiceContext object into the application and makes ws_ctx refer to this object. The WebServiceContext then is used to access the MessageContext, which in turn is used to get a Map of the underlying transport  typically HTTP  headers. The dump_map method in the utility class MapDump:  package ch03.mctx;  import java.util.Map; import java.util.Set; public class MapDump {     public static void dump_map Map map, String indent  {        Set keys = map.keySet  ;        for  Object key : keys  {           System.out.println indent + key + " ==> " + map.get key  ;           if  map.get key  instanceof Map               dump_map  Map  map.get key , indent += "   " ;        }     } }  The MessageContext and Transport Headers   105  Download at Boykma.Com   is then invoked to dump the HTTP headers. Example 3-9 shows the relevant part of the dump from a sample client call against the Echo service.  Example 3-9. A dump of a sample HTTP message context  javax.xml.ws.wsdl.port ==> {http:  mctx.ch03 }EchoPort javax.xml.ws.soap.http.soapaction.uri ==> "echo" com.sun.xml.internal.ws.server.OneWayOperation ==> null javax.xml.ws.http.request.pathinfo ==> null com.sun.xml.internal.ws.api.message.packet.outbound.transport.headers ==>    com.sun.net.httpserver.Headers@0    com.sun.xml.internal.ws.client.handle ==> null    javax.xml.ws.wsdl.service ==> {http:  mctx.ch03 }EchoService    javax.xml.ws.reference.parameters ==> [ ]    javax.xml.ws.http.request.headers ==>        sun.net.httpserver.UnmodifiableHeaders@2c47bd03       Host ==> [localhost:9797]       Content-type ==> [text xml; charset=utf-8]       Accept-encoding ==> [gzip]       Content-length ==> [198]       Connection ==> [keep-alive]       Greeting ==> [Hello, world!]       User-agent ==> [Java 1.6.0_06]       Accept ==> [text xml, multipart related, text html, image gif,                   image jpeg, *; q=.2, * *; q=.2]       Soapaction ==> ["echo"]       ... javax.xml.ws.http.request.method ==> POST  Near the end in bold are the HTTP request headers from the client’s invocation of the echo operation. On the client side, the underlying libraries insert some standard key  value pairs into the HTTP headers; for instance, the pairs:  Host ==> [localhost:9797] Content-type ==> [text xml; charset=utf-8]        In standard HTTP, a colon separates the key from the value; in the Java rendering, the arrow ==> is used for clarity. In this example, two of the entries are from an Echo client:  Accept-encoding ==> [gzip] Greeting ==> [Hello, world!]        The first pair uses a standard HTTP key, Accept-encoding, with a value of gzip to signal that the client is willing to accept a gzip-compressed SOAP envelope as the body of the HTTP response. The second key value pair is whimsical: it uses the nonstandard key Greeting. HTTP 1.1, the current version, allows arbitrary key value pairs to be inserted into the HTTP header. Another entry in the HTTP header merits special attention:  Soapaction ==> ["echo"]        106  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   For a Java client, the default value for the Soapaction attribute would be the empty string. The string echo occurs here as the value because the client inserts this value into the header of the HTTP request. The JWS runtime processes the transport-layer headers that client or service code in- serts.  In  this  example,  the  EchoClient  shown  below  uses  the  key  Accept-Encoding  uppercase E in Encoding , which the JWS runtime changes to Accept-encoding  low- ercase e in encoding . Example 3-10 shows the sample client.  Example 3-10. A client that manipulates the message context  import java.util.Map; import java.util.Set; import java.util.List; import java.util.Collections; import java.util.HashMap; import javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import echoC.EchoService; import echoC.Echo;  class EchoClient {    public static void main String[ ] args  {       EchoService service = new EchoService  ;       Echo port = service.getEchoPort  ;        Map  req_ctx =   BindingProvider  port .getRequestContext  ;           Sample invocation:                    % java EchoClient http:  localhost:9797 echo                   1st command-line argument ends with service location port number          2nd command-line argument is the service operation       if  args.length >= 2  {              Endpoint address becomes: http:  localhost:9797 echo          req_ctx.put BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY,                           args[0] + " " + args[1] ;             SOAP action becomes: echo          req_ctx.put BindingProvider.SOAPACTION_URI_PROPERTY, args[1] ;       }          Add some application-specific HTTP headers       Map > my_header = new HashMap >  ;       my_header.put "Accept-Encoding", Collections.singletonList "gzip"  ;       my_header.put "Greeting", Collections.singletonList "Hello, world!"  ;           Insert customized headers into HTTP message headers       req_ctx.put MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS, my_header ;        dump_map req_ctx, "" ;       System.out.println "\n\nRequest above, response below\n\n" ;           Invoke service operation to generate an HTTP response.       String response = port.echo "Have a nice day : " ;  The MessageContext and Transport Headers   107  Download at Boykma.Com         Map  res_ctx =   BindingProvider  port .getResponseContext  ;       dump_map res_ctx, "" ;        Object response_code = res_ctx.get MessageContext.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE ;    }     private static void dump_map Map map, String indent  {       Set keys = map.keySet  ;       for  Object key : keys  {         System.out.println indent + key + " ==> " + map.get key  ;         if  map.get key  instanceof Map            dump_map  Map  map.get key , indent += "   " ;       }    } }  Here is the client invocation that resulted in the dump just shown:  % java EchoClient http:  localhost:9797  echo  The two command-line arguments are concatenated in the EchoClient application to generate  the  service’s  endpoint  location.  The  second  command-line  argument,  the name of the operation echo, also is inserted into the HTTP request header as the value of SOAPACTION_URI_PROPERTY. The  EchoClient  application  gains  access  to  the  HTTP  request  headers  through  the port  object  reference,  which  is  first  cast  to  a  BindingProvider  so  that  the  method getRequestContext can be invoked. This method returns a Map into which two entries are made: the first, as just noted, sets the SOAPACTION_URI_PROPERTY to the string echo; the second entry sets the ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY to the URL http:  localhost:9797  echo, thus illustrating how the service’s endpoint location could be set dynamically in a client application. The client also creates an empty map, with my_header as the reference, that accepts String keys and Object values. The Object values are of subtype List , instances of which the Collections utility method singletonList generates. The extra key value pairs are inserted into the HTTP request header. Although the service operation echo is invoked only once in the client, every invocation thereafter would result in an HTTP request with the augmented headers. Near the end of the EchoClient application, the port object reference is cast again to BindingProvider so that the method getResponseContext can be invoked to gain access to the HTTP response context, which is also a Map. The MessageContext class has various constants such as HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE, which are helpful in extracting information from the HTTP response headers. The Echo service includes the SOAP handler shown Example 3-11. It is noteworthy that the service, the sample client, and the SOAP handler all have access to the underlying message context, although the syntax for accessing this context differs slightly among the three.  108  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   Example 3-11. A service-side handler with access to the message context  package ch03.mctx;  import java.util.Map; import java.util.Set; import java.util.Locale; import javax.xml.namespace.QName; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPHandler; import javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPMessageContext;  public class EchoHandler implements SOAPHandler  {     public boolean handleMessage SOAPMessageContext ctx  {           Is this an inbound message, i.e., a request?        Boolean response_p =  Boolean             ctx.get MessageContext.MESSAGE_OUTBOUND_PROPERTY ;            Manipulate the SOAP only if it's incoming.        if  !response_p  MapDump.dump_map  Map  ctx, "" ;        return true;    continue down the chain     }     public boolean handleFault SOAPMessageContext ctx  { return true; }     public Set  getHeaders   { return null; }          public void close MessageContext messageContext  { } }  Later examples return to the theme of application-level access to the transport level, in particular to HTTP or equivalent message headers. For example, HTTP headers are one place to store credentials in a service that requires authentication from its clients.  Web Services and Binary Data In the examples so far, the underlying SOAP messages contain text that is converted, as needed, to service-appropriate types. The type conversion is mostly automatic, oc- curring in the JWS infrastructure without application intervention. For instance, here is the body of a SOAP request message to the countRabbits operation. The argument 45 occurs as text in the message:                45              but is converted automatically to an int so that the service method countRabbits:  @WebMethod public int countRabbits int n  throws FibException {  can compute and return the Fibonacci number for integer argument  n. Neither the FibClient application nor the RabbitCounter service does any explicit type conversion.  Web Services and Binary Data  109  Download at Boykma.Com   By contrast, some explicit type conversions occur at the handler level. For instance, the UUIDHandler on the client side and the UUIDValidator on the service side do explicit, if simple, type conversions. The UUIDHandler converts the UUID object to a string:  helem.addTextNode uuid.toString   ;      and the UUIDValidator does the opposite conversion:  UUID uuid = UUID.fromString value.trim   ;      The client-side ArgHandler does the most work with respect to type conversion. This logical handler uses JAX-B in this code segment:  JAXBContext jaxb_ctx = JAXBContext.newInstance "fibC" ; Object payload = msg.getPayload jaxb_ctx ; if  payload instanceof JAXBElement  {    Object obj =   JAXBElement  payload .getValue  ;    CountRabbits obj_cr =  CountRabbits  obj;    int n = obj_cr.getArg0  ;          current value    if  n < 0  {                       negative argument?       obj_cr.setArg0 Math.abs n  ;    make non-negative           Update the message.         JAXBElement  payload .setValue obj_cr ;       msg.setPayload payload, jaxb_ctx ;    } }      to obtain a CountRabbits object from an XML element; invokes the getArg0 method and possibly the setArg0 method on the object to ensure that the argument passed to the  countRabbits  operation  is  nonnegative;  and  then,  with  the  call  to  setPayload, changes the CountRabbits object back to an XML element. Type conversions come to the forefront in the issue of how binary data such as images, movies, and the like can be arguments passed to or values returned from web service operations. SOAP-based web services are not limited to text, but their use of binary data raises important efficiency issues. There are two general approaches to handling arbitrary binary data in SOAP-based web services:    The binary data can be encoded using a scheme such as base64 and then trans- mitted as the payload of the SOAP body. For instance, a service operation that returns an image to a requester simply could return a java.awt.Image, which is a Java wrapper for image bytes. The image’s bytes then would be encoded and trans- mitted as the body of a SOAP message. The downside is that base64 and similar encoding schemes result in payloads that are at least a third larger in size than the original, unencoded binary data. In short, byte encoding such as base64 results in data bloat.    The binary data can be transmitted as one or more attachments to a SOAP message. Recall that a SOAP message consists of a SOAP part, which is the SOAP envelope  110  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   with an optional header and a possibly empty body. A SOAP message also may have attachments, which can carry data of any MIME type, including multimedia types  such  as  audio x-wav,  video mpeg,  and  image jpeg.  JAX-B  provides  the  re- quired mappings between MIME and Java types: the MIME types image * map to Image, and the remaining multimedia types map to DataHandler.  The attachments option is preferable because it avoids data bloat—raw rather than encoded bytes go from sender to receiver. The downside is that the receiver then must deal with the raw bytes, for example, by converting them back into multimedia types such as images and sounds.  Three Options for SOAP Attachments There  are  basically  three  options  for  SOAP  attachments:  SwA   SOAP  with  Attach- ments ,  the  original  SOAP  specification  for  attachments;  DIME   Direct  Internet Message Encapsulation , a lightweight but by now old-fashioned encoding scheme for attachments; and MTOM  Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism , which is based on XOP  XML-Binary Optimized Packaging . JWS has a DIME extension whose main purpose is to interoperate with Microsoft clients. Up until the release of Microsoft Office 2003, a web service client written in Visual Basic for Applications  VBA  could handle only DIME rather than MTOM attachments. The SwA approach has draw- backs. For one, it is hard to use SwA with a document-style service, which is now the norm. Further, frameworks such as DotNet do not support SwA. MTOM has the W3C stamp  of  approval  and  enjoys  widespread  support;  hence,  MTOM  is  the  efficient, modern, interoperable way to transmit binary data in SOAP-based web services. Before considering MTOM, let’s take a quick look at base64 encoding of binary data, which might be used for small binary payloads.  Using Base64 Encoding for Binary Data The SkiImageService in Example 3-12 has two operations: getImage returns a named image of a skier and getImages returns a list of the available images. Example 3-12 shows the source code.  Example 3-12.

The images are stored in a subdirectory of the working directory. The two service operations, getImage and getImages, are un- complicated. The getImage operation returns a java.awt.Image, and the getImages op- eration returns a List . Of interest here is that the return types are high level rather than byte arrays. A quick look at the binding section of the WSDL:      <soap:binding transport="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap http"                  style="document">                                                                                                              Web Services and Binary Data  113  Download at Boykma.Com                                     shows that the service is document style with literal encoding. Two segments from the associated XSD provide more information:           <xs:element name="return" type="xs:base64Binary"                  minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">                               The XSD indicates that the style is indeed wrapped document, with getImageResponse as  one  of  the  wrapper  types.  The  XSD  type  for  this  wrapper  is  the  expected base64Binary. Here is the truncated SOAP response envelope from a request for one of the skiing images:                        iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAZAAAAEsCAIAAABi1X...                 The entire image or list of images is returned as a base64 character encoding in the body of the SOAP envelope. The SkiImageClient is shown here:  import skiC.SkiImageService_Service; import skiC.SkiImageService; import java.util.List; class SkiImageClient {     public static void main String[ ] args  {           wsimport-generated artifacts        SkiImageService_Service service = new SkiImageService_Service  ;        SkiImageService port = service.getSkiImageServicePort  ;           Note the return types: byte[ ] and List         byte[ ] image = port.getImage "nordic" ;        List  images = port.getImages  ;         * Transform the received bytes in some useful way :  *      } }  114  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   This client uses wsimport-generated stubs to invoke the service operations. However, the client gets either an array of bytes or a list of these as return values because the XSD type base64Binary maps to the Java type byte[]. The client receives the base64 encoding of images as byte arrays and then must transform these encodings back into images. This is inconvenient, to say the least. The fix is to edit the WSDL so that the service is friendlier to clients. After saving the WSDL  and  its  XSD  to  local  files   for  instance,  ski.wsdl  and  ski.xsd ,  the  following changes should be made:  1. Edit the XSD document. In particular, make the two additions shown in bold:            <xs:element name="return" type="xs:base64Binary"                  minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"                 xmime:expectedContentTypes="image jpeg"                   xmlns:xmime="http:  www.w3.org 2005 05 xmlmime">                        <xs:element name="return" type="xs:base64Binary"                  minOccurs="0"                 xmime:expectedContentTypes="image jpeg"                    xmlns:xmime="http:  www.w3.org 2005 05 xmlmime">                    The attribute expectedContentTypes is set to the MIME type image jpeg so that the wsimport utility can generate versions of the operations getImage and getImages that return the Java types Image and List , respectively.  2. In the SkiImageService, the @WebService annotation should be changed to:  @WebService serviceName = "SkiImageService",             wsdlLocation = "ch03 image ski.wsdl"     to reflect the new location of the WSDL.  3. The WSDL should then be changed to reflect the new location of XSD document:            <xsd:import namespace="http:  image.ch03 "                  schemaLocation="ski.xsd">                       4. From the working directory  in this case, the parent of the subdirectory ch03 , the  wsimport utility is run to generate the new artifacts:  Web Services and Binary Data  115  Download at Boykma.Com   % wsimport -keep -p skiC2 ch03 image ski.wsdl          With  these  changes,  the  client  now  can  work  with  the  Java  types  Image  and List  instead of the bytes from the base64 encoding of images. Here is the revised client:  import skiC2.SkiImageService_Service; import skiC2.SkiImageService; import java.awt.Image; import java.util.List;  class SkiImageClient2 {     public static void main String[ ] args  {        SkiImageService_Service service = new SkiImageService_Service  ;        SkiImageService port = service.getSkiImageServicePort  ;         Image image = port.getImage "telemk" ;        List  images = port.getImages  ;         * Process the images in some appropriate way. *      } }  The revised SkiImageService and the corresponding wsimport-generated artifacts let clients receive high-level types such as the java.awt.Image instead of arrays of raw bytes. These revisions do not remedy the data bloat of base64 encoding, however. The next subsection gives an example that avoids base64 encoding altogether by working with raw rather than encoded bytes.  Using MTOM for Binary Data This  section  adapts  the  SkiImageService  to  use  MTOM.  Several  things  need  to  be changed, but each change is relatively minor. In the XSD, the expectedContentTypes attribute occurs twice. The changes are in bold:            <xs:element name="return" type="xs:base64Binary"               minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"               xmime:expectedContentTypes="application octet-stream"                 xmlns:xmime="http:  www.w3.org 2005 05 xmlmime">                        <xs:element name="return" type="xs:base64Binary"                 minOccurs="0"                 xmime:expectedContentTypes="application octet-stream"                   xmlns:xmime="http:  www.w3.org 2005 05 xmlmime">                  116  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   The MIME subtype name  application octet-stream captures the optimization that recommends MTOM—the image bytes will be streamed unencoded to the service cli- ent. The bloat of base64 or comparable encoding is thereby avoided. For emphasis, the SkiImageService is annotated to show that MTOM may come into play:  import javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPBinding; @WebService serviceName = "SkiImageService"     This binding value is enabled by default but put here for emphasis. @BindingType value = SOAPBinding.SOAP11HTTP_MTOM_BINDING  @HandlerChain file = "handler-chain.xml"     for message tracking public class SkiImageService {  The binding value is the default, hence optional, but it is included for emphasis. The next change is important. Here is the revised publisher, with the work now divided among several methods for clarity:  package ch03.image;  import javax.xml.ws.Endpoint; import javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPBinding; public class SkiImagePublisher {     private Endpoint endpoint;      public static void main String[ ] args  {         SkiImagePublisher me = new SkiImagePublisher  ;         me.create_endpoint  ;         me.configure_endpoint  ;         me.publish  ;     }      private void create_endpoint   {         endpoint = Endpoint.create new SkiImageService   ;     }      private void configure_endpoint   {         SOAPBinding binding =  SOAPBinding  endpoint.getBinding  ;         binding.setMTOMEnabled true ;     }      private void publish   {         int port = 9999;         String url = "http:  localhost:" + port + " ski";         endpoint.publish url ;         System.out.println url ;     } }  The service endpoint enables MTOM for responses to the client. Although the service still uses a SOAP handler to dump the response message, this dump is misleading be- cause it shows the images as base64-encoded values in the SOAP body. The MTOM  Web Services and Binary Data  117  Download at Boykma.Com   optimization occurs after the handler executes; hence, a utility such as tcpdump offers a better picture of what is really going on. The last change is to the sample client, now SkiImageClient3, after the wsimport utility has been run yet again to generate the artifacts in directory skiC3:  import skiC3.SkiImageService_Service; import skiC3.SkiImageService; import javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider; import javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPBinding; import java.util.List; import java.io.IOException; import javax.activation.DataHandler;  class SkiImageClient3 {     public static void main String[ ] args  {        SkiImageService_Service service = new SkiImageService_Service  ;        SkiImageService port = service.getSkiImageServicePort  ;         DataHandler image = port.getImage "nordic" ;        List  images = port.getImages  ;        dump image ;        for  DataHandler hd : images            dump hd ;     }     private static void dump DataHandler dh  {        System.out.println  ;        try {           System.out.println "MIME type: " + dh.getContentType   ;           System.out.println "Content:   " + dh.getContent   ;        }        catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; }     } }  The service operations now return a DataHandler or a List of these. This change is reflected in the JAX-B artifacts created with the wsimport utility. For instance, here is a segment from the GetImageResponse artifact with an @XmlMimeType annotation that reflects  the  service’s  revised  XSD  and  also  indicates  that  the  service  now  returns  a DataHandler:  @XmlElement name = "return"  @XmlMimeType "application octet-stream"  protected DataHandler _return;  It is now up to the client to reconstruct the appropriate objects from the optimized byte stream sent from the service. The tradeoff is clear: MTOM optimizes the transmission by avoiding data bloat, but the message receiver is forced to deal with raw bytes. Here is the output from the dump method on a sample run:  MIME type: application octet-stream Content:   java.io.ByteArrayInputStream@210b5b  118  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   MIME type: application octet-stream Content:   java.io.ByteArrayInputStream@170888e  MIME type: application octet-stream Content:   java.io.ByteArrayInputStream@11563ff ...        The input streams provide access to the underlying bytes from which the Image instan- ces can be restored. The service’s createImage method could be used on the client side for this purpose. If the client needed to send large amounts of binary data to the web service, then the client, too, could enable MTOM. This revised SkiImageClient2 shows how by using the Binding method setMTOMEnable:  SkiImageService port = service.getSkiImageServicePort  ;     Enable MTOM for client transmissions BindingProvider bp =  BindingProvider  port; SOAPBinding binding =  SOAPBinding  bp.getBinding  ; binding.setMTOMEnabled true ;   MTOM does come at a cost, which the receiver pays by having to deal with the raw bytes available through a returned DataHandler’s input stream. Yet the gains in effi- ciency for large data sets may easily offset this cost. As the example shows, enabling MTOM is relatively straightforward on the service side and on the client side.  What’s Next? There is much to like about SOAP-based web services in general and @WebServices in particular. Such services are built upon industry-standard, vendor-independent proto- cols such as HTTP, XML, and SOAP itself. These services represent a language-neutral approach to building and deploying distributed software systems. The WSDL and as- sociated tools such as Java’s wsimport ease the task of writing service clients and even services themselves in some preferred language. SOAP as a language-agnostic messag- ing system and XML Schema as a language-neutral type system promote service inter- operability and API standardization. Yet SOAP-based services are complicated, especially if the developer has to drill down into the infrastructure for any reason whatsoever. Even at the application level, the APIs for  SOAP-based  web  services  have  become  quite  rich.  There  are  various  standards bodies involved in SOAP and SOAP-based web services, including the W3C, OASIS  Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Services , IETF  Inter- national Engineering Task Force , and WS-I  Web Services Interoperability Organiza- tion . There are specification initiatives in areas as broad and varied as interoperability, business process, presentation, security, metadata, reliability, resources, messaging, XML,  management,  transactions,  and  SOAP  itself.  Each  area  has  subareas.  For  What’s Next?   119  Download at Boykma.Com   instance, the security area has 10 subareas, the interoperability area likewise has 10 subareas, the metadata area has 9 subareas, and the messaging area also has 9 subareas. It is not uncommon to hear complaints about how SOAP and SOAP-based web services have been over-engineered. The JAX-WS framework reflects this complexity with its wealth of annotations and tools. This complexity explains, at least in part, the current popularity of REST-style or RESTful approaches to web services. The next chapter focuses on RESTful Web services.  120  Chapter 3: SOAP Handling  Download at Boykma.Com   CHAPTER 4 RESTful Web Services  What Is REST? Roy Fielding  http:  roy.gbiv.com  coined the acronym REST in his Ph.D. dissertation. Chapter 5 of his dissertation lays out the guiding principles for what have come to be known as REST-style or RESTful web services. Fielding has an impressive resume. He is, among other things, a principal author of the HTTP specification and a cofounder of the Apache Software Foundation. REST and SOAP are quite different. SOAP is a messaging protocol, whereas REST is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems; that is, systems in which text, graphics, audio, and other media are stored across a network and inter- connected through hyperlinks. The World Wide Web is the obvious example of such a system. As our focus is web services, the World Wide Web is the distributed hyper- media system of interest. In the Web, HTTP is both a transport protocol and a mes- saging system because HTTP requests and responses are messages. The payloads of HTTP messages can be typed using the MIME type system, and HTTP provides re- sponse status codes to inform the requester about whether a request succeeded and, if not, why. REST stands for REpresentation State Transfer, which requires clarification because the central abstraction in REST—the resource—does not occur in the acronym. A re- source  in  the  RESTful  sense  is  anything  that  has  an  URI;  that  is,  an  identifier  that satisfies formatting requirements. The formatting requirements are what make URIs uniform. Recall, too, that URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier; hence, the no- tions of URI and resource are intertwined. In practice, a resource is an informational item that has hyperlinks to it. Hyperlinks use URIs to do the linking. Examples of resources are plentiful but likewise misleading in suggesting that resources must have something in common other than identifiability through URIs. The gross national product of Lithuania in 2001 is a resource, as is the Modern Jazz Quartet. Ernie Bank’s baseball accomplishments count as a resource, as does the maximum flow algorithm. The concept of a resource is remarkably broad but, at the same time, impressively simple and precise.  121  Download at Boykma.Com   As Web-based informational items, resources are pointless unless they have at least one representation. In the Web, representations are MIME-typed. The most common type of resource representation is probably still text html, but nowadays resources tend to have multiple representations. For example, there are various interlinked HTML pages that represent the Modern Jazz Quartet, but there are also audio and audiovisual rep- resentations of this resource. Resources have state. For example, Ernie Bank’s baseball accomplishments changed during his career with the Chicago Cubs from 1953 through 1971 and culminated in his 1977 induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. A useful representation must capture a resource’s state. For example, the current HTML pages on Ernie at the Baseball Ref- erence website  http:  www.baseball-reference.com  need to represent all of his major league accomplishments, from his rookie year in 1953 through his induction into the Hall of Fame. In a RESTful request targeted at a resource, the resource itself remains on the service machine. The requester typically receives a representation of the resource if the request succeeds. It is the representation that transfers from the service machine to the requester machine. In different terms, a RESTful client issues a request that involves a resource, for instance, a request to read the resource. If this read request succeeds, a typed rep- resentation  for instance, text html  of the resource is transferred from the server that hosts the resource to the client that issued the request. The representation is a good one only if it captures the resource’s state in some appropriate way. In  summary,  RESTful  web  services  require  not  just  resources  to  represent  but  also client-invoked operations on such resources. At the core of the RESTful approach is the insight that HTTP, despite the occurrence of Transport in its name, is an API and not simply a transport protocol. HTTP has its well-known verbs, officially known as methods. Table 4-1 shows the HTTP verbs that correspond to the CRUD  Create, Read, Update, Delete  operations so familiar throughout computing.  Table 4-1. HTTP verbs and CRUD operations  HTTP verb POST GET PUT DELETE  Meaning in CRUD terms Create a new resource from the request data Read a resource Update a resource from the request data Delete a resource  Although  HTTP  is  not  case-sensitive,  the  HTTP  verbs  are  traditionally  written  in uppercase. There are additional verbs. For example, the verb HEAD is a variation on GET that requests only the HTTP headers that would be sent to fulfill a GET request. There are also TRACE and INFO verbs. Figure 4-1 is a whimsical depiction of a resource with its identifying URI, together with a RESTful client and some typed representations sent as responses to HTTP requests  122  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   for the resource. Each HTTP request includes a verb to indicate which CRUD operation should  be  performed  on  the  resource.  A  good  representation  is  precisely  one  that matches the requested operation and captures the resource’s state in some appropriate way. For example, in this depiction a GET request could return my biography as a hacker as either an HTML document or a short video summary. The video would fail to capture the state of the resource if it depicted, say, only the major disasters in my brother’s career rather than those in my own. A typical HTML representation of the resource would include hyperlinks to other resources, which in turn could be the target of HTTP requests with the appropriate CRUD verbs.  Figure 4-1. A small slice of a RESTful system  HTTP also has standard response codes, such as 404 to signal that the requested re- source could not be found, and 200 to signal that the request was handled successfully. In short, HTTP provides request verbs and MIME types for client requests and status codes  and MIME types  for service responses. Modern browsers generate only GET and POST requests. Moreover, many applications treat these two types of requests interchangeably. For example, Java HttpServlets have callback methods such as doGet and doPost that handle GET and POST requests, re- spectively. Each callback has the same parameter types, HttpServletRequest  the key  value pairs from the requester  and HttpServletResponse  a typed response to the re- quester . It is common to have the two callbacks execute the same code  for instance, by having one invoke the other , thereby conflating the original HTTP distinction be- tween read and create. A key guiding principle of the RESTful style is to respect the original meanings of the HTTP verbs. In particular, any GET request should be side effect-free  or, in jargon,  idempotent  because a GET is a  read rather than a  create, update, or delete operation. A GET as a read with no side effects is called a safe GET. The REST approach does not imply that either resources or the processing needed to generate adequate representations of them are simple. A REST-style web service might be every bit as subtle and complicated as a SOAP-based service. The RESTful approach  What Is REST?   123  Identifying URL:  http:  my.life.job hacker  Resource:  My life as a hacker  HTTP requests    GET:  Read    POST:  Create    PUT:  Update    DELETE:  Delete  HTTP responses    MIME-typed representations of the resource such as:    GET:  HTML page with my hacker’s bio    GET:  Short video of major disasters    PUT:  Plain text acknowledgement of update    POST:  Fancy HTML acknowledgement of resource creation  RESTful client  Download at Boykma.Com   tries to simplify matters by taking what HTTP, with its MIME type system, already offers: built-in CRUD operations, uniformly identifiable resources, and typed repre- sentations that can capture a resource’s state. REST as a design philosophy tries to isolate application complexity at the endpoints, that is, at the client and at the service. A service may require lots of logic and computation to maintain resources and to gen- erate adequate representation of resources—for instance, large and subtly formatted XML documents—and a client may require significant XML processing to extract the desired information from the XML representations transferred from the service to the client. Yet the RESTful approach keeps the complexity out of the transport level, as a resource representation is transferred to the client as the body of an HTTP response message. By contrast, a SOAP-based service inevitably complicates the transport level because a SOAP message is encapsulated as the body of a transport message; for in- stance, an HTTP or SMTP message. SOAP requires messages within messages, whereas REST does not.*  Verbs and Opaque Nouns A URI is meant to be opaque, which means that the URI:  http:  bedrock citizens fred  has no inherent connection to the URI:  http:  bedrock citizens  although Fred happens to be a citizen of Bedrock. These are simply two different, in- dependent identifiers. Of course, a good URI designer will come up with URIs that are suggestive about what they are meant to identify. The point is that URIs have no in- trinsic hierarchical structure. URIs can and should be interpreted, but these interpre- tations are imposed on URIs, not inherent in them. Although URI syntax looks like the syntax used to navigate a hierarchical file system, this resemblance is misleading. A URI is an opaque identifier, a logically proper name that denotes exactly one resource. In RESTful services, then, URIs act as identifying nouns and HTTP methods act as verbs that specify operations on the resources identified by these nouns. For reference, here is the HTTP start line from a client’s request against the TimeServer service in Chapter 1:  POST http:  127.0.0.1:9876 ts HTTP  1.1        The HTTP verb comes first, then the URI, and finally the requester’s version of HTTP. This URI is, of course, a URL that locates the web service. Table 4-2 uses simplified URIs to summarize the intended meanings of HTTP URI combinations.  * For a thorough coverage of REST-style web services, see Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby’s book RESTful  Web Services  O’Reilly .  124  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   Table 4-2. Sample HTTP verb URI pairs  HTTP verb URI POST emps GET emps GET emps?id=27 PUT emps DELETE emps DELETE emps?id=27  Intended CRUD meaning Create a new employee from the request data Read a list of all employees Read a singleton list of employee 27 Update the employee list with the request data Delete the employee list Delete employee 27  These verb URI pairs are terse, precise, and uniform in style. The pairs illustrate that RESTful conventions can yield simple, clear expressions about which operation should be performed on which resource. The POST and PUT verbs are used in requests that have an HTTP body; hence, the request data are housed in the HTTP message body. The GET and DELETE verbs are used in requests that have no body; hence, the request data are sent as query string entries. For the record, RESTful web services are Turing complete; that is, these services are equal in power to any computational system, including a system that consists of SOAP- based web services. Yet the decision about whether to be RESTful in a particular ap- plication depends, as always, on practical matters. This first section has looked at REST from on high; it is now time to descend into details through examples.  From @WebService to @WebServiceProvider The @WebService annotation signals that the messages exchanged between the service and its clients will be SOAP envelopes. The @WebServiceProvider signals that the ex- changed  messages  will  be  XML  documents  of  some  type,  a  notion  captured  in  the phrase raw XML. Of course, a @WebServiceProvider could process and generate SOAP on its own, but this approach is not recommended.  A later example illustrates, how- ever.  The obvious way to provide a SOAP-based web service is to use the annotation @WebService. In a RESTful request response service, the service response is raw XML but the in- coming request might not be XML at all. A GET request does not have a body; hence, arguments sent as part of the request occur as attributes in the query string, a collection of key value pairs. Here is a sample:  http:  www.onlineparlor.com bets?horse=bigbrown&jockey=kent&amount=25  The question mark  ?  begins the query string, and the attributes are key value pairs separated by ampersands  & . The order of attributes in the query string is arbitrary; for instance, the jockey attribute could occur first in the query string without changing the meaning of the request. By contrast, a POST request does have a body, which can be an arbitrary XML document instead of a SOAP envelope.  From @WebService to @WebServiceProvider   125  Download at Boykma.Com   A  service  annotated  with  @WebServiceProvider  implements  the  Provider  interface, which requires that the invoke method: public Source invoke Source request   be defined. This method expects a Source of bytes  for instance, the bytes in an XML document that represents the service request  and returns a Source of bytes  the bytes in the XML response . When a request arrives, the infrastructure dispatches the request to the invoke method, which handles the request in some service-appropriate way. These points can be illustrated with an example.  A RESTful Version of the Teams Service The first RESTful service revises the Teams SOAP-based service from Chapter 1. The teams in question are comedy groups such as the Marx Brothers. To begin, the RESTful service honors only GET requests, but the service will be expanded to support the other HTTP verbs associated with the standard CRUD operations.  The WebServiceProvider Annotation Example 4-1 is the source code for the initial version of the RestfulTeams service.  Example 4-1.

The service implements the generic Provider     interface rather than a customized SEI with designated @WebMethods. @WebServiceProvider     There are two ServiceModes: PAYLOAD, the default, signals that the service    wants access only to the underlying message payload  e.g., the    body of an HTTP POST request ; MESSAGE signals that the service wants    access to entire message  e.g., the HTTP headers and body .  @ServiceMode value = javax.xml.ws.Service.Mode.MESSAGE      The HTTP_BINDING as opposed, for instance, to a SOAP binding. @BindingType value = HTTPBinding.HTTP_BINDING  public class RestfulTeams implements Provider  {     @Resource     protected WebServiceContext ws_ctx;      private Map  team_map;    for easy lookups     private List  teams;              serialized deserialized     private byte[ ] team_bytes;            from the persistence file      private static final String file_name = "teams.ser";      public RestfulTeams   {         read_teams_from_file  ;    read the raw bytes from teams.ser         deserialize  ;             deserialize to a List      }         This method handles incoming requests and generates the response.     public Source invoke Source request  {         if  ws_ctx == null  throw new RuntimeException "DI failed on ws_ctx." ;             Grab the message context and extract the request verb.

The main annotation is now @WebServiceProvider instead of @WebService. In the next two annotations:  @ServiceMode value = javax.xml.ws.Service.Mode.MESSAGE  @BindingType value = HTTPBinding.HTTP_BINDING         the @ServiceMode annotation overrides the default value of PAYLOAD in favor of the value MESSAGE. This annotation is included only to highlight it, as the RestfulTeams service would work just as well with the default value. The second annotation announces that the service deals with raw XML over HTTP instead of SOAP over HTTP. The RESTful revision deals with raw XML rather than with SOAP. The comedy teams are now stored on the local disk, in a file named teams.ser, as an XML document gen- erated using the XMLEncoder class. Here is a segment of the file:                              BurnsAndAllen                                                          George Burns                                George                                   ...    An XMLDecoder is used to deserialize this stored XML document into a List . For convenience, the service also has a Map  so that individual teams can be accessed by name. Here is the code segment:  private void deserialize   {         Deserialize the bytes into a list of teams      XMLDecoder dec = new XMLDecoder new ByteArrayInputStream team_bytes  ;      teams =  List   dec.readObject  ;          Create a map for quick lookups of teams.      team_map = Collections.synchronizedMap new HashMap    ;      for  Team team : teams  team_map.put team.getName  , team ; }  A RESTful Version of the Teams Service  129  Download at Boykma.Com   The RestfulTeams service is published using the by-now-familiar Endpoint publisher, the same publisher used for SOAP-based services under JWS:  package ch04.team;  import javax.xml.ws.Endpoint;  class TeamsPublisher {     public static void main String[ ] args  {         int port = 8888;         String url = "http:  localhost:" + port + " teams";         System.out.println "Publishing Teams restfully on port " + port ;         Endpoint.publish url, new RestfulTeams   ;     } }       Of the four HTTP verbs that correspond to CRUD operations, only GET has no side effects on the resource, which is the list of classic comedy teams. For now, then, there is no need to serialize a changed List  to the file teams.ser. The JWS runtime dispatches client requests against the  RestfulTeams service to the invoke method:  public Source invoke Source request  {     if  ws_ctx == null  throw new RuntimeException "Injection failed on ws_ctx." ;         Grab the message context and extract the request verb.     MessageContext msg_ctx = ws_ctx.getMessageContext  ;     String http_verb =  String  msg_ctx.get MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD ;     http_verb = http_verb.trim  .toUpperCase  ;         Act on the verb. For now, only GET requests accepted.     if  http_verb.equals "GET"   return doGet msg_ctx ;      else throw new HTTPException 405 ;    method not allowed }         This method extracts the HTTP request verb from the MessageContext and then invokes a verb-appropriate method such as doGet to handle the request. If the request verb is not GET, then an HTTPException is thrown with the status code 405 to signal method not allowed. Table 4-3 shows some of the many HTTP status codes.  Table 4-3. Sample HTTP status codes  HTTP status code 200 400 403 404 405 415 500  Official reason OK Bad request Forbidden Not found Method not allowed Unsupported media type Internal server error  Meaning Request OK. Request malformed. Request refused. Resource not found. Method not supported. Content type not recognized. Request processing failed.  130  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   In general, status codes in the range of 100–199 are informational; those in the range of 200–299 are success codes; codes in the range of 300–399 are for redirection; those in the range of 400–499 signal client errors; and codes in the range of 500–599 indicate server errors. There are two types of GET  and, later, DELETE  requests handled in the service. If the GET request comes without a query string, the RestfulTeams service treats this as a request for the entire list of teams and responds with a copy of the XML document in  the  file  teams.ser.  If  the  GET  request  has  a  query  string,  this  should  be  in  the form  ?name= ,  for  instance,  ?name=MarxBrothers.  In  this  case,  the  doGet method gets the named team and encodes this team as an XML document using the XMLEncoder in the method encode_to_stream. Here is the body of the doGet method:  if  query_string == null     get all teams         Respond with list of all teams      return new StreamSource new ByteArrayInputStream team_bytes  ; else {    get the named team      String name = get_name_from_qs query_string ;          Check if named team exists.      Team team = team_map.get name ;      if  team == null  throw new HTTPException 404 ;    not found          Respond with named team.      ByteArrayInputStream stream = encode_to_stream team ;      return new StreamSource stream ; }        The StreamSource is a source of bytes that come from the XML document and are made available to the requesting client. On a request for the Marx Brothers, the doGet method returns, as a byte stream, an XML document that begins:              MarxBrothers                                            Leonard Marx                          Chico        ...  A RESTful Version of the Teams Service  131  Download at Boykma.Com   Language Transparency and RESTful Services As evidence of language transparency, the first client against the RestfulTeams service is not in Java but rather in Perl. The client sends two GET requests and performs ele- mentary processing on the responses. Here is the initial Perl client:  ! usr bin perl  use strict; use LWP; use XML::XPath;   Create the user agent. my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;  my $base_uri = 'http:  localhost:8888 teams';   GET teams?name=MarxBrothers my $request = $base_uri . '?name=MarxBrothers'; send_GET $request ;  sub send_GET {     my  $uri, $qs_flag  = @_;       Send the request and get the response.     my $req = HTTP::Request->new GET => $uri ;     my $res = $ua->request $req ;       Check for errors.     if  $res->is_success  {         parse_GET $res->content, $qs_flag ;  Process raw XML on success     }     else {         print $res->status_line, "\n";       Print error code on failure     } }   Print raw XML and the elements of interest. sub parse_GET {     my  $raw_xml  = @_;     print "\nThe raw XML response is:\n$raw_xml\n;;;\n";       For all teams, extract and print out their names and members     my $xp = XML::XPath->new xml => $raw_xml ;     foreach my $node  $xp->find '  object void string' ->get_nodelist  {         print $node->string_value, "\n";     } }  The Perl client issues a GET request against the URI http:  localhost:8888 teams, which is the endpoint location for the Endpoint-published service. If the request succeeds, the service returns an XML representation of the teams, in this case the XML generated from a call to the XMLEncoder method writeObject. The Perl client prints the raw XML and  performs  a  very  simple  parse,  using  an  XPath  package  to  get  the  team  names  132  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   together with the member names and nicknames. In a production environment the XML processing would be more elaborate, but the basic logic of the client would be the same: issue an appropriate request against the service and process the response in some appropriate way. On a sample client run, the output was:  The GET request is: http:  localhost:8888 teams The raw XML response is:                           BurnsAndAllen                                                          George Burns                                George                                                                  Gracie Allen                                Gracie                                                     ...   ;;;  BurnsAndAllen George Burns George Gracie Allen Gracie AbbottAndCostello William Abbott Bud Louis Cristillo Lou MarxBrothers  A RESTful Version of the Teams Service  133  Download at Boykma.Com   Leonard Marx Chico Julius Marx Groucho Adolph Marx Harpo  The output below the semicolons consists of the extracted team names, together with the member names and nicknames.

Java offers an assortment of XML-processing tools and the code examples illustrate several. A SAX parser is stream-based and event-driven— the parser receives a stream of bytes, invoking callbacks  such as the methods named startElement and characters shown above  to handle specific events, in this case the occurrence  of  XML  start  tags  and  character  data  in  between  start  and  end  tags, respectively.  Summary of the RESTful Features This  first  restricted  example  covers  some  key  features  of  RESTful  services  but  also ignores one such feature. Following is a summary of the example so far:    In a request, the pairing of an HTTP verb such as GET with a URI such as http:  ...  teams specifies a CRUD operation against a resource; in this example, a request to read available information about comedy teams.    The  service  uses  HTTP  status  codes  such  as  404   resource  not  found   and  405   method not allowed  to respond to bad requests.    If the request is a good one, the service responds with an XML representation that captures the state of the requested resource. So far, the service honors only GET requests, but the other CRUD verbs will be added in the forthcoming revision.    The service does not take advantage of MIME types. A client issues a request for either a named team or a list of all teams but does not indicate a preference for the type of representation returned  for instance, text plain as opposed to text xml or text html . A later example does illustrate typed requests and responses.    The RESTful service implementation is not constrained in the same way as a SOAP- based service precisely because there is no formal service contract. The implemen- tation is flexible but, of course, likewise ad hoc. This issue will be raised often.  The next section extends the service to handle requests issued with the POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs.  Implementing the Remaining CRUD Operations The  remaining  CRUD  operations—create   POST ,  update   PUT ,  and  delete  DELETE —have side effects, which requires that the RestfulTeams service update the in-memory data structures  in this case, the list and the map of teams  and the persis- tence store  in this case, the local file teams.ser . The service follows an eager rather than a lazy strategy for updating teams.ser—this file is updated on every successful POST, PUT, and DELETE request. A lazier and more efficient strategy might be fol- lowed in a production environment. The RestfulTeams implementation of the invoke method changes only slightly to ac- commodate the new request possibilities. Here is the change:  136  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   MessageContext msg_ctx = ws_ctx.getMessageContext  ; String http_verb =  String  msg_ctx.get MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD ; http_verb = http_verb.trim  .toUpperCase  ;     Act on the verb. if       http_verb.equals "GET"      return doGet msg_ctx ; else if  http_verb.equals "DELETE"   return doDelete msg_ctx ; else if  http_verb.equals "POST"     return doPost msg_ctx ; else if  http_verb.equals "PUT"      return doPut msg_ctx ; else throw new HTTPException 405 ;      method not allowed        The doPost method expects that the request contains an XML document with infor- mation about the new team to be created. Following is a sample:        SmothersBrothers             Thomas        Tom                  Richard        Dickie                Of course, an XML Schema that describes precisely this layout could be distributed to clients. In this example, the doPost does not validate the request document against a schema but rather parses the document to find required information such as the team’s name and the players’ names. If required information is missing, an HTTP status code of 500  internal error  or 400  bad request  is sent back to the client. Here is the added doPost method:  private Source doPost MessageContext msg_ctx  {     Map  request =  Map         msg_ctx.get MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS ;      List  cargo = request.get post_put_key ;     if  cargo == null  throw new HTTPException 400 ;    bad request      String xml = "";     for  String next : cargo  xml += next.trim  ;     ByteArrayInputStream xml_stream = new ByteArrayInputStream xml.getBytes   ;     String team_name = null;      try {            Set up the XPath object to search for the XML elements.

The JAX-P tools were designed to facilitate XML processing, which addresses the needs of a RESTful service. In this example, the two key pieces are the DOMResult and the XPath object. In the Java TeamsClient shown earlier, a SAX parser is used to process the list of comedy teams returned from the RestfulTeams service on a successful GET request with no query string. A SAX parser is stream-based and in- vokes programmer-supplied callbacks to process various parsing events such as the occurrence of an XML start tag. By contrast, a DOM  Document Object Model  parser is tree-based in that the parser constructs a tree representation of a well-formed XML document. The programmer then can use a standard API, for example, to search the tree for desired elements. JAX-P uses the XSLT  eXtensible Stylesheet Language Trans- formations  verb transform to describe the process of transforming an XML source  for instance, the request bytes from a client  into an XML result  for instance, a DOM tree . Here is the statement in doPost that does just this:  trans.transform new StreamSource xml_stream , dom ;  The xml_stream refers to the bytes from the client in a ByteArrayInputStream, and dom refers to a DOMResult. A DOM tree can be processed in various ways. In this case, an XPath object is used to search for relatively simple patterns. For instance, the statement:  138  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   NodeList players =  NodeList  xp.evaluate "player", dom.getNode  ,                                           XPathConstants.NODESET ;  gets a list of elements tagged with player from the DOM tree. The statements:  String name = xp.evaluate "name", dom.getNode   ; String nickname = xp.evaluate "nickname", dom.getNode   ;                                           then extract the player’s name and nickname from the DOM tree. The doPost method respects the HTTP verb from which the method gets its name. After the name of the new team has been extracted from the request XML document, a check is made:  team_name = xp.evaluate " create_team name", dom.getNode   ; if  team_map.containsKey team_name   throw new HTTPException 400 ;    bad request  to determine whether a team with that name already exists. Because a POST request signals a create operation, an already existing team cannot be created but instead must be updated through a PUT request. Once the needed information about the new team has been extracted from the request XML document, the data structures Map  and List  are updated to reflect a successful create operation. The list of teams is serialized to the persistence file. The two remaining CRUD operations, update and delete, are implemented as the meth- ods doPut and doDelete, respectively. The RestfulTeams service requires that a DELETE request have a query string to identify a particular team; the deletion of all teams at once is not allowed. For now, a PUT request can update only a team’s name, although this easily could be expanded to allow updates to the team’s members and their names or nicknames. Here are the implementations of doPut and doDelete:  private Source doDelete MessageContext msg_ctx  {     String query_string =  String  msg_ctx.get MessageContext.QUERY_STRING ;         Disallow the deletion of all teams at once.     if  query_string == null  throw new HTTPException 403 ;    illegal operation     else {         String name = get_value_from_qs "name", query_string ;         if  !team_map.containsKey name   throw new HTTPException 404 ;             Remove team from Map and List, serialize to file.         Team team = team_map.get name ;         teams.remove team ;         team_map.remove name ;         serialize  ;             Send response.         return response_to_client name + " deleted." ;     } }        private Source doPut MessageContext msg_ctx  {        Parse the query string.

Recall that GET and DELETE requests result in HTTP messages that have no body, whereas POST and PUT requests result in HTTP messages with bodies. Clients of the RestfulTeams service do not use the HTTP body at all. Even in a POST or PUT request, information about the new team to create or the existing team to update is contained in the HTTP header rather than in the body. The approach in the RestfulTeams service illustrates the flexibility of REST-style serv- ices. The revision in this section shows how the HTTP body can be used in a POST request by introducing the Dispatch interface, which is the client-side twin of the server- side Provider interface. The RestfulTeams service already illustrates that a Provider on  148  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   the service side can be used without a Dispatch on the client side; and a later example shows how a Dispatch can be used on the client side regardless of how the RESTful service is implemented. Nonetheless, the Provider and Dispatch interfaces are a natural pair. A RESTful Provider implements the method:  public Source invoke Source request   and a Dispatch object, sometimes described as a dynamic service proxy, provides an implementation of this method on the client side. Recall that a Source is a source of an XML document suitable as input to a Transform, which then generates a Result that is typically an XML document as well. The Dispatch to Provider relationship supports a natural exchange of XML documents between client and service:    The client invokes the Dispatch method invoke, with an XML document as the Source  argument.  If  the  request  does  not  require  an  XML  document,  then  the Source argument can be null.    The  service-side  runtime  dispatches  the  client  request  to  the  Provider  method  invoke whose Source argument corresponds to the client-side Source.    The service transforms the Source into some appropriate Result  for instance, a DOM tree , processes this Result in an application-appropriate way, and returns an XML source to the client. If no response is needed, null can be returned.    The Dispatch method invoke returns a Source, sent from the service, that the client  then transforms into an appropriate Result and processes as needed.  The fact that the Provider method invoke and the Dispatch method invoke have the same signature underscores the natural fit between them.  A Provider Dispatch Example The RabbitCounterProvider is a RESTful service that revises the SOAP-based version of Chapter 3. The RESTful revision honors POST, GET, and DELETE requests from clients. A POST request, as a CRUD create operation, creates a list of Fibonacci num- bers that the service caches for subsequent read or delete operations. The doPost method responds to a POST request and the method expects a Source argument, which is the source of an XML document such as:   [1, 2, 3, 4]   The XML document is thus a list of integers whose Fibonacci values are to be computed. The doGet and doDelete methods handle GET and PUT requests, respectively, neither of which has an HTTP body; hence, the doGet and doDelete methods do not have a Source parameter. All three methods return a Source value, which is the source of an XML confirmation. For example, doPost returns a confirmation XML document such as:   POSTed[1, 1, 2, 3]   The Provider and Dispatch Twins   149  Download at Boykma.Com   The other two methods return operation-specific confirmations.

The call to xp.evaluate, shown in bold above, takes two arguments: an XPath pattern, in this case  fib:request, and the DOMResult node that contains the desired string data between the start tag   and the corresponding end tag  . The fib in fib:request is a proxy or alias for a namespace URI, in this case urn:fib. The entire start tag in the request XML document is:           152  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   The  NSResolver  class   NS  is  short  for  namespace   provides  mappings  from  fib  to urn:fib and vice-versa. Here is the code:  package ch04.dispatch;  import java.util.Collections; import java.util.Map; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Iterator; import javax.xml.namespace.NamespaceContext;  public class NSResolver implements NamespaceContext {     private Map  prefix2uri;     private Map  uri2prefix;     public NSResolver   {         if  prefix2uri == null  prefix2uri =            Collections.synchronizedMap new HashMap    ;         if  uri2prefix == null  uri2prefix =            Collections.synchronizedMap new HashMap    ;     }      public NSResolver String prefix, String uri  {         this  ;         prefix2uri.put prefix, uri ;         uri2prefix.put uri, prefix ;     }      public String getNamespaceURI String prefix  { return prefix2uri.get prefix ; }     public String getPrefix String uri  { return uri2prefix.get uri ; }     public Iterator getPrefixes String uri  { return uri2prefix.keySet  .iterator  ; } }  The NSResolver provides the namespace context for the XPath searches; that is, the resolver binds together a namespace URI and its proxies or aliases. For the application to work correctly, a client and the service must use the same namespace URI; in this case the structurally simple URI urn:fib.  More on the Dispatch Interface The Dispatch-based client of the RESTful RabbitCounterProvider service has features reminiscent of a client for a SOAP-based service. The client creates identifying QName instances for a service and a port, creates a service object and adds a port, and then creates a Dispatch proxy associated with the port. Here is the code segment:  QName service_name = new QName "rcService", ns_URI.toString   ;    uri is urn:fib QName port = new QName "rcPort", ns_URI.toString   ; String endpoint = "http:  localhost:9876 fib";    Now create a service proxy or dispatcher. Service service = Service.create service_name ; service.addPort port, HTTPBinding.HTTP_BINDING, endpoint ; Dispatch  dispatch =     service.createDispatch port, Source.class, Service.Mode.PAYLOAD ;     The Provider and Dispatch Twins   153  Download at Boykma.Com   This client-side dispatch object can dispatch XML documents as requests to the service as XML Source instances. A document is sent to the service through an invocation of the invoke method. Here are two code segments. In the first, an XML document is prepared as the body of a POST request:  String xml_start = " "; String xml_end = " "; List  nums = new ArrayList   ; for  int i = 0; i < 12; i++  nums.add i + 1 ; String xml = xml_start + nums.toString   + xml_end;  In the second, the request XML document is wrapped in Source and then sent to the service through an invocation of invoke:  StreamSource source = null; if  data != null  source = make_stream_source data.toString   ;    data = XML doc Source result = dispatch.invoke source ; display_result result, uri ;    do an XPath search of the resturned XML  The  GET  and  DELETE  operations  do  not  require  XML  documents;  hence,  the Source argument to invoke is null in both cases. Here is a client-side trace of the requests sent to the service and the responses received in return:  Request:              [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]            POSTed: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]  Request: null GET: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]  Request: null DELETE: Map cleared.

This section illustrates how a SOAP-based service can be treated as if it were REST style. This use of Dispatch underscores that SOAP-based web services delivered over HTTP, as most are, represent a special case of REST-style serv- ices. What the SOAP libraries spare the programmer is the need to process XML directly on either the service or the client side, with handlers as the exception to this rule. The DispatchClientTS application uses a Dispatch proxy to submit a request against the SOAP-based TimeServer service of Chapter 1. The TimeServer supports two oper- ations: one supplies the current time as a human-readable string, whereas the other supplies the time as the elapsed milliseconds from the Unix epoch.

The rest of the setup is straight- forward. After a service object is created and a port added with the TimeServer’s end- point, a Dispatch proxy is created with a Service.Mode.PAYLOAD so that the SOAP request document becomes an XML Source transported to the service in the body of the HTTP request.  The  SOAP-based  service  responds  with  a  SOAP  envelope,  which  an  XPath object then searches for the integer value that gives the elapsed milliseconds. On a sample run, the output was 1,214,514,573,623  with commas added for readability  on a RESTful call to getTimeAsElapsed.  Implementing RESTful Web Services As HttpServlets Here is a short review of servlets with emphasis on their use to deliver RESTful services. The class HttpServlet extends the class GenericServlet, which in turn implements the Servlet interface. All three are in the package javax.servlet, which is not included in core Java. The Servlet interface declares five methods, the most important of which is the service method that a web container invokes on every request to a servlet. The service method has a ServletRequest and a ServletResponse parameter. The request is a map that contains the request information from a client, and the response provides a  network  connection  back  to  the  client.  The  GenericServlet  class  implements  the Service methods in a transport-neutral fashion, whereas its HttpServlet subclass im- plements these methods in an HTTP-specific way. Accordingly, the service parame- ters in the HttpServlet have the types HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse. The HttpServlet also provides request filtering: the service method dispatches an in- coming GET request to the method doGet, an incoming POST request to the method doPost, and so on. Figure 4-2 depicts a servlet container with several servlets.  Figure 4-2. A servlet container with instances of various servlets  In the HttpServlet class, the do methods are no-ops  that is, methods with empty bod- ies  that can be overridden as needed in a programmer-derived subclass. For example, if the class MyServlet extends HttpServlet and overrides doGet but not doPost, then doPost remains a no-op in MyServlet instances. HttpServlets are a natural, convenient way to implement RESTful web services for two reasons. First, such servlets provide methods such as doGet and doDelete that match up with HTTP verbs, and these methods execute as callbacks that the web container invokes  as  needed.  Second,  the  HttpServletRequest  and  HttpServletResponse  are the same two arguments to every do method, which encourages a uniform pattern of request processing: client-supplied data are read from the HttpServletRequest map and  Implementing RESTful Web Services As HttpServlets   159  Servlet Container  s1  s2  s3  . . .  sn  Download at Boykma.Com   processed as required; then a response is sent back to the client through the output stream associated with the HttpServletResponse.  The RabbitCounterServlet The RabbitCounterServlet that follows is a RESTful, servlet-based version of the SOAP- based RabbitCounter service of Chapter 3. The service has a deliberately simple logic to keep focus on what makes the servlet such an attractive implementation of a RESTful service.

The container Apache Tomcat, typically shortened to Tomcat, is the reference implementation for servlet containers and is available for free download at http:  tomcat.apache.org. The current version is 6.x. For simplicity, assume that TOMCAT_HOME is the install di- rectory. Immediately under TOMCAT_HOME are three subdirectories of interest:  TOMCAT_HOME bin  This subdirectory contains startup and shutdown scripts for Unix and Windows. To start Tomcat, execute the startup script. To test whether Tomcat started, open a browser to the URL http:  localhost:8080.  TOMCAT_HOME logs  Tomcat maintains various log files, which are helpful for determining whether a servlet deployed successfully.  TOMCAT_HOME webapps  Servlets  are  deployed  as  WAR   Web  ARchive   files,  which  are  JAR  files  with a .war extension. To deploy a servlet, copy its WAR file to this directory. A detailed explanation follows.  The source code for the RabbitCounterServlet is in the package ch04.rc. Here are the steps for compiling, packaging, and deploying the servlet. The compilation command occurs at the working directory, which has ch04 as a subdirectory:    The servlet must be compiled with various packages that Tomcat supplies. Here  is the command from the working directory:  % javac -cp .:TOMCAT_HOME lib servlet-api.jar ch04 rc *.java  On  Unix-like  systems,  it  is  $TOMCAT_HOME  and  on  Windows  systems,  it  is %TOMCAT_HOME%.  Also,  Unix-like  systems  use  the  colon  to  separate  items  on  the classpath, whereas Windows uses the semicolon.    In a deployed WAR file, Tomcat expects to find .class files such as the compiled RabbitCounterServlet in the tree rooted at WEB-INF classes. In the working di- rectory,  create  the  subdirectory  WEB-INF classes ch04 rc  and  then  copy  the compiled servlet into this subdirectory.  Implementing RESTful Web Services As HttpServlets   163  Download at Boykma.Com     Almost every production-grade servlet has a configuration file named WEB-INF  web.xml, although technically this is no longer a requirement. Here is the config- uration file for this example:    <web-app      xmlns="http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee"      xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"      xsi:schemaLocation="http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee          http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee web-app_2_4.xsd"          version="2.4">    RabbitCounter Servlet                 rcounter                      ch04.rc.RabbitCounterServlet                    0                       rcounter            fib           Of interest now is the url-pattern section, which gives  fib as the pattern. Assume that the servlet resides in the WAR file rc.war, as will be shown shortly. In this case,  the  URL  for  the  servlet  is  http:  localhost:8080 rc fib.  The  configuration document recommends that Tomcat not load a servlet instance when the servlet is first deployed but rather to wait until the first client request.    The servlet is now ready to be packaged and deployed. From the working directory,  the command:  % jar cvf rc.war WEB-INF  creates the WAR file, which holds the configuration file web.xml and the compiled servlet. Then deploy the WAR file by copying it to TOMCAT_HOME webapps. A Tomcat log file can be inspected to see whether the deployment succeeded, or a browser can be opened to URL http:  localhost:8080 rc fib.  The RabbitCounterServlet overrides the init method, which the servlet container in- vokes when the servlet is first loaded. The method constructs the map that stores the Fibonacci numbers computed on a POST request. The other supported HTTP verbs are GET and DELETE. A GET request without a query string is treated as a request to read all of the numbers available, whereas a GET request with a query string is treated as a request for a specific Fibonacci number. The service allows the deletion of only one Fibonacci number at a time; hence, a DELETE request must have a query string that specifies which number to delete. The service does not implement the remaining CRUD operation, update; hence, the doPut method, like the remaining do methods, throws an HTTP 405 exception using the constant:  HttpServletResponse.SC_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED  164  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   for clarity. There are similar constants for the other HTTP status codes.  Requests for MIME-Typed Responses The RabbitCounterServlet differs from the first RESTful example in being implemented as a servlet instead of as a @WebServiceProvider. The RESTful servlet differs in a second way as well; that is, by honoring the request that a response be of a specified MIME type. Here is a client against the servlet:  import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.net.URL; import java.net.HttpURLConnection; import java.net.URLEncoder; import java.net.MalformedURLException; import java.net.URLEncoder; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.DataOutputStream; import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.InputStreamReader;  class ClientRC {     private static final String url = "http:  localhost:8080 rc fib";      public static void main String[ ] args  {         new ClientRC  .send_requests  ;     }      private void send_requests   {         try {             HttpURLConnection conn = null;                 POST request to create some Fibonacci numbers.             List  nums = new ArrayList   ;             for  int i = 1; i < 15; i++  nums.add i ;             String payload = URLEncoder.encode "nums", "UTF-8"  + "=" +                 URLEncoder.encode nums.toString  , "UTF-8" ;                 Send the request             conn = get_connection url, "POST" ;             conn.setRequestProperty "accept", "text xml" ;             DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream conn.getOutputStream   ;             out.writeBytes payload ;             out.flush  ;             get_response conn ;                 GET to test whether POST worked             conn = get_connection url, "GET" ;             conn.addRequestProperty "accept", "text xml" ;             conn.connect  ;             get_response conn ;              conn = get_connection url + "?num=12", "GET" ;             conn.addRequestProperty "accept", "text plain" ;  Implementing RESTful Web Services As HttpServlets   165  Download at Boykma.Com               conn.connect  ;             get_response conn ;                 DELETE request             conn = get_connection url + "?num=12", "DELETE" ;             conn.addRequestProperty "accept", "text xml" ;             conn.connect  ;             get_response conn ;                 GET request to test whether DELETE worked             conn = get_connection url + "?num=12", "GET" ;             conn.addRequestProperty "accept", "text html" ;             conn.connect  ;             get_response conn ;         }         catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; }         catch NullPointerException e  { System.err.println e ; }     }      private HttpURLConnection get_connection String url_string, String verb  {         HttpURLConnection conn = null;         try {             URL url = new URL url_string ;             conn =  HttpURLConnection  url.openConnection  ;             conn.setRequestMethod verb ;             conn.setDoInput true ;             conn.setDoOutput true ;         }         catch MalformedURLException e  { System.err.println e ; }         catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; }         return conn;     }     private void get_response HttpURLConnection conn  {         try {             String xml = "";             BufferedReader reader =                 new BufferedReader new InputStreamReader conn.getInputStream    ;             String next = null;             while   next = reader.readLine    != null                  xml += next;             System.out.println "The response:\n" + xml ;         }         catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; }     } }       The client sends POST, GET, and DELETE requests, each of which specifies the desired MIME type of the response. For example, in the POST request the statement:  conn.setRequestProperty "accept", "text xml" ;  requests that the response be an XML document. The value of the accept key need not be a single MIME type. For instance, the request statement could be:  conn.setRequestProperty "accept", "text xml, text xml, application soap" ;  166  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   Indeed, the listed types can be prioritized and weighted for the service’s consideration. This example sticks with single MIME types such as text html. The RabbitCounterServlet can send responses of MIME types text xml  the default , text html, and text plain. Here is the client’s output, slightly formatted and docu- mented for readability:  The response:    from the initial POST request to create some Fibonacci numbers            [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377] added.       The response:    from a GET request to confirm that the POST worked        [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377]      The response:    from a GET request with text plain as the desired type 144  The response:    from a DELETE request        12 deleted.      The response:    from a GET to confirm the DELETE with HTML as the desired type    send_html response     -1      In the last response, the returned value of –1 signals that the Fibonacci number for 12 is not available. The XML and HTML formats are simple, of course, but they illustrate how RESTful services can generate typed responses that satisfy requests.  Java Clients Against Real-World RESTful Services There are many RESTful services available from well-known players such as Yahoo!, Amazon, and eBay, although controversy continues around the issue of what counts as a truly RESTful service.

The client uses a Dispatch object to issue the request and an XPath object to search the DOM  result  for  selected  elements.  The  output  above  includes  the  Summary  and  the ClickURL elements from the raw XML. As quantum gravity is not a hot news topic, there were only 9 results from a request for 10. The Yahoo! example underscores that clients of RESTful services assume the burden of processing the response document, which is typically XML, in some way that is appropriate to the application. Although there generally is an XML Schema that speci- fies how the raw XML is formatted, there is no service contract comparable to the WSDL used in SOAP-based services.  The Amazon E-Commerce Service: REST Style Yahoo! exposes only RESTful web services, but Amazon provides its web services in two ways, as SOAP-based and as REST-style. The AmazonClientREST application that follows issues a read request against the Amazon E-Commerce service for books about the Fibonacci numbers. The client uses a Dispatch object and an HTTP GET request with a query string that specifies the details of the request:  import java.util.Map; import javax.xml.namespace.QName; import javax.xml.ws.Service; import javax.xml.ws.Dispatch; import javax.xml.ws.http.HTTPBinding; import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource; import javax.xml.transform.Source; import javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory; import javax.xml.transform.Transformer; import javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMResult; import javax.xml.transform.TransformerConfigurationException; import javax.xml.transform.TransformerException; import javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory; import javax.xml.xpath.XPath; import javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants; import javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionException;  170  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import org.w3c.dom.NodeList; import org.w3c.dom.Node; import ch04.dispatch.NSResolver;  class AmazonClientREST {     private final static String uri =         "http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2005-03-23";      public static void main String[ ] args  throws Exception {         if  args.length < 1  {             System.err.println "Usage: AmazonClientREST  " ;             return;         }         new AmazonClientREST  .item_search args[0].trim   ;     }      private void item_search String access_key  {         QName service_name = new QName "awsREST", uri ;         QName port = new QName "awsPort", uri ;          String base_url = "http:  ecs.amazonaws.com onca xml";         String qs = "?Service=AWSECommerceService&" +             "Version=2005-03-23&" +             "Operation=ItemSearch&" +             "ContentType=text%2Fxml&" +             "AWSAccessKeyId=" +  access_key + "&" +             "SearchIndex=Books&" +             "Keywords=Fibonacci";         String endpoint = base_url + qs;             Now create a service proxy dispatcher.

However, the raw  XML  conforms  to  the  very  same  XML  Schema  document  that  is  used  in  the E-Commerce WSDL contract for the SOAP-based version of the service. In effect, then, the only difference is that the raw XML is wrapped in a SOAP envelope in the case of the SOAP-based service, but is simply the payload of the HTTP response in the case of the REST-style service. Here is a segment of the raw XML:    <ItemSearchResponse      xmlns="http:  webservices.amazon.com AWSECommerceService 2005-03-23">    ...

For variety, the AmazonClientREST parses the raw XML in a slightly different way than in earlier examples. In particular, the client uses XPath to get separate lists of authors and book titles:  NodeList authors =  NodeList  xp.evaluate "  aws:ItemAttributes aws:Author",                                 dom_result.getNode  , XPathConstants.NODESET ; NodeList titles =  NodeList   xp.evaluate "  aws:ItemAttributes aws:Title",                                 dom_result.getNode  , XPathConstants.NODESET ;  and then loops through the lists to extract the author and the title using the DOM API. Here is the loop:  int len = authors.getLength  ; for  int i = 0; i < len; i++  {    Node author = authors.item i ;    Node title  = titles.item i ;    if  author != null && title != null  {      String a_name = author.getFirstChild  .getNodeValue  ;      String t_name = title.getFirstChild  .getNodeValue  ;      System.out.printf "%s: %s\n", a_name, t_name ;    } }  that produced, on a sample run, the following output:  Carolyn Boroden: Fibonacci Trading: How to Master Time and Price Advantage Kimberly Elam: Geometry of Design: Studies in Proportion and Composition Alfred S.

The Amazon Simple Storage Service, known as Amazon S3, is a pay-for service also accessible through a SOAP-based or a RESTful client. As the name indicates, the service allows users to store and retrieve individual data objects, each of up to 5G in size. S3 is often cited as a fine example of a useful web service with a very simple interface.  The RESTful Tumblr Service Perhaps the Tumblr service is best known for the associated term tumblelog or tlog, a variation  on  the  traditional  blog  that  emphasizes  short  text  entries  with  associated multimedia such as photos, music, and film. It is common for tumblelogs to be artistic endeavors. The service is free but the full set of RESTful operations requires a user account, which can be set up at http:  www.tumblr.com.  Java Clients Against Real-World RESTful Services   173  Download at Boykma.Com   The TumblrClient that follows uses an HttpURLConnection to send a GET and a POST request against the Tumblr RESTful service. In this case, the HttpURLConnection is a better choice than Dispatch because a POST request to Tumblr does not contain an XML document but rather the standard key value pairs.

Long haul up, fun going down.  The client then sends a POST request, which adds a new entry in my Tumblr posts. The  URL  now  changes  to  the  main  Tumblr  site,  http:  www.tumblr.com,  with   api  write appended. My email and password must be included in the POST request’s pay- load, which the following code segment handles:  String payload =    URLEncoder.encode "email", "UTF-8"  + "=" +    URLEncoder.encode email, "UTF-8"  + "&" +    URLEncoder.encode "password", "UTF-8"  + "=" +    URLEncoder.encode password, "UTF-8"  + "&" +    URLEncoder.encode "type", "UTF-8"  + "=" +    URLEncoder.encode "regular", "UTF-8"  + "&" +    URLEncoder.encode "title", "UTF-8"  + "=" +    URLEncoder.encode title, "UTF-8"  + "&" +    URLEncoder.encode "body", "UTF-8"  + "=" +    URLEncoder.encode body, "UTF-8" ; DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream conn.getOutputStream   ; out.writeBytes payload ; out.flush  ;  The documentation for the Tumblr API is a single page. The API supports the CRUD read and create operations through the  api read and the  api write suffixes. As usual, a read operation is done through a GET request, and a create operation is done through a POST request. Tumblr does support some variation. For example, the suffix  api  read json causes the response to be JSON  JavaScript Object Notation  instead of XML. An HTTP POST to the Tumblr site can be used to upload images, audio, and film in addition to text postings, and multimedia may be uploaded as either unencoded bytes or as standard URL-encoded payloads in the POST request’s body. The simplicity of the Tumblr API encourages the building of graphical interfaces and plugins that, in turn, allow Tumblr to interact easily with other sites such as Facebook. The Tumblr API is a fine example of how much can be done with so little.  WADLing with Java-Based RESTful Services In SOAP-based web services, the WSDL document is a blessing to programmers be- cause this service contract can be used to generate client-side artifacts and, indeed, even a service-side interface. RESTful services do not have an official or even widely accepted counterpart to the WSDL, although there are efforts in that direction. Among them is  WADLing with Java-Based RESTful Services   177  Download at Boykma.Com   the WADL initiative  https:  wadl.dev.java.net . WADL stands for Web Application Description Language. The WADL download includes the wadl2java utility, a library of required JAR files, and  a  sample  WADL  file  named  YahooSearch.wadl.  The  download  also  has  Ant, Maven, and command-line scripts for convenience. To begin, here is a Yahoo! client that uses wadl2java-generated artifacts:  import com.yahoo.search.ResultSet; import com.yahoo.search.ObjectFactory; import com.yahoo.search.Endpoint; import com.yahoo.search.Endpoint.NewsSearch; import com.yahoo.search.Type; import com.yahoo.search.Result; import com.yahoo.search.Sort; import com.yahoo.search.ImageType; import com.yahoo.search.Output; import com.yahoo.search.Error; import com.yahoo.search.SearchErrorException; import javax.xml.bind.JAXBException; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.List;  class YahooWADL {     public static void main String[ ] args  {         if  args.length < 1  {             System.err.println "Usage: YahooWADL  " ;             return;         }         String app_id = args[0];         try {             NewsSearch service = new NewsSearch  ;             String query = "neutrino";              ResultSet result_set = service.getAsResultSet app_id, query ;             List  list = result_set.getResultList  ;             int i = 1;             for  Result next : list  {                 String title = next.getTitle  ;                 String click = next.getClickUrl  ;                 System.out.printf " %d  %s %s\n", i++, title, click ;             }         }         catch JAXBException e  { System.err.println e ; }         catch SearchErrorException e  { System.err.println e ; }         catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; }     } }      The code is cleaner than my original YahooClient. The wadl2java-generated code hides the XML processing and other grimy details such as the formatting of an appropriate query string for a GET request against the Yahoo! News Service. The client-side artifacts also include utility classes for getting images from the Yahoo! service. On a sample run,  178  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   the  YahooWADL client produced this output on a request for articles that include the keyword neutrino:   1  Congress to the rescue for Fermi jobs http:  www.dailyherald.com story ...  2  AIP FYI 69: Senate FY 2009 National Science Foundation Funding Bill...  3  Linked by Thom Holwerda on Wed 12th Sep 2007 11:51 UTC...  4  The World's Nine Largest Science Projects http:  science.slashdot.org ...  5  Funding bill may block Fermi layoffs http:  www.suntimes.com business ...  6  In print http:  www.sciencenews.org view generic id 33654 title For_Kids...  7  Recent Original Stories http:  www.osnews.com thread?284017  8  Antares : un télescope pointé vers le sol qui utilise la terre comme filtre...  9  Software addresses quality of hands-free car phone audio...  10  Planetary science: Tunguska at 100 http:  www.nature.com news 2008 ...

Next comes a list of available resources, in this case only the news search service. The methods section describes the HTTP verbs and, by implication, the CRUD operations that can be used against the service. In the case of the Yahoo! news service, only GET requests are allowed. The remaining sections provide details about the parameters that can accompany requests and responses. XSD type information of the sort found in WSDL documents occurs throughout the WADL as well. Executing the wadl2java utility on the YahooSearch.wadl file generates 11 Java source files, the most important of which for the client-side programmer is Endpoint.java. The Endpoint class encapsulates the static class NewsSearch, an instance of which has utility methods such as getAsResultSet. For reference, here is the main segment of the client YahooWADL shown earlier. The WADL artifacts allow the code to be short and clear:  NewsSearch service = new NewsSearch  ; String query = "neutrino";  ResultSet result_set = service.getAsResultSet app_id, query ; List  list = result_set.getResultList  ; int i = 1; for  Result next : list  {    String title = next.getTitle  ;    String click = next.getClickUrl  ;    System.out.printf " %d  %s %s\n", i++, title, click ; }      The search string, given in this case with the object reference query, is just a list of keywords separated by blanks. The NewsSearch object has properties for specifying sort order, the maximum number of items to return, and the like. The generated artifacts do lighten the coding burden. WADL has stirred interest and discussion but remains, for now, a Java-centric initiative. The critical issue is whether REST-style services can be standardized to the extent that utilities such as wadl2java and perhaps java2wadl can measure up to the utilities now available for SOAP-based services. If it is fair to criticize SOAP-based services for being over-engineered, it is also fair to fault REST-style services for being under-engineered.  WADLing with Java-Based RESTful Services   181  Download at Boykma.Com   Problems in the wadl2java-Generated Code Among the files that the wadl2java utility generates are Error.java and ObjectFactory.java.  In  each  file,  any  occurrences  of  urn:yahoo:api should be changed to urn:yahoo:yn. In the 1.0 distribution, there were two occurrences in each source file. Without these changes, a JAX-B exception is thrown when the results from the Yahoo! search are un- marshaled into Java objects. The changes could be made to the XSD document and the WADL document that the wadl2java utility uses.  JAX-RS: WADLing Through Jersey Jersey is the centerpiece project for the recent JAX-RS  Java API for XML-RESTful Web Services .  Jersey  applications  can  be  deployed  through  familiar  commercial-grade containers  such  as  standalone  Tomcat  and  GlassFish,  but  Jersey  also  provides  the lightweight  Grizzly  container  that  is  well  suited  for  learning  the  framework.  Jersey works well with Maven. A deployed Jersey service automatically generates a WADL, which is then available through a standard GET request. A good place to start is https:   jersey.dev.java.net. A Jersey service adheres to REST principles. A service accepts the usual RESTful re- quests  for  CRUD  operations  specified  with  the  standard  HTTP  verbs  GET,  POST, DELETE, and PUT. A request is targeted at a Jersey resource, which is a POJO. Here is the MsgResource class to illustrate:  package msg.resources;   import javax.ws.rs.Path; import javax.ws.rs.PathParam; import javax.ws.rs.FormParam; import javax.ws.rs.Produces; import javax.ws.rs.GET; import javax.ws.rs.POST; import javax.ws.rs.DELETE; import java.beans.XMLEncoder; import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;     This is the base path, which can be extended at the method level. @Path " "  public class MsgResource {     private static String msg = "Hello, world!";      @GET     @Produces "text plain"      public String read   {         return msg + "\n";     }      @GET     @Produces "text plain"      @Path "{extra}"   182  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com       public String personalized_read @PathParam "extra"  String cus  {         return this.msg + ": " + cus + "\n";     }      @POST     @Produces "text xml"      public String create @FormParam "msg"  String new_msg   {         this.msg = new_msg;          ByteArrayOutputStream stream = new ByteArrayOutputStream  ;         XMLEncoder enc = new XMLEncoder stream ;         enc.writeObject new_msg ;         enc.close  ;         return new String stream.toByteArray    + "\n";     }      @DELETE     @Produces "text plain"      public String delete   {         this.msg = null;         return "Message deleted.\n";     } }  The class has intuitive annotations, including the ones for the HTTP verbs and the response MIME types. The @Path annotation right above the MsgResource class decla- ration is used to decouple the resource from any particular base URL. For example, the MsgResource might be available at the base URL http:  foo.bar.org:1234, at the base URL http:  localhost:9876, and so on. The @GET, @POST, and @DELETE annotations specify the appropriate HTTP verb for a particular service operation. The @Produces annotation specifies the MIME type of the response, in this case either text plain for the GET and DELETE operations or text xml for the POST operation. Each method annotated as a MsgResource is responsible for generating the declared response type. The MsgResource class could be put in a WAR file along with the supporting Jersey JAR files and then deployed in a servlet container such as Tomcat. There is, however, a quick way to publish a Jersey service during development. Here is the publisher class to illustrate:  import com.sun.jersey.api.container.grizzly.GrizzlyWebContainerFactory; import java.util.Map; import java.util.HashMap;  class JerseyPublisher {     public static void main String[ ] args  {         final String base_url = "http:  localhost:9876 ";         final Map  config = new HashMap   ;          config.put "com.sun.jersey.config.property.packages",                    "msg.resources" ;    package with resource classes          System.out.println "Grizzly starting on port 9876.\n" +                            "Kill with Control-C.\n" ;  JAX-RS: WADLing Through Jersey  183  Download at Boykma.Com           try {             GrizzlyWebContainerFactory.create base_url, config ;         }         catch Exception e  { System.err.println e ; }     } }  Grizzly  requires  configuration  information  about  the  package,  in  this  case  named msg.resources, that contains the resources available to clients. In this example, the package houses only the single class MsgResource but could house several resources. On each incoming request, the Grizzly container surveys the available resources to deter- mine which method should handle the request. RESTful routing is thus in effect. For example, a POSTed request is delegated only to a method annotated with @POST. Compiling and executing the resource and the publisher requires that several Jersey JAR files be on the classpath. Here is the list of five under the current release:  asm-3.1.jar   grizzly-servlet-webserver-1.8.3.jar   jersey-core-0.9-ea.jar   jersey-server-0.9-ea.jar   jsr311-api-0.9.jar  All of these JAR files, together with others for a Maven-centric version of Jersey, are available at the Jersey home page cited earlier. Once the JerseyPublisher has been started, a browser or a utility such as curl can be used to access the resource. For example, the curl command:  % curl http:  localhost:9876   issues a GET request against the service, which causes the @GET-annotated read method to execute. The response is the default message:  Hello, world!   By contrast, the curl command:  % curl -d msg='Goodbye, cruel world!' http:  localhost:9876 echo fred  issues a POST request against the service, which in turn causes the @POST-annotated create method to execute.  A REST purist might argue that a PUT operation would be more appropriate here, as the create method arguably updates an existing message rather than creates a message.  The create method uses the @FormParam annotation so that the POSTed data are available as the method’s argument. The @FormParam param- eter, in this case the string msg, need not be the same as the method parameter, in this case new_msg. The output is:        Hello, world!           184  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   because the @Produces annotation on the create method specifies text xml as the re- sponse type. The method generates this response type with the XMLEncoder. In addition to the read method, there is a second method, personalized_read, annotated with @GET. The method also has the annotation @Path "{extra}" . For example, the request:  % curl http:  localhost:9876 bye  causes this method to be invoked with bye as the argument. The braces surrounding extra signal that extra is simply a placeholder rather than a literal. A method-level @Path  is  appended  to  the  class-level  @Path.  In  this  example,  the  class-level  @Path  is simply  . The Grizzly publisher automatically generates a WADL document, which is available at:  http:  localhost:9876 application.wadl  Here is the automatically generated WADL for the MsgResource:          <doc xmlns:jersey="http:  jersey.dev.java.net "           jersey:generatedBy="Jersey: 0.9-ea 08 22 2008 04:48 PM" >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <param xmlns:xs="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"                             type="xs:string" name="msg" >                                                                                                                         <param xmlns:xs="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"                         type="xs:string" style="template" name="extra" >                                                                                                                          JAX-RS: WADLing Through Jersey  185  Download at Boykma.Com                      The WADL captures that the MsgResource supports two GET operations, a POST op- eration, and a DELETE operation. The WADL also describes the MIME type of the response representation for each operation. Of course, this WADL document could be used as input to the wadl2java utility. Jersey  is  an  appropriately  lightweight  framework  that  honors  the  spirit  of  RESTful services. The Grizzly publisher is attractive for development, automatically generating a WADL document to describe the published services. For production, the move to a web container, standalone or embedded in an application server, is straightforward because Jersey resources are simply annotated POJOs. The entire JSR-311 API, the Jersey core, comprises only 3 packages and roughly 50 interfaces and classes. For now, JAX-WS and JAX-RS are separate frameworks. It would not be surprising if, in the future, the two frameworks merged.  The Restlet Framework Several web frameworks have embraced REST, perhaps none more decisively than Rails with its ActiveResource type, which implements a resource in the RESTful sense. Rails also emphasizes a RESTful style in routing, with CRUD request operations specified as standard HTTP verbs. Grails is a Rails knockoff implemented in Groovy, which in turn is a Ruby knockoff with access to the standard Java packages. Apache Sling  http:  incubator.apache.org sling site index.html  is a Java-based web framework with a RESTful orientation. The restlet framework  http:  www.restlet.org  adheres to the REST architectural style and draws inspiration from other lightweight but powerful frameworks such as Net- Kernel  http:  www.1060.org  and Rails. As the name indicates, a restlet is a RESTful alternative to the traditional Java servlet. The restlet framework has a client and a service API. The framework is well designed, relatively straightforward, professionally imple- mented, and well documented. It plays well with existing technologies. For example, a restlet can be deployed in a servlet container such as Tomcat or Jetty. The restlet distribution includes integration support for the Spring framework and also comes with the Simple HTTP engine  http:  www.simpleframework.org , which can be embedded in Java applications. The sample restlet in this section is published with the Simple HTTP engine. The FibRestlet application reprises the Fibonacci example yet again. The service, pub- lished with the Simple HTTP engine, illustrates key constructs in a restlet. Here is the source code:  186  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   package ch04.restlet;  import java.util.Collections; import java.util.Map; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Collection; import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList; import org.restlet.Component; import org.restlet.Restlet; import org.restlet.data.Form; import org.restlet.data.MediaType; import org.restlet.data.Method; import org.restlet.data.Parameter; import org.restlet.data.Protocol; import org.restlet.data.Request; import org.restlet.data.Response; import org.restlet.data.Status;  public class FibRestlet {     private Map  cache =         Collections.synchronizedMap new HashMap    ;     private final String xml_start = " ";     private final String xml_stop = " ";      public static void main String[ ] args  {         new FibRestlet  .publish_service  ;     }      private void publish_service   {         try {                Create a component to deploy as a service.             Component component = new Component  ;                 Add an HTTP server to connect clients to the component.                In this case, the Simple HTTP engine is the server.             component.getServers  .add Protocol.HTTP, 7777 ;                 Attach a handler to handle client requests.

The framework supports virtual hosts for commercial-grade applications. The restlet download includes a subdirectory RESTLET_HOME lib that houses the various JAR files for the restlet framework itself and for interoperability with Tomcat, Jetty, Spring, Simple, and so forth. For the sample restlet service in this section, the JAR files com.noelios.restlet.jar, org.restlet.jar, and org.simpleframework.jar must be on the classpath. A restlet client could be written using a standard class such as HttpURLConnection, of course. The following client illustrates the restlet API on the client side, an API that could be used independently of the service API:  import org.restlet.Client; import org.restlet.data.Form; import org.restlet.data.Method; import org.restlet.data.Protocol; import org.restlet.data.Request; import org.restlet.data.Response; import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.io.IOException;  class RestletClient {     public static void main String[ ] args  {         new RestletClient  .send_requests  ;     }      private void send_requests   {         try {                Setup the request.

In this example, the client issues POST and DELETE requests with GET requests to confirm that the create and delete operations against the service were successful.  190  Chapter 4: RESTful Web Services  Download at Boykma.Com   The restlet framework is a quick study. Its chief appeal is its RESTful orientation, which results in a lightweight but powerful software environment for developing and con- suming RESTful services. The chief issue is whether the restlet framework can gain the market and mind share to become the standard environment for RESTful services in Java. The Jersey framework has the JSR seal of approval, which gives this framework a clear advantage.  What’s Next? Web services, whether SOAP based or REST style, likely require security. The term security  is  broad  and  vague.  The  next  chapter  clarifies  the  notion  and  explores  the technologies available for securing web services. The emphasis is on user authentication and authorization, mutual challenge, and message encryption and decryption.  What’s Next?   191  Download at Boykma.Com   Download at Boykma.Com   CHAPTER 5 Web Services Security  Overview of Web Services Security Web services security covers a lot of territory, which cannot be explored all at once. The territory is sufficiently broad that it needs to be divided into smaller, more man- ageable chunks. Here is a sketch of how this chapter and the next cover this territory:  Wire-level security  User authentication and authorization  Security begins at the transport or wire level; that is, with basic protocols that govern communications between a web service, whether SOAP-based or REST- style, and its clients. Security at this level typically provides three services. First, the client and service need transport-level assurance that each is communicating with the other rather than with some impostor. Second, the data sent from one side to the other needs to be encrypted strongly enough so that an interceptor cannot decrypt the data and thus gain access to the secrets carried therein. Third, each side needs assurance that the received message is the same as the sent message. This chapter covers the basics of wire-level security with code examples.  Web services provide clients with access to resources. If a resource is secured, then a client needs the appropriate credentials to gain access. The credentials are pre- sented and verified through a process that usually has two phases. In the first phase, a client  user  presents information such as a username together with a credential such as a password. If the credential is not accepted, access to the requested re- source is denied. The first phase is known as user authentication. The second phase, which is optional, consists of fine-tuning the authenticated user’s access rights. For example, a stock-picking web service might provide all paying customers with a username and password, but the service might divide the customers into categories, for instance, regular and premier. Access to certain resources might be restricted to premier clients. The second phase is known as role authorization. This chapter introduces users-role security, a common name for the two-phase process, and the next chapter builds on the introduction.  193  Download at Boykma.Com   WS-Security  WS-Security, or WSS for short, is a collection of protocols that specify how different levels of security can be enforced on messaging in SOAP-based web services. For example, WSS specifies how digital signatures and encryption information can be inserted into SOAP headers. Recall that SOAP-based services are designed to be transport-neutral. Accordingly, WSS is meant to provide comprehensive end-to- end security regardless of the underlying transport. This chapter introduces WS- Security with an example published with Endpoint, and the next chapter builds on the introduction by examining WSS in an application server such as GlassFish.  Wire-Level Security Consider a pay-for web service such as Amazon’s S3 storage service. This service needs to authenticate requests to store and retrieve data so that only the paying clients have access to the service and that, moreover, a particular client has privileged access to its paid-for storage. In the RESTful version of S3, Amazon uses a customization of keyed HMAC  Hash Message Authentication Code  to authenticate client requests. Here is a summary of how the authentication works:    Parts of the request are concatenated together to form a single string, which be-  comes the input value for a hash computation. This string is the input message.    The AWS  Amazon Web Services  secret access key, a unique bit string that Am- azon provides to each paying client, is used to compute the hash value of the input message  see Figure 5-1 . A hash value is also called a message digest, which is a fixed-length digest of arbitrarily many input bits. Amazon uses the SHA-1  Secure Hash Algorithm-1  version of HMAC, which produces a 160-bit digest no matter what the bit length of the input may be. Amazon calls this hash value the signa- ture  because  the  value  functions  like  a  digital  signature,  although  technically  a digital signature is an encrypted message digest. What Amazon calls the signature is not encrypted.  Figure 5-1. A message digest  header.    The  Amazon  signature  is  added  to  the  request  in  the  HTTP  1.1  Authorization    Upon receipt of the request, the Amazon S3 first validates the Amazon signature  and then honors the request only if the validation succeeds.  What prevents a client’s request to Amazon S3 from being intercepted and the value of its Authorization header, the Amazon authentication signature, from being pirated?  194  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  N input bits  Message digest engine  Fixed-length digest of input bits  Download at Boykma.Com   Amazon assumes that the request is sent over the secure communications channel that HTTPS  HyperText Transport Protocol over Secure Socket Layer  provides. HTTPS is HTTP with an added security layer. Netscape did the original work in the design and implementation of this security layer and called it SSL  Secure Sockets Layer . The IETF  International Engineering Task Force  has taken over SSL and renamed it to TLS  Transport Layer Security . Although SSL and TLS differ in version numbers and in a few technical details, they are fundamentally the same. It is therefore common to use SSL, TLS, and SSL TLS interchangeably. Java has various packages that support SSL TLS in general and HTTPS in particular. JSSE  Java Secure Sockets Extension  has been part of core Java since JDK 1.4. Of interest here is that higher levels of security, such as user authentication, usually require wire-level security of the kind that HTTPS provides. Accordingly, the discussion of web services security begins with HTTPS.  HTTPS Basics HTTPS is easily the most popular among the secure versions of HTTP. HTTPS provides three critical security services over and above the transport services that HTTP provides. Following is a summary of the three, with Figure 5-2 as a reference. In the figure, Alice needs to send a secret message to Bob. Eve, however, may be eavesdropping. Eve may even try to dupe Alice and Bob into believing that they are communicating with one another when, in fact, each is communicating instead with Eve. This variation is known as the MITM  Man In The Middle  attack. For secure communications, Alice and Bob thus need these three services:  Peer authentication  Alice needs Bob to authenticate himself so that she is sure about who is on the receiving end before she sends the secret message. Bob, too, needs Alice to au- thenticate herself so that he knows that the secret message is from her rather than an impostor such as Eve. This step also is described as mutual authentication or mutual challenge.  Confidentiality  Integrity  Once Alice and Bob have authenticated each other, Alice needs to encrypt the secret message in such a way that only Bob can decrypt it. Even if Eve intercepts the encrypted message, she should not be able to decrypt the message because doing so requires enormous computational power or incredibly good luck.  The message that Alice sends should be identical to the one that Bob receives. If not, an error condition should be raised. The received message might differ from the sent one for various reasons; for instance, noise in the communications channel or deliberate tampering by Eve. Any difference between the sent and the received message should be detected.  Wire-Level Security  195  Download at Boykma.Com   Figure 5-2. A secret message from Bob to Alice despite Eve  These features can be implemented in different ways, of course. Before considering how HTTPS implements the three features, it will be useful to look briefly at data encryption and decryption.  Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption Decryption Modern  approaches  to  encryption  follow  two  different  approaches,  symmetric  and asymmetric. Under either approach, the bits to be encrypted  plain bits  are one input to an encryption engine and an encryption key is the other input  see Figure 5-3 . The encrypted bits are the cipher bits. If the input bits represent text, then they are the plaintext  and  the  output  bits  are  the  ciphertext.  The  cipher  bits  are  one  input  to the decryption engine, and a decryption key is the other input. The decryption produces the  original  plain  bits.  In  the  symmetric  approach,  the  same  key—called  the  secret key or the single key—is used to encrypt and decrypt  see Figure 5-4 . The symmetric approach has the advantage of being relatively fast, but the disadvantage of what is known as the key distribution problem. How is the secret key itself to be distributed to the sender and the receiver?  Figure 5-3. Basic encryption and decryption  Figure 5-4. Single key encryption and decryption  196  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Alice   sender   Bob   intended receiver   Eve   eavesdropper   Encryption key  Decryption key  Plain   unencrypted  bits  Encryption  engine  Cipher   encrypted  bits  Decryption  engine  Original plain bits  Plain bits  Encryption  Decryption  Plain bits  Single key  Cipher bits  Download at Boykma.Com   In the asymmetric approach, the starting point is a key pair, which consists of a private key and a public key. As the names suggest, the private key should not be distributed but safeguarded by whoever generated the key pair. The public key can be distributed freely and publicly. If message bits are encrypted with the public key, they can be de- crypted only with the private key, and vice-versa. Figure 5-5 illustrates. The asymmetric approach solves the key distribution problem, but asymmetric encryption and decryp- tion are roughly a thousand times slower than their symmetric counterparts.  Figure 5-5. Public key encryption and decryption  The public key approach solves the confidentiality problem for Alice and Bob. If Alice encrypts the message with the public key from Bob’s key pair, and Bob has the only copy of the private key from this pair, then only Bob can decrypt the message. Even if Eve intercepts Alice’s message, she cannot decrypt it with Bob’s public key.  How HTTPS Provides the Three Security Services Of  the  three  required  security  services—peer  authentication,  confidentiality,  and integrity—the last is the most straightforward. The message sent over HTTPS includes a digest, which the receiver recomputes. If the sent digest differs from the digest that the receiver computes, then the message was altered during transmission, either by accident or design. If the sent digest itself is altered during transmission, this likewise counts as integrity failure. HTTPS  handles  peer  authentication  through  the  exchange  of  digital  certificates.  In many cases, however, it is only the client that challenges the server. Consider a typical web application in which a shopper finalizes an order for the contents of his shopping cart by submitting a credit card number to the vendor. Here is a summary of what typically happens when the client-side browser and the web server negotiate to set up an HTTPS connection:    The customer’s browser challenges the vendor’s web server to authenticate itself, and the server responds by sending one or more digital certificates to the browser.   The browser checks the web server’s digital certificates against the browser’s trust- store,  which  is  a  database  of  digital  certificates  that  the  browser  trusts.  The  Wire-Level Security  197  Public key  Encryption  Plain bits  Private key  Decryption  Plain bits  Key pair  Cipher bits  Download at Boykma.Com   browser’s validation of an incoming certificate can be and, for practical reasons, typically is indirect. For example, suppose that the browser receives a certificate from Amazon but does not have such a certificate in its truststore. Suppose further that the Amazon certificate contains a vouching signature from VeriSign, a well- known certificate authority  CA . If the browser’s truststore has a VeriSign certif- icate, then the browser can use the VeriSign certificate to validate the VeriSign signature on the Amazon certificate. The point of interest is that the browser’s truststore is its repository of certificates that are used to verify incoming certificates. If the browser cannot validate an incoming certificate against its truststore, then the browser typically asks the user whether the certificate should be trusted this time only or permanently. If the user selects permanently, the browser adds the certificate to its truststore.    The web server typically does not challenge the browser. For one thing, the web application is interested in the shopper’s credit card rather than in the identity of the user agent  in this case, the browser  that the shopper happens to be using.  The usually one-sided authentication challenge, with the client challenging the server but not the other way around, shows up in Tomcat’s configuration file, server.xml. Here is the entry for HTTPS:  <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP 1.1" SSLEnabled="true"            maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"            clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"  >      The clientAuth attribute is set to false, thereby indicating that Tomcat does not chal- lenge the client. The default client behavior is to challenge the server. For authentication and confidentiality, HTTPS relies on digital certificates, which are widely used in public key cryptography precisely because the exchange of secret keys is so difficult among many users. Here is a summary of how HTTPS authentication is intertwined with HTTPS confidentiality. The process is sometimes described as the handshake between client and server that culminates in a secure network connection. In this scenario, the client might be a browser or an application functioning as a web service client. For convenience, the term web server covers both a standard web appli- cation server such as Tomcat, an Endpoint publisher of a web service, or a full-bodied Java Application Server such as BEA WebLogic, GlassFish, JBoss, or WebSphere:    The client challenges the web server, which sends one or more digital certificates as authentication. Modern digital certificates usually follow the X.509 format. The current X.509 version is named v3.    An X.509 certificate is a public key certificate that serves as an identity certificate by binding the public key from a key pair to an identity such as a person  for instance, Alice  or an organization  for instance, Bob’s employer . The certificate contains the digital signature of a CA such as a VeriSign, although certificates can be self- signed for testing purposes. In signing a digital certificate, a CA endorses the cer- tificate and thereby verifies that the certificate’s public key is bound to a particular  198  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com   identity. For instance, VeriSign signs Alice’s certificate and thereby verifies that the certificate’s public key belongs to Alice’s key pair.    The  client  can  determine  whether  to  accept  the  server’s  digital  certificates  by  checking these against its truststore.    The server has the option of challenging the client.   Once the challenge phase is over, the client begins the process of generating a secret key. The process begins with the client’s generation of a pre-master secret, a string, that is shared with the server. The pre-master is then used on each side to generate the same master secret key, which is used to encrypt and decrypt the traffic between the client and the server. At issue here is how the pre-master secret is sent securely from the client to the server.    The client encrypts the 48-bit pre-master secret with the server’s public key, avail- able on the server’s digital certificate downloaded during the peer authentication phase. The encrypted pre-master secret is sent to the server, which decrypts the secret. If everything is still in order, each side confirms that encryption of traffic between them is to begin. The public key private key pair is thus critical in solving the key distribution problem for secret keys.    At any point, either the client or the server may insist on starting the entire process all over again. For example, if either Alice or Bob suspects that Eve is up to no good, either Alice or Bob can restart the handshake process.  A secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt traffic for several reasons. First, symmetric encryption has relatively high performance. Second, if the server does not challenge the client, then the server does not have the client’s public key to encrypt messages to the client. The server cannot encrypt messages with its own private key, as any receiver  for instance, Eve  with access to the server’s public key then could decrypt the message. Finally, encrypting and decrypting with two separate key pairs is inherently trickier than using a single secret key. The challenge is to get the pre-master secret securely from the client to the server; and the server’s public key, available to the client in the server’s digital certificate after the mutual challenge phase, fits the bill perfectly. The master secret key is generated only after the client and the server have agreed upon which cipher suite, or set of crypto- graphic algorithms, should be used. A cipher suite includes a key-pair algorithm and a hash algorithm. Although digital certificates now play a dominant role in mutual challenge scenarios, they  are  not  the  only  game  in  town.  For  example,  SRP   Secure  Remote  Protocol  implements mutual challenge but without digital certificates. For more on SRP, see http:  srp.stanford.edu.

The HttpsURLConnection class, which extends HttpURLConnection, supports HTTPS connec- tions. The SunClient application shown below uses an HttpsURLConnection to issue a GET request under HTTPS against the Java home site. Note that the port number in the URL is 443, the standard port for HTTPS connections:  import java.net.URL; import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection; import java.net.MalformedURLException; import java.security.cert.Certificate; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.InputStreamReader;     Send a GET request over HTTPS to the Java home site and    display information about the security artifacts that come back. class SunClient {     private static final String url_s = "https:  java.sun.com:443";      public static void main String[ ] args  {         new SunClient  .do_it  ;     }     private void do_it   {         try {             URL url = new URL url_s ;             HttpsURLConnection conn =  HttpsURLConnection  url.openConnection  ;             conn.setDoInput true ;             conn.setRequestMethod "GET" ;             conn.connect  ;             dump_features conn ;         }         catch MalformedURLException e  { System.err.println e ; }         catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; }     }     private void dump_features HttpsURLConnection conn  {         try {             print "Status code:  " + conn.getResponseCode   ;             print "Cipher suite: " + conn.getCipherSuite   ;             Certificate[ ] certs = conn.getServerCertificates  ;             for  Certificate cert : certs  {                 print "\tCert. type: " + cert.getType   ;                 print "\tHash code:  " + cert.hashCode   ;                 print "\tAlgorithm:  " + cert.getPublicKey  .getAlgorithm   ;                 print "\tFormat:     " + cert.getPublicKey  .getFormat   ;                 print "" ;             }         }         catch Exception e  { System.err.println e ; }     }     private void print String s  { System.out.println s ; } }       200  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com   Here is the output from a sample run:  Status code:  200 Cipher suite: SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5         Cert. type: X.509         Hash code:  23073427         Algorithm:  RSA         Format:     X.509          Cert. type: X.509         Hash code:  32560810         Algorithm:  RSA         Format:     X.509          Cert. type: X.509         Hash code:  8222443         Algorithm:  RSA         Format:     X.509        The status code of 200 signals that the GET request was successful. The SSL cipher suite can be read as follows:  RSA  RC4_128  MD5  This  is  the  public  key  cryptography  algorithm,  named  after  Rivest,  Shamir,  and Adleman, the former MIT professors who designed it. RSA is the most commonly used public key algorithm. It is used to encrypt the pre-master that is sent from the client to the server.  The stream cipher algorithm, which is used to encrypt and decrypt the bit traffic between client and server, has a key length of 128 bits. The R is for Rivest in RSA, and the C is for cipher.  Sometimes RC is said to be shorthand for Ron’s Code, as Rivest’s  first  name  is  Ron.   RC4  is  the  most  commonly  used  stream  cipher. RC4_128 is used to encrypt the data traffic once the handshake is completed.  The certificate’s 128-bit identifying hash, also called its fingerprint, is generated with the Message Digest algorithm 5. MD5 supplies what is officially known as the cryptographic hash function. Rivest designed MD5 as an improvement over MD4. Although MD5 is not fatally flawed, it is gradually losing ground to alternatives such as the Secure Hash Algorithm  SHA  family of hash algorithms.  The Sun server sent three digital certificates during the mutual challenge phase. Each is an X.509 certificate generated with the RSA algorithm. Each of the distinct MD5 digests is 128 bits in length. The format of each X.509 certificate understandably follows the X.509 specification. The three X.509 digital certificates sent to the SunClient application can be validated against the client’s default truststore, which is JAVA_HOME jre lib security cacerts. In development phase, however, it may be useful to turn off validation because, for ex- ample, the truststore has does not contain the appropriate certificates.

A trust manager validates certificates. The output for the  SunClient and the output for the SunTrustingClient is essentially the same, however, because even the trusting version still receives three certificates from the Sun server.  Securing the RabbitCounter Service The Endpoint.publish method does not support HTTPS connections. However, core Java 6 includes an HttpServer class and its subclass HttpsServer, which can be used to publish a service under HTTPS.  The Endpoint publisher, in fact, uses the HttpServer class under the hood.  The HttpsServer can be used by itself to publish a RESTful service such as the RabbitCounter.

try {    InetSocketAddress inet = new InetSocketAddress port ;    server = HttpsServer.create inet, 5 ;  The second argument to create, in this case 5, is the maximum number of requests that should be queued. A value of 0 signals that the system default should be used. The code to configure an HttpsServer is trickier than the code to create one. There are several important features of the configuration, which centers on an SSLContext that is associated with a specific protocol such as TLS. In this example, the SSLContext is used for two configurations. The first configuration manages the keystore and truststore. Recall that the keystore, on the server side, contains the server’s digital certificates that can be sent to the client during peer authentication; on the client side, the keystore contains the client’s digital certificates for the same purpose. There is no default key- store. Here is the command used to generate the keystore file rc.keystore  the name is arbitrary :  % keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore rc.keystore   The command creates a single self-signed X.509 certificate and places this certificate in the file rc.keystore. The keytool utility, which comes with core Java 6, prompts for information that is used to build the X.509 certificate. The utility also asks for a pass- word, in this case qubits. At runtime the keystore’s contents will be loaded into the application so that, during the TLS handshake, any digital certificates therein can be sent to the client. Next, the truststore, the database of trusted digital certificates, is configured.  Recall that there is a default truststore: JAVA_HOME jre lib security cacerts.  Once the key- store and truststore configuration is ready, the statement:  ssl_ctx.init kmf.getKeyManagers  , tmf.getTrustManagers  , null ;  makes these configurations part of the SSLContext. The third argument above, null, signals that the system should use the default SecureRandom number generator. The keystore and truststore configuration also could be done through -D command-line options or by setting various system properties in the code. The last configuration step is to use the SSLContext to get an SSLEngine, which in turn provides the protocols and cipher suites available for establishing a secure connection. In this example, the system defaults are taken and no additional protocols or cipher suites are added to the already available mix. The last setup step before starting the server is to establish an HttpContext, which con- sists of a path  in this case,  fibs  and an HttpHandler whose handle method is called back on every request for the resource at  fibs. The handler is associated with the HttpsServer. In effect, the HTTPS server delegates request processing to the specified  Securing the RabbitCounter Service  207  Download at Boykma.Com   handle method. An elaborate HttpsServer might have many HttpContext instances and separate handlers for each. Here is the MyHttpHandler’s implementation of the HttpHandler method handle:  public void handle HttpExchange ex  {      String verb = ex.getRequestMethod  .toUpperCase  ;      if  verb.equals "GET"           doGet ex ;      else if  verb.equals "POST"     doPost ex ;      else if  verb.equals "DELETE"   doDelete ex ;      else throw new HTTPException 405 ;    bad verb }  The HttpExchange argument encapsulates methods to access an input stream, which can be used to read client POST requests, and an output stream, which can be used to generate the body of a response to the client. There are methods to set the response’s status code and the like. For example, here is the respond_to_client method that han- dles responses to GET, POST, and DELETE requests:  private void respond_to_client HttpExchange ex, String res  {     try {         ex.sendResponseHeaders 200, 0 ;    0 means: arbitrarily many bytes         OutputStream out = ex.getResponseBody  ;         out.write res.getBytes   ;         out.flush  ;         ex.close  ;    closes all streams     }     catch IOException e  { System.err.println e ; } }  The HTTPS client against the HTTPS RabbitCounter service differs only slightly from the SunClient and the SunTrustingClient shown earlier. An HttpsURLConnection is used again and, for simplicity, is configured not to check the digital certificates sent from the server. The one change involves a  HostnameVerifier, which allows the client to decide explicitly about whether it is all right to set up an HTTPS connection with a specified  server.  Here  is  the  code  segment,  with  conn  as  the  reference  to  the HttpsURLConnection object:  conn.setHostnameVerifier new HostnameVerifier   {           public boolean verify String host, SSLSession sess  {               if  host.equals "localhost"   return true;               else return false;           }} ;  The verify method can be coded to handle whatever connection logic is appropriate to the application. In this case, HTTPS connections to a server running on localhost are  allowed,  but  attempted  connections  to  any  other  server  result  in  an  exception.

The key- tool utility allows other cipher suites to be specified. As proof of concept, here is a Perl client invoked against the RabbitCounter service after the Java client has posted the values shown previously:  ! usr bin perl -w  use Net::SSLeay qw get_https ; use strict;  my  $type, $start_line, $misc, $extra  = get_https 'localhost', 9876, ' fib' ; print "Type value:  $type\n"; print "Start line:  $start_line\n"; print "Misc:        $misc => $extra\n";  By default, the Perl client does not verify the server’s certificates, although this feature can be turned on easily. The Perl function get_https returns a list of four items. The output was:  Type value:  a [2, 5, 13]  Start line:  HTTP 1.1 200 OK Misc:        TRANSFER-ENCODING => chunked  In the first line, the character a indicates that the service returns an array.  Adding User Authentication To begin, here is a quick review of the jargon introduced earlier. User authentication is the first phase in a two-phase process known popularly as users-roles security. In the first  phase,  a  user  presents  credentials  such  as  a  password  in  order  to  become  an authenticated subject. More sophisticated credentials such as a smart card or biometric data  from, for instance, a fingerprint or even a retinal scan  might be used in user authentication. The second phase, authorization, is optional and normally occurs only if the first phase succeeds. This phase determines which authorization roles an authenticated subject may play. Authorization roles can be customized as needed. For instance, Unix-based operating systems distinguish between users and superusers, which are authorization roles that determine levels of access to system resources and which privileged actions accompany a role. An IT organization might have authorization roles such as program- mer, senior database administrator, software engineer, systems analyst, and so on. In large organizations, digital certificates may be used to determine authorization roles. For example, a system based on users-roles security may require Fred Flintstone to provide his username and password to become an authenticated subject but then check a database for a certificate that authorizes Fred as a crane operator.  Securing the RabbitCounter Service  211  Download at Boykma.Com   HTTP BASIC Authentication With a few minor changes, the RabbitCounter service can support what is known as HTTP BASIC Authentication. JAX-WS provides two convenient constants to look up usernames and passwords. The changes are local to the HttpHandler implementation. The handle method now invokes the authenticate method, which throws an HTTP 401  Unauthorized  exception if the authentication fails and otherwise does nothing. See Example 5-1.  Example 5-1. Adding basic authentication to the RabbitCounter service  public void handle HttpExchange ex  {     authenticate ex ;     String verb = ex.getRequestMethod  .toUpperCase  ;     if  verb.equals "GET"           doGet ex ;     else if  verb.equals "POST"     doPost ex ;     else if  verb.equals "DELETE"   doDelete ex ;     else throw new HTTPException 405 ; }  private void authenticate HttpExchange ex  {        Extract the header entries.     Headers headers = ex.getRequestHeaders  ;     List  ulist = headers.get BindingProvider.USERNAME_PROPERTY ;     List  plist = headers.get BindingProvider.PASSWORD_PROPERTY ;         Extract username password from the two singleton lists.     String username = ulist.get 0 ;     String password = plist.get 0 ;     if  !username.equals "fred"   !password.equals "rockbed"           throw new HTTPException 401 ;    authentication error }  In production mode, of course, the username and password might be checked against a database. This change to the source also requires two additional import statements, one for BindingProvider and another for Headers. On the client side, the change is also minor. The username and password are added to the HTTP request before the connect method is invoked on the HttpsURLConnection. In this code segment, conn is the reference to the HttpsURLConnection instance:  conn.addRequestProperty BindingProvider.USERNAME_PROPERTY, "fred" ; conn.addRequestProperty BindingProvider.PASSWORD_PROPERTY, "rockbed" ;  The key point is that the authentication information is sent to the RabbitCounter service with wire-level security, in particular data encryption.  Container-Managed Security for Web Services This most recent version of the RabbitCounter service does provide user authentication, but not in a way that scales. A better approach would be to use a web service container  212  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com   that provides not only user authentication but also wire-level security. Tomcat, the reference  implementation  for  a  Java  web  container,  can  provide  both.  Chapter  4 showed how Tomcat can be used to publish RESTful web services as servlets. Tomcat also can publish SOAP-based services. Tomcat can publish either a @WebService or a @WebServiceProvider. The example to illustrate how Tomcat provides container-managed security is built in two steps. The first step publishes a SOAP-based service with Tomcat, and the second step adds security. A later example is a secured @WebServiceProvider under Tomcat.  Deploying a @WebService Under Tomcat The  SOAP-based  service  is  organized  in  the  usual  way.  Here  is  the  code  for  the TempConvert SEI:  package ch05.tc; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod;  @WebService public interface TempConvert {     @WebMethod float c2f float c ;     @WebMethod float f2c float f ; }  And here is the code for the corresponding SIB:  package ch05.tc; import javax.jws.WebService;  @WebService endpointInterface = "ch05.tc.TempConvert"  public class TempConvertImpl implements TempConvert {     public float c2f float t  { return 32.0f +  t * 9.0f   5.0f ; }     public float f2c float t  { return  5.0f   9.0f  *  t - 32.0f ; } }  For  deployment  under  Tomcat,  the  service  requires  a  deployment  descriptor,  the web.xml file. This configuration file informs the servlet container about how requests for the service are to be handled. In particular, the web.xml refers to two special classes that come with JAX-WS 2.1: WSServlet and WSServletContainerListener. This segment of the web.xml:        TempConvertWS            com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServlet             TempConvertWS      tc     Container-Managed Security for Web Services   213  Download at Boykma.Com   delegates requests whose URLs end with the path  tc to a WSServlet instance, which in turn is linked to the JWS runtime. Tomcat provides the WSServlet instance. The web.xml segment:             com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServletContextListener        specifies a WSServletContextListener instance that will parse a second, Sun-specific configuration file named sun-jaxws.xml, which provides the web service’s endpoint by connecting the WSServlet instance to the service’s implementation class. Here is the sun-jaxws.xml file:        <endpoint      name="TempConvertWS"      implementation="ch05.tc.TempConvertImpl"      url-pattern=" tc" >          The name TempConvertWS is the name of the WSSerlvet in the web.xml file. As the syntax indicates, the configuration file could specify multiple service endpoints but, in this case, specifies only one. In the deployed WAR file, the web.xml and sun-jaxws.xml files reside in the WEB- INF directory. For reference, here is the entire web.xml file:    <web-app      xmlns="http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee"      xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"      xsi:schemaLocation="http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee                          http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee web-app_2_4.xsd"      version="2.4">                     com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServletContextListener                         TempConvertWS                  com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServlet                         TempConvertWS         tc                214  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com   The service is deployed as if it were a standard Tomcat web application. Copies of the compiled SEI and SIB need to reside in the WEB-INF classes ch05 tc directory, and the two configuration files need to reside in the WEB-INF directory. Note that the service is, by default, document-literal; hence, the wsgen utility can be run:  % wsgen -cp . WEB-INF.classes.ch05.tc.TempConvertImpl        to generate the required JAX-B artifacts. The WAR file, whose name is arbitrary, is then built:  % jar cvf tempc.war WEB-INF  and copied to the TOMCAT_HOME webapps directory for deployment. The success of the deployment can be confirmed by checking a Tomcat log file or by opening a browser to the URL http:  localhost:8080 tempc tc?wsdl. The wsimport utility now can be employed in the usual way to generate client-side artifacts from the WSDL:  % wsimport -keep -p tcClient http:  localhost:8080 tempc tc?wsdl  Here is a sample client, ClientTC, coded with the wsimport artifacts:  import tcClient.TempConvertImplService; import tcClient.TempConvert;  class ClientTC {    public static void main String args[ ]  throws Exception {        TempConvertImplService service = new TempConvertImplService  ;        TempConvert port = service.getTempConvertImplPort  ;         System.out.println "f2c -40.1  ==> " + port.f2C -40.1f  ;        System.out.println "c2f -40.1  ==> " + port.c2F -40.1f  ;        System.out.println "f2c +98.7  ==> " + port.f2C +98.7f  ;    } }  The output is:  f2c -40.1  ==> -40.055557 c2f -40.1  ==> -40.18 f2c +98.7  ==> 37.055557  Securing the @WebService Under Tomcat The TempConvert service does not need to be changed at all. This is the obvious benefit of having the container, Tomcat, rather than the application manage the security. The first step is to ensure that the Tomcat connector for SSL TLS is enabled. A connector is  an  endpoint  for  client  requests.  In  the  main  Tomcat  configuration  file  conf  server.xml, the section:  <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP 1.1" SSLEnabled="true" maxThreads="150"             scheme="https" secure="true" clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"  >  Container-Managed Security for Web Services   215  Download at Boykma.Com   may have to be uncommented. If the section is commented out, then Tomcat has to be restarted after the editing change. By default, Tomcat awaits HTTPS requests on port 8443, although this port number can be changed. When a client sends an HTTPS request to Tomcat, Tomcat will need a digital certificate to send back during the mutual challenge phase. The command:  % keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA  generates a self-signed certificate. The keytool utility will prompt for various pieces of information, including a password, which should be set to changeit because this is what Tomcat expects. By default, the certificate is placed in a file named .keystore in the user’s home directory, although the  -keystore option can be used with the  keytool utility to specify a different file name for the keystore. On the local system, the user account that starts Tomcat needs to have a keystore file in the account’s home directory. However, the Tomcat configuration file server.xml also can specify the location of the keystore file—and this seems the safest choice. Here is the amended entry for the HTTPS entry on my machine:  <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP 1.1" SSLEnabled="true" maxThreads="150"             scheme="https" secure="true" clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"             keystoreFile=" home mkalin .keystore"  >  Tomcat now can be restarted and tested by entering the URL https:  localhost:8443 in a browser. Because the browser does not have the newly minted, self-signed certificate in its own truststore, the browser will prompt about whether to accept the certificate and, if so, whether to accept it permanently; that is, as an addition to the browser’s truststore. Once the browser receives all of the required yes answers, it will display the Tomcat home page. On the client side, the ClientTC application needs to be modified slightly. This client uses the wsimport-generated artifacts, in particular the class tcClient.TempConvertImpl Service, which has the endpoint URL set to http:  localhost:8080 tempc tc?wsdl. There is no reason to change the endpoint, as the WSDL document is still available at this URL. Yet the client needs to connect to https:  localhost:8443 rather than http:  local host:8080. The adjustment can be made in the client code using the BindingProvider. Here is the revised client:  import tcClient.TempConvertImplService; import tcClient.TempConvert; import javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider; import java.util.Map;  class ClientTCSecure {     private static final String endpoint = "https:  localhost:8443 tempc tc";     public static void main String args[ ]  {         TempConvertImplService service = new TempConvertImplService  ;         TempConvert port = service.getTempConvertImplPort  ;          Map  req_ctx =   BindingProvider  port .getRequestContext  ;         req_ctx.put BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY, endpoint ;  216  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com           System.out.println "f2c -40.1  ==> " + port.f2C -40.1f  ;         System.out.println "c2f -40.1  ==> " + port.c2F -40.1f  ;         System.out.println "f2c +98.7  ==> " + port.f2C +98.7f  ;     } }  By default, Tomcat does not challenge the client during the peer authentication phase, but this could change. The client, in any case, cannot count on not being challenged and so must have a keystore with an identifying digital certificate. Further, the client needs a truststore against which to compare the certificate from Tomcat. Although the keystore and the truststore serve different purposes, each is a database of certificates with the same file format. To simplify the example, the Tomcat keystore will do triple duty by serving as the client keystore and truststore as well. The point of interest is the security architecture rather than the particular truststores and keystores. Here is the command to invoke the client, with the -D options to set the keystore and truststore information:  % java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore= home mkalin .keystore \        -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit       \        -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore= home mkalin .keystore   \        -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=changeit ClientTC  The command is sufficiently complicated that an Ant or equivalent script might be used in production. The output is the same as before, of course.  Application-Managed Authentication The next step in securing the TempConvert service is to add authentication and author- ization. These additions can be done at the application level  that is, in the web service code itself  or at the container level by using shared resources such as a database of usernames and passwords. Container-managed authentication has the obvious appeal of letting Tomcat handle all of the security so that the service can focus on application logic. Container-managed authentication leads to cleaner code by adhering to the AOP practice  of  having  the  container—rather  than  the  many  different  applications  it contains—provide the security aspect. Authentication at the application level does not involve much code but does muddy up  the  code  with  a  mix  of  security  concerns  and  business  logic.  Perhaps  the  most straightforward approach at the application level is to follow the idiom shown earlier in Example 5-1 by passing the username and password as part of the request context. Here is the revised ClientTC code:  import tcClient.TempConvertImplService; import tcClient.TempConvert; import javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import java.util.Map; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Collections;  Container-Managed Security for Web Services   217  Download at Boykma.Com   import java.util.List;  class ClientTC {     private static final String endpoint = "https:  localhost:8443 tempc tc";      public static void main String args[ ]  {         TempConvertImplService service = new TempConvertImplService  ;         TempConvert port = service.getTempConvertImplPort  ;          Map  req_ctx =   BindingProvider  port .getRequestContext  ;         req_ctx.put BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY, endpoint ;             Place the username password in the HTTP request headers,            which a non-Java client can do as well.         Map > hdr = new HashMap >  ;         hdr.put "Username", Collections.singletonList "fred"  ;         hdr.put "Password", Collections.singletonList "rockbed"  ;         req_ctx.put MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS, hdr ;             Invoke service methods.         System.out.println "f2c -40.1  ==> " + port.f2C -40.1f  ;         System.out.println "c2f -40.1  ==> " + port.c2F -40.1f  ;         System.out.println "f2c +98.7  ==> " + port.f2C +98.7f  ;     } }  The revised ClientTC now places the username and password in the HTTP headers to underscore that there is nothing Java-specific in this approach. For clarity, the username and  password  are  hardcoded,  although  they  presumably  would  be  entered  as command-line arguments. The change to the TempConvert service is also relatively minor. The additional method authenticated checks the username and password. In production, of course, the check would likely go against values stored in a database:  package ch05.tc;  import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.annotation.Resource; import javax.xml.ws.WebServiceContext; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import javax.xml.ws.http.HTTPException; import java.util.Map; import java.util.List;  @WebService endpointInterface = "ch05.tc.TempConvert"  public class TempConvertImpl implements TempConvert {     @Resource     WebServiceContext ws_ctx;      public float c2f float t  {         if  authenticated    return 32.0f +  t * 9.0f   5.0f ;         else throw new HTTPException 401 ;    authorization error     }  218  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com       public float f2c float t  {         if  authenticated    return  5.0f   9.0f  *  t - 32.0f ;         else throw new HTTPException 401 ;    authorization error     }      private boolean authenticated   {         MessageContext mctx = ws_ctx.getMessageContext  ;         Map http_headers =  Map  mctx.get MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS ;         List ulist =  List  http_headers.get "Username" ;         List plist =  List  http_headers.get "Password" ;             proof of concept authentication         if  ulist.contains "fred"  && plist.contains "rockbed"   return true;         else return false;     } }  The downside of handling the authentication in the application code is evident. The web service operations, in this case f2c and c2f, are now a mix of application logic and security processing, however minor in this example. The authenticated method needs to access the MessageContext, the kind of low-level processing best left to handlers. The example is small enough that the mix is not overwhelming, but the example likewise suggests how complicated the intermix of application logic and security could become in a real-world service. Further, this approach does not scale well. If Fred needs to access other services that require authentication, then these services will have to replicate the kind of code shown here. An attractive option to the approach taken in this example is to let the container handle the authentication.  Container-Managed Authentication and Authorization Tomcat provides container-managed authentication and authorization. The concept of a realm plays a central role in the Tomcat approach. A realm is a collection of re- sources, including web pages and web services, with a designated authentication and authorization facility. The Tomcat documentation describes a realm as being akin to a Unix group with respect to access rights. A realm is an organizational tool that allows a collection of resources to be under a single policy for access control. Tomcat provides five standard plugins, with Realm in the names, to manage commu- nications between the container and authentication authorization store. Here are the five plugins with a short description of each:  JDBCRealm  DataSourceRealm  The authentication information is stored in a relational database accessible through a standard Java JDBC driver.  The authentication information again is stored in a relational database and acces- sible through a Java JDBC DataSource, which in turn is available through a JNDI  Java Naming and Directory Interface  lookup service.  Container-Managed Security for Web Services   219  Download at Boykma.Com   JNDIRealm  MemoryRealm  JAASRealm  The authentication information is stored in an LDAP-based  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  directory service, which is available through a JNDI provider.  The authentication information is read into the container at startup from the file conf tomcat-users.xml. This is the simplest choice and the default.  The authentication information is available through a JAAS  Java Authentication and Authorization Service  provider, which in turn is available in a Java Application Server such as BEA WebLogic, GlassFish, JBoss, or WebSphere.  Under any of these choices, it is the Tomcat container rather than the application that becomes the security provider.  Configuring Container-Managed Security Under Tomcat The Tomcat approach to security also is declarative rather than programmatic; that is, details about the security realm are specified in a configuration file rather than in code. The configuration file is the web.xml document included in the deployed WAR file. Here is the web.xml for the next revision to the TempConvert service, which uses the Tomcat MemoryRealm:    <web-app xmlns="http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee"          xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"          xsi:schemaLocation="http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee                         http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee web-app_2_4.xsd" version="2.4">                     com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServletContextListener                         TempConvertWS                  com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServlet                          The Only Secure Role        bigshot                              Users-Roles Security            tcauth           220  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com                    bigshot                             CONFIDENTIAL                            BASIC                   TempConvertWS         tcauth          In the revised web.xml, there are four points of interest:    The resources to be secured are specified as a web-resource-collection. In this case, the collection includes any resource available through the path  tcauth, which is the path to TempConvert service deployed in a WAR file. The security thus covers the service’s two encapsulated operations, f2c and c2f. This path likewise includes the WSDL, as the URL for the WSDL ends with the path  tcauth?wsdl.    Access to resources on the path  tcauth is restricted to authenticated users in the role of bigshot. If Fred is to invoke, say, the f2c method, then Fred must have a valid username password and be authorized to play the role of bigshot.    The HTTP authentication method is BASIC rather than one of the other standard HTTP methods: DIGEST, FORM, and CLIENT-CERT. Each of these will be clari- fied shortly. The term authorization is used here in the broad sense to cover both user authentication and role authorization.    The transport is guaranteed to be CONFIDENTIAL, which covers the standard HTTPS services of peer authentication, data encryption, and message integrity. If a user tried to access the resource through an HTTP-based URL such as http:  localhost: 8080 tc tcauth, Tomcat would then redirect this request to the HTTPS-based URL https:  localhost:8443 tc tcauth.   The  redirect  URL  is  one  of  the  configuration points specified in conf server.xml.   The web.xml configuration allows settings per HTTP verb, if needed. For example, tight security could be set on POST requests, but security could be lifted altogether for GET requests. The web service implementation is straightforward:  package ch05.tcauth;  import javax.jws.WebService;  @WebService endpointInterface = "ch05.tcauth.TempConvertAuth"   Container-Managed Security for Web Services   221  Download at Boykma.Com   public class TempConvertAuthImpl implements TempConvertAuth {     public float c2f float t  { return 32.0f +  t * 9.0f   5.0f ; }     public float f2c float t  { return  5.0f   9.0f  *  t - 32.0f ; } }  Equally straightforward is this sample client against the service:  import tcauthClient.TempConvertAuthImplService; import tcauthClient.TempConvertAuth; import javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider;  class ClientAuth {     public static void main String args[ ]  {         TempConvertAuthImplService service = new TempConvertAuthImplService  ;         TempConvertAuth port = service.getTempConvertAuthImplPort  ;         BindingProvider prov =  BindingProvider  port;          prov.getRequestContext  .put BindingProvider.USERNAME_PROPERTY, "fred" ;         prov.getRequestContext  .put BindingProvider.PASSWORD_PROPERTY, "rockbed" ;          System.out.println "f2c -40.1  ==> " + port.f2C -40.1f  ;         System.out.println "c2f -40.1  ==> " + port.c2F -40.1f  ;         System.out.println "f2c +98.7  ==> " + port.f2C +98.7f  ;     } }  There is one tricky aspect to the client: the use of the wsimport utility to generate the artifacts in the tcauthClient package. The problem is that the web service’s WSDL is also secured and therefore requires authentication for access. There are workarounds, of course. One option is to generate the WSDL locally by using the wsgen utility on the SIB. Another option is to get the WSDL from a nonsecure version of the service. The locally saved WSDL and its XSD are then fed into wsimport to generate the artifacts. The client application ClientAuth uses the BindingProvider constants as keys for the username and password. Tomcat expects the lookup keys for the username and pass- word to be the strings:  javax.xml.ws.security.auth.username javax.xml.ws.security.auth.password  These are the values of the BindingProvider constant USERNAME_PROPERTY and the con- stant PASSWORD_PROPERTY, respectively. When Tomcat receives the request for the secured resource, Tomcat knows from the WAR file’s configuration document, web.xml, that the requester needs to be authen- ticated and authorized. Tomcat then checks the submitted username and the associated password credential against data stored in the default MemoryRealm, which contains the usernames,  passwords,  and  authorization  roles  from  the  file  conf tomcat-users.xml. Here is the file for this example:               222  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com              Using a Digested Password Instead of a Password In addition to BASIC authentication, HTTP 1.1 also supports DIGEST, FORM, and CLIENT-CERT authentication. The FORM method of authentication is the best prac- tice in browser-based web applications. The gist is that the web application itself rather than the browser provides the input form for a username and a password. The CLIENT- CERT method, of course, authenticates the client with a digital certificate but encoun- ters serious practical problems. Imagine, for example, that a client has a good certificate on one machine but unexpectedly must access the secured website from a different machine, which does not have a copy of the certificate. Tomcat also supports the DIGEST method of authentication. A careful user will be understandably concerned about having a copy of a password on a remote host, in this case the machine that hosts the secured web service. If the remote host is compromised, so is the user’s password. A digest of the password avoids this problem so long as the digest is generated with a one-way hash function; that is, a function that is easy to compute but hard to invert. For example, given the digest of a password and the algo- rithm used to compute the digest  for instance, MD5 or SHA-1 , it is still a computa- tionally intractable task to derive the original password from the digest produced by a one-way hash function used in MD5 or SHA-1. Switching  from  BASIC  to  DIGEST  authentication  is  not  hard.  Technically,  the web.xml entry:        BASIC     should be changed to:        DIGEST     and a comparable change should be made in the conf tomcat-users.xml file for a web service secured with the MemoryRealm, as in this example. However, there is a simpler approach that can be summarized as follows:    Tomcat  provides  a  digest  utility,  in  TOMCAT_HOME bin,  that  can  be  used  to generate message digests using the standard algorithms such as MD5 and SHA. Here is the command to digest Fred’s password rockbed:  % digest.sh -a SHA rockbed  There is a digest.bat for Windows. The output is a 20-byte digest, in this case:  4b177c8995e6b0fa796581ac191f256545f0b8c5  Container-Managed Security for Web Services   223  Download at Boykma.Com     The  digested  password  now  replaces  the  password  in  tomcat-users.xml,  which  becomes:                    <user username="fred"          password="4b177c8995e6b0fa796581ac191f256545f0b8c5" roles="bigshot" >      A client such as Fred now needs to generate the same digest. Tomcat provides a RealmBase.Digest method, which the Tomcat digest utility uses. Here is the revised client:  import tcauthClient.TempConvertAuthImplService; import tcauthClient.TempConvertAuth; import javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider; import org.apache.catalina.realm.RealmBase;     Revised to send a digested password. class ClientAuth {     public static void main String args[ ]  {         TempConvertAuthImplService service = new TempConvertAuthImplService  ;         TempConvertAuth port = service.getTempConvertAuthImplPort  ;         BindingProvider prov =  BindingProvider  port;          String digest = RealmBase.Digest "rockbed",    password                                          "SHA",        digest algorithm                                          null ;        default char. encoding          prov.getRequestContext  .put BindingProvider.USERNAME_PROPERTY, "fred" ;         prov.getRequestContext  .put BindingProvider.PASSWORD_PROPERTY, digest ;          System.out.println "f2c -40.1  ==> " + port.f2C -40.1f  ;         System.out.println "c2f -40.1  ==> " + port.c2F -40.1f  ;         System.out.println "f2c +98.7  ==> " + port.f2C +98.7f  ;     } }  The revised client needs to be executed with the JAR files bin tomcat-juli.jar and lib catalina.jar on the classpath. The compiler needs only the catalina.jar file on the classpath.  Sending a digested password in place of the real thing requires only a little extra work.  A Secured @WebServiceProvider Tomcat can deploy both a @WebService and a @WebServiceProvider. Here is the revised TempConvert but now as a RESTful service:  224  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com   package ch05.authrest;  import javax.xml.ws.Provider; import javax.xml.transform.Source; import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource; import javax.annotation.Resource; import javax.xml.ws.BindingType; import javax.xml.ws.WebServiceContext; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import javax.xml.ws.http.HTTPException; import javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider; import javax.xml.ws.http.HTTPBinding; import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream; import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream; import java.beans.XMLEncoder; import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList;  @WebServiceProvider @BindingType value = HTTPBinding.HTTP_BINDING  public class TempConvertR implements Provider  {     @Resource     protected WebServiceContext ws_ctx;      public Source invoke Source request  {            Grab the message context and extract the request verb.

The code implements only application logic. The web.xml and sun-jaxws.xml deployment files are are not changed in any important way. The  revised  client  against  the  @WebServiceProvider  takes  the  same  approach  as  the original client against the @WebService—the username and digested password are in- serted into the request context with the keys that Tomcat expects:  import javax.xml.namespace.QName; import javax.xml.ws.Service; import javax.xml.ws.Dispatch; import javax.xml.ws.http.HTTPBinding; import org.xml.sax.InputSource; import javax.xml.xpath.XPath; import javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory; import javax.xml.transform.Source; import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider; import org.apache.catalina.realm.RealmBase;  class DispatchClientTC {     public static void main String[ ] args  throws Exception {         QName service_name = new QName "TempConvert" ;         QName port_name = new QName "TempConvertPort" ;         String endpoint = "https:  localhost:8443 tempcR authRest";             Now create a service proxy or dispatcher.

Figure 5-6. The WS-Security specifications  The layered blocks above WS-Security in Figure 5-6 can be clarified briefly as follows. The first layer consists of WS-Policy, WS-Trust, and WS-Privacy. The second layer of WS-SecureConversation, WS-Federation, and WS-Authorization builds upon this first layer. The architecture is thus modular but also complicated. Here is a short description of each specification, starting with the first layer:  WS-Security  227  WS-Secure Conversation  WS-Federation  WS-Authorization  WS-Policy  WS-Trust  WS-Privacy  WS-Security  SOAP  Download at Boykma.Com   WS-Policy  WS-Trust  WS-Privacy  This specification describes general security capabilities, constraints, and policies. For example, a WS-Policy assertion could stipulate that a message requires security tokens or that a particular encryption algorithm be used.  This specification deals primarily with how security tokens are to be issued, re- newed,  and  validated.  In  general,  the  specification  covers  broker  trust  relation- ships, which are illustrated later in a code example.  This specification explains how services can state and enforce privacy policies. The specification also covers how a service can determine whether a requester intends to follow such policies.  WS-SecureConversation  This specification covers, as the name indicates, secure web service conversations across different sites and, therefore, across different security contexts and trust domains. The specification focuses on how a security context is created and how security keys are derived and exchanged.  WS-Federation  This specification addresses the challenge of managing security identities across different platforms and organizations. At the heart of the challenge is how to main- tain a single, authenticated identity  for example, Alice’s security identity  in a heterogeneous security environment.  WS-Authorization  This specification covers the management of authorization data such as security tokens and underlying policies for granting access to secured resources.  WS-Security is often associated with federated security in the broad sense, which has the goal of cleanly separating web service logic from the high-level security concerns, in  particular  authentication authorization,  that  challenge  web  service  deployment. This separation of concerns is meant to ease collaboration across computer systems and trust realms. Recall that SOAP-based web services are meant to be transport-neutral. Accordingly, SOAP-based services cannot depend simply on the reliable transport that HTTP and HTTPS provide, although most SOAP messages are transported over HTTP. HTTP and HTTPS rest on TCP IP  Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol , which supports reliable messaging. What if TCP IP infrastructure is not available? The WS- ReliableMessaging specification addresses precisely the issue of delivering SOAP-based services over unreliable infrastructure. A SOAP-based service cannot rely on the authentication authorization support that a web container such as Tomcat or an application server such as BEA WebLogic, JBoss, GlassFish, or WebSphere may provide. The WS-Security specifications therefore ad- dress issues of high-level security as part of SOAP itself rather than as the part of the  228  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com   infrastructure that happens to be in place for a particular SOAP-based service. The goals of WS-Security are often summarized with the phrase end-to-end security, which means that security matters are not delegated to the transport level but rather handled directly through an appropriate security API. A framework for end-to-end security needs to cover the situation in which a message is routed through intermediaries, each of which may have to process the message, before reaching the ultimate receiver. Accordingly, end-to-end  security  focuses  on  message  content  rather  than  on  the  underlying transport.  Securing a @WebService with WS-Security Under Endpoint Herein is the source code for a barebones service that will be secured with WS-Security:  Nothing in the code hints at WSS security. The publisher code provides the first hint:  package ch05.wss;  import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod; import javax.xml.ws.WebServiceContext; import javax.annotation.Resource;  @WebService public class Echo {     @Resource     WebServiceContext ws_ctx;      @WebMethod     public String echo String msg  {         return "Echoing: " + msg;     } }  package ch05.wss;  import javax.xml.ws.Endpoint; import javax.xml.ws.Binding; import javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPBinding; import java.util.List; import java.util.LinkedList; import javax.xml.ws.handler.Handler;  public class EchoPublisher {     public static void main String[ ] args  {         Endpoint endpoint = Endpoint.create new Echo   ;         Binding binding = endpoint.getBinding  ;         List  hchain = new LinkedList   ;         hchain.add new EchoSecurityHandler   ;         binding.setHandlerChain hchain ;         endpoint.publish "http:  localhost:7777 echo" ;         System.out.println "http:  localhost:7777 echo" ;     } }  WS-Security  229  Download at Boykma.Com   Note that there is a programmatically added handler.

The first callback is the getHeaders, which the runtime invokes before invoking the handleMessage callback. The getHeaders method generates a security header block that complies with OASIS  Or- ganization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards  standards, in particular the standards for WSS  Web Services Security . The security processor vali- dates the security header. The second section of interest is, of course, the handleMessage callback that does most of the work. The incoming SOAP message  that is, the client’s request  is verified by authenticating  the  client  with  a  username password  check.  The  details  will  follow shortly. If the verification succeeds, the verified SOAP message becomes the new re- quest message. If the verification fails, a XWSSecurityException is thrown as a SOAP fault. The code segment is:  try {     ProcessingContext p_ctx =  xwss_processor.createProcessingContext msg ;     p_ctx.setSOAPMessage msg ;     SOAPMessage verified_msg = xwss_processor.verifyInboundMessage p_ctx ;     msg_ctx.setMessage verified_msg ;  WS-Security  231  Download at Boykma.Com       System.out.println SubjectAccessor.getRequesterSubject p_ctx  ;     if  trace_p  dump_msg "Incoming message:", verified_msg ; } catch  XWSSecurityException e  { throw new RuntimeException e ; }  On a successful verification, the print statement outputs:  Subject:    Principal: CN=fred    Public Credential: fred  where Fred is the authenticated subject with a principal, which is a specific identity under users roles security.  The CN stands for Common Name.  Fred’s name acts as the public credential, but his password remains secret.  Publishing a WS-Security Service with Endpoint  Web services that use WS-Security require packages that currently do not ship with core Java 6. It is easier to develop and configure such services with an IDE such as NetBeans and to deploy the services with an application server such as GlassFish, an approach taken in Chapter 6. It is possible to publish a WSS-based service with the Endpoint publisher, as this section illustrates. Here are the setup steps:    The JAR file xws-security-3.0.jar should be downloaded, as the packages therein are not currently part of core Java 6. A convenient site for downloading is http:   fisheye5.cenqua.com browse xwss repo com.sun.xml.wss.  For  convenience,  this JAR file can be placed in METRO_HOME lib.    For compilation and execution, two JAR files should be on the classpath: jaxws-  tools.jar and xws-security-3.0.jar.    The configuration files for a WSS-based service usually are housed in a META- INF subdirectory of the working directory; that is, the directory in which the serv- ice’s publisher and the client are invoked. In this case, the working directory is the parent directory of the ch05 subdirectory. There are two configuration files used in this example: server.xml and client.xml. The two files are identical to keep the example as simple as possible; in production, of course, they likely would differ.  Once the web service is deployed, wsimport can be used to generate the usual client- side artifacts. The Metro runtime kicks in automatically to generate the wsgen artifacts; hence, wsgen need not be run manually.  The example illustrates the clean separation of security concerns and application logic. All of the WS-Security code is confined to handlers on the client side and the service side.  The EchoSecurityHandler has a no-argument constructor that creates a security pro- cessor from information in the configuration file, in this case server.xml. Here is the constructor:  232  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com   public EchoSecurityHandler   {     XWSSProcessorFactory fact = null;     try {         fact = XWSSProcessorFactory.newInstance  ;     }     catch XWSSecurityException e  { throw new RuntimeException e ; }      FileInputStream config = null;     try {        config =  new FileInputStream new File "META-INF server.xml"  ;        xwss_processor =         fact.createProcessorForSecurityConfiguration config, new Verifier   ;        config.close  ;     }     catch  Exception e  { throw new RuntimeException e ; }     trace_p = true;    set to true to enable message dumps }  The Verifier object in the highlighted line does the actual validation. The configuration file is very simple:  <!-- Copyright 2004 Sun Microsystems, Inc. All rights reserved.      SUN PROPRIETARY CONFIDENTIAL. Use is subject to license terms. --> <xwss:SecurityConfiguration xmlns:xwss="http:  java.sun.com xml ns xwss config"                              dumpMessages="true" >          and usually is stored in a META-INF directory. In this example, the configuration file stipulates that messages to and from the web service should be dumped for inspection and that the password rather than a password digest is acceptable in the request mes- sage. The Verifier object handles the low-level details of authenticating the request by validating the incoming username and password. Here is the code:  package ch05.wss;  import javax.security.auth.callback.Callback; import javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler; import javax.security.auth.callback.UnsupportedCallbackException; import com.sun.xml.wss.impl.callback.PasswordCallback; import com.sun.xml.wss.impl.callback.PasswordValidationCallback; import com.sun.xml.wss.impl.callback.UsernameCallback;     Verifier handles service-side callbacks for password validation. public class Verifier implements CallbackHandler {        Username password hard-coded for simplicity and clarity.     private static final String _username = "fred";     private static final String _password = "rockbed";         For password validation, set the validator to the inner class below.     public void handle Callback[ ] callbacks  throws UnsupportedCallbackException {         for  int i = 0; i < callbacks.length; i++  {             if  callbacks[i] instanceof PasswordValidationCallback  {                PasswordValidationCallback cb= PasswordValidationCallback callbacks[i];                if  cb.getRequest   instanceof  WS-Security  233  Download at Boykma.Com                      PasswordValidationCallback.PlainTextPasswordRequest                     cb.setValidator new PlainTextPasswordVerifier   ;             }             else                throw new UnsupportedCallbackException null, "Not needed" ;         }     }         Encapsulated validate method verifies the username password.     private class PlainTextPasswordVerifier                       implements PasswordValidationCallback.PasswordValidator {         public boolean validate PasswordValidationCallback.Request req              throws PasswordValidationCallback.PasswordValidationException {              PasswordValidationCallback.PlainTextPasswordRequest plain_pwd =                  PasswordValidationCallback.PlainTextPasswordRequest  req;             if  _username.equals plain_pwd.getUsername    &&                 _password.equals plain_pwd.getPassword     {                 return true;             }             else                 return false;         }     } }  The authentication succeeds with a username of fred and a password of rockbed but fails otherwise. The security processor created in the EchoSecurityHandler constructor is responsible for invoking the handle callback in the Verifier. To keep the example simple, the username and password are hardcoded rather than retrieved from a data- base. Further, the password is plain text. A client-side SOAPHandler generates and inserts the WSS artifacts that the Echo service expects.

On the client side, the security processor uses a  Prompter object to get the username and password, which then are inserted into the outgoing SOAP message. Just as the service-side security processor generates a validated SOAP message if the au- thentication succeeds, so the client-side security processor generates a secured SOAP message if the Prompter works correctly. Here is the Prompter code:  package ch05.wss;  import java.io.IOException; import javax.security.auth.callback.Callback; import javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler; import javax.security.auth.callback.UnsupportedCallbackException; import com.sun.xml.wss.impl.callback.PasswordCallback; import com.sun.xml.wss.impl.callback.PasswordValidationCallback; import com.sun.xml.wss.impl.callback.UsernameCallback; import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.InputStreamReader;     Prompter handles client-side callbacks, in this case    to prompt for and read username password. public class Prompter implements CallbackHandler {        Read username or password from standard input.     private String readLine   {         String line = null;         try {             line = new BufferedReader new InputStreamReader System.in  .readLine  ;          }         catch IOException e  { }         return line;     }         Prompt for and read the username and the password.     public void handle Callback[ ] callbacks  throws UnsupportedCallbackException {         for  int i = 0; i < callbacks.length; i++  {             if  callbacks[i] instanceof UsernameCallback  {                 UsernameCallback cb =  UsernameCallback  callbacks[i];                 System.out.print "Username: " ;                 String username = readLine  ;  236  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com                   if  username != null  cb.setUsername username ;             }             else if  callbacks[i] instanceof PasswordCallback  {                 PasswordCallback cb =  PasswordCallback  callbacks[i];                 System.out.print "Password: " ;                 String password = readLine  ;                 if  password != null  cb.setPassword password ;             }         }     } }  The security processor interacts with the Prompter through a UsernameCallback and a PasswordCallback,  which  prompt  for,  read,  and  store  the  client’s  username  and password.  The Secured SOAP Envelope The client-side security processor generates a SOAP message with all of the WSS in- formation in the SOAP header. The SOAP body is indistinguishable from one in an unsecured SOAP message. Here is the SOAP message that the client sends:           <wsse:Security xmlns:wsse="http:  docs.oasis-open.org wss 2004 01                                oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd"                    S:mustUnderstand="1">    <wsse:UsernameToken xmlns:wsu="http:  docs.oasis-open.org wss 2004 01                                    oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd"                         wsu:Id="XWSSGID-1216851209528949783553">        fred        <wsse:Password           Type="http:  docs.oasis-open.org wss 2004 01                 oasis-200401-wss-username-token-profile-1.0PasswordText">            rockbed               <wsse:Nonce EncodingType="http:  docs.oasis-open.org wss 2004 01                              oasis-200401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0Base64Binary">            Vyg90XUn rl2F4m6lSFIZCoU                2008-07-23T22:13:33.001Z                            Hello, world!            In addition to the username and the password, the SOAP header includes a nonce, which is a randomly generated, statistically unique cryptographic token inserted into  WS-Security  237  Download at Boykma.Com   the message. A nonce is added to safeguard against message theft and replay attacks in which an unsecured credential such as a password is retransmitted to perform an un- authorized operation. For example, if Eve were to intercept Alice’s password from a SOAP message that transfers funds from one of Alice’s bank accounts to another of Alice’s accounts, then Eve might replay the scenario at a later time using the pirated password to transfer Alice’s funds into Eve’s account. If the message receiver requires not only the usual credentials such as a password but also a nonce with certain secret attributes, then Eve would need more than just the pirated password—Eve also would need to replicate the nonce, which should be computationally intractable. The SOAP message from the Echo service to the client has no WSS artifacts at all:                             Echoing: Hello, world!                 Summary of the WS-Security Example This first example of WS-Security introduces the API but has the obvious drawback of sending the client’s username and password, together with the nonce, over an unsecure channel. The reason, of course, is that the Endpoint publisher does not support HTTPS connections. A quick fix would be to use the HttpsServer illustrated earlier. Yet the example does meet the goal of illustrating how WS-Security itself, without any support from a transport protocol such as HTTP or a container such as Tomcat, sup- ports authentication and authorization. The example likewise shows that WS-Security encourages a clean separation of security concerns from web service logic. Chapter 6 drills deeper into the details of WS-Security and provides a production-grade example.  What’s Next? So  far  all  of  the  sample  web  services  have  been  deployed  using  either  Endpoint, HttpsServer, or Tomcat. This low-fuss approach has the benefit of keeping the focus on Java’s web service API. In a production environment, a lightweight web container such as Tomcat or a heavyweight application server such as BEA WebLogic, GlassFish, JBoss, or WebSphere would be the likely choice for deploying SOAP-based and REST- style services. The next chapter looks at GlassFish, which includes Metro and is the reference implementation of a Java web services container.  238  Chapter 5: Web Services Security  Download at Boykma.Com   CHAPTER 6 JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Overview of a Java Application Server In previous chapters, SOAP-based and REST-style web services have been deployed using mostly the Endpoint publisher or the Tomcat web container. This chapter illus- trates how web services can be deployed using a Java Application Server  JAS , the software centerpiece of enterprise Java. The current version of enterprise Java is Java EE 5, which includes EJB 3.0. To begin, here is a sketch of the software bundled into a JAS:  Web container  A web container deploys servlets and web services. A traditional web application in  Java  is  a  mix  of  static  HTML  pages,  servlets,  higher-level  servlet  generators such as JSP  Java Server Pages  and JSF  Java Server Faces  scripts, backend Java- Beans for JSP and JSF scripts, and utility classes. Tomcat is the reference imple- mentation  RI  for a web container. Tomcat, like other web containers, can be embedded  in  an  application  server.  Web  components  are  deployed  in  the  web container as WAR files, which typically contain the standard configuration docu- ment web.xml and may contain vendor-specific configuration documents as well  e.g.,  sun-jaxws.xml .  To  host  web  services,  a  web  container  relies  on  a  servlet interceptor  in the case of Tomcat, a WSServlet instance  that mediates between the client and the web service SIB.  Message-oriented middleware  The message-oriented middleware supports JMS  Java Message Service , which provides the store-and-forward technologies lumped together under the term mes- saging. JMS supports synchronous and asynchronous messaging styles and two types of message repository: topics, which are akin to bulletin boards in that a read  operation  does  not  automatically  remove  a  posted  message,  and  queues, which are FIFO  First In, First Out  lists in which a read operation, by default, removes the read item from the queue. In JMS, a publisher publishes messages to a topic and a sender sends messages to a queue. A subscriber to a topic or a re- ceiver on a queue receives such messages either synchronously through a blocking  239  Download at Boykma.Com   read operation or asynchronously through the JMS notification mechanism. JMS topics  implement  the  publisher subscriber  model  of  messaging,  whereas  JMS queues implement the point-to-point model.  Enterprise Java Bean  EJB  container  The EJB container holds EJB instances, which are of three types: Session, Entity, and Message-Driven. Session and traditional Entity EJBs are built on a Java RMI  Remote Method Invocation  foundation, whereas Message-Driven EJBs are built on a JMS foundation. The Message-Driven EJB is a JMS MessageListener implemented as an EJB. A lis- tener receives an event notification whenever a new message arrives at a topic or a queue to which the listener has subscribed. A Session EJB typically implements an enterprise application’s business logic and interacts as needed with other application components, either local  for instance, other EJBs in the same container  or remote  for instance, clients on a different host . As the name suggests, a Session EJB is designed to maintain a client session. A Session EJB is either stateless or stateful. A stateless Session EJB is, in effect, a collection of mutually independent instance methods that should operate only on data passed in as arguments. The EJB container assumes that a stateless Session EJB instance does not maintain state information in instance fields. Suppose, for example, that a Session EJB encapsulates two instance methods, m1 and m2. If this EJB were deployed as stateless, then the EJB container would assume that a par- ticular client, C, could invoke m1 in one EJB instance and m2 in another EJB instance because the two methods do not share state. If the same Session EJB were deployed as stateful, then the EJB container would have to ensure that C’s invocation of m1 and m2 involved the same EJB instance because the two methods presumably share state. As this summary implies, an EJB container automatically manages a pool of EJB instances for all types of EJB. A SOAP-based web service can be implemented as a stateless Session EJB by annotating the SIB with @Stateless. Prior to Java EE 5, an Entity EJB instance was the preferred way to provide an enterprise application with an in-memory cache of database objects such as a table row. The Entity EJB was the persistence construct that brought ORM  Object Re- lational Mapping  capabilities to the application. A traditional Entity EJB could be deployed with either BMP  Bean Managed Persistence  or CMP  Container Man- aged  Persistence .  At  issue  was  whether  the  programmer  or  the  EJB  container maintained coherence between the data source  for instance, a table row  and the EJB instance. In the early days of EJB containers, the case could be made that BMP was more efficient. Yet the EJB containers quickly improved to the point that CMP became the obvious choice. Indeed, CMP emerged as a major inducement for and benefit of using traditional Entity EJBs. An EJB deployed with CMP also had to deploy with CMT  Container Managed Transactions . Prior to EJB 3.0, EJBs in general and Entity EJBs in particular were very difficult to code and to configure. The coding was tricky and the configuration required a  240  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com   large, complicated XML document known affectionately as the DD  Deployment Descriptor . All of this changed with Java EE 5, which extended the capabilities of the  original  Entity  EJB  to  POJO  classes  annotated  with  @Entity.  In  effect,  the @Entity annotation let Java programmers enjoy the benefits of the traditional Entity EJB without enduring the pain of configuring and programming this kind of EJB. The @Entity annotation is at the center of the Java Persistence API  JPA , which integrates features from related technologies such as Hibernate, Oracle’s TopLink, Java Data Objects, and traditional Entity EJBs. The @Entity is now the preferred way to handle persistence. An @Entity, unlike an Entity EJB, can be used in either core Java or enterprise Java applications. EJBs, unlike servlets, are thread-safe because the EJB container assumes responsi- bility for thread synchronization.  As in the case of servlets, each client request against an EJB executes as a separate thread.  Even in a traditional browser-based web application, EJBs are thus well suited as backend support for servlets. For instance, a servlet might pass a request along to a Session EJB, which in turn might use instances of various @Entity classes as persisted data sources  see Figure 6-1 .  Figure 6-1. Architecture of an enterprise application  JNDI service provider  A JNDI  Java Naming and Directory Interface  provider maintains, at the least, a naming service in which names  for instance, the deployed name of an EJB or a message queue  are bound to entities  in this case, the deployed EJB or the queue . If the JNDI provider supports directory services as well, then the name of an entity binds to the entity and its attributes. In the simple case, a JNDI provider maintains a hierarchical database of name entity pairs. Any component dropped into a JAS container is automatically registered with the naming service and thereafter avail- able for lookup by potential clients. In Java EE 5, the JNDI provider is largely unseen infrastructure.  Security provider  The  security  provider  provides  high-level  security  services  for  components  de- ployed in any of the containers. Among these services are, of course, authentication  Overview of a Java Application Server   241  Client  HTTP request  HTTP response  HTML doc   Web container  Servlet JSP JSF  EJB container  Session EJB  @Entity  RDBMS  Download at Boykma.Com   and authorization. The security provider has to be JAAS  Java Authentication and Authorization Service  compliant. Nowadays a security provider typically has plu- gins for providers such as an LDAP  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  pro- vider. The security in an application server is usually integrated. For instance, the container-managed security that the web container provides is integrated into the default JAAS-based security that the EJB container provides.  Relational Database Management System  An application server usually includes an RDMS  Relational Database Manage- ment System , which is the default persistence store for @Entity instances and may be accessed programatically and directly from other components such as web serv- ices and servlets. A modern application server makes it easy to plug in the database system of choice if the provided system is not the preferred one. The GlassFish application server introduced in this chapter ships with Java DB, Sun’s supported distribution  of  the  Apache  Derby  relational  database  management  system  RDBMS   http:  db.apache.org derby .  Client container  The client container consists of the software libraries that a client requires to in- teract with deployed components such as message topics or EJBs and to use services such as JNDI and security.  On the web tier, a JAS supports both traditional interactive websites and web services. The model-view-controller  MVC  architecture is popular in modern interactive web- sites. A model maintains state information about the site and is responsible for persis- tence; a view provides an appropriate representation of a model; and a controller is a request endpoint that implements the business logic that coordinates a model and a view. In enterprise and even in core Java, an @Entity instance is a natural way to im- plement a model with persistence. In interactive web applications, JSP or JSF scripts can generate an HTML view of a model, and either a servlet or a Session EJB is a natural way to implement a controller. For Java-based web services deployed in an application server such as GlassFish, @Entity instances are likewise a natural way to implement models. The web service is the controller that exposes business logic in @WebMethod code and interacts, as appropriate, with models. The web service can be deployed in a WAR file, which amounts to a servlet-based deployment, or in an EAR  Enterprise ARchive  file, which is an EJB-based deployment. The distinction between servlet-based and EJB- based deployment will be discussed again later. As a bundle of so many features and services, an application server is inherently com- plicated software. At issue among Java programmers is whether the benefits that come with an application server offset the complexity of using it. This complexity stems, in large part, from the fact that so many APIs come into play in an application server. An application  that  incorporates  servlets,  JSP  scripts,  JSF  scripts,  messaging,  and  EJBs must deal with at least five distinct APIs. Integrating web components such as servlets with EJBs remains nontrivial. This state of affairs accounts for recent efforts among vendors to provide seamless integration of Java EE components, which presumably  242  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com   would result in a lighter-weight, more programmer-friendly framework for doing en- terprise Java. JBoss Seam is one such effort. It should be noted, however, that Java EE 5 is significantly easier to use than its predecessor, J2EE 1.4. Java EE is definitely moving down the road that lighter frameworks such as Spring cut out for enterprise Java. The GlassFish application server is open source and the reference implementation.  To be legalistic, a particular snapshot of GlassFish is the RI.  The current production release can be downloaded from https:  glassfish.dev.java.net. This release is also bundled into the NetBeans IDE download, available at http:  www.netbeans.org. The examples in this chapter are deployed under GlassFish, and some are developed or refined using NetBeans.  No  example  requires  the  use  of  a  particular  IDE,  including  NetBeans, however.  GlassFish Basics  Assume that AS_HOME points to the GlassFish install directory. In the bin subdirectory is a script named asadmin that can be used to start GlassFish:  % asadmin start-domain domain1  For Windows, the script is asadmin.bat. When the application server starts, it prints the ports on which it listens for requests. For example, port 8080 or port 8081 may be given as the HTTP port. To confirm that GlassFish has started, open a browser to http:  localhost:8080, assuming that 8080 is among the listed HTTP ports. The welcome page should appear with links to GlassFish documentation and the like. The command:  % asadmin stop-domain domain1  stops deployment from domain1, whereas the command:  % asadmin stop-appserv  stops the application server as a whole.  The URL http:  localhost:4848 is for the administrative console, which has various util- ities for inspecting and managing deployed components, including web services. The default username for the administrative console is admin, and the default password is adminadmin. The administrative console is helpful in testing newly deployed web serv- ices. For any @WebMethod that can be invoked through HTTP, GlassFish generates an interactive web page from which the method can be tested with sample arguments. Request and response SOAP messages are displayed. The WSDL and other XML docu- ments are likewise available for inspection. Deploying a web service is easy. Suppose that a @WebService with an SIB class named Hi has been packaged in a WAR file named hello.war.  The packaging details are the same as for Tomcat but will be reviewed in the first example later.  To deploy the application,  the  WAR  file  is  copied  to  AS_HOME domains domain1 autodeploy.  If the deployment succeeds, a second file named hello.war_deployed appears in a second or  so  in  the  autodeploy  directory.  If  the  deployment  fails,  then  the  empty  file hello.war_deployedFailed  appears  instead.  On  a  failed  deployment,  the  domains  domain1 logs server.log file contains the details. If the deployment succeeds, the WSDL  Overview of a Java Application Server   243  Download at Boykma.Com   can be inspected by opening a browser to http:  localhost:8080 hello HiService?wsdl. The default name of the service, HiService, follows the JWS convention of appending Service to the SIB name Hi. The Java DB database system can be started with the command:  This command starts the Derby RDBMS, which then runs independently of the appli- cation server. The database is stopped with the command:  % asadmin start-database  % asadmin stop-database  Deploying @WebServices and @WebServiceProviders The  SOAP-based  Teams  web  service  from  Chapter  1  has  four  classes:  Player,  Team, TeamsUtility, and the SIB Teams. For this example, the four files reside in the directory ch06 team and all are in the Java package ch06.team. For review, here is the original SIB but in the new package:  package ch06.team;  import java.util.List; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod;  @WebService public class Teams {     private TeamsUtility utils;     public Teams   { utils = new TeamsUtility  ; }      @WebMethod     public Team getTeam String name  { return utils.getTeam name ; }     @WebMethod     public List  getTeams   { return utils.getTeams  ; } }  After  compilation,  the  .class  files  are  copied  to  the  directory  ch06 team WEB-INF  classes ch06 team because Tomcat, the web container for GlassFish, expects compiled classes to reside in the WEB-INF classes tree. A WAR file is created with the command:  % jar cvf team.war WEB-INF  and the WAR file then is copied to AS_HOME domains domain1 autodeploy. Although the  Teams  service  is  document-style,  there  is  no  need  to  generate  manually,  using wsgen, the JAX-B artifacts that such a service requires. GlassFish ships with the current Metro release, which automatically generates these artifacts. The client-side wsimport artifacts are generated in the usual way:  % wsimport -keep -p clientC http:  localhost:8081 team TeamsService?wsdl  244  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com   Here is a sample client that uses the wsimport-generated artifacts:  import teamsC.TeamsService; import teamsC.Teams; import teamsC.Team; import teamsC.Player; import java.util.List;  class TeamsClient {     public static void main String[ ] args  {         TeamsService service = new TeamsService  ;         Teams port = service.getTeamsPort  ;          List  teams = port.getTeams  ;         for  Team team : teams  {             System.out.println "Team name: " + team.getName   +                                "  roster count: " + team.getRosterCount   + " " ;             for  Player player : team.getPlayers                    System.out.println "  Player: " + player.getNickname   ;         }     } }  The output is:  Team name: Abbott and Costello  roster count: 2    Player: Bud   Player: Lou Team name: Marx Brothers  roster count: 3    Player: Chico   Player: Groucho   Player: Harpo Team name: Burns and Allen  roster count: 2    Player: George   Player: Gracie  In addition to the WSDL, GlassFish automatically generates the deployment artifacts, including  a  webservices.xml  document  and  a  sun-web.xml  document.  These  can  be inspected in the administrative console.  Deploying @WebServiceProviders Deploying a @WebServiceProvider is slightly more complicated in that the WAR file requires a web.xml and sun-jaxws.xml. Here is source code for a RESTful service that does temperature conversions and computes Fibonacci numbers:  package ch06.rest;  import javax.xml.ws.Provider; import javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory; import javax.xml.transform.Transformer; import javax.xml.transform.Source; import javax.xml.transform.Result; import javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMResult; import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource;  Deploying @WebServices and @WebServiceProviders   245  Download at Boykma.Com   import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult; import javax.annotation.Resource; import javax.xml.ws.BindingType; import javax.xml.ws.WebServiceContext; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import javax.xml.ws.http.HTTPException; import javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider; import javax.xml.ws.ServiceMode; import javax.xml.ws.http.HTTPBinding; import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream; import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream; import java.io.StringWriter; import org.w3c.dom.Document; import org.w3c.dom.NodeList; import org.w3c.dom.Node; import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory; import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder;  @WebServiceProvider @ServiceMode value = javax.xml.ws.Service.Mode.MESSAGE  @BindingType value = HTTPBinding.HTTP_BINDING  public class RestfulProviderD implements Provider  {     @Resource     protected WebServiceContext ws_context;     protected Document document;    DOM tree     public Source invoke Source request  {         try {            if  ws_context == null  throw new RuntimeException "No ws_context." ;            MessageContext msg_context = ws_context.getMessageContext  ;               Check the HTTP request verb.

The @WebServiceProvider must be deployed with the two configuration docu- ments. Following is the web.xml:    <web-app version="2.4" xmlns="http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee"          xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"          xsi:schemaLocation="http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee          http:  java.sun.com xml ns j2ee web-app_2_4.xsd">    RestfulProvider Service                   com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServletContextListener                    RestfulProviderD       RestfulProviderD       com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServlet               RestfulProviderD        restful *         And here is the sun-jaxws.xml:          <endpoint name="RestfulProviderD"         implementation="ch06.rest.RestfulProviderD"         binding="http:  www.w3.org 2004 08 wsdl http"         url-pattern=' restful *' >    These are essentially the same XML configuration files, with respect to structure, that were used to deploy SOAP-based and REST-style services under Tomcat. GlassFish automatically recognizes a @WebService even without the configuration files but does not similarly recognize a @WebServiceProvider; hence, the configuration documents are needed in the second case. Here is a sample client against the service. For variety, the client does a DOM parse but without using XPath:  import javax.xml.ws.Service; import javax.xml.namespace.QName; import javax.xml.ws.http.HTTPBinding; import javax.xml.ws.ServiceMode; import javax.xml.ws.Dispatch; import javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory; import javax.xml.transform.Transformer;  248  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com   import javax.xml.transform.Source; import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource; import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import java.net.URL; import java.util.Map; import java.io.StringReader; import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream; import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream; import org.w3c.dom.Document; import org.w3c.dom.NodeList; import org.w3c.dom.Node; import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory; import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder;  class DispatchClient {     private static String xml =         " " + "\n" +         " " + "\n" +         "   f2c " + "\n" +         "   -40 " + "\n" +         " " + "\n";      public static void main String[ ] args  throws Exception {         QName qname = new QName "", "" ;         String url_string = "http:  127.0.0.1:8080 restfulD restful ";         URL url = new URL url_string ;             Create the service and add a port         Service service = Service.create qname ;         service.addPort qname, HTTPBinding.HTTP_BINDING, url_string ;          Dispatch  dispatcher = service.createDispatch qname,                                                 Source.class,                                                 javax.xml.ws.Service.Mode.MESSAGE ;         Map  rc = dispatcher.getRequestContext  ;         rc.put MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD, "POST" ;         Source result = dispatcher.invoke new StreamSource new StringReader xml   ;         parse_response result ;     }      private static void parse_response Source res  throws Exception {         Transformer transformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance  .newTransformer  ;         ByteArrayOutputStream bao = new ByteArrayOutputStream  ;         StreamResult sr = new StreamResult bao ;         transformer.transform res, sr ;         ByteArrayInputStream bai = new ByteArrayInputStream bao.toByteArray   ;         DocumentBuilder db = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance  .newDocumentBuilder  ;         Document root = db.parse bai ;         NodeList nodes = root.getElementsByTagName "return" ;         Node node = nodes.item 0 ;    should be only one   element         System.out.println "Request document:\n" + xml ;         System.out.println "Return value: " + node.getFirstChild  .getNodeValue   ;     } }  Deploying @WebServices and @WebServiceProviders   249  Download at Boykma.Com   The output is:  Request document:        f2c     -40     Return value: -40.0  The deployment of a @WebService and that of a @WebServiceProvider differ slightly under GlassFish, although the two deployments are the same under either Endpoint or stand- alone Tomcat. The next section illustrates how a deployed web service can be invoked from a JSP or JSF script.  Integrating an Interactive Website and a Web Service A Web service client is usually not interactive and, in particular, not a browser. This section illustrates, as proof of concept, how a browser-based client might be used with a SOAP-based web service. The @WebService is simple and familiar:  package ch06.tc; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod;  @WebService public class TempConvert {     @WebMethod     public float c2f float t  { return 32.0F +  t * 9.0F   5.0F ; }     @WebMethod     public float f2c float t  { return  5.0F   9.0F  *  t - 32.0F ; } }  After the compiled TempConvert is copied to the ch06 tc WEB-INF classes ch06 tc di- rectory, the WAR file is created and copied as usual to the domains domain1 autode ploy directory under AS_HOME. The next step is to write the interactive web application, which in this case consists of an HTML document, two small JSP scripts, and a vanilla web.xml document. Here is the HTML form for a user to enter a temperature to be converted:                Temperature to convert:                         And here is the JSP script that invokes the TempConvert web service to do the temperature conversion:  250  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com              <%    String temp_str = request.getParameter "temperature" ;    if  temp_str != null  temp = Float.parseFloat temp_str.trim   ;     TempConvertService service =  new TempConvertService  ;    TempConvert port = service.getTempConvertPort  ;    f2c = port.f2C temp ;    c2f = port.c2F temp ; %>   F =  C    C =  F   Try another      The  two  imported  classes,  client.TempConvert  and  client.TempConvertService,  are wsimport-generated artifacts in the WEB-INF classes client subdirectory of the direc- tory that holds the HTML document and the two JSP scripts. For completeness, here is the error.jsp script:               Bad data: please try again.    Return to home page           The web.xml deployment document is also short:   <web-app xmlns = 'http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee'          xmlns:xsi = 'http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance'          xsi:schemaLocation = 'http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee web-app_2_5.xsd'          version = '2.5'>     JSP frontend to TempConvert service              java.lang.NumberFormatException          error.jsp                   index.html            Integrating an Interactive Website and a Web Service  251  Download at Boykma.Com   The HTML page and the JSP scripts together with the compiled classes and web.xml are then put into a WAR file:  % jar cvf tcJSP.war index.html *.jsp WEB-INF  for deployment in the GlassFish autodeploy subdirectory. For testing, a browser can be opened to the URL http:  localhost:8081 tcJSP.  A @WebService As an EJB The EJB container is programmer-friendly in handling issues such as thread safety, instance pooling, and transaction-guarded persistence. This section illustrates how a @WebService can take advantage of these benefits by being implemented as a stateless Session EJB. The example is in two steps. The first step quickly covers the details of deploying  a  @WebService  as  a  stateless  Session  EJB.  The  second  step  adds  database persistence by introducing an @Entity into the application. The example is kept simple so that the EJB and @Entity details stand out.  Implementation As a Stateless Session EJB Here is the SEI for the FibEJB service to be implemented as a stateless Session EJB:  The main change is that the annotation @Stateless occurs. The same annotation occurs in the SIB:  package ch06.ejb;  import java.util.List; import javax.ejb.Stateless; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod;  @Stateless @WebService public interface Fib {     @WebMethod int fib int n ;     @WebMethod List getFibs  ; }  package ch06.ejb;  import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList; import javax.ejb.Stateless; import javax.jws.WebService;  @Stateless @WebService endpointInterface = "ch06.ejb.Fib"  public class FibEJB implements Fib {     public int fib int n  {         int fib = 1, prev = 0;  252  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com           for  int i = 2; i <= n; i++  {             int temp = fib;             fib += prev;             prev = temp;         }         return fib;     }     public List getFibs   { return new ArrayList  ; }    for now, empty list }  In the spirit of a stateless Session EJB, the implementing class consists of self-contained methods that do not rely on any instance fields. This first version of the getFibs oper- ation returns the empty list, but the next version returns the rows in a database table. The packaging of the EJB implementation of the service differs from the standard WAR packaging. To begin, all of the required classes are placed in a JAR file whose name is arbitrary. In this case, the command: % jar cvf rc.jar ch06 ejb *.class  creates the file. There is no configuration document; hence, GlassFish will generate one automatically. This JAR file is then enclosed in another:  % jar cvf fib.ear rc.jar  The EAR  Enterprise ARchive  extension is traditional for EJBs. GlassFish expects that a deployed EAR file contains at least one EJB or @Entity POJO, although a production- level EAR file typically contains several EJBs. In any case, an EAR file holds one JAR file per EJB and may hold WAR files as well. The entire EAR file constitutes a single enterprise application, with the particular JAR files therein housing the various appli- cation components. In this example, there is one component: the stateless Session EJB in its own JAR file. Once the EAR file is deployed in the usual way by being copied to domains domain1  autodeploy directory, the administrative console can be used to inspect the application, which is listed appropriately under the WebServices section in the console. GlassFish automatically generates various deployment artifacts, including the WSDL:    <!-- Published by JAX-WS RI at http:  jax-ws.dev.java.net.

GlassFish includes the current Metro release, which supports WS-Policy and related WS-* initiatives that promote web services interoperability: WSIT in Metro speak. The policy templates are laid out at the top of the WSDL and then referenced throughout the rest of the document. However, all of the policy templates are marked as merely optional. The underlying idea is that a web service and its potential consumers should be able to articulate policies about security and other service-related matters. For example, there is a set of policies on reliable messaging that belongs to the WS- ReliableMessaging specification. Under this specification, a WSDL could advertise that any message is to be sent exactly once and, therefore, must never be duplicated. If an  A @WebService As an EJB  255  Download at Boykma.Com   intermediary along the path from the sender to the receiver encounters a problem in delivering a message, the appropriate fault must be raised and the message must not be resent. Another WS-ReliableMessaging policy stipulates that messages will be re- ceived in the same order in which they are sent, a feature that the TCP infrastructure of HTTP HTTPS already guarantees. Yet because SOAP-based web services are de- signed to be transport neutral, there is a specification on reliable messaging, several on security, and so on.  The Endpoint URL for an EBJ-Based Service The endpoint URL for the EJB-based web service differs from WAR examples seen so far. For one thing, the name of the EAR file does not occur in the path as does the name of a WAR file. There are two pieces in the path section of the URL: the first is the SIB name with Service appended, giving FibEJBService in this example; the second is the SIB name, in this case FibEJB. The combination is shown in the URL below for the sample Perl client:  ! usr bin perl -w use SOAP::Lite; use strict; my $url = 'http:  localhost:8081 FibEJBService FibEJB?wsdl'; my $service = SOAP::Lite->service $url ; print $service->fib 7 , "\n";  For convenience and simplicity, this example uses only defaults. For example, the EJB is deployed with the name FibEJBService and the path  FibEJBService FibEJB. These defaults can be overridden by adding attributes in an annotation or by entries in a deployment descriptor. The good news is that there are defaults. The next step is to add a database table as the persistence store and an  @Entity to automate the interaction between the web service and the database. This step requires only modest additions to the service.  Database Support Through an @Entity The SEI interface Fib stays the same, but the SIB FibEJB changes to the following:  package ch06.ejb; import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList; import javax.ejb.Stateless; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.persistence.PersistenceContext; import javax.persistence.EntityManager; import javax.persistence.Query; @Stateless @WebService endpointInterface = "ch06.ejb.Fib"  public class FibEJB implements Fib {     @PersistenceContext unitName = "FibServicePU"      private EntityManager em;  256  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com       public int fib int n  {            Computed already? If so, return.         FibNum fn = em.find FibNum.class, n ;    read from database         if  fn != null  return fn.getF  ;          int f = compute_fib Math.abs n  ;         fn = new FibNum  ;         fn.setN n ;         fn.setF f ;         em.persist fn ;                          write to database         return f;     }      public List getFibs   {         Query query = em.createNativeQuery "select * from FibNum" ;            fib_nums is a list of pairs: N and Fibonacci N          List fib_nums = query.getResultList  ;    read from database         List results = new ArrayList  ;         for  Object next : fib_nums  {             List list =  List  next;             for  Object n : list  results.add n ;         }         return results;    N, fib N , K, fib K ,...     }      private int compute_fib int n  {         int fib = 1, prev = 0;         for  int i = 2; i <= n; i++  {             int temp = fib;             fib += prev;             prev = temp;         }         return fib;     } }  On a client request for a particular Fibonacci number, the service now does a find operation against the database. If the value is not stored in the database, then the value is  computed  and  stored  there.  If  the  client  requests  a  list  of  all  Fibonacci  numbers computed so far, the service executes a query against the database to get the list, which is returned. This overview now can be fleshed out with details. The FibEJB SIB uses dependency injection to get a reference to an EntityManager that, as the name indicates, manages any @Entity within a given PersistenceContext. The @Entity in this case is a FibNum:  package ch06.ejb;  import javax.persistence.Entity; import javax.persistence.Id; import javax.persistence.Column; import java.io.Serializable;  A @WebService As an EJB  257  Download at Boykma.Com      A FibNum is a pair: an integer N and its Fibonacci value. @Entity public class FibNum implements Serializable {     private int n;     private int f;      public FibNum   { }      @Id     public int getN   { return n; }     public void setN int n  { this.n = n; }      public int getF   { return f; }     public void setF int f  { this.f = f; } }  A FibNum has two properties, one for an integer N and another for the Fibonacci value of N. In the corresponding database table, the integer N serves as the primary key; that is, as the @Id. How the database is created will be explained shortly. First, though, a bit more on the EntityManager is in order. By  default  in  the  EJB  container,  a  PersistenceContext  includes  transaction  support through a JTA  Java Transaction API  manager; hence, transactions are automatic be- cause the container introduces and manages them. Again by default in this example, the scope of the transaction is a single read or write operation against the database. The method fib invokes the EntityManager method find to retrieve a FibNum from the da- tabase, with each FibNum as one row in the table. If a particular FibNum is not in the table, then a new @Entity instance is created and persisted with a call to the EntityManager method persist. The methods encapsulated in an EntityManager such as find and persist are not in- herently thread-safe. These methods become thread-safe in this example because the EntityManager instance is a field in an EJB and, therefore, enjoys the thread safety that the EJB container bestows.  The Persistence Configuration File Nothing in the Web service code or the support code explicitly references the database or  the  table  therein.  These  details  are  handled  through  a  configuration  document, META-INF persistence.xml:                                This unit manages Fibonacci number persistence.                    jdbc __default                                                 258  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com             <property name="toplink.platform.class.name"                value="oracle.toplink.essentials.platform.database.DerbyPlatform" >                    ch06.ejb.FibNum           Each JAR file with an @Entity should have a META-INF directory with a file named persistence.xml. The lines in bold need explanation. GlassFish comes with several JDBC resources, including the one with the JNDI name jdbc __default used here. The administrative console has a utility for creating new databases. As noted earlier, GlassFish also ships with the Apache Derby database sys- tem, which in turn includes the TopLink utility called java2db that generates a table schema from a Java class, in this case the class FibNum. Recall that FibNum is annotated as an @Entity and has two properties, one for an integer N  the primary key  and another for the Fibonacci value of N. Under the hood the java2db utility generates the corre- sponding database table with two columns, one for N and another for its Fibonacci value. If desired, the names of the database table and the columns can be specified with the @Table and @Column annotations, respectively. In the FibEJB service, the @WebMethod named fib invokes the find method whose ar- gument is the primary key for the desired FibNum pair. By contrast, the method with the name getFibs relies on a query to retrieve all of the rows in the database. These rows are returned as a list of pair lists, in effect as   1,1 ,  2,1 ,  3,2 ,... . The getFibs method uses a native as opposed to a JPQL  Java Persistence Query Language  query to retrieve the rows and then creates a simple list of integers to return to the requester. The returned list looks like  1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2,... , with N and its Fibonacci value as adjacent values. Here is a sample client against the FibEJB service:  import clientEJB.FibEJBService; import clientEJB.Fib; import java.util.List;  class ClientEJB {    public static void main String args[ ]  {       FibEJBService service = new FibEJBService  ;       Fib port = service.getFibEJBPort  ;        final int n=8;       for  int i=1; i<n; i++  System.out.println "Fib " + i + "  == "+port.fib i  ;        List fibs = port.getFibs  ;       for  Object next : fibs  System.out.println next ;    } }  The output is: Fib 1  == 1 Fib 2  == 1 Fib 3  == 2  A @WebService As an EJB  259  Download at Boykma.Com   Fib 4  == 3 Fib 5  == 5 Fib 6  == 8 Fib 7  == 13 1 1 2 1 3 2 4 3 5 5 6 8 7 13  The EJB Deployment Descriptor The FibEJB service is implemented as an EJB and packaged in an EAR file without a deployment descriptor  DD , which is an XML document in the file ejb-jar.xml. In an EAR file, each EJB occurs in its own JAR file that optionally has a DD for the EJB. Here is the DD that GlassFish generates for FibEJB:    <ejb-jar xmlns="http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee"           xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"           metadata-complete="true" version="3.0"           xsi:schemaLocation="http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee                               http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee ejb-jar_3_0.xsd">                  Fib         Fib         ch06.ejb.Fib         Stateless         Container                                               FibEJB         FibEJB         ch06.ejb.Fib         ch06.ejb.Fib         ch06.ejb.FibEJB         Stateless         Container                   ch06.ejb.FibEJB em            260  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com            FibServicePU           Transaction                       ch06.ejb.FibEJB             em                                                           There are two   sections, one at the top for the SEI Fib and another at the bottom for the SIB FibEJB. Each section indicates that the Session EJB is deployed as stateless  with  container-managed  transactions.  The  SIB  section  provides  additional details about persistence, including the reference em that refers to the EntityManager used in FibEJB. The key point is that the persistence context is transaction-based, with the EJB container responsible for transaction management.  Servlet and EJB Implementations of Web Services GlassFish allows web services to be deployed in either WAR or EAR files. In the first case, GlassFish characterizes the implementation as servlet-based because, as seen in the examples with standalone Tomcat, a WSServlet instance intercepts that web service requests and passes these on to the web service packaged in the WAR file. In the second case, the web service is a stateless Session EJB that the EJB container manages. In the servlet implementation, the web container handles requests against the web service; in the EJB implementation, the EJB container handles requests against the web service. A given web service thus can be implemented in two different ways. At issue, then, are the tradeoffs between the two implementations of a web service. The main advantage of the EJB implementation is that the EJB container provides more services than does the servlet container. For one thing, a web service implemented as an EJB is thereby thread-safe, whereas the operationally identical service implemented as a POJO is not thread-safe. In the FibEJB example, the web operation fib does a read and a possible write against the database, and the operation getFibs does a read. The EJB container also automatically wraps these database operations in transactions, which remain transparent. The EJB container manages the persistence so that the ap- plication  does  not  have  to  do  so.  In  a  servlet-based  or  Endpoint-based  service,  the application would take on these responsibilities. Prior to EJB 3.0, a strong case could be made that EJBs in general, including even Session EJBs, were simply too much work for too little reward. The case is no longer so strong. As the FibEJB example shows, the EJB implementation of a SOAP-based service requires only one additional annotation, @Stateless, and the packaging of an EJB-based service  A @WebService As an EJB  261  Download at Boykma.Com   in an EAR file is arguably no harder than packaging the same service in a WAR file with its WEB-INF classes structure.  Java Web Services and Java Message Service GlassFish, like any full-feature application server, includes a JMS provider that supports publish subscribe  topic-based  and point-to-point  queue-based  messaging. Topics and queues are persistent stores. For example, one application can send a message to a JMS queue, and another application, at some later time, can retrieve the message from the queue. However, the JMS does not specify how long an implementation needs to persist messages. This section illustrates the basics of JWS JMS interaction with two web services. The MsgSender service has a send operation that inserts a message in a queue, and the MsgReceiver service has a receive operation that retrieves a message from the front of the queue  see Figure 6-2 .  Figure 6-2. Integrating JAX-WS and JMS  Here is the source code for the MsgSender service:  package ch06.jms;  import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod; import javax.jms.Queue; import javax.jms.Session; import javax.jms.TextMessage; import javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory; import javax.jms.QueueConnection; import javax.jms.Session; import javax.jms.JMSException; import javax.annotation.Resource;     A web service that sends a message to a queue. @WebService public class MsgSender {        name and mappedName can differ; mappedName is the JNDI lookup name     @Resource name="qcf", mappedName="qcf"      private QueueConnectionFactory qf;  262  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  MsgSender service  MsgReceiver service  Send  Receive  JMS message queue  Back  Front  Download at Boykma.Com       @Resource name="jmsQ", mappedName="jmsQ"      private Queue queue;      private QueueConnection conn;      @WebMethod     public void send String msg  {         try {             if  conn == null  conn =  QueueConnection  qf.createConnection  ;             Session session =                 conn.createSession false,    no transaction support                                    Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;                 Wrap the string in a TextMessage for sending.             TextMessage tmsg = session.createTextMessage msg ;             session.createProducer queue .send tmsg ;             session.close  ;         }         catch JMSException e  { throw new RuntimeException e ; }     } }  Setting Up GlassFish Queues and Topics  The asadmin utility in the AS_HOME bin directory can be used to check whether the JMS provider is up and running. The command is:  % asadmin jms-ping  A status report such as:  JMS Ping Status = RUNNING Command jms-ping executed successfully.  indicates whether the JMS provider is running. The JMS provider should start auto- matically when GlassFish starts, although it is possible to configure GlassFish so that the JMS provider must be started separately. The GlassFish administrative console has a Resources tab and a JMS Resources subtab for creating named Connection Factories for a topic or a queue and named Destination Resources, which are topics or queues. In the code that follows, the name of a connec- tion factory and the name of a queue are used with @Resource annotations.  The MsgSender service relies on dependency injection, enabled through the @Resource annotation, to get the connection factory and the queue created through the GlassFish administrative console. Sending the message requires a connection to the JMS provider, a session with the provider, and a message producer that encapsulates the send method. JMS has several message types, including the TextMessage type used here. Once the message is sent to the queue, the session is closed but the connection to the JMS pro- vider remains open for subsequent operations against the queue. The MsgReceiver service uses the same dependency injection code. The setup is also similar except that a QueueSession replaces a generic Session object. To show some of  Java Web Services and Java Message Service  263  Download at Boykma.Com   the  variety  in  the  JMS  API,  a  QueueReceiver  is  introduced.  The  invocation  of  the QueueConnection method start completes the setup phase and enables the message at the front of queue, if there is one, to be retrieved. Here is the code:  package ch06.jms;  import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList; import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod; import javax.jms.Message; import javax.jms.TextMessage; import javax.jms.Session; import javax.jms.Queue; import javax.jms.QueueSession; import javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory; import javax.jms.QueueConnection; import javax.jms.QueueSession; import javax.jms.QueueReceiver; import javax.jms.JMSException; import javax.annotation.Resource;  @WebService public class MsgReceiver {        name and mappedName can differ     @Resource name="qcf", mappedName="qcf"      private QueueConnectionFactory qf;     @Resource name="jmsQ", mappedName="jmsQ"      private Queue queue;      private QueueConnection conn;      @WebMethod     public String receive   {         String cliche = null;         try {             if  conn == null  conn = qf.createQueueConnection  ;             QueueSession session =                 conn.createQueueSession false,                                         Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;             QueueReceiver receiver = session.createReceiver queue ;             conn.start  ;              Message msg = receiver.receiveNoWait  ;             if  msg != null && msg instanceof TextMessage   {                 TextMessage tmsg =  TextMessage  msg;                 cliche = tmsg.getText  .trim  ;             }         }         catch JMSException e  { throw new RuntimeException e ; }         return cliche;     } }  264  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com   There are three JMS methods for retrieving a message from a queue. This example uses receiveNoWait, which behaves as the name indicates: the method returns the message at the front of the queue, if there is one, but immediately returns null, if the queue is empty. There is also an overloaded receives method. The no-argument version blocks until there is a message to retrieve, whereas the one-argument version blocks only n milliseconds, for n > 0, if the queue is currently empty. JMS  also  has  a  MessageListener  interface,  which  declares  an  onMessage Message  method. A message consumer such a QueueReceiver has a setMessageListener method whose argument is an instance of a class that implements the MessageListener interface. The onMessage method then behaves as a callback that is invoked whenever a message arrives for consumption. Within the Java community, there is ongoing interest in the interaction between JWS and JMS. For example, there is a third-party initiative to provide a SOAP over JMS binding. Even without this initiative, of course, a SOAP envelope could be encapsulated as the body of a JMS message; or a JMS message could be encapsulated as the cargo of a SOAP envelope. There also are packages for converting between JMS and SOAP. The example  in  this  section  emphasizes  the  store-and-forward  capabilities  of  JMS  and shows how these might be integrated with SOAP-based web services.  WS-Security Under GlassFish The  Echo  service  example  in  Chapter  5  shows  that  WS-Security  can  be  used  with Endpoint by using the Metro packages. WS-Security is easier under GlassFish precisely because the current Metro release is part of the GlassFish distribution. This section illustrates the point.  Making an HTTP Dump Automatic Under GlassFish  In any GlassFish deployment domain such as domain1, there is a subdirectory config with various files, including domain.xml. This configuration file has a section for JVM options, each of which has the start tag  . To enable an automatic HTTP dump of the SOAP messages and their security artifacts, two JVM options should be added:      -Dcom.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.HttpAdapter.dump=true       -Dcom.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.client.HttpTransportPipe.dump=true          If the application server is already running, it must be restarted for the new configura- tion to take effect. The dump is to the domains domain1 logs server.log file.  The first example focuses on peer authentication using digital certificates.  WS-Security Under GlassFish  265  Download at Boykma.Com   Mutual Challenge with Digital Certificates In a typical browser-based web application, the browser challenges the web server to authenticate itself when the browser tries to establish an HTTPS connection with the server. As discussed earlier in Chapter 5, the web server typically does not challenge the client. For instance, the default behavior of Tomcat is not to challenge a client. GlassFish as a whole has the same default behavior. In the administrative console, under the Security tab, this default behavior can be changed so that GlassFish, including embedded Tomcat, challenges the client automatically. The approach in this example is to force the challenge at the application level rather than for the JAS as a whole. In any case, a challenged party may respond with digital certificates that vouch for its identity. This section illustrates mutual challenge using digital certificates, a scenario that the acronym MCS  Mutual Certificates Security  captures. Recall the scenario in which Alice wants to send a message securely to Bob, with each of the two relying upon digital certificates to authenticate the identity of the other. Alice’s keystore holds her own digital certificates, which she can send to Bob, whereas Alice’s truststore holds digital certificates that establish her trust in Bob. Alice’s trust- store may contain earlier verified certificates from Bob or certificates from a CA that vouch for Bob’s certificates. For convenience in testing, the keystore and truststore could be the same file. There are two ways to do an MCS application. One way is to rely directly on HTTPS, which incorporates mutual challenge as part of the setup phase in establishing a secure communications channel between the client and the web service. On the client side, CLIENT-CERT can be used instead of BASIC or DIGEST authentication so that the client, like the server, presents a digital certificate to vouch for its identity. The second way is to be transport-agnostic and rely instead on mutual challenge with Metro’s WSIT support.  Recall that the I in WSIT is for Interoperability, which includes transport neutrality.  Each way is illustrated with an example. The HTTPS example implements the web service with an EJB endpoint, whereas the WSIT example implements the web service with a servlet endpoint.  MCS Under HTTPS The source code for the web service is neutral with respect to security and so could be deployed under either HTTP or HTTPS:  package ch06.sslWS;  import javax.ejb.Stateless; import javax.jws.WebService;  @Stateless @WebService public class EchoSSL {     public String echo String msg  { return "Echoing: " + msg; } }  266  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com   The EchoSSL service is first deployed without any security to underscore that a secured version does not require changes to the source code. The wsimport artifacts can be generated in the usual way from the unsecured version or, using wsgen, from the secured version. In any case, GlassFish awaits HTTPS connections on port 8181. Security  for  the  EchoSSL  service  is  imposed  with  a  GlassFish-specific  configuration file, sun-ejb-jar.xml:    <!DOCTYPE sun-ejb-jar PUBLIC '-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.             DTD Sun ONE Application Server 8.0 EJB 2.1  EN'           'http:  www.sun.com software sunone appserver            dtds sun-ejb-jar_2_1-0.dtd'>                    EchoSSL                   EchoSSL                       CLIENT-CERT             certificate                     CONFIDENTIAL                       The security section of this configuration file is essentially the same as the security- constraint  section  of  a  web.xml  file.  Two  sections  of  interest  are  the  login-config section, which sets the authentication to  CLIENT-CERT, and the  transport-guarantee section, which calls for data confidentiality across the communications channel. This configuration file is included in the JAR file that holds the compiled web service, in this example  echoSSL.jar.  The  name  of  the  JAR  file  is  arbitrary,  but  the  file  sun-ejb- jar.xml must be in the META-INF directory within the JAR file. Here, then, is the layout of the JAR file:  META-INF sun-ejb-jar.xml ch06 sslWS EchoSSL.class        The JAR file with the configuration document and the stateless EJB is then put in an EAR file as usual. As earlier examples show, an EAR file does not require a configuration document, but the standard configuration document is named application.xml. Here, for illustration, is the configuration document used in this example:    <!DOCTYPE application PUBLIC "-  Sun Micro., Inc.  DTD J2EE Application 1.3  EN"            "http:  java.sun.com dtd application_1_3.dtd">      EchoSSL           echoSSL.jar   WS-Security Under GlassFish  267  Download at Boykma.Com                The META-INF application.xml file is a manifest that lists each JAR file within the EAR file as a module that belongs to the application as a whole. In this case, then, the appli- cation consists of the stateless EJB in echoSSL.jar. Once created, the EAR file is deployed as usual by being copied to domains domain1 autodeploy. The client code, like the service code, provides no hint that the client must connect over HTTPS:  import clientSSL.EchoSSLService; import clientSSL.EchoSSL;  class EchoSSLClient {     public static void main String[ ] args  {        try {           EchoSSLService service = new EchoSSLService  ;           EchoSSL port = service.getEchoSSLPort  ;           System.out.println port.echo "Goodbye, cruel world!"  ;        }         catch Exception e  { System.err.println e ; }     } }    Although the client code is straightforward, its execution requires information about the client’s keystore and truststore. GlassFish itself provides a default keystore and truststore for development mode. The keystore and the truststore for domain1 are in domains domain1 config and are named keystore.jks and cacerts.jks, respectively. The keystore contains a self-signed certificate. In production mode, of course, a CA-signed certificate presumably would be used. To make testing as easy as possible, the client is simply invoked with the GlassFish keystore and truststore. Here is the execution com- mand with the output:  The underlying SOAP messages are also indistinguishable from those sent over HTTP:  % java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=cacerts.jks \        -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit \        -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=keystore.jks \        -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=changeit EchoSSLClient Echoing: Goodbye, cruel world!                                Goodbye, cruel world!                The security does not show up at the SOAP level because the security is provided at the transport level; that is, through HTTPS. Only the configuration documents indicate  268  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com   that MCS is in play. In the WSIT example that follows, the SOAP messages will change dramatically because the security occurs at the SOAP level.  MCS Under WSIT For variety, the MCS client is now a servlet that receives a text input from a browser or the equivalent and invokes the EchoService method echo with this string as the argu- ment.  The  servlet  responds  to  the  browser  with  the  string  returned  from  the  echo method. HTTP comes into play only in connecting the client’s browser to the servlet container. Within the servlet container, the EchoService and the EchoClient servlet do exchange SOAP messages, but not over HTTP  see Figure 6-3 .  Figure 6-3. Mutual challenge under WS-Security  WSIT MCS is introduced into the application through configuration files. These files are sufficiently complicated that it may be best to generate them with a tool. The Net- Beans IDE suits the purpose by producing the configuration files and the related Ant scripts that handle compilation, packaging, and deployment. It should be emphasized again, however, that this and any other WSIT application can be done without the NetBeans IDE. The @WebService is now servlet rather than EJB-based, although this change by itself plays no role in the MCS. Here is the source:  package ch06.mcs;  import javax.jws.WebService; import javax.jws.WebMethod;  @WebService public class Echo {     @WebMethod     public String echo String msg  { return "Echoing: " + msg; } }  The client is a servlet that uses the usual wsimport-generated artifacts:  package ch06.mcs.client;  import java.io.PrintWriter; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.Closeable; import javax.annotation.Resource;  WS-Security Under GlassFish  269  Client browser  index.html  Web container  EchoClient servlet EchoService WS  HTTP  Download at Boykma.Com   import javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; import javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef; import javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPFaultException;  public class EchoClient extends HttpServlet {     @WebServiceRef wsdlLocation = "http:  localhost:8080 echoMCS EchoService?wsdl"      public EchoService service;      public void doGet HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res  {         res.setContentType "text html;charset=UTF-8" ;         PrintWriter out = null;         try {             out = res.getWriter  ;             out.println " EchoServlet: " + req.getContextPath   + " " ;                 Get the port reference and invoke echo method.             Echo port = service.getEchoPort  ;             String result = port.echo req.getParameter "msg"  ;                 If there's no SOAP fault so far, authentication worked.             out.println " Authentication OK  " ;             out.println result ;             out.flush  ;               Closeable  port .close  ;    close connection to service         }         catch  SOAPFaultException e  {             out.println "Authentication failure: " + e ;         }         catch  Exception e  { out.println e ; }         finally { out.close  ; }     }      public void doPost HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res  {         try {             this.doGet req, res ;    shouldn't happen but just in case :          }         catch Exception e  { throw new RuntimeException "doPost" ; }     } }  The servlet container honors the @WebServiceRef annotation, shown in bold, and ini- tializes the EchoService reference service. Once the web service operation echo has been invoked and the response sent back to the browser, the EchoClient closes the port to signal to the container that further access to the web service is not required on this request. The EchoClient servlet is invoked on each submission of the simple HTML form in which a client enters a phrase to be echoed. For completeness, here is the form:  270  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com                          EchoService Client                                                               Nothing so far indicates that MCS is in play. It is the configuration documents alone that  introduce  MCS  into  the  application.  Each  side,  the  Echo  web  service  and  the EchoClient servlet, has a small sun-web.xml that provides the container with the context root, which is the name of the deployed WAR file. Following is the document for the EchoClient:    <!DOCTYPE sun-web-app PUBLIC      "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Application Server 9.0 Servlet 2.5  EN"      "http:  www.sun.com software appserver dtds sun-web-app_2_5-0.dtd">       echoClient           The sun-web.xml documents reside in the WEB-INF directory of each deployed WAR file. There is a second configuration document, which is considered next. The major MCS configuration document for the service and its client begins with wsit-: wsit-ch06.mcs.Echo.xml in the case of the web service and wsit-client.xml in the case of the  client.  Each  document  has  the  structure  of  a  WSDL.   However,  wsit-client.xml imports another document, which contains most of the configuration information.  On the web service side, the document resides in the WEB-INF directory; on the client side, the document resides in the WEB-INF classes META-INF directory. Here is the service-side wsit-ch06.mcs.Echo.xml:    <definitions  xmlns="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org wsdl "  xmlns:wsdl="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org wsdl "  xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"

Of interest here is that much of this detail pertains to areas in the SOAP header that need to be encrypted and digitally signed. In any case, a docu- ment as complicated as this is best generated using a tool such as the one embedded in the NetBeans IDE rather than written by hand. The client version, the document WEB-INF classes META-INF EchoService.xml, is less complicated:    <definitions   xmlns:wsu=   "http:  docs.oasis-open.org wss 2004 01 oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd"   xmlns:wsp="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org ws 2004 09 policy"   xmlns:soap="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org wsdl soap "   xmlns:tns="http:  mcs.ch06 "   xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"   xmlns="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org wsdl "   targetNamespace="http:  mcs.ch06 "   name="EchoService"   xmlns:sc="http:  schemas.sun.com 2006 03 wss client"   xmlns:wspp="http:  java.sun.com xml ns wsit policy">                        274  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com            <xsd:import            namespace="http:  mcs.ch06 "            schemaLocation="http:  localhost:8080 echoMCS EchoService?xsd=1">                                                                                                                                                              <soap:binding transport="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap http"                       style="document">                                                                                                                                                                   <soap:address             location="http:  localhost:8080 echoMCS EchoService">                                                                                                                                                <sc:TrustStore wspp:visibility="private"                                    peeralias="xws-security-server" >                                  The section in bold gives the username, in this case wsitUser, and the password for accessing the server’s file-based security realm. The GlassFish command:  % asadmin list-file-users  WS-Security Under GlassFish  275  Download at Boykma.Com   can be used to get a list of authorized users. The output should include wsitUser for the mutual challenge to succeed. The servlet-based Echo web service and its servlet client EchoClient are packaged in separate WAR files and deployed as usual. Here is a dump of each WAR file, starting with the service’s echoMCS.war  the leftmost column is the file size in bytes :    71 META-INF MANIFEST.MF 2488 WEB-INF web.xml 2506 WEB-INF sun-web.xml 6704 WEB-INF wsit-ch06.mcs.Echo.xml  558 WEB-INF classes ch06 mcs Echo.class  Although the MCS configuration document has the structure of a WSDL, GlassFish generates the WSDL available to clients in the usual way. The WSDL is essentially the same as wsit-ch06.mcs.Echo.xml, but the two do differ in some minor details. Here is the structure of the client WAR file, echoClient.war:    71 META-INF MANIFEST.MF  698 WEB-INF web.xml  305 WEB-INF sun-web.xml  745 WEB-INF classes ch06 mcs client Echo.class 1583 WEB-INF classes ch06 mcs client ObjectFactory.class  646 WEB-INF classes ch06 mcs client Echo_Type.class  734 WEB-INF classes ch06 mcs client EchoResponse.class  237 WEB-INF classes ch06 mcs client package-info.class 1484 WEB-INF classes ch06 mcs client EchoService.class 2042 WEB-INF classes ch06 mcs client EchoClient.class  381 WEB-INF classes META-INF wsit-client.xml 2590 WEB-INF classes META-INF EchoService.xml  The WAR file includes the wsimport-generated classes. The wsit-client.xml file does little more than import EchoService.xml.  The Dramatic SOAP Envelopes MCS requires relatively large and complicated SOAP envelopes precisely because the security is now at the SOAP message level rather than at the transport level. The SOAP envelope under MCS needs to include information about encryption algorithms, mes- sage digest algorithms, digital signature algorithms, security tokens, time stamps, and so on. All of this information is packaged in a SOAP header block, which is marked with mustUnderstand set to true; hence, intermediaries and the ultimate receiver must be able to process the header block in some application-appropriate way or else throw a SOAP fault. Here, for dramatic effect, is the request SOAP envelope from a sample EchoClient request against the EchoService:    <S:Envelope xmlns:S="http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope "

p2TQL4JqgBCWh9Jiv6PWikJ0beMuNDvj1wH...                       A summary of the under-the-hood steps that produce this SOAP request document should help to clarify the document:    GlassFish includes a Secure Token Service  STS , which is at the center of the mu- tual authentication between the EchoService and its EchoClient. The STS receives client requests for security tokens. If a request is honored, the STS sends a SAML  Security Assertion Markup Language  token back to the client. SAML is an XML language customized for security assertions. The client can use this token to au- thenticate itself to a web service. In this example, the EchoClient servlet requires a registered username  in this case, wsitUser  in order to get a SAML token from the GlassFish STS. This first step establishes trust among the servlet client, the STS, and the web service.    The servlet client and web service exchange X.509 digital certificates in the process of mutual challenge or authentication. Recall that these certificates include a digital signature, typically from a certificate authority. In test mode, the certificate may be self-signed. The X.509 certificate also includes the public key from the owner’s key pair. The role of the digital signature is to vouch for the identity of the public key. This second step establishes a secure conversation between the client and the web service, as each side is now confident about the identity of the other.    The data exchanged between the client and the web service are packaged, of course, in SOAP envelopes and must be encrypted for confidentiality. In the SOAP request shown earlier, the encrypted data are shown in bold and occur in elements tagged as xenc:CipherData  The complexity makes sense given that WSIT cannot rely on the transport level  in particular, HTTPS  for any aspect of the overall security. Instead, WSIT must use the SOAP messages themselves in support of trust, secure conversation, and data confi- dentiality between the client and the web service. This example drives home the point because the servlet client and the web service do not communicate over HTTPS.  Benefits of JAS Deployment For Java web services, Endpoint is a lightweight publisher; a standalone web container such as Tomcat is a middleweight publisher; and an application server such as GlassFish is a heavyweight publisher. Throughout software, heavyweight connotes complicated; hence, it may be useful to wind up with a review of what recommends a full application server despite the complications that come with this choice. Here is a short review of  280  Chapter 6: JAX-WS in Java Application Servers  Download at Boykma.Com   the advantages that an application server offers for deploying web services, SOAP-based or REST-style:    A web service can be implemented as stateless EJB. The EJB container offers serv- ices, in particular thread safety and container-managed transactions, that neither Endpoint nor a web container offer as is. A production-grade web service is likely to rely on a data store accessible through @Entity instances; and EntityManager methods such as find and persist are not inherently thread-safe but become so if the EntityManager is instantiated as an EJB field.    A JAS typically furnishes a web interface to inspect the WSDL and to test any @WebMethod. GlassFish provides these and other development tools in its adminis- trative console.    An application server includes an RDBMS, which is Java DB in the case of Glass-  Fish. Other database systems can be plugged in as preferred.    An enterprise application deployed in an application server can contain an arbitrary mix of components, which may include interactive servlet-based web applications, EJBs,  message  topics queues  and  listeners,  @Entity  classes,  and  web  services. Components packaged in the same EAR file share an ENC  Enterprise Naming Context , which makes JNDI lookups straightforward.    Application servers typically provide extensive administrative support, which in- cludes support for logging and debugging. The GlassFish administrative console is an example.    GlassFish in particular is the reference implementation of an application server and includes Metro with all of the attendant support for web services interoperability.   A deployed web service, like any other enterprise component, can be part of a  clustered application.  What’s Next? The debate over SOAP-based and REST-style web services is often heated. Each ap- proach has its merits and represents a useful tool in the modern programmer’s toolbox. Most SOAP-based services are delivered over HTTP or HTTPS and, as earlier examples show, therefore qualify as a special type of REST-style service. There is no need to pick sides between SOAP and REST. The next and final chapter takes a short look back into the recent history of distributed systems to gain a clearer view of the choices in devel- oping web services.  What’s Next?   281  Download at Boykma.Com   Download at Boykma.Com   CHAPTER 7 Beyond the Flame Wars  The debate within the web services community is often heated and at times intemperate as the advocates of SOAP-based and REST-style services tout the merits of one ap- proach and rail against the demerits of the other. Whatever the dramatic appeal of a SOAP versus REST conflict, the two approaches can coexist peacefully and produc- tively. There is no hard choice here—no  either one or the other but not both. Each approach has its appeal, and either is better than legacy approaches to distributed soft- ware systems. A quick look at the history of distributed systems is one way to gain perspective on the matter.  A Very Short History of Web Services Web services evolved from the RPC  Remote Procedure Call  mechanism in DCE  Dis- tributed  Computing  Environment ,  a  framework  for  software  development  that emerged in the early 1990s. DCE included a distributed file system  DCE DFS  and a Kerberos-based authentication system. Although DCE has its origins in the Unix world, Microsoft quickly did its own implementation known as MSRPC, which in turn served as the infrastructure for interprocess communication in Windows. Microsoft’s COM  OLE  Common Object Model Object Linking and Embedding  technologies and serv- ices were built on a DCE RPC foundation. The first-generation frameworks for dis- tributed-object systems, CORBA  Common Object Request Broker Architecture  and Microsoft’s  DCOM   Distributed  COM ,  are  anchored  in  the  DCE RPC  procedural framework. Java RMI also derives from DCE RPC, and the method calls in the original EJB types, Session and Entity, are Java RMI calls. Java EE and Microsoft’s .NET, the second-generation frameworks for distributed-object systems, likewise trace their an- cestry back to DCE RPC. Various popular system utilities  for instance, the Samba file and print service for Windows clients  use DCE RPC. DCE RPC has the familiar client server architecture in which a client invokes a proce- dure that executes on the server. Arguments can be passed from the client to the server and  return  values  can  be  passed  from  the  server  to  the  client.  The  framework  is language-neutral  in  principle,  although  strongly  biased  toward  C C++  in  practice.  283  Download at Boykma.Com   DCE RPC includes utilities for generating client and server artifacts  stubs and skele- tons, respectively  and software libraries that hide the transport details. Of interest now is the IDL  Interface Definition Language  document that acts as the service contract and is an input to utilities that generate artifacts in support of the DCE RPC calls.  The Service Contract in DCE RPC Here is a simple IDL file:   * echo.idl *  [uuid 2d6ead46-05e3-11ca-7dd1-426909beabcd , version 1.0 ] interface echo {     const long int ECHO_SIZE = 512;     void echo          [in]             handle_t h,         [in,  string]    idl_char from_client[ ],         [out, string]    idl_char from_server[ECHO_SIZE]      ; }  The interface, identified with a machine-generated UUID, declares a single function of three arguments, two of which are in parameters  that is, inputs to the remote proce- dure   and  one  of  which  is  an  out  parameter   that  is,  an  output  from  the  remote procedure . The first argument, of defined type handle_t, is required and points to an RPC binding structure. The function echo could but does not return a value because the echoed string is returned instead as an out parameter. The IDL, though obviously not in XML format, is functionally akin to a WSDL. The IDL file is passed through an IDL compiler  for instance, the Windows midl utility  to generate the appropriate client-side or server-side artifacts. Here is a C client that invokes the echo procedure remotely:  include      * standard C header file *  include    * DCE RPC header file *   int main int argc, char* argv[ ]  {      * DCE RPC data types *      rpc_ns_handle_t import_context;     handle_t        binding_h;     error_status_t  status;     idl_char        reply[ECHO_SIZE + 1];      char* msg = "Hello, world!";       * Set up RPC. *      rpc_ns_binding_import_begin rpc_c_ns_syntax_default,                                  unsigned_char_p_t  argv[1],  * server id *                                   echo_v1_0_c_ifspec,                                  0,                                  &import_context,                                  &status ;  284  Chapter 7: Beyond the Flame Wars  Download at Boykma.Com       check_status_maybe_die status, "import_begin" ;  * code not shown *       rpc_ns_binding_import_next import_context,                                &binding_h,                                &status ;     check_status_maybe_die status, "import_next" ;       * Make the remote call.  *      echo binding_h,  idl_char*  msg, reply ;     printf "%s echoed from server: %s\n", msg, reply ;      return 0; }  The setup code at the start is a bit daunting, but the call itself is straightforward. The IDL file plays a central role in Microsoft’s ActiveX technology. An ActiveX control is basically a DLL  Dynamic Link Library  with an embedded typelib, which is a com- piled IDL file. So an ActiveX control is a DLL that carries along its own RPC interface, which means that the control can be embedded dynamically in a host application  for instance, a browser  that can consume the typelib to determine how to invoke the calls implemented in the DLL. This is a preview of how the client of a SOAP-based web service will consume a WSDL. DCE RPC is an important step toward language-agnostic distributed systems but has some obvious, if understandable, drawbacks. For one, DCE RPC uses a proprietary transport, which is understandable in a pioneering technology that predates HTTP by almost a decade. My point is not to evaluate DCE RPC but rather to highlight simi- larities between it and its descendant, SOAP-based web services. To that end, XML- RPC is the next SOAP ancestor to consider.  XML-RPC Dave Winer of UserLand Software developed XML-RPC in the late 1990s. XML-RPC is a very lightweight RPC system with support for elementary data types  basically, the built-in C types together with a boolean and a datetime type  and a few simple com- mands. The original specification is about seven pages in length. The two key features are the use of XML marshaling unmarshaling to achieve language neutrality and reli- ance on HTTP  and, later, SMTP  for transport. The O’Reilly open-wire Meerkat serv- ice is an XML-RPC application. As an RPC technology, XML-RPC follows the request response pattern. Here is the XML request from an invocation of the Fibonacci function with an argument of 11, which is passed as a four-byte integer:      ch07.fib        11        A Very Short History of Web Services   285  Download at Boykma.Com   XML-RPC is deliberately low fuss and very lightweight. For an XML-RPC fan, SOAP is XML-RPC after a prolonged eating binge.  Standardized SOAP Perhaps  the  most  compelling  way  to  contrast  the  simplicity  of  XML-RPC  with  the complexity of SOAP is to list the categories for SOAP-related standards initiatives and the number of initiatives in each category.  An amusing poster of these standards is available at http:  www.innoq.com resources ws-standards-poster.  Table 7-1 shows the list.  Table 7-1. Standards for SOAP-based web services  Category Interoperability Security Metadata Messaging Business Process Resource Translation XML Management SOAP Presentation  Number of standard initiatives 10 10 9 9 7 7 7 7 4 3 1  The total of 74 distinct but related initiatives helps explain the charge that SOAP-based web services are over-engineered. Some of the standards  for instance, those in the Business Process category  represent an effort to make web services more useful and practical.  Others   for  instance,  those  in  the  categories  of  Interoperability,  Security, Metadata, and SOAP itself  underscore the goal of language, platform, and transport neutrality for SOAP-based services. Recall the examples in Chapter 6 of mutual chal- lenge security  MCS  using digital certificates. If the MCS is done under HTTPS, the setup is minimal and the exchanged SOAP envelopes carry no security information whatever. If the MCS is done under WSIT, the setup is tricky and the exchanged SOAP envelopes have relatively large, complicated header blocks that encapsulate security credentials and supporting materials. However, WSIT complexity can be avoided, in this case, by letting HTTPS transport carry the MCS load. Despite the complexities, even SOAP-based services are an evolutionary advance.  286  Chapter 7: Beyond the Flame Wars  Download at Boykma.Com   SOAP-Based Web Services Versus Distributed Objects Java RMI  including the Session and Entity EJB constructs built on it  and .NET Re- moting are examples of second-generation distributed object systems. Consider what a Java RMI client requires to invoke a method declared in a service interface such as this:  package ch07.doa;     distributed object architecture import java.util.List; public interface BenefitsService extends java.rmi.Remote {    public List  getBenefits Emp emp  throws RemoteException; }  The client needs a Java RMI stub, an instance of a class that implements the interface BenefitsService. The stub is downloaded automatically to the client through seriali- zation over the socket that connects the client and the service. The stub class requires the programmer-defined Emp and EmpBenefits types, which in turn may nest other pro- grammer-defined types, e.g., Department, BusinessCertification, and ClientAccount:  public class Emp {    private Department                   department;    private List   certifications;    private List           accounts;    ... }  The standard Java types such as List already are available on the client side, as the client is, by assumption, a Java application. The challenge involves the programmer- defined types such as Emp and EmpBenefits that are needed to support the client-side invocation of a remotely executed method, as this code segment illustrates:  List  fred_benefits = remote_object.getBenefits fred ;    Under Java RMI, programmer-defined types required on the client side are loaded re- motely and automatically. Yet the remote loading of Java classes is inherently compli- cated and, of course, the format of Java’s .class files is proprietary. The point is that lots of stuff needs to come down from the server to the client before the client can invoke a method remotely. The arguments passed to the Java RMI service  in this example, the Emp instance to which fred refers  are serialized on the client side and deserialized on the service side. The returned value, in this case a list of EmpBenefits, is serialized by  the  service  and  deserialized  by  the  client.  The  client  and  service  communicate through  binary  rather  than  text  streams,  and  the  structure  of  the  binary  streams  is specific to Java. SOAP-based web services simplify matters. For one thing, the client and service now exchange XML documents: text in the form of SOAP envelopes.  In special cases, raw bytes  can  be  exchanged  instead.   The  exchanged  text  can  be  inspected,  validated, transformed, persisted, and otherwise processed using readily available and often free tools. Each side, client and service, simply needs a local software library that binds language-specific  types  such  as  the  Java  String  to  XML  Schema   or  comparable  language-neutral types, in this case xsd:string. Given these bindings, relatively simple  SOAP-Based Web Services Versus Distributed Objects   287  Download at Boykma.Com   library modules can serialize and deserialize. Processing on the client side, as on the service side, requires only locally available libraries and utilities. The complexities can be isolated at the endpoints and need not seep into the exchanged SOAP messages. As noted repeatedly, the client and the service need not be coded in the same language or even in the same style of language. Clients and services can be implemented in object- oriented, procedural, functional, and other language styles. The languages on either end may be statically typed  for instance, Java and C  or dynamically typed  for ex- ample, Perl and Ruby , although it is easier to generate a WSDL from a service coded in a statically typed language. Further, SOAP insulates the client and the service from platform-specific details. Life gets simpler and proportionately better with the move from distributed objects to SOAP-based web services.  SOAP and REST in Harmony From a programmer’s standpoint, there are two profoundly different ways to do SOAP- based web services. The first way, which dominates in practice, is to assume HTTP  HTTPS transport and to let the transport carry as much of the load as possible. In this approach, the transport handles requirements such as reliable messaging, peer authen- tication, and confidentiality. The second way, which accounts for much of the com- plexity in the WS-* initiatives, requires the programmer to deal with the many APIs that address transport-neutral services. The first way is certainly my preferred way. If HTTP HTTPS is assumed as transport, then SOAP-based web services in the predominant request response pattern are just a special case of RESTful services: a client request is a POSTed SOAP envelope, and a service response is likewise a SOAP envelope. The very good news is that the SOAP envelopes are mostly transparent to the programmer, who does not have to generate the XML on the sending side or to parse the XML on the receiving side. The client examples in Chapter 4, on RESTful services, illustrate the point. In every client, the bulk of the code is devoted to XML processing. Transparent XML sounds like an empty slogan only to someone who has not had to deal directly with large and complicated XML dcouments. From the programmer’s viewpoint, the SOAP-based approach also has the enormous appeal of a service contract, a WSDL, that can be used to generate client-side artifacts that standardize the task of writing the client. Indeed, the major drawback of RESTful services in general is the lack of a uniform service contract that facilitates coding the client. An XML Schema is a grammar, not a service contract. Of course, the grammar can guide the programmer in parsing a response XML document to extract the items of interest; but this is little consolation to the programmer if every RESTful service has its own idiosyncratic response document, not to mention its own distinctive invocation syntax. The next big step for the RESTful community is to agree on a format, such as the WADL document, to act as a service contract. Imagine the boost that the RESTful  288  Chapter 7: Beyond the Flame Wars  Download at Boykma.Com   style would enjoy from a lightweight service contract that could be used to generate client-side artifacts. SOAP-based  and  REST-style  services  present  different  challenges  but  likewise  offer different opportunities. The SOAP-based approach mostly hides the XML, whereas the REST-style approach typically requires that the XML be front and center. The SOAP- based approach does not take direct advantage of what HTTP offers, although the SOAP  in  SOAP-based  services  is  almost  always  delivered  over  HTTP HTTPS.  The RESTful approach obviously exploits what HTTP HTTPS offers but, so far, does little to ease the task of processing the XML payloads. Let’s hope that a unified approach to RESTful services will be forthcoming. Until then my two cents still will be spent on RESTful services—and on SOAP-based ones deliv- ered over HTTP HTTPS.

Colophon The animal on the cover of Java Web Services: Up and Running is a great cormorant  Phalacrocorax carbo . This bird is a common member of the Phalacrocoracidae family, which  consists  of  about  40  species  of  cormorants  and  shags—large  seabirds  with hooked bills, colored throats, and stiff tail feathers. The name “cormorant” is derived from the Latin corvus marinus, or sea raven, because of its black plumage. An adult cormorant is about 30 inches long and has a wingspan of 60 inches. It has a long neck, a yellow throat, and a white chin patch. The cormorant has a distinctive way of spreading its wings as it perches, which many naturalists believe is a way of drying its feathers, although this explanation is disputed. The cormorant lives mainly near Atlantic waters, on western European and eastern North American coasts, and partic- ularly on the Canadian maritime provinces. It breeds on cliffs or in trees, building nests out of twigs and seaweed. The cormorant is an excellent fisher, able to dive to great depths. In China and Japan, among other places, fishermen have trained this bird using a centuries-old method, in which  they  tie  cords  around  the  throats  of  the  birds—to  prevent  them  from swallowing—and send them out from boats. The cormorants then catch fish in their mouths, return to the boats, and the fishermen retrieve their catch. Alhough once a successful industry, today cormorant fishing is primarily used for tourism.

Learn how to develop REST-style and SOAP-based web services and clients with this quick and thorough introduction. This hands-on book delivers a clear, pragmatic approach to web services by providing an architectural overview, complete working code examples, and short yet precise instructions for compiling, deploying, and executing them. You'll learn how to write services from scratch and integrate existing services into your Java applications. With greater emphasis on REST-style services, this second edition covers HttpServlet, Restlet, and JAX-RS APIs; jQuery clients against REST-style services; and JAX-WS for SOAP-based services. Code samples include an Apache Ant script that compiles, packages, and deploys web services
