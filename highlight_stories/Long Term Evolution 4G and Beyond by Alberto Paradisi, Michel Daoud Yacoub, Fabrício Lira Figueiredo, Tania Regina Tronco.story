Whereas in the beginning the use  of mobile phone was restricted to those few who could afford to buy equipment  and  services,  today  its  widespread  use  has  made  it  unconceivable  for  anyone  to  live without it. The number of wireless services subscriptions has long surpassed  those of the fixed telephone lines with users eager to make use of and demanding  new wireless features. It is now reasonably correct to say that new generations of  wireless systems appear in every ten years although equipment and services evolve  in a much faster pace.  First-Generation   1G   wireless  networks  appeared  in  the  late  1970s.  The  aim  was to provide voice services to mobile subscribers. The systems had as their main  features  voice  transmission  over  analogue  frequency  modulation   FM   channels  and  frequency  division  multiple  access   FDMA   as  multiple  access  architecture.  They  operated  over  the  800–900  MHz,  although  one  or  another  could  be  found  in  the  450  MHz  band.  Capacity  expansion  was  rather  limited  and  privacy  was  inexistent. The best representatives of these systems are: advanced mobile phone  service   AMPS   in  North America;  total  access  communication  system   TACS ,  European  TACS   ETACS ,  and  nordic  mobile  telephony   NMT   in  Europe;  Japanese TACS  JTACS  in Japan. Soon, there was the need for more spectrum- efficient and more advanced wireless networks.  As early as in the 1980s, the buzzwords “personal”, “anywhere, anytime” per- meated  talks,  speeches,  papers,  and  all  things  concerning  wireless  communica- tions.  Researchers  and  engineers  alike  freed  their  imagination  to  conceive  a  wireless system that would fulfil the requirements of a personal communication,  available  to  anyone,  anywhere,  anytime.  That  would  constitute  the  Second- Generation   2G   wireless  networks,  available  in  the  early  1990s.  Of  course,  the  expectations  for  the  predicted  services  were  only  partially  attained. The  2G  sys- tems  were  indeed  able  to  increase  spectral  efficiency  as  well  as  introduce  some  kind of privacy but were far from what everyone thought it would really be. They  provided  robust  communications,  authentication  capability,  low-speed  data  in   v   vi  Preface  addition  to  voice  services. The  systems  used  digital  transmission  techniques  and  time division multiple access  TDMA  or code division multiple access  CDMA   as  multiple  access  architectures. The  best  representatives  of  these  systems  were:  Global System for Mobile communications  GSM  with its data service aggregate  general  packet  radio  service   GPRS 1,  and  Digital  AMPS—IS-136   D-AMPS ,  using TDMA, and CDMA-One  IS-95 , using CDMA. In addition to the 800–900  MHz band, GSM inaugurated the use of the 1.8 GHz band. GSM soon became a  universally adopted 2G network.  The  widespread  use  of  the  Internet  boosted  the  development  of  wireless  sys- tems  able  to  provide  better  data-transmission  capability  for  mobile  applications.  The  Third-Generation   3G   networks  were  then  envisaged  by  the  international  mobile  telecommunications-2000   IMT-2000 ,  with  standards  and  specifications  developed  by  several  organizations  under  the  auspices  of  the  international  tele- communications union  ITU . The aim of a 3G system was to deliver a data rate of  2 Mbps for stationary or walking users and 384 kbps for moving vehicles. In fact,  ITU did not clearly specify the minimum required data rate. Hence, different data  rates have been sold as 3G and the systems went commercially in the early 2000s.  Two major systems are commonly branded 3G: universal mobile telecommunica- tions systems  UMTS  and CDMA2000. UMTS, designed for networks based on  GSM,  was  developed  by  the  3rd  generation  partnership  project   3GPP .  It  uses  different  terrestrial  interfaces,  named  UMTS  terrestrial  radio  access   UTRA ,  the  most  popular  being  wideband  CDMA   WCDMA .  UMTS  networks  have  been  improving  their  data-transmission  capability  through  high-speed  downlink   uplink  packet access  HSD U PA  technologies. CDMA2000, designed for net- works based on CDMA-One, was developed by 3GPP2. It includes the 1xEV-DO  technology for broadband Internet access. A combination of CDMA and TDMA  is applied as a means to achieve the desired data-rate transmission. Undoubtedly,  UMTS is the predominant 3G system worldwide.  Clearly,  communications  systems  have  moved  drastically  from  voice  towards  data  applications.  Such  applications  are  increasingly  demanding  higher  data  rates,  which  current  wireless  systems  have  not  been  able  to  provide. A  Fourth- Generation   4G   network  was  necessary.  In  this  sense,  the  ITU-radio  com- munication  sector   ITU-R   established  the  requirements  for  4G  standards,  the  IMT-Advanced.  Some  of  these  requirements  include:   i   be  an  all-IP  packet  switched network;  ii  provide peak data rates of 100 Mbps for high mobility and  1 Gbps for low mobility;  iii  use scalable channel bandwidths of 5–20 MHz; be  able  to  provide  smooth  handover  through  heterogeneous  networks;  etc.  Mobile  WiMAX and long term evolution  LTE , already in use  early 2010s , but which  did not fully comply with the required standards yet are recognized as 4G systems.  In 2009, the LTE-Advanced, standardized by the 3GPP, was formally submitted as  a candidate 4G system.  1GPRS was known as a 2.5G system.   Preface  vii  As usual and ever, a generation is not fully available yet and a vivid discussion  on  the  requirements  for  the  next  generation  is  under  way.  Fifth-Generation   5G   wireless networks aim:  i  to support tens of Mbps for tens of thousands of users;   ii  to support connections for massive sensor deployments;  iii  to meet new use- cases such as internet of things  IoT ; and others. It is predicted that 5G networks  should be rolled out by 2020.  It is certain that what is expected for a given wireless generation is only accom-  plished two or three generations later…  CPqD  has  been  involved  with  wireless  communications  since  the  very  begin- ning. It has been conducting research and development in a wide range of aspects  of the system. In addition, it has been actively participating in the Regulatory and  Standardization  agencies  national  and  internationally.  More  recently,  CPqD  has  led  the  move  in  order  to  standardize  the  introduction  of  the  use  of  450  MHz  in  3GPP,  which  was  officially  established  in  2013. Also  a  Radio Access  Network,  RAN, both in 450 and 700 MHz have been fully developed and tested in labora- tory and also in the field with operators.  This  book  gathers  a  little  of  the  latest  works  in  the  wireless  communications  field at CPqD. Chapter “LTE and Beyond” traces a thorough overview of the cur- rent Long Term Evolution systems and their future. Issues such as fundamentals of  LTE  e.g. architecture, control and user plane protocols, physical layer , advanced  features   e.g.,  spectrum  usage,  efficiency,  capacity ,  interference  management,  advanced  services,  and  others  are  nicely  covered  in  the  text.  Chapter  “Brazilian  Telecommunications Regulatory Framework and the Impacts on the Development  of Broadband Radio Access Systems” the Brazilian Regulatory Framework for tel- ecommunications services is adopted as the basis for an analysis on the impact of  introduction of new technological scenarios and the new opportunities that can be  envisaged. Chapter “Dual-Polarized Crossed Dipole Antenna Array for LTE Base  Station” presents a solution for a dual-polarized antenna array for LTE base sta- tion applications operating in the 450 MHz band. In particular, the antenna oper- ates  with  a ±45   slanted  polarization  diversity  with  a  horizontal  beamwidth  of  65 . Chapter “Evaluation of the LTE 450 MHz System Performance with Different  Terminal Antennas” conducts simulation analysis in order to evaluate the perfor- mance of commercial antennas for LTE systems at 450 MHz. The environment, a  rural area, is chosen to comply with the ANATEl and 3GPP standards. The results  show that the use of directional antennas may improve the cell throughput up to  90 % and terminal throughput up to 10 times as compared to the same scenario  using omnidirectional antennas. Chapter “Wavelet-Based Narrowband Interference  Suppression  in  Long  Term  Evolution  Physical  Channels”  describes  a  wavelet- approach in order to mitigate narrowband interference in LTE physical channels.  Simulations  are  used  that  suggest  that  an  optimized  a  suppression  process  calls  for different wavelet type depending on the physical channel considered. Chapter  “Link Adaptation in LTE Systems” details how link adaptation  selection of modu- lation schemes and code rate  is performed in both downlink and uplink in LTE  systems.  Chapter  “Method  and  Test  Environment  for  the Validation  of  Random    viii  Preface  Access Channel for Long Term Evolution Systems in 450 MHz” proposes a labo- ratory method to validate Physical Random Access CHannel  PRACH  procedure  implemented  in  the  LTE  450  MHz. The  method  avoids  the  costly  and  time-con- suming procedures of field tests. Chapter “Experimental Assessment of Voice Over  IP in LTE Systems Under Different Cell Conditions” depicts a measurement-based  performance assessment of VoIP in LTE networks for suburban and rural applica- tions  when  different  LTE  configurations  of  QoS  and  cell  conditions  are  consid- ered. Chapter “Integration Between LTE and Satellite Networks” investigates the  viability  of  introducing  satellite-based  backhaul  connectivity  to  LTE  networks.  Both laboratory-simulated link as well as real-world link in a LTE 450 MHz sys- tem  is  tested.  The  results  show  that  the  introduction  of  a  satellite  link  does  not  limit the quality of the services provided.  We cordially invite you to enjoy the book.

CPqD is the largest R&D Center in Latin America and is located at Campinas,  São Paulo, Brazil. Since its creation in 1976, CPqD has excelled as the strengthen- ing bond between the universities and the companies, collaborating to develop and  disseminate knowledge  technology  for the industrial sector.  CPqD has built a consistent R&D Program with the purpose of fostering inno- vation  for  the  telecommunications  market,  contributing  to  the  industry  competi- tiveness and minimizing the digital divide within Brazilian society. This program  is  deeply  committed  to  the  applicability  of  their  results,  achieved  by  means  of  projects  that  generate  scientific  and  technical  knowledge,  as  well  as  products,  processes,  systems  or  services  related  to  telecom  and  information  technologies.  It  is  currently  sponsored  by  FUNTTEL—Fund  for  Technological  Development  of  Telecommunications  of  the  Brazilian  Ministry  of  Communications,  FINEP— Financing Agency for Studies and Projects, of the Brazilian Ministry of Science,  Technology and Innovation, Brazilian Development Bank  BNDES  and  Brazilian  Association for Research and Industrial Innovation  EMBRAPII .  During  the  last  years,  CPqD  has  developed  a  complete  LTE  Radio  Access  Network architecture, comprising Base Stations  eNodeB , user equipment  UEs   and evolved packet core  EPC  elements, targeting macrocell and smallcell appli- cations. In case of macrocells, CPqD has recently led the 450 MHz standardiza- tion within 3GPP, now Band 31, together with other companies and with support  of  Brazilian  Communications  Ministry.  Once  operating  in  Band  31,  it  has  been  proven  in  the  field  that  coverage  radius  of  tens  of  kilometers  is  achievable  with  high performance, even at the cell border.

It  gathers  a  selection  of  papers  covering  key  aspects  on  LTE  macrocells for rural and remote area applications, such as system design, function- alities, standardization, performance optimization, system evaluation, and integra- tion with satellite backhaul.  xv   xvi  Introduction to CPqD Research Series  I would like to thank all the authors, and the collaborators Maria Lúcia Herrera,  Michael  Machado  and Tania  Regina Tronco,  whose  valuable  contribution  turned  this book into reality.  Alberto Paradisi   LTE and Beyond  Dick Carrillo, Felipe A.P. de Figueiredo, Fabrício Lira Figueiredo   and João Paulo Miranda  Abstract  In this chapter, we provide a brief yet comprehensive overview of cur- rent  Long  Term  Evolution   LTE   systems  and  beyond.  We  begin  presenting  the  baseline  technology  and  the  underlying  features  of  network  architecture,  proto- cols, and air interface introduced in the first LTE release back in 2008. Having the  basics put in place, we move forward to discuss advanced features introduced and  further developed throughout subsequent LTE releases. Our discussion takes into  consideration even the still under discussion LTE Release 13, which has in March  2016 its estimated freeze date.  1   Introduction  The  wireless  communications  industry  has  been  undergoing  great  developments  since the beginning of this century.

Carrillo et al.   3G   technology,  based  on  wideband  code-division  multiple  access,  increased  data  transmission  rates  and  improved  voice  services’  quality.  In  recent  years,  standards  such  as  Long  Term  Evolution   LTE   advanced  by  the  3G  Partnership  Project  3GPP , and IEEE 802.16e m, also known as Worldwide Interoperability  for Microwave Access  WiMAX , have improved the spectral efficiency of wire- less  channels  thanks  to  the  introduction  of  air  interfaces  based  on  orthogonal  frequency-division  multiplexing   OFDM .  LTE  has  been  regarded  as  the  most  important candidate  to become the  leading technology  in fourth  generation  4G   networks  and  beyond  due  to  its  popularity  and  continuous  development  of  new  features [1].  LTE is a highly flexible radio interface. Its first release defined the fundamen- tal elements of the radio access network  RAN , which is composed of only one  base  station  called  evolved  node  B   eNodeB   providing  user-  and  control-plane  terminations  toward  the  user  equipment   UE   [2].  eNodeBs  are  interconnected  and directly linked to a core network providing connection to other internet pro- tocol  IP  based networks. This so-called flat architecture simplifies the user data  flow and enables flexible, cost-effective capacity scaling [3]. LTE Rel. 8, the first  release of the family of LTE standards, provides peak rates of 300 Mbps, latency  below 10 ms, and a significant boost in spectrum efficiency as compared to pre- vious  cellular  systems.  It  offers  a  scalable  radio  bandwidth,  ranging  from  1.4  to  20 MHz, and supports both frequency-division duplexing  FDD  and time-division  duplexing   TDD   operations.  Other  important  features  relate  to  LTE  cross-layer  mechanisms,  such  as  link  adaptation,  hybrid  automatic  repeat  request   HARQ ,  and multiuser diversity through both time- and frequency-adaptive scheduling. The  designed system also allows up to four spatial layers for single-user multiple input  multiple output  MIMO  transmission [4].  On  top  of  the  basic  framework  put  forth  along  the  lines  above,  3GPP  intro- duced in LTE Rel. 9 features of location-based services, multimedia services both  in broadcast and multicast formats, self-organizing and self-optimizing function- alities,  dual  layer  beamforming,  and  additional  support  to  new  operating  bands.  Notwithstanding  the  importance  of  Releases  8  and  9,  they  are  not  intended  to  meet  the  requirements  issued  by  the  International  Telecommunication  Union  on  International Mobile Telecommunications  4G  systems. In contrast, the advanced  version of LTE was developed bearing those requirements in mind so as to offer  lower latency than the previous releases, peak data rates elevated to up to 3 Gbps  in the downlink, operating bandwidth of up to 100 MHz in the downlink, and effi- cient  interference  management,  just  to  mention  some  among  a  number  of  other  advanced  functionalities.  The  technology  evolution  continues  with  LTE  Rel.  11  and  LTE  Rel.  12,  which  not  only  improve  features  already  introduced  in  previ- ous releases, but also introduce entirely new features. LTE Rel. 13 is still ongoing  standardization work.  In  this  chapter,  we  provide  a  brief  yet  comprehensive  overview  of  current  LTE  systems  and  beyond. The  remainder  of  the  chapter  is  organized  as  follows.  Section 2 presents the baseline LTE technology and the underlying features of its  network  architecture,  protocols,  and  air  interface.  Having  these  basics  in  place,    LTE and Beyond  3  Sect. 3 discusses advanced features that have been introduced and further devel- oped  throughout  subsequent  LTE  releases  aiming  at  improving  spectrum  use,  increase  network  density,  and  delivering  other  performance  improvements.  Two  kinds of advanced services are dealt with in Sect. 4, as these have been receiving  special attention within 3GPP. Section 5 wraps up the chapter with some conclud- ing remarks.  2   Fundamentals of LTE  This section aims at providing a brief yet comprehensive overview about the LTE  technology and its underlying features. The LTE network architecture, protocols,  important  system  features,  and  air  interface  are  described,  putting  in  place  the  basic information on top of which the remainder of this chapter develops.  2.1   Architecture  The  standardization  effort  of  3GPP  has  two  primary  objectives.  The  first  objec- tive was to create a common packet core network, the evolved packet core  EPC ,  to  support  mobile  services,  not  only  over  3GPP-defined  radio  access  technology   RAT , but also over other standardized RATs, e.g., Wi-Fi. The second objective  was to create a new radio access network, called evolved universal terrestrial radio  access  network   E-UTRAN ,  based  on  OFDM.  The  next  subsection  describes  these important network elements.  2.1.1   Core Network  The requirements of the EPC are specified in [5]. As seen in Fig. 1, the EPC con- sists  of  two  control-plane  nodes,  namely  mobility  management  entity   MME   and home subscriber server, and three user-plane nodes, namely serving gateway   S-GW ,  packet-data  network  gateway   P-GW ,  and  policy  and  charging  rules  function  PCRF . Also in Fig. 1, it is easily to figure out protocol stack interfaces  between  every  node  described  in  previous  lines,  for  more  detailed  information  refer to [6].  2.1.2   Access Network  The  access  network  for  normal  user  traffic  does  not  have  a  centralized  control- ler in E-UTRAN, so the architecture is said to be flat [7]. The eNodeB provides  the  radio  interface  and  performs  radio  resource  management   RRM ,  including    4  D. Carrillo et al.  radio bearer control, radio admission control, and scheduling of uplink and down- link radio resources for every UE. The eNodeB also supports IP header compres- sion and encryption of the user plane data. All eNodeBs are interconnected to one  another via an interface X2; which has several uses, e.g., handover.  The other important aspect of LTE is that eNodeBs are connected to the EPC  via  S1  interface,  which  is  split  into  user  and  control  planes.  The  control-plane  interface is referred to as S1-MME and terminates in the MME. The S1-U termi- nates in the S-GW and supports pooling, which is a very important feature estab- lishing a many-to-many relationship between the eNodeBs and the MMEs and the  S-GWs. The S1 interface also supports network sharing. This allows operators to  share the radio network, which are the eNodeBs, while maintaining their own EPC  networks.  The E-UTRAN is responsible for all radio-related functions, which can be sum-  marized as:  	 RRM:  RRM  covers  all  functions  related  to  the  radio  bearers,  such  as  radio  bearer control, radio admission control, radio mobility control, scheduling, and  dynamic allocation of resources to UEs in both uplink and downlink [8];   	 Header  compression:  This  helps  ensure  efficient  use  of  the  radio  interface  by  compressing  IP  packet  headers,  which  could  otherwise  represent  a  significant  overhead—especially in case of small packets, such as voice over IP [9];   	 Security: All data sent over the radio interface is encrypted;  	 Connectivity  to  the  EPC: This  consists  of  the  signaling  toward  the  MME  and   the bearer path toward the S-GW.

Dashed  lines represent the control  plane, whereas solid lines  represent the user plane   LTE and Beyond  5  2.2   Control and User Plane Protocols  Figure 2 shows a general overview of the radio protocol architecture considered in  LTE, as well as the use of radio bearers, logical channels, transport channels, and  physical channels [10]. This figure provides a big picture of both control and data  plane protocols, which are discussed in the sequel.  The  dedicated  radio  resource  control   RRC   messages  that  are  transferred  across  signaling  radio  bearers   SRBs ,  which  are  mapped  via  the  packet-data  convergence  protocol   PDCP   and  radio  link  control   RLC   layers  onto  logical  channels—either  the  common  control  channel   CCCH   during  connection  estab- lishment or a dedicated control channel  DCCH  in RRC_connected state. Paging  messages and system information are mapped directly onto logical channels: the  paging  control  channel   PCCH   and  broadcast  control  channel   BCCH ,  respec- tively. SRB 0 is used for RRC messages which use the CCCH, SRB 1 is for RRC  messages  using  DCCH,  and  SRB  2  is  for  the   lower-priority   RRC  messages  using  DCCH  which  only  include  dedicated  non-access  stratum   NAS   informa- tion. All RRC messages using DCCH are integrity-protected and ciphered by the  PDCP  layer   after  security  activation   and  use ARQ  protocols  for  reliable  deliv- ery through the RLC layer. The RRC messages using CCCH are not integrity pro- tected and do not use ARQ in the RLC layer. It should also be noted that the NAS  independently applies integrity protection and ciphering. The RLC supports data  segmentation and concatenation [11]. Finally, the medium access control  MAC   sublayer [12] provides hybrid ARQ and is responsible for functionalities required  for medium access, e.g., scheduling operation and random access. MAC also per- forms the mapping between logical channels and transport channels.  Fig. 2   Overall radio protocol architecture illustrating radio bearer mapping  adapted from [19]    D. Carrillo et al.  6  2.3   Physical Layer  2.3.1   Frame Structure  Basic  concepts  of  physical  layer  are  described  in  this  subsection.  More  detailed  description can be found in [4, 13].  The transmitted LTE signal is organized in subframes of duration 1 ms, each con- sisting of 12 or 14 OFDM symbols, depending on whether normal or extended CP  is used. Ten subframes form a radio frame as shown in Fig. 3. The short subframe  duration of 1 ms results in small delays, not only for user data, but also for control  signaling  such  as  the  hybrid ARQ  feedback  and  channel-quality  feedback  from  UEs to eNodeBs.  The  main  difference  between  FDD  and TDD  is  that  in  the  latter  special  sub- frames  provide  the  required  guard  time  for  downlink-to-uplink  switching.  Each  special subframe is divided into three fields, namely the downlink part  DwPTS ,  the guard period  GP , and the uplink part  UpPTS  shown in the bottom of Fig. 3.  2.3.2   Downlink Air Interface  In the downlink, the LTE air interface uses orthogonal frequency-division multiple  access  OFDMA  that is a multiple access technique based on OFDM. OFDMA  enables the OFDM transmission to benefit from multiuser diversity, adaptive sub- carrier assignment based on feedback information about frequency-selective chan- nel  conditions,  considerably  enhancing  the  total  system  spectral  efficiency  over  single-user  OFDM  systems.  OFDM  is  a  technique  that  mitigates  inter-symbol  interference,  exploits  the  scarce  frequency  resource  nearly  optimally,  combines  the advantages of broadband and narrowband transmission, while at the same time   Fig. 3   LTE frame structure  adapted from [11]    LTE and Beyond  7  avoids  their  disadvantages.  OFDM  avoids  the  guard  band  between  the  so-called  subcarriers by a modulation of these subcarriers with rectangular pulses.  to   the  sinc x  = sin  x  x   In  the  frequency  domain,  the  spectrum  of  a  pulse  with  duration  Tsym  function  with  zero  crossings  at  corresponds  k Tsym, k = . . . , −2, −1, 1, 2, . . .  Consequently,  if  these  pulses  modulate  sev- eral  subcarriers,  the  inter-subcarrier  interference  is  zero  with  a  subcarrier  spac- ing of 1 Tsym that can be shown to be optimum according to the Nyquist theorem.  Furthermore,  this  optimal  value  is  reached  without  any  filter. The  modulation  of  the  equally  spaced  subcarriers  with  rectangular  pulses  corresponds  to  an  inverse  discrete Fourier transform  DFT  in the time domain. At the receiver, the original  symbols are reconstructed using the opposite function, namely the DFT.  In OFDM systems as LTE, the operation bandwidth can be easily adapted to the  needs of the network operator. LTE FDD, for example, offers bandwidths of 1.4, 3,  5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz. The total bandwidth  includes guard bands at both ends of the spectrum, so that 72, 180, 300, 600, 900,  and 1200 subcarriers are conveyed in the respective bandwidth, as outlined in [14].  To  support  channel  estimation  for  coherent  demodulation,  as  well  as  for  various  measurement  purposes,  including  not  only  measurements  for  mobility  manage- ment but also channel-quality measurements, cell-specific reference signals  CRS   are transmitted in the downlink [15].  LTE uses other air interface technologies like MIMO, which is a technique that  relies on multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver to improve the system  capacity [16]. LTE also uses code rates close to one when channel quality is excel- lent and complements this feature using link adaptation algorithms that allow the  adjustment of channel quality by choosing the best modulation and coding scheme   MCS . Modulation schemes for quadrature phase shift keying  QPSK  and quad- rature amplitude modulation  QAM   16 and 64 points , which can be combined  with multiple code rates, are also provided [17].  2.3.3   Downlink Physical Channels  Physical broadcast channel  PBCH  periodically broadcasts control parameters for  initial cell access, such as downlink system bandwidth, the Physical Hybrid ARQ  Indicator Channel structure, and the most significant 8 bits of the System Frame  Number. These parameters encapsulated in a master information block, which is  14 bits long. PBCH is designed to be detectable without prior knowledge of the  system bandwidth and robust enough to be recoverable at the cell edge. Each sub- frame is self-decodable, aiming at reducing latency and UE battery consumption  in case of good signal quality. PBCH is transmitted using space frequency block  code, a form of transmit diversity used in case of multiple antennas, thus contrib- uting to increase cell coverage.  Physical downlink shared channel  PDSCH  is the main downlink data bearing  channel, which is allocated to users on a dynamic and opportunistic basis. PDSCH  carries data over transport blocks, which correspond to a MAC packet-data unit.    8  D. Carrillo et al.  They are sent from the MAC layer to the PHY layer once per transmission time  interval, which is 1 ms. In order to minimize propagation channel errors, convo- lutional turbo coder is used for forward error correction. Data is mapped to spa- tial  layers  according  to  the  transmission  modes  in  the  multiple  antenna  schemes   e.g., spatial multiplexing, transmit diversity, etc.  and then mapped to a modula- tion symbol which includes QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM. PDSCH also conveys  broadcast information not transmitted on the PBCH, comprising system informa- tion blocks and paging messages.  Physical downlink control channel  PDCCH  purpose is the transmission of the  resource assignment for UEs, which are contained in a downlink control informa- tion  message.  Multiple  PDCCHs  can  be  transmitted  in  the  same  subframe  using  control channel elements, each of which is a set of four resource elements known  as resource element groups. QPSK modulation is used, with four QPSK symbols  per  group.  Furthermore,  up  to  eight  groups  can  be  used  per  UE,  depending  on  channel conditions, in order to increase robustness.  Physical  control  format  indicator  channel   PCFICH   is  used  for  the  control  frame indicator transportation, which includes the number of OFDM symbols used  for control channel transmission in each subframe  typically 1, 2, or 3 . The 32-bit  long CFI is mapped to 16 Resource Elements in the first OFDM symbol of each  downlink frame using QPSK modulation.  Physical hybrid ARQ indicator channel  PHICH  is a control channel defined  for  the  HARQ ACK NAK  signaling  transmission,  which  indicates  success  status  of  uplink  user  data  carried  on  PUSCH.  BPSK  modulation  is  defined  for  PHICH  with a repetition factor of 3 to increase robustness.  2.3.4   Uplink Air Interface  In  its  uplink,  the  LTE  standard  employs  a  DFT-spread  OFDM  also  denoted  as  single-carrier  frequency-division  multiple  access   SC-FDMA .  In  comparison  to  conventional  OFDM,  this  OFDM  variant  provides  an  improved  peak-to-average  power ratio  PAPR  that enables more power-efficient terminals [18]. In addition,  it is possible to aggregate up to two streams by utilizing MIMO transmissions to  increase the data rate.  Both frequency-selective and non-frequency-selective scheduling are supported  in the uplink. In the former, the eNodeB exploits available channel knowledge to  schedule  a  UE  to  transmit  using  specific  physical  resource  blocks   PRBs   in  the  frequency  domain  where  the  channel  response  is  good.  In  addition,  to  transmit  data information, the uplink also conveys control information related to scheduling  request [11], hybrid ARQ acknowledgments in response to downlink data packets,  and channel-quality information for control signaling categorization. The amount  of control information a UE can transmit in a subframe depends on the number of  SC-FDMA symbols available for transmission of control signaling data [19]. More  details about the LTE frame structure are given in the sequel.   LTE and Beyond  2.3.5   Uplink Physical Channels  9  Physical  uplink  shared  channel   PUSCH   carries  user  data,  based  on  QPSK  and  16-QAM  schemes,  with  64-QAM  modulation  being  optional.  Data  bits  are  first  channel-coded  with  a  turbo  code  of  rate  of  1 3,  followed  by  a  rate  match- ing  process  for  a  final  code  rate. Adjacent  data  symbols  are  mapped  to  adjacent  SC-FDMA  symbols  in  the  time  domain,  and  then  across  subcarriers. After  this  interleaving  process,  bits  are  scrambled  and  submitted  to  modulation  mapping,  DFT  spreading,  subcarrier  mapping,  and  OFDM  modulation.  Besides  user  data,  PUSCH conveys control signaling for information recovering in the uplink, such  as transport format indicators and MIMO parameters. Control data is multiplexed  with information data prior to DFT spreading.  Physical  uplink  control  channel   PUCCH   is  used  for  uplink  transmission  of  control  information,  comprising  Hybrid ARQ  acknowledgments,  channel-quality  indicators, MIMO feedback  rank indicator and precoding matrix indicator , and  scheduling  requests. This  channel  transmits  in  a  frequency  region  at  the  edge  of  the system bandwidth. It consists of one PRB per transmission, positioned at one  channel edge, and another PRB at the opposite channel edge in the following slot,  thus making use of frequency diversity.  Physical random access channel  PRACH  is an uplink channel primarily used  for initial network access and short message transmission [20]. The main purpose  of the random access procedure is to enable UEs to acquire uplink time synchroni- zation and to access to the network. PRACH comprises a preamble composed of a  cyclic prefix  CP , of length TCP, and a sequence part, of length TPRE, as shown in  Fig. 4.  Prime-length Zadoff–Chu sequences are adopted as random access preambles in  LTE systems due to its constant amplitude zero autocorrelation properties [21–23],  meaning that all points of the sequence lie on the unit circle and its autocorrela- tion is zero for all time shifts other than zero. These properties make Zadoff–Chu  sequences very useful in channel estimation and time synchronization, and enable  improved PRACH preamble detection performance [21].  It is worth mentioning that PRACH plays a key role in the cell coverage perfor- mance, since eNodeB must run detection algorithms in order to recover preambles  transmitted by UEs, which requires complex statistical real-time processing in the  uplink [22].

Carrillo et al.  2.4   Other Important Features of LTE  Radio link conditions change in wireless system and there is a necessity to adapt  the transmission and reception parameters to the actual link conditions. Therefore,  a brief description of link adaptation and handover is presented in next lines.  2.4.1   Link Adaptation  LTE uses code rates close to 1 when the channel quality is excellent and complement  this feature using link adaptation algorithms to allow the adjustment of channel quality  by choosing the best MCS. LTE provides modulation schemes for QPSK, 16-QAM,  and 64-QAM which can be combined with any code rate [17]. As an example, a map- ping curve between signal-to-noise ratio  SNR  and MCS is shown in Fig. 5.  2.4.2   Handover  The handover procedure aims at maintaining UEs connections during the migra- tion among neighboring cells. The goal is to minimize the impacts on the services   Fig. 5   Modulation and coding scheme  MCS  versus signal-to-noise ratio  SNR    LTE and Beyond  11  continuity, and a variety of mechanisms are defined by 3GPP in order to achieve it.  The basic handover procedure mandated by 3GPP for LTE Rel. 8 [24] is illustrated  in Fig. 6.  The  handover  procedure  is  based  on  a  sequence  of  key  events,  detailed  in  Fig. 7, and starts with the measurement report of a handover event by the UE to its  serving eNodeB. The UE periodically performs downlink radio channel measure- ments based on reference symbols, comprising received power and quality. Once  a pre-configured threshold level is met, the UE sends the corresponding measure- ment  report  indicating  the  triggered  event.  In  addition,  the  measurement  report  indicates the cell to which the UE has to be handed over, which is named “target”  cell.  Based on the received measurement reports, the serving eNodeB starts hando- ver  process,  with  control  signaling  exchange  with  target  eNodeB  and  admission  control  of  the  new  UE.  The  communication  between  the  serving  and  the  tar- get  eNodeBs  is  performed  over  X2  interface.  Upon  successful  handover  setup,  the  decision  is  made  and  a  handover  command  is  sent  to  the  UE.  The  connec- tion  between  UE  and  the  serving  cell  is  released  and  then  the  UE  attempts  to   Fig. 6   Basic handover procedure used in LTE   12  Fig. 7   Handover triggering  events  D. Carrillo et al.  synchronize and access the target eNodeB, by using the PRACH. Upon successful  synchronization at the target eNodeB, this last one transmits an uplink scheduling  grant to the UE. The UE responds with a handover confirm message, which noti- fies the completion of the handover procedure at the radio access network part.  3   Advanced Features  Having the basic LTE infrastructure and features discussed in Sect. 2, this section  now  describes  what  we  shall  refer  to  as  advanced  features.  Such  functionalities  have been introduced and further developed throughout subsequent LTE releases  bearing in mind three goals that are regarded as main requirements for next-gener- ation mobile networks: better spectrum usage  whether by exploiting new bands or  improving  spectral  efficiency ,  network  densification,  and  performance  improve- ments.  This  latter  requirement  will  focus  solely  on  features  related  to  interfer- ence management, as other improvements, such as air interface modifications for  latency reduction in the physical layer and coordinated multipoint, are out of the  scope of this chapter.  3.1   Spectrum Usage, Spectrum Efficiency and Capacity  3.1.1   LTE Wi-Fi Interworking  Mobile  operators  are  known  to  prioritize  the  delivery  of  advanced  services  and  user experience over licensed frequency bands, and this will remain so according    LTE and Beyond  Fig. 8   A typical scenario  of licensed-assisted access  operating in licensed and  unlicensed bands  13  to  a  recent  assessment  from  3GPP  [9].  Notwithstanding  the  unquestionable  role  played  by  the  licensed  spectrum  in  the  quest  for  more  bandwidth,  opportunistic  use of unlicensed spectrum has been receiving increased attention as complemen- tary  means  to  meet  the  ever-growing  traffic  demands.  One  way  to  benefit  from  unlicensed  spectrum  is  through  LTE Wi-Fi  Interworking,  a  framework  for  traffic  offload that is under development since LTE Rel. 8. Interworking forms are getting  tighter and tighter throughout subsequent LTE releases, and proposals for Rel. 13  include LTE Wi-Fi aggregation, mobility control based on UE measurements and  network steering capabilities, and an interface to interconnect eNodeBs with Wi-Fi  access points [25].  Licensed-assisted access  LAA , sometimes referred to as LTE Unlicensed, is  a  term  used  within  3GPP  to  denote  a  study  item  aimed  to  look  into  alternative  interworking ways for enhancing the operation of LTE in unlicensed bands. The  underlying idea of LAA consists of aggregating a primary cell  PCell  with a sec- ondary cell  SCell , respectively, operating in licensed and unlicensed spectra, as  it is shown in Fig. 8. The goal of the PCell is to deliver critical information and  ascertain the quality of service, whereas that of the SCell is to boost data rates in  an opportunistic fashion. The SCell can be set up as downlink-only or both uplink  and downlink, although a common view at 3GPP is that the study will begin with  the first option and follow with the second one in the future [9]. The core technol- ogy under development for LAA targets to be as much frequency agnostic as pos- sible, so initial emphasis will be on unlicensed operation in the 5 GHz bands with  other frequencies addressed at later stage.  LAA raises some specific issues that will need to be dealt with, namely effec- tive and “fair”1 coexistence with Wi-Fi and effective and fair coexistence among   1By  “fair”  it  is  meant  that  LAA  should  not  impact Wi-Fi  services   data,  video,  and  voice  ser- vices  more than an additional Wi-Fi network operating on the same carrier would. These metrics  could include throughput, latency, and jitter, but will be exactly defined in the coexistence study.   14  D. Carrillo et al.  LAA  networks  operated  by  different  operators.  The  use  of  coexistence  mecha- nisms has been deemed required for this to work, including clear channel assess- ment,  discontinuous  transmission  on  carrier  with  limited  maximum  transmission  duration,  dynamic  frequency  selection  in  certain  bands regions,  carrier  selection,  and transmit power control [25]. Preliminary simulation results suggest that LTE  augmented with appropriate coexistence mechanisms for unlicensed spectrum can  effectively  coexist  with  Wi-Fi,  and  is  able  to  outperform  it  in  terms  of  spectral  efficiency.  3.1.2   Carrier Aggregation  Perhaps  the  most  straightforward  way  to  increase  capacity  is  by  making  more  bandwidth  available  to  a  communications  system.  Since  LTE  Rel.  10,  this  is  done  by  simply  aggregating  more  bandwidth  through  carrier  aggregation   CA .  Backward  compatibility  is  a  mandatory  characteristic  of  the  CA  technology.  Therefore,  during  the  standardization  of  LTE-Advanced  features,  3GPP  deter- mined  that  CA  would  have  to  keep  backward  compatibility  with  UEs  based  on  Releases 8 and 9. So the larger bandwidths introduced with LTE Rel. 10 are pro- vided through aggregation of standard LTE Rel. 8 and 9 carriers. Other important  characteristic  of  CA,  which  renders  it  one  of  the  most  remarkable  contributions  of  Rel.  10,  is  that  it  can  be  used  for  both  FDD  and  TDD  deployments  of  LTE- Advanced systems [26].  CA works with contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum. Each aggregated car- rier denotes a component carrier  CC . Each CC can have one of the standardized  bandwidths: 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, or 20 MHz. A maximum of up to five CCs can be  aggregated; hence, the maximum aggregated bandwidth is 100 MHz. As illustrated  in Fig. 9, the individual bandwidth of each CC adding up to the aggregated system  bandwidth can be different. The number of aggregated carriers can be different in  the  downlink  and  uplink  for  FDD  systems.  However,  the  number  of  uplink  CCs  must always be lower than or equal to the number of downlink CCs. On the other   Fig. 9   Exemplary realization of CA where three CCs with individual bandwidths of 20, 10, and  10 MHz are aggregated to yield a wider 40 MHz system bandwidth   LTE and Beyond  15  hand, for TDD systems, both the number of CCs and their individual bandwidths  will be equal for both downlink and uplink [27].  Ongoing work within the scope of LTE Rel. 13 seeks to address the operators’  need  to  expand  the  CA  framework  so  that  it  is  able  to  aggregate  more  than  five  CCs. The goal is to further boost achievable data rates by aggregating more than  five CCs  at least in the downlink . Flexibility will also undergo a major improve- ment, as the resulting system will be capable of aggregating larger numbers of car- riers in different frequency bands. Such enhanced CA framework is also of utmost  importance in LAA, explained earlier in this section. However, not all the aspects  of CA scale directly with an increased CC number and a number of issues arise  when more than three CCs are used [28]:  	 PUCCH  transmission  currently  is  applied  only  in  the  PCell,  so  increasing  the  number of CCs will increase the PUCCH payload size per CA UE. Besides the  impact on the PCell uplink, which gets worse as the number of CA UEs grows,  having  all  PUCCH  transmissions  managed  by  the  PCell  is  believed  to  impact  performance. PCell overload can be alleviated by distributing the UEs PUCCH  resources in the network, although this comes at the expense of more involved  installation,  i.e.,  simple  small  cell  installation  with  remote  radio  heads  is  no  longer possible;   	 The  dual  connectivity  concept  developed  within  the  scope  of  LTE  Rel.  12  requires  UEs  capable  of  uplink  CA  with  simultaneous  PUCCH PUCCH  and  PUCCH PUSCH transmissions across cell groups. The introduction of PUCCH  in  the  SCell,  known  as  Dual  PUCCH,  is  seen  as  essential  as  it  can  ease  the  aforementioned  burdens  thus  allowing  for  an  increased  number  of  aggregated  carriers in the downlink. This idea, however, was dropped from the correspond- ing work item objective due to the tight schedule of LTE Rel-12;   	 Finally,  and  independent  of  Dual  PUCCH  mechanisms,  CA  extension  to  sup- port  up  to  32  CCs  requires  enhancements  also  when  it  comes  to  hybrid ARQ  acknowledgment  feedback  and  channel  state  information  feedback  carried  on  a  single  uplink  carrier.  This  has  potential  to  improve  CA  in  the  case  of  TDD  PCells, which faces limitations on PDSCH hybrid ARQ acknowledgment feed- back already with three CCs.  3.1.3   Advanced MIMO Techniques  The  last  relevant  features  of  LTE  Rel.  13  discussed  in  this  chapter  are  elevation  beamforming  and  full-dimension  MIMO.  In  this  context,  3GPP  seeks  a  bet- ter  understanding  on  how  two-dimensional  antenna  arrays  can  further  improve  the spectral efficiency of LTE by exploiting the vertical dimension in addition to  the  azimuth  dimension   the  latter  has  been  exploited  in  isolation  since  LTE  Rel.  10  for beamforming and MIMO operations. A number of strategies are enabled  if  additional  control  over  the  elevation  dimension  is  available,  e.g.,  vertical  pat- tern beamwidth and or downtilt can be controlled in an adaptive fashion, vertical    16  D. Carrillo et al.  domain  sectorization,  and  user-specific  elevation  beamforming.  Besides  being  a  standard-transparent  technology,  this  can  improve  the  average  system  perfor- mance. Elevation beamforming, in contrast, is a UE-specific technique with poten- tial to increase the signal to interference and noise ratio statistics seen by the UEs.  This  is  possible  by  pointing  the  vertical  antenna  pattern  in  the  direction  of  the  intended UE, thus generating less interference to other non-intended UEs operat- ing in adjacent sectors.  The  study  [28],  which  is  split  into  two  phases,  aims  to  determine  the  perfor- mance  benefit  of  enhancements  targeting  the  operation  of  two-dimensional  antenna arrays  including a single column of cross-poles  with eight or more trans- ceiver units, each having its own, independent amplitude and phase control. Phase  1 will take into account the three-dimensional channel model proposed in [29] to  identify antenna settings for two-dimensional arrays with up to 64 antenna ports  at the eNodeB, and to evaluate the performance of LTE Rel. 12 downlink MIMO  for both single- and multiuser cases. Phase 2 comprises the evaluation of poten- tial enhancements in reference signal design, codebook, and feedback mechanisms  for single-user and multiuser MIMO transmission schemes  including support for  higher dimension multiuser MIMO settings , channel reciprocity based operation,  diversity transmission schemes, methods for common channel coverage, cell point  selection, and or RRM measurement reliability.  3.2   Network Densification  3GPP began work toward the standardization of self-optimizing and self-organiz- ing capabilities in LTE Releases 8 and 9. These standards provide network intel- ligence and management features that automate the configuration and optimization  of wireless networks as a response to variations in the actual radio channel condi- tions. A key goal of 3GPP has been the ability to support self-organizing networks   SON   features  in  multivendor  environments,  so  a  significant  part  of  this  stand- ardization  work  has  been  devoted  to  defining  the  appropriate  interfaces  to  allow  exchange  of  common  information  that  can  then  be  used  by  different  SON  algo- rithms [30]. SON specifications have been built over the existing 3GPP network  management architecture.  In  LTE  Rel.  8,  the  functionality  focuses  on  procedures  associated  with  initial  equipment  installation  and  integration  to  support  the  commercial  deployment  of  the first LTE networks, also known as “eNodeB self-configuration”. Such proce- dures include:  	 Automatic inventory;  	 Automatic software download [31];  	 Automatic neighbor relation [32];  	 Automatic physical cell ID assignment [33].   LTE and Beyond  17  In LTE Rel. 9, the SON functionality focuses on operational aspects of commercial  networks, particularly on key aspects related to network optimization procedures.  The standardization scope includes the following additional use cases [30, 34]:  	 Mobility robustness handover optimization  MRO : in particular, the handover  parameter optimization function shall aim at reducing the number of handover- related  failures  that  cause  degradation  in  user  experience,  such  as  call  drops,  radio link failures during or shortly after handovers, and reduced data rates;   	 Random  access  channel   RACH   optimization:  an  automatic  RACH  optimiza- tion function monitors the prevailing conditions, e.g., a change on RACH load,  uplink interference, and determines and updates the appropriate parameters;   	 Load balancing optimization: each scenario shall include the load balancing on   intra-frequency, inter-frequency, and inter-RAT;   	 Inter-cell interference coordination  ICIC : the following scenarios shall be con-  sidered in interference control: uplink ICIC, and downlink ICIC;   	 Capacity  and  coverage  optimization,  in  this  use  case  operator  shall  be  able  to  configure the objectives and targets for the coverage and capacity optimization  function.  Other  SON-related  aspects  discussed  within  the  scope  of  LTE  Rel.  9  framework  include improvement of the telecom management system so as to increase energy  savings,  new  operations,  administration,  and  maintenance  interface  to  control  home eNodeBs, UE reporting functionality to minimize the amount of drive tests,  studies on self-testing and self- healing functions, and minimization of drive test- ing. As will be seen later on in this chapter, SON-related functions continued to  expand through the subsequent releases of the LTE standard [35].  In  order  to  maintain  network  quality  with  minimum  manual  intervention  on  the part of the operator, the concept of SON has been advanced within the scope  of the LTE standard since its introduction in Rel. 8. The need for enhanced SON  procedures was one of the goals of LTE Rel. 11, as 3GPP identified that previous  releases had issues with respect to mobility and inter-RAT operation. The resulting  procedures for enhanced SON are found in [36] and encompass:  	 MRO test cases were completed in LTE Rel. 10, so that networks based on that  release are capable of detecting related issues whenever the UE reconnects to an  LTE cell. The event whereby a cell at a different RAT may mistakenly be selected  after connection failure was not addressed  no mechanism is currently available  to detect nor to correct it . Inter-RAT failure issues related to the deployment of  LTE  over  2G 3G  coverage  and  connection  failure  resolution  support  for  some  heterogeneous networks  HetNets  deployments were dealt with in LTE Rel. 11;   	 Some problems related to mobility were identified since LTE Rel. 9 and have  been  addressed  in  LTE  Rel.  11.  Inter-RAT  “ping-pongs”,  for  instance,  are  known  not  to  result  in  a  failure  but  are  rather  inefficient  in  that  they  create  unnecessary  signaling.  Therefore,  it  was  found  relevant  to  exploit  UE  history  data to enhance the existing LTE Rel. 8 mechanism.   18  D. Carrillo et al.  3.3   Interference Management  3.3.1   Inter-Cell Interference Coordination  One  limiting  aspect  of  system  throughput  performance  in  cellular  networks  is  inter-cell interference, especially in the case of cell-edge users. A simple method  to improve cell-edge data rates is to statically restrict the use of certain parts of the  operation bandwidth. Such static schemes fall into one of three broad categories:  traditional   hard   fractional  frequency  reuse  [37],  soft  frequency  reuse  [38],  and  partial frequency reuse [39]. 3GPP addressed this issue through an eNodeB sched- uling  strategy  that  includes  an  ICIC  element. This  early  ICIC  mitigates  interfer- ence on traffic channels only, and operates in both power and frequency domains  to  mitigate  cell-edge  interference  coming  from  neighboring  cells.  Time-domain  interference  coordination  is  not  used,  as  it  would  interfere  with  the  operation  of  hybrid ARQ processes  especially in the uplink where synchronous hybrid ARQ is  used  [40]. In LTE Rel. 8, ICIC is inherently a multicell RRM function that needs  to take into account information from multiple cells, e.g., the resource usage sta- tus and traffic load situation. The preferred ICIC method may be different in the  uplink and downlink [41].  The coordination between LTE cell sites is achieved by exchanging messages  between eNodeBs over the X2 interface as shown in Fig. 10. Frequency-domain   Fig. 10   Pictorial description of the ICIC strategy mandated within the LTE Rel. 8 standard   LTE and Beyond  19  ICIC  in  the  downlink  basically  controls  the  cell  power  for  resources  by  sending  a  relative  narrowband  transmit  power  message  as  often  as  every  200  ms.  Such  messages  contain  information  about  whether  a  given  PRB  is  limited  by  transmit  power. When a neighboring eNodeB listens to this message, it can avoid schedul- ing on the indicated PRB. Two messages are defined for uplink interference coor- dination,  namely  high  interference  indicator   HII   and  overload  indication,  and  exchanged between eNodeBs as often as every 20 ms. HII is used to communicate  on  which  PRB  the  eNodeB  is  going  to  schedule  cell-edge  users.  By  listening  to  this message, a neighboring eNodeB can avoid scheduling cell-edge users in that  same indicated PRB. This results in reduced uplink interference for both cells. The  action  taken  by  an  eNodeB  when  it  receives  an  HII  message  is  implementation  specific. An eNodeB sends an overload indication to indicate the level of interfer- ence  low, mid, or high  experienced in different PRBs to neighboring eNodeBs.  Upon receiving such a message, an eNodeB can change its scheduling pattern to  free  the  PRBs  indicated  in  that  message,  thus  reducing  the  interference  for  cell- edge users.  We  have  seen  that  basic  ICIC  technology  has  been  in  use  since  LTE  Rel.  8.  However, in the case of HetNets, where macro cells are complemented with small  cells, i.e., femtocells, picocells, and microcells, the interference imposed by small  cells on the macro cell and vice versa still lacked a proper strategy. This issue was  properly  dealt  with  in  LTE  Rel.  10  with  the  introduction  of  an  enhanced  ICIC   eICIC  feature, designed bearing the aforementioned interference issues common  in HetNets.  eICIC relies on power, frequency, and time domain strategies to mitigate intra- frequency  interference.  Power  and  frequency  strategies  in  LTE  Rel.  10  are  the  same for LTE Rel. 8. The strategy used to reduce interference in the time domain  is that a serving cell stops transmitting or transmits with very low power at a cer- tain subframe, so that an interfering cell can transmit its signal during that period.  The subframe with very low signal power is termed almost blank subframe  ABS .  ABSs do not comprise any traffic channels and are mostly control channel frames  with  very  low  power.  If  a  macro  cell  configures ABSs,  UEs  connected  to  small  cells  should  then  send  their  data  during  such  subframes,  avoiding  interference  from  the  macro  cell.  Therefore,  and  in  contrast  to  the  baseline  ICIC,  eICIC  not  only mitigates interference on traffic channels but also on control channels [42].  eICIC  strategies  proposed  in  LTE  Rel.  10  are,  however,  not  able  to  address  interference caused by CRS transmitted to support legacy deployments, i.e., LTE  networks based on Releases 8 and 9. CRS and other mandatory system informa- tion  are  the  only  signals  transmitted  during ABS,  and  it  is  employed  for  mobil- ity  measurements  and  demodulation  of  the  downlink  control  and  data  channels.  Therefore,  interference  caused  by  neighboring  cells  could  be  detrimental  for  the  measurement  of  channel  quality  and  demodulation  of  various  data  and  control  channels [43].  In this context, the main enhancement introduced in LTE Rel. 11 is the provi- sion of CRS assistance information of aggressor cells to the UEs. CRS assistance  information is provided by the eNodeB to cancel unwanted CRS, thus mitigating    20  D. Carrillo et al.  further interference. This information helps UEs improve both CRS-based meas- urements  and  demodulation  of  data control  channels  by  indicating  them  the  neighbor  cells  that  have ABS  configured. This  improvement  is  known  as  further  enhanced ICIC  feICIC . Not only is this technology able to tackle the interference  scenarios  described  from  Releases  8  through  10  but  it  also  manages  CRS-based  interference through coordinated transmitter and receiver actions [44].  As with eICIC, feICIC was also conceived to deal with interference issues in  HetNets. The idea is to add a layer of complexity to the receivers, which now must  also handle inter-cell interference cancellation. One important benefit introduced  thereby  is  that  the  mitigation  of  neighbor  CRS  interference  enables  further  cell  range extension and ensures that weak cells can be detected [45].  3.3.2   Interference Rejection Combining  The  LTE  technology  provides  high  spectral  efficiency  within  one  cell,  but  it  can  be  shown  to  be  highly  vulnerable  to  inter-cell  interference.  Interference  rejection  combining   IRC   is  a  technology  introduced  in  LTE  Rel.  11,  which  is  implemented  in  the  layer  1  of  LTE  systems,  and  can  be  described  as  an  effi- cient  alternative  to  increase  uplink  bit  rates  in  areas  where  cells  overlap  [46].  Interference  caused  by  adjacent  cells  restricts  throughput  in  environments  where  the power of the interference signal is stronger than that of the noise.  The use of IRC receiver technology at the UE was advanced as means to reject  and  suppress  interference,  thus  mitigating  the  effects  of  unwanted  signals  and  increasing user throughput [47]. The main idea behind IRC is the regeneration of  the  transmitted  signal  based  on  the  estimation  of  data  from  previous  receptions,  emulation of the distortion introduced by the multipath channels and, finally, the  subtraction of all regenerated interfering signals from the uplink received signals  in order to obtain a more reliable estimation of the original users’ data.  This feature uses the spatial separation and characteristics of inter-cell interfer- ence to determine the power of the interfering UE which belongs to another cell.  Once the pattern and power level is determined, the victim cell can then remove  the interferer from the received signals [48].  4   Advanced Services  This  section  deals  with  two  services  that  have  been  receiving  special  attention  within  3GPP,  namely  multimedia  broadcasting  services  and  machine-centered  communication services. The former provides operators with an economical solu- tion  for  multiuser,  high-bandwidth  services,  while  the  latter  seeks  to  leverage  the LTE technology as competitive option for the multibillion Internet of Things  market.   LTE and Beyond  21  4.1   Multimedia Broadcasting and Multicasting  The term multimedia broadcast and multicast service  MBMS  is not fundamen- tally new to 3GPP, and so not defined as an LTE-only feature. In fact, this feature  was first specified in 3GPP Rel. 6 with the goal of making it possible for network  operators to broadcast over their cellular networks. MBMS provides native support  for broad- and multi-casting IP packets in wireless networks, thus allowing high  bandwidth services to be offered to multiple users in an economical manner, e.g.,  on-demand  video,  mobile  TV,  short  news  clips,  weather  reports,  match  results,  and  software  updates  [49]. The  evolved  MBMS   eMBMS   framework  has  as  its  key motivation the integration of broadcast and multicast extensions into mobile  communication  systems,  thus  enabling  efficient  group-related  data  distribution  services—especially over the radio interface. As defined in LTE Releases 8 and 9  [50, 51], eMBMS baseline definition supports adaptive hypertext transfer protocol  streaming  via  broadcast,  and  a  few  bugs  have  been  identified  and  fixed  through  real implementation.  eMBMS  is  a  unidirectional  service,  which  targets  the  delivery  of  multime- dia data from a single source entity to multiple recipients, optimizing the use of  scarce resources. The main requirements during provisioning of eMBMS services  are ensuring efficient overall usage of radio and network resources and reducing  the  power  requirements  for  the  provisioning  of  such  demanding  services  [52].  Multimedia broadcast single frequency network  MBSFN  operation is a key new  feature  of  LTE  that  brings  about  the  possibility  of  exploiting  the  OFDM  radio  interface  to  transmit  broadcast  or  multicast  data  as  a  multicell  transmission  over  a  synchronized  SFN. A  pictorial  description  of  the  eMBMS  service  deployed  in  MBSFN operation is given in Fig. 11.  MBSFN transmission enables a more efficient operation of the MBMS service,  allowing  over-the-air  combination  of  multicell  transmissions  toward  the  UEs.  In   Fig. 11   Pictorial description of the eMBMS service in MBSFN operation   22  D. Carrillo et al.  an MBSFN operation, MBMS data is transmitted simultaneously over the air from  multiple  tightly  time-synchronized  cells.  A  UE  receiver  will  therefore  observe  multiple versions of the signal with different delays due to the multicell transmis- sion. There will be no inter-symbol interference, provided that transmissions from  multiple  cells  are  sufficiently  synchronized  for  each  to  arrive  at  the  UE  within  the CP at the start of the symbol. In effect, this makes the MBSFN transmission  appear to a UE as a transmission from a single large cell, so the UE receiver can  treat multicell transmissions in the same way as multipath components of a single- cell transmission without incurring any additional complexity [53–56].  4.2   Machine-Type Communications  Machine-type communications  MTC  have been regarded as such a revenue gen- eration  opportunity  that  mobile  operators  would  not  want  to  let  it  slide.  From  the  operator perspective, it is clearly more efficient if future MTC devices can be served  using  already  deployed  RATs.  One  crucial  question  that  remains  open  thus  far  is  whether LTE technology can be competitive enough when it comes to efficient MTC  support.  MTC  devices,  often  referred  to  as  MTC  UEs  in  the  context  of  LTE,  will  likely be deployed in large numbers, so individual device cost plays a role of utmost  importance  for  leveraging  future  LTE-based  MTC  networks.  In  such  networks,  communication will take place in the form of infrequent, short burst transmissions,  which in turn call for low operational power consumption on the part of MTC UEs.  Aware of this promising Internet of Things market, 3GPP plans to enhance LTE  suitability  for  MTC-specific  applications.  Standardization  efforts  began  in  Rel.  12  [57]  and  are  expected  to  continue  in  Rel.  13  [58]. The  goal  is  to  introduce  a  new, low-complex UE category able to operate with bandwidth and transmit power  requirements both reduced for ultra-long battery life. Operation channels 1.4 MHz  wide are envisioned, so operators can multiplex reduced bandwidth MTC UEs and  regular UEs in their existing LTE deployments. To cater to operation in the pres- ence of poor propagation conditions, e.g., in case of geotechnical sensors deployed  under  the  ground  level,  delay-tolerant  MTC  UEs  will  have  a  coverage  improve- ment of the order of 15–20 dB.  Assuming multislot class 2 terminals based on enhanced general packet radio  service as benchmark for cost comparison and minimum data rate capability, the  3GPP  study  has  put  together  a  list  of  features  and  their  modifications  to  reduce  cost  and  improve  coverage  along  with  various  hardware  simplifications.  It  turns  out that the three actions yielding the largest UE cost reduction gains are [57]:  	 Reduced bandwidth for both RF and baseband for downlink and uplink: Gain of   39 % at the expense of 1–3 dB degradation to cell coverage;   	 Single receive RF: Gains of up to 29 % at the cost of 4 dB degradation to cell   coverage;   	 Peak rate reduction: Gains of up to 21 % without any degradation to cell coverage.   LTE and Beyond  23  When  jointly  implemented,  the  actions  above  can  cut  off  UE  costs  in  as  much  as 59 %. The resulting degradation to cell coverage was found to lie in the range  5–9 dB in this case. Other actions assessed in the study include half-duplex FDD,  uplink transmit power reduction, and transmission mode reduction.  5   Concluding Remarks  This  brief  chapter  has  presented  a  comprehensive  overview  of  current  LTE  sys- tems and beyond. We have presented the baseline technology and the underlying  features of network architecture, protocols, and air interface introduced in the first  LTE release back in 2008. Having the basics put in place, we moved forward to  discuss advanced features introduced and further developed throughout subsequent  LTE releases. The discussion found in the present chapter takes into consideration  even the still under discussion LTE Release 13, which has in March 2016 its esti- mated freeze date.  References    1.

This  chapter  highlights  the  impacts  of  these  regulatory  sectors  on  systemic  requirements,  and  points  out  new  opportunities  for  developing  broadband  radio  access system technologies taking the Brazilian regulatory scenario as a reference.  1   Introduction  The access to voice and data services over a broadband access network is first and  foremost  a  public  interest  service  granted  under  a  public  regime,  or  authorized  under a private regime. However, it can also be characterized as the rendering of  restricted interest services under a private regime when specific frequency bands  are  allocated  to  the  different  Limited  Private  Service   SLP .  The  SLP  regime  is  intended  to  support  the  operational  activities  of  companies,  such  as  the  electric   C. Lorena Neto  *  · E.J. Bonon · F.L.

In  this  chapter,  the  Brazilian  Regulatory  Framework  for  telecommunications  services is adopted as basis for an analysis, as an effort to assess its impacts and  highlight  new  opportunities  for  developing  Fourth  Generation   4G   and  beyond  broadband radio access system technologies. In order to provide a full understand- ing of the current scenario, some basic concepts and the evolution of the Brazilian  regulatory framework are briefly described within each section.  International  demand  for  a  global  and  uniform  distribution  of  frequency  bands for fixed and mobile radio access systems has driven International Mobile  Telecommunications  IMT  standardization activities since the 1980s. This broad  concept,  supported  by  technical  recommendations  and  requirements,  globally  defines  systemic  interoperability  issues   for  both  network  and  aerial  interfaces ,  and services supported by certified technologies.  Within  the  IMT  scope,  and  consequently  based  on  a  standards  set  from  the  National  Agency  for  Telecommunications   Brazilian  counterpart  of  the  FCC,  hereafter referred to simply as ANATEL  for the Brazilian territory, services sup- ported  by  broadband  radio  access  system  have  been  defined.  These  comprise  Public  Switched  Telephone  Networks   PSTN ,  Personal  Mobile  Service   SMP ,  Multimedia  Communication  Services   SCM ,  for  general   collective   interest  applications, and SLP, with its different sub-modalities, for private applications.  Furthermore,  several  frequency  bands  have  been  defined,  regulated,  and  allo- cated  to  the  main  collective  interest  services   fixed PSTN  and  mobile SMP   in  the  824  MHz–2.2  GHz  portion  of  the  spectrum.  The  majority  of  this  spectrum  has been licensed to SMP service providers and is mainly used for voice services.  This segment of the spectrum, although relevant for the sector, is out of the scope  of this chapter, as it has already been thoroughly consolidated worldwide, and as  such has no significant impact on emerging technologies under development.  The  allocation  of  new  frequency  bands,  for  both  public  and  private  ser- vices,  is  a  topic  under  constant  discussion  by  ANATEL  and  the  Ministry  of  Communications.  Such  frequency  bands  have  a  high  potential  for  application  in  4G and beyond broadband radio access technology, and are located for the most  part in Ultra High Frequency  UHF  bands below 1 GHz, in some segments, in the  1.5 GHz range, and in certain specific bands such as 2.6 and 3.5 GHz. Therefore,  special attention must be given to the evolution expected for these new frequency  bands, especially regarding the technical requirements of services that occupy that  same  frequency  band,  sub-bands,  or  neighboring  sub-bands.  These  issues  pose  a direct impact on the requirements for the coexistence of systems and services,  and,  consequently,  on  the  requirements  of  new  technologies  and  products  under  development.  Laboratory  tests  for ANATEL  certification  and  approval  of  products  are  sup- ported by a mixed structure of standards, resolutions, and technical requirements,  which have been constantly modified to ensure they are adequate for new technol- ogies and frequency bands. These regulatory standards must be analyzed in terms    Brazilian Telecommunications Regulatory …  29  of  electromagnetic  compatibility  and  electrical  protection,  and  more  specifically,  in terms of requirements for base transceiver stations, terminals, and antennas.  The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 an overview of  the Brazilian Regulatory Framework is presented. In Sect. 3 the use of the radio  frequency spectrum and band allocation issues are addressed, while in Sect. 4— products, and in Sect. 5—antennas the matter of product certification is addressed.  2   Regulatory Framework of Telecommunication Services  Telecommunication  services  are  classified  as  collective  interest  services  or  restricted interest services.  2.1   Collective Interest Services  Collective  interest  services  are  those  that  are  rendered  under  a  public  or  private  regime, and seek to meet collective needs indiscriminately. The only public service  rendered under a federal concession is PSTN. SMP and SCM are authorized pri- vate services.  2.1.1   Public Switched Telephone Network  PSTN  was  first  regulated  under  the  name  Public  Phone  Service   STP ,  by  the  Ministry of Communications Standard  05 [1]. In 1998, Resolution  73 [2] was  issued, containing the basic regulations for telecommunication services. A month  later,  Resolution    85  [3]  was  published  with  the  first  PSTN  regulatory  stand- ards,  under  ANATEL’s  regulatory  administration.  The  main  difference  in  scope  between  Standard  05 79  and  Resolution  85  is  in  the  way  services  are  provided.  The first one regulated telecom services under the state-controlled regime, stipulat- ing that “public phone services are provided nationwide by companies controlled  by  Telecomunicações  Brasileiras  S A   TELEBRÁS   and  by  other  companies  and organizations with concession contracts in effect”. The second one regulated  PSTN,  specified  that  services  were  to  be  provided  under  “contracts  or  terms  of  concession,  permission  and  authorization,  signed  between  Service  Providers  and  ANATEL”.  Still  in  1998, ANATEL  published  Resolution    78  [4],  laying  out  guidelines  for  allocating  frequency  bands  for  Fixed  Wireless  Access  Systems  to  provide  PSTN  services,  a  system  known  at  the  time  as Wireless  Local  Loop   WLL .  In  1999, Resolution  146 [5] approved regulatory standards for WLL certification,  while  Resolution    166  [6],  also  issued  in  1999,  regulated WLL  system  utiliza- tion. These were mainly supported by Cellular Mobile Service  SMC  networks,    30  currently SMP. In 2005, ANATEL published new regulatory standards for PSTN  in Resolution  426 [7]. This resolution increased the scope of PSTN service defi- nitions,  especially  regarding  accessibility,  personal  services,  Significant  Market  Power,  the  ability  to  identify  the  origins  and  destinations  of  calls,  the  protec- tion  or  suspension  of  privacy,  the  sharing  of  infrastructure,  among  other  issues.  Resolution  426, issued in 2005, regulates PSTN until today.  2.1.2   Personal Mobile Services  In 1996, Law 9,295 [8], also known as Minimum Law, was passed, defining tel- ecommunication  services  and  their  organization,  as  well  as  outlining  the  powers  of  the  regulatory  body.  This  law  was  the  catalyzing  element  that  triggered  the  beginning of competition in the mobile services sector, as the first private service  providers began operating in Band B, while state-owned providers continued their  Band A operations.  During this period, Land Mobile Services were known as SMC. The first reg- ulatory  standard  for  SMP,  now  supported  by  the  General  Communications  Law   Law 9,472  [9], approved the guidelines for SMP deployment in Resolution  235  [10]. Still in 2000, Resolution  245 [11] and Resolution  248 [12] were issued,  establishing  the  SMP  Master  Authorization  Plan.  This  set  of  three  resolutions  composed  the  initial  framework  for  migrating  SMC  to  SMP  and  increasing  the  number of authorized SMP service providers.  A relevant evolution took place in 2010, with the publication of Resolution   550 [13], regulating Virtual Network SMP exploration  RRVSMP . Additionally,  service  quality  was  defined  by  the  Master  Quality  Plan   PGMQ ,  published  in  Resolution  317 [14] gauged by the quality indicators established in Resolution   335 and measured in compliance with Resolution  443 [15]. SMP is currently  regulated by Resolution  477 [16], supported by the Master Authorization Plan  defined in Resolution  321 [17] and gauged by PGMQ-SMP.  2.1.3   Multimedia Communication Services  Until August 2001, the transmission of multimedia communication data was sup- ported  by  Special  Limited  Services   SLE ,  using  the  sub-modalities  Specialized  Network  Services   SRE   and  Specialized  Circuit  Services   SCE ,  as  well  as  the  Telecommunications  Transport  Network  Services   SRTT ,  comprising  Dedicated  Line  Services   SLD ,  Packet  Switched  Network  Services   SRCP ,  and  Circuit  Switched  Network  Services   SRCC ,  all  general   collective   interest  services.  In  2001,  ANATEL  published  Resolution    272  [18],  defining  SCM  regulatory  standards.  In  2003,  ANATEL  published  Resolution    328  [19],  approving  models  for  the Term of Authorization for SCM exploration, which could also be adapted for  SLE and SRTT authorizations. Resolution  614 [20], besides improving several    Brazilian Telecommunications Regulatory …  31  features  used  on  an  experimental  basis  during  the  first  years  of  authorization,  established the milestones for increasing widespread use of the SCM services.  2.2   Restricted Interest Services—Limited Private Services  The SLP regulatory framework has its origin in Law 4,117 [21], which established  the  Brazilian  Telecommunications  Code.  Chapter  6  of  this  law  defines  limited  services: “a limited service is that provided by stations not open to public corre- spondence to be utilized by Brazilian private citizens or companies. Such limited  services include, security, regularity, orientation, and administration of transporta- tion services in general, multiple destinations, rural services, and private services,  to name some”. Not long after that, the first limited service and the SLP submodal- ity were assigned.  Standard  13  [22]  defines  the  characteristics  of  SLP  and  SLE  and  their  sub- modalities:  Private  Mobile  Services,  Private  Radio  Call  Services,  Private  Network Services and Private Radio-Taxi Services, Specialized Mobile Services,  Specialized  Circuit  Services,  Specialized  Network  Services,  and  Specialized  Radio-Taxi Services.  In  2013, ANATEL  published  Resolution    617  [23],  which  consolidated  in  a  single  regulatory  standard  the  following  definition:  “SLP  is  a  restricted  interest  telecommunications  service,  explored  nationwide  or  worldwide  under  a  private  regime, taken by users themselves or rendered to a given group of users, selected  according  to  criteria  defined  by  the  service  provider,  comprising  multiple  appli- cations,  including  the  data  communication,  audio  and  video  signal  communi- cation,  and  voice  and  text  communication,  as  well  as  capturing  and  transmitting  Scientific Data related with the Exploration of the Earth by Satellite, Meteorology  Assistance,  Satellite  Meteorology,  Space  Operations  and  Space  Research”.  This  resolution  revoked  a  large  number  of  regulatory  standards  that  had  become  enacted over the years.  3   Regulatory Framework for Frequency Band Allocation  This topic focuses on regulatory standards regarding the allocation of certain bands  specifically strategic for the development of broadband radio access systems.  3.1   225–470 MHz Sub-Bands  Until  recently,  the  sub-bands  located  in  the  225–470  MHz  UHF  range  had  been  used  by  several  narrowband  voice  and  telemetry  services,  especially    32  SLP  and  Private  Mobile  Limited  Services   SLMP .  In  2010,  ANATEL  pub- lished Resolutions  555 [24], 556 [25], 557 [26], and 558 [27], reassigning fre- quency  bands  from  225  to  270  MHz,  360  to  380  MHz,  380  to  400  MHz,  and  450  to  470  MHz,  respectively.  Resolutions    555  and  558  stand  out  from  the  other  regulatory  standards  since  they  assign  sub-bands  in  the  250  and  450  MHz  range, with wide channels able to handle broadband radio access systems opera- tions. These resolutions partially replace the standards enacted by the Ministry of  Communications in Decree 623 [28].  ANATEL  launched  Resolution    558,  which  allocates  the  sub-bands  from  451.5875  to  454  MHz,  from  456.5875  to  459  MHz  for  airport  SLP,  and  of  Resolution  446 [29], which regulates this service specifically. These sub-bands  occupy part of the uplink sub-band allocated to PSTN, SMP, and SCM for broad- band  network  access.  The  conditions  for  the  coexistence  of  these  services  and  airport  SLP  are  defined  in  Resolution    446,  which  defines  a  10  km  protected  perimeter around all national airports identified in the resolution.  3.2   698–806 MHz Sub-Bands  The  digitalization  brought  about  by  the  deployment  of  the  Brazilian  Digital  TV  System  SBTVD  opened up the possibility for a more efficient use of the spec- trum assigned to TV services. Moreover, the fact that the chosen digital transmis- sion standard allows signals to be repeated isofrequentially  on the same channel ,  optimizing  spectrum  use.  For  a  proper  analysis  of  the  current  and  future  alloca- tion of the 700 MHz frequency band, it is important to bear in mind the following  issues:   a   The frequency band known as the 700 MHz band is located between the 698  and 806 MHz frequencies. Today, this band is allocated to Sound and Image  Broadcasting Services  TV , occupying UHF channels 52–69;   b   The  Basic  Digital  TV  Plan   PBTVD   proposes  allocating  channels  14–59    470–746 MHz  for DTV in Brazil;   c   Channels  60–68   746–800  MHz   have  been  earmarked  for  Television  and   Public Digital Television Retransmission Services.  Figure 1 illustrates this issue within the scope of the digital divide to be obtained once  the migration from analog-to-digital TV has been completed, scheduled for 2016.  Fig. 1   Analogue-to-digital  TV migration   Brazilian Telecommunications Regulatory …  33  In  their  2008  Radio  Regulations  edition  [30],  ITU-R  allocated  the  698– 806  MHz  range  to  IMT   mobile  services .  In  2009,  Decree    24  [31]  approved  the  General  Standard  for  Executing  Public  Digital  Television  Services,  defining  channels  60–68   746–800  MHz   for  this.  In  2010,  Decree    276  [32]  approved  the  Technical  Standard  for  Executing  Sound  and  Images  Broadcasting  Services  and  Television  Retransmission  with  digital  technology.  According  to  the  stand- ard, the allocation of the 54–88 MHz sub-bands in Very High Frequency  VHF ,  channels 2–6, no longer existed; the allocation of sub-bands 174–216 MHz  VHF  channels  7–13   and  470–800  MHz   UHF  channels  14–68   was  maintained;  the  608–614 MHz sub-band, corresponding to channel 37, is internationally allocated  to  radioastronomy  services  on  a  primary  basis;  and  60–68  are  exclusively  for  Television and Public Digital Television Retransmission Services.  ANATEL  Resolution    584  [33],  in  2012,  changed  the  Regulations  for  Channeling  and  Terms  of  Radio  Frequency  Use  for  SARC,  RpTV,  and  CFTV,  besides enacting other measures. Among these measures, Chap. 17 called for stud- ies  to  be  carried  out  until  December  2012  to  define  future  use  of  the  radio  fre- quency spectrum, especially the 698–806 MHz range. Decree  681 [34], in 2012,  established a Work Group to study conditions for using the radio frequency range  of 698–806 MHz. Recommendation ITU-R M.1036-4 [35] reinforced the alloca- tion  of  the  698–806  MHz  range,  indicated  by WRC-2007,  to  IMT,  as  shown  in  Fig. 2.  The  1.5  GHz  band  was  first  assigned  to  fixed  services  in  Resolution    198  [36],  which  revoked  Standard    15,  from  1994.  This  resolution  established  the  frequency  channeling  and  terms  of  use  of  the  1427–1452  MHz  and  1492– 1517  MHz  bands  for  fixed  service  digital  systems,  with  transmission  capacity   Fig. 2   Allocation of the 698–806 MHz range for IMT   34  Fig. 3   Definition of frequency bands for the E-UTRA aerial interface  of  2  ×  2  Mbps  for  point-to-point  and  point-to-multipoint  applications.  Later,  Resolution  391 [37], published in January 24, 2005, approved Regulations for  the Terms of Radiofrequency Use in the 1452–1472 MHz range, assigned to air  force mobile services, for Telemetry applications, on a primary basis, the 1452– 1466 MHz radio frequency range, and on a secondary basis, the 1466–1472 MHz  range,  and  assigned  the  1452–1492  MHz  radio  frequency  range  additionally  to  mobile service, on a primary basis.  Figure 3 is a diagram portraying ANATEL’s allocation based on the two above- mentioned  resolutions,  on  the  ITU-R  Radio  Regulations  2008  issue,  and  on  the  3GPP Forum’s definition of frequency bands for their E-UTRA aerial interface.  Based on this scenario, one can deduce that fixed services, PSTN and SCM in the  case of Brazil, could use the two 25 + 25 MHz segments from 1427 to 1452 MHz  and from 1492 to 1517 MHz ranges for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint appli- cations,  while  mobile  services  could  use  the  6  MHz  segment  between  1466  and  1472 MHz for TDD applications, where SMA-Telemetry would be allocated on a    Brazilian Telecommunications Regulatory …  Table 1   ANATEL SitarWeb system data Service 12-Radio for Private Mobile Service 9-Limited Private Service 46-Radio for Multimedia Communication Service 53-Radio for Personal Mobile Service 175-PSTN  MIN 1429 1429 1429 1429 1429  MAX 1515 1582 1519 1522.5 1526  35  %  1.00 24.00 2.00 7.00 66.00  ENL 28 1127 70 346 3044 4615  secondary basis. However, 3GPP’s definition of bands 11 and 21 compromises the  utilization of the above-mentioned bands. That leaves only the 1518 and 1555 MHz  sub-bands as possibilities for broadband access system allocation.  Several  equipment  manufacturers  supply  products  for  operation  in  this  fre- quency  range,  called WiGrid,  used  by  the WiMAX  Forum.  The  technical  speci- fications  of  these  products  indicate  they  are  for  use  in  the  1330–1530  MHz  or  1350–1517 MHz frequency range. This segment of the spectrum is currently allo- cated  to  several  services  and  according  to  the ANATEL  SitarWeb  [38]  system’s  directory of granted licenses, 4,615 licenses have been distributed among PSTN,  SLP, and point-to-point radio link licenses for SCM and SMP support  Table 1 .  4   Regulatory Framework for Certification and Approval   of Telecommunication Products  This section presents an overview of the context and the current stage of product  certification in Brazil.  4.1   Classification of Telecommunication Products  For  certification  and  approval  purposes,  telecommunication  products  are  segre- gated in three categories, according to their applications and use:   a   Category I: Terminal equipment for use by the general public to access col-  lective interest telecommunication services;   b   Category  II:  Equipment  not  included  in  the  Category  I  definition,  but  that  uses  the  radio  electric  spectrum  to  transmit  signals,  including  antennas  and  all equipment characterized under specific regulations as restricted radiation  radio-communication equipment;   c   Category  III:  Products  that  do  not  fit  the  definitions  of  Categories  I  and  II,  and need to be regulated to ensure the interoperability and reliability of the  telecommunication support networks.   36  4.2   Magnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety   Requirements  In  2000,  ANATEL  published  Resolution    237  [39]  and  Resolution    238  [40],  approving  Regulatory  Standards  for  the  Certification  of  Telecommunication  Equipment  regarding  Electromagnetic  Compatibility  Aspects  and  regarding  Electrical Safety Aspects, respectively. These resolutions were revised and updated  in  2006  and  2009.  In  2006, ANATEL  published  Resolution    442  [41]  approving  Regulatory Standards for the Certification of Telecommunication Equipment regard- ing Electromagnetic Compatibility Aspects and revoked Resolution  237. In 2009,  ANATEL published Resolution  529 [42], approving Regulatory Standard for the  Certification of Telecommunication Equipment regarding Electrical Safety Aspects  and  revoked  Resolution    238.  In  general,  all  telecommunication  equipment  must  meet  the  compatibility  and  safety  requirements  defined  in  Resolutions    442  and  529, respectively.  Another  caveat  to  be  made  to  EMC  and  Safety  requirements  is  on  its  appli- cability on the respective Resolutions’  BS and Terminal  Previous regulations— Technical  Requirements  and  Test  Procedures  Applicable  to  Telecommunication  Products  Certification  in  Category  I  and  II,  respectively,  from April  16  and  17,  2013  [43,  44].  It  was  a  directive  from  ANATEL  to  protect  the  public  in  gen- eral,  not  including  certain  regulatory  tests  in  the  framework  of  the  equipment  intended  for  Operators’  Companies,  being  more  strict  for  Category  I  equipment   Terminals—Estação Terminal de Acesso and Telefone Móvel Celular  when com- pared  to  the  equipment  classified  as  Category  II   Base  Stations—Transceptores  para Estação Rádio Base . Until 2015 the mandatory tests for Terminals included  the full execution of the Amendments to the Resolutions  442  EMC  and  529   Safety ,  while  Base  Stations  were  tested  only  for  Emission  aspects   Title  II  of  Annex to Resolution  442 , not including Immunity tests and three paragraphs in  the Annex to Resolution  529, when applicable.  This  understanding  was  recently  changed  and  in  the  new  issue—Technical  Requirements  and  Test  Procedures  Applicable  to  Telecommunication  Products  Certification in Category I and II, respectively, from June 1 and April, 2015 [45,  46]—the EMC and Safety tests  Annexes to the Resolutions  442 and  529  are  demanded in the full, both for Terminals and Base Stations.  4.3   Base Transceiver Stations and Terminal Requirements  In April 2004, ANATEL published Resolution  361 [47], approving the Standard  for  the  Certification  and  Approval  of  Analogue  FM  and  PM  Mono-channel  Transmitters  and  Transceivers  Operating  in  the  Under-1  GHz  Frequency  Range.  This  resolution  replaced  Standard  01 89—Technical  Specifications  Standard  for  Mono-channel  Radio  Equipment  in  the  30–470  MHz  range  with  Angular    Brazilian Telecommunications Regulatory …  37  Modulation—and  Standard  02 89—Measurement  Method  Standard  for  Mono- channel  Radio  Equipment  in  the  30–470  MHz  range  with Angular  Modulation.  For  lack  of  specific  regulatory  standards  for  the  certification  and  approval  of  under-1 GHz digital transceivers, this standard was adapted to delineate the techni- cal  requirements  for  radio  access  equipment  in  process  of  development,  produc- tion, and commercialization.  Still in the same year, ANATEL published Resolution  368 [48] to attend to  the  demand  for  the  certification  of WLL  products  for  PSTN  services. This  reso- lution defined the general and specific technical requirements to be demonstrated  in  the  evaluation  of  the  conformance  of  digital  transmitters  and  transceivers   CDMA and TDMA, including GSM  for fixed services in point–multipoint appli- cations  operating  in  over-1  GHz  frequency  ranges.  In  2006, ANATEL  published  Resolution  433 [49], approving the Standard for the Certification and Approval  of  Transmitters  and  Transceivers  in  Base  Transceiver  Stations   BTS   and  PSTN  Repeater  Stations.  This  resolution  affects  BTS  equipment  operating  in  the  400,  1900, and 3500 MHz ranges, with CDMA or TDMA technology, including GSM.  No  specific  regulatory  standards  were  found  to  support  the  process  of  testing  and certifying OFDM OFDMA equipment for base transceiver stations and termi- nals. However, the document describing the technical requirements and test proce- dures for category I telecommunication products, updated on April 16, 2013, and  available on ANATEL’s web site does indicate a sub-set of technical requirements  defined by the 3GPP Forum for the E-UTRA  Long Term Evolution—LTE  aer- ial interface, applicable for a SMP Access Terminal with this technology, that is:  3GPP TS 36.521-1 V9.5.0  2011-06  3GPP; Technical Specification Group Radio  Access  Network;  Evolved  Universal  Terrestrial  Radio  Access   E-UTRA ;  User  Equipment  UE  conformance specification Radio transmission and reception Part  1: Conformance Testing;  Release 9 , in items 6.2.2–6.6.3.1.  The current regulatory scenario for product certification can be summarized as   follows, according to the major globally standardized wireless technologies:   1   WiMAX   IEEE  802.16   equipment  are  classified  as  Digital  Transceptor   Transceptor Digital , fitting into Category II. This understanding is valid for  both Base Stations and Customer Premises Equipment.   2   Wi-Fi   IEEE  802.11   equipment  are  classified  as  Restricted  Radiation   Equipment  Equipamento de Radiação Restrita , also in Category II.   3   4G  LTE  equipment, as well as the legacy mobile technology  2G, 3G , are   classified as:  a   BS—BTS—Category II.  b   Customer Premises Equipment  CPE —Access Terminal Station  ETA ,    c   Handsets  and  Tablets—Cellular  Mobile  Telephone   Telefone  Móvel   Category I.

Additionally new resolutions have been issued for different technologies and fre- quency bands, as well as the addition of more recent 3GPP standards references  for  LTE  equipment  in  the  regulatory  framework,  focusing  essentially  on  the    38  protection of the electromagnetic spectrum  the tests demanded usually focus on  the Transmission characteristics, not covering the reception .

EMC and Safety regulatory framework covered in item 3.2.   Brazilian Telecommunications Regulatory …  39  5   Antenna Requirements  In  2004,  ANATEL  published  Resolution    366  [55],  approving  the  Standard  for  the  Certification  and  Approval  of  Linear  Antennas  and  replaced  Standard    08 95—Minimum  Linear  Antenna  Radiation  Characteristics.  In  2004,  ANATEL  also  published  Resolution    372  [56],  which  approved  the  Standard  for  the  Certification  and  Approval  of  Directional  and  Omnidirectional  Antennas.  In  2013, ANATEL published Resolution  609 [57], approving the Standard for the  Certification and Approval of Antennas for Use in Point-to-Point Applications and  Resolution  610 [58], approving the Standard for the Certification and Approval  of  Antennas  for  Use  in  Bidirectional  Point-to-Area  Applications.  This  standard  applies  to  antennas  in  operation  in  bidirectional  point-to-area  systems  for  fixed  and  mobile  terrestrial  services,  for  the  138  MHz  to  40.5  GHz  bands,  with  gain  equal to or above 8.5 dBi for omnidirectional antennas and above or equal to 9.5  dBi for all other antennas. Furthermore, the standard rules that telecommunication  terminals equipped with gain antennas lower than 8.5 dBi, in the case of omnidi- rectional antennas, and 9.5 dBi, in the case of all others, must meet the require- ments of the certification standards and of the services they are designated for.  6   Conclusions  Based on what has been set forth throughout this chapter, it can be observed that,  regarding telecommunication services, PSTN had its moment of wireless technol- ogy application when WLL systems were deployed. This initiative occurred in a  specific scenario, when PSTN and SMP service providers, during the SMC period,  were separate companies and even competitors. Today, the vast majority of service  providers own licenses for PSTN, SMP, and more often than not, for SCM as well. SCM, in turn, is an important tool for the operation of public policies aiming  to universalize broadband access through small- and medium-sized private carri- ers. Another publication, Resolution  617 2013, consolidated SLP definitions in a  single regulatory standard, causing a major impact on services rendered by public  and private organizations.  Thus,  if  we  take  into  consideration  the  strategies  for  the  development  of  4G  and  beyond  broadband  radio  access  technology  systems  in  Brazil,  the  following  impacts and opportunities can be highlighted:   a   PSTN: Wireless  broadband  access  system  represents  an  important  competi- tive  tool  for  PSTN  service  providers,  allowing  them  to  launch  new  market  strategies.  However,  the  systemic  requirement  must  ensure  the  exclusive  requirements of these public general  collective  interest services, that is, the  universality and continuity of such services;   b   SMP: Mobile broadband access technology is naturally applicable to the SMP  access networks of SMP service providers. Regarding its systemic requirements,    40  special attention must be paid to the issues of network sharing and virtualiza- tion, essential tools for compliance with recent regulatory standards and for sup- porting the exponential growth of users and traffic, especially data;   c   SCM: As  with  PSTN,  a  network  access  platform  with  4G  technology  is  an  important market entry tool, giving small- and medium-sized service provid- ers a strategic competitive edge. Regarding its systemic requirements, special  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  issue  of  network  scalability  and  total  cost  of  ownership, critical for the feasibility of small- and medium-sized companies’  business plans when attempting to penetrate competitive markets;   d   SLP: The need for applications to support the various SLP operation modal- ities  opens  up  an  entire  universe  of  niche  opportunities  for  4G  and  beyond  technologies.  In  this  case,  special  attention  must  be  given  to  the  regulatory  trends  triggered  by  Resolution    617,  which  consolidated  the  various  lim- ited  services  under  a  unified  regime,  and  to  the  impacts  of  future  termina- tion of the allocation and assignment of frequency bands to the different SLP  modalities. This refarming began with the 4.9 GHz band and with the VHF  and UHF sub-bands located between 215 and 470 MHz. Thus, future speci- fications are expected to define modular and flexible requirements for aerial  interfaces currently under development, allowing them to be quickly adjusted  to the new SLP applications.  As for the assignment of frequency bands in Brazil, one can observe from the con- tents of this chapter that the coordination of the radio frequency spectrum usage  by  services  operating  on  a  primary  basis  is  not  a  simple  task.  To  make  things  worse, the radio electric spectrum is a scarce public natural resource, that histori- cally has been inefficiently provisioned. Due to the current state of spectrum sat- uration,  several  complex  issues  of  coexistence  among  neighboring  systems  have  begun to sprout up, usually caused by new co-channel systems, or systems operat- ing in adjacent channels, with existing systems, that fail to meet the requirements  needed  for  coexistence.  For  the  frequency  bands  and  systems  analyzed  in  this  chapter, the following conditions are critical for coexistence:   a   250  MHz  band:  The  225–270  MHz  frequency  range  is  prone  to  suffer  and  generate interference in narrow-band limited services operating in neighbor- ing sub-bands, and in the sound and image broadcasting services  TV , oper- ating in the high VHF segment, between 174 and 216 MHz  channels 7–13 ;   b   450 MHz band: The 451–458 MHz and 461–468 MHz frequency range are  prone to suffer and generate interference in narrow-band limited services and  auxiliary  broadcasting  services  operating  in  neighboring  sub-bands,  and  in  the sound and image broadcasting services  TV , operating in the UHF seg- ment, above 470 MHz  channels 14–59 ;   c   700  MHz  band:  The  698–806  MHz  frequency  range  is  prone  to  suffer  and  generate  interference  in  narrow-band  limited  services  and  auxiliary  broad- casting  services  operating  in  neighboring  sub-bands,  and  in  the  sound  and  image  broadcasting  services   TV ,  operating  in  the  UHF  segment,  between  470 and 746 MHz  channels 14–59 ;   Brazilian Telecommunications Regulatory …  41   d   1500  MHz  band:  New  point-to-area  systems  using  part  of  the  1427– 1555 MHz range are not likely to suffer or generate interference in the point- to-point  and  point-to-area  systems  currently  licensed  for  these  frequencies.  However, it has been proven that the new point-to-area systems operating in  these  segments  of  the  spectrum  and  GPS  systems  cause  strong  interference  between themselves.  Several opportunities exist for developing 4G and beyond technologies for radio  access systems, especially for niche applications in frequency bands whose provi- sions have been reformulated to meet the needs of these new applications. In such  cases, special attention must be paid to the air interface specifications, in order to  mitigate coexistence issues with pre-established neighboring systems.  Finally,  regarding  the  requirements  for  certification  and  approval,  it  can  be  observed that the set of standards regulating telecommunication products for their  certification  and  approval  can  be  grouped  into  three  categories  in  terms  of  their  compliance  with  new  technology  and  the  frequency  bands  assigned  to  4G  and  beyond radio access systems, as follows:   a   The requirements for electromagnetic compatibility and electrical protection  are the same for all telecommunication equipment and are consolidated and  consistent;   b   The  requirements  for  antenna  approval  have  been  updated  recently  and  are  compliant with the latest international standards and adequate for the newest  broadband radio access systems;   c   The regulatory standards for the certification and approval of base transceiver  stations and access terminals, on the other hand, still need to be updated, or  even created, to meet the needs of 4G systems and coexistence among systems.

The  antenna  array  operates  in  the  frequency  band  of  450 MHz and it is intended to provide broadband access to suburban, rural, and  remote  areas.  The  proposed  array  is  composed  of  four  dual-polarized  crossed  dipoles  placed  a  quarter-wavelength  above  a  reflector.  The  antenna  operates  with  ±45   slanted  polarization  diversity  with  a  horizontal  beamwidth  of  65 .  The main advantages are the use of expanded metal in the reflector and individ- ual radomes per element, which reduces the weight and wind load of the antenna.  These advantages, aligned with fully integrated solutions for the structure and low- cost materials, make it an attractive solution for base station antennas.  1   Introduction  From 2012 to 2015, CPqD Foundation was responsible for the project of an inte- grated solution to provide broadband access to suburban, rural, and remote areas  [1].  The  proposed  solution  is  based  on  Long  Term  Evolution   LTE   technology  and operates in the frequency range of 450–470 MHz, which was recently added  to  LTE  Standard  with  the  technical  support  of  CPqD  and  other  companies  [2].  The project comprises the development of an Evolved Node B  eNodeB , a User   D.C. de Souza e Silva  *  · C.B. de Paula  CPqD Foundation, Campinas, SP, Brazil e-mail: diogos@cpqd.com.br  C.B. de Paula  e-mail: cborges@cpqd.com.br    Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016  A.

In  the  context  of  this  project,  a  directional  antenna  was  developed for installation in the eNodeB. The most suitable antenna for this appli- cation is the sector panel antenna, which presents directive radiation pattern in the  vertical plane and sectorial radiation pattern in the horizontal plane. This charac- teristic allows to divide the cell site coverage into sectors, depending on the hori- zontal beamwidth of the antenna, in which the most used beamwidth sector in a  three-sector cell is 65  as shown in [3].  In  this  chapter,  a  ±45º  slant-polarized  antenna  array  operating  at  450  MHz  band is proposed, which has as main differentials low values of weight, cost, and  wind  load.  Low  weight  and  wind  load  reduce  the  structural  requirements  of  the  tower  and  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  overall  installation  cost.  The  ±45º  slanted polarization is used as antenna diversity to mitigate the multipath effects  on radio channel. Polarization diversity is widely used nowadays due to the pos- sibility of reducing the space and installation cost as compared to spatial diversity  [4]. The ±45º slanted polarization offers some benefits due to the symmetry of the  antenna that result in equal radiation patterns for each polarization. Furthermore,  the  results  of  field  trials  are  slightly  better  for  ±45º  than  H V  polarization  as  shown in [5, 6]. The  chapter  is  organized  as  follows.  Sect.  2  describes  the  proposed  radiating  element, the employed materials, and the main results. In this section the simpli- fication adopted in the model of the radiating element that ensures faster simula- tions and lower memory consumption is also included. Sect. 3 shows the proposed  four-element  array,  including  the  corporate  feed  network  that  provides  the  nec- essary current for each element to synthesize the desired radiation pattern in the  broadside  direction.  The  radiation  pattern  in  the  main  planes  and  the  scattering  parameters  for  each  port  are  also  shown  in  this  section.  Finally,  the  conclusions  and considerations of the antenna array are offered in Sect. 4. The main require- ments of this project are summarized in Table 1.

The  crossed  dipole  structure  is  the  most  used  and  sometimes  approximates  to  bow-tie  dipoles  or  corner-driven  square  loops.  The  elements  are  usually  composed  of  printed  cir- cuits or metallic pieces, e.g., wires, tubes, or planar sheets [4]. The proposed ele- ment is a crossed half-wavelength dipole constructed with aluminum round tubes.  The  crossed  dipole  consists  of  two  dipoles  placed  perpendicular  to  each  other.  Additionally, the crossed dipole is placed a quarter-wavelength above the reflector  and their arms are supported by tubular posts. The junction between the arm and  the post defines a unique tubular structure and it can be obtained by soldering the  extremities of two tubes cut in 45º angle. In addition, each one of the dipoles is fed  by a quarter-wave coaxial balun.  The balun has two functions:  1  convert unbalanced signal into balanced sig- nal  at  the  terminals  of  the  dipole;   2   transform  the  dipole  input  impedance  into  a  desired  impedance.  The  proposed  λ 4  coaxial  balun  is  divided  into  two  parts  and  it  integrates  fully  to  the  tubular  structure. The  first  part  is  the  coaxial  struc- ture formed by supporting posts and their inner conductor. The second part is the  Γ-shaped  probe  formed  by  an  aluminum  sheet  bent  and  two  screws.  Since  the  structure has two dipoles placed perpendicularly, the two probes must be mirrored  to each other, in order to avoid mechanical intersections. The probe width is a half  diameter of the tubular structure. One post has in its interior a copper wire creat- ing a coaxial line and it is called main post. The other post has no inner conduc- tor and it is called stub post. The Γ-shaped probe is supported slightly above the  dipoles  and  provides  electrical  contact  between  the  inner  conductor  of  the  main  post  and  the  stub  post.  Connections  between  the  main  post  and  the  probe  are  prohibited.  For  this  reason,  it  requires  a  non-metallic  piece  to  support  the  probe  and isolate the inner conductor. In contrast, it is necessary to fix a metal piece to  the stub post. The short circuit among posts, at the reflector plane, completes the  λ 4 balun topology. The input N-type connector is placed at the base of the main  post. The center pin is connected to the inner conductor and the connector body is  attached to the reflector structure. An individual radome, covering the balun struc- ture,  is  utilized  to  avoid  accumulation  of  water,  which  would  results  in  changes  in the material properties and, consequently, impedance mismatch. For the same  reason, the extremities of the dipoles are covered and sealed. The proposed dipole  structure is detailed in Fig. 1 in a cut view. In this representation, only one of the  dipoles is shown, while the other one is omitted in order to clarify the visualiza- tion of the structure. In Fig. 2 it is shown a closely viewed of the crossed dipole,  where it is possible to see the two Γ-shaped probes mirrored.  To implement the coaxial balun, the height of the supporting posts assumes val- ues  equal  to  λ 4  and  it  was  optimized  to  be  171.27  mm.  The  separation  among  these posts is defined as the shortest distance between the outer diameter of them  and it was designed to be approximately λ 20, which results in 30 mm. The dipole    48  D.C. de Souza e Silva and C.B. de Paula  Fig. 1   Cut view of the  dipole structure  Metallic support  Γ-shaped probe  Non-metallic support  Stub post  Radome  Main post  Inner solid wire  Fig. 2   Close view of the  Γ-shaped probes  length is designed to be λ 2 and optimized to get a real impedance at their input  terminals. Therefore, each arm has the length optimized for 126.06 mm. Note that  one of the extremities is cut in 45º angle and the length is measured on the larger  side. All  dimensions  mentioned  above  are  designed  for  the  center  frequency  of  460  MHz. The  completely  tubular  structure  was  designed  with  a  5 8″  aluminum  round  tube. This  tube  has  the  inner  diameter  of  9.87  mm  and  outer  diameter  of  15.87  mm.  It  is  known  that  the  outer  diameter  is  related  to  the  input  impedance  stability  of  the  dipole  [8]. Accordingly,  the  outer  diameter  is  proportional  to  the  frequency bandwidth and it was selected to ensure the impedance matching at the  frequency range of 450–470 MHz. Besides, the wall thickness was chosen to facil- itate junction among the tubes.  The optimized length of the dipole provides a real impedance of around 110 Ω  at  a  reference  plane  on  the  top  of  balun  structure. The  desired  impedance  at  the  input  connector  is  equal  to  50  Ω.  The  impedance  matching  can  be  achieved  by  adjusting  the  characteristic  impedance  of  the  coaxial  line.  This  characteristic  impedance  is  obtained  from  the  square  root  of  the  product  of  these  impedances  and  results  in  approximately  74  Ω.  The  characteristic  impedance  of  a  coax  line  depends  on  the  diameter  of  the  conductors  and  the  dielectric  permittivity  of  the    Dual-Polarized Crossed Dipole Antenna Array for LTE Base Station  49  medium. The diameter of the outer conductor is equal to 9.87 mm and it is delim- ited by the inner diameter of the tube. Considering that the structure is filled with  air, the diameter of the inner conductor is determined as being 2.87 mm [9]. This  diameter can be approximated to 2.9 mm  AWG 9  and it is possible to use a solid  bare  copper  wire.  The  individual  radome  intended  to  protect  the  feed  structure  from the weather conditions is a plastic PVC pipe covered on the top with a cap  of  the  same  material.  The  arms  of  the  dipoles  are  exteriorized  from  the  radome  through  four  holes  punched  on  the  plastic  body.  The  pipe  has  an  inner  diame- ter equal to 96 mm and an outer diameter equal to 101.6 mm. The height of the  radome is equal to 190 mm measured from the base of the reflector. The dimen- sions of the crossed dipoles are shown in Fig. 3.  A  crossed  dipole  above  a  plane  reflector  provides  a  horizontal  beamwidth  of  around 90 . The beamwidth of 65º can be obtained using bent reflectors. The bent  reflector is divided into three parts: one plane part and two side tabs bent in angle.  Thus, there are three different variables to adjust the beamwidth: the width of the  plane part, the width of the bent parts, and the angle among them. Considering the  angle  among  the  parts  as  135º,  the  widths  are  optimized  to  be  equal  to  455  and  110 mm, for the plane part and the bent parts, respectively. It results in a reflec- tor with an overall width of 610 mm and depth of 77 mm. The reflector height of  the  one-element  antenna  is  designed  to  be  approximately  3λ 4,  which  results  in  500  mm. To  provide  mechanical  resistance  to  structure,  the  reflector  is  mounted  on a frame built with square tubes. The reflector was designed using an expanded  metal instead of a sheet metal, with the purpose to reduce the weight and the wind  load of the structure. As a reference, Part Number F25X12A of the manufacturer  Telas Nova Era® was selected in this project [10].

This open area reduces  the reflector weight to 23 %, as compared to the sheet metal of the same material.  The dimensions of the reflector are shown in Fig. 4.  The  radiating  elements  described  above  were  analyzed  by  full-wave  commer- cial software MWS CST® [11]. The frequency range of analysis was from 370 to  570 MHz and the simulations were performed using the frequency domain solver.  The  antenna  ports  were  excited  by  waveguide  ports  and  the  ports  1  and  2  are  related  to  the −45   and +45   polarization,  respectively.  Besides,  it  was  observed  that  the  complexity  of  the  expanded  metal  employed  on  the  reflector  has  a  great  impact on the simulation time and the memory usage of the workstation. For com- parison  purposes,  the  simulation  time  was  35  min  for  sheet  and  66  min  for  the  expanded  metal.  Furthermore,  the  memory  usage  was  4.5  GB  for  the  sheet  and  8.5 GB for the expanded metal. The hardware setup for the simulation consisted of  a Dell workstation with an Intel® Xeon® CPU X5650 2.67 GHz; 48 GB of RAM;  operational  system  MS  Windows7  Professional.  In  a  worst  case,  considering  the  four-element array and the reflector built with expanded metal, the memory usage  reaches the total available memory on the workstation, making the analysis impossi- ble. Thus, it was necessary to simplify the electromagnetic model to render the array   m m 0 0 5     135º  455 mm  Fig. 4   Reflector dimensions  610 mm  77 mm   Dual-Polarized Crossed Dipole Antenna Array for LTE Base Station  51  analysis  feasible.  To  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  usage  of  a  sheet  metal  instead  of  expanded metal on the electrical characteristics of the antenna array, the results were  compared against each other. Despite this, it is important to note that it is just a sim- plification of the electromagnetic model and does not change the proposed structure. The simulated results of the magnitude of the scattering parameters at the input  of the antennas are shown in Fig. 5. From the reflection coefficients, S11 and S22,  it is possible to note that the elements can operate in a frequency range from 410  to 540 MHz, considering the threshold of −10 dB. The slight difference between  S11 and S22 is due to the fact of that the  Γ-shaped probes were mirrored in the  dipoles. In addition, the isolation between the port 1 and 2 is higher than 30 dB  in  all  the  frequency  range. All  scattering  parameters  are  normalized  to  50  Ω.  In  Fig.  6  the  radiation  pattern  for  the  main  and  cross  polarizations,  calculated  in  the  horizontal  plane  and  at  the  center  frequency  of  460  MHz,  is  shown.  In  the  same way, the radiation pattern in the vertical plane is shown in Fig. 7. The half  power  beamwidth  is  equal  to  65   and  77   for  the  horizontal  and  vertical  planes,  respectively. The gain is 8.15 dBi on the broadside direction. According to what  is  observed,  there  is  an  excellent  agreement  between  the  simulated  results  given  for the reflector using a sheet and expanded metal. This result was expected since,  a solid ground plane can be simulated, especially at low frequencies, by a metal  mesh  with  openings  lower  than  1 10  of  the  wavelength  [8].  In  comparison,  the  larger opening of the expanded metal is equal to 25 mm that represents only 4 100  of  the  wavelength  at  the  center  frequency  of  460  MHz.  The  major  difference  is  noted for the front-to-back ratio that is equal to −44 and −40 dB for the sheet and  expanded  metal  reflectors,  respectively. This  difference  can  be  disregarded  since  that both scenarios meet the requirements of front-to-back ratio higher than 25 dB.     -  B d     s r e t e m a r a P S   e h t   f o   e d u t i n g a M  0  -10  -20  -30  -40  -50  S11 - Sheet metal S11 - Expanded metal  S22 - Sheet metal S22 - Expanded metal S12 - Sheet metal S12 - Expanded metal  370  390  410  430  510  530  550  570  470  490 450 Frequency  MHz   Fig. 5   Magnitude of the S-parameters, in logarithmic scale, of the radiating element   60 60  90 90  120 120  60 60  90 90  120 120  52   a   0 0  -10 -10  -20 -20  -20 -20  -10 -10  0 0  0 0  -10 -10  -20 -20  -20 -20  -10 -10  0 0  300 300  240 240  300 300  240 240  D.C. de Souza e Silva and C.B. de Paula  0 0  0 0  330 330  30 30  330 330  30 30   b   60 60  300 300  120 120  240 240  60 60  300 300  120 120  240 240  0 0  -10 -10  -20 -20  -20 -20  -10 -10  0 0  0 0  -10 -10  -20 -20  -20 -20  -10 -10  0 0  -30 -30 -30 -30  270 270  90 90  -30 -30 -30 -30  270 270  210 210  210 210   Co-pol. - Sheet metal  Cross-pol. - Sheet metal  Co-pol. - Expanded metal  Cross-pol. - Expanded metal  150 150   Co-pol. - Sheet metal  Cross-pol. - Sheet metal  Co-pol. - Expanded metal  Cross-pol. - Expanded metal  150 150  Fig.  6   Co-polar  and  cross-polar  radiation  pattern  in  the  horizontal  plane  at  460  MHz.  a  Port  1 −45  polarization. b Port 2 +45  polarization   a    b   330 330  30 30  330 330  30 30  180 180  0 0  180 180  0 0  -30 -30 -30 -30  270 270  90 90  -30 -30 -30 -30  270 270  210 210  180 180   Co-pol. - Sheet metal  Cross-pol. - Sheet metal  Co-pol. - Expanded metal  Cross-pol. - Expanded metal  150 150  210 210  180 180   Co-pol. - Sheet metal  Cross-pol. - Sheet metal  Co-pol. - Expanded metal  Cross-pol. - Expanded metal  150 150  Fig.  7   Co-polar  and  cross-polar  radiation  pattern  in  the  vertical  plane  at  460  MHz.  a  Port  1 −45  polarization. b Port 2 +45  polarization  3   Antenna Array  The radiating elements are vertically arranged, forming a linear array, in order to  provide the required gain. The vertical arrangement is the most suitable because it  increases the gain and does not change the horizontal beamwidth, which defines  the cell sector. This gain is achieved by focusing the energy in the vertical plane,  i.e., narrowing the vertical beamwidth [4]. The array is composed of four radiat- ing elements spaced from 3λ 4, what represents 490 mm at the center frequency  of  460  MHz.  To  assess  the  impact  of  the  simplified  model  on  the  final  electric  characteristics  of  the  array,  a  preliminary  analysis  of  the  array  considering  just  two  radiating  elements  was  performed.  The  major  purpose  of  this  analysis  is  to    Dual-Polarized Crossed Dipole Antenna Array for LTE Base Station  53  evaluate the behavior of the port-to-port isolation, and in a special way, the isola- tion  between  ports  that  operates  at  the  same  polarization. The  isolation  between  elements that operate at same polarization could not be performed in Sect. 2, and it  is fundamental to validate the simplified model for the electromagnetic analysis of  the array. The ports related to the −45  polarization are numbered with odd num- bers. The ports related to the +45  polarization are numbered with even numbers.  Thus, the first radiating element is composed of the ports 1 and 2 and the second  radiating element is composed of the ports 3 and 4.  The  simulated  results  from  the  magnitude  of  the  port-to-port  isolation  at  the  input of the antennas are shown in Fig. 8. To clarify the visualization of the results,  the port 1 was taken as the reference and the isolations were computed from it.  Due  to  the  reciprocity  of  the  structure,  the  other  results  were  omitted  from  this  graph. The isolation between the ports at same polarization is defined as the neg- ative  of  the  magnitude  of  S13  and  it  is  higher  than  20  dB  in  all  the  frequency  range. The  magnitude  of  S14  relates  to  the  isolation  between  ports  with  differ- ent polarizations and spaced from 3λ 4. Finally, the magnitude of S12 relates to  the isolation between ports of the same radiating element. Once again, there is an  excellent  agreement  between  the  simulated  results,  which  demonstrates  that  the  simplified  model  is  suitable  for  analysis  of  the  four-element  array.  For  compari- son purposes, the simulation time was 60 min for the sheet and 135 min for the  expanded  metal.  Furthermore,  the  memory  usage  was  8.5  GB  for  the  sheet  and  17.5 GB for the expanded metal.  The  final  model  of  the  antenna  array,  composed  of  four  radiating  elements,  is  shown  in  Fig.  9.  Due  to  the  limited  capacity  of  memory,  the  analysis  of  this  array built with expanded metal was not feasible. Thus, it was needed to adopt the      l  B d     n o i t a o s I   t r o p - o t - t r o P  0  10  20  30  40  50  60   -S12 - Sheet metal  -S12 - Expanded metal  -S13 - Sheet metal  -S13 - Expanded metal  -S14 - Sheet metal  -S14 - Expanded metal  370  390  410  430  510  530  550  570  470  450 490 Frequency  MHz   Fig. 8   Magnitude of the port-to-port isolation in logarithmic scale   54  D.C. de Souza e Silva and C.B. de Paula  Fig. 9   Antenna array  composed of four radiating  elements  simplified model, which replaces the expanded metal by a sheet metal. The reflec- tor of the four-element array has 610 mm in width, 1960 mm in height, and 77 mm  in depth. As the radome height is higher than the reflector depth, the overall depth  of the antenna array is equal to radome height, i.e., 190 mm. The ports of same    Dual-Polarized Crossed Dipole Antenna Array for LTE Base Station  55  polarization  are  combined  into  a  single  connector  by  a  corporate  feed  network  constructed  with  coaxial  cables.  Thereby,  the  connector  1  relates  to  the  −45º  polarization and the connector 2 relates to the +45  polarization. The corporate  network feeds the radiating elements in parallel, splitting the power among them.  To get the maximum gain oriented to broadside direction, it is needed that all the  radiating elements excited with equal amplitude and phase [8].  The corporate feed network is used to feed N = 2n radiating elements, where n  is the number of levels of the feed network. In this project, the number of radiating  elements is four, so that the corporate feed network must have two levels. The first  level divides the input power of the array into two branches. At the second level,  the power in each one of these two branches is divided again into two branches,  which results in four branches and each one of these branches feeds one radiating  element. In the design of this network feed, it is necessary to consider both physi- cal aspects, as the distance between the elements, and the electrical aspects, as the  desired impedance at the input of the array.  The first consideration to be done is that the input of the network feed is located  in the middle of the array structure. Thus, the total physical length of the corporate  feed, composed of two branches, must be, at least, equal to the distance from the  middle of the structure to the radiating elements. Given that the distance between  elements is 490 mm, the total physical length must be, at least, 245 and 735 mm,  for the nearest and farthest elements, respectively. The second consideration is that  the radiating elements are matched to 50 Ω, as well as the desired input impedance  of the feed network matched to 50 Ω. Thereby, it is necessary to use quarter-wave- length impedance transformers on both levels of the network, in order to match all  radiating elements to a single connector. In contrast, the electrical length of each  level given as λ 4 does not meet the minimum physical length of the feed. Thus, λ  is added to the length to repeat the impedance of the elements, before the imped- ance transformation. The resulting electrical length for each level is equal to 450 .  In  this  quarter-wavelength  transformers  coaxial  lines  with  a  characteristic  impedance  of  75  Ω  were  employed.  Ideally,  at  the  second  level  of  the  network,  each  of  the  four  branches  transforms  the  impedance  of  the  elements,  50 Ω,  into  an  impedance  equal  to  112.5 Ω. The  112.5-Ω  impedances  are  connected  in  par- allel, two by two, which results in two impedances of 56.25 Ω. At the first level  of the network, each of the two branches transforms the 56.25 Ω impedance into  an impedance equal to 100 Ω. The 100-Ω impedances are connected in parallel,  which results in 50 Ω at the input of the corporate feed network. Additionally, a  50-Ω coaxial line can be connected to the input of the feed to relocate the array  input connector.  To analyze and optimize the proposed feed network, the Keysight ADS® circuit  simulator  was  employed  [12]. The  simulated  results  from  the  scattering  parame- ters were exported from the CST® to ADS® by a Touchstone file. The optimized  electrical lengths of the branches are 439  and 422 , for the first and second lev- els, respectively. In addition, Part Number C291 360 000, from the manufacturer  Radiall® [13], for the 75-Ω coaxial lines was selected. This part number relates to  an RG59 coaxial cable and has a velocity of propagation equal to 66 %. Thereby,    56  D.C. de Souza e Silva and C.B. de Paula  the  physical  lengths  of  the  cables  are  525  and  504  mm,  for  the  first  and  second   levels, respectively. The simulated corporate feed network, using coaxial line mod- els from the ADS, is shown in Fig. 10. In this simulation a 50-Ω coaxial cable with  100 mm in length to relocate the array input connector was considered. As a refer- ence, Part Number C291 305 000, from the manufacturer Radiall®, can be used for  the 50-Ω coaxial cable. The results from this analysis are shown in Fig. 11. From  the reflection coefficients, S11 and S22, it is possible to note that both polariza- tion  systems  can  operate  in  a  frequency  range  from  420  to  520  MHz,  consider- ing the threshold of −10 dB. Once again, the slight difference between S11 and  S22 is due to the fact that the Γ-shaped probes were mirrored in the dipoles. Also,  the  isolation  between  the  systems  is  20  dB  in  all  the  frequency  range.  It  is  also   Fig. 10   Corporate feed network simulation on ADS     B d     s r e  t  e m a r a P S e h  -     t   f  o     e d u  t i  n g a M  0  -10  -20  -30  -40   S11  S21  S12  S22  370  390  410  430  450  470  490  510  530  550  570  Frequency  MHz   Fig. 11   Magnitude of the S-parameters, in logarithmic scale, of the antenna array   Dual-Polarized Crossed Dipole Antenna Array for LTE Base Station  57  important to point out that the attenuation of the cables is 0.47 and 0.3 dB m for  the RG58 and RG59, respectively. These attenuations result in an insertion loss of  around  0.35  dB  for  the  feed  network.  Considering  possible  losses  in  the  coaxial  junctions, the insertion loss can be approximated to 0.5 dB.  The  simulated  results  from  the  radiation  pattern  of  the  array  are  calculated  using  a  post-processing  tool  that  combines  the  far-field  results,  given  weighted  excitation  for  each  element.  For  the  −45   polarization,  the  radiation  pattern  is  obtained  by  exciting  the  elements  1,  3,  5,  and  7  with  equal  amplitude  and  phase. For the +45  polarization, the radiation pattern is obtained by exciting the  elements 2, 4, 6, and 8 with equal amplitude and phase. In Fig. 12 the radia- tion pattern for the main and cross polarizations, calculated in the horizontal plane  and  at  the  center  frequency  of  460  MHz,  is  shown.  In  the  same  way,  the  radia- tion pattern in the vertical plane is shown in Fig. 13. The half power beamwidth is  equal to 68  and 17  for the horizontal and vertical planes, respectively. The gain  of the radiating elements, disregarding the feed network losses, is 14.5 dBi on the  broadside direction and the front-to-back ratio higher than 38 dB. Since the inser- tion loss of the feed network is estimated as 0.5 dB, the total gain can be approxi- mated  to  14  dBi.  Besides,  the  calculated  gain  deviates  less  than ±0.1  dB  in  all  450  MHz  bands. The  horizontal  half  power  beamwidth  deviates  less  than ±0.8   in  the  same  band.  These  variations  are  in  accordance  with  Anatel  Resolution  610 2013, which specifies a tolerance of ±1 dB for the gain and ±10 % for the  beamwidth [7]. To assess if the antenna array meets the specification of the nor- malized  radiation  pattern  envelope,  the  radiation  pattern  of  the  −45   polariza- tion is shown in Fig. 14, in Cartesian coordinates, for both horizontal and vertical  planes.   a   0   b   0  330  30  330  30  -30 -30  270  90  -30 -30  270  0  -10  -20  -20  -10  0  300  240  60  300  120  240  0  -10  -20  -20  -10  0  210  180  150   Co-Pol.

The  use  of  round  tubes,  combined  with  a  fully  integrated  quar- ter-wavelength  balun,  in  the  structure  of  the  crossed  dipoles  demonstrated  to  be  a  suitable  choice  for  the  radiating  elements,  providing  a  fractional  bandwidth  of  around 27 % for a single radiating element. The usage of coaxial cables of stand- ard impedances in the feed network proved to be a cheap and easy-mount solution,  allowing the antenna array to operate in the frequency range from 420 to 520 MHz  with VSWR  lower  than  2:1  for  both  polarizations.  Furthermore,  the  port-to-port  isolation obtained for this array is equal to 20 dB in all the bandwidth. The desired    Dual-Polarized Crossed Dipole Antenna Array for LTE Base Station  59  beamwidth was achieved through the usage of a bent reflector, which provides a  horizontal  beamwidth  of  around  68   for  both  polarizations. The  antenna  gain  of  14 dBi in the broadside direction was possible due to the vertical arrangement of  radiating elements on the array. Moreover, the employment of the expanded metal  in the reflector proved to be a solution to reduce the weight and wind load of the  antenna, providing a front-to-back ratio higher than 38 dB without disturbing the  synthesized radiation pattern of the array. Finally, the antenna array is in accord- ance with the Anatel standard for certification and homologation, which make it a  possible solution for a further commercial product.

Acesso em: 27 maio. 2015   Evaluation of the LTE 450 MHz System  Performance with Different Terminal  Antennas  Juliano João Bazzo and Paulo Cardieri  Abstract  The  proper  choice  of  the  radiation  characteristics  of  antennas  used  in  LTE terminal is of vital importance, requiring a judicious analysis with appropri- ate tools to evaluate system performance. This chapter evaluates the 450 MHz LTE  system performance with different terminal antennas. The evaluation environment  is carefully configured in a system-based simulator, which takes into account the  ANATEL and 3GPP standards, and the characteristics of commercial antennas and  the geographical distribution of terminals in rural areas. Results show that the use  of directional antennas can improve cell throughput from 14 % to 90 % compared  to the use of omnidirectional antennas. Moreover, terminal throughput at the edge  of the cell is improved by up to 10 times using directional antennas with the same  gain as that of omnidirectional antennas.  1   Introduction  Long Term Evolution  LTE  technology has been intensely developed and stand- ardized  in  several  different  versions,  with  the  intention  of  substituting  the  2G  and  3G  cell  systems  currently  deployed  worldwide.

Cardieri  the  700  MHz  and  2.5  GHz  frequency  ranges  are  the  most  common  choice. The  last  one,  auctioned  in  Brazil  in  2012,  is  already  in  use  in  Europe.  3GPP   Third  Generation Partnership Project  standardization of LTE for the 450 MHz range is  already in an advanced stage, and band 31 has been part of this standard since July  2013, with the ratification of the proposal presented in May of the same year [1].  The success of this system, in any of the frequency ranges mentioned, is based  on  the  access  network’s  planning  capability  and  the  availability  of  simulation  tools to evaluate network performance—particularly in the case of the 450 MHz  frequency  range,  where  the  ability  to  service  extensive  areas  is  one  of  the  main  challenges.  Such  capability  is  particularly  critical  when  it  comes  to  the  wireless  interface,  in  which  performance-limiting  factors,  like  propagation  and  the  char- acteristics of the technology employed, constitute the greatest bottlenecks for the  access network’s capacity. It is therefore necessary to create an appropriate evalu- ation  methodology  that  allows  variation  of  the  system  parameters  and  generates  statistical results for diverse scenarios.  Relevant  factors  for  the  construction  of  these  scenarios  include  density  and  type of distribution of the terminals in the coverage area, the characteristics of the  traffic associated with the services, and how available user plan data transmission  resources are allocated in the aerial interface. The results presented in this chapter  are based on evaluation scenarios built to take into account such factors.  Unlike  other  publications  that  present  results  focusing  on  the  urban  sce- nario,  characterized  by  user  mobility  or  high  building  density,  [2–4],  this  chap- ter explores the preferred scenario for LTE technology operating in the 450 MHz  range in Brazil. This scenario is typically characterized by the absence of mobility,  low building density, extensive coverage areas and, because of current frequency  spectrum regulations, scarce opportunities for frequency reuse.  Because of the requirement to provide coverage in the range of dozens of kilo- meters, described in the next section, it is expected that, based on the propagation  characteristics of Ultra High Frequency  UHF  range frequencies in rural environ- ments,  especially  in  the  case  of  terminals  located  toward  the  edge  of  the  cell  be  connected by directive antennas with a gain superior to that of antennas incorpo- rated in mobile terminals. Therefore, as will be demonstrated throughout the text,  the adequate selection of the radiation characteristics for antennas used in the ter- minals is of vital importance, which creates the need for a thorough analysis, using  the  appropriate  tools,  and  fed  by  a  set  of  parameters  able  to  represent  the  rural  broadband scenario.  This chapter is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents a summary of the intro- duction of the 450 MHz range in the LTE standard, its regulations and forms of  utilization in Brazil. Sect. 3 describes the evaluation scenarios and the parameters  characterizing  them.  The  results  achieved  for  these  scenarios  are  presented  and  discussed in Sect. 4. Finally, the most important results are consolidated and high- lighted in the Conclusion.   Evaluation of the LTE 450 MHz System Performance …  63  2   LTE 450 MHz in Brazil  2.1   Motivation  The LTE 450 MHz technological proposal aimed at bringing broadband Internet  to areas served precariously or without any kind of telecommunication services at  all, as in the case of rural or isolated areas. For LTE systems, this is a new applica- tion profile, operating in the 450–470 MHz band, providing more favorable propa- gation  conditions  resulting  in  coverage  ranges  typically  superior  to  the  currently  standardized 3GPP profiles.  The effort to specify and develop LTE 450 MHz began with the focus on the  Brazilian scenario, where the deployment of this system is expected to help ful- fill the goal of providing universal broadband access to all regions of the country.  These services in rural areas will be made available in expressive portions of the  Brazilian territory, benefiting more than 30 million inhabitants who currently have  no access to broadband services [5].  Recent  initiatives  of  the  Brazilian  government  to  promote  the  National  Broadband  Plan   PNBL   [6]  have  been  stimulating  LTE  450  MHz  as  a  viable  alternative  to  meet  the  goals  of  this  program  in  areas  neglected  up  to  this  time.  According to the PNBL, the application scenario of the highest priority is that of  sparsely populated rural areas, since they present the lowest percentages of homes  with  broadband  Internet  access.  Data  from  the  National  Home  Sample  Research   PNAD ,  conducted  by  Brazilian  National  Geographic  Statistics  Bureau   IBGE ,  in  2008,  and  by Applied  Economic  Research  Bureau   IPEA ,  in  2010,  discloses  that only 5.5 % of homes located in the Brazilian southeastern rural region have  broadband access. Still according to IBGE, the average number of homes per km2  in rural areas is 3.75.  In  rural  areas  without  access  to  any  kind  of  service,  the  advent  of  LTE  450 MHz is most likely the only alternative for providing data and voice services  to their inhabitants.  With this purpose in mind, the Brazilian government recently created policies  to make viable the use of the 450 MHz spectrum, prioritizing rural area services,  as described below.  2.2   Regulatory Aspects  In  2012,  the  government  auctioned  the  operating  licenses,  based  on  ANATEL  Resolution  558  [7].  This  resolution,  besides  defining  frequency  ranges  and  sub- ranges,  established  the  attributions  for  Personal  Mobile  Services   PMS   and  other services, including Multimedia Communication Services  MCS  and Public  Switched Telephone Network  PSTN  in the same sub-ranges, creating room for  the use of mobile, fixed, or nomadic user terminals.   64  J.J. Bazzo and P. Cardieri  Table 1   Requirements of the 4G auction notice for systems operating in the 450 MHz range in  Brazil [8] Time frame 6 30 2014 12 31 2014 12 31 2015 12 31 2017  % of counties covered 30 60 100 100  Rate  upload    kbps  128 128 128 256  Rate  download  256 kbps 256 kbps 256 kbps 1 Mbps  The auction laid a number of obligations on the winning operators, linking the  2.5  GHz  range,  3GPP  band  7,  acquisitions  those  in  the  450  MHz  range,  3GPP  band 31. Besides providing voice services to the cities, goals were defined for the  rendering of retail data services, and services to rural schools  data  and cities with  less than 30,000 inhabitants prioritized. Table 1 shows the minimum transmission  rates and the percentage of cities to be covered by 2017, as required by the gov- ernment auction notice, which also established as criteria the coverage of at least  80 % of the area comprised within a 30 km radius, measured out from the bound- ary of the county seat.  Based  on  this  information,  on  IBGE  statistics,  as  well  as  on  the  results  of  a  study  carried  out  in  Brazil  [9]  calculating  broadband  Internet  occupancy  rate  at  4  %,  a  plausible  estimate  is  that  at  least  21  terminals  with  simultaneous  access  will be needed in the area defined according to county coverage criteria. Due to  the available information regarding rural population distribution, it is important to  point out that this estimate is expected to suffer significant variations: 1– 41 termi- nals in a 30 km radius.  The study of the LTE access networks in this scenario, especially as data ser- vice  providers,  takes  on  an  unprecedented  relevance,  as  only  until  recently  tele- communication  service  providers  preferred  rendering  voice  services  via  existing  2G and 3G technologies. Data traffic is at the mercy of the limitations imposed by  the transmission technology used by these generations of cell systems.  Therefore, LTE expansion, in this scenario, is strongly supported by regulatory  initiatives  and  government  policies,  aligned  with  the  progress  reached  globally  with 3GPP standardization of the 450 MHz range as described in the next Section.  2.3   3GPP Standardization  Besides the specific scenario of application in Brazil, 3GPP believes LTE 450 MHz  has the potential to establish itself as a global system and the most adequate option  for the deployment of 4G networks in sparsely populated regions around the world.  One of the greatest challenges to reach this goal consists in the definition of eco- nomically sustainable models, particularly when considering the difficulties related  to the deployment, operation, and maintenance of such networks.  The process for standardizing the 450 MHz band for LTE began in September  2012 [10], in the form of an unprecedented proposal from a Brazilian delegation.    Evaluation of the LTE 450 MHz System Performance …  65  Several challenges related to the channelization of the spectrum, the coexistence  of adjacent services, the transmission and reception performance parameters, and  the standardization of test methodologies and procedures had to be overcome. The  process  took  into  account  the  Brazilian  scenario,  characterized  by  particularities  regarding the regulation of the spectrum, not only that allocated for LTE use, but  for adjacent services as well. However, the approach used in the specification did  not limit itself to a specific scenario, but considered, for example, terminal mobil- ity.  In  these  conditions,  band  31  became  part  of  the  standard  in  mid-2013  [1],  becoming a decisive and motivating factor to encourage Brazilian service provid- ers and manufacturers to invest in products and solutions based on LTE systems  operating in the 450 MHz range.  Based on this scenario, a system-based analysis of the performance for differ-  ent terminal antennas types is presented below.  3   Evaluation Scenario  The scenario in question was evaluated by simulation, based on the LTE-Sim simu- lator [11], available as open source on the Internet. This simulator has been used in  diverse situations, with results considered significant, as attested by Boggia et al.  [12],  Camarda  et  al.  [13],  Capozzi  et  al.  [14],  Grieco  et  al.  [15],  and  Piro  et  al.  [16]. The software simulates the transmission of resource blocks  RB , in compli- ance with LTE technology. It additionally offers the following features: direct and  reverse link transmission, several types of schedulers and traffic generators, multi- ple cell treatment, interference calculation, customization of propagation models,  generation of random cell terminal distribution, and mobility model selection.  However, the software does not provide the resources needed to evaluate condi- tions  compatible  with  the  preferred  scenario  for  450  MHz  range  utilization. The  authors therefore decided to include the following functionalities in the simulator:   a   treatment for interference for directional antennas, with equations described in   Sect. 3.1;   b   a propagation model, mentioned in Sect. 3.2;  c   the generation of random coordinates of terminal locations, according to the   distribution, either Uniform or Gaussian, as described in Sect. 3.3.  This section also presents the disposition of cells and base transceiver stations, as  well as the simulator configuration parameters.  3.1   Terminal Antennas  In  the  priority  scenario,  proposed  for  analyzing  the  LTE  450  MHz  system  per- formance,  the  terminals   User  Equipment—UE   are  considered  fixed  equipment.

Bazzo and P. Cardieri  evaluated alternatively. The gain and front-to-back ratio  FTBR , when applicable,  of these antennas varies and certain metrics for system performance measurement  are calculated, to single out the antennas settings with the best performance.  In Table 2, the electrical characteristics of the antennas are presented. In par- ticular,  the  gain,  the −3  dB  beam  width  in  the  horizontal  plane   azimuth  plane  Φ−3dB and the front-to-back ratio of the radiators are specified. These characteris- tics are based on commercial Yagi–Uda antenna performance specifications [17];  in other words, the analyzed scenarios depicted real conditions. Furthermore, gain  variations are linked to variations in the −3 dB beam width in the horizontal plane. To represent the gain radiation pattern in the horizontal plane of the terminal,  the following expression was used  3GPP, 2013a :  GH  φ  = G − min cid:31 12 cid:30  φ  φ−3dB cid:29 2  , FTBR cid:28   dBi ,   1   where  G  indicates  the  antenna  gain  in  dBi,  Φ−3dB  its  −3  dB  beam  width  in  the  horizontal  plane  in  degrees,  FTBR  its  front-to-back  ratio  in  dB,  and  −180  ≤ Φ < 180 . This equation is widely used in studies to assess system-based  performance  [18],  since  it  is  a  faithful  representation  of  the  azimuth  pattern  in  directional antennas.  Figures 1, 2, and 3 below present the radiation patterns related with antennas   1, 2, and 3, described in Table 2.  Still on the subject of the antennas used to evaluate performance, the existence  of polarization mismatch was not taken into consideration, due to the propagation  environment  and  the  antenna  mounting  alignment,  nor  was  the  impedance  mis- match with feeder system, since commercial antennas dedicated for use in termi- nals display return loss better than 10 dB in the operating band.  Having defined the antennas, the next section will evaluate the suitable propa- gation model, taking into account the frequency, climate, antenna height, and other  parameters.  3.2   Propagation Model  The UHF band propagation model was derived from the method recommended for  point-to-area coverage prediction in the 30–3000 MHz range by the International  Telecommunication Union [19].

However, the field value received informed in the ITU document was obtained  from the measurement of a half-wave dipole in a transmitting station with effective  radiated power of 1 kW. Thus, the effectively isotropic radiated power  EIRP  cor- responds to 62.15 dBm.  To calculate loss by propagation, the power received by a matched load coupled  with  the  receiving  antenna  must  first  be  determined.  Considering  that  the  power  level  Pr,  delivered  to  the  matched  load  connected  to  the  receiving  antenna  with  gain Gr, matched in polarization with an incident wave with electric field intensity  EμV m and frequency fMHz, is expressed by:  Pr = −77, 2 + EµV m − 20 log fMHz  + Gr  dBm ,   2  then, based on the data [19], the power received at distances between 1 and 50 km  from the transmitting antenna was determined.  Once  the  received  power  had  been  established  and  knowing  the  transmission  power, the loss by propagation between the antennas was calculated. The equation  expressing the propagation loss was determined by non-linear regression, as pre- sented in Fig. 4, with a coefficient of 98.5 %.

The terminals’ geography distribution for a rural area can follow different pat-  3.3   Distribution of the Terminals  The terminals were distributed in seven cells, as shown in Fig. 5. In this configura- tion, the base stations are located in the center of the cells.  The  terminal  stations  were  laid  out  in  each  cell  according  to  the  following   distributions:  	 Uniform: this distribution is commonly used in urban environment simulation,   but is not the most adequate for rural environments.   	 Gaussian: although there are no references indicating that rural homes are laid  out according to this distribution, it was adopted with the assumption that it is  the most adequate for evaluating system performance in a rural environment. In  fact,  this  application  scenario  typically  features  a  greater  concentration  of  ter- minals in the central region of the cell, where the radio base station is usually  installed. In this project, a standard deviation of σ = 12 was considered, imply- ing that 95.2 % of the terminals are located between 1 and 24 km from the radio  base station. This interval encompasses a small county with a population under  100,000 and large extensions of land, such as those typically found in the north  and  middle-western  regions  of  Brazil.  There  is  no  reference  of  an  adequate  value for this standard deviation, thanks to the great diversity of the 5000-plus  Brazilian counties in terms of population, territory, and housing characteristics   rural and urban . A study of the different configurations of this distribution can  be carried out in future projects.   70  J.J. Bazzo and P. Cardieri  Fig. 5   Simulation scenario with seven cells  Fig. 6   Terminals laid out in: a Uniform distribution; b Gaussian distribution  Figure  6  illustrates  the  layout  of  the  terminals,  in  Uniform  and  Gaussian  distri- bution.  In  each  figure,  the  locations  of  the  900  terminals  are  marked.  The  total  number of locations is the result of 30 terminals considered in each one of the 30  simulation runs used to achieve the results.  The possibility of using terminals with mobility was not considered, since the  long distances defined by the coverage requirements to be met by the service pro- viders and the power limits imposed by the ANATEL resolution [7] do not favor  the use of this kind of terminal.   Evaluation of the LTE 450 MHz System Performance …  71  The  transmission  power  and  base  transceiver  station  antenna  gain  consid- ered  are  compliant  with  the  maximum  values  allowed  by  ANATEL  Resolution  558 2010  2010 .  The simulation settings are detailed below based on the considerations exposed   in the previous sections.  3.4   Simulator Settings  The basic configuration of the simulator used to characterize the analyzed scenar- ios is described in Table 3.  The  adopted  operation  mode  is  Single-Input  Single-Output   SISO ,  since  the  simulator  only  supports  such  transmission  mode.  The  data  rate  can  be  adjusted  according to a multiplexing gain in order to estimate the performance with Multi- Input Multi-Output  MIMO .  As  stated  previously,  the  simulations  were  run  for  the  direct  link  and,  to  this  end, terminal reception noise was determined and used to evaluate signal to inter- ference plus noise ratio  SINR  throughout the cell.  Thermal noise per resource block  RB  was calculated at −121.4 dBm. Using  a noise figure  NF  of 9 dB in the terminal receiver and 10 dB white noise in the  cell,  above  thermal  noise,  terminal  reception  noise  was  determined  to  be −109  dBm per RB. These  SINR  values  are  used  as  input  parameters  for  the  adaptive  modulation   mechanism implemented in the simulator.  It was presumed that all terminal antennas were correctly installed, so that the  radiation pattern would be pointed toward the Base Station  BS  in the direction  ensuring the highest gain.  Losses by penetration were not taken into consideration, based on the assump- tion  that  the  antennas  were  installed  in  outdoor  environments,  several  meters  above the ground.  The  cell  radius  was  set  at  30  km,  covered  by  the  service  associated  with  the  respective authorization for the use of radio frequency in the sub-range, in accord- ance with Decree No. 7512 [20], regulating the 450 MHz range, which establishes  this coverage radius as a reference for minimum geographical range commitments  to be met by service providers acquiring the rights to use this range.  It was presumed that the terminals were located farther than 1 km from the BS,  since even in small cities, the central cell region is considered urban area, and will  very likely be serviced by systems operating in higher frequencies. A best effort  traffic generator was used, that is, non-stop transmission in the direct link for all  active terminals  Radio Resource Control—RRC .  The  following  section  lists  the  performance  results  for  all  scenarios  defined  according to the premises presented in this section, with varied terminal antenna  types, parameters, and layouts.   72  Table 3   Simulation  parameters  J.J.

This throughput  is the chosen parameter for validating the influence of using antennas with differ- ent characteristics on the terminals distributed in the analyzed cell.   Evaluation of the LTE 450 MHz System Performance …  73  Figure 7 shows the average throughput simulations in different positions in the   central cell for the various scenarios indicated in the figure  scenarios 1–4 .  The antennas used are those described in Table 2 and identified in the captions   of Fig. 7. The legends use T  N, G  to mean the following:  	 T: “D” or “O” for directional or omnidirectional antennas, respectively.  	 N: Number of cells.  	 G: Antenna gain.  In cases of distance of 2.5 km and lower, although they are not presented in the  chart,  the  resulting  throughput  is  the  same  for  all  scenarios,  even  for  those  with  interference  and  an  omnidirectional  antenna  O N,  G  =  7.8. This  is  because  the  SINR in this region favors the selection of the highest level modulation, even if the  least robust, for all scenarios, thus resulting in a greater throughput.  The  purpose  of  the  comparison  between  scenarios  1  and  4  is  to  assess  the  gain resulting from the use of directional antennas instead of an omnidirectional  antenna with the same gain, assuming that the number of cells in the system is the  same.  Results  prove  that  the  absolute  advantage  achieved  by  using  a  directional  antenna  is  practically  constant  throughout  the  cell. This  is  explained  by  the  fact  that this antenna is able to minimize interfering signals originating from neighbor- ing  cells  because  of  the  width  of  its  beam  in  the  horizontal  plane  and  its  front– back ratio.  The purpose of the comparison between scenarios 3 and 4 is to assess how  interference affects throughput. As expected, the greatest degradation occurs at the  edge of the cell, where, as indicated in Fig. 8, the terminal is located in the least  favorable position, resulting in a reduction in performance by a factor of 10. This  reduction becomes smaller as the terminal approaches the BS.  Fig. 7   Average central cell  throughput for different  distances from the base  transceiver station   74  J.J. Bazzo and P. Cardieri  Fig. 8   Three greatest  interfering signals affecting a  terminal located at the edge  of the central cell  The  purpose  of  the  comparison  between  scenarios  1  and  2  was  to  evaluate  the performance for the same number of interfering BSs, however, with different  antennas’ gains. The front–back ratio in both scenarios is the same. The achieved  results  quantify  the  improvement  of  system  performance  based  on  parameters  assembled from real antennas; the authors thus avoided extreme variations of the  parameters, which would result in assessments diverging from reality. It was deter- mined that the greatest gain in performance was achieved at the edge of the cell,  since  in  this  region,  the  antenna  suffers  discrimination  regarding  the  directions  associated with the two greatest interfering signals.  The  achieved  results  quantify  the  improvement  of  system  performance  based  on  parameters  assembled  from  real  antennas;  the  authors  thus  avoided  extreme  variations  of  the  parameters,  which  would  result  in  assessments  diverging  from  reality. It was determined that the greatest gain in performance was achieved at the  edge of the cell, since in this region, the antenna suffers discrimination regarding  the directions associated with the two greatest interfering signals.  This  discrimination  is  associated  with  the  front–back  ratio,  with  a  value  of  15 dB for both antennas, as shown in Table 2. In this case, the antenna aperture,  different than that used for scenarios 1 and 4, does not contribute to minimize  the interference, leaving the task of increasing antenna gain to SINR improvement,  which causes the resulting gain in throughput.  The  comparison  of  scenario  1  with  scenario  4,  considering  the  use  of  Gaussian distribution, produced a 14 % gain in performance, thanks to the use of  a  directional  antenna  with  the  same  gain  as  that  of  an  omnidirectional  antenna.    Evaluation of the LTE 450 MHz System Performance …  75  Fig. 9   Average cell throughput for different user distributions and antenna characteristics  Since most terminals are located in the central region of the cell, the loss of per- formance  caused  by  interferences  and  by  the  use  of  an  omnidirectional  antenna  becomes  less  relevant  when  using  Gaussian  distribution  and  comparing  it  with  Uniform  distribution.  In  the  latter  case,  loss  is  approximately  90  %.  Figure  9  shows absolute average central cell throughput.  The  comparison  of  scenario  3  with  scenario  4  revealed  a  25  %  gain  in  throughput  when  using  Gaussian  distribution,  and  approximately  100  %  for  Uniform distribution. This is due to the fact that when using Uniform distribution,  there  are  a  greater  number  of  terminals  at  the  edge  of  the  cell,  which  are  more  susceptible  to  interference  originating  from  neighboring  cells.  This  explains  the  greater  degradation  in  the  scenario  with  Uniform  distribution  compared  to  that  observed with Gaussian distribution.  For scenarios 1 and 2, with Gaussian distribution, a relative gain of approxi- mately 20 % is achieved when using an antenna with more gain. In this case, aver- age terminal throughput increases from 300 to 360 kbps for a 30-km radius cell.  Based on the results presented, the conclusions are described as follows.  5   Conclusion  This  chapter  evaluated  the  scenario  for  using  LTE  technology  for  the  450  MHz  frequency  based  on  ANATEL  resolutions,  4G  auction  requirements  in  Brazil,  3GPP norms, and the characteristics of commercial terminal antennas, as well as  the geographic distribution of homes in the rural area.   76  J.J. Bazzo and P. Cardieri  Cell  throughput  was  evaluated  in  the  direct  link  for  both  omnidirectional  and  directional antennas, using a system-based simulator, configured for operation in  the rural scenario, with and without the presence of other interfering cells.  In  scenarios  with  interference,  there  was  a  14–19  %  increase  in  the  through- put of terminals operating with directional antennas, compared with a directional  antenna of the same gain with Gaussian and Uniform distribution of the terminal  in the cell’s geographic area.  The 4 dB increase of gain of the directional antenna and the resulting narrow- ing of the beam caused a 20 and 25 % increase in throughput for the Gaussian and  Uniform terminal layouts, respectively.  The absence of interfering factors improved throughput between 25 and 92 %   when using the same omnidirectional antenna and different terminal layouts.  It was also determined that when using an omnidirectional antenna, the perfor- mance of terminals located at the edge of the cell was severely damaged, almost  ten  times  worse  than  when  using  a  directional  antenna  with  the  same  gain.  The  disparity in the terminal throughput over the cell increases with the use of omnidi- rectional antenna.  This work will help the operators to choose the best terminal antenna, improv- ing system performance and meeting the 450 MHz spectrum auction requirements.  Terminal manufacturers can create product segments with varied antenna character- istics to bring service providers the appropriate solution for the different cell regions. The  next  section  presents  suggestions  for  future  research  projects  that  will   bring improvements to this area.  6   Future projects  The evolution of this project must assess performance in other scenarios and con- figurations that were not broached in this chapter—for example, the evaluation of  performance in the reverse channel, especially for terminals located in the edge of  the  cell,  the  assessment  of  the  level  of  equity  of  performance  between  terminals  and the configuration of scenarios with frequency reuse and sector coverage.

However,  analyses  found  in  the  literature  often  model the signal of interest as a generic transport channel whose subcarriers con- vey information of the same kind.

The effects of NBI manifest themselves as  a wideband receiver within the coverage area of a narrowband transmitter does not  pick up the noisy signals of interest  SOI , but a sum of SOI, narrowband signals  and  noise  instead.  Depending  on  the  transmit  power  of  the  narrowband  system,  the undesired components present in the sum signal may introduce nonlinear dis- tortions  in  the  automatic  gain  control  and  analog-to-digital  conversion  blocks  of  the wideband receiver. This is a well-understood issue, and ways to tackle it are  known for NBI of both non-intentional nature [1–6], and intentional nature, e.g.,  jamming in military communications [7, 8].  Narrowband  systems  may  be  found  operating  in  frequencies  designated  for  Long Term Evolution  LTE  systems, especially in bands where legacy  non-LTE   systems are in the process of being refarmed. Up until the point where spectrum  refarming is complete, however, there is a need for LTE and narrowband systems  to coexist. In order to characterize the NBI a LTE system may be subject to, we  carried out in [9] field measurements in the 450–470 MHz range. The reason why  we have chosen these frequencies is twofold. The first reason has its roots in the  Brazilian  National  Broadband  Plan   BNBP ,  which  in  May  2010  advanced  the  use  of  the  225–470  MHz  range  to  accommodate  new  broadband  services  [10].  BNBP’s  goal  is  to  increase  the  penetration  rates  of  broadband  services,  espe- cially in the countryside and remote areas where a significant number  ≈30 mil- lions  of Brazilians live. Later in the same year, the Brazilian Regulatory Agency   ANATEL   allocated  the  451–458  MHz  and  461–468  MHz  bands  as  uplink  and  downlink, respectively, for fixed and mobile radio services operating in frequency  division duplex mode [11].  The  second  reason  relates  to  the  standardization  of  the  450  MHz  band,  des- ignated  as  Band  31,  by  the  Third  Generation  Partnership  Project   3GPP   [12].  3GPP’s aim is to benefit from the superior propagation characteristics of lower fre- quencies in a new LTE profile for fourth generation systems operating in sparsely  populated  areas.  On  behalf  of  the  Brazilian  Ministry  of  Communications,  CPqD  supported 3GPP in the determination of appropriate channelization schemes, coex- istence solutions, and transceiver radio parameters. These specifications will soon  become available as part of LTE Release 12.  In  what  follows,  we  reproduce  some  findings  of  our  measurement  campaign  reported  in  [9]. These  will  help  motivating  for  the  matter  of  NBI  suppression  in  LTE networks, as well as for the work developed in the present chapter.   Wavelet-Based Narrowband Interference Suppression …  81  1.1   Characterization of NBI Sources and Signals  In  Brazil,  the  Band  31  is  predominantly  assigned  to  voice  services,  whose   channels are 12.5 kHz wide. The resolution of the spectrum analyzer was there- fore set to 3 kHz, for 5 MHz  SOI  segments, and 0.3 kHz, for 12.5 kHz  NBI   segments. The  antenna  selected  for  the  measurements  was  a  custom-built  J-pole  antenna  made  of  15  mm  copper  tubes. A  laptop  running  the  software  LabView  allowed sample processing and storage to be carried out in an automated fashion.  In the discussion that follows, we analyze the findings obtained using this setup in  a measurement campaign carried out in Campinas, São Paulo. The exact measure- ment  site  coordinates  and  height  above  the  terrain  were  22º54′  S  47º02′ W  and  667 m, respectively. A picture of our setup is shown in Fig. 1.  An  analysis  of  the  cumulative  distribution  function   CDF   of  received  power  per segment revealed that, for most segments, the NBI power lies below the noise  floor   due  to  the  typically  higher  sensitivity  of  narrowband  radios .  However,  high-power NBI −65 dBm and above  was found sitting at f1 = 463.5500 MHz,  f2 = 464.6000 MHz, f3 = 457.5375 MHz, and f4 = 469.1625 MHz. According to  [13], a search tool publicly made available by ANATEL, the first three frequencies   Fig. 1   Site information and setup used in the measurements   82  J.P. Miranda et al.  are  granted  to  push-to-talk   PTT   systems  used  for  highway  control  and  oil  and  gas  purposes.  The  fourth  one  is  granted  to  the  city  town  of  Campinas  for  data  transmissions. Another CDF analysis, now in terms of talk time, showed that PTT  communications last up to 20 s for 90 % of the cases. The segment occupation was  also found to lie around 30 % on average, for PTT signals, and 100 % of the time,  for data signals.  Our measurements confirmed the presence of multiple narrowband systems in  both  uplink  and  downlink  frequencies  designated  for  the  operation  of  LTE  450  MHz  systems.  Building  on  these  findings,  we  can  set  requirements  for  NBI  suppression so as to ascertain coexistence between LTE and narrowband systems.1  Before we proceed, note that f4 is about ten physical resource blocks  PRB  away  from the LTE subcarrier conveyed by the highest frequency in the downlink. This  is far enough for the corresponding data-based narrowband signals not to interfere  with  the  LTE  system.  NBI  suppression  in  the  uplink  is  out  of  the  scope  of  this  chapter,2 so the PTT-based narrowband signals sitting at f3 will not be taken into  consideration.  1.2   Motivation  Figure 2 depicts an exemplary shot of the signals received in the LTE downlink  during  our  measurements.  The  narrowband  signals  x1   @f1 =  463.5500  MHz   and x2  @f2 = 464.6000 MHz  overlap different portions of the received LTE sig- nal r. x1 mainly affects data on the user plane, i.e., the physical downlink shared  channels  PDSCH , whereas x2 mainly affects control plane information. In par- ticular,  x2  has  potential  to  disrupt  the  Zadoff–Chu  sequences  conveying  symbol  timing and frequency offsets in the primary synchronization channels  PSCH . If  so  the  LTE  receiver  fails  to  get  time  synchronized  with  the  system,  thus  mak- ing it hard to extract frame timing and cell identity information transmitted in the  secondary  synchronization  channels   SSCH . The  lack  of  aforementioned  infor- mation prevents the correct access on the part of the LTE receiver to basic opera- tion parameters, e.g., channel bandwidth, cyclic prefix  CP  length, and antenna  mode, transmitted in the physical broadcast channels  PBCH . As a consequence,  the cell search procedure gets compromised and the receiver cannot register with  the cell [14].  1Although  such  need  for  coexistence  is  clear  in  the  context  considered  here,  it  may  well  be   justified  also  in  any  other  bands  and or  locations  where  legacy   non-LTE   systems  are  in  the   process of being refarmed. 2Our  field  measurements  suggest  that  the  impact  of  NBI  is  more  detrimental  in  the  downlink  because of its potential to cause the user terminal to lose connectivity with the base station, as  explained later. An uplink analysis along the same lines used here should be straightforward to  obtain.   Wavelet-Based Narrowband Interference Suppression …  83  Fig. 2   Exemplary scenario of NBI in the LTE downlink. The signals x1 and x2 are real-world  narrowband signals found in the Band 31. The signal xi is an artificially created narrowband sig- nal that introduces controlled NBI  It  becomes  evident  from  the  above  example  that  the  analysis  of  NBI   and  approaches  to  alleviate  its  deteriorating  effects  in  the  system  performance   calls  for  modeling  that  takes  physical  channels  into  consideration.  However,  the  lit- erature  on  NBI  has  not  managed  so  far  to  address  this  aspect,  as  most  analyses  typically rely on the assumption of a generic transport channel where all SOI sub- carriers  convey  information  of  the  same  kind  [1–8].  In  answer  to  this  need,  we  presented in [9] a standard-compliant assessment of the NBI suppression perfor- mance of some promising time–frequency distributions  TFDs . Among the TFDs  evaluated therein, Daubechies wavelets were shown to offer the best compromise  in  terms  of  complexity  and  signal  distortion  regardless  of  the  type  of  physical  channel.  1.3   Contributions of This Chapter  Having confirmed the candidacy of wavelets as an adequate tool to mitigate NBI in  LTE physical channels in our previous work, in this chapter we extend the analysis    84  J.P. Miranda et al.  to different wavelet types and operation conditions. Here, Biorthogonal, Coiflets, and  Haar wavelets are evaluated in addition to Daubechies with respect to their ability  to suppress NBI in the LTE downlink. It turns out from our simulation work that an  optimized suppression process calls for different wavelet types, the choice of which  being  dependent  on  the  physical  channel  considered.  Daubechies  are  shown  to  be  most convenient for synchronization channels  PSCH and SSCH , while Coiflets are  found to be the best option when it comes to data shared channels  PDSCH .  The  remainder  of  the  chapter  is  organized  as  follows.  Sect.  2  introduces  the  system  model  used  throughout  the  chapter,  overviews  the  fundamentals  of  any  NBI  suppression  process,  and  reviews  a  number  of  different  techniques  that  can  be used to mitigate the problem we have at hand. For the sake of self-containment,  Sect. 3 reproduces part of our previous work in [9]. This will prove to be of utmost  importance as justification to our choice of further investigating wavelets, which  in turn are explained in greater detail in Sect. 4. Simulation results are presented  in  this  section,  and  the  major  contributions  of  the  chapter  are  also  discussed.  Concluding remarks are offered in Sect. 5.  2   Fundamentals of NBI Suppression  This  section  is  split  into  three  parts  that  are  as  follows.  First,  we  put  in  place  a  general system model that can be specialized so as to ease the identification and  removal of NBI coefficients over different signal domains. In the second part, we  provide a brief explanation of a few generic steps common to most NBI suppres- sion  techniques.  A  discussion  about  frequency-domain  techniques,  time-domain  techniques,  and  techniques  able  to  suppress  NBI  in  both  frequency  and  time  domains, along with their strengths and weaknesses, is object of the third part.  2.1   General System Model  Let NS denote the number of subcarriers, Cf e  the complex constellation transmit- ted by the eth subcarrier during the fth symbol, Δf the subcarrier spacing, TCP the  CP length, and TS the sampling period. The LTE downlink Orthogonal Frequency- Division Multiplexing  OFDM  signal conveyed by the fth symbol is given by  s t  =  Cf  e  exp  j2π  fe t − TCPTS  ,   1   ⌈Ns 2⌉   cid:31 e=−⌊Ns 2⌋  with  a  PRB  formed  by  grouping  F  consecutive  symbols  into  a  block  of  E  con- secutive subcarriers, and Cf 0  = 0. Resource grid, physical signals and channels  are  then  generated  in  detailed  accordance  to  the  standard  [15].  In  what  follows,  by abuse of notation, we shall refer to  1  as the SOI associated with a generic but  standard-compliant LTE physical channel.   Wavelet-Based Narrowband Interference Suppression …  85  Suppose the SOI now becomes corrupted by i = 0, 1, …, I narrowband signals.  The  NBI  sources  statistically  relevant  in  terms  of  transmit  power  and  talk  time  were shown in [9] to be PTT radios in the case of the Band 31. The signals trans- mitted within such systems can be assumed, without loss of generality, based on  frequency modulation  FM . Under this assumption, the FM signal transmitted by  the ith NBI source can be written as  xi t  = Ai cos  2π fit + 2π fdev  t  ˆ  0  ai u du + θi ,   2   where Ai, fi, and fdev are the magnitude, center frequency, and frequency deviation  of the carrier used to modulate the audio signal ai, and the random phase θi is uni- formly distributed in the interval  0, 2π .  After being passed through a multipath fading channel with impulse response  h and L taps, the signal picked up by the LTE receiver  assumed not desensitized   corresponds to the SOI plus a sum of NBI contributions  z[n] =r [n] +  yi [n] + w[n],   3   where r[n] and yi[n] are filtered versions of  1  and  2 , i.e.,  I   cid:31 i=0  L−1   cid:31 l=0  L−1   cid:31 l=0  r [n] =  h[l]s[n − σl ]  yi [n] =  h′  [l]xi [n − σl ],  σl is the channel delay spread associated with the lth channel tap, and w is addi- tive white Gaussian noise  AWGN  statistically independent from tap to tap. Note  that, in contrast to the static  and probably band specific  NBI scenario discussed  earlier, the narrowband signals in  2  and  3  can be modified in terms of number,  magnitude,  and  position. This  allows  the  different  LTE  downlink  physical  chan- nels  to  be  fully  exercised  in  the  absence  or  presence  of  controlled  NBI,  e.g.,  as  illustrated by the narrowband signal xi in Fig. 2.  2.2   Step-by-Step of a Generic NBI Suppression Process  Most NBI suppression techniques have as their basis some sort of three-step pro- cess. The first step is the decomposition of the received signal z into some trans- form domain where the signal components corresponding to the NBI can be more  easily  identified.  In  case  SOI  and  narrowband  signals  are  distinguishable  in  the    86  J.P. Miranda et al.  Fig. 3   Block diagram of a generic NBI suppression process  selected domain, the components due to the latter can be estimated via maximum  likelihood  ML  [1], linear minimum mean square error  MMSE  [2], or a com- bination  of  compressive  sensing  and  weighted  least  squares  [3]. The  second  and  third steps, respectively, involve the removal of such undesired components, and  the reconstruction of an estimate of z, denoted as  ˆz.  A  generic  representation  of  this  process  can  be  found  in  Fig.  3. The  analysis  block outputs the channel set Zk, k = 0, 1, …, K − 1, which is fed into the sup- pression block. After the narrowband signals yi have been estimated and cancelled  out,  ˆZk, k = 0, 1, …, K − 1, channels are made available for the synthesis block.  This  block  reconstructs  the  noisy  SOI,  thus  bringing  the  solution  back  to  the  original  problem  domain. To  keep  signal  distortion  low,  the  reconstructed  signal  ˆz should provide a good approximation of  3  when I = 0, i.e., as in the no NBI  case.  2.3   Review of NBI Suppression Techniques  In  what  follows,  we  review  some  techniques  regarded  as  promising  in  the  NBI  suppression  literature. Any  of  them  can  theoretically  be  employed  to  specialize  system model and process described earlier in this section. To support selection of  a given technique among those reviewed, the pros and cons associated with each  technique and signal domain where it works are also discussed.  2.3.1   Frequency-Domain Techniques  Frequency-domain techniques, also known as excision approaches, exploit the fact  that NBI often comes into play in the form of high-power signals that can be dis- tinguished  from  lower-power  SOI  in  the  frequency  domain.  Robustness  against  narrowband signals with center frequencies that change over time, and frequency- selective  fading  are  among  their  advantages.  However,  when  the  NBI  spectra  do  not  sit  at  frequencies  coinciding  with  the  bins  of  the  discrete-time  Fourier    Wavelet-Based Narrowband Interference Suppression …  87  transform   DFT ,  carried  out  at  the  demodulator,  spectral  leakage  occurs.  The  higher  the  NBI  power,  the  larger  the  number  of  corrupted  subcarriers  in  ˆz.  This  issue  can  be  circumvented  by  mapping  the  data  only  to  those  subcarriers  whose  powers  exceed  a  given  signal-to-interference  ratio  [4],  but  the  resulting  system  may fail to comply with currently DFT-based wireless standards.  2.3.2   Time-Domain Techniques  Techniques  that  operate  in  the  time  domain  avoid  spectral  leakage  by  applying  cancellation  filters  before  the  DFT  block.  Time-domain  cancellers  require  less  prior  knowledge  to  work  than  their  frequency-domain  counterparts,  e.g.,  only  estimates of the frequencies where the NBI spectrum sits at and or its power per  subcarrier. As for the limitations, performance may deteriorate in the presence of  frequency offsets. This is exactly the case with phase-locked loops [5], which may  undergo  a  further  drop  in  performance  if  quadrature  phase  shift  keying   QPSK   is  in  use.  Care  must  also  be  taken  when  it  comes  to  filter  design,  as  impulse  responses longer than the CP length introduce intersymbol interference  ISI .  2.3.3   Bidimensional Techniques  In  general,  NBI  suppression  in  frequency  and  time  domains  offer  flexibility  and  resolution superior to those obtained in a single domain. Wavelet transforms [6],  multirate digital filter banks  MDFBs  [7], and bilinear signal distributions [8] are  TFDs that offer relatively lower complexity and near-perfect signal reconstruction  at  the  expense  of  none  or  very  few  prior  knowledge  of  the  systems  and  signals  causing  NBI.  Another  advantage  is  that,  by  directly  representing  the  frequency  content of the signal while keeping the time description parameter, the linear pro- gression  of  the  frequency  with  time  can  be  observed  [16].  However,  despite  its  potential for robustness against NBI, the application of TFDs has been limited to  spectrally spread systems [6–8] and a better understanding is needed in the context  of multicarrier wideband systems.  2.3.4   Discussion  In  light  of  the  literature  review  above,  we  can  conclude  that  candidate  solutions  for NBI suppression in the LTE systems operating in the Band 31  or in any other  spectra where the conditions for coexistence with narrowband systems are similar  to those determined here  should be designed bearing the following requirements  in mind:  	 Low signal distortion: LTE operation occurs most of the time  up to 70 %  in  the absence of high-power NBI. Near-perfect signal reconstruction is crucial to  maintain the bit error rate  BER  of the system.   88  J.P. Miranda et al.   	 Prior knowledge: For the sake of flexibility and practical feasibility, the amount  of information known a priori about narrowband signals should be kept as low  as it can possibly be, i.e., blind techniques are preferred.   	 Low  computational  complexity:  Narrowband  systems  currently  found  in  LTE  operation  bands  may  not  be  refarmed  nor  undergo  modifications  of  any  kind  soon. NBI originated from these systems can be suppressed at the receive side,  where low-complex approaches are preferred.  3   Previous Work  In answer to the aforementioned needs, we assessed the NBI suppression perfor- mance  of  Daubechies  wavelets,  a  polyphase  implementation  of  MDFBs,  and  a  custom Wigner–Ville distribution  WVD  aided time-domain canceller [9]. For the  sake of self-containment, we reproduce in the sequel a smaller set of results illus- trating  the  performance  of  such  techniques.  The  underlying  theory  behind  each  of these techniques is briefly discussed here too, except for wavelets to which we  dedicate the entire Sect. 4.  3.1   Multirate Digital Filter Banks  Provided that the Zk channels in Fig. 3 are uniformly and contiguously spaced, and  critically sampled, an efficient option is to decompose z using [7]   Zk [m] =  ¯pρ [r ]zρ [m − r ]W −kρ M ,   4   M−1   cid:31 ρ=0  ∞   cid:31 r=−∞  where  the  sample  index  m  may  differ  from  n,  the  decimation  and  interpolation  ratio M is equal to K,  ¯pρ [m] =h A [mM − ρ ] is the ρth polyphase branch of a low- pass analysis filter hA, r = [n + ρ] M, and WM = exp j2π   M. NBI suppression is carried out along the same lines described later for wave- lets,  i.e.,  by  exploiting  the  prior  knowledge  of  the  center  frequencies  where  nar- rowband signals sit at. Signal reconstruction can be efficiently implemented using  ˆzρ [r ] =  1  M  M−1   cid:31 k=0  ∞   cid:31 m =−∞  qρ [r − m]  ˆZk [m]W  kρ M ,   5   where qρ [m] =h S [mM + ρ ] denotes the  ρth polyphase branch of a lowpass syn- thesis filter hS.  A parallel implementation of sets of filters  ¯pρ and qρ is a polyphase network,  and the polyphase structures in  4  and  5  are known to be mathematically equiv- alent to the banks of lowpass filters and decimators interpolators that would result  from the direct mechanization of analysis and synthesis blocks based on MDFBs.   Wavelet-Based Narrowband Interference Suppression …  89  3.2   Bilinear Signal Distributions  A filter bank is also a special quadratic TFD that represents the signal in a joint  time-frequency domain. Among bilinear TFDs, the representation regarded as the  most powerful and fundamental is the WVD due to the superior covariance prop- erties it possesses.  The discrete-time WVD  DWVD  can be written as [17]  Zk [n] =  z[n + m]z∗  [n − m]w[m]w∗  [−m]W km 4 ,   6   N   cid:31 r =−N  where the window w = 0 for m > N, N an integer, and W4 = exp −j4π K . The  additional power of 2 in W4 is a scaling in frequency that is negligible, so in prac- tice it can be replaced by the standard twiddle factor W2 = exp −j2π K  used in  the DFT.  Different  synthesis  procedures  can  be  employed  to  obtain  the  reconstructed  signal  ˆz  [18],  but  they  are  somewhat  cumbersome  to  implement  in  practice. We  therefore  decided  to  exploit  the  superior  visualization  of  DWVD-based  analysis  in a simple time-domain NBI canceller. Since SOI subcarriers are all transmitted  at the same power level for a given modulation scheme and data traffic, the indi- ces  of  subcarriers  corrupted  by  NBI  can  be  blindly  identified  using  the  DWVD  over  the  entire  received  signal  bandwidth.  Having  confirmed  the  presence  of  in- band  narrowband  signals   which  are  clearly  distinguishable  from  the  SOI  in  the  DWVD domain , we “blank” corrupted subcarriers in the time domain, bringing  their  gains  back  to  the  expected  value.  The  blanking  threshold  used  to  this  end  is computed on the basis of the average standard deviation of the power received  over all subcarriers.  3.3   Simulation Settings and Preliminary Results  In  this  section,  we  discuss  some  preliminary  results  obtained  using  a  custom- built  Matlab  simulator  that  implements  the  LTE  PHY  in  detailed  accordance  to  the  standard  [14,  15].  The  simulation  settings  common  to  all  techniques  and  those  that  are  technique-specific  are  both  summarized  in Table  1. We  conducted  simulations  for  the  cases  ‘NBI  Off’   I =  0 ,  ‘NBI  On’   I =  1  without  suppres- sion ,  and  ‘Technique’,  which  means  that  NBI  is  suppressed  using  the  corre- sponding  technique.  The  latter  two  cases  introduce  NBI  at  f1 =  463.5500  MHz  and f2 = 464.6000 MHz, one frequency at a time, so we can evaluate the impact  on  the  performance  of  PDSCH  and  PSCH SSCH.  The  NBI SOI  power  ratio  is  set  to  15  dB,  which  corresponds  to  the  worst-case  condition  observed  in  our  measurements.  3GPP  has  been  developing  channel  models  for  LTE.  However,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no  standardized   nor  widely  accepted   model  reflecting  LTE    90  J.P.

A suitable alterna- tive is the 6-tap channel model established within the IEEE 802.22 standard [19],  which meets most requirements mandated by [11]  see Table 2 . In the sequel, we  present a smaller set of results obtained using the ‘Profile A’ of the 802.22 chan- nel model. Upon passing through this channel, PTT and LTE signals will undergo  flat and frequency-selective fading, respectively, but both signals will be subject to  less destructive slow fading characteristics. One issue brought about by the choice  of this channel, however, is that the maximum delay spread of 21 μs  see Table 3   cannot be absorbed by the standard CP lengths, TCP = NS TS ≈ 4.69 μs for normal  CP, and TCP = 16.67 μs for extended CP, used in LTE. In this setting, ISI is the  dominating effect and less will likely be seen in terms of NBI suppression regard- less of the CP length used. Nevertheless, and since the simulation is under mul- tipath fading, the CP is set to extended and the modulation to QPSK with code rate  1 3. Antenna mode is SISO, channel estimation is assumed ideal, and equalization  relies  on  MMSE.  5 ×  107  Monte  Carlo  trials  are  carried  out  for  each  signal-to- noise  SNR  point.

This is in good agreement with our expec- tations because the resolution achieved by the 8-level DWT used is about 20 times  finer  than  that  of  the  256-tap  polyphase  implementation,  here  referred  to  simply  as  ‘PolyNets’. While  the  multilevel  DWT  is  capable  of  cancelling  out  NBI  in  a  highly  localized  fashion,  PolyNets  and  our  DWVD-based  approach  act  on  the  entire  SOI  bandwidth.  In  fact,  it  turns  out  that  the  use  of  MDFBs  for  NBI  sup- pression in systems with non-overlapping designs is not advisable, as the attenu- ation  outside  the  filters’  stopband  regions  can  never  be  infinite  in  practice.  This  harms  the  subcarrier  orthogonality  of  OFDM   introducing  signal  distortions ,  thus  explaining  the  poor  performance  of  PolyNets  observed  here.  Despite  being  the best performer, the DWT needs to know the center frequencies where NBI sits  at  in  order  to  suppress  it. The  simple  DWVD-based  approach  proposed  has  also  shown value in some cases, and its application can be considered as a blind alter- native to wavelets when no such prior knowledge is available.  Among  the  TFDs  considered,  Daubechies  are  shown  the  best  compromise  in  terms  of  complexity  and  signal  distortion  regardless  of  the  physical  chan- nel type. A question that remains open so far is whether wavelet types other than  Daubechies can improve performance further, and, if so, what type best suits each  physical channel. This may well be the case since the wavelet choice is dictated by  the signal characteristics  recall the distinct structure of signals conveyed through  different  LTE  physical  channels   and  application  nature.  But  before  we  carry  on  with the selection of candidate wavelets, let us briefly review their theory and look  into efficient ways to implement a practical wavelet-based NBI suppressor.  4   Wavelet-Based NBI Suppression  4.1   The Discrete Wavelet Transform  The idea of the wavelet transform is to project a signal on a family of zero-mean  functions Ψu,v t , u, v integers, deduced from an elementary function Ψ t  by trans- 0t − ut0 .  The  full  representation  of  z  lations  and  dilations,  i.e.,   u,v t  =   av using coefficients of the form [16]  v 2 WTz u, v;    = a 0  z t   ∗  u,vdt   7   +∞  ˆ  −∞   J.P.

Fortunately,  this  limitation  can  be  overcome  by  exploiting  the  close  relationship  of MDFBs with the discrete wavelet transform  DWT . Using the DWT, the imple- mentation of the analysis  synthesis  block in Fig. 3 requires only a pair of low- pass  and  highpass  filters,  whose  outputs  are  both  downsampled   upsampled   by  2.  In  each  scale  obtained  at  the  output  of  the  bank  of  filters,  NBI  is  suppressed  by  cancelling  out  the  coefficients  associated  with  narrowband  components.  The  threshold applied to this end can be set using [6]  √  γ = σ 2 s  2erf−1 Pfa ,  where σ 2 s  is the variance of the SOI and Pfa is the probability of a sample crossing  the threshold  γ in the absence of interference. The multilevel DWT involves the  repetitive application of uniform filter banks on the low-frequency channel, mean- ing that redundancy is introduced more in that channel as compared to the high- frequency channel. In such multilevel settings, finer resolution is achieved but the  recursive coefficient computation raises the need to store intermediate coefficients.  This burden can be avoided by replacing the cascaded lowpass filters and subsam- pling by 2 at each resolution level of the analysis block by an equivalent analysis  filter, defined in the z-domain as [20]:   8    9   H J  A z  =  HA z2j     J−1   cid:31 j=0  An  equivalent  synthesis  filter  H J S  z   can  be  generated  accordingly  to  replace  the  cascaded  highpass  filters  and  upsampling  by  2  used  in  the  synthesis  block.  In  either  case,  the  coefficients  of  the  jth  level  can  now  be  computed  without  prior  knowledge  of  the  coefficients  of  the   j  −  1 th  level.  Such  an  equivalent  filter  implementation of the multilevel DWT is exemplified in Fig. 5 for the case of a  three-level MDFB  J = 3 . In  such  an  implementation,  the  wavelet  type  used  at  each  level  needs  to  be  compactly supported, i.e., so as to allow discrete-time analysis based on the DWT.  Another  requirement,  determined  by  the  application  nature,  is  that  the  wavelet   Fig. 5   Exemplary multilevel wavelet-based NBI suppression process  J = 3    Table 4   Selected candidate wavelets and their characteristics  J.P.

All types considered are  symmetric,  except  for  Coiflets  and  Daubechies  which  are  only  approximately  symmetric and asymmetric, respectively.  4.2   Simulation Work  The  simulator  and  simulation  settings  used  in  this  second  round  of  simulations  are basically the same as described in Sect. 3. The settings common to all simula- tion  campaigns   unless  mentioned  otherwise   and  those  that  are  wavelet-specific  are summarized in Table 5. As before, we consider the cases ‘NBI Off’  I = 0 ,  ‘NBI On’  I = 1 without suppression , and ‘WaveletType’, which means that NBI  is suppressed using the corresponding type of wavelet .

The number of  vanishing  moments  used  within  each  wavelet  type  is  carefully  chosen  by  means  of  small-scale  simulations  so  as  to  produce  the  best  results  for  fixed  resolution   J = 8  and probability of false alarm  Pfa = 0.01 . As many as 5 × 107 Monte  Carlo trials are carried out for each SNR point.  4.2.1   AWGN Channel  In  this  simulation  campaign,  we  assess  the  performance  of  wavelet-based  NBI  suppression in the presence of AWGN. Such an evaluation scenario, where addi- tive noise and NBI are the sole mechanisms at work, will be used as benchmark  later on to help us determine the impact of fading in the NBI suppression process.  Results are given in Fig. 6, where the use of different wavelet types across differ- ent LTE physical channels yields to improved suppression results. Haar wavelets  are  not  recommended  for  PDSCH  because,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6a,  they  introduce  performance  losses  with  respect  to  the  ‘NBI  On’  case.  Coiflets,  in  contrast,  are  clearly  the  best  option,  with  performance  matching  that  of  the  ‘NBI  Off’  case.  Thanks  to  the  robustness  of  the  Zadoff–Chu  sequences  conveyed  in  the  PSCH,  both  Daubechies  and  Biorthogonal  wavelets  match  the  ‘NBI  Off’  case  perfor- mance in Fig. 6b also with no single error measured. While this is not the case in  Fig. 6c, due to the weaker pseudo-random sequences conveyed in SSCH, Coiflets  again outperform all other wavelet types considered.  4.2.2   Flat Fading Channel  A  second  simulation  campaign  was  carried  out  to  determine  the  performance  derived when the received signal is subjected to flat fading, i.e., all of its frequen- cies are equally affected by the channel. The corresponding results are shown in  Fig. 7, where we again see that different performances can be derived by employ- ing different wavelets. In Fig. 7a, Daubechies and Coiflets give similar results for  PDSCH until SNR of about 10 dB, with the latter becoming better than the former  from that point on. Figure 7b shows that all the types of wavelets but Daubechies  perform  approximately  same.  Daubechies  offer  gains  of  up  to  20  dB  over  the  ‘NBI On’ case, thus having their selection justified for PSCH. A similar behavior  is  observed  in  Fig.  7c,  where  Coiflets  also  prove  to  be  an  interesting  option  for  SSCH provided that the SNR is high enough.  4.2.3   Frequency-Selective Channel  In this simulation campaign, we again consider the ‘Profile A’ of the 802.22 chan- nel model with profile given in Table 3. However, in order to circumvent the limi- tation experienced in our first simulation round, thus allowing the LTE system to    96  Fig. 6   NBI suppression  performance obtained over  LTE physical channels using  different wavelet types in the  presence of AWGN only  J.P.

Nevertheless,  the  benefit  of  NBI  suppression can only be better visualized when ideal channel estimation is used.  Under  this  assumption,  Fig.  8a  suggests  that  any  type  of  wavelet  chosen  among    Wavelet-Based Narrowband Interference Suppression …  99  the  candidates  considered  outperforms  the  ‘NBI  On’  case  in  excess  of  5  dB.  Apparently,  and  unlike  the  results  just  discussed  for  PDSCH,  the  assumption  of  ideal  channel  estimation  seems  to  play  a  less  critical  role  for  synchronization  channels.  This  is  seen  for  PSCH  and  SSCH  in  Fig.  8b,  c,  respectively,  whose  curves are roughly same as those obtained using MMSE channel estimation  not  shown in the figures .  4.3   Discussion  Table  6  summarizes  the  results  of  all  simulation  campaigns  carried  out  in  this  chapter. One conclusion drawn from this table is that the optimization of the NBI  suppression process across the LTE physical channels calls for different types of  wavelets. The use of Coiflets has proven most suitable for cancelling out narrow- band signals in the user plan, characterized in terms of PDSCH here. Daubechies  have  been  shown  as  the  best  option  when  it  comes  to  NBI  in  the  control  plane,  especially  in  PSCH. As  for  SSCH,  either  Coiflets  or  Daubechies  can  be  applied  thanks to their similar suppression performances.  Besides having determined the matches among physical channels and wavelet  types that offer the best NBI suppression results for LTE systems, this chapter has  illustrated  the  extent  to  which  the  wavelet-based  approach  depends  on  the  wire- less  channel  considered.  In  fact,  our  simulation  work  suggests  that  choosing  the  “right match” yields to ideal performance under AWGN for most physical chan- nels. However, the performance losses  with respect to the ideal ‘NBI Off’ case   progressively  increase  as  more  realistic  operation  conditions  such  as  shadowing  and multipath fading are taken into consideration. This is in good agreement with  our expectations, as multiplicative mechanisms create oscillations in the received  power level whose contributions have potential to dominate the contribution due  to NBI. In this case, the performances observed for scenarios ‘NBI Off’ and ‘NBI  On’ become so close to each other that the gains derived by using wavelets dra- matically decrease.  We  believe  that  these  results  are,  in  part,  due  to  the  ability  to  reject  frequen- cies  out  of  the  band  of  interest,  and  complementarity  of  the  quadrature  mirror  filters  QMF  pair used in the analysis and synthesis blocks. As shown in Fig. 9,  Bior9.3 and Haar QMF pairs are, respectively, the least complementary and weak- est  in  terms  of  out-of-band  attenuation.  In  contrast,  Coif-5  and  Daub-8  are  the   Table 6   Summary of simulation results Channel type AWGN Flat fading  PDSCH Coif-5 Coif-5  PSCH Bior9.3, Daub-8 Daub-8  Frequency-selective fading  Coif-5  Daub-8  SSCH Coif-5 Coif-5,  Daub-8 Coif-5,  Daub-8   100   a    c   J.P.

However, recalling that the wavelet  choice tightly relates to the SOI, and symmetry  or asymmetry, as in Coiflets and  Daubechies   may  also  play  a  role  in  the  NBI  suppression  process,  in  our  future  work  we  will  deepen  the  study  by  looking  into  the  structures  of  QPSK  signals,  Zadoff–Chu  sequences  and  pseudo-random  sequences,  respectively,  conveyed  through PDSCH, PSCH, and SSCH.  5   Concluding Remarks  This chapter has described a wavelet-based approach aimed at mitigating NBI in  LTE  physical  channels.

For  downlink  data  transmission  in  LTE  systems,  the  Base  Station  usually  selects  modulation  scheme  and  code  rate  depending  on  the prediction of the downlink channel conditions. A piece of information crucial  to this selection process is the feedback from the Channel Quality Indicator  CQI   transmitted by the User Equipment  UE  in the uplink channel. For uplink trans- missions  in  LTE  systems,  the  link  adaptation  process  is  similar  to  the  downlink  process, with the Base Station handling the selection of the modulation and coding  scheme  MCS .  1   Introduction  The principle of link adaptation is essential for the development of a radio inter- face  project  for  efficient  packet  switching  data  traffic  [1,  2].  Link  adaptation  in  Long  Term  Evolution   LTE   systems  dynamically  adjusts  the  data  rate  of  trans- mitted  information   modulation  scheme  and  channel  code  rate   to  equalize  the  existing  radio  channel  capacity  assigned  for  each  user.

Neto  For  downlink  data  transmission  in  LTE  systems,  the  Base  Station  or  Evolved  Node  B   eNodeB   usually  selects  the  modulation  scheme  and  the  code  rate  depending  on  the  prediction  of  the  downlink  channel  conditions  [3]. An  impor- tant piece of information for this selection process is the Channel Quality Indicator   CQI   feedback  transmitted  by  the  User  Equipment   UE   in  the  uplink  channel.  CQI  feedback  is  an  indicator  of  the  data  rate  that  the  channel  can  support,  tak- ing into consideration the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio  SINR  and the  receiving characteristics of the UE [4, 5, 6]. This chapter explains the link adapta- tion principles applied to the LTE system. It will also show how the eNodeB can  select one of the two different CQI feedback schemes, namely periodic mode or  aperiodic mode.  The  eNodeB  will  create  a  trade-off  between  the  best  downlink  adaptation,  based  on  the  CQI   considering  the  informed  channel  quality ,  and  the  overload  on the uplink channel caused by the CQI itself, i.e., channel quality control traf- fic.  There  exists  therefore  a  trade-off  between  downlink  adaptation  and  uplink  overload.  LTE specifications are designed to provide the needed indicators for interoper- ability between eNodeB and UE, enabling the eNodeB to optimize link adaptation.  The method that the eNodeB will use to explore available information is not stand- ardized and as such left up to the manufacturer.  In general, in response to CQI feedback, the eNodeB can choose between dif- ferent modulation schemes  QPSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM  and a wide range of  code rates. As it will be discussed later on in this chapter, the ideal switching point  between  the  different  modulation  combinations  and  the  code  rate  depends  on  a  series  of  factors  that  include  the  required  Quality  of  Service   QoS   and  the  cell  throughput.  The channel code scheme for FEC, which is the basis for the code rate adapta- tion mechanism, was the object of an in-depth study during the LTE standardiza- tion  process.  The  channel  coding  theory  has  been  intensely  researched  over  the  last  decades,  especially  with  the  discovery  of  turbo  codes,  offering  performance  close  to  the  Shannon  limit  and  the  development  of  general  iterative  processing  techniques. More advanced channel coding resources were added, with the intro- duction of link adaptation, including Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest  HARQ ,  a  combination  of ARQ  and  channel  coding,  improving  robustness  against  chan- nel fading. These schemes include incremental redundancy, by means of which the  code  rate  is  progressively  reduced,  transmitting  additional  parity  information  at  each retransmission.  For LTE uplink transmission, the link adaptation process is similar to the down- link adaptation process, again with the eNodeB handling the selection of modula- tion and coding schemes  MCS . An identical channel coding structure is used for  the uplink, while the modulation scheme can be either QPSK or 16-QAM, and for  the maximum UE category, 64-QAM modulation is also available. The main differ- ence between the uplink and downlink is that, instead of basing link adaptation on  CQI feedback, the eNodeB can make its own estimate of the uplink data rate that  the sounding channel can handle, e.g, by using Sounding Reference Signals  SRS .   Link Adaptation in LTE Systems  105  An important final aspect regarding link adaptation is its use for time and fre- quency  scheduling  of  multiple  users,  which  allows  radio  transmission  resources  to be efficiently shared among the users  since the channel capacity for individual  users  varies .  CQI  can  therefore  be  used  not  only  to  adapt  code  rate  and  modu- lation  in  response  to  actual  channel  conditions,  but  for  optimal  time-frequency  selective scheduling and for managing interference among the cells.  The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 the principles  of link adaptation are described; in Sect. 3,the mechanism of CQI feedback in LTE  is described; in Sects. 4 and 5, the two types of CQI reporting are described: ape- riodic and periodic; and in Sect. 6 experimental laboratory experiments and their  corresponding results are described.  2   Link Adaptation and Feedback Computation  In  cellular  communication  systems,  the  quality  of  the  signal  received  by  a  UE  depends  on  a  number  of  aspects,  including  channel  quality  level  of  interference  from other cells, and noise level. In order to optimize system capacity and cover- age for a specific transmission power, the transmitter  eNodeB, in LTE systems   must try to combine the data rate of each user based on the variations in quality of  the received signal [1, 2]. This method is commonly called link adaptation and is  usually based on Adaptive Modulation and Coding  AMC .  The degrees of freedom for AMC consist in the following  existing  MCS:   	 Modulation scheme: Low-order modulation  few data bits per modulated sym- bol, e.g, 2 bits per symbol in QPSK  is the most robust scheme and can tolerate  high levels of interference at the cost of lower transmission bit rates. In contrast,  high-order modulation  more bits per modulated symbol, e.g, 6 bits per symbol  in 64-QAM  offers higher bit rate but it is more prone to errors due to its greater  sensibility to interference, noise, and channel estimate errors. The latter scheme  is therefore useful only when the SINR is sufficiently high;   	 Code rate: For a given modulation scheme, the code rate can be chosen based  on the radio link conditions. Lower code rates can be used in the presence of  poor channel conditions, whereas higher code rates can be used when the SINR  is high enough. The adaptation of the code rate is achieved by applying punctur- ing or code repetition to reduce the code rate to the output of a code matrix.  A  key  issue  in AMC  design  for  LTE  systems  was  whether  all  Resource  Blocks   RBs  allocated to a user in a subframe should use the same MCS [3–6] or if the  MCS should be frequency dependent within each subframe. It was shown that, in  general, only a slight throughput improvement arises from a frequency-dependent  MCS, compared with a RB-common MCS, in the absence of transmission power  control.  However,  the  additional  overload  control  signaling  overhead  associated  with frequency-dependent MCS is hard to justify. Therefore, in LTE systems, the  modulation  and  channel  coding  rates  are  constant  over  the  allocated  frequency    106  R.T. Caldeira and G.G. Neto  resources  for  a  given  user,  and  time-domain  channel-dependent  scheduling  and  AMC are supported instead. In addition, when multiple transport blocks are trans- mitted to one user in a given subframe using multistream Multiple-Input Multiple- Output  MIMO , each transport block can use an independent MCS.  In LTE systems, the UE can be set up to report CQIs to assist the eNodeB in  selecting an appropriate MCS to use for downlink transmissions. The CQI reports  are  derived  from  the  received  downlink  signal  quality,  typically  based  on  the  respective measurements of the downlink reference signals. It is important to note  that in LTE, the reported CQI is not a direct indication of SINR. Instead, the UE  reports the highest MCS that it can decode with a transport block error rate  BLER   probability  not  exceeding  10  %.  Thus,  the  information  received  by  the  eNodeB  takes into account the characteristics of the UE receiver, and not just the prevailing  radio channel quality. Hence, a UE designed with advanced signal processing algo- rithms  for example, using interference cancellation techniques  can report a higher  channel  quality,  and  depending  on  the  characteristics  of  the  eNodeB’s  scheduler,  receive a higher data rate.  A  simple  method  for  the  UE  to  choose  an  appropriate  CQI  value  could  be  based on a set of BLER thresholds. Thereby, the UE would report the CQI value  corresponding  to  the  MCS  that  ensures  a  given  BLER,  based  on  the  measured  received signal quality. The list of modulation schemes and code rates, which can  be signaled by means of a CQI value, is shown in Table 1 [7].  AMC  can  exploit  the  UE  feedback  by  assuming  that  channel  fading  was  suf- ficiently slow. This requires the channel coherence time to be at least as long as  the time between the UE’s measurement of the downlink reference signals and the   Table 1   CQI index for each modulation scheme and code rate CQI index Modulation  Approximate code rate  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  No transmission QPSK QPSK QPSK QPSK QPSK QPSK 16QAM 16QAM 16QAM 64QAM 64QAM 64QAM 64QAM 64QAM 64QAM  – 0.076 0.12 0.19 0.3 0.44 0.59 0.37 0.48 0.6 0.45 0.55 0.65 0.75 0.85 0.93  Efficiency  information bits per  symbol  – 0.1523 0.2344 0.3770 0.6016 0.8770 1.1758 1.4766 1.9141 2.4063 2.7305 3.3223 3.9023 4.5234 5.1152 5.5547   Link Adaptation in LTE Systems  107  subframe  containing  the  correspondingly  adapted  downlink  transmission  on  the  Physical Downlink Shared CHannel  PDSCH .  However,  a  trade-off  exists  between  the  amount  of  CQI  information  reported  by  the  UE  and  the  accuracy  with  which  the AMC  can  match  prevailing  condi- tions. Frequent reports of the CQI in the time domain allow better matching to the  channel and interference variations, while fine resolution in the frequency domain  allows better exploitation of frequency-domain scheduling. However, both lead to  increased feedback overhead in the uplink. Therefore, the eNodeB can configure  both the time-domain update rate and the frequency-domain resolution of the CQI,  as discussed in the following section.  3   CQI Feedback in LTE  Both periodicity and frequency resolution to be used by a UE to report CQI are  controlled by the eNodeB. In the time domain, periodic and aperiodic CQI report- ing are supported. The Physical Uplink Control CHannel  PUCCH  is used only  for periodic CQI reporting; while the Physical Uplink Shared CHannel  PUSCH   is mainly used for aperiodic reporting of the CQI. This is how the eNodeB specifi- cally instructs the UE to send an individual CQI report embedded into a resource  that is scheduled for uplink data transmission.  The frequency granularity of the CQI reporting is determined by defining a num- ber  of  sub-bands   N ,  each  comprised  of  k  contiguous  Physical  Resource  Blocks   PRBs . The value of k depends on the type of CQI report considered. In each case  the number of sub-bands spans the whole system bandwidth and is given by  N = cid:31 N DL  RB cid:30  k cid:29    1   RB is the number of RBs which comprise the system bandwidth. The CQI  where N DL reporting modes can be wideband CQI, eNodeB-configured sub-band feedback, or  UE-selected sub-band feedback. These modes are explained in detail in the follow- ing section. In addition, in the case of multiple transmit antennas at the eNodeB,  CQI value s  may be reported for a second codeword.  For some downlink transmission modes, additional feedback signaling is trans- mitted  by  the  UE,  consisting  of  Precoding  Matrix  Indicators   PMI   and  Rank  Indicators  RI .  4   Aperiodic CQI Reporting  Aperiodic  CQI  reporting  transmitted  on  the  PUSCH  is  scheduled  by  the  eNo- deB by setting a CQI request bit in an uplink resource grant sent on the Physical  Downlink  Control  CHannel   PDCCH .

Table 2 summarizes the relationship between the  configured  downlink  transmission  mode  and  the Aperiodic  CQI  reporting  mode,  which can be:   a   Wideband feedback: The UE reports one wideband CQI value for the whole   system bandwidth.   b  eNodeB-configured  sub-band  feedback:  The  UE  reports  a  wideband  CQI  value for the whole system bandwidth. In addition, the UE reports a CQI value  for  each  sub-  band,  calculated  assuming  transmission  only  in  the  relevant  sub-band.  The  size  of  sub-band  k  is  a  function  of  the  system  bandwidth,  as  resumed in Table 3.   c   UE-selected  sub-band  feedback:  The  UE  selects  M  preferred  sub-bands  of  size k in the whole system bandwidth  where k and M are presented in Table 4  for  each  bandwidth . The  UE  reports  one  wideband  CQI  value  and  one  CQI  value presenting the average quality of the M-selected sub-bands.

If the PUSCH transmission resources are allo- cated to the UE in one of the periodic subframes, the periodic CQI report is sent  over  PUSCH.  Only  wideband  and  UE-selected  sub-band  feedback  are  available  for periodic CQI reporting for all downlink transmission modes. As in the case of  aperiodic CQI reports, the type of periodic report is decided by eNodeB via RRC  signaling.  While wideband feedback mode is similar to reports sent over PUSCH, the CQI  from UE-selected sub-band is different. In this case, the total number of sub-bands  N  is  divided  into  J  fractions  called  bandwidth  parts.  The  value  of  J  depends  on  system bandwidth, as summarized in Table 5. In the case of periodic UE-selected  sub-band  CQI  reporting,  one  CQI  value  is  computed  and  reported  for  a  single  selected  sub-band  from  each  bandwidth  part,  along  with  the  corresponding  sub- band index.  6   Experimental Results  In order to illustrate the LTE link adaptation performance, an experimental setup,  which was composed of real eNodeBs and UEs with variable attenuators to sim- ulate  the  link  path  loss,  was  built.  By  varying  link  attenuation  under  controlled    110  R.T. Caldeira and G.G. Neto  Fig. 1   Downlink throughput  Mbps  versus attenuation  dB   conditions  and  environment,  corresponding  variations  of  MCS,  SNR,  and  RSSI_RS were evaluated.  The following configuration was used in the reference setup of the LTE system:   	 5 MHz bandwidth  25 RBs   	 Attenuation variation: from 74 to 128 dB  	 CQI reporting mode 1-0  periodic wideband CQI reporting   	 Transmission mode: TM2  	 UDP and TCP traffic generated with iperf tool [8]  Figure  1  shows  the  downlink  throughput  and  Fig.  2  shows  the  modulation  and  code model based on attenuation variation. The terminal can connect to a network  with a link attenuation of up to 118 dB, and once connected, downlink channel can  operate with attenuation level up to 128 dB.  A  downlink  MCS  varying  from  0  to  9  corresponds  to  QPSK  modulation    2  bits  per  symbol ;  a  downlink  MCS  varying  from  10  to  16  corresponds  to  16-QAM modulation  4 bits per symbol ; and a downlink MCS varying from 17 to  28 corresponds to 64-QAM modulation  6 bits per symbol . Only downlink traffic  was used to calculate UE sensitivity.

RSSI_RS is defined as the total wideband power  received by the UE of all reference signal  RS  subcarriers.  7   Conclusion  This chapter has explained the link adaptation mechanism used in LTE systems.  For downlink data transmission in LTE systems, the eNodeB usually selects mod- ulation scheme and code rate depending on the prediction of the downlink channel  conditions. An  important  piece  of  information  for  this  selection  process  is  feed- back from the CQI transmitted by the UE in the uplink channel. For uplink trans- missions  in  LTE  systems,  the  link  adaptation  process  is  similar  to  the  downlink  process, with the eNodeB handling the selection of the MCS.  As described, the degrees of freedom for the link adaptation mechanism AMC  consist in the existing MCS. Furthermore, CQI feedback mechanisms in LTE com- prise  aperiodic  CQI  reports   wideband  feedback,  eNodeB-configured  sub-band  feedback, and UE-selected sub-band feedback  and periodic CQI reports.   112  R.T.

Mobile  communication  technology  systems  have  been  improving  constantly  to  meet the increasing demand of traffic generated by video and Web access appli- cations.  The  Long  Term  Evolution   LTE ,  which  began  to  gain  more  attention  from 2008 with the consolidation of its Release 8, has undergone constant evolu- tion, achieved mainly in anticipation of completion of the Release 12 by the 3rd  Generation Partnership Project [1].  This new standardization effort has acted in several areas, such as the interfer- ence cancellation, cooperation between cells, carrier aggregation, multiple anten- nas, among others, making the system more and more complex. LTE, operating in  the band of 450 MHz, mainly emerged as a proposal within the scope of Release  12, to bring broadband and communication services to areas served precariously  or  even  devoid  of  any  telecommunications  service,  such  as  the  rural  and  remote  locations. This is a new profile of LTE technology with the operation in the 450– 470  MHz  band,  which  can  provide  more  favorable  propagation  conditions  than  those obtained in higher frequency bands, resulting in higher than the radii of cov- erage of the current profiles standardized in 3GPP.  The  effort  for  the  specification  and  the  development  of  LTE  450  MHz  has  started focusing on the Brazilian scenario, where the deployment of this technol- ogy  should  contribute  to  the  government’s  goal  of  providing  universal  access  to  broadband  services  throughout  the  country,  trying  to  reach  all  Brazilian  citizens  [2]. This  means  providing  these  services  also  to  rural  areas,  covering  a  vast  ter- ritory  of  Brazil,  with  a  population  of  about  30  million  people.  To  this  end,  the  Brazilian government recently established policies to enable the use of this spec- trum  in  450  MHz  for  rural  areas,  which  culminated  in  2012  with  the  auction  of  operating  licenses,  based  on  Resolution  558  of  Anatel  [3].  Other  more  recent  initiatives of the government include the National Broadband Plan  PNBL , also  driven  by  the  availability  of  LTE  450  MHz  as  a  viable  alternative  to  meet  the  objectives  of  this  program  in  rural  areas.  These  actions  are  complementary  and  create  investment  leverage  conditions  for  the  telecommunications  industry,  con- tributing to the development of an even more promising and dynamic scenario.  The application of LTE 450 MHz is not restricted to the Brazilian scenario. The  3GPP  considers  this  profile  as  a  global  application  and  as  an  appropriate  option  for deployment of Fourth Generation  4G  cellular networks in regions with low  population density. The completion of this expansion is challenging, depending on  the definition of economically sustainable models, particularly when we consider  the deployment, operation, and maintenance of networks.  The  standardization  process  of  the  450  MHz  band  for  LTE  was  launched  in  September 2012 for a Brazilian company in the 3GPP for the first time. Several  challenges  were  faced  and  overcome,  related  to  spectrum  plumbing,  coexistence  with  adjacent  services,  and  definition  and  adjustment  of  transmission reception  performance parameters [4]. The goal was to create conditions which will allow  the  cell  coverage  of  the  order  of  tens  of  kilometers,  more  adequate  to  scenarios    Method and Test Environment …  115  lacking appropriate infrastructure, including items such as backhaul and electrical  installation.  Finally,  in  June  2013,  the  450  MHz  band  became  part  of  the  LTE  standard,  called band 31 [5], representing an important milestone for operators and indus- tries to intensify its investment in LTE technology for this band.  For the industry, this means developing products able to meet the specific oper- ating conditions of the mentioned priority application scenarios, with the attend- ance of cells covering extensive areas as one of the most important scenarios. This  directly impacts the random access procedure of PRACH, which must be adequate  and properly assessed.  Therefore,  this  chapter  aims  to  present  an  efficient  method  which  enables  the  evaluation,  adaptation,  and  validation  of  the  random  access  procedure  of  the  Physical Random Access Channel  PRACH  in the laboratory, resulting in a posi- tive impact on the development of the algorithms used in this procedure. The pres- entation  of  this  work  includes  a  description  of  the  implementation  of  the  testing  scenario in laboratory, the analysis of the results obtained in the laboratory by such  implementation, and a comparison with the results obtained in field tests to vali- date the results obtained in the laboratory.  The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Sect. 2 describes the ran- dom access procedure in the LTE system. Sect. 3 presents relevant aspects of the  Radio over Fiber  RoF  technology used as basis for the development of the labo- ratory setup. Sect. 4 details the implementation of the experimental evaluation sce- nario  and  provides  an  analysis  of  the  results.  Finally,  conclusions  are  offered  in  Sect. 5.  2   Random Access Procedure in LTE  A fundamental requirement for any mobile system is the possibility of the termi- nal  request  for  a  connection  configuration  on  the  reverse  link   or  uplink ,  com- monly  referred  to  as  random  access. This  connection  configuration  is  performed  in the LTE system through a specific channel called PRACH. This channel allows  initial  network  access  and  synchronization,  on  the  uplink  direction,  of  the  User  Equipment   UE   transmissions  with  the  temporal  frame  structure  determined  by the Base Station or Evolved Node B  eNodeB . Thus, once the connection is  established in the uplink, the UE may receive sufficient bandwidth allocation for  data transmissions on the Physical Uplink Shared CHannel  PUSCH  and control  on the Physical Uplink Control CHannel  PUCCH .  Therefore, the LTE PRACH is a physical channel designed for transmission by  the  UE  characterized  as  a  signal  preamble,  which  enables  the  eNodeB  to  calcu- late  the  frame  synchronization  parameter  known  as  Timing Advance   TA .  This  parameter is then informed by the eNodeB to the UE by the forward link  descent  or downlink , enabling the UE to do the temporal setting of transmissions, as the  uplink frame structure [6].   116  Fig. 1   Random access  procedure based on dispute  R.T. Caldeira et al.  In LTE, a fixed number of up to 64 preambles  or signatures  are available in  each cell [7] and the operation of the two kinds of PRACH procedures, based on  the occurrence or the absence of possibility of collision, depends on the partition  of these signatures between these two types of procedures.  For the PRACH procedure with possibility of collision occurrence  also known  as Contention Based, it will be described in this chapter in more detail because it  is the procedure adopted during the first attempt by the UE connection , four steps  are identified [6, 8]. These steps are illustrated in Fig. 1 and detailed below.  2.1   Step 1: Transmission of Random Access Preamble  It  has  1  byte  information,  indicating  the  L2 L3   Layer  2  and  Layer  3   message  length which will be transmitted in Step 3. The primary purpose of transmission  of the preamble is the eNodeB to indicate the presence of a random access attempt  and allow eNodeB to estimate the delay associated with the distance from the ter- minal. The estimated delay is used in Step 2 to adjust the timing of transmission in  the uplink frame.  2.2   Step 2: Answer to Random Access  Used  to  adjust  the  time  of  transmission  of  the  terminal,  it  is  estimated  based  on  estimated  delay  in  Step  1.  The  Random Access  Response   RAR   is  sent  by  the  eNodeB in the Physical Downlink Shared Channel  PDSCH  and addressed with    Method and Test Environment …  117  an identification  ID , called Random Access Radio Network Temporary Identifier   RA-RNTI , identifying the time–frequency slot in which the preamble has been  detected. The RAR carries:   a   The identity of the detected preamble, i.e., the signature to be used by the UE;  b   TA  instruction,  which  aims  to  synchronize  the  subsequent  uplink  UE  trans-   c   A  permit  or  initial  grant  of  uplink  resources   scheduling  grant   for  L2 L3   missions with the eNodeB;  message transmission in Step 3;   d   The  assignment  of  a  Temporary  Cell Cell-Radio  Network  Temporary  Identifier  TC-RNTI or C-RNTI  used to enable communication between the  terminal and the core network.  2.3   Step 3: L2 L3 Message  L2 L3 Message and terminal ID. This message is the first uplink transmission allo- cated in the PUSCH and makes use of Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest  HARQ .  It includes the Temporary C-RNTI allocated to the RAR in accordance with Step 2   or  C-RNTI  if  the  UE  has  already  entered  the  RRC_CONNECTED  state,  or  the  48-bit unique identification of the UE, if it is the first UE access to the service pro- vider’s network.  In case a preamble collision occurred in Step 1, the colliding UEs receive the  same Temporary C-RNTI via RAR, resulting in the superposition of uplink time– frequency resources when the UEs transmit their L2 L3 messages. The following  downlink message  in Step 4  allows a quick resolution of this conflict.  2.4   Step 4: Collision Resolution Message  The last step consists in transmitting a conflict resolution message from the Radio  Access Network  RAN , on the DL-SCH addressed to the terminal. This step also  enables the resolution of any conflict arising from attempts by several terminals to  access the system using the same resource available for random access.  It is important to highlight that the random access procedure in LTE does not  employ  any  mechanism  for  carrier  sense. Thus,  to  detect  whether  there  is  trans- mission in the PRACH in order to minimize the possibility of collision becomes  meaningless, since even when the PRACH is already occupied by another UE, it  still can be transmitted through this channel since the preamble sequences used by  different UEs are orthogonal. In fact, it is considered that there is a collision only  when more than one UE transmits with the same sequence selected among the 64  possible preambles and occupies a single time–frequency resource. To avoid colli- sions, the cells can be configured in the access network using statistics previously    118  R.T. Caldeira et al.  obtained  in  access  occurrences.  However,  in  this  configuration,  there  is  a  trade- off between the cell data flow and the magnitude of the resources available to the  PRACH. For a cell where there are a large number of hits, it is necessary to set up  more  opportunities  or  resources   subframes   for  the  PRACH  in  the  same  frame.  However, allocating more resources for the PRACH implies decreasing resources  for data transmission in the PUSCH, causing a reduction in the total throughput of  the cell.  The  PRACH  procedure  without  considering  the  possibility  of  collision   also  known  as  contention  free   is  only  used  in  handover  scenarios  or  when  data  is  received  in  the  downlink  with  the  UE  in  RRC_CONNECTED  state.  In  this  pro- cedure, the eNodeB reserves a set of preambles and in the occurrence of an appli- cable scenario, the eNodeB allocates one of these preambles. As this procedure is  completely controlled by the eNodeB, there are no bumps and the UE is informed  exactly when and which preamble sequence it should transmit.  3   Radio Over Fiber  RoF systems have a diversity of applications based on the possibility of distribu- tion of Radio Remote Units  RRU  comprising the antenna and the transmission  and reception chains consisting of radio frequency devices.  The applications of these systems benefit from the low transmission losses and  distortion of signals carried over optical fiber, increasing flexibility and the range  of applications.  Examples  of  this  flexibility  that  can  be  cited  are  the  distribution,  extent,  and  cell  formatting  in  mobile  system  [9],  the  centralization  of  the  installation  of  the  baseband units of base stations in a sheltered and air conditioned environment, and  the implementing transmission diversity schemes using multiple remote units and  antennas  Multiple-Input Multiple-Output—MIMO  [10].  In some of these applications, when the objective is to provide wireless infra- structure in urban areas with high density, installation within commercial buildings  and airport terminals, or in industrial environments characterized by high level of  electromagnetic interference and therefore subject to special requirements of ser- vice availability, radio-over-fiber solution has additional advantages. These advan- tages come from the ease of installation, operation and maintenance, as well as the  support for product-specific requirements, which result in significant cost savings. In  short,  the  fiber-radio  system  is  fundamentally  an  analog  transmission  sys- tem because it distributes the “waveform” directly on the frequency of the radio  bearer, a central unit to the Remote Access Unit  RAU , or remote units for sys- tems  using  MIMO  or  multisector  base  stations.  In  the  case  of  LTE  signal,  com- prising a set of subcarriers dynamically allocated, and high-level modulation, the  radio-over-fiber system becomes quite interesting because it shows the possibility  of signal transmission over long distances, without loss of capacity. These charac- teristics  have  been  proven,  for  example,  for  standard Worldwide  Interoperability    Method and Test Environment …  119  Fig. 2   Integration of the LTE system using RoF over a G-PON infrastructure  for Microwave Access  WiMAX  signals, which also uses Orthogonal Frequency- Division Multiplexing  OFDM  technology and high-level modulations [11].  Essential components of typical RoF solutions are electro-optical converter and  optical coupler. The first is an active device that converts an electrical RF signal,  modulated and with analog information in its input to an optical signal at its out- put, which carries these analog information. To compose the optical link two con- version  devices  are  needed:  the  transmitter  and  the  receiver.  The  coupler  allows  the insertion of optical signal into the fiber, enabling the sharing with other sys- tems,  for  example,  Gigabit  Passive  Optical  Network   G-PON   point-multipoint  or other patterns, making it a more economically attractive solution, especially in  cases where there are large distances between RAUs and the baseband of a wire- less broadband system.  Figure  2  illustrates  the  possibility  of  integrating  an  LTE  broadband  transmis- sion  system  operating  in  Frequency  Division  Duplexing   FDD   mode  with  a  G-PON network. In the figure the connections between the RAU and the unit con- taining the baseband, Head End Unit  HEU , using the RoF transmission inserted  in the G-PON’s optical fiber infrastructure network, are illustrated schematically.  The  infrastructure  connects  the  Optical  Line  Terminal   OLT   to  the  Optical  Network  Terminal   ONT .  In  such  integration,  performed  in  the  laboratory  at  CPqD,  but  using  the  standard  WiMAX  802.16e  operating  in  Time  Division  Duplexing  TDD  mode, the viability was checked via direct transmission signals   downlink  on 64-QAM modulation, over 20 km of fiber.  Figure 3 is a picture of the laboratory setup used. With this setup it was found  that the losses of efficiency of the system depend on the configuration of the opti- cal network, mainly on the type of splitter used in the distribution.  Figure 4 lists the relative transmission efficiency at its maximum rate  64-QAM  modulation  on the downlink as a function of the maximum attenuation  dynamic  range  and distance of optical link  4.14–20 km .   120  R.T.

Method and Test Environment …  Fig. 5   Test environment in  laboratory  121  The following elements are used to implement the test environment:   a   eNodeB LTE;  b   UE LTE;  c   Diplexers:  used  to  separate  or  unite  the  transmission   Tx   and  receive   Rx   channels, spaced in frequency  FDD , used in the RF link established between  the eNodeB and the UE;   122  R.T.

With  the  use  of  very  compact spools with fiber lengths of the order of tens of km, the emulation of  large distance links in the lab’s confined environment, becomes possible;   f   Attenuators   fixed  and  variable :  fixed  20  dB  attenuators  connected  to  the  input  of  the  electro-optical  converters   transmitting   to  assure  the  linearity  of the optical signal injected into or extracted from the fiber and thus main- taining  the  best  operating  point  at  the  optical  link.  The  variable  attenuators  connected to the outputs of the optical-to-RF converters have the function of  simulating the path loss at the link by the introduction of a compatible attenu- ation with distance from the link to be tested. Values used were close to those  observed in field tests, allowing to take into account other factors apart from  path loss. For instance, the loss due to the partial line of sight obstructions.  The main purpose of this test is to check the operation of PRACH channel algo- rithms, as well as the validation of the settings that allow the UE attach procedure  at maximum specified distance.  In other words, the goal is to validate the maximum cell radius set in the eNo- deB  in  a  controlled  laboratory  setting. This  approach  significantly  facilitates  the  subsequent execution of field tests.  To calculate the length of the air link simulated by the optical link, we use a  factor  of  1.5,  i.e.,  every  1  km  of  optical  fiber  link  corresponds  to  1.5  km  of  air  link. This correspondence is determined by the refractive index of the optical fiber   approximately  1.5  compared  to  air ,  which  directly  affects  the  speed  of  light  in  the fiber, that is, 50 % lower than the speed over the air [12].  In  the  eNodeB  configuration  files,  the  following  standard  parameters  for  the  PRACH configuration are changed to enable the maximum distance to be consid- ered between the UE and the eNodeB:  	 rootSequenceIndex:  corresponding  to  the  index  of  the  Zadoff–Chu  sequence,  identified  by  the  parameter  RACH_ROOT_SEQUENCE,  used  in  determining  the 64 possible PRACH sequences of the random access preamble provided in  the cell;   	 zeroCorrelationZoneConfig: used in the calculation of the preamble sequence;  	 highSpeedFlag:  this  flag,  when  active,  indicates  that  the  UE’s  scenario  usage  involves moving at high speed, resulting in higher frequency shifts as a result of  the Doppler effect;   	 prach_ConfigIndex:  used  in  the  definition  of  the  frame  resource  allocation  for   PRACH;   	 prach_FreqOffset: defines the first physical resource block to be allocated in an   access attempt through PRACH procedure.   Method and Test Environment …  4.2   Validation Method  123  The validation of the implementation of the PRACH procedure in the laboratory  consists of the following steps presented in the execution sequence below:   1   eNodeB configuration, according to the cell size and the preamble format;  2   Setting the variable attenuation on the output of the O E converter in order to   simulate the estimated path loss for the distance to be tested;   3   Calculating the lengths of optical fiber spools used in the test, corresponding   to the distance to be validated;   4   After  the  eNodeB  activation,  verify  that  the  UE  makes  the  Public  Land  Mobile  Network   PLMN   search  procedure   i.e.,  detects  and  processes  the  signal  transmitted  by  the  eNodeB .  Subsequently,  measure  the  parameters  related  to  the  signal  levels  received  by  the  UE  Received  Signal  Received  Power   RSRP   or  Received  Signal  Strength  Indicator   RSSI   and  signal-to- noise ratio  SNR ;   5   Verification  of  the  implementation  of  the  UE  attach  procedure   connect  and  register the user . This is the most important step, as it is the procedure that  occurs to validate the PRACH algorithm;   6   Performance evaluation of the link, including throughput testing and data file   transfer.  Note that the setup shown in Fig. 5 was set to equipment supporting operation in  transmission  with  Single-Input  Single-Output   SISO   mode  at  eNodeB  and  UE,  simplifying the test scenario. However, this characteristic does not invalidate the  above-described procedure or the proposed method, since the PRACH procedure  is not dependent on the transmission mode.  4.3   Experimental Results  The test scenario described in the previous section, used during the development of  software responsible for implementing the PRACH procedure, is illustrated in Fig. 6.  Several  versions  of  the  software  were  generated  and  tested,  and  some  of  the  results from tests performed in the laboratory were compared with those obtained  in field tests. The similarity of the results proves the effectiveness of the method.  To obtain the results presented in this chapter, a software version developed to  support the preamble format 0 was used and the following set of parameters for  the PRACH was used:  a   rootSequenceIndex = 328  b   zeroCorrelationZoneConfig = 14  c   highSpeedFlag = 0  d   prach_ConfigIndex = 0  e   prach_FreqOffset = 10   124  Fig. 6   Laboratory test setup  of LTE 450 MHz system  using optical fibers  R.T.

For the test in the laboratory, measurements were made for the lengths of opti-  cal fiber reels described in Table 1.  In  order  to  simulate  the  path  loss  corresponding  to  the  distances  of  the  links  simulated in the optical fiber environment, an additional attenuation was inserted  with the variable attenuator, as shown in Table 2.  Table 3 shows the results obtained under these conditions and according to the   procedure described in Sect. 4.  It is noteworthy that, in the laboratory, even the much larger distances to those  specified for a successful connection of the UE, it is possible to perform part of the  procedure, proven by detecting and processing, in the UE, the signal transmitted  by the eNodeB. In other words, failure of UE attach procedure is not necessarily  the result of a low signal level received by the UE, but by the impossibility of a    Method and Test Environment …  125  Table 3   Laboratory test results, UE distance  km   PLMN search OK OK OK OK OK  RSSI  dBm  −64 −84 −88 −91 −94  SNR  dB  27 22 20 17 12  Table 4   Field test results, near Campinas  SP  UE distance  km   PLMN search  RSSI  dBm   SNR  dB   OK OK OK OK OK  −71 −80 −91 −90 −74  20 20 10 14 22  UE attach OK OK OK NOK NOK  UE  attach OK OK OK OK OK  15.0 30.0 36.0 40.5 45.0  13 16 27 30 36  Table 5   Field test results, near Brasília  DF  UE distance  km  37 38 40 52  PLMN search OK OK OK NOK  RSSI  dBm  −78 −84 −92 –  SNR  dB  21 17 12 –  UE attach OK NOK NOK –  frame synchronization establishment, an essential step for the correct operation of  the processes in charge of the layers 2 and 3 of LTE.  After system validation in laboratory, field tests were conducted in various sce- narios for UE locations in points with the following distances from eNodeB: 13,  16, 27, 30, 36, 37, 38, 40, and 52 km.  For the distances presented in Tables 4 and 5, the results obtained in the field  tests are presented, considering the same parameters as used in the laboratory tests   with results presented in Table 3 .  Regrettably,  it  was  not  possible  to  perform  field  tests  for  the  same  distances  simulated in laboratory tests, because for the field tests we chose the most favora- ble points for the measurements.  It  is  important  to  note  that  for  tests  carried  out  at  distances  up  to  30  km  an  omnidirectional antenna was used, with a gain of 5 dBi, installed on the roof of  the car used in the tests, while for the tests at distances exceeding 30 km, a Yagi  antenna   directional   with  a  gain  of  13  dBi  was  used.  The  difference  in  perfor- mance is visible in Table 4, because the test 36 km showed better values of RSSI  and SNR, when compared with the values obtained in the test 30 km.   126  Fig. 7   Field test route, in the  city of Campinas  SP , near  CPqD premises  R.T.

Fig. 8   Field test route, in the  city of Sobradinho  DF , near  Brasília  DF    Method and Test Environment …  127  Another important detail to be discussed is related to the characteristics of the  area where the field tests were performed, since the results of tests performed at  distances of 13, 16, 27, 30, and 36 km were obtained in the city of Campinas  SP ,  with  the  eNodeB  and  its  antenna  installed  in  the  tower  of  CPqD   Fig.  7 ,  while  the  results  obtained  at  distances  of  37,  38,  40,  and  52  km  were  collected  in  the  region of Brasilia  DF  with the eNodeB and its antenna installed in the tower in  the city of Sobradinho  DF   Fig. 8 , i.e., in different conditions of topography and  morphology.  5   Conclusion  In this chapter we presented a method for the validation of the PRACH procedure,  which was widely used during the development of LTE 450 MHz at CPqD. This  method  is  particularly  useful  for  this  band,  because  one  of  the  main  advantages  of the LTE 450 MHz system is to attend to the cells with coverage of the order of  tens of kilometers.  The validation of the implementation of PRACH algorithms in the laboratory,  i.e., before the field tests, enabled the implementation of the necessary adjustments  with  a  significant  reduction  in  costs,  avoiding  the  costs  associated  to  activities  and resources necessary to carry out systemic tests in the field or in real operation  environment.  By  analyzing  the  results  obtained  in  the  laboratory,  including  the  confronta- tion with results obtained in the field, it was possible to validate, with a very good  accuracy, the distance limit for the UE attach procedure. Even before obtaining the  final version of software used in the field tests, tests were performed in the labora- tory in several versions. These tests made it possible to anticipate implementation  problems  and  make  the  necessary  adaptations  and  adjustments.  If  the  field  tests  would have been necessary to validate the implementation of PRACH algorithms,  the cost would be much higher and the impact on the development time would be  quite significant.  Other parameter measurements made during the tests, such as RSSI, SNR, and  system performance data transmission capacity  the latter is not considered in this  chapter because it is not relevant to the analysis of the method described in this  chapter , could not be compared because of the difficulty of reproduction in labo- ratory of all conditions encountered in the field. In fact, in the field, other factors,  such as fading, multipath, and presence of interference and influences associated  with  the  type  of  relief  and  antennas  used,  may  cause  discrepancies  between  the  values  obtained  in  the  field  and  laboratory.  It  is  important  to  remember  that  this  method enables, in the way it is currently implemented, to emulate only the path  loss and the propagation delay  by considering the relative refractive index of the  optical fiber .  Therefore, it is important to highlight that the results obtained so far are prom- ising,  justifying  the  use  of  the  method  as  a  development  tool  of  LTE  450  MHz    128  R.T. Caldeira et al.  system. Among the next steps in the development of the system, an increased cell  area, which must be of at least 70 km radius, is planned.  Among  other  improvements  planned  for  the  methodology,  aiming  toward  the  approach of the test in the laboratory to the scenario found in field tests, the inclu- sion of interfering signals and the incorporation of fading simulators, considering  variations of signals associated with mobility, can be highlighted.

The  behavior  of  the  embedded  eNodeB  quality  of  service   QoS   aware  scheduler  is  evaluated  when  different  LTE  configurations  of  QoS  and  cell  con- ditions  are  taken  into  consideration.

The long term evolution  LTE  technology has been a hot research topic in wire- less communications due to its central role in the standardization of next-genera- tion  cellular  systems  carried  out  by  third  generation  partnership  project   3GPP .  In densely populated areas, LTE systems have mostly been deployed in standard  3GPP frequency bands, such as the 700 MHz and 2.6 GHz bands. In order to ben- efit  from  the  superior  propagation  characteristics  of  lower  frequencies  in  a  new  LTE profile suitable for sparsely populated areas, 3GPP has recently standardized  the 450–470 MHz range as 3GPP Band 31 [1].  Since  its  Release  8,  the  LTE  standard  defines  different  quality  of  service   QoS  levels for data, video and voice over internet protocol  VoIP  services [2].  Scheduling  mechanisms  for  VoIP  calls  in  LTE  systems  have  been  studied  via  simulation.  In  [3],  for  instance,  the  capacity  derived  when  dynamic  schedulers  are employed in multi-cell scenarios  low mobility, 5 MHz operation bandwidth   is shown to depend on the control plane resource allocation scheme. It turns out  from this study that up to 50–300 simultaneous calls per cell can be supported by  dynamic schedulers depending on the number of symbols available to the physi- cal  downlink  control  channel   PDCCH .  In  contrast,  the VoIP  traffic  that  can  be  accommodated using semi-persistent mechanisms is shown to be fixed and around  175 calls per cell. All in all, the message conveyed by Puttonen et al. [3] is that  one has to cope with some capacity constraints when dynamic scheduling packets  are used with persistent scheduling mechanisms.  The aforementioned multi-cell scenario is extended in [4] for different opera- tion  bandwidths  and  inter-cell  distances.  The  results  shown  present  the  absolute  VoIP  capacity  numbers  of  the  LTE  downlink.  It  is  also  shown  that  link  adapta- tion together with packet bundling provides a clear gain in capacity, as more VoIP  packets can be scheduled in each transmission time interval  TTI . Limitations in  the control channel can also be effectively compensated by packet bundling. End- to-end delays and throughput in the presence of VoIP traffic are assessed in [5] for  several  scenarios  considering  stationary  and  mobile  terminals.  In  the  absence  of  mobility, it is shown via simulation work that the delays are slightly higher for net- works congested with VoIP only. In other cases, better performance is derived due  to the presence of moving terminals.  Notwithstanding the value of the related work toward a better understanding of  VoIP using LTE infrastructure, their results primarily rely on simulation work and  exploit various parameters in a multiple cell environment, leading to experiments  almost impossible to be performed with real equipment. One alternative to com- plement such purely theoretical modeling and analysis is practical implementation,  as  it  can  be  employed  to  validate  the  design  of  algorithms,  protocols,  software,  and  hardware  under  a  genuine  radio  frequency   RF   environment.  Motivated  by  the several ways in which measurement-based experimentation may be rewarding,  the performance of VoIP calls on a real LTE system was evaluated in a previous  work of the authors [6]. Among the conclusions drawn therein, it was found that    Experimental Assessment of Voice Over IP …  131  the scheduler provides good quality of VoIP service when the QoS class identifier   QCI  type guaranteed bit rate  GBR  is used. In this chapter, we conduct a meas- ured-based performance assessment of VoIP in LTE systems. Our analysis consid- ers different positions of the terminal inside the cell, i.e., different signal reception  conditions for a fixed number of VoIP calls. Concurrent traffic with congestion is  also taken into account. These settings differ from those used in [6] in that there  the number of calls is allowed to vary but terminal positions are kept fixed, and the  concurrent traffic considered is now with and without congestion.  Our  results  suggest  that,  among  the  schedulers  available  at  the  eNodeB,  only  the one with QoS aware weighted priority  WP  and GBR maintains call quality  under congestion operation conditions. It is worth mentioning at this point that one  distinguishing aspect between VoIP and voice over LTE  VoLTE  is that the latter  employs an IP multimedia subsystem  IMS  for call control [7]. VoLTE also calls  for  eNodeB  support  for  semi-persistent  scheduling,  TTI  bundling,  header  com- pression, and the terminal needs to support the AMR-WB codec [8]. The tests pre- sented herein focus on the LTE QoS behavior using the G711u codec encapsulated  within a real-time transport protocol  RTP  data packet under data traffic conges- tion  [9].  The  data  packets  are  generated  using  a  tool  that  simulates  the  G711u  RTP payload and simply creates VoIP traffic between two personal computer  PC   endpoints.  The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 overviews the  basics of QoS provisioning in LTE networks. Scheduler algorithm and the figures  of merit used to evaluate voice quality in our experiments are also described there.  We  carry  on  in  Sect.  3  with  a  description  of  the  experimental  setup  based  upon  which three test scenarios are considered. Results for these scenarios are then dis- cussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 wraps up the chapter with some remarks and future  works.  2   Fundamentals of QoS in LTE Networks  This  section  describes  briefly  the  fundamentals  of  QoS  in  LTE  network.  Section 2.1 explains about the service bearers used to establish a QoS connection  between the devices that communicates in a LTE network. Section 2.2 introduces  the  QoS  parameters  and  their  properties  used  to  define  the  bearer  characteristics  for the VoIP data packets’ transport and Sect. 2.3 explains a resumed overview of  the scheduler algorithm used to optimize the QoS within the network to allow the  best VoIP data flow.  The  LTE  standard  has  been  designed  bearing  in  mind  the  need  to  provide  appropriate capabilities for different service categories, such as voice, video, mes- saging, and exchange of data files. This is possible thanks to an implementation of  QoS control supported by architectures defined by 3GPP [2, 10]. In evolved packet  systems  EPS , QoS control takes place at the level of the service flows, referred to  as bearer services in the context of LTE. The traffic mapped onto a specific bearer    132  R. Takaki et al.  service is treated equally with respect to packet forwarding, including the applica- tion of policies for scheduling and queue management. Different service flows are  available  to  make  the  implementation  of  different  packet  forwarding  treatments  possible,  namely  default  bearers  and  dedicated  bearers.  Default  and  dedicated  bearers are briefly described in the sequel along with QoS parameters, the sched- uling algorithm implemented at the eNodeB, and the metrics used for evaluating  voice quality later on in the performance characterization of our experiments.  2.1   Service Bearers  The default service bearer is established whenever the user equipment  UE  con- nects  to  the  packet  data  network   PDN .  This  bearer  possesses  the  basic  QoS  capacities. For each PDN that the UE connects to, a default bearer is established.  Any additional bearer established between the UE and the same PDN connection  resulting by demanded services with specific QoS requirements is called a dedi- cated  bearer.  In  general,  a  bearer  is  characterized  in  terms  of  the  bit  rate  guar- antees  it  provides. A  bearer  is  then  said  with  GBR  when  the  network  resources  related to the associated GBR value are permanently allocated in the constitution  or the modification of the service flow. Likewise, a bearer characterized as with- out GBR, i.e., non-GBR, provides no guarantee that a given bit rate is supported  for that service flow. In either case, a bearer is associated with a set of IP packet  filters that control the user traffic carrying the user service for a specific bearer.  Filtering mechanism in the uplink traffic flow template  UL-TFT  and downlink  traffic flow template  DL-TFT  is performed according to the pictorial description  given in Fig. 1.

For  non-GBR  bearers,  QCI  and ARP  are  the  sole  parameters  specified.  For  GBR  bearers,  QCI, ARP,  GBR,  and  MBR  parameters are all specified. In this chapter, we consider the QoS parameters that  influence the performance analysis of voice calls in 450 MHz LTE network only.  The  QCI  parameter  defines  the  QoS  class  associated  with  a  bearer,  and  is  used  as  a  reference  to  specific  parameters  that  control  packet  forwarding  treatment  in  the bearer, namely packet delay budget  PDB  and packet error loss rate  PELR .  The nine QCI values mandated by 3GPP are summarized in Table 1. Voice service  flow, video, messaging, and file transfer have different characteristics and are asso- ciated with different QCIs. The GBR parameter identifies the bit rate that should  be guaranteed for a given GBR bearer, while the MBR parameter sets the MBR  allowed for that bearer.  2.3   Scheduler Algorithm  As  with  the  identifiers  assigned  to  dedicated  bearers,  which  ensure  the  neces- sary  traffic  for  voice  packets  in  terms  of  resource  type,  priority  level,  PDB,  and  PELR, the scheduler role is also of utmost importance to ensure the correct sched- uling  of  multiple  packets  traversing  the  eNodeB.  Here,  the  QoS  aware  approach  implemented in the eNodeB is based on the WP algorithm [11]. This proprietary  algorithm  basically  computes  the WP  of  each  bearer  created  in  accordance  with  modulation aspects, class of service, delay, and traffic prioritization. Once priori- ties are assigned to the bearers, all traffic flows are served with resources allocated  according to the corresponding bearers, with the priority order set up to the limit  of exhausted resources.  One alternative for measuring the resulting voice quality of a scheduler is mean  opinion  score   MOS ,  a  subjective  method  defined  by  the  ITU-T  P.800  standard    134  R. Takaki et al.  Fig. 2   Setup used in our experiments  Table 2   MOS scores  obtained using the E-model  algorithm  Inferior limit 4,34 4,03 3,60 3,10 2,58  Degree of user satisfaction Very satisfied Satisfied Some users unsatisfied Many users unsatisfied Almost all users unsatisfied  [12].  The  transmitted  and  received  voice  quality  are  evaluated  according  to  an  algorithm that gives scores on a scale of 1–5, where 1 and 5 correspond to “bad”  and  “excellent”,  respectively.  The  tool  used  in  the VoIP  service  performance  test  between PC1 and PC2  shown in Fig. 2, which will be explained in the next section   uses the E-Model algorithm, defined by the ITU-T G.107 standard [13] as a means  to estimate the MOS quality for every pair of endpoints. Table 2 lists the MOS val- ues obtained from the execution of this algorithm. In order to verify the behavior of  the scheduler algorithm another metric that can be used in addition to MOS is PDB,  as it is among the QCI characteristics in Table 1. In our experiments, we compute  delay variations relative to the delay measured at the center of the cell using   σ  %  =  σpos − σref  ,  σref   1   where  the  subscript  pos  is  the  delay  at  the  position  of  interest   measured  in  the  middle or on the edge of the cell  and subscript ref is the reference delay  meas- ured in the center of the cell .  3   Experiment Setup and Test Scenarios  This section presents the general experiment setup and test scenarios. Section 3.1  describes the real-world experiment setup considering the LTE system equipment  and test tools as well as the configuration of these device parameters. Moreover,  Sect. 3.2 describes the test scenarios in order to verify the behavior of VoIP calls  considered in this chapter.

External interference  is  kept  under  control  by  connecting  the  eNodeB  to  the  UE  through  an  RF  cable  with a variable attenuator, which allows us to vary the signal-to-noise ratio  SNR   to  mimic  changes  in  the  UE  position  within  the  cell. We  consider  the  frequency  range 450–470 MHz  3GPP Band 31 , 5 MHz operation bandwidth, and different  modulation  schemes  using  25  physical  resource  blocks.  The  test  topology  com- prises  two  PC  endpoints  monitored  by  the  testing  tool  IxChariot  [14].  Such  PC  endpoints  are  responsible  for  sending  and  receiving  dedicated  RTP  traffic  [9].  Termination  points  PC1  and  PC2  relate  to  UE  and  evolved  packet  core   EPC ,  respectively. The network that connects to the EPC includes PC3, with IxChariot  tool  controlling  the  two  endpoints  and  generating  reports  for  different  traffic  parameter configuration, and MOS and delay variation measurements.  The VoIP traffic performance tests were conducted using test scenarios includ- ing LTE network devices with QoS parameters appropriately configured, and with  the IxChariot tool configured to generate, measure, and report both dedicated RTP  traffic and concurrent traffic based on the transmission control protocol  TCP  or  the user datagram protocol  UDP . In all tests the RTP traffic generated is always  transported  through  a  dedicated  bearer,  and  the  concurrent  traffic   either TCP  or  UDP   flows  are  transported  through  a  default  bearer.  Both  types  of  concurrent  traffic were generated using Iperf [15]. The QoS control behavior was verified for  RTP traffic under the cell reception conditions listed in Table 3. These conditions  reflect  different  signal  intensities  obtained  by  reception  through  RF  attenuator  adjustments.  Finally,  the  system  was  evaluated  under  different  eNodeB  modula- tion configurations, such as adaptive modulation and fixed modulation, quadrature  amplitude modulation  64-QAM , and quadrature phase shift keying  QPSK  used  in the uplink and downlink. All tests were performed with 20 pairs of RTP conver- sation,  corresponding  to  20  concurrent  voice  calls  with  the  G.711  codec  config- ured and generated with the IxChariot tool for rate 1.280 kbps.  3.2   Test Scenarios  Table 4 summarizes the test scenarios considered in this chapter. In all scenarios  and cases considered, we assume that default bearers are set with QCI = 9  non- GBR   and  adaptive  modulation  is  in  use  at  the  eNodeB  unless  otherwise  stated.    136  R.

The  experiment  is  repeated  for  the  self-explan- atory  cases  “no  concurrent  traffic”,  “TCP  concurrent  traffic  without  conges- tion”,  and  “UDP  concurrent  traffic  without  congestion”.  In  scenario  II,  the  test  consists  of  passing  a  RTP  traffic  flow  through  a  dedicated  bearer  with  QCI =  1   type GBR , and a concurrent TCP traffic flow through a default bearer. The cases  considered here are “no concurrent traffic”, “TCP concurrent traffic with conges- tion”,  and  “TCP  concurrent  traffic  without  congestion”.  Scenario  III  augments  scenario II by letting the modulation scheme used at the eNodeB vary among the  cases “adaptive modulation”, “QPSK”, and “64-QAM”. For quick referencing, the  last column of Table 4 links the test scenarios to the figures providing their corre- sponding results. These will be discussed later on in Sect. 4.  TCP  traffic  transmitted  through  the  default  bearer  under  concurrent  condition  corresponds to the maximum throughput supported by the LTE channel under dif- ferent cell reception conditions and modulation schemes. This ascertains that the  default bearer traffic competes with the dedicated bearer traffic in the event of a  congestion condition, thus allowing us to check the system behavior using the QoS  aware WP  scheduler.  In  the  absence  of  congestion,  the  traffic  transmitted  in  the  default bearer assumes a value below the maximum throughput supported by the  LTE channel, enabling RTP traffic through the dedicated bearer below the conges- tion threshold.   Experimental Assessment of Voice Over IP …  137  4   Experimental Results  In this section, we present preliminary results aimed at evaluating the implemen- tation of the WP QoS aware algorithm for maintaining quality of VoIP service as  mandated by the 3GPP LTE standard. The experimentally driven assessment dis- cussed in what follows considers the test scenarios in Tables 3 and 4.  MOS  and  delay  variation  results  obtained  for  scenario  I  are  shown  in  Fig.  3.  According  to  Fig.  3a,  the  MOS  decreases  as  the  UE  moves  from  the  center  to  the  middle  of  the  cell  to  then  increase  as  the  UE  further  moves  toward  the  cell   4.1   Test Scenario I  Fig. 3   Test scenario I: MOS  and delay variation measured  for different QCI settings  using RTP traffic in the  absence and in the presence  of TCP UDP concurrent  traffic without congestion.  a MOS without concurrent  traffic. b Delay variation  without concurrent traffic.   c MOS with concurrent  traffic  QCI = 1 . d MOS  with concurrent traffic   QCI = 7    138  Fig. 3    continued   R. Takaki et al.  edge. It can also be seen from the figure that regardless of the QCI considered, the  MOS  assumes  values  ranging  from  “some  users  unsatisfied”  to  “very  satisfied”.  However,  thanks  to  the  QoS  aware  WP  scheduler,  which  prioritizes  GBR  flows  over  non-GBR  flows,  the  MOS  degradation  perceived  as  the  UE  moves  toward  the cell edge is more significant for QCI = 7 than for QCI = 1. As for the delay  variation, a substantial increase is observed in Fig. 3b as the UE departs from the  center of the cell and approaches the cell edge. For QCI = 7, the delay variation  on the cell edge is roughly three times higher than that measured for QCI = 1 at  the same position. If we now move on to the results of MOS with concurrent traf- fic, shown in Fig. 3c, d for QCI = 1 and QCI = 7, respectively, we see a dramatic  MOS degradation for QCI = 7 but not for QCI = 1. While the MOS remains in  between “satisfied” and “very satisfied” for QCI = 1, it undergoes a big drop from  “very satisfied” to “many users un satisfied”. This is in good agreement with our    Experimental Assessment of Voice Over IP …  139  Fig. 4   Test scenario II:  MOS and delay variation  measurements obtained  using RTP traffic under TCP  concurrent traffic with and  without congestion. a MOS   QCI = 1 for RTP, QCI = 9  for TCP . b Delay variation   QCI = 1 for RTP, QCI = 9  for TCP   expectations, as the QoS aware WP scheduler again prioritizes QoS with QCI = 1   even under unfavorable concurrent traffic conditions . When it comes to the type  of concurrent traffic, the variations in MOS observed for TCP and UDP traffic are  minimal for both QCIs.  4.2   Test Scenario II  MOS  and  delay  variation  results  obtained  for  scenario  II  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.  Under different traffic conditions, it is shown in Fig. 4a that the MOS once again  decreases  as  the  UE  moves  from  the  center  to  the  middle  of  the  cell  to  then  increase  when  the  UE  further  moves  toward  the  cell  edge.  However,  the  careful    140  R. Takaki et al.  reader will see that the overall MOS score without concurrent traffic is lower than  with concurrent traffic. While this finding may sound somewhat counterintuitive,  it  is  indeed  related  to  the  QoS  aware WP  scheduler   which  prioritizes  the  GBR  traffic flow so as to maximize the system performance under concurrent non-GBR  traffic flows . MOS variations due to both type of concurrent traffic and changes  in the UE position within the cell are not that significant, as a result of QoS aware  WP scheduling working alongside with adaptive modulation.  Figure 4b shows that the increase in delay variation in one direction varies from  20 to 30 % as the UE moves from the cell of the center toward the cell edge. This  suggests that the QoS aware WP scheduler is prioritizing the GBR traffic flow so  as to maximize its performance in the presence of a concurrent non-GBR traffic  flow.  4.3   Test Scenario III  MOS results obtained for scenario III are shown in Fig. 5. When 64-QAM is in  use, the MOS decreases as the distance between the UE position and the center of  the  cell  increases.  In  contrast,  when  adaptive  modulation  or  QPSK  is  employed,  the MOS decreases as the UE moves from the center to the middle of the cell to  then increase as the UE further moves toward the cell edge. Regarding the adap- tive  modulation,  the  message  conveyed  by  the  MOS  behavior  observed  here  is  that  the  modulation  order  does  not  change  as  the  UE  moves  from  the  center  to  middle of the cell, but does change as the UE moves from the middle to the edge   of the cell.

The behavior of the embed- ded  eNodeB  QoS  aware  scheduler  is  evaluated  when  different  LTE  configura- tions of QoS and cell conditions are taken into consideration. Our results suggest  that  the  aforementioned  scheduler  is  capable  of  maintaining  VoIP  quality  using  QCI =  1  with  concurrent  traffic  over  default  bearer  or  even  over  the  non-GBR  dedicated bearer. The  QoS  aware  algorithm  works  in  such  a  way  that  the  MOS  parameter  remains  constant  even  in  adverse  conditions,  for  instance,  under  concurrent  traf- fic  delay  increase  conditions,  or  in  the  presence  of  signal  reception  degradation  due to the UE position within the cell. Regarding adaptive modulation, our results  suggest that the modulation order decreases as the UE moves from the middle to  the edge of the cell. However, the same does not happen as the UE moves from the  center to the middle of the cell. Despite the preliminary nature of our results, this  is a clear indication that the adaptive modulation is not working properly on the  eNodeB  software  version  used  in  our  test  scenarios. Apart  from  that,  the  results  obtained in our tests demonstrate accordance with the QoS standards mandated by  3GPP. As future work, new tests will be carried out to augment the present work  with other important variables, such as, new codecs used by the LTE technology,  other QCI comparisons, different LTE VoIP QoS control mechanisms, and differ- ent  modulation  schemes,  with  the  aim  of  verifying  the  technology  robustness  in  application  scenarios  with  UE  mobility  and  interference  presence.  We  also  plan  to  repeat  the  tests  after  having  corrected  the  adaptive  modulation  software,  and  consider over-the-air test scenarios focusing on QoS tests for performance of VoIP  calls over LTE.

This chapter evaluates the LTE network system composed  by radio access and core network with impairments to LTE technology character- istics,  introduced  by  geostationary  satellite  link  as  backhaul  connectivity  to  the  system. The study is carried out including tests of throughput, latency, and voice  service  that  are  provided  through  the  satellite  link.  Two  distinct  environments,  namely a simulated satellite link and a real-world satellite link, are taken into con- sideration. The first one is carefully assembled in the laboratory to reflect the typi- cal effects of satellite link delay on the LTE protocol and its consequent impacts  on  data  transmission  and  real-time  services.  The  second  environment  features  a  real-world satellite link, made available to CPqD by a geostationary satellite net- work  operator.  The  LTE  network  system  used  in  both  environments  consists  of  practical devices and prototypes developed by CPqD for operation in the 450 MHz  band, and targeting application in sparsely populated areas. Presented results show  that  satellite-based  backhaul  is  a  technically  feasible  option  for  LTE  networks,  and  the  introduced  impairments  are  not  a  real  limitation  for  provided  services,  thus leveraging the deployment of such networks in rural and sparsely populated  remote areas.

Satellite access links for services like voice, video, and Internet access have been  widely used over the past years, providing access to these services at remote and  sparsely populated regions. However, until recently, the use of satellite access link  for  these  scenarios  was  considered  a  challenge  due  to  the  results  of  low  attrac- tiveness of investment returns for telecommunication operators. This low return of  investment  was  caused  by  reduced  local  users’  traffic  demand  per  coverage  area  and high cost for deployment and operation of this type of access link.  The adoption of low-cost satellite equipment stations, such as geostationary sat- ellite  orbit   GSO   very  small  aperture  terminals   VSATs   [1],  in  a  large  number  in  remote  areas   typically  countryside  areas ,  does  not  totally  solve  commercial  issues, maintaining, as a challenge, the expansion and provision of these services  to the population of these areas. However, with the possibility of using this low- cost equipment station to provide satellite system as backhaul for a local wireless  access system, it becomes very interesting and capable of boosting the expansion  in areas lacking infrastructure. In that solution, the interface between the core net- work and remote end user network, or last mile, is an open field for different tech- nologies to provide services to these remote areas even considering impairments  introduced by the satellite communication [2], this is a very interesting option.  After  standardization  of  the  band  31   range  of  450  MHz   for  the  3GPP  LTE  [3],  one  of  the  most  viable  possibilities  began  to  be  the  integration  of  LTE  net- work with the satellite backhaul. Besides the positive economic aspects resulting  from  standardization,  other  important  factors  are  the  450  MHz  range  suitabil- ity  to  obtain  extensive  cell  coverage,  appropriate  to  the  application  in  rural  and  sparsely populated remote areas, and the availability of entitlement usage of this  range through auctions coordinated by ANATEL [4]. The reference model for this  network solution integrating the LTE and satellite backhaul is shown in Fig. 1 in  which different network services for users  voice and public Internet access  are  centralized and connected to the concentrating station  HUB  subnetwork and the  LTE  radio  access  network  is  connected  to  a VSAT  station  located  at  a  strategic  remote area.  In  tests  conducted  in  real-world  satellite  link  provided  by  satellite  system  operator,  two  Evolved  Packet  Core   EPC   [5]  integration  scenarios  were  consid- ered.  In  one  of  them,  the  EPC  is  collocated  in  the VSAT  remote  station  subnet- work, together with the base station or Evolved Node B  eNodeB  [6]. In another  scenario, the EPC is collocated in the HUB station subnetwork far away from the   I.L. Junqueira  e-mail: ivanj@cpqd.com.br  J. Seki  e-mail: jseki@cpqd.com.br  J.P.

For these scenar- ios,  tests  were  performed  including  latency,  data  throughput,  and  public  Internet  connection  speedtest.  To  determine  the  quality  of  voice  services,  tests  included  voice over Internet Protocol  VoIP  calls along with latency, throughput, jitter, and  MOS measurements.  The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Sect. 2 contains a brief  description  about  Satellite VSATs;  information  about  the  LTE  technology;  some  considerations  about  the  metric  used  to  evaluate  voice  transmission;  Perceptual  Evaluation of Speech Quality  PESQ  [7]; and commercial tool used in the tests,  the IxChariot [8] descriptions. Sect. 3 provides information about the test environ- ments used. Sect. 4 examines the obtained test results, and finally, Sect. 5 presents  conclusions and offers possibilities for future work associated with the topic cov- ered in this chapter.  2   Technical Aspects of the Components Used  This section shows relevant aspects of the elements used on the created setups to  build the testing scenario.  2.1   Satellite VSATs  VSATs are devices formed by antennas with limited diameters, usually to 2.4 m   may  reach  5  m  exceptionally,  depending  on  the  operational  circumstances   and  fixed  satellite  services,  implemented  in  shared  or  private  networks  and  in  dedi- cated  applications,  regulated  by  Recommendation  ITU-R  S.725  [1].  The  VSAT  stations operate at Ku band and are usually part of a network star topology, which  incorporates a central station called HUB, responsible for controlling and monitor- ing various VSAT remote stations. However, some networks can operate establish- ing point-to-point linkage or mesh configuration, without a central station HUB.   146  R. Takaki et al.  2.2   The LTE Architecture  LTE is a wireless technology that has been standardized by 3GPP [9] to provide all  IP-based  services,  in  order  to  replace,  gradually,  the  previous  wireless  technolo- gies  such as 2G and 3G  used to provide distinctive circuit switched based net- work for voice services, and packet switched based network for data services.  LTE  technology  uses  resources  that  enable  Quality  of  Service   QoS   deploy- ment,  configuration,  and  the  definition  of  priority  services  flows  for  data,  voice,  and video in real time. This ensures the necessary band for such services to oper- ate properly, even at the expense of bandwidth used by other services which do not  require  priority  for  their  usage,  such  as  Internet  access.  The  LTE  architecture  is  basically composed by the User Equipment  UE , the eNodeB, and the EPC [5]. In  the LTE architecture, the EPC is the entity responsible for default or dedicated ser- vice flows creation, whereby, respectively, flowing best-effort traffic services, such  as Internet access, and the priority real-time traffic, such as voice and video. Either  the default or the dedicated service flows  bearers  are created taking into account  QoS parameters classified according to the traffic type. Generally the default bear- ers are created using not guaranteed bit rate traffic  Non-Granted Bit Rate—non- GBR   parameter  values,  with  QoS  class  indicator   QoS  Class  Indicator—QCI   including values from 5 to 9 and with low prioritization  best-effort strategy . The  dedicated bearers are created using parameter values used to guarantee guaranteed  bit rate services  Granted Bit Rate—GBR  that include QCI values from 1 to 4 and  with  top  prioritization.  Figure  2  and  Table  1  show  typical  LTE  architecture  and  QoS-related QCI parameters, respectively.  2.3   Mean Opinion Score  The  mean  opinion  score   MOS   is  a  subjective  method  of  measurement  voice  quality,  defined  by  Recommendation  ITU-T  P.800  [10]. The  voice  quality  trans- mitted by one device and received by another is evaluated according to an algo- rithm  that  scores  according  to  a  scale  of  1-  5,  in  which Value  1  corresponds  to  a  bad  voice  quality  and  Value  5  corresponds  to  excellent  voice  quality.

Table 2 shows the  MOS values achieved from the E-model algorithm and used as a reference.  2.4   Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality  PESQ is a method standardized by the ITU-T [7], by Recommendation P.862 for  voice quality measures, and it can be used during installation, commissioning, and  possible  problems’  solution,  in  real  networks  that  use  telephony  devices.  PESQ  tool  that  incorporates  PESQ  algorithm  is  usually  installed  in  test  equipment,  but  can  also  be  integrated  into  routers,  telephone  exchanges,  voice  quality  enhanc- ers,  and  other  network  devices.  The  PESQ  measurement  is  considered  intrusive  since it compares the quality of real voice message transmitted through the system  with a reference obtained from the original signal. Among the tool features, it may  include:   a   Possibility of listening quality measures in intrusive applications;  b   Quality of accurate prediction in a wide variety of applications;   148  Fig. 3   PESQ algorithm   adapted from [12]   R.

The PESQ makes speech quality or voice measurements, in point to point and  in one direction. It is suitable to be used in intrusion test. A signal is transmitted  through the system to be tested and the degraded output is compared to the input  reference signal. Figure 3 illustrates the use of the simplified PESQ algorithm, a  PESQ score in the range of 1–4.5 is generated and a function is used to convert  these ITU-T P.800 PESQ values into the MOS scale.  2.5   IxChariot  IxChariot is an assessment network tool for troubleshooting and pre-assessment of  networks and applications. This tool simulates real-world applications, aiming to  predict the performance of devices, systems, and networks when subjected to real  traffic conditions. The IxChariot consists of:   a   A  server  or  console,  where  test  performances  are  configured  and,  later,  the   data collection and reports generation are performed;   b   At least two Performance Endpoints installed in devices included in the test  scenario. The endpoints are responsible for initiating traffic, receiving traffic,  and sending data to the IxChariot console.  Thus, there are three essential elements required for a test environment which uses  the IxChariot:   a   Console  tool  responsible  for  endpoints’  monitoring  and  responsible  for  gen-  eration of the measures’ results;   b   The  device  has  endpoint  1  which  communicates  directly  with  the  IxChariot   console and with Termination point 2, located at another device;   c   Termination point 2 that communicates only with the device which has end-  point 1.  Endpoint  1,  after  receiving  the  test  scripts  and  data  from  the  IxChariot  console,  coordinates  the  VoIP  test  actions  with  the  second  endpoint,  performs  the  test  instructions  generating  simulated  VoIP  calls,  and  returns  all  test  results  to  the    Integration Between LTE and Satellite Networks  149  Fig. 4   Basic test using the  IxChariot tool  IxChariot console.

Figure 4 shows a basic test environment using the IxChariot tool com- ponents and contains the IxChariot console and endpoints 1 and 2, necessary for  carrying out performance tests.  3   Description of Test Environment  Tests using the network integrated VSAT satellite link and LTE system were per- formed in two environments:   a   Simulated environment, from which the satellite network presence was simu- lated through a computer that implemented the delay characteristics of a real  satellite link scenario;   b   Real environment, wherein the satellite link used and the real operating envi-  ronment were provided by a carrier satellite system.  3.1   Simulated Scenario  In this environment, a computer with a delay simulator, a Linux application was  used  in  order  to  obtain  in  a  controlled  way,  the  delay  characteristic  value  found  in  a  real  satellite  link. The  simulator  was  configured  to  insert,  in  both  downlink  and uplink channels, a 300 ms delay, thus obtaining a 600 ms Round Trip Time   RTT  for the traffic between VSAT and HUB stations. The connections’ configu- rations were made taking into account the location of the EPC on the satellite-LTE  architecture as illustrated in Fig. 5.

The EPC could be located on this subnetwork for the test sce- nario shown in Fig. 5a or alternatively, in the HUB subnetwork where the opera- tor Public Internet access is located, including PC2 with IxChariot endpoint and  IxChariot  console  tool,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5b.  For  PESQ  measurement,  real VoIP  conversational  call  was  performed  using  the  softphone  installed  in  PC1  and  the  Analog  Terminal Adapter   ATA   connected  to  the  same  subnetwork  at  the  EPC  side. Table 3 summarizes the test scenarios used in the simulated environment.   Integration Between LTE and Satellite Networks  151  3.1.1   LTE Configuration  The eNodeB was configured to operate with central frequency equal to 450 MHz,  64-QAM  modulation  in  the  downlink  and  16-QAM  in  the  uplink,  maximum  power of 30 dBm, 8 Mbps flow in the downlink, and 1 Mbps in the uplink. The  EPC  has  been  configured  with  two  bearers,  one  dedicated  bearer  with  QCI =  1  and  UDP  filter   User  Datagram  Protocol   for  voice  traffic,  and  another  default  bearer with QCI = 7 for non-priority concurrent data traffic. VoIP calls were origi- nated and received through IxChariot endpoints, and for this, two PCs were used  as endpoints. Endpoint 1 was performed on PC1, connected into the UE terminal.  Endpoint 2 was performed on PC2, connected to the same subnetwork of the EPC,  as well as the IxChariot console tool. The real VoIP conversational calls were per- formed using the softphone installed in PC1 and the ATA connected to the subnet- work at the EPC side.  3.1.2   Performance Tests  Performance tests on the satellite simulated environment consisted in performing  real voice calls between PC1 and ATA and simulated calls between IxChariot end- points at PC1 and PC2. For both voice tests, traffic was generated with a concur- rent TCP  traffic  between  PC1  and  PC2,  routed  through  default. Table  4  lists  the  main tests made for performance evaluation. For latency and rate measurements,  the  speedtest  [13],  ping  and  iperf   version  2014   [14]  tools  were  used.  The  test  which used the speedtest tool consisted of latency verification by sending Internet  Control  Message  Protocol   ICMP   from  PC1  terminal  to  a  server  located  on  the  public Internet network.  The higher the distance between PCI and server, or the higher the network con- gestion, the higher was the latency. Another important measure, taken by speed- test, was the UDP packets flow measurement from the server at downlink direction  to the terminal and from the terminal at uplink direction to the server.  The  ping  tool,  unlike  speedtest  tool,  performed  the  latency  measurement  between PC1 and PC2, the latter one located after the delay simulator. The iperf  tool was used to flow UDP data packets, with a fixed rate, in download direction  between  PC2  and  PC1  and  in  upload  direction  between  PC1  and  PC2. The  tool  generated  a  concurrent  traffic  for  voice  traffic  and  provided  the  network  latency  evaluated  during  the  network  traffic  generated  presence.

The tests were performed  in both directions  download and upload . The second step was to conduct a real  voice call between PC1 and PC2 using the application PortGo [15] and to save the  generated  RTP  packets  during  the  call  flow,  through  the  wireshark  tool  [16],  for  data  extraction  and  processing,  to  finally  get  the  voice  quality  metrics  using  the  PESQ application.  3.2   Real Scenario  In this environment, the operational devices: VSAT station, satellite and HUB sta- tion,  available  under  operational  conditions  by  a  satellite  system  operator,  were  used.  The  connection  settings  were  made  taking  into  account  the  EPC  location  in  the  LTE-satellite  architecture,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6.  The  test  environment  was  formed  by  the  subnetwork  consisting  of  the  fixed  components:  PC1,  UE  termi- nal and eNodeB, and the VSAT station which was responsible for connecting the  LTE network components to the geostationary satellite. In this scenario, the EPC  was  located  in VSAT  subnetwork,  for  the  test  case  shown  in  Fig.  6a  or  located  at the HUB station subnetwork that interconnects the public Internet access, PC2,  PC with IxChariot console and PC2 with xChariot endpoint, as shown in Fig. 6b.  Table 5 summarizes the test scenarios used in the real environment.  3.2.1   LTE Configuration and Description of Performance Tests  As  in  the  simulated  scenario,  the  eNodeB  was  configured  to  operate  in  the  fre- quency  of  450  MHz,  64-QAM  modulation  on  the  downlink  and  16-QAM  in  the  uplink, maximum power of 30 dBm, 8 Mbps of throughput on the downlink, and 1  Mbps on the uplink.  The EPC was configured with two bearers, one dedicated bearer using QCI = 1  and UDP filter for voice traffic, and other default bearer with QCI = 7 for concur- rent data traffic. The satellite link in this scenario was provided with TCP acceleration feature,  using the ports 20,000–20,004 to the RTP protocol and port 80 to the TCP proto- col. In addition, the SIP protocol prioritization was applied on port 5060 and con- figured in the satellite platform.  For  the VoIP  calls  realization  through  IxChariot  tool,  two  PCs  were  used  as  endpoints, from where the voice call was originated and received. Endpoint 1 was  performed on PC1, connected to the UE terminal and Endpoint 2 was executed in  PC2 and connected to the EPC and IxChariot console subnetwork.

Takaki et al.  4   Results Analysis and Discussion  Through  test  realization,  according  to  the  two  scenarios,  the  simulated  and  real  environments,  described  in  the  previous  section,  measurements  were  performed  and results obtained for tests of latency, throughput, MOS, and PESQ. The follow- ing subsections show the obtained results.  4.1   Latency  Round Trip Time—RTT   The  results  of  the  latency  tests  between  the  PC1  and  PC2  are  shown  in  Figs.  7  and 8. These average results were obtained through the ping and speedtest tools,  respectively.  The  ping  tool  used  between  PC1  and  PC2  generating  ICMP  traffic  and providing RTT or latency results.  Comparing  the  graphs  in  Fig.  7a,  b,  it  was  found  that  there  were  no  latency  changes  in  the  simulated  environment,  being  indifferent,  in  this  case,  whether  the  EPC  is  at VSAT  station  side  or  HUB  station  side  and  indifferent  also  with  traffic  direction if it is downlink or uplink. The same happens to the values obtained on the  VSAT side in the real environment, where a latency increase of 108 ms comparing  to the simulated environment is verified. On the other hand, in the case the EPC was   Fig. 7   Downlink and uplink  latency obtained by ping tool.  a Downlink latency values; b  uplink latency values   Integration Between LTE and Satellite Networks  155  Fig. 8   Latency downlink  obtained by speedtest tool  Table 6   Real scenario results with the satellite system integration Configuration EPC next VSAT station  Satellite system optimization No Yes No Yes  Latency—RTT  ms  700 700 750 650  EPC next HUB station  located on the HUB station side, a latency decrease of about approximately 5.3 %  in uplink compared to the value obtained in downlink was observed. The compari- son  between  values  obtained  in  simulated  and  real  scenarios  resulted  in  latency  increases of 169 and 127 ms, in the uplink and downlink, respectively, for the real  scenarios.  Finally,  when  comparing  the  results  obtained  with  different  tools   ping  and speedtest , it was found that the values of latency on the downlink, in the real  environment, obtained with the two tools and shown in Figs. 7a and 8, showed the  greatest difference of approximately 11.4 % when the EPC was located on the HUB  station side. A comparison is made with the case wherein the EPC was located on  the VSAT station side, when the difference was reduced to 0.07 %. It is noteworthy  that the evaluation of latency through speedtest, for the EPC located in the VSAT  station side, is performed without the use of optimizations on the satellite link. On  the other hand, as this optimization was performed as part of the process of latency  measurements for the EPC located next to the HUB station, the difference between  the measured values using the different tools in this configuration can be justified.  Finally,  we  also  emphasize  that,  in  the  conditions  under  which  the  real  satel- lite link test evaluations were made, the comparison between the real environment  scenario and the simulated scenario highlights, in any situation, a latency increase  by 15 % when the EPC is on the VSAT side, and a latency increase from 7 to 17 %  when the EPC is on the HUB side. Regardless of the optimizations in the satellite  system, these higher latency results are due to many factors over which you cannot  have  control  in  the  real  scenario  of  integration,  such  as:  weather  conditions  that  affect the satellite link and the dynamics of suitable band shared among different  VSAT stations found in the satellite link. These factors are not present in the con- trolled  environment  laboratory,  when  using  the  simulator  delay. Table  6  summa- rizes the main results for real scenario of satellite system integration.   156  4.2   Throughput  R. Takaki et al.  The  results   averages   of  throughput  tests  between  PC1  and  PC2  are  shown  in  Figs.  9  and  10.  These  results  were  obtained  through  iperf  and  speedtest  tools,  respectively.  The  iperf  was  used  to  generate  UDP  data  traffic  with  a  fixed  rate  on the downlink direction, i.e., traffic generated from PC2 to PC1 and the uplink  direction,  from  PC1  to  PC2.  The  speedtest  tool  was  used  through  Web  browser  by accessing the server webpage. The Internet connection was set on the side of   Fig. 9   Throughput obtained  through the speedtest tool   downlink   Fig. 10   Throughput  obtained through the iperf  tool. a Downlink throughput  values. b Uplink throughput  values   Integration Between LTE and Satellite Networks  157  Table 7   Throughput efficiency loss in a real scenario Configuration EPC next VSAT station EPC next HUB station  Efficiency  download   %  58 41  Efficiency  upload   %  67 49  the  carrier  or  through  the  HUB  station.  For  the  test  implementation,  maximum  throughput values were set to the satellite link: 8 Mbps downlink and 1 Mbps in  the uplink.  The flow results through the speedtest and iperf tools for the downlink  down- load   are  shown  in  Figs.  9  and  10a,  respectively.  A  throughput  decrease  was  observed  in  the  UDP  traffic  in  the  real  environment   Fig.  9   compared  with  the  simulated  environment.  This  decrease  was  approximately  38  %  for  the  case  wherein the EPC was located on the VSAT side, and 68.5 % when the EPC was  located  on  the  HUB  station  side.  In  the  case  where  the  EPC  was  on  the VSAT  side and using the iperf tool, a drop in the downlink throughput value of the order  of 46.9 % was observed and for the uplink  upload , a drop value of the order of  32 %. For the configuration in which the EPC was on the HUB station side, there  was  a  throughput  value  drop  around  49.2  %  for  downlink  and  51  %  for  uplink.  For  both  throughputs  obtained,  there  was  the  sharpest  drop  in  the  scenario  in  which  EPC  was  located  on  the  HUB  station  side.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  real  environment  incorporates  variable  influences  not  controlled,  such  as  weather  conditions  and  satellite  link  sharing  as  previously  mentioned,  during  the  measurements  performed,  by  other  VSAT  stations.  These  variables  are not present in the controlled laboratory environment, when using the latency  simulator. Likewise the network sharing may explain the variation of the verified  and  obtained  results  using  the  two  tools.  Table  7  shows  the  efficiency  drop  for  the throughput verified in the real satellite system integration scenario with EPC  located at HUB station, with bandwidth upload and download limiting.  4.3   MOS Score  Figure 11 shows obtaining the MOS through the IxChariot tool resulted in MOS  scores  ratings  equivalent  to  “Some  dissatisfied  users”  and  “Many  users  dissatis- fied”  see Table 2  for the simulated test environment, and MOS scores equivalent  to the ratings “Many users dissatisfied” and “Almost all users dissatisfied” in the  real environment.  The  results  of  the  simulated  environment  were  obtained  for  EPC  located  on  both  the  VSAT  station  side  and  HUB  station  side.  These  results  showed  only  0.6 % of difference between these two cases. The results obtained in real environ- ment,  using  the  same  tool,  showed  a  53.8  %  MOS  score  increase  related  to  the  measurement obtained for the EPC located on the VSAT station side when com- paring to the MOS score for the EPC located on the HUB station side. Both score  ratings match “Almost all users dissatisfied” MOS classification.   158  Fig. 11   MOS obtained by  IxChariot tool  R. Takaki et al.  Fig. 12   MOS obtained  in real scenario with the  IxChariot tool and PESQ  algorithm  Figure 12 compares the MOS and PESQ results in the real scenario. The varia- tion in MOS values obtained by IxChariot tool and the PESQ algorithm when the  EPC was located next to the VSAT station and when it was part of the hub station  are, respectively, 37.6 and 53.6 %. The lower values were obtained with the MOS  results. The tests results analysis of the various situations indicate greater PESQ  algorithm  reliability  for  the  real  environment  evaluation.  Note  that  all  evaluated  audio files, regardless of the delay considered in a simulated environment between  0 and 300 ms, showed excellent audio quality. In the real environment an excel- lent  MOS  result  evaluated  by  this  algorithm  in  the  case  EPC  was  located  in  the  VSAT station side was also observed. This result is consistent with the excellent  recording audio quality experienced. In the scenario where the EPC was located  on the HUB station side, a significant occurrence of jitter and delay in voice traffic  due to the control signaling presence and data traveling on the bus satellite, which  may explain the MOS values drop measured in this configuration, was registered.  The  MOS  results’  comparison  between  the  IxChariot  tool  measurement  for  the  perceived audio quality, and the PESQ algorithm used to evaluate recorded calls,  indicated that the first tool  IxChariot  was not properly prepared for voice quality  measurements in systems where the delay is the predominant factor in the degra- dation of real-time services.   Integration Between LTE and Satellite Networks  159  5   Conclusion  This  chapter  presented  the  results  of  performance  measurements  in  a  LTE  wire- less communication network that integrates a GSO system that provides the back- haul for the LTE system, as an access segment to the EPC or an access segment  to  an  operator  services  network  provider.  The  measurements  were  performed  in  two steps, the first one simulating the delay caused by the satellite system in the  laboratory, and the second one, in a real satellite link environment, in real operat- ing conditions. In both steps, LTE radio access  RAN  network components were  used,  that  is,  base  station  and  terminals  prototypes  were  connected  to  the  labo- ratory environment. Results presented in this chapter show the real possibility of  using the LTE system integrated with satellite backhaul, also indicating the impor- tance of optimizations on the satellite segment for this integration to be performed  most  efficiently,  exploiting  the  full  potential  of  access  segment  provided  by  the  LTE  system,  constituted  by  the  RAN  and  the  EPC.  Those  optimizations  should  cover aspects related to both configuration parameters of the LTE system as with  acceleration mechanisms used in satellite networks and the available capacity for  backhaul  reserved  link. The  presented  results  show  the  possibility  through  these  optimizations and band reservations with appropriate Committed Information Rate   CIR ,  to  achieve  latencies  in  one  way,  download  or  upload  below  350  ms,  and  efficiencies greater than 50 and 60 % for the configuration where the EPC is next  to the HUB station or next to the VSAT station and there is provided a dedicated  link. The results showed also the necessity to use tools available to evaluate voice  calls’  quality  performance  subject  to  excessive  delays,  such  as  those  typically  found in geostationary satellite systems. However, even with these limitations, as  reported, it was possible to prove the feasibility, as well as the good quality voice  service to the LTE assessed network integration with the GSO system segment.
