Since the mid-1980s, Oracle has been available  on almost every operating system. With the release of Oracle RDBMS Version 6, you could  develop a database schema on your desktop knowing it could be implemented unchanged on  multiple large-scale platforms. With the release of Oracle7, stored procedures could be written  using PL SQL, and once again, these could be ported to any supported operating system.  Oracle8 brought object orientation, and Oracle8i brought internal support for Java releases represent 15-plus years of demonstrated commitment by Oracle Corporation to make  Oracle the write-once-run-anywhere database. But platform independence alone did not make  Oracle the dominant database in the marketplace. Other factors contributed as well:   Open-systems initiatives    . These   Oracle grew up with Unix and therefore carries an open-systems attitude that has  fostered innovation and acute customer awareness.    Configurable resources    The Oracle RDBMS resources, such as filesystem and memory usage, are configurable  and manageable by the DBA. As a result, an Oracle database can be tuned for the task  at hand, whether that task is transaction processing, batch processing, or decision  support.    Leading technology    Oracle has consistently led the relational database industry technologically. From time to  time, competitors have temporarily leaped ahead of Oracle in a niche, but Oracle has  always retaken the lead.    You may have already guessed that I am an Oracle advocate. I have had 16 years of experience  with Oracle and its competitors, and this alone has taught me to respect the product. A more  telling story is how many developers who have worked with Oracle tell me all the things they miss  when they work with another product.    I got involved with Oracle accidentally. The company I was working for had acquired one of its  competitors, and I was sent to the West Coast to convert the reports from something called a  relational database to COBOL VSAM ISAM programs on a minicomputer. The reason for the  conversion was the poor performance of the acquired company's reports. During the conversion, I  heard all the badmouthing going around at that time about relational technology. My thoughts at  the time were that, performance aside, relational technology greatly simplified decision-support  development. And, had the reports I was converting been done right, performance would not  have been an issue.    After that experience, I felt that eventually, relational database technology would dominate the  development market, so I decided to research the products available and pick the one that I  thought would emerge as the market leader. After several months of research, I decided on  Oracle, which at the time was just in Version 5. Since that time, I have been working with Oracle    and, from time to time, its competitors. Over the years, I have used COBOL, Pro*COBOL, C,  Windows SDK, Pro*C, OCI, C++, Smalltalk, Visual Basic, PowerBuilder, PL SQL, and Java as  client development languages -- all to access an Oracle database. With my varied experience, I  still remember my first mistakes with Oracle -- performing that conversion was the very first.    I have learned more than anything else that the only reason a relational database performs poorly  is because we don't use it like a relational database. On that first project with Oracle, the previous  programmers were performing data processing the slow way: they opened cursors on different  tables and did fetches until they found a match between tables, essentially doing full table scans  and not using the database to perform the joins. There was really no reason to badmouth  relational technology back then, except for our own ignorance. Boy, I sure could have used a  good O'Reilly book on Oracle back when I did that conversion.    While Oracle was growing as the database product of choice, Sun Microsystems released Java in  the mid-1990s. Since that time, Java has gone from being considered an applet language, a  client-side language, a server-side language, an enterprise application language, and now, with  Oracle8i, an object-relational database language. That is so cool. Now we can leverage the  strength of relational technology and object orientation in our enterprise applications on both  client and server. But to leverage this technology to build enterprise applications, we need to  have a solid foundation. That is what this book is all about. Oracle Java DataBase Connectivity   JDBC  is the foundation for all your Java Oracle applications.   Why I Wrote This Book  I am a firm believer that good foundational knowledge is a must if you, as an application  developer, are going to write a robust application. Your knowledge of the fundamentals of the  technologies you're using makes or break not only any application you write, but your  programming career as well. I was extremely pleased to write a book about Oracle JDBC,  because it is the foundation for using Java with Oracle.    This is a book written by a programmer for programmers. I try to include enough detail to get the  novice up and running without boring the experienced programmer to death. My hope is that this  book will guide you through the process of making a connection and executing SQL statements  while maintaining database integrity and enabling you to use all the database technologies  offered by Oracle.   This Book's Intended Audience  This book covers a lot of material about Oracle's implementation of JDBC. It provides both the  beginner and the advanced Oracle or Java user with all the information needed to be successful.  However, a certain amount of basic knowledge about SQL, Java, and object orientation is a must.    I am often asked, "What's the best way for me to learn Oracle?" Wow! Now that's a loaded  question. To learn Oracle is a big task, because Oracle is a big product. But I always respond  with these suggestions:       Go to http:  technet.oracle.com membership  and sign up on the Oracle   Technology Network  OTN, or Technet  as a member. It doesn't cost you anything to  become a member, and you get access to all of the Oracle documentation online. You  also get access to the discussion forums, where others like yourself post questions when  they're having problems. And you can download the most recent Java drivers and other  software for free.       Better yet, sign up for a technology track or two. Technology tracks cost $200 each. For  your $200, you get four updates a year on a CD of all the software for a track. For $400,    you can get either the NT Servers or Linux Servers tracks along with the NT  Development Tools track and have a complete setup for learning Oracle.       Do some serious studying. Read the Oracle Concepts Manual. Then read Oracle: The  Complete Reference, by George Koch and Kevin Loney  Osborne McGraw-Hill . Follow  that with the Oracle Developer's Guide. Then finish your beginner's work by reading  Oracle PL SQL Programming by Steven Feuerstein with Bill Pribyl  O'Reilly . O'Reilly has  several other books on Oracle that you will find helpful. Check them out at  http:  oracle.oreilly.com .        If you have the funding, send yourself to all the Oracle developer classes and a couple of  DBA classes, too -- so you can keep your DBA honest. The DBA classes will also help  you when you try to create your own database in your "learning" environment.    Usually when I offer this advice, I get a response such as: "Gee, that sounds like a lot of work."  True, it is a lot of work, but I've been studying Oracle for 16 years and I still don't know all of it.  How else do you expect to make the big bucks?    As far as Java goes, reading Learning Java by Patrick Niemeyer and Jonathan Knudsen   O'Reilly  is an excellent starting point. O'Reilly has an entire series of books on Java that take  each major area and cover it exhaustively -- for example, Database Programming with JDBC and  Java by George Reese  O'Reilly . George's book covers basics that are not database-specific  while pursuing a more abstract or advanced approach to examining the various ways you can  utilize programming models with JDBC. Check out all the Java series titles at  http:  java.oreilly.com .    If you're into electronic documentation, you can download a copy of the JDBC Java specification  from Sun Microsystems at http:  java.sun.com products jdbc . The standard JDBC API  Javadoc can be found in the doc directory of the JDK you install. If you want a complete JDBC  API Javadoc, you can download a copy of Oracle's JDBC Javadoc at the OTN web site.   Structure of This Book  This book attempts to be both a tutorial and a reference. It's divided into five parts and includes  20 chapters. The material builds upon itself as you go along. So if you skip ahead in any section,  be forewarned that you may have to backtrack. The book is packed with fully functional examples  that demonstrate each concept as it is discussed.   Part I    Introduction to JDBC introduces the JDBC API, defines the term client-server, and  uses that definition to identify four different clients that JDBC programmers may  encounter. These client definitions create a context for the material covered in Part II.    Part II    Part III    Part IV    Chapters 2-7 cover topics related to establishing a connection. While most books cover  this material in a couple of pages, too many developers suffer with the nuances of  establishing a connection under the four different client types not to warrant a more in- depth coverage of the material.    Chapters 8-13 cover topics related to the use of traditional relational SQL. They also  cover the use of large binary objects  LOBs  and batching.    Chapters 14-16 cover topics related to the use of Oracle's object-relational SQL. You will  learn how to work with user-defined database types using JDBC.     Part V    Chapters 17-20 cover topics related to transaction management, data integrity, locking,  detection, and troubleshooting. While not strictly part of JDBC, these are essential topics  that every JDBC programmer should understand.    Conventions Used in This Book  The following typographical conventions are used in this book:  Italic    Used for filenames, directory names, table names, field names, and URLs. It is also used  for emphasis and for the first use of a technical term.    Constant width    Used for examples and to show the contents of files and the output of commands.    Constant width italic    Constant width bold    Used in syntax descriptions to indicate user-defined items.   Indicates user input in examples showing an interaction.   UPPERCASE    lowercase    In syntax descriptions, usually indicates keywords.   In syntax descriptions, usually indicates user-defined items such as variables.    In syntax descriptions, square brackets enclose optional items.   In syntax descriptions, curly brackets enclose a set of items from which you must choose  only one.    In syntax descriptions, a vertical bar separates the items enclosed in curly or square  brackets, as in {TRUE  FALSE}.    [ ]    { }        ...    In syntax descriptions, ellipses indicate repeating elements.    Indicates a tip, suggestion, or general note.               Indicates a warning or caution.   Software and Versions  This book covers Oracle8i, Release 2, Version 8.1.6, which is the first version of Oracle to  support JDBC Version 2.0. Accordingly, the examples used in the book were tested with JDK  Version 1.2.2 and J2EE Version 1.2. Don't be discouraged if you're still using JDK 1.1.x. Most of  the examples, except for some of the J2EE stuff, work fine with JDK 1.1.5+. Even some of the    features that are new to JDBC 2.0, such as prefetching and batching, are supported under JDK  1.1.5+ via an additional Oracle import. All the program examples are available online at  http:  examples.oreilly.com jorajdbc .    Oracle8i, Version 8.1.7, and Oracle9i both introduce new features that represent incremental  improvements to Oracle JDBC. We'll discuss the most important of these new features in  Chapter 20. Even though I used Oracle8i, Version 8.1.6 for all the examples in this book,  everything you read still applies to Oracle8i, Release 3, Version 8.1.7 and to Oracle9i.    Most of the filenames in my examples use the Windows path notation using backslashes instead  of forward slashes. I use this notation not out of preference for a particular operating system  my  preference is Unix , but because I feel most of you will be learning how to use Oracle JDBC on a  Win32 platform. So for you Unix Linux programmers, forgive me for making you reach over the  Enter key.

With this I could not agree more. That said, I never would have been in a position to write  this book had it not been for the profound way in which my wife Diane has taught me how to live.  With her love, honesty, and tireless support, no matter how wacky some of my adventures or  ideas have been, she has always been there as a friend, pointing out that the only limits to my  ability were the ones I imagined. As a writing teacher, her advice has been immensely valuable. I  am truly grateful to have her help and advice. For the last year, while I have been writing this  book, she has pretty much lived without me. Yet she has been my sounding board on many  issues related to the book, and it all must have sounded like I was speaking another language. I  can't express in words how intensely I love her, but having the time to write this book is good  indication of how much she loves me. Thank you Diane!    This book was only half as good as it is now when I first turned my chapters over to my editor  Jonathan Gennick. The other half came from Jonathan's feedback. You can't imagine how  humbling it is to write a chapter of a book, edit yourself several times, send it to your editor, and  then get it returned to you with so many edit marks that it looks like it's the first paper you wrote in  your freshman year of high school. Nonetheless, through the process of editing emerges a work  that is better, better because of the teamwork between writer and editor. Thank you Jonathan!    And thank you also to Matt Hutchinson, production editor for the book, and to the entire O'Reilly  production team.    Also, a special thanks goes out to my technical reviewers: Kuassi Mensah, Java Products Group  Manager, Oracle Corporation; Shiva Prasad, Senior Product Manager, Oracle Corporation;  Ekkehard Rohwedder, SQLJ Development Manager, Oracle Corporation; Alan Beaulieu,  President, APB Solutions, Inc.; and Charles Havranek, President and CEO, xde.net. Your efforts  improved this book and are greatly appreciated!   Part I: Overview   Part I consists of a single chapter that introduces the JDBC API, defines the term  client server as it will be used in the book, and provides a framework of four  different client types. Each of the four client types, which require a different  treatment when establishing a database connection, will be discussed in detail in  Part II.    1.1 The JDBC API  In this section, I will try to give you the big picture of the JDBC API. Given this overview, you'll  have a contextual foundation on which to lay your knowledge as you build it chapter by chapter  while reading this book.    The JDBC API is based mainly on a set of interfaces, not classes. It's up to the manufacturer of  the driver to implement the interfaces with their own set of classes. Figure 1-1 is a class  diagram that shows the basic JDBC classes and interfaces; these make up the core API. Notice  that the only concrete class is DriverManager. The rest of the core API is a set of interfaces.    Figure 1-1. The interfaces of the core JDBC API      I'll take a second to explain some of the relationships in the diagram. DriverManager is used to  load a JDBC Driver. A Driver is a software vendor's implementation of the JDBC API. After a  driver is loaded, DriverManager is used to get a Connection. In turn, a Connection is used  to create a Statement, or to create and prepare a PreparedStatement or  CallableStatement. Statement and PreparedStatement objects are used to execute  SQL statements. CallableStatement objects are used to execute stored procedures. A  Connection can also be used to get a DatabaseMetaData object describing a database's  functionality.    The results of executing a SQL statement using a Statement or PreparedStatement are  returned as a ResultSet. A ResultSet can be used to get the actual returned data or a    ResultSetMetaData object that can be queried to identify the types of data returned in the  ResultSet.    The six interfaces at the bottom of Figure 1-1 are used with object-relational technology. A  Struct is a weakly typed object that represents a database object as a record. A Ref is a  reference to an object in a database. It can be used to get to a database object. An Array is a  weakly typed object that represents a database collection object as an array. The SQLData  interface is implemented by custom classes you write to represent database objects as Java  objects in your application. SQLInput and SQLOutput are used by the Driver in the creation  of your custom classes during retrieval and storage.    In Oracle's implementation of JDBC, most of the JDBC interfaces are implemented by classes  whose names are prefixed with the word Oracle. Figure 1-2 shows these classes and is laid  out so that the classes correspond positionally with those shown in Figure 1-1.    Figure 1-2. Oracle's implementation of the JDBC API interfaces      As you can see from Figure 1-2, the only interface not implemented by an Oracle class is  SQLData. That's because you implement the SQLData interface yourself with custom classes  that you create to mirror database objects. Now that you've got the big picture for the JDBC API,  let's lay a foundation for understanding what I mean when I used the term client with respect to  JDBC.   1.2 Clients  In Part II, we'll examine how to establish JDBC connections from four types of Oracle clients: an  application, an applet, a servlet, and an internal client. But first, I need to define what I mean by  client. Let's begin that discussion by clarifying the term client server.   1.2.1 What Is Client Server?  Over the years, I've heard countless, sometimes convoluted, definitions for the term client server.  This has led to a great deal of confusion when discussing application architecture or platforms.  So you have a consistent definition of the term client server, I propose we use Oracle's early  definition for client server and then define the four different types of clients we'll encounter in this  book.    It's my opinion that Oracle is in large part responsible for the definition and success of the so- called client server platform. From its beginnings, Oracle has been a client server database.  Here's my definition of client server:     Any time two different programs run in two separate operating-system processes  in which one program requests services from the other, you have a client server  relationship.    In the early days, before the use of networks, Oracle applications consisted of the Oracle RDBMS  running on one operating-system process as the server and one or more end users running their  application programs in other operating-system processes. Even though this all took place on one  physical computer, it's still considered client server. The Oracle RDBMS represents the server,  and the end-user application programs represent the clients.    With the use of networks, the communication between the client and server changed, but the  client server relationship remained the same. The key difference was that client and server  programs were moved to different computers. Examples of this are the use of C, C++,  VisualBasic, PowerBuilder, and Developer 2000 to develop applications that run on personal  computers and in turn communicate with an Oracle database on a host computer using TCP IP  via Net8. This type of scenario is what most people think of when they hear the term client server.  I call this type of client server architecture two-tier because the division of labor is a factor of two,  not because the client and server programs run on two different computers.      EJB , client server applications have become   Now, with Java and the Java 2 Enterprise Edition  J2EE , which includes servlets and distributed  objects such as Enterprise JavaBeans multitiered. Such multitier applications, which can have three, four, or even more tiers, are  referred to as n-tier applications  in which n is more than two tiers . For example, someone using  a browser on a PC can execute a servlet on another host computer. The computer on which the  servlet runs is known as an application server, and it in turn might execute EJB on a third host  computer, which would be known as a component server. The component server might contact  yet another server, a database server running Oracle, to retrieve and store data. In this example,  we have four tiers: personal computer, application server, component server, and database  server. Distributing the software over four computers is one means of scaling up an application to  handle a larger volume of transactions.    With respect to the n-tier application, it's possible to deploy that application so the application  server, component server, and database server are all on the same host computer. In such a  scenario, we would still call it an n-tier application because the division of labor among programs  is a factor greater than two. The key point to note is that while we can run all the server software  on the same host computer, the n-tier architecture allows us to distribute the application over  multiple servers if necessary. Did you notice in these last two examples how a server might also  be a client? The servlet running on the application server was the client to the EJB running on the  component server, and so forth.    Now that you have a better understanding of the term client-sever, let's continue by looking at the  different types of clients that utilize JDBC and Oracle.   1.2.2 Types of Clients  As far as application development using Java is concerned, prior to Oracle8i, there were two  types of clients: an application and an applet. Both run in a Java Virtual Machine  JVM , but an  applet runs in a browser, which in turn runs as an application. Typically, an application has liberal  access to operating-system resources, while an applet's access to those resources is restricted  by the browser. I say typically, because using the Java Security API can restrict an application's  access to operating-system resources, and with a signed applet, or security policies, you can gain  access to operating-system resources. Another distinction between applications and applets is  that while an application has a main    method, an applet does not. Yet another distinction is  how they are programmed to connect to the database. Because of these distinctions, it is useful  to consider applications and applets as two different types of clients.     With the coming of J2EE, servlets and EJB both became new types of clients. A servlet, a Java  replacement for a CGI program, is a Java class that runs inside a servlet container similar to how  an applet runs inside a browser. Typically, a servlet takes the input of an HTML form submitted by  a browser and processes the data. A servlet may also generate an HTML form or other dynamic  content. Servlets differ from applications in a couple of ways. Like applets, servlets have no  main    method. There are also differences in how you program a servlet to connect to a  database. More importantly, a servlet is an application component. One or more servlets are  written to create an application.    Moving on to component technology, EJB is a Java component model for creating enterprise  applications. EJB is a software component that runs in a component server, which is usually  referred to as a Component Transaction Monitor or EJB Container. Like applets and servlets, EJB  has special considerations when it comes to connecting to the database and performing  transactions. Therefore, we'll consider EJB as a fourth type of client.    With the release of Oracle8i, Oracle stored procedures could be written in Java and became a  new type of client. Connectivity for Java stored procedures is very simple. Because EJB and Java  stored procedures are both internal clients, we'll consider both of them as the fourth type, an  internal client. In summary, we have defined four different types of clients that may utilize JDBC:       Applications     Applets     Servlets      Internal objects   The important point is that each of these client types has a different set of requirements when it  comes to establishing a connection to the database. An application is the easiest type of client to  connect. That's because it has liberal access to operating-system resources; you typically just  make a connection when you start your program and then close it before you exit. An applet, on  the other hand, has to live with security, life cycle, and routing restrictions. A servlet has life cycle  and possible shared connection issues, and an internal client such as EJB or a stored procedure  has security issues.    It's common for programmers to have problems establishing a JDBC connection to an Oracle  database. Consequently, I'll discuss each type of client's requirements separately, and in detail, in  the chapters that follow. This should get you started on the right foot. Chapter 2 covers most of  the general knowledge you'll need, so even if you're interested only in connecting from applets,  servlets, or internally from Java stored procedures, read Chapter 2 first.   1.3 Using SQL  OK. Get ready. Here's my soapbox speech. A final word before you start. Don't make the mistake  of becoming dependent on a procedural language and forgetting how to use the set-oriented  nature of SQL to solve your programming problems. In other words, make sure you use the full  power of SQL. A common example of this phenomenon is the batch updating of data in a table.  Often, programmers will create a program using a procedural language such as PL SQL or Java,  open a cursor on a table for a given set of criteria, then walk through the result set row by row,  selecting data from another table or tables, and finally updating the original row in the table with  the data. However, all this work can be done more quickly and easily using a simple SQL  UPDATE statement with a single- or multicolumn subquery.    I can't emphasize enough how important it is for you to know the SQL language in order to get  the most from using JDBC. If you don't have a lot of experience using SQL, I suggest you read    SQL in a Nutshell, by Kevin Kline with Daniel Kline  O'Reilly or Oracle: The Complete Reference,  by George Koch and Kevin Loney  Osborne McGraw-Hill .   Part II: Connections   In Part II, we'll look at how to establish database connections within the context  of each one of the four clients defined in Introduction to JDBC:       Applications     Applets     Servlets      Internal objects   As part of our discussion on servlet connections, we'll look at various strategies  for managing pools of connections. Following the chapters on connections, we'll  continue by covering Oracle's advanced security features. Finally, we'll  investigate the JDBC optional package's connection pooling framework.    Chapter 2. Application Database Connections  In Introduction to JDBC, I defined four client types. In this chapter, I'll discuss how to make a  database connection from the first type of client, an application. Establishing a database  connection may sound like an easy task, but it's often not, because you lack the necessary  information. In this chapter, I'll not only explain the ins and outs of making a connection but also  talk about the different types of connections you can make and point out the advantages of each.   2.1 JDBC Drivers  In order to connect a Java application to a database using JDBC, you need to use a JDBC driver.  This driver acts as an intermediary between your application and the database. There are actually  several types of JDBC drivers available, so you need to choose the one that best suits your  particular circumstances. You also need to be aware that not all driver types are supported by  Oracle, and even when a driver type is supported by Oracle, it may not be supported by all  versions of Oracle.   2.1.1 Driver Types  Sun has defined four categories of JDBC drivers. The categories delineate the differences in  architecture for the drivers. One difference between architectures lies in whether a given driver is  implemented in native code or in Java code. By native code, I mean whatever machine code is  supported by a particular hardware configuration. For example, a driver may be written in C and  then compiled to run on a specific hardware platform. Another difference lies in how the driver  makes the actual connection to the database. The four driver types are as follows:   Type 1: JDBC bridge driver    This type uses bridge technology to connect a Java client to a third-party API such as  Oracle DataBase Connectivity  ODBC . Sun's JDBC-ODBC bridge is an example of a  Type 1 driver. These drivers are implemented using native code.    Type 2: Native API  part Java driver      This type of driver wraps a native API with Java classes. The Oracle Call Interface  OCI   driver is an example of a Type 2 driver. Because a Type 2 driver is implemented using  local native code, it is expected to have better performance than a pure Java driver.    Type 3: Network protocol  pure Java driver     This type of driver communicates using a network protocol to a middle-tier server. The  middle tier in turn communicates to the database. Oracle does not provide a Type 3  driver. They do, however, have a program called Connection Manager that, when used in  combination with Oracle's Type 4 driver, acts as a Type 3 driver in many respects.  Connection Manager will be covered in Chapter 3.    Type 4: Native protocol  pure Java driver     This type of driver, written entirely in Java, communicates directly with the database. No  local native code is required. Oracle's Thin driver is an example of a Type 4 driver.    It's a popular notion that drivers implemented using native code are faster than pure Java drivers  because native code is compiled into the native op-code language of the computer, whereas Java  drivers are compiled into byte code. Java drivers have their CPU instructions executed by a Java  Virtual Machine  JVM  that acts as a virtual CPU, which in turn has its commands executed by  the computer's real CPU. On the other hand, the code for native code drivers is executed directly  by the real CPU. Because the JVM represents an additional layer of execution, common sense  would seem to dictate that native code would execute faster. However, as you will see in  Chapter 19, this is not always the case. Most of the time, Oracle's Java driver is faster than its  native driver.   2.1.2 Oracle's JDBC Drivers  Oracle provides Type 2 and Type 4 drivers for both client- and server-side use. Client-side refers  to the use of the driver in an application, applet or servlet, whereas server-side refers to the use  of the driver inside the database. Here's a list of Oracle's JDBC drivers:   JDBC OCI driver    This is a Type 2 driver that uses Oracle's native OCI interface. It's commonly referred to  as the OCI driver. There are actually two separate drivers, one for OCI7  Oracle release  7.3.x  and another for OCI8  Oracle release 8.x . This driver is for client-side use and  requires that the Oracle client software be installed.    JDBC Thin driver    JDBC internal driver    This is a Type 4, 100% pure Java driver for client-side use.    This is a Type 2, native code driver for server-side use with Java code that runs inside  the Oracle8i database's JServer JVM. It's also called the kprb driver.    JDBC server-side Thin driver    This is a Type 4 100% pure Java driver for server-side use with Java code that runs  inside the Oracle8i database's JServer JVM that must also access an external data  source.    Figure 2-1 shows the JDBC driver architecture on the Win32 platform. On the client side are the  JDBC-ODBC bridge  supplied by Sun, not Oracle , the JDBC OCI driver, and the JDBC Thin  driver. All three communicate with the listener process on the server. The difference in  architecture is in the software layers between the JDBC driver and the listener. As you can see  from Figure 2-1, the JDBC Thin driver communicates directly with the listener. The JDBC OCI  driver, on the other hand, must communicate with the OCI native software, which in turn  communicates with the listener. Even more removed from the listener is the JDBC-ODBC Bridge.  The JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver communicates with an ODBC driver. In turn, the ODBC driver    communicates with OCI native software, which in turn finally communicates with the listener. The  fact that the JDBC Thin driver communicates directly with the listener is probably why it performs  just as well as its native-mode counterpart in most cases.    Figure 2-1. Oracle driver architecture      In order to keep things concise, from now on I'll refer to the JDBC OCI driver as the OCI driver  and the JDBC Thin driver as the Thin driver. Whenever we discuss server-side drivers, I'll qualify  the Thin driver as the server-side Thin driver. Otherwise, we're always talking about client-side  drivers.   2.1.3 Guidelines for Choosing a Driver  Given that the drivers have subtle variations in their capabilities and are not applicable to  universal client usage, you must decide ahead of time which driver to use for any given  application. As you progress through this book, you'll learn about the varying capabilities of the  drivers, but for now, here are some guidelines for choosing an appropriate driver for your  applications:   Two-tier client server application    I suggest you use the Thin driver for all two-tier, client server applications. The one  exception is for applications making heavy use of stored procedures. For those, you  should use the OCI driver. Note that this is contrary to Oracle's recommendation. Oracle  recommends that for maximum performance, you always use the OCI driver with two-tier,  client server applications. I disagree with Oracle's recommendation because the  difference in performance between the OCI driver and the Thin driver is nominal in most  instances, yet installing the Oracle client software to support the OCI driver can become  a costly software configuration management issue.    Servlet or applet    I suggest you use the Thin driver for portability when writing servlets and applets. For an  applet, you have no choice but to use the Thin driver. It is a pure Java driver that allows a  direct connection to the database by emulating Net8's protocol on top of Java sockets   TCP IP .    Middle-tier program residing in a database    I suggest you use the server-side internal driver if your program resides in a database  and uses only resources, such as Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB  and stored procedures, in  that database.    Middle-tier program residing in a database, but accessing outside resources     For a middle-tier program such as EJB that resides in an Oracle8i database but requires  access to resources outside of the Oracle8i database in which it resides, use the server- side Thin driver.    2.1.4 Versions   Table 2-1 lists the Oracle JDBC driver versions along with the database versions and JDK  versions supported by each and the driver types that are available for each.   Table 2-1. Oracle drivers and the JDKs they support    Driver  release   Database  version  7.3.4   Database  version  8.0.4   Database  version  8.0.5   Database  version  8.0.6   Database  version  8.1.5   Database  version  8.1.6   JDK  1.0.x   JDK  1.1.x   JDK  1.2.x   Client  side  OCI   Client  side  Thin   Server  side  Thin   Server  side  Internal  7.3.4   8.0.4   8.0.5   8.0.6   8.1.5   8.1.6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            There are a few important issues to consider about the information in Table 2-1:       The server-side internal driver only supports JDK 1.2.x.     Beginning with driver Version 8.1.6, JDK 1.0.x is no longer supported.     Also beginning with Version 8.1.6, the OCI driver uses the standard Java Native Interface   JNI . This means you can now use the OCI drivers with JVMs other than Sun's. Prior to  8.1.6, the OCI driver used an earlier native call specification named Native Method  Interface  NMI . This prevented the use of OCI drivers with non-Sun JVMs.    As you can see by examining Table 2-1, Oracle supports JDBC for database versions 7.3.4  through 8.1.6. Each new release of the driver software maintains backward compatibility with  earlier versions of the database. In addition, as long as you don't try to use newer functionality  with an older driver release, you can use an older driver release with a newer version of the  database. For example, you can use the 7.3.4 driver to access an 8.1.6 database, as long as you  don't try to use features that did not exist in the 7.3.4 version of the database. This can be a  handy workaround when planning the migration of a large application. Let's say you had an  application that you migrated from database Version 7.3.4 to 8.1.6. You could continue to use the  7.3.4 driver in the client until you start utilizing features, such as object views, that are specific to  database Version 8.1.6. However, I still recommend you use the newest drivers whenever  possible.   2.1.5 Oracle Class Files  Each Oracle client software release has its own set of class files stored in a zip format:  classes102.zip for use with JDK1.0.x, classes111.zip and nls_charset11.zip for use with JDK    1.1.x, and classes12.zip and nls_charset12.zip for use with JDK 1.2.x. From here on I'll refer to  these sets of class files as classesXXX.zip.   2.2 Installation  Installing the JDBC drivers varies depending on whether you use the OCI driver or the Thin  driver. Let's start with the OCI driver installation.   2.2.1 Installing the OCI Driver  To install the OCI driver software, follow these steps:    1.   Install the Oracle client software from its distribution CD.    2.  Add the appropriate classesXXX.zip file to your CLASSPATH environment variable.    3.   If you are using Java 2 Enterprise Edition  J2EE , add the appropriate classesXXX.zip file  to your J2EE_CLASSPATH environment variable.    4.  Add the client binaries to your PATH environment variable.   5.  On Unix or Linux, add the client binaries to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment   variable.    2.2.1.1 Install the Oracle Client   If you are going to use the OCI driver, you'll need the Oracle8i Oracle Client distribution media or  the Oracle Enterprise Edition distribution media  typically, these are on CD-ROM  to install the  client software. Follow your operating-system-specific instructions to execute the Oracle  Universal Installer. Then simply follow the installation instructions from the Oracle Universal  Installer's screen.    The Oracle Universal Installer creates several directories during the installation of the client  software on your computer. The directories of interest to you are all under ORACLE_HOME\jdbc.  ORACLE_HOME refers to the directory where the Oracle client software was installed. Typically,  these directories are:   demo samples    Contains Oracle's sample programs, demonstrating the use of SQL92 and Oracle SQL  syntax, PL SQL blocks, streams, objects  user-defined types and extensions , and  performance extensions.    doc    lib    Contains the API documentation for the JDBC drivers.   Contains the following classesXXX.zip files:    classes111.zip    classes12.zip    For JDK 1.1.x support   For JDB 1.2.x support   nls_charset11.zip and nls_charset12.zip   For National Language support   jta.zip     For the Java Transaction API   jndi.zip    For the Java Naming and Directory Interface API   The files jta.zip and jndi.zip are part of the standard JDK, but Oracle recommends you use those  included in the lib directory  and those that Oracle distributes  for compatibility with Oracle  classes in the classesXXX.zip file.    The content in these directories varies with the version of JDBC drivers installed. The preceding  directories and files are from Version 8.1.6.    2.2.1.2 Setting environment variables   After the client software installation, add the name of the appropriate classesXXX.zip file to your  CLASSPATH environment variable setting. If you are using J2EE, also add the appropriate  classesXXX.zip file to your J2EE_CLASSPATH setting. Be sure to specify only one  classesXXX.zip file; otherwise, you will encounter unexpected behavior and errors. For example,  if your Oracle Client software is installed on Microsoft Windows NT in the C:\Oracle\Ora81\  directory, then you need to add the following file to your CLASSPATH and J2EE_CLASSPATH  environment variables:   c:\oracle\ora81\jdbc\lib\classes12.zip;  In addition, you also need to add the Oracle Client binaries to your PATH. For example, if your  Oracle Client software is installed on Windows NT in C:\Oracle\Ora81\, then you need to add the  following to your PATH statement:   c:\oracle\ora81\bin;  For Unix, you need to add the Oracle Client binaries to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting. For  example, if your Oracle Client software is installed in  u01 app oracle product 8.1.6, then you  need to add the following to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting:    u01 app oracle product 8.1.6 lib:   2.2.2 Installing the Thin Driver  To install the Thin driver software, follow these steps:    1.   Install the Oracle Thin driver from the Oracle client distribution CD.    2.  Add the appropriate classesXXX.zip file to your CLASSPATH environment variable.    3.   If you are using Java 2 Enterprise Edition  J2EE , add the appropriate classesXXX.zip file  to your J2EE_CLASSPATH environment variable.    2.2.2.1 Install the Thin driver class files   If you are going to use the Thin driver, you can use the Oracle Universal Installer as I specified for  the OCI driver, but this time select only the appropriate Thin driver for installation. Alternatively,  you can simply locate the appropriate classesXXX.zip file on the distribution media and copy it to  an appropriate location on your computer. Then add the desired classesXXX.zip file to your  CLASSPATH and J2EE_CLASSPATH settings. Once again, be sure to specify only one  classesXXX.zip file; otherwise, you will encounter unexpected behavior and errors.    You can also obtain the Thin driver, and an updated version of the OCI driver, via the Oracle  Technology Network  OTN  at:  http:  technet.oracle.com software tech java sqlj_jdbc software_index.htm. To get  access to the drivers you must be an OTN member. Membership is free, and there is a wealth of  valuable information available, such as documentation, discussion forums, and technology tracks    that allow you as a developer to get a developer copy of all the software for a particular operating  system for about $200 year. I encourage you to take advantage of this resource.    Be aware, however, that while the OCI driver updates are available at OTN, the rest of the OCI  client software is not. You must get this by installing the client software from your distribution  media. Further, if you get a newer classesXXX.zip file, say for 8.1.6, you can use it only with  Version 8.1.6 client software. The Java class files must match the version of the client software.  Many problems flood the JDBC forum about this issue. Of course, you can avoid this problem by  using the Thin driver, which does not use any client software.    2.2.2.2 Setting environment variables   After you've installed the Thin driver, or copied its classesXXX.zip file to an appropriate directory,  you'll need to set several environment variables. Add the desired classesXXX.zip file to your  CLASSPATH and J2EE_CLASSPATH settings. For example, if you copied the classes12.zip file  to  u01 app oracle product 8.1.6 jdbc lib on Unix, then you need to add the following to your  CLASSPATH and J2EE_CLASSPATH environment variables:    u01 app oracle product 8.1.6 jdbc lib classes12.zip;   2.2.3 Using Sun's JDBC-ODBC Bridge  This discussion on installation would not be complete if I did not at least acknowledge Sun's  JDBC-ODBC Bridge. If you are going to use the Bridge, then you'll have to install the Oracle  Client and ODBC software, because the Oracle ODBC drivers use the OCI software.   2.3 Connecting to a Database  After you've installed the appropriate driver, it's time to get down to some programming and learn  how to establish a database connection using JDBC. The programming involved to establish a  JDBC connection is fairly simple. Here are the steps to follow:    1.  Add import statements to your Java program so the compiler will know where to find the   classes you'll be using in your Java code.    2.  Register your JDBC driver. This step causes the JVM to load the desired driver   implementation into memory so it can fulfill your JDBC requests.    3.  Formulate a database URL. That is, create a properly formatted address that points to   the database to which you wish to connect.    4.  Code a call to the DriverManager object's getConnection    method to establish a   database connection.   2.3.1 Package Imports  Import statements tell the Java compiler where to find the classes you reference in your code  and are placed at the very beginning of your source code. To use the standard JDBC package,  which allows you to select, insert, update, and delete data in SQL tables, add the following  imports to your source code:   import java.sql.* ;             for standard JDBC programs   import java.math.* ;            for BigDecimal and BigInteger support   If you need to use JDK 1.1.x, you can still get most of Oracle's JDBC 2.0 features by including the  following import statement in your program:   import oracle.jdbc2.*           for Oracle interfaces equivalent to                                   JDBC 2.0 standard package for JDK 1.1.x     Keep in mind, however, that when you do start using JDK 1.2.x or higher you'll have to modify  your code and remove this import statement.    Without the imports shown here you'll have to explicitly identify each class file with its full  package path and name. For example, with imports, you'll normally write the following code to  create a connection object:   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection    "jdbc:oracle:thin:@esales:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;   Without imports, however, you'll have to type the following longer statement instead:   java.sql.Connection conn = java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection     "jdbc:oracle:thin:@esales:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;   As you might expect, Oracle provides a number of extensions to the JDBC standard. These  extensions support the use of Oracle-specific database features such as the methods to write  database object types. To use Oracle's extended functionality, add the following imports to your  source code:   import oracle.sql.* ;           for Oracle type extensions   import oracle.jdbc.driver.*;    for Oracle database access and updates                                   in Oracle type formats   Now that you have your last bit of housekeeping done, you can move on to registering the  appropriate driver in order to establish a JDBC connection.   2.3.2 Registering a JDBC Driver  You must register the Oracle driver, oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver, in your program  before you use it. At this point, you may be confused because we've been talking about the OCI  and Thin drivers, but now we refer only to one class when registering. That's because the same  class file implements both drivers.    Registering the driver is the process by which the Oracle driver's class file is loaded into memory  so it can be utilized as an implementation of the JDBC interfaces. You need to do this only once  in your program. You can register a driver in one of three ways. The most common approach is to  use Java's Class.forName    method to dynamically load the driver's class file into memory,  which automatically registers it. This method is preferable because it allows you to make the  driver registration configurable and portable. The following example uses Class.forName    to  register the Oracle driver:   try {    Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;  }  catch ClassNotFoundException e  {    System.out.println "Oops! Can't find class  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;    System.exit 1 ;  }  The second approach you can use to register a driver is to use the static  DriverManager.registerDriver    method. Use the registerDriver    method if you  are using a non-JDK compliant JVM, such as the one provided by Microsoft. For example:   try {    DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver     ;   }  catch SQLException e  {    System.out.println "Oops! Got a SQL error: " + e.getMessage     ;    System.exit 1 ;    }  The third approach is to use a combination of Class.forName    to dynamically load the  Oracle driver and then the driver classes' getInstance    method to work around  noncompliant JVMs, but then you'll have to code for two extra Exceptions. To call the  getInstance    method for the dynamically loaded class, you can code the call as  Class.forName  .newInstance   :   try {    Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" .newInstance    ;   }  catch ClassNotFoundException e  {    System.out.println "Oops! Can't find class  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;    System.exit 1 ;  }  catch IllegalAccessException e  {    System.out.println "Uh Oh! You can't load  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;    System.exit 2 ;  }  catch InstantiationException e  {    System.out.println "Geez! Can't instantiate  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;    System.exit 3 ;  }  2.3.3 Formulating a Database URL  After you've loaded the driver, you can establish a connection using the  DriverManager.getConnection    method. This method is overloaded and therefore has  various forms. However, each form requires a database URL. A database URL is an address that  points to your database. Formulating a database URL is where most of the problems associated  with establishing a connection occur. For Oracle, the database URL has the following general  form:   jdbc:oracle:driver:@database      database ::= {host:port:sid  net_service_name  connect_descriptor}   which breaks down as:  driver    Specifies the type of JDBC driver to use for the connection. The following choices are  available:    oci7    oci8    oci    thin    kprb    For the Oracle 7.3.4 OCI driver   For an Oracle 8.x.x OCI driver   For an Oracle 9.x.x OCI driver   For the Oracle Thin driver    For the Oracle internal driver   database    host:port:sid    Specifies the database to which you want to connect. You can specify a host, port, and  SID; a net service name; or a connect descriptor.    Used only with the Thin driver and identifies the target database using the following  information:    The TCP IP address or DNS alias  hostname  for your database server   host    port    sid    The TCP IP port number of the Oracle listener   The System Identifier of your database   net_service_name    Used only with the OCI driver. A net service name, or tnsnames.ora file entry as it is  commonly known, is a short name that resolves to a connect descriptor, which is a  specially formatted Net8 database address. Net service names are often resolved via a  local file named tnsnames.ora but may also be resolved using centralized methods such  as Oracle Names. The OCI driver depends on the Oracle Client software to be able to  resolve a net service name. That's why net service names are used only with the OCI  driver.    connect_descriptor    Can be used by either driver and is a Net8 address specification such as that normally  found in a tnsnames.ora file.    Now that you know the rules of how to formulate a database URL, let's look at several examples  as we explore the overloaded forms of the getConnection    method.   2.3.3.1 Using a database URL with a username and password   The most commonly used form of getConnection    requires you to pass a database URL, a  username, and a password:   DriverManager.getConnection String url, String user, String password    When using the Thin driver, you'll specify a host:port:sid value for the database portion of the  URL. For example, if you have a host at TCP IP address 192.0.0.1 with a host name of esales,  and your Oracle listener is configured to listen on port 1521, and your database system identifier  is orcl, then the database portion of the URL would look like:   esales:1521:orcl  The corresponding complete database URL would then be:  jdbc:oracle:thin:@esales:1521:orcl  When you call the getConnection    method, it returns a Connection object. For example:   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection     "jdbc:oracle:thin:@esales:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger"  ;   You'll use this Connection object later to create other objects that will allow you to insert,  update, delete, and select data.     When using the OCI driver, you'll specify a net service name for the database portion of the URL.  For example, if your net service name was esales, your call to create a connection would look  like:   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection     "jdbc:oracle:oci8:@esales", "scott", "tiger"  ;      Net service names such as esales are often defined in a  tnsnames.ora file. The typical locations for tnsnames.ora are  $Oracle Home\network\admin  Windows  and  var opt oracle   Unix . Consult with your DBA if you have any doubts as to  how net service names are resolved.       You can also use the rather obscure  that is, to a programmer  Net8 connect descriptor for the  database portion of the URL. You may be familiar with connect descriptors because they are  used in the tnsnames.ora file for an OCI client to define the specific address details for a net  service name. Using a connect descriptor, our getConnection    example would look like:   Connection conn = getConnection     "jdbc:oracle:thin:@ description= address= host=esales       protocol=tcp  port=1521   connect_data= sid=orcl   ",      "scott", "tiger"  ;  You can use a connect descriptor with either driver, OCI or Thin. More information on Net8 can  be found in Oracle's Net8 Administrator's Guide, which is available on the OTN web site, or in  Oracle Net8 Configuration and Troubleshooting, by Hugo Toledo and Jonathan Gennick   O'Reilly .    2.3.3.2 Using only a database URL    A second form of the DriverManager.getConnection    method requires only a database  URL:   DriverManager.getConnection String url   However, in this case, the database URL includes the username and password and has the  following general form:   jdbc:oracle:driver:username password@database  For example, to make the same database connection using the Thin driver, as in the previous  section's examples, use the following method call:   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection     "jdbc:oracle:thin:scott tiger@esales:1521:orcl"  ;  2.3.3.3 Using a database URL and a Properties object    A third form of the DriverManager.getConnection    method requires a database URL and  a Properties object:   DriverManager.getConnection String url, Properties info    A Properties object holds a set of keyword-value pairs. It's used to pass driver properties to  the driver during a call to the getConnection    method. To make the same connection made  by the previous examples, use the following code:   import java.util.*;    Properties info = new Properties    ;  info.put  "user", "scott"  ;    info.put  "password", "tiger"  ;    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection     "jdbc:oracle:thin:@esales:1521:orcl", info  ;  In this example, a new Properties object is created. It is then populated with two properties,  user and password. The Properties object, named info in this example, is then passed  along with the database URL in the call to the getConnection    method.    Besides user and password, there are a number of other properties you can set in a  Properties object. Table 2-2 shows the connection properties recognized by the Oracle JDBC  drivers. Each property has a full name and may also have a short name. You can use either  name with a Properties object's put method.    Table 2-2. Oracle driver properties    Name   Short name  Type   Description   user    password    database    internal_login               String The Oracle username.   String The Oracle password.   server   String The Oracle database URL.   String   A username, such as sysdba, that allows you to  log onto the database as "internal". This property  applies only to the OCI driver.    defaultRowPrefetch prefetch  String The default number of rows to prefetch from the   server  default = 10 .   remarksReporting   remarks   String   A property that allows you to include database  comments in the database's metadata. Oracle lets  you add comments to both tables and columns. Set  this property to "true" to have the getTables     and getColumns    methods report remarks   default = "false"  .    defaultBatchValue   batchvalue String The default batch value that triggers an execution   request  default = 10  .    includeSynonyms    synonyms  String   A property that allows you to include database  synonyms in the database's metadata. Set this  property to "true" to enable the use of synonyms  with a call to DatabaseMetaData.get- Columns      default = "false"  .    The last six properties in Table 2-2 are Oracle extensions. Normally, only user and password  are passed in the Properties object.   2.3.3.4 Mistakes to watch for    The most common mistake made when establishing a connection is the omission of a colon  : ,  at-sign  @ , or a slash character     in the database URL. So double-check your typing of the  database URL should you have any connection problems.    If you have Oracle installed on the same machine as your JDBC program, you can specify the  default database using just an at-sign with no database string. For example, a database URL  using the oci8 driver would look like this:   jdbc:oracle:oci8:@  The following example shows the DriverManager object's getConnection String url,  String user, String password  form of getConnection    being used to connect to  the default database using scott as the username and tiger as the password:   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection      "jdbc:oracle:thin:@", "scott", "tiger"  ;      Note that there's one exception to Oracle's standard  implementation of the JDBC driver. The Oracle JDBC driver  does not implement the setLoginTimeout    method,  which allows your login attempt to timeout after a specified  length of time.       2.3.4 Application Examples  In this section, I show simple examples of programs that connect to an Oracle database. These  programs are terse to ensure that when you run them, there is no possible problem with the  program itself. Any errors that occur should only be as a result of your connection parameters.  The programs don't include any exception handling code. Instead, they let the JVM handle any  exceptions that occur by printing a stack trace. I'll cover exceptions shortly in Section 2.4.    As you read over these examples, keep in mind that when you use the DriverManager object's  getConnection    method with the oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver object, what the  method actually returns is an OracleConnection object. A JDBC Connection is an interface  that defines a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that states it. The class  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleConnection implements java.sql.Connection, providing  you with all the standard JDBC methods plus the Oracle extensions.    2.3.4.1 An OCI driver example   Example 2-1 tests the OCI driver. Typically, in a client server application, the user logs into the  database when the application is first launched and then logs out when the application is  terminated. This example follows that model. First, the program imports the JDBC library  java.sql.*. Next, it uses the Class.forName    method to load and register the Oracle  driver. Then, it establishes a connection using the getConnection String url, String  user, String password  method. Finally, just to prove that the connection has been  established, the program creates a SQL statement and executes it. It does this using the  Statement and ResultSet objects, which I'll discuss in detail beginning in Chapter 9.   Example 2-1. A test of the OCI driver for an application   import java.sql.*;    class TestOCIApp {      public static void main String args[]         throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {        Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;          or you can use:         DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver. OracleDriver      ;        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection        "jdbc:oracle:oci8:@dssora01.dss","scott","tiger" ;            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;      ResultSet rset = stmt.executeQuery        "select 'Hello OCI driver tester 'USER'!' result from dual" ;      while rset.next              System.out.println rset.getString 1  ;      rset.close    ;      stmt.close    ;      conn.close    ;    }  }  For this example to work, the following conditions must be met:      You must have the Oracle8i client installed.     The Oracle classes12.zip file must be listed in your CLASSPATH.      You must have JDK 1.2.x or higher installed.     You must have access to an Oracle8i  or higher  database.    To compile the program, type the code into a file named TestOCIApp.java  remember, Java is  case-sensitive . Be sure to change the database, username, and password to values that will  work in your environment. Then, to compile and execute the program, type the commands shown  in the following example:   c:\> javac TestOCIApp.java  c:\> java TestOCIApp  Hello OCI driver tester SCOTT!  You should get the short message shown in the example as your output. However, there are a  couple of things that can go wrong that will result in an error message and stack trace being  displayed instead. For example, you might get an error message such as the following:   Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:  oracle.jdbc.driver.  OracleDriver          at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run URLClassLoader.java:202            at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged Native Method           at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass URLClassLoader.java:191            at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass ClassLoader.java:290            at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass Launcher.java:28 6           at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass ClassLoader.java:247            at java.lang.Class.forName0 Native Method           at java.lang.Class.forName Class.java:124           at TestOCIApp.main TestOCIApp.java, Compiled Code    This error message indicates that your CLASSPATH setting is probably missing the Oracle JDBC  classes file. When looking at a stack trace such as this, you can usually identify the problem by  looking at the error message in the first line. In this case, note the ClassNotFoundException    and the associated reference to oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver. The rest of the output  is a backtrace that shows Java method calls in reverse order. See Section 2.4 later in this  chapter for information on reading stack traces.    You can correct the problem with the CLASSPATH setting by adding your Oracle JDBC classes  file to your CLASSPATH environment variable. For example, if your Oracle JDBC classes file is  located in c:\oracle\ora81\jdbc\lib\classes12.zip, then your CLASSPATH environment variable  should look something like this:   CLASSPATH=c:\oracle\ora81\jdbc\lib\classes12.zip;  Even worse than the CLASSPATH error is the one indicated by the following message:   Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError:  C:\Oracle\Ora81\BIN\  ocijdbc8.dll:  One of the library files needed to run this application  cannot be found          at java.lang.ClassLoader$NativeLibrary.load Native Method            at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0 ClassLoader.java:1319           at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary ClassLoader.java:1243            at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0 Runtime.java:470            at java.lang.System.loadLibrary System.java:778            at oracle.jdbc.oci8.OCIDBAccess.logon OCIDBAccess.java:208           at  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleConnection.  OracleConnection.java:198            at oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver.getConnectionInstance            OracleDriver.java:251           at  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver.connect OracleDriver.java:224           at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection DriverManager.java:457            at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection DriverManager.java:137            at TestOCIApp.main TestOCIApp.java, Compiled Code    This error indicates that you have a mismatch between your JDBC classes file and your Oracle  client version. The giveaway here is the message stating that a needed library file cannot be  found. For example, you may be using a classes12.zip file from Oracle Version 8.1.6 with a  Version 8.1.5 Oracle client. The classeXXXs.zip file and Oracle client software versions must  match.       Note that my example programs explicitly close the  ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects. That's  because the Oracle implementation of JDBC does not have  finalizer methods. If you don't explicitly close your Oracle  JDBC resources, you will run out of database connections,  cursors, and or memory. So remember to always close your  Oracle JDBC resources! This is contrary to what you may  read about other implementations of JDBC.       2.3.4.2 A Thin driver example   The second example program, Example 2-2, is just like the first except that it tests the Thin  driver. You'll notice that the only significant changes are the use of the word thin in the  database URL instead of oci8 and the use of the host:port:sid syntax instead of a net  service name.    Example 2-2. A test of the Thin driver for an application     import java.sql.*;    class TestThinApp {      public static void main  String args[]       throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {        Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver"  ;         or you can use:         DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection        "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssnt01:1521:dssora01","scott","tiger" ;         Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;      ResultSet rset = stmt.executeQuery        "select 'Hello Thin driver tester 'USER'!' result from dual" ;       while rset.next              System.out.println rset.getString 1  ;      rset.close    ;      stmt.close    ;      conn.close    ;    }  }  For this example to work, the following conditions must be met:      You must have the Oracle classes12.zip file listed in your CLASSPATH.      You must have JDK 1.2.x or higher installed.      You must have access to an Oracle8i  or higher  database.    To compile the program, type the code into a file named TestThinApp.java. Change the database,  in the form host:port:sid, the username, and the password to appropriate values for your  environment. Then type the commands shown in the following example to compile and run the  program:   C:\> javac TestThinApp.java  C:\> java TestThinApp  Hello Thin driver tester SCOTT!  If you did everything correctly, you should get the "Hello" message shown here when you run the  program. Did you also notice that it takes less time for the Thin driver to establish a connection to  the database than was required for the OCI driver? I'll talk about why that is in Chapter 19.    If you entered an invalid username or password, you may have received output such as the  following when you ran the program:   Exception in thread "main" java.sql.SQLException: ORA -01017: invalid   username password; logon denied          at oracle.jdbc.ttc7.TTIoer.processError TTIoer.java            at oracle.jdbc.ttc7.O3log.receive2nd O3log.java, Compiled Code            at oracle.jdbc.ttc7.TTC7Protocol.logon TTC7Protocol.java            at  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleConnection.  OracleConnection.java            at oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver.getConnectionInstance           OracleDriver.java             at oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver.connect OracleDriver.java            at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection DriverManager.java:457            at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection DriverManager.java:13 7           at TestThinApp.main TestThinApp.java, Compiled Code    By examining this exception, specifically the first line, you can see that the error was indeed  caused by specifying an invalid username or password. Seeing that it is highly probable that a  user will make a mistake entering his username or password, you'll want to catch this error and  react appropriately, possibly giving him another chance to enter his username and password. To  do that, you'll need to know how to handle exceptions.   2.4 Handling Exceptions  If you're a PL SQL programmer, then the concept of exceptions will not be all that new to you. If  you're new to Java and have not previously used a programming language that uses exception  handling, then this material may get confusing. Hang in there! By the time we're done, you should  have a fairly good idea of what exceptions are and how to deal with them in your JDBC programs.   2.4.1 Java Exception Handling  In Java, exception handling allows you to handle exceptional conditions such as program-defined  errors in a controlled fashion. When an exception condition occurs, an exception is thrown. The  term thrown means that current program execution stops, and control is redirected to the nearest  applicable catch clause. If no applicable catch clause exists, then the program's execution ends.    2.4.1.1 Try blocks   Both the JVM and you -- explicitly in your own code -- can throw an exception. Java uses a try- catch-finally control block similar to PL SQL's BEGIN-EXCEPTION-END block. The try  statement encloses a block of code that is "risky" -- in other words, which can throw an exception  -- and that you wish to handle in such a way as to maintain control of the program in the event  that an exception is thrown. Exceptions thrown in a try block are handled by a catch clause  coded to catch an exception of its type or one of its ancestors. For example, when using JDBC,  the exception type thrown is usually a SQLException.    A try statement can have any number of catch clauses necessary to handle the different types  of exceptions that can occur within the try block. A try block can also have a finally clause.  The finally clause is always executed before control leaves the try block but after the first  applicable catch clause. Here is the general form of a try block:   try {      Your risky code goes between these curly braces!!!   }  catch Exception e  {      Your exception handling code goes between these curly braces,        similar to the exception clause in a PL SQL block.   }  finally {      Your must-always-be-executed code goes between these curly braces.  }  You need to have at least a catch or a finally clause, or both, after a try statement.    An Exception object, or Throwable, is passed in the catch clause. By using this Exception  object, or a subclass of it, you can find out additional information about what caused the  exception to occur and deal with it appropriately. For example, if you use an object variable that is  null  i.e., it does not hold an object reference , your program will throw a    NullPointerException. By utilizing a try block, you can capture this error, communicate the  problem to the program user in a meaningful way, and exit your program gracefully. If you don't  capture the exception, the exception will cause a stack trace to print, and the program will abort.    2.4.1.2 Try block nesting behavior   Just as PL SQL blocks can be nested, so can try blocks. This means that if your nested try  block does not handle a particular exception, that exception will propagate to the next level. If an  exception is not handled at all, then the JVM handles it by printing a stack trace and aborting the  program. Look, for example, at the following code:   Date      startDate = null;  Long      personId  = null;  Statement stmt1     = null;  Statement stmt2     = null;  String    firstName = null;  String    lastName  = null;  ResultSet rset1     = null;  ResultSet rset2     = null;    try {    try block level 1    stmt1 = conn.createStatement    ;    rset1 = stmt1.executeQuery      "select person_id, last_name, first_name " +      "from   person" ;    while rset1.next      {      personId  = new Long rset1.getLong 1  ;      lastName  = rset1.getString 2 ;      firstName = rset1.getString 3 ;    }    try {    try block level 2      stmt2 = conn.createStatement    ;      rset2 = stmt2.executeQuery        "select p.start_date, p.end_date, l.name " +        "from   person_location p, location l " +        "where  p.location_id = l.location_id " +        "and    p.person_id   = " + personId.toString     ;       while rset2.next      {        startDate = rset2.getDate 1 ;        endDate   = rset2.getDate 2 ;        name      = rset2.getString 3 ;        if  new SimpleDateFormat "yyyy" .format endDate .equals "2000"   {              ... output some data        }      }      rset2.close    ;      rset2 = null;      stmt2.close    ;      stmt2 = null;    }    catch SQLException e2  {      System.err.println "SQLException in the inner loop!" ;     }    end of try block 2      rset1.close    ;    rset1 = null;    stmt1.close    ;      stmt1 = null;  }  catch SQLException e1  {    System.err.println "SQLException in the outer loop!" ;  }    part of try block 1  catch NullPointerException  {    System.err.println "NullPointerException in outer loop!" ;   }    end of try block 1  finally {    if  rset2 != null        try {rset2.close    ;} catch SQLException ignore  {}    if  stmt2 != null        try {stmt2.close    ;} catch SQLException ignore  {}     if  rset1 != null        try {rset1.close    ;} catch SQLException ignore  {}     if  stmt1 != null        try {stmt1.close    ;} catch SQLException ignore  {}   }  When the if statement in the second, nested try block tests to see if the end date for a location  assignment was in the year 2000, and it encounters an end date that is NULL in the database, it  throws a NullPointerException. The second try block does not handle this exception, so  the exception will propagate outwards to the first try block. A catch clause in the first try block  does handle the exception, so it won't propagate any further than that. After the exception is  handled by the first try block, that block's finally clause will be executed, and the program  will then terminate normally.   2.4.2 SQLException Methods  For JDBC, the most common exception you'll deal with is java.sql.SQLException. A  SQLException can occur both in the driver and the database. When such an exception occurs,  an object of type SQLException will be passed to the catch clause. The passed  SQLException object has the following methods available for retrieving additional information  about the exception:   getErrorCode       Gets the Oracle error number associated with the exception.   getMessage       getSQLState       getNextException       printStackTrace       Gets the JDBC driver's error message for an error handled by the driver or gets the  Oracle error number and message for a database error.    Gets the XOPEN SQLstate string. For a JDBC driver error, no useful information is  returned from this method. For a database error, the five-digit XOPEN SQLstate code is  returned. This method can return null, so you should program accordingly.    Gets the next Exception object in the exception chain.    Prints the current exception, or throwable, and its backtrace to a standard error stream.    printStackTrace PrintStream   s       printStackTrace PrintWriter   w       Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the print stream you specify.     Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the print writer you specify.    By utilizing the information available from the Exception object, you can catch an exception and  continue your program appropriately. Take, for example, our problem with the invalid username  or password. If getErrorCode    returns 1017, you know that the problem is an invalid  username or password and can modify your program to ask the user to respecify her username  and password. It is important for you to know how to handle exceptions because sometimes they  are the only means of program control, as is the case with our previous example. You can find a  complete listing of Oracle8i database error codes, messages, and a diagnostic in the Oracle8i  Error Messages manual available at OTN.    Now that we have covered the basics of establishing a connection to an Oracle database, let's  examine issues specific to connecting to a database from an applet.   Chapter 3. Applet Database Connections  In this chapter, we'll explore issues that are specific to using JDBC with applets. We'll begin by  asking the question: "What type of JDBC driver supports an applet, and for which versions of the  JDK?" Then we'll talk about other things you need to know, such as the life cycle of an applet,  when to open and close a database connection, how to package an applet that uses Oracle  JDBC classes, how to deal with the restrictions placed on JDBC connections by the secure  environment of your browser's JVM, and how to connect through a firewall.   3.1 Oracle Drivers and JDK Versions  For applets, you have only one driver choice: the client-side Thin driver. Since it's a 100% pure  Java driver, you can package it with your applet's archive so it's downloaded by the browser  along with your applet. I'll discuss how to package the Thin driver with your applet later in this  chapter. For now, just keep in mind as we go along that you'll need to package the appropriate  classesXXX.zip file with your applet, and you'll be using the Thin database URL syntax discussed  in Chapter 2.    As of Oracle8i Version 8.1.6, JDK 1.0.x is no longer supported by Oracle. Instead, Oracle8i now  supports only JDK Versions 1.1.x and 1.2.x. Table 3-1 lists the support files you need to  package with your applet to support each of these versions.    Table 3-1. JDBC support files    JDK version   JDBC classes   National Language Support classes   JDK 1.1.x   JDK 1.2.x   classes111.zip   nls_charset11.zip   classes12.zip   nls_charset12.zip   In addition to matching up your applet with the correct support files for the JDK version with which  you are developing, you must also make sure that the browser you're targeting  i.e., on which you  intend to run your applet  supports the same JDK that you are using to develop the applet.  Currently, you either need to use JDK 1.1.x or need to depend on your end users having the Java  2 browser plug-in installed in their browsers. Without that plug-in, the currently predominant  versions of both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator support only JDK 1.1.x. The newest  versions of these browsers, such as Netscape Navigator 6 and other browsers programmed  using Java, support JDK 1.2.x or later.    Now that you know which JDBC driver and Oracle JDBC classes to use, let's continue by  discussing the implications that the life cycle of an applet has on your JDBC program.     3.2 It's an Applet's Life  From a programmer's perspective, an applet has four stages to its life cycle. They are defined by  the following four methods that are called by the browser as the applet is loaded and run:   init       This is called just after an applet is created and before the applet is displayed in the  browser. It is normally used to perform any initialization that should take place only once  in the life cycle of the applet. This includes the creation of a thread to run the applet.    start       stop       destroy       This is called when the applet becomes visible in your browser and is used to start the  thread that runs the applet.    This is called when the applet is no longer visible. When this method is called, a well  behaved applet will put its thread to sleep, or stop the thread entirely, in order to  conserve computer resources.    This is called when the applet is purged from your browser's memory cache. It is used to  stop the applet's thread and to release any other computer resources the applet may be  using.    The choice of which of these methods you use to open and close a database connection is not  straightforward. You must consider how you will use the connection within your applet. If your  applet will open a database connection, retrieve some data, then close the connection, and do  this only once, you may wish to perform these functions in init   , as part of start   , or in  a method you create that is in turn run by the thread you start in the start    method. If your  applet will continue to use its connection throughout its life cycle, you will need to consider  whether to use init    and destroy    or start    and stop    to open and close the  connection.    If you use init    and destroy    to open and close an applet's connection, you will  minimize your cost, because the connection will remain open as long as the applet is in the  browser's cache. Opening and closing a database connection is very costly in time and  resources, so this can be a good thing. Remember, however, that your database connection will  not be closed until the browser flushes the applet from its cache or until the applet closes the  connection itself. Balance this behavior against the results of using start    and stop   .  Using start    and stop    will require your applet to open and close the database  connection each time the applet appears and disappears from your browser's screen. You risk  incurring greater overhead because of the additional open and close activity. However, you  reduce the number of simultaneous connections to your database, because the connection will  not remain open while the applet is off the screen, even when it is still in the browser's cache.    Example 3-1 shows the code for a simple applet that demonstrates just what we have been  discussing. Following that is an HTML file in Example 3-2 that invokes the sample applet. To  run the example, follow these steps:    1.  Modify the database URL in Example 3-1, changing the username, password, host, port   number, and SID to values appropriate for your installation.    2.  Compile the applet.     3.  Make a copy of your Oracle classesXXX.zip file, giving it the same name as the applet   but retaining the .zip suffix. In the case of Example 3-1, you should name your new file  TestApplet.zip.    4.  Add the applet's class file to your new zip file. According to Oracle's documentation, the   zip file must be uncompressed.    5.  Copy the TestApplet.zip and TestApplet.html files to an appropriate directory on a web   server.    6.  Open the HTML file in your browser.    7.  Turn on your browser's Java Console.    Example 3-1. A test life cycle applet   import java.applet.Applet;  import java.awt.*;  import java.sql.*;    public class TestApplet extends Applet {     private Connection conn;    private Timestamp created = new Timestamp System.currentTimeMillis      ;      public void init     {      try {        System.out.println          "init    : loading OracleDriver for applet created at " +           created.toString     ;               Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;         System.out.println "init    : getting connection" ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl","scott","tiger" ;       }      catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.err.println "init  : ClassNotFoundException: "  +  e.getMessage     ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println "init  : SQLException: " + e.getMessage     ;       }    }      public void start     {      System.out.println "start    : " ;    }       public void stop     {      System.out.println "stop    : " ;    }        public void paint Graphics g  {      System.out.println "paint    : querying the database" ;       try {        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        ResultSet rset = stmt.executeQuery            "select 'Hello 'initcap USER  result from dual" ;        while rset.next                g.drawString rset.getString 1 ,10,10 ;        rset.close    ;        stmt.close    ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println "paint  : SQLException: " + e.getMessage     ;       }    }      public void destroy     {      System.out.println        "destroy    : closing connection for applet created at " +        created.toString     ;      try {        conn.close    ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println "destroy: SQLException: " + e.getMessage     ;      }    }  }  Example 3-2. A Test Life Cycle Applet's HTML File               <applet code=TestApplet archive=TestApplet.zip width=100  height=25>         When you execute the applet, you'll see different behavior depending on your browser. If you're  using Internet Explorer 4, the applet will be downloaded and cached. Then it will be created,  triggering the init    method followed by the start    method. Now you should see "Hello  Scott" or whatever username you used in the applet. If you go to another URL, the stop     method is called, followed by the destroy    method. If you have the applet on screen and  click on the Reload button, you'll see the stop    and destroy    methods again followed by  init    and start   .    If you're using Netscape Navigator 4, you'll see different behavior more closely following my  previous explanation about an applet's life cycle. First, the applet will be downloaded and cached.  Next, the init    method will be called followed by the start    method. This time, when you  go to another URL, only the stop    method is called. When you return to the applet's URL, the  start    method is called. It's not until you click on Reload or the browser runs out of memory  cache that the destroy    method is called.    If you're ambitious, you can change one of the System.out.println    messages in the  applet, rebuild it, put it into the web server's directory while you still have your browser open, and  then click on Reload. Guess what? Neither browser actually reloads the applet from the server.  You won't see your new applet version until you close and reopen your browser.    Now that you have a better idea of the life cycle of an applet, and how it varies depending on the  browser, you may appreciate what I stated earlier: knowing when to open and close a database  connection is not straightforward. You must determine which model to use based on how the    applet will be used by the end user. Once you've decided on the best strategy for opening and  closing your database connection, then you may be faced with restrictions that the browser  environment places on an applet's ability to make a connection. But before we discuss that issue,  let's move on to the next section and talk a little about packaging your applets.   3.3 Packaging Your Applet  After you have written your applet, you'll want to combine its class files with those from the  appropriate Oracle classesXXX.zip file into a single zip or jar file as you did for Example 3-1.  This step is necessary because an applet using JDBC is naturally quite complex and contains  many classes. Getting to just one file makes things easier to manage. It is also simpler and more  efficient to specify just one file in the HTML APPLET tag rather than specify multiple archive files.       For simplicity's sake, this discussion on packaging focuses on  the use of JDK 1.2. If you are using JDK 1.1, the syntax for  using the jar tool to create the jar file will be slightly different.  If you use WinZip, the procedure will be the same as it is for  JDK 1.2.       3.3.1 A Development Packaging Cycle  During the development stage for an applet, you can begin your packaging effort by simply  making a copy of the Oracle classes12.zip file. Give it the name of your archive file but retain the  .zip extension. Then add your applet's class files, uncompressed, to the zip file that you just  copied and renamed. Why uncompressed? I actually don't know. This is an Oracle  recommendation. I have used them as compressed class files when I have created a jar file, but I  have never done so using a zip file. For example, if you're going to create a zip file for an applet  named TestAppletPolicy, you should follow these steps:    1.  Copy the file classes12.zip to TestAppletPolicy.zip. On a Windows system, you can do   this by executing a command such as:   copy c:\windows\ora81\jdbc\lib\classes12.zip TestAppletPolicy.zip   2.  Add your applet's class files to TestAppletPolicy.zip using your favorite zip utility. With   WinZip, you can right-click on the TestAppletPolicy.class file and select Add to Zip. Then  just select TestAppletPolicy.zip as your destination zip file.    3.  As you make changes to your applet, you can continue reading, or refreshing, your   applet's files to the TestAppletPolicy.zip file. Any time you create a new version of your  applet, repeat step 2 to add it to the zip file, overwriting the previous version.    In order to run your applet within a browser, create an HTML file with an APPLET tag, and specify  the name of your archive file in the APPLET tag's ARCHIVE parameter. Then, load that HTML file  into your browser window.   3.3.2 Production Packaging Cycles  When it comes time to put your highly polished applet into production, you can use the same  method as you did for development or the JDK's jar utility to build a new jar file. Regardless, you  can reduce the size of your archive by eliminating the OracleDatabaseMetaData.class file if it is  not needed. The OracleDatabaseMetaData.class file allows you to query the database for the  names of tables, stored procedures, and so forth. This file is 42 KB in size and a waste of network  bandwidth if it is not needed.     To create a zip file, follow the steps outlined for a development packaging cycle in the previous  section. To create a jar file for an applet, follow these steps:    1.  Create a temporary directory to hold all the class files that you want to place into your   new archive. For example, use the command md jar to create a temporary packaging  directory named jar.    2.  Make the temporary directory that you just created your current working directory. Use   the command cd jar to do this.    3.  Unzip the JDBC support classes into your temporary directory, preserving the directory  structure. To unzip the classes12.zip file, for example, execute the following command:   jar xf c:\oracle\ora81\jdbc\lib\classes12.zip   The jar utility will then unzip the Oracle classes12.zip file into your current working  directory. The directory structure of the classes in the zip file will be preserved with  subdirectories being created as necessary.    4.  Copy your applet's class file to your temporary directory. For example, copy the file   TestAppletPolicy.class to your jar directory by executing the command:   copy ..\TestAppletPolicy.class  If your application never makes a call to Connection.getMetaData   , delete the  OracleDatabaseMetaData.class file by executing the command:   del oracle\jdbc\driver\OracleDatabaseMetaData.class    5.   6.  Create a compressed jar file containing all the files in your temporary directory and in   subdirectories underneath it. For example, to create a compressed jar file for the  TestAppletPolicy applet, execute:   jar cf TestAppletPolicy.jar *  If you want to create an uncompressed jar, as Oracle suggests, you can do so by  executing:   jar c0f TestAppletPolicy.jar *   3.3.3 Oracle NLS Support  What if you use Oracle's National Language Support  NLS  in your applet? In this case, you'll  have to include the necessary NLS files in your jar file. To do that, follow these steps:    1.  Unzip the nls_charset12.zip file into a temporary directory separate from the one you are  using to package your applet. You'll get an nls\oracle\sql\converter directory structure as  a result.    2.   Identify the NLS class file s  you need.   3.  Create an nls\oracle\sql\converter directory structure underneath your temporary   packaging directory.    4.  Copy the NLS class file s  you need into your nls\oracle\sql\converter directory.    You can identify the NLS class files you need by looking in Table 3-2 to find the Oracle  character set IDs for the character sets your applet uses. These character set IDs are four-digit  numbers that are part of the filenames of the NLS language files. The naming convention is:   CharacterConverterOracle_character_set_id.class    For example, if you needed to support character set US8PC437, create the directory structure  nls\oracle\sql\converter in your temporary packaging directory and copy the file  CharacterConverter0004.class from the nls\oracle\sql\converter directory in which you unzipped  the NLS classes to the nls\oracle\sql\converter directory in your temporary packaging directory.    Table 3-2. Oracle character converter classes and the NLS character sets they support    Oracle character set   NLS_CHARSET_NAME  Oracle character set   NLS_CHARSET_NAME   ID   ID   0003   0004   0005   0006   0008   000a   000b   000c   000d   000e   000f   0010   0011   0012   0013   0014   0015   0016   0017   0019   0020   WE8HP   US8PC437   WE8EBCDIC37   WE8EBCDIC500   WE8EBCDIC285   WE8PC850   D7DEC   F7DEC   S7DEC   E7DEC   SF7ASCII   NDK7DEC   I7DEC   NL7DEC   CH7DEC   YUG7ASCII   SF7DEC   TR7DEC   IW7IS960   IN8ISCII   EE8ISO8859P2   002d   0032   003d   0046   0048   0051   0052   005a   005b   005c   005d   005e   005f   0060   006e   0071   0072   008c   0096   0098   0099   VN8MSWIN1258   WE8NEXTSTEP   AR8ASMO708PLUS   AR8EBCDICX   AR8XBASIC   EL8DEC   TR8DEC   WE8EBCDIC37C   WE8EBCDIC500C   IW8EBCDIC424   TR8EBCDIC1026   WE8EBCDIC871   WE8EBCDIC284   WE8EBCDIC1047   EEC8EUROASCI   EEC8EUROPA3   LA8PASSPORT   BG8PC437S   EE8PC852   RU8PC866   RU8BESTA    0021   0022   0023   0024   0025   0026   0027   0028   0029   002a   002b   002c   00a7   00aa   00ab   00ac   00ad   00ae   00af   00b0   00b1   00b2   00b3   00b4   00b5   00b6   IW8MACHEBREWS   00d3   SE8ISO8859P3   NEE8ISO8859P4   CL8ISO8859P5   AR8ISO8859P6   EL8ISO8859P7   IW8ISO8859P8   WE8ISO8859P9   NE8ISO8859P10   TH8TISASCII   TH8TISEBCDIC   BN8BSCII   VN8VN3   EE8MSWIN1250   CL8MSWIN1251   ET8MSWIN923   BG8MSWIN   EL8MSWIN1253   IW8MSWIN1255   LT8MSWIN921   TR8MSWIN1254   WE8MSWIN1252   BLT8MSWIN1257   D8EBCDIC273   I8EBCDIC280   DK8EBCDIC277   009a   009b   009c   009e   009f   00a0   00a1   00a2   00a3   00a4   00a5   00a6   00dd   00de   00df   00e0   00e1   00e2   00e7   00eb   00ef   00f1   00fb   0105   0106   IW8PC1507   RU8PC855   TR8PC857   CL8MACCYRILLIC   CL8MACCYRILLICS   WE8PC860   IS8PC861   EE8MACCES   EE8MACCROATIANS   TR8MACTURKISHS   IS8MACICELANDICS   EL8MACGREEKS   EL8GCOS7   US8BS2000   D8BS2000   F8BS2000   E8BS2000   DK8BS2000   S8BS2000   WE8BS2000   CL8BS2000   WE8BS2000L5   WE8DG   WE8NCR4970   WE8ROMAN8   EE8MACCE    00b7   00b8   00b9   00ba   00bb   00bc   00be   00bf   00c0   00c1   00c2   00c3   00c4   00c5   00c9   00ca   00cb   00cc   00cd   00ce   00cf   00d2   01f4   01f8   01f9   01fa   S8EBCDIC278   EE8EBCDIC870   CL8EBCDIC1025   F8EBCDIC297   IW8EBCDIC1086   CL8EBCDIC1025X   N8PC865   BLT8CP921   LV8PC1117   LV8PC8LR   BLT8EBCDIC1112   LV8RST104090   CL8KOI8R   BLT8PC775   F7SIEMENS9780X   E7SIEMENS9780X   S7SIEMENS9780X   N7SIEMENS9780X   I7SIEMENS9780X   D7SIEMENS9780X   WE8GCOS7   AR8ASMO8X   AR8NAFITHA711T   AR8SAKHR707T   AR8MUSSAD768T   0107   0108   0109   010a   010b   0115   0116   0117   015f   0160   0161   0162   0170   017c   017d   017e   017f   0181   0182   0186   0191   0344   0348   034a   034d   DK7SIEMENS9780X   0180   EE8MACCROATIAN   TR8MACTURKISH   IS8MACICELANDIC   EL8MACGREEK   IW8MACHEBREW   US8ICL   WE8ICL   WE8ISOICLUK   WE8MACROMAN8   WE8MACROMAN8S   TH8MACTHAI   TH8MACTHAIS   HU8CWI2   EL8PC437S   EL8EBCDIC875   EL8PC737   LT8PC772   LT8PC774   EL8PC869   EL8PC851   CDN8PC863   HU8ABMOD   JA16MACSJIS   KO16KSC5601   KO16DBCS   KO16KSCCS    01fb   01fc   01fd   01ff   0202   022a   022b   022c   022d   022e   022f   0230   0231   0233   0235   0236   0237   024e   031d   031e   033d   033e   033f   0340   0341   0342   AR8ADOS710T   AR8ADOS720T   AR8APTEC715T   AR8NAFITHA721T   AR8HPARABIC8T   AR8NAFITHA711   AR8SAKHR707   AR8MUSSAD768   AR8ADOS710   AR8ADOS720   AR8APTEC715   AR8MSAWIN   AR8NAFITHA721   AR8SAKHR706   AR8ARABICMAC   AR8ARABICMACS   AR8ARABICMACT   LA8ISO6937   US8NOOP   WE8DECTST   JA16VMS   JA16EUC   JA16EUCYEN   JA16SJIS   JA16DBCS   JA16SJISYEN   034e   0352   0353   0354   0355   035c   035d   035e   035f   0360   0361   0362   0363   03e4   03e6   0726   0728   0729   0730   0732   073a   073c   073d   0744   0747   0748   KO16MSWIN949   ZHS16CGB231280   ZHS16MACCGB231280   ZHS16GBK   ZHS16DBCS   ZHT32EUC   ZHT32SOPS   ZHT16DBT   ZHT32TRIS   ZHT16DBCS   ZHT16BIG5   ZHT16CCDC   ZHT16MSWIN950   KO16TSTSET   JA16TSTSET   JA16EUCFIXED   JA16SJISFIXED   JA16DBCSFIXED   KO16KSC5601FIXED   KO16DBCSFIXED   ZHS16CGB231280FIXED   ZHS16GBKFIXED   ZHS16DBCSFIXED   ZHT32EUCFIXED   ZHT32TRISFIXED   ZHT16DBCSFIXED    0343   JA16EBCDIC930   0749   ZHT16BIG5FIXED   The Oracle character set IDs shown in Table 3-2 and used in the CharacterConverter class  files are the hexadecimal values for the character set IDs.

Now that you understand how to gather your applet's files into an archive, we can begin our  discussion about the restrictions a browser places on an applet's ability to make a database  connection and the options available to work around these restrictions.   3.4 Getting Around the Sandbox  Applets run in a JVM in your browser. For security reasons, applets, by default, run with restricted  access to your computer's local resources. This restricted access to your computer's local  resources, or " sandbox" as it is affectionately  sometimes not-so-affectionately  called, limits an  applet's ability to contact other computers over the network. The rule is that applets are limited to  opening sockets, or network connections, only to the host from which they are downloaded. In  effect, this limits any applet to connecting to a database only on the same host from which it was  downloaded. If your database is installed on the same host as your web server, then this does not  pose a problem, but often, databases reside on a host of their own. When the latter is the case,  there are two ways you can work around this limitation using JDBC. The first is to use Oracle's  Connection Manager. The second is to get socket permissions for your applet.    If you try to connect to a database on a host other than the source of the applet, you'll get a  security exception. For example, the following is a security exception received from Internet  Explorer while running the applet named TestApplet:   init    : loading OracleDriver for applet created at 2000 -09-30  19:20:21.606  init    : getting connection  com.ms.security.SecurityExceptionEx[TestAppletInitDestroy.i nit]: cannot  connect to   "dssnt01"  Here is the same exception obtained from Netscape Navigator:  init    : loading OracleDriver for applet created at 2000 -09-30  19:22:33.576  init    : getting connection  netscape.security.AppletSecurityException: security.Co uldn't connect to  'dssnt01'   with origin from 'dssw2k01'.  Let's continue our discussion by looking at how to get around this restriction by using Oracle's  Connection Manager.   3.4.1 Using Connection Manager  Connection Manager is a lightweight, highly scalable, middle-tier program that receives and  forwards Net8 packets from one source to another. When Connection Manager resides on the  same host as a web server, an applet can get around the network connection restriction of the  sandbox by making a connection to Connection Manager, which will in turn forward any Net8  requests on to the appropriate database listener. As I stated in Chapter 2, you can classify the  combined use of Oracle's Thin driver together with Connection Manager as a Type 3 driver. To  use Connection Manager, you must install it on the same host as your applet's web server. Then  you must use a special form of database URL. And you thought we had covered every possible  type didn't you? First, let's cover Connection Manager's installation.     3.4.1.1 Installing Connection Manager   Installing Connection Manager is a simple process involving the following steps:    1.   Install Connection Manager from the Oracle Enterprise Edition original distribution CD.    2.  Create a configuration file.   3.  Start Connection Manager by executing cmctl start.   Follow your operating system's specific instructions to run the Oracle Universal Installer from the  original distribution CD. You must choose Install and then select a Custom Install. Next, browse  through the uninstalled products list until you find Oracle Connection Manager. Select it and then  proceed through the installation following the instructions on the screen.    After you're done installing Connection Manager, look in your  $ORACLE_HOME\network\admin\sample directory for a file named cman.ora. That file will be a  template of a Connection Manager configuration file. Copy the cman.ora file to  $ORACLE_HOME\network\admin. This will give you a default configuration for Connection  Manager that uses TCP IP port 1630 for your JDBC connection. Port 1830 will be used for  Connection Manager's administrator program, which is named cmctl. The default configuration  file contains a large number of comment lines. Example 3-3 shows only the uncommented lines  so you can easily see the port number assignments.    Example 3-3. The default Connection Manager configuration file   cman =  ADDRESS_LIST=              ADDRESS= PROTOCOL=tcp  HOST=  PORT=1630  QUEUESIZE=32                 cman_admin =  ADDRESS= PROTOCOL=tcp  HOST=  PORT=1830     cman_profile =  parameter_list=                      MAXIMUM_RELAYS=1024                       LOG_LEVEL=1                       TRACING=yes                       TRACE_DIRECTORY=C:\Oracle\Ora81\Network\Log                       RELAY_STATISTICS=yes                       SHOW_TNS_INFO=yes                       USE_ASYNC_CALL=yes                       AUTHENTICATION_LEVEL=0                       REMOTE_ADMIN=FALSE                     If you need to reconfigure Connection Manager to use a different set of ports, modify the PORT=  item for the cman and cman_admin listening addresses in your cman.ora file. Remember to use  your new cman port setting in your JDBC database URL.    Finally, to start Connection Manager, execute the command cmctl start. Now, your last step  in utilizing Connection Manager is to formulate a database URL.    3.4.1.2 Formulating a database URL for Connection Manager   When you formulate a database URL for Connection Manager, you're essentially combining an  address to Connection Manager with an address to a database. You will use Oracle's Net8  Transparent Network Substrate  TNS  keyword-value syntax to pass two addresses to the Thin  driver -- the Net8 keyword-value syntax is the only means of specifying more than one address in  a URL. The first address will be for the web server host. The second will be for your target  database. Since the second address is for a database, it will also specify an Oracle SID.    Formulating a database URL for Connection Manager is where most of the problems using  Connection Manager occur. For the most part, a URL for Connection Manager has the same  general format as you saw in Chapter 2:   jdbc:oracle:thin:@database  When you're connecting through Connection Manager, the database portion of the URL takes on  the following form:    description= address_list=   address= protocol=tcp  host=webhost  port=1630     address= protocol=tcp  host=orahost  port=1521      source_route=yes  connect_data= sid=orasid     which breaks down as:   webhost    The TCP IP address, or DNS alias, for your web server's host.   1630    orahost    1521    orasid    The Connection Manager port number specified in cman.ora. 1630 is the default value.    The TCP IP address, or DNS alias, for your target database's host.    The Net8 listener port number as specified in the listener.ora file on your database  server. 1521 is the default listener port.    The Oracle SID for your target database.    For example, if your web server's alias is dssw2k01, your database server's alias is dssnt01, and  your database SID is dssora01, then you should use the following Connection Manager URL:   jdbc:oracle:thin:@   description= address_list=   address= protocol=tcp  host=dssw2k01  port=1630     address= protocol=tcp  host=dssnt01  port=1521      source_route=yes  connect_data= sid=dssora01     Modify the connection statement of TestApplet from Example 3-1 to incorporate this new  URL, and the resulting statement will look like this:   conn = DriverManager.getConnection    "jdbc:oracle:thin:" +   "@ description= address_list=" +   " address= protocol=tcp  host=dssw2k01  port=1630  " +    " address= protocol=tcp  host=dssnt01  port=1521   " +    " source_route=yes " +   " connect_data= sid=dssora01   ","scott","tiger" ;  Connection Manager can also be used as a connection concentrator or as a firewall. Multiple  Connection Manager addresses can be specified prior to your database server address and SID  to create a chain of Connection Manager connections. In other words, you can route a connection  through any number of Connection Manager instances. For more information on Connection  Manager installation, configuration, and use, see Oracle's Net8 Administrator's Guide, which is  available on the OTN, or Oracle Net8 Configuration and Troubleshooting, by Hugo Toledo and  Jonathan Gennick  O'Reilly .     If you think using Connection Manager sounds like a lot of work, wait until you learn about the  other workaround option: getting socket permissions.   3.4.2 Getting Socket Permissions  In Java, a socket is the object used to make a TCP IP connection. Therefore, when a JDBC  driver makes a connection to a database it uses a socket object. Since an applet's permissions  to operating-system resources are typically restricted, using a socket on a host other than the one  from which the applet was downloaded is not allowed. Some arrangement must be made to  remove this restriction in order to make a remote database connection. Often, documentation on  this subject states that all you need to do is sign your applet to get socket permissions. That's an  oversimplification. In JDK 1.1, the idea was that a signed applet would run with all the same  privileges as an application. However, the implementation didn't strictly follow that idea. Instead,  in Netscape Navigator you had to use the Netscape.security package and enable  UniversalConnect. Enabling UniversalConnect caused the browser to prompt the user to  accept the extended privileges required to use Java sockets. Unfortunately, even if you did go  through all the work of adding the Netscape.security code to your applet, you soon found  that it didn't work, because there's a bug in the package that prevents an applet from getting  socket permissions. With Internet Explorer, you could set privileges under View  Internet  Options for both unsigned and signed applets. That worked, but then you had a single browser  solution. So how do you get socket permissions to work for a larger browser audience? The  solution is to use the Java 1.2  or higher  browser plug-in, a little JavaScript, and a security policy  entry for socket permissions. And no, you don't have to sign your applet.    Signing your applet will provide your applet's user with the peace of mind of knowing that it's from  you and has not been tampered with. Signing can be used as a basis for setting up a security  policy, but the actual policy is what will determine whether your applet will be able to make a  connection to a database that resides on a host other than the host from which your applet was  downloaded.    3.4.2.1 Java 2 security policies   The Java 2 platform allows you to set up a security policy by code base, which is the URL from  which your applet is downloaded; by signed by, which is the certificate alias in your key store  database in conjunction with signing your applet; or by both. If you set up a policy for a particular  code base, you have the following options to control the scope of that policy:      You can name a specific class, zip, or jar file in your code base URL.      You can end your code base URL with an asterisk  *  and thus apply the policy to any   applet file in the specified directory.       You can end your code base URL with a dash  -  and thus apply the policy to any applet   file in the specified directory or in any directory underneath the specified directory.    If instead you set up a policy for a particular certificate alias, then the policy will hold for any file  signed with that certificate. Finally, if you use both methods, then not only does the file need to be  signed using the specified certificate, but it also has to reside at the specified code base.    3.4.2.2 Setting up a SocketPermissions policy   In this section, I show you how to add a code base policy for SocketPermission, for a target of  the database's host and port combination, and for a connection.    To add a new policy you have one of two choices. You can create a new policy file and add it to  the list of policy files for your plug-in by modifying the policy file URLs list in the file java.security,    which is typically located in the c:\Program Files\Javasoft\JRE\1.2\lib\security directory.  Alternatively, you can add a policy to your user.home .java.policy policy file. Table 3-3 lists the  locations of the latter. Modify java.security if you want the changes to affect all users on a  multiuser system; modify the .java.policy file to affect only a single user.    Table 3-3. Java user policy file directories    Operating system   User policy file directory   Window 95   Window 98   Windows NT   Windows 2000   c:\Windows   c:\Windows   c:\WINNT\Profiles\username   c:\Documents and Settings\username   You can use a text editor to add the security policy to your policy file, but this requires you to  know the policy file's command syntax. You can find the command syntax in the API  documentation for the object in question -- in our case, a SocketPermission. Rather than use  a text editor, you can use the Java 2 policy maintenance program: Policy Tool, a GUI-based  application that greatly simplifies specifying a security policy.    Now that you have an overview of how to set up a policy, let's take a look at what is required for  opening a database connection on a host other than the web server from which you downloaded  your applet.    Your applet will need socket permissions in order to establish a remote database connection -- a  term I use to refer to connections made by an applet to a database on a host other than the one  from which the applet was downloaded. To add a socket permissions policy for your applet, start  the Policy Tool by executing the policytool command at the command line. If you have an existing  user policy file, the Policy Tool program will open that file by default when it starts. If you do not  have an existing policy file, don't worry; you'll still be able to make a policy entry, which you can  then save to a new user policy file. When the Policy Tool application starts, it displays the Policy  Tool screen shown in Figure 3-1.    Figure 3-1. The Policy Tool's main screen   Click the Add Policy Entry button, and you will be taken to a screen titled Policy Entry, which is  shown in Figure 3-2.        Figure 3-2. The Policy Entry screen      Enter the URL pointing to where your applet resides on the web server into the CodeBase field.  You have three choices as to how you can specify your entry. First, you can type the entire URL,  including the name of the class file, or archive file, containing the applet. This will limit the policy  to only the specified applet or its archive. For example, if you have an applet in an archive file  named TestAppletPolicy.zip, as specified in the applet tag's archive parameter, you can specify a  URL such as the following:   http:  dssw2k01 ojdbc TestAppletPolicy.zip   Your second choice is to specify the policy for any applet located in the last directory of the URL.  Do this by typing an asterisk instead of the applet's name or the archive's filename. For example,  to specify any applet that resides in the ojdbc directory on your web server, you can specify the  following:   http:  dssw2k01 ojdbc *   Finally, you can specify that the policy applies to any applet that exists in the last directory of the  URL, or in any directory subordinate to it, by typing a hyphen instead of the filename. For  example, to specify any applet in the ojdbc directory, or in any directory underneath ojdbc, you  can specify:   http:  dssw2k01 ojdbc -   You can see in Figure 3-2 that I specified the second choice, using an asterisk after the  directory, so that I can run any applet I create during the development cycle without having to  make multiple policy entries.    After you specify the value for CodeBase, click on the Add Permission button. This will take you  to the screen titled Permissions  shown in Figure 3-3 . Click on the Permission drop-down list  box, scroll down, and select SocketPermission. Next, tab to the text field to the right of Target  Name. Here you will enter the DNS Alias, or TCP IP address, for the database server's host  followed by a colon character and the port number for which you wish to grant socket  permissions. Port 1521 is the typical value for an Oracle database listener. You should just be  able to specify 1521, but this does not work on Windows 2000. Instead, you need to specify  1024- as a workaround, as I've done in Figure 3-3. The 1024- syntax opens up ports 1024 and  higher.    Figure 3-3. The Permissions screen       Next, click on the Action drop-down list box, scroll down, and select connect. Finally, click on the  OK button to return to the Policy Entry window  Figure 3-2 . From there, click on the Done  button. This will bring you back to the Policy Tool window  Figure 3-1 . From the Policy Tool  window, select File  the appropriate user policy directory as specified in Table 3-3. For more detail on the  specifications for SocketPermission, consult the JDK 1.2 API Javadoc for the  SocketPermission class.    Save As from the menu to get a save dialog. Save the file as .java.policy in   At this point, you know how to set up a policy to allow your applet to perform a remote database  connection. You can find more information about Java 2 platform security at  http:  java.sun.com security index.html or in Java Security by Scott Oaks  O'Reilly . Now  let's see what we can do to make the Java 2 plug-in load for a wide audience of browsers.    3.4.2.3 An adaptive applet tag   If the browser your audience will use can load the Java 2 plug-in, they'll be able to use your  applet to access a remote database. But how do you code your HTML to activate the Java 2 plug- in? You do so with a rather complex, but effective, use of JavaScript in your HTML file. The  following code was originally taken from  http:  java.sun.com products plugin 1.2 docs tags.html with some minor modifications. I  suggest you visit the page at this URL for an explanation of how this JavaScript code works,  including all the gory details.    First, you need to add some JavaScript to the top of your HTML file's body that will determine  whether the browser is Netscape, Internet Explorer, or something else. Here's the code to use:     tag.  -->     <!--    var _info = navigator.userAgent;    var _ns   = false;    var _ie   =  _info.indexOf "MSIE"  > 0     && _info.indexOf "Win"  > 0     && _info.indexOf "Windows 3.1"  < 0 ;     -->            <!--    var _ns =  navigator.appName.indexOf "Netscape"  >= 0      &&   _info.indexOf "Win"  > 0     && _info.indexOf "Win16"  < 0     && java.lang.System.getProperty "os.version" .indexOf "3.5"  < 0       _info.indexOf "Sun"  > 0  ;      -->        Then, for each applet, use the following code. In both the   and   tags, replace  code, codebase, and archive with values appropriate for the applet you are running.         <!--    if  _ie == true  document.writeln   '<OBJECT ' +  ' classid="clsid:8AD9C840-044E-11D1-B3E9-00805F499D93" ' +  'codebase="http:  java.sun.com products plugin 1.2.2 jinstall-1_2_2-win.  cabVersion=1,2,2,0" ' +  ' align="baseline" ' +  ' height="200" ' +  ' width="200" ' +  ' >  ' ;   else if  _ns == true  document.writeln   '<EMBED ' +  ' type="application x-java-applet;version=1.2.2" ' +  ' pluginspage="http:  java.sun.com products plugin 1.2 plugin - install.html" ' +  ' code="  code.class" ' +  ' codebase="  codebase" ' +  ' archive="  archive" ' +  ' align="baseline" ' +  ' height="200" ' +  ' width="200" ' +  ' otherparams="Add other parameters here" ' +  ' >  ' ;    -->      <APPLET    code="code.class"    codebase="codebase"    archive="archive"   align="baseline"    height="200"   width="200"    >                  <PARAM NAME="type"          VALUE="application x-java- applet;version=1.2.2">            No JDK 1.2 support for APPLET!!                 This JavaScript HTML code launches the Java 2 plug-in using the   tag for Netscape and  the   tag for Internet Explorer. The   tag is used for any other browser, so  long as that browser supports Java 2  Opera, for example .    3.4.2.4 An applet to test our SocketPermissions policy   We could use TestApplet, introduced earlier in the chapter, to test our applet's security policy,  but instead, let's use a slightly modified applet, TestAppletPolicy, along with a slightly  modified version of the   tag we just covered to help clarify how the browser is loading  the Java 2 plug-in. The applet modification is this: just after the init    method declaration I've  added a call to the System.out.println    method, passing the applet parameter  otherparams:   ...  public void init     {    System.out.println getParameter "otherparams"  ;   try {   ...  We'll use the following HTML document to test our applet policy. In the HTML I've added a  snippet of Javascript to conditionally specify the value of the otherparams parameter:          Test an Applet's access to Sockets using Java 2 Policies              tag.  -->     <!--    var _info = navigator.userAgent;    var _ns   = false;    var _ie   =  _info.indexOf "MSIE"  > 0     && _info.indexOf "Win"  > 0     && _info.indexOf "Windows 3.1"  < 0 ;     -->            <!--    var _ns =  navigator.appName.indexOf "Netscape"  >= 0      &&   _info.indexOf "Win"  > 0     && _info.indexOf "Win16"  < 0     && java.lang.System.getProperty "os.version" .indexOf "3.5"  < 0        _info.indexOf "Sun"  > 0  ;    -->                <!--    if  _ie == true  document.writeln   '<OBJECT ' +  ' classid="clsid:8AD9C840-044E-11D1-B3E9-00805F499D93" ' +  'codebase="http:  java.sun.com products plugin 1.2.2 jinstall-1_2_2-win.    cabVersion=1,2,2,0" ' +  ' align="baseline" ' +  ' height="20" ' +  ' width="750" ' +  ' >  ' +   '  ' ;    else if  _ns == true  document.writeln   '<EMBED ' +  ' type="application x-java-applet;version=1.2.2" ' +  ' pluginspage="http:  java.sun.com products plugin 1.2 plugin - install.html" ' +  ' code="TestAppletPolicy.class" ' +  ' codebase="."

To run TestPolicyApplet and test your security policy, follow these steps:    1.  Compile TestPolicyApplet.   2.  Add TestAppletPolicy.class to a copy of the classes12.zip file renamed   TestPolicyApplet.zip.     3.  Place the HTML code in the same directory as the applet archive.    4.  Create a policy as previously outlined but use the URL for your web server.    Now open the URL in your browser and you should get a message like this:   Hello Scott  If you're using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer and have the plug-in set to show the Java  console, the Java 2 Plug-in console will have opened, and you should be able to see a line such  as one of the following:   "Applet launched with OBJECT"  Internet Explorer   "Applet launched with EMBED"  Navigator   "Applet launched with APPLET"  Java 2 compatible browsers, e.g. Opera    If the Java console didn't show for Navigator or Internet Explorer, run the Java 2 Plug-in Control  Panel, select Show Java Console, close and reopen your browser, and try again. If you're using  Opera, select the Window  Console. There are several valuable pieces of information available from the Java Console. First,  Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer's Java 2 Plug-in console reports the user home  directory. You can use this information to verify that you put the policy in the correct file. Second,  you can see the name of the class or archive file that was opened. This helps you troubleshoot  the value you specify for CodeBase in the policy file.

As I've discussed, Java's implementation of the sandbox prevents your applet from opening a  socket to make a database connection on a remote database. In the next section, we will see  another security device, a firewall, that may also prevent your Java applet from establishing a  database connection.   3.5 Establishing a Connection Through a Firewall  Another constraint that you may have to deal with when accessing a remote database is the use  of firewalls. Firewalls allow only desirable connections between networks. This means that under  normal circumstances, a firewall will prevent your applet from connecting to a database located  on the other side of the firewall. The solution to this problem is to use a firewall that supports  Net8. Additionally, you need to use yet another special form of the Net8 connection string.   3.5.1 Configuring a Firewall for Net8  Firewalls use a set of rules to determine which clients can connect through them. These rules are  based on a client's hostname, DNS alias, or IP address. A firewall goes through several steps to  determine whether to allow an applet to connect and compare a client's hostname against its set  of rules. If a match is not found, the firewall extracts the IP address of a client and compares it  with the rules. Since an applet has restricted access to the local system, the JDBC Thin driver  cannot get the name of its host to pass in its connection request. You must, therefore, configure a  firewall to allow connections from the applet's IP address.       You must also never allow the hostname _ _jdbc_ _ to be  used in a firewall's set of rules. This literal has been coded  into Net8-compatible firewalls to force the lookup of the IP  address. If you inadvertently add this hostname to a firewall's  set of rules, any Oracle JDBC Thin driver will be able to pass    set of rules, any Oracle JDBC Thin driver will be able to pass  through the firewall.       You must also take into consideration that your applet may have to use a security policy to  access a remote firewall just as it needed a security policy to enable access to a remote  database. The only difference is the port you specify when you set up your socket permissions. If  the firewall resides on the same host as your web server, you'll have no problem making a  connection. If it does not, you'll have to use a security policy to give it socket permissions to  access the port on the firewall's server.   3.5.2 Formulating a Firewall Database URL  Similar to how you had to include an address for Connection Manager in the Net8 address string  when formulating a database URL to pass through Connection Manager, you'll need to include an  address string for your firewall host when making a connection through a firewall. Once again,  you will use Oracle's Net8 TNS keyword-value syntax to pass two addresses to the Thin driver.  This time, the first address will be for the firewall host; the second will be for your target database.  Since the second address is for a database, it will also have an Oracle SID. The resulting  database URL still has the same format we have been using all along:   jdbc:oracle:thin:@database  When you're connecting through a Net8 compliant firewall, the database portion of the URL  takes on the following form:    description= address_list=   address= protocol=tcp  host=firewallhost  port=1610      address= protocol=tcp  host=orahost  port=1521      source_route=yes  connect_data= sid=orasid     which breaks down as:  firewallhost    The TCP IP address, or DNS alias, for your firewall server   orahost    orasid    The TCP IP address, or DNS alias, for your target database server   The Oracle SID for your target database   For example, if your firewall server's alias is dssw2k01, your database server's alias is dssnt01,  and your Oracle SID is dssora01, then your firewall URL would look like this:   jdbc:oracle:thin:@   description= address_list=   address= protocol=tcp  host=dssw2k01  port=1610     address= protocol=tcp  host=dssnt01  port=1521      source_route=yes  connect_data= sid=dssora01     For more information on formulating a firewall database URL, see Oracle's Net8 Administrator's  Guide or Oracle Net8 Configuration and Troubleshooting, by Hugo Toledo and Jonathan Gennick   O'Reilly .   3.5.3 Net8-Compliant Firewalls  Net8 is supported by several firewall vendors. To save you some time, I've compiled a list of  firewall vendors who state in their documentation that they support Net8. This list includes only    vendors whose documentation is available on the Internet. The list is shown in Table 3-4 and  consists of the vendor's name, the name of their firewall product, and one or more URLs at which  you can find additional information. In addition, the Firewall Report is an excellent source of  information. It's available for a subscription fee at http:  www.outlink.com  and contains  detailed information on almost every firewall product available.    Table 3-4.

For an intranet-based application, Connection Manager is your easiest solution. If an applet will  be used solely on your internal network, common sense dictates that there is probably no need to  go through the additional work of signing your applets to establish trust, for you know who has  created them, and you implicitly trust the individuals that work for your organization. In addition,  and for the same reason, there is no need to set up a security policy to restrict the applet's  access to a specified resource. By using Connection Manager, you do not need to go through    either of these steps to establish a remote connection, thereby saving you the costs of signing  your applets and administering local policy on each user's desktop.    On the other hand, for an Internet-based application, you will want the signed applet to verify a  trust chain and to force the use of a security policy to restrict the applet's access to local  resources. As an end user of an Internet-based applet, you'll want to verify that the applet is from  the source you trust and prevent the applet from accessing any restricted resources. In addition,  you may be required to pass through a firewall to access a remote database, in which case the  applet's signer will need to use the firewall URL syntax to establish a remote database connection  through your firewall and the signer's firewall.    Now that you are aware of the special considerations of establishing a connection in an applet,  let's move on to those for servlets in Chapter 4.   Chapter 4. Servlet Database Connections  In this chapter, we'll explore issues that are specific to using JDBC with servlets. Unlike applets,  servlets can use the OCI driver as well as the Thin driver. Like applets, servlets have a distinct life  cycle that will impact your selection of a connection strategy. Let's begin our exploration by  examining your driver choices when developing servlets.   4.1 Oracle Driver Selection  With servlets, you can use either the OCI driver or the Thin driver. As is the case when  developing applications, I recommend you use the Thin driver unless one of the following  considerations applies to your work:       You make heavy use of stored procedures.     You have the ability to make a Bequeath connection to the database.   For most practical purposes, the Thin driver is just as fast as the OCI driver. One exception is  when you execute stored procedures. When stored procedures are invoked, the Thin driver can  take up to twice as long as the OCI driver to execute a call. What does this mean in terms of  response time? If it typically takes half a second for the OCI driver to make a stored-procedure  call, then it will take the Thin driver one second. That's not much of a problem if you make only  one stored-procedure call for each call you make to your servlet. The situation changes, however,  if you make multiple stored-procedure calls for each call to your servlet. In such a case, your  response time can deteriorate quickly. In our scenario, three stored-procedure calls will lead to a  three-second delay. So if your servlets typically make several calls to stored procedures, you  should consider using the OCI driver.    The other reason to use the OCI driver is to allow your servlet to make a Bequeath connection to  the database. Using the Bequeath protocol results in a direct connection to a dedicated server  process that allows your servlet to communicate directly with the Oracle8i database. You bypass  the Net8 listener process and eliminate the layer of software associated with TCP IP.  Consequently, a Bequeath connection can result in a significant gain in response time as  opposed to a TCP IP connection. Bequeath connections, however, can be made only in one  situation -- your servlet container and your database must reside on the same host.    Now that you understand your options for selecting an Oracle driver for servlet development, let's  examine the life cycle of a servlet to see how it will affect your strategy for making a connection.   4.2 Servlet Connection Strategies    From a programmer's perspective, a servlet has three stages to its life cycle. They are defined by  the following three methods, or types of methods:   init       This method is normally used to perform any initialization that should take place only  once in the lifetime of the servlet. The init    method is invoked automatically before  any of the servlet's doXXX    methods can be called.    The various do methods -- doGet   , doDelete   , doPost   , and doPut    --  are called as needed by web users to satisfy their dynamic content and form processing  needs.    doXXX       destroy       This method is called just before the servlet container removes the servlet from memory,  which typically happens when the servlet container itself is shutting down.    Given the life cycle described here, you have four strategies for making a database connection.  The differences between these strategies hinge on when the connection is made and on whether  connections are shared between servlets. The four strategies are:   Per-transaction connection    You load the Oracle JDBC driver in the servlet's init    method, open a connection at  the beginning of each doXXX    method, and close that connection at the end of each  doXXX    method.    Dedicated connection    You use a combination of the init    and destroy    methods, whereby you load  the driver and open a connection in the init    method, and then close that connection  in the destroy    method. As a result, the servlet uses one connection that remains  open during the servlet's entire lifetime and is shared by all users of the servlet.    Session connection    Cached connection    You load the Oracle JDBC driver in the init    method, but you don't open a  connection until the beginning of the first doXXX    method. You then store that  connection in an HTTP Session object, from which it can be retrieved and used by other  doXXX    method calls invoked by the same user session.    You use a connection pool to minimize the total number of connections that are open at  any one time. At the beginning of each doXXX    method, you allocate a connection  from the connection pool for use while the method executes then return that connection  to the pool at the end of the doXXX    method.    Let's start a more detailed examination of these methods by looking first at the per-transaction  connection strategy.   4.2.1 A Per-Transaction Connection  The per-transaction connection strategy is the kind of connection that most CGI programs use,  and it's the least efficient of the four strategies. The Oracle JDBC driver is loaded once in the  init    method. While the servlet is in operation, a new database connection is created at the  beginning of each doXXX    method and is closed at the end of each doXXX    method. This  model for managing connections is inefficient, because database connections are costly to create  in terms of both response time and system resources. As a result, connecting to a database is a  time-consuming process for the servlet. In addition, because connection creation is a costly    process for the database, frequent connecting and disconnecting will impact the response time of  other database users. Regardless of all this, there may be cases where such an approach is  justified. Example 4-1 shows a servlet that uses a per-transaction connection.    Example 4-1. A one-connection-per-transaction servlet   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class TransactionConnectionServlet extends HttpServlet {       public void init ServletConfig config      throws ServletException {      super.init config ;      try {            Load the driver        Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" .newInstance    ;       }      catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "TransactionConnection.init     ClassNotFoundException: " +           e.getMessage     ;      }      catch  IllegalAccessException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "TransactionConnection.init     IllegalAccessException: " +           e.getMessage     ;      }      catch  InstantiationException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "TransactionConnection.init     InstantiationException: " +           e.getMessage     ;      }    }      public void doGet      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response       throws IOException, ServletException {            response.setContentType "text html" ;      PrintWriter out = response.getWriter    ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " A Per Transaction Connection " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;        Connection connection = null;      try {           Establish a connection        connection = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        throw new UnavailableException            "TransactionConnection.init     SQLException: " +           e.getMessage     ;      }        Statement  statement = null;      ResultSet  resultSet = null;      String     userName  = null;        try {            Test the connection        statement = connection.createStatement    ;        resultSet = statement.executeQuery          "select initcap user  from sys.dual" ;        if  resultSet.next               userName = resultSet.getString 1 ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        out.println          "TransactionConnection.doGet     SQLException: " +           e.getMessage     + " " ;      }      finally {        if  resultSet != null            try { resultSet.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }        if  statement != null            try { statement.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       }        if  connection != null  {           Close the connection        try { connection.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }      }        out.println "Hello " + userName + "! " ;      out.println "You're using a per transaction connection! " ;       out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;    }      public void doPost      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response      throws IOException, ServletException {      doGet request, response ;    }  }  When the servlet shown in Example 4-1 is loaded into a servlet container, the init    method  is called before any of the doXXX    method requests are processed. This is standard behavior  for any servlet. In this servlet, TransactionConnectionServlet, the init    method first  passes the config object on to its parent class. Next, it loads the Oracle driver using the  Class.forName  .newInstance    method. Using this form of the Class.forName     method guarantees you compatibility with noncompliant JVMs but at the cost of having to catch  two additional exception types: IllegalAccessException and InstantiationException.  As the servlet operates, whenever a doGet    or doPost    method is called, a new database  connection is opened, the database is queried as needed, and the connection is closed. This is  simple, and often effective, but can be an inefficient method for managing connections.    Our next method, a dedicated connection, is somewhat more efficient, so let's take a look at it.     4.2.2 A Dedicated Connection  Of the four strategies, the dedicated connection is the most costly in terms of the number of  simultaneous database connections. Remember that a dedicated connection is opened when a  servlet is initialized and closed when the servlet is destroyed. A dedicated connection remains  open during the entire lifetime of a servlet and is dedicated to just that one servlet.    There are three drawbacks to a dedicated connection:      You need a database connection for every JDBC servlet instance that is active in your   servlet container. This may not really be that much of a drawback, because Oracle claims  that its database is very efficient at handling many simultaneous connections.       Since the connection will be shared with every user of the servlet, a transaction cannot   span multiple calls to the servlet's doXXX    methods. This means that you cannot  provide a user with several forms in a row, using several servlets, and commit all the  user's database changes after the last of those forms has been filled out. You instead  have to commit a user's input for each form as it is submitted.       Because the Oracle Connection class's methods are synchronized, only one invocation   of any given method is allowed at any one time. You will experience a processing  bottleneck when multiple invocations of the doXXX    methods attempt to use the  connection at the same time. The doXXX    methods will have to wait their turn for  access to the Connection class's synchronized methods.    Example 4-2 shows a sample servlet that uses a dedicated connection.    Example 4-2. A dedicated connection servlet   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class DedicatedConnectionServlet extends HttpServlet {     Connection connection;    long       connected;      public void init ServletConfig config      throws ServletException {      super.init config ;      try {            Load the driver        Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" .newInstance    ;       }      catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "DedicatedConnection.init     ClassNotFoundException: " +           e.getMessage     ;      }      catch  IllegalAccessException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "DedicatedConnection.init     IllegalAccessException: " +          e.getMessage     ;      }      catch  InstantiationException e  {        throw new UnavailableException            "DedicatedConnection.init     InstantiationException: " +           e.getMessage     ;      }        try {           Establish a connection        connection = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;         connected = System.currentTimeMillis    ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "DedicatedConnection.init     SQLException: " +           e.getMessage     ;      }    }      public void doGet      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response        throws IOException, ServletException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;      PrintWriter out = response.getWriter    ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " A Dedicated Connection " ;       out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;            Statement statement = null;      ResultSet resultSet = null;      String    userName  = null;        try {            test the connection        statement = connection.createStatement    ;        resultSet = statement.executeQuery          "select initcap user  from sys.dual" ;        if  resultSet.next              userName = resultSet.getString 1 ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {       out.println         "DedicatedConnection.doGet     SQLException: " +          e.getMessage     + " " ;      }      finally {        if  resultSet != null            try { resultSet.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  statement != null            try { statement.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       }      out.println "Hello " + userName + "! " ;      out.println        "This Servlet's database connection was created on " +        new java.util.Date connected  + " " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;      }      public void doPost      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response       throws IOException, ServletException {      doGet request, response ;    }      public void destroy     {         Close the connection      if  connection != null         try { connection.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }     }  }  When the servlet shown in Example 4-2 is loaded into a servlet container, the init    method  is invoked. The init    method then loads the Oracle JDBC driver. All this occurs before any  doXXX    method requests are processed. So far, this sequence of events is the same as that  for the servlet named TransactionServlet in Example 4-1. In this case, though, the init     method also attempts to connect to the database. If the init    method cannot load the  Oracle JDBC driver and establish a connection, it will throw an UnavailableException. This  will manifest itself as a 503 error in the user's browser.    The doGet    method shown in Example 4-2 uses the database connection to retrieve the  login user's username from the database. It then displays that username in the user's browser  along with the date and time that the connection was established. The database connection will  persist and can be used by other doXXX    methods until the servlet is destroyed. You can  verify this by executing the servlet, waiting several minutes, and then executing it again. You'll  notice that the servlet displays the same initial connection time no matter how many times you  execute it. This connection time indicates how long the connection has been open.    When the servlet is unloaded from the servlet container, the destroy    method is invoked.  The destroy    method in turn closes the dedicated connection.    The dedicated connection strategy yields an improvement in response time efficiency over the  per-transaction connection strategy because the connection is already open, but it requires many  more simultaneous database connections. This is because you must have a dedicated  connection for every servlet that accesses the database. In even a small application, this can be  hundreds of connections.    The next strategy we will discuss -- the session connection strategy -- improves response time by  removing the bottleneck of a single connection object. It also resolves the transaction boundary  problem. However, all this is still at the cost of many simultaneous database connections.   4.2.3 A Session Connection  If your servlet is part of a larger application that calls for a connection that is dedicated to a  particular user, then a session connection is your best option. The session connection strategy is  similar to that used for an application client -- the connection is opened at the beginning of the  program and closed when the application is closed. In the case of servlets, a connection is  established the first time a particular user calls a servlet requiring a connection. The connection  then remains open until the user's session expires.    For example, suppose you are writing a servlet that is part of a human resources application. Due  to the highly confidential nature of HR data, and because you need to keep an audit trail of who  makes changes to the data, you may decide that you cannot use a dedicated connection as we    did in the previous section. Remember that a dedicated connection is shared by all users of a  servlet. In this case, to ensure that each session gets its own connection, you can open a  connection for a given username and store that connection in an HTTP session object. The  session object itself will be available from one HTTP transaction to the next, because a reference  to it will be stored and retrieved by your browser using cookies. This functionality is handled  automatically by the HttpServlet class as per the servlet API specification. Since the reference  for the database connection will be stored in the user's session object, the connection will be  available to all servlets invoked by the user's session. Example 4-3 demonstrates one way to  implement a session connection strategy.    Example 4-3. A session connection servlet   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class Login extends HttpServlet {      public void init ServletConfig config      throws ServletException {      super.init config ;      try {            Load the driver        Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" .newInstance    ;       }      catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "Login init   ClassNotFoundException: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      catch  IllegalAccessException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "Login init   IllegalAccessException: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      catch  InstantiationException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "Login init   InstantiationException: " + e.getMessag e     ;      }    }      public void doGet      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response        throws IOException, ServletException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;      PrintWriter out = response.getWriter    ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " Login " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;            HttpSession session = request.getSession    ;      Connection connection =         Connection session.getAttribute "connection" ;      if  connection == null  {        String userName = request.getParameter "username" ;           String password = request.getParameter "password" ;         if  userName == null  password == null  {              Prompt the user for her username and password          out.println " " ;          out.println "Please specify the following to log in: " ;           out.println "Username: <input type=\"text\" " +            "name=\"username\" size=\"30\"> " ;          out.println "Password: <input type=\"password\" " +            "name=\"password\" size=\"30\"> " ;          out.println " " ;          out.println " " ;        }        else {              Create the connection          try {            connection = DriverManager.getConnection              "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", userName, password ;           }          catch  SQLException e  {            out.println "Login doGet   " + e.getMessage     ;           }          if  connection != null  {               Store the connection            session.setAttribute "connection", connection ;             response.sendRedirect "Login" ;            return;          }        }      }      else {        String logout = request.getParameter "logout" ;         if  logout == null  {             Test the connection          Statement statement = null;          ResultSet resultSet = null;          String    userName  = null;            try {             statement = connection.createStatement    ;             resultSet = statement.executeQuery              "select initcap user  from sys.dual" ;            if  resultSet.next                   userName = resultSet.getString 1 ;          }          catch  SQLException e  {            out.println "Login doGet   SQLException: "  + e.getMessage      + " " ;          }          finally {            if  resultSet != null                try { resultSet.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }             if  statement != null                try { statement.close    ; } catch  SQLExcepti on ignore  { }          }          out.println "Hello " + userName + "! " ;          out.println "Your session ID is " + session.getId     + " " ;           out.println "It was created on " +            new java.util.Date session.getCreationTime      + " "  ;            out.println "It was last accessed on " +            new java.util.Date session.getLastAccessedTime      + " " ;           out.println " " ;          out.println "<input type=\"submit\" name=\"logout\" " +            "value=\"Logout\">" ;          out.println " " ;        }        else {             Close the connection and remove it from the session           try { connection.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }           session.removeAttribute "connection" ;          out.println "You have been logged out." ;        }      }      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;    }      public void doPost      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response       throws IOException, ServletException {      doGet request, response ;    }  }  As in the previous examples, the init    method is called before any of the doXXX    method  requests are processed. In this servlet, the init    method loads the Oracle JDBC driver using  the Class.forName  .newInstance    method. If the Login servlet cannot load the Oracle  JDBC driver, it throws an UnavailableException.    When a user executes the servlet's doGet    method, the following sequence of events occurs:    1.  A request object is implicitly passed as part of the HttpServlet class's normal   functionality.    2.  The doGet    method then uses the HttpServletRequest object's getSession      method to get the current HttpSession object. If no current HttpSession object  exists, the getSession    method automatically creates a new one.    3.  The doGet    method invokes the HttpSession object's getAttribute    method  in order to get the Connection object for the session. If no Connection object exists,  getAttribute    returns a null. If a Connection object does exist, control goes to  step 7.    4.   5.   6.   If the doGet    method sees that the Connection object is null, it will then check to  see whether the user has passed a username and password as parameters of an HTML  form.    If username and password values are found, the doGet    method uses those passed  values to log into the database and create a new database connection. Because this is a  sample program, control is then redirected back to the Login servlet to show the user its  HttpSession information.    If no username and password parameters are found, the doGet    method creates an  HTML form to prompt the user for that information. When the user enters the username  and password into the form and then submits it, the Login servlet is called once again.     7.   8.   9.   If a Connection object does exist for the session, the doGet    method tests to see if  the user has passed a parameter named logout as part of an HTML form.    If a logout parameter has been passed, the doGet    method closes the database  connection, removes the reference to that connection from the session object, and  displays a logged out verification message.    If a connection exists, and no logout parameter has been passed, the doGet     method uses the connection to retrieve the database username from the database. It  then displays information about the user's session.    If you were to code a doPost    method for the Login servlet, you'd have to add the same  session connection code to that method as I've implemented for the doGet    method. For that  matter, any doXXX    method that requires database access would require this session  connection code.    4.2.3.1 Creating a session-bound wrapper for connections   With the servlet shown in Example 4-3, a user's database connection remains open until that  user submits a form containing a parameter named logout to the servlet. That's all well and  good, but what happens when the user forgets to log out before closing her browser? Or when  the session times out? The answer, unfortunately, is that the connection will not be closed. It will  remain open until the Oracle process monitor recognizes that the session is gone, at which point  the Oracle process monitor closes the connection. This is terribly inefficient! Fortunately, there is  an elegant solution to this problem. By using the HttpSessionBinding interface, you can wrap  a connection object in a session-bound object that is notified when the session expires. The  session-bound object can then in turn close the connection. Example 4-4 shows a wrapper  class for a connection. This wrapper class is named SessionConnection.   Example 4-4. A session-bound wrapper class for a connection   import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class SessionConnection    implements HttpSessionBindingListener {      Connection connection;      public SessionConnection     {      connection = null;    }      public SessionConnection Connection connection  {      this.connection = connection;    }      public Connection getConnection     {      return connection;    }      public void setConnection Connection connection  {       this.connection = connection;    }      public void valueBound HttpSessionBindingEvent event  {       if  connection != null  {          System.out.println "Binding a valid connection" ;       }      else {        System.out.println "Binding a null connection" ;       }    }      public void valueUnbound HttpSessionBindingEvent event  {       if  connection != null  {        System.out.println          "Closing the bound connection as the session expires" ;         try { connection.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       }    }  }  The SessionConnection class shown in Example 4-4 holds a connection and implements  the HttpSessionBindingListener interface. When you create a new Connection object,  you also need to create a new SessionConnection object. You then store your new  Connection object in that SessionConnection object. Then, when a session expires, the  HttpSession object notifies the SessionConnection object that it is about to be unbound.  This notification happens because the SessionConnection class implements the  HttpSessionBindingListener interface. In turn, the SessionConnection object closes  the database connection so it's not left hanging in an open state after the session has ended.    4.2.3.2 Using the session bound wrapper class   Creating the SessionConnection class is not enough. You also need to code your servlet to  use that class when managing connections. Example 4-5 shows a modified version of the  Login servlet shown earlier. It can now use the SessionConnection class. The servlet has  been renamed SessionLogin and uses a SessionConnection object to manage  connections.    Example 4-5. An HttpSessionBindingListener session connection servlet   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class SessionLogin extends HttpServlet {      public void init ServletConfig config      throws ServletException {      super.init config ;      try {            Load the driver        Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" .newInstance    ;      }      catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "Login init   ClassNotFoundException: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      catch  IllegalAccessException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "Login init   IllegalAccessException: " + e.getMessage     ;       }        catch  InstantiationException e  {        throw new UnavailableException          "Login init   InstantiationException: " + e.getMessage     ;       }    }      public void doGet      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response        throws IOException, ServletException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;      PrintWriter out = response.getWriter    ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " Login " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;            HttpSession session = request.getSession    ;      SessionConnection sessionConnection =         SessionConnection session.getAttribute "sessionconnection" ;       Connection connection = null;      if  sessionConnection != null  {        connection = sessionConnection.getConnection    ;        }      if  connection == null  {        String userName = request.getParameter "username" ;         String password = request.getParameter "password" ;        if  userName == null  password == null  {              Prompt the user for her username and password           out.println " " ;          out.println "Please specify the following to log in: " ;          out.println "Username: <input type=\"text\" " +            "name=\"username\" size=\"30\"> " ;          out.println "Password: <input type=\"password\" " +            "name=\"password\" size=\"30\"> " ;          out.println " " ;          out.println " " ;        }        else {              Create the connection          try {            connection = DriverManager.getConnection              "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", userName, password ;           }          catch  SQLException e  {            out.println "Login doGet   " + e.getMessage     ;           }          if  connection != null  {               Store the connection            sessionConnection = new SessionConnection    ;             sessionConnection.setConnection connection ;            session.setAttribute "sessionconnection", sessionConnection ;             response.sendRedirect "SessionLogin" ;            return;          }         }        }      else {        String logout = request.getParameter "logout" ;        if  logout == null  {             Test the connection          Statement statement = null;          ResultSet resultSet = null;          String    userName  = null;            try {             statement = connection.createStatement    ;             resultSet = statement.executeQuery              "select initcap user  from sys.dual" ;            if  resultSet.next                  userName = resultSet.getString 1 ;          }          catch  SQLException e  {            out.println "Login doGet   SQLException: " + e.getMessage      + " " ;          }          finally {            if  resultSet != null                try { resultSet.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }             if  statement != null                try { statement.close    ; } catch  SQLExcep tion ignore  { }          }          out.println "Hello " + userName + "!

You  can see in the doGet    method that instead of getting a Connection object directly from an    HttpSession object, this servlet gets a SessionConnection object from an HttpSession  object. If the SessionConnection object is valid  i.e., it is not initialized to null , an attempt is  then made using that object's getConnection    method to get a connection object. If no  connection object exists, the doGet    method creates one. It then creates a new  SessionConnection object in which to store the newly created Connection object. The  SessionConnection object in turn is stored in the HttpSession object.    The SessionConnection class shown in Example 4-4 contains several  System.out.println    method calls you can use for debugging purposes. If you compile  the SessionConnection.java and SessionLogin.java files, place them into service on your servlet  container, and set your servlet container's session timeout to a reasonably small period -- such as  two minutes -- you can see the HttpSessionBindingListener interface in action.    As you can see from these last few examples, using the session connection strategy can add a  significant amount of code to your servlet. If you don't need a connection dedicated to a user,  then you are better off using a cached connection. Let's talk about that next.   4.2.4 A Cached Connection  A cached connection, or pooled connection as it is sometimes called, is the most efficient  connection strategy. A separate Connection Manager object is created in the servlet container  that manages a pool of cached connections  you'll see an example Connection Manager  implementation shortly . When your servlet requires a connection, it asks Connection Manager for  a connection. Connection Manager then finds an unused connection, or creates a new  connection if necessary, and passes that back for the servlet to use. The servlet returns the  connection to the cache when it is no longer needed.    Connection Manager allocates connections, which are all made using a pool username and  password, as needed by the servlets in the servlet container. Rather than close the connections  when they are returned to Connection Manager, they are placed in a cache in an open state until  another servlet requires them. There are several connection-caching products on the market for  Java. Later, in Chapter 7, I will show Oracle's connection-caching implementation. But since I  can't dissect them to help you get a better understanding of how they work, I've put together a  connection-caching tool of my own for you to examine. This tool consists of the following  components:       A class to wrap cached connections     A class to load drivers and create connections     A class to manage cached connections   The following sections show and describe each of these classes. Following the class descriptions  are examples of servlets that use the classes to implement a cached connection strategy.    4.2.4.1 A class to wrap cached connections   For each connection, my caching tool needs to keep track of not only the Connection object  itself, but also the following two pieces of information:       The time the connection was last used     Whether the connection is currently in use   To accomplish this objective, I've created a wrapper class named CachedConnection, which is  shown in Example 4-6.     Example 4-6. The CachedConnection class to wrap cached connections   import java.sql.*;    public class CachedConnection {    private boolean    inUse;    private Connection conn;    private long       lastUsed;    private String     baseName;      public CachedConnection     {       conn     = null;      inUse    = false;      lastUsed = System.currentTimeMillis    ;      baseName = "Database";    }      public CachedConnection Connection conn, boolean inUse  {        this.conn     = conn;      this.inUse    = inUse;      this.lastUsed = System.currentTimeMillis    ;      this.baseName = "Database";    }      public CachedConnection Connection conn, boolean inUse, String  baseName  {       this.conn     = conn;      this.inUse    = inUse;      this.lastUsed = System.currentTimeMillis    ;      this.baseName = baseName;    }      public Connection getConnection     {       return conn;     }      public void setConnection Connection conn  {       this.conn = conn;     }      public boolean getInUse     {      return inUse;    }      public boolean isInUse     {      return inUse;    }      public void setInUse boolean inUse  {      if  !inUse         lastUsed = System.currentTimeMillis    ;      this.inUse = inUse;    }      public String getBaseName     {      return baseName;    }        public void setBaseName String baseName  {      this.baseName = baseName;    }      public long getLastUsed     {      return lastUsed;    }  }  A CachedConnection object has the following four attributes:   inUse    A boolean that keeps track of whether the connection is in use. A value of true  indicates that the connection has been checked out by a servlet. A value of false  indicates that the connection is available.    A JDBC Connection object that is cached in the pool.    A long that holds the time the connection was last checked out. This is used by the  management class to determine when to close and remove from the cache connections  that have not been used in a predetermined period of time.    conn    lastUsed    baseName    A String object that holds the name of the pool to which this connection belongs. This  allows you to manage several different connection pools simultaneously.    The CachedConnection class's isInUse    method is a function you can use in a logical  statement to check if the connection is in use. The rest of the methods are getter-setter methods  for the class.    4.2.4.2 A class to load drivers and create connections   The next class in my connection caching tool is a class to manage the loading of JDBC drivers  and the creation of connections. This class is named Database, and it's shown in Example 4-7.   Example 4-7. The database class to manage driver loading and connection creation   import java.sql.*;  import java.util.*;    public class Database {    private static boolean verbose  = false;      public static final Connection getConnection String baseName  {       Connection conn = null;      String driver   = null;      String url      = null;      String username = null;      String password = null;      try {        ResourceBundle resb = ResourceBundle.getBundle baseName ;         driver              = resb.getString "database.driver" ;         url                 = resb.getString "database.url" ;         username            = resb.getString "database.username" ;        password            = resb.getString "database.password" ;           Class.forName driver ;      }      catch MissingResourceException e  {        System.err.println "Missing Resource: " + e.getMessage     ;         return conn;      }      catch ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.err.println "Class not found: " + e.getMessage     ;         return conn;      }      try {        if  verbose  {          System.out.println "baseName=" + baseName ;          System.out.println "driver=" + driver ;          System.out.println "url=" + url ;          System.out.println "username=" + username ;          System.out.println "password=" + password ;        }          conn = DriverManager.getConnection url, username, password ;       }      catch SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        System.err.println "in Database.getConnection" ;         System.err.println "on getConnection" ;        conn = null;      }      finally {        return conn;      }    }      public static void setVerbose boolean v  {      verbose = v;    }  }  Database is a utility class that employs the use of a static variable and two static methods that  allow you to call the methods without instantiating the class. The attribute verbose is a boolean  that controls the output of diagnostics to standard out. The getConnection    method takes a  String argument named baseName, which identifies a properties file on the local filesystem.  This properties file must be generated before invoking the getConnection    method, and in it  you should place the connection properties that you want each new connection to have. The  following is a hypothetical example of a properties file:   database.driver=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver  database.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl  database.username=scott  database.password=tiger  In my solution, the pool name is used as the properties filename, so each pool can have its own,  distinct set of connection properties. All connections in a given pool share the same set of  properties.    4.2.4.3 A class to manage cached connections    The final piece of my connection-caching solution is a class to manage cached connections,  doling them out to servlets as they are needed. The CacheConnection class, shown in  Example 4-8, does this.    Example 4-8. The CacheConnection class to manage cached connections   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.util.Vector;    public class CacheConnection {    private static boolean verbose           = false;

     CachedConnection cached = null;         if  verbose  {        System.out.println "There are " +          Integer.toString numberConnections  +          " connections in the cache" ;        System.out.println "Searching for a connection not in use..." ;       }      for  int i=0;!found && i<numberConnections;i++  {         if  verbose  {          System.out.println "Vector entry " + Integer.toString i  ;         }        cached =  CachedConnection cachedConnections.get i ;         if  !cached.isInUse   && cached.getBaseName    .equals baseName    {          if  verbose  {            System.out.println "found cached entry " +              Integer.toString i  +              " for " + baseName ;

        }        cached = new CachedConnection          Database.getConnection baseName , true, baseName ;         cachedConnections.add cached ;          numberConnections++;      }        if  monitor == null  {        monitor = new Thread           new Runnable     {            public void run     {              while numberConnections > 0  {                runMonitor    ;

       monitor.start    ;      }      return cached.getConnection    ;    }      synchronized public static void checkIn Connection c  {      boolean          found  = false;      boolean          closed = false;

   }  }  This sample caching object is quite lengthy, but I figure you want a working example, and this is  what it takes to get one. Let's start dissecting this class. To begin with, notice that the  CacheConnection class has several static attributes, and that all the methods are static as well.  That's because this utility class, like the Database class in Example 4-7, is never intended to  be instantiated in a servlet. The attributes in the class are:   verbose    A boolean used throughout the class's methods to turn diagnostic output on or off.  Diagnostic output is written to the standard output device.    numberConnections    cachedConnections    monitor    MAX_IDLE    An integer to keep track of the number of open connections in the cache.    A Vector object to contain the actual cache of connections.    A Thread object that runs independently of the CacheConnection object to manage  the removal of unused connections in the cache.    A long to hold the maximum time, in milliseconds, that an idle connection should remain  in the cache.     Now that you're familiar with the CacheConnection class's attributes, let's look at the class's  methods. In the discussion that follows, I'll work my way down from the top of the class listing and  discuss each method in turn.    At the top of the listing, you'll find a pair of overloaded checkOut    methods. The first  checkOut    method allocates a database connection from a default pool, while the second  allocates a connection from a pool specified by name. The default pool name used by the first  checkOut    method is "Database". To allocate a connection from that default pool, the first  checkOut    method simply calls the second checkOut    method, passing "Database" as  the pool name parameter. The second checkOut    method does all the real work. It looks in  the cache for a free connection with the corresponding pool name. If such a connection exists, it  is flagged as in use, and returned as the method's result. Otherwise, if no connection exists in the  specified pool, a new connection is created, placed into the cache, flagged as in use, and  returned as the method's result. Before returning any connection, the checkOut    method  checks if a monitor Thread object exists, creating one if necessary. I'll cover the function of this  monitor Thread object shortly.    The next method, checkIn   , is used by a servlet to return a connection to the cache when it  is no longer needed. Besides returning the connection to the cache, checkIn    verifies that  the connection is still open. This check is performed to allow a servlet to close a connection  should a catastrophic error occur. If the connection is no longer open, the CachedConnection  object that holds the connection is removed from the cache. By closing a bad connection and  then returning it to the cache, a servlet can permanently remove that connection from the cache,  thereby preventing another servlet from using it.    The CacheConnection class's checkUse    method is called by the runMonitor     method, which is in turn called by the monitor thread. The purpose of the checkUse     method is to close any connections that have been idle longer than the time period specified by  the MAX_IDLE attribute. The MAX_IDLE attribute specifies the maximum idle time in milliseconds.  In Example 4-8, I've specified a value that results in a maximum idle time of 60 minutes. If you  set the MAX_IDLE attribute to a lower value, such as 1000*60*2, or two minutes, you can easily  watch the monitor thread close idle connections.    The runMonitor    method invokes checkUse    to check the cache for idle connections.  The runMonitor    method then puts the Thread object to sleep for five minutes. After the  sleep interval, the runMonitor    method awakens, and the cycle repeats. When there are no  connections remaining in the cache, the monitor thread terminates.    The setVerbose    method allows you to control the display of debugging output. Calling  setVerbose    with an argument of true puts the CacheConnection class, as well as all  cached CachedConnection objects, into verbose mode. You'll have to activate this from one of  your servlets by calling CacheConnection.setVerbose true . This causes the  CacheConnection object to execute the various System.out.println    calls coded within  its methods. The resulting debug output is written to your servlet container's error log or to your  monitor screen, depending on how your servlet container is configured. Call setVerbose     with an argument of false to turn verbose mode off.    The final method is finalize     pun intended . When the servlet container is closed, the  finalize    method sweeps through the cache and closes any open connections.   4.2.4.4 A servlet that uses cached connections    Now that you understand the mechanics of the connection cache, let's put it to use. Example 4- 9 shows a servlet that implements a cached connection strategy using the three classes just  described. The servlet's name is CachedConnectionServlet.    As you read through the code for CachedConnectionServlet, note that there are three  significant differences between it and the SessionLogin servlet you should look for:    1.  The servlet turns on our Connection Manager's verbose output mode with a call to the   CacheConnection.setVerbose    method.    2.  The servlet allocates a cached connection by calling the   CacheConnection.checkOut    method. Here, the code is quite compact when  compared to the lengthy code required to manage a session connection.    3.  The servlet returns the checked-out connection by calling the checkIn    method.    In many respects, the cached connection strategy is very similar in implementation in the servlet  to the per-transaction strategy, except this time, we've reduced the cost of opening and closing  connections by reusing them.    Example 4-9. A cached connection servlet   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class CachedConnectionServlet extends HttpServlet {       public void doGet      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response        throws IOException, ServletException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;      PrintWriter out = response.getWriter    ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " Cached Connection Servlet " ;       out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;           Turn on verbose output      CacheConnection.setVerbose true ;           Get a cached connection      Connection connection = CacheConnection.checkOut    ;           Statement  statement  = null;      ResultSet  resultSet  = null;      String     userName   = null;        try {            Test the connection        statement = connection.createStatement    ;        resultSet = statement.executeQuery          "select initcap user  from sys.dual" ;        if  resultSet.next              userName = resultSet.getString 1 ;        }      catch  SQLException e  {        out.println "DedicatedConnection.doGet     SQLException: " +           e.getMessage     + " " ;      }      finally {        if  resultSet != null            try { resultSet.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }        if  statement != null            try { statement.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       }           Return the conection      CacheConnection.checkIn connection ;        out.println "Hello " + userName + "! " ;      out.println "You're using a cached connection! " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;    }      public void doPost      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response       throws IOException, ServletException {      doGet request, response ;    }  }  This last connection strategy provides the response time efficiency of session connections, while  at the same time reduces the number of simultaneous database connections to an on-demand  minimum. In practice, I've seen a caching implementation like this handle a web site with more  than 1,000 hits a day without ever having more than two simultaneous connections open. Now  that's a drastic improvement in the number of simultaneous connections used when compared to  the other three strategies.    Unfortunately, this strategy does not enable you to create transactions that span more than one  doXXX    method invocation. The reason you can't create such transactions is that you have no  guarantee of getting the same connection object from one doXXX    method call to the next.    So of the four connection strategies I've discussed in this chapter, which method should you  choose? Let's discuss that next.   4.3 Guidelines for Choosing a Connection Strategy  Of the four strategies outlined in this chapter, a cached connection strategy is best suited for  dynamic content that does not need to be kept secure -- for example, a public web site that  produces its content by retrieving information from a database. If you intend to use authentication  to limit your connection audience to a select group of users but don't need to keep track of who's  making changes to data, the cached connection strategy is still the most efficient. However, you'll  need to add a layer of code to your servlets to prompt the user for authentication and to verify  their credentials against an application-maintained list of valid users. You'll also need to store the  resulting authorization in a cookie or session object in order to maintain it from one servlet call to  the next. You can even use a cached connection for a form processing application, but you will  need to use an even more elaborate authenticate-and-store methodology. By the time you're  done adding all the extra code to your servlets to manage the authentication process, it may just  be easier to use a session connection.     If you have an application that requires a high level of security, then a session-based connection  is a better fit. One example of such an application is a medical application in which each  transaction needs to be logged to an audit trail showing who added or modified data. With a  session-based connection, you can have each application user log in using a distinct database  username and password. This facilitates audit logging, because you can use the auditing features  that come as part of the database itself, rather than writing your own. Using the database's  auditing facility also helps prevent any malicious tampering with the audit trail data.    For more information on writing servlets, I suggest you read Java Servlet Programming by Jason  Hunter and William Crawford  O'Reilly . You can also browse information about the reference  implementation servlet container, Tomcat, which I used to test the examples in this chapter, at  http:  www.apache.org.    Now that you have a solid background in servlet connections, lets take a look at connecting our  last type of client, an internal client such as a stored procedure or Enterprise JavaBeans, in  Chapter 5.   Chapter 5. Internal Database Connections  As you probably already know, the Oracle8i database engine includes an embedded JVM known  as the JServer. In this chapter, we'll explore the issues that are specific to using JDBC to connect  objects that reside in Oracle8i's internal JVM to a database. I say a database rather than the  database, because JDBC can be used to connect internally to the local database or externally to  another database. As in the other connection chapters, we'll cover the types of Oracle drivers  available. We'll also go over lots of examples to show each type of driver in use and talk about  the types of Java objects that the internal JVM supports. Let's begin our discussion by looking at  the Oracle drivers that are available for an internal client.   5.1 Server-Side Driver Types  To support the use of JDBC by Java code running within JServer, Oracle supplies the following  two server-side JDBC drivers:   Server-side internal driver    The server-side internal driver is used by stored procedures, EJB, or any other type of  object that resides in Oracle8i's internal JVM to establish a direct connection internally to  the local database. The server-side internal driver runs in the same memory space as the  database kernel, the SQL engine, and the JServer JVM. Any Java object that uses this  driver to connect to the database has the same default session as any PL SQL stored  procedure or SQL object. This driver has all the same APIs as the client-side drivers.    Server-side Thin driver    The server-side Thin driver can be used by stored procedures, EJB, and other objects to  access databases other than the one in which they are running. The server-side Thin  driver is, for all practical purposes, exactly the same as the client-side Thin driver, except  that it is an internal driver.    Now that you have an overview of what drivers are available, let's take a closer look at the server- side internal driver.   5.2 Using the Server-Side Internal Driver  As with the client-side drivers, when using the server-side internal driver you need to formulate an  appropriate database URL for use with the DriverManager.getConnection    method.  With the server-side internal driver you have two choices for a URL:     jdbc:oracle:kprb:  jdbc:default:connection:      The last colon characters on these URLs are necessary only  if you want them to work. I say this because I spent several  nights unsuccessfully trying to make either of these URLs  work. The documentation I was reading showed them used  without and with the colon. My preference was to leave off the  colon, hence my troubles. When I finally broke down and  used the colon on the end, the URLs worked. So, as I say:  the last colons on these URLs are necessary only if you want  them to work.       I recommend you use jdbc:oracle:kprb: as the database URL when connecting through the  server-side internal driver. It has the same basic format as the rest of the URLs we've used so  far, and you can use it with any form of the getConnection    method.    When you invoke getConnection    to connect through the server-side internal driver, any  unneeded parameters will be ignored. For example, if you pass a username and password, they  are simply ignored, because you are using a default connection. This default connection was  created when you connected to the database to invoke your stored Java program. This means  you can take a Java program you've written to load data into Oracle, change the driver type to  kprb, load it into the database, add an appropriate Java security policy to the database for file  access permissions, and execute the program without any major modifications. Using  getConnection    in this way is a good programming practice. It means you'll consistently use  the same methodology to connect to the database for both internal and external programs. This  will make it easier for you, and especially for the next guy or gal, to maintain your code.    The URL jdbc:oracle:kprb: is the most portable of internal URL syntaxes. For example,  since the driver type strings oci8, kprb, and thin all use the same relative position within the  URL, you can build a helper method that takes a driver type argument passed to your Java  program and use it to formulate a valid URL. This would be more difficult with the second internal  URL syntax: jdbc:default:connection:.    As an alternative to using the getConnection    method to open a database connection  through the server-side internal driver, you can use the  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver.defaultConnection    method. This method is  recommended by Oracle but is not portable and, oddly enough, is also deprecated  according to  Oracle's API documentation . I do not recommend it.   5.2.1 An Internal Driver Example  In order for me to show you an internal driver example, you will have to know how to load a  program into the Oracle database and publish it so it can be invoked from SQL or PL SQL. So  we'll cover these procedures in this section. By the time you're done reading this chapter you may  be wondering whether it's a chapter on internal connections or on writing stored procedures. Let  me assure you up front, this is a chapter about using internal connections, but that topic requires  that I show you how to load and publish a Java stored procedure. Accordingly, my explanations  for doing so are very terse. You can find detailed information on writing and loading Oracle Java  stored procedures in the Oracle8i Java Stored Procedures Developer's Guide available on the  Oracle Technology Network  OTN  web site.    There are three steps to making a Java program into a stored procedure.     1.  Compile Java source into a Java class file.   2.  Load the Java class file into the database.   3.  Publish the Java class as a stored procedure.   To get a better understanding of this process, begin by taking a look at Example 5-1, which is a  sample stored procedure written to test an internal connection.    Example 5-1. A stored procedure to test an internal connection   import java.sql.*;    class TestInternalConnection {      public static String getGreeting          throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {         With 8.1.6 there's no need to load the driver anymore,         but it doesn't hurt if you do      Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;       String greeting = null;      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:oracle:kprb:" ;       Statement  stmt = conn.createStatement    ;      ResultSet  rset = stmt.executeQuery        "select 'Hello 'initcap USER '!' result from dual" ;       if  rset.next              greeting = rset.getString 1 ;      rset.close    ;      stmt.close    ;      conn.close    ;      return greeting;      }  }  The first thing you should notice is that there is nothing remarkable about writing a Java stored  procedure. It is simply a Java class with one or more static methods. Our stored procedure,  TestInternalConnection, has one static method, getGreeting   , which returns the  username of the user executing the stored procedure. Next, notice that even though as of  Oracle8i Version 8.1.6, it is no longer necessary to explicitly load the driver, I do it anyway. Why?  Because it's good programming practice to be consistent in how you write Java programs,  regardless of whether they are internal or external. By always loading the driver, you can move  your programs to either environment without any changes except to the database URL. Lastly,  notice that I used the jdbc:oracle:kprb: database URL syntax.    Compile this source into a class file so we can move to the next step, which is to load it into the  database.    5.2.1.1 Loading a class file into a database   If you're going to execute a Java program as a stored procedure, then somehow it must get into  the database in order to be available from the database. For our examples, we'll use Oracle's  loadjava utility to accomplish this task. Accordingly, to load a class file into the database, use the  loadjava utility as follows:   loadjava -v -t -user username password@host:port:sid classfile  The -v switch turns on verbose output, the -t switch tells loadjava to use the Thin driver, -user  username password@host:port:sid identifies the destination database, and the last  parameter is the filename of the class to load. For example, to load    TestInternalConnection, you'll need to type a command such as the following at your  operating system's command prompt:   loadjava -v -t -user scott tiger@dssw2k01:1521:orcl  TestInternalConnection.class  Go ahead and try this command yourself. Be sure that you replace the username, password, and  other connection information with values that are appropriate for your environment.    5.2.1.2 Publishing a class   Now that you have TestInternalConnection loaded, you need to publish its getGreeting     method so you can call it as a stored procedure. To publish a Java stored procedure, you  create a SQL call specification to expose its methods to the rest of the database. Since a Java  class file is loaded into an Oracle database, it resides in what you could call, for lack of a better  term, a Java namespace. SQL objects, such as tables, PL SQL stored procedures, and the like  exist in a SQL namespace. That's why, even though your Java program resides in the database,  you still need to use JDBC to manipulate SQL objects. And from the other perspective, you need  some means to tell the SQL namespace that an internal Java program exists before you can  invoke one of the program's methods as a stored procedure.    In Oracle, you can create a stored procedure as a standalone function, as a standalone  procedure, or as a function or procedure that is part of a package. Accordingly, to create a  wrapper for a Java method, use the SQL CREATE FUNCTION or CREATE PROCEDURE syntax  or the keywords function or procedure in a package definition. You can execute the  CREATE command for the SQL call specification by typing the appropriate command in  SQL*Plus, but since this is a book about Java, we'll execute the DDL with a Java program  instead.    Example 5-2 is a Java application that creates a function call specification named  TIC_getGreeting for TestInternalConnection's getGreeting    method. The DDL  statement that PublishTestInternalConnection executes is:   create or replace function TIC_getGreeting return varchar2   as language java   name 'TestInternalConnection.getGreeting     return java.lang.String';   All that PublishTestInternalConnection does is connect to the database and execute the  DDL.    Example 5-2. An application to create a stored function call specification   import java.sql.*;    class PublishTestInternalConnection {      public static void main String[] argv      throws SQLException {      DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;      String sql = "create or replace function TIC_getGreeting " +                     "return varchar2 " +                    "as language java " +                    "name 'TestInternalConnection.getGreeting     "  +                    "return java.lang.String';";      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection        "jdbc:oracle:thin:dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       Statement  stmt = conn.createStatement    ;       long       rslt = stmt.executeUpdate sql ;        if  rslt==0          System.out.println "OK" ;      stmt.close    ;      conn.close    ;    }  }  Modify the database URL in Example 5-2 to a value appropriate for your installation. Then  compile the program. Next, execute the program from the command line. It will log into the  database and execute the SQL statement, creating the function TIC_getGreeting in the login  user's schema.    5.2.1.3 Executing a Java stored procedure   Now that you have your stored procedure ready, you can test it using the application shown in  Example 5-3. Once again, before running the example, modify the database URL to an  appropriate value for your environment. Next, compile the program and execute it. If all works  well, you should see output such as the following:   Hello Scott!  Impressive, isn't it? When CallTestInternalConnection is executed, it creates a  CallableStatement object that executes the SQL function TIC_getGreeting.  TIC_getGreeting in turn calls the Java stored procedure  TestInternalConnection.getGreeting   . The getGreeting    method retrieves the  user's username and returns the greeting to TIC_getGreeting, which returns it to  CallTestInternalConnection.   Example 5-3. A test application to call getGreeting      import java.sql.*;    class CallTestInternalConnection {      public static void main String[] argv      throws SQLException {      DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection        "jdbc:oracle:thin:dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall        "{?= call TIC_getGreeting}" ;      cstmt.registerOutParameter 1, Types.CHAR ;      long rslt = cstmt.executeUpdate    ;      if  rslt>0          System.out.println cstmt.getString 1  ;      cstmt.close    ;      conn.close    ;    }  }  5.2.2 Internal-Connection Considerations  Now that you understand how to establish an internal connection, there are four important  considerations to note. I describe these in the following sections. If you keep these considerations  in mind when writing both internal and external programs, you'll have no trouble moving those  programs into and out of the database.    5.2.2.1 You have only one connection    Any time you make a call to getConnection    , or to defaultConnection   , you are  actually getting the same default connection used by every other internal object, but you are  returned a new Connection object. Why is this distinction important? It becomes important only  if you will be using object-relational database objects and wish to use custom type maps. By  using multiple Connection objects, you can use custom type maps in each connection that will  in turn allow you to look at the same database object in different ways. I'll cover type maps in  Chapter 16. Just keep the fact that you can use different type maps on the same object by  opening an internal connection multiple times tucked away in the back of your mind in case you  need it someday.    5.2.2.2 Closing one of your connections closes all of your connections   Since every Connection object really represents the same connection, if you close any one of  your connections, you inadvertently close them all! Oracle recommends that you not close your  connections to avoid this problem. That bothers me. It sounds like an invitation to a bad habit, so I  close my connections at the end of my stored-procedure call. Do whatever you feel is  appropriate. I won't be there to say tsk-tsk, but consider the fact that if you make it a habit not to  close your connections in stored procedures, they will lose their portability, and you may end up  not closing your connections in applications, applets, and servlets simply out of habit.    5.2.2.3 Auto-commit is not supported   Auto-commit mode is disabled in the server. If you wish to do any transaction management in a  Java stored procedure, you will have to do it manually.    5.2.2.4 Additional methods are available for use in exception handlers   For code that runs in the JServer, there are two additional Oracle methods available with the  OracleSQLException object: getNumParameters    and getParameters   . These two  methods make the parameters that are normally passed when calling stored procedures available  inside the catch clause of an SQLException. These methods provide the following information:   int getNumParameters       Returns the numbers of parameters available   Object[] getParameters       Returns the parameter values   You will need to cast an SQLException object to an OracleSQLException object to use  these methods. For example:   . . .  catch  SQLException e  {  Int numParms =  OracleSQLException e.getNumParameters    ;  . . .  }  Now that we've covered the internal driver, let's take a look at using the server-side Thin driver to  connect to an external database.   5.3 Using the Server-Side Thin Driver  With the server-side Thin driver you now have two ways to connect to another Oracle database  from a Java program in an Oracle database. You can create a database link or use the server- side Thin driver. In my opinion, it's a much better solution to use database links than to use the  server-side Thin driver. With database links you get the following advantages:       Transparent distributed transaction management       Centralized administration of the database connection     Centralized database security   To access another database with the Thin driver, you need to use:      An XAConnection for distributed transaction management      An appropriate database URL in each Java object   However, you also open the database to security compromises. For example, to access an  Oracle database outside of the current database, you need to set up a SocketPermission  security policy to allow your Java program to open a socket to the external database. Once that  policy is created, any program can use it to open external connections. This also means that  external programs can access the current database without going through its authentication  system. That said, there may be times when an external connection using the Thin driver is the  right solution to a problem. So let's examine the use of the Thin driver by working through an  example.   5.3.1 A Server-Side Thin Driver Example   Example 5-4 contains a stored procedure that makes a connection to an external database  using the Thin driver. This stored procedure, TestExternalConnection, uses the same  database URL syntax that is used with the client-side Thin driver.    Example 5-4. A stored procedure to test an external connection   import java.sql.*;    class TestExternalConnection {      public static String getGreeting          throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {      Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;       String greeting = null;      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection        "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssnt01:1521:dssora01", "scott ", "tiger" ;      Statement  stmt = conn.createStatement    ;      ResultSet  rset = stmt.executeQuery        "select 'Hello 'initcap USER '!' result from dual" ;       if  rset.next              greeting = rset.getString 1 ;      rset.close    ;      stmt.close    ;      conn.close    ;      return greeting;      }  }  Compile the program and then load the class file by executing loadjava:   loadjava -v -t -user scott tiger@dssw2k01:1521:orcl  TestExternalConnection.class  Next, publish the stored procedure by compiling and executing Example 5-5.    Example 5-5. An application to publish TestExternalConnection   import java.sql.*;      class PublishTestExternalConnection {      public static void main String[] argv      throws SQLException {      DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;      String sql = "create or replace function TEC_getGreeting " +                     "return varchar2 " +                    "as language java " +                    "name 'TestExternalConnection.getGreeting     " +                     "return java.lang.String';";      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection        "jdbc:oracle:thin:dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       Statement  stmt = conn.createStatement    ;       long       rslt = stmt.executeUpdate sql ;      if  rslt==0          System.out.println "OK" ;      stmt.close    ;      conn.close    ;    }  }  Compile and execute Example 5-6 to ultimately invoke TestExternalConnection's  getGreeting    method. Invoking getGreeting    in turn tests the stored procedure's  ability to make an external connection.    Example 5-6. An application to execute TestExternalConnection   import java.sql.*;    class CallTestExternalConnection {      public static void main String[] argv      throws SQLException {      DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection        "jdbc:oracle:thin:dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall        "{?= call TEC_getGreeting}" ;      cstmt.registerOutParameter 1, Types.CHAR ;      long rslt = cstmt.executeUpdate    ;      if  rslt>0          System.out.println cstmt.getString 1  ;      cstmt.close    ;      conn.close    ;    }  }  What happened? You say it didn't work? Did you get output that looks something like the  following:   Exception in thread "main" java.sql.SQLException: ORA -29532: Java call  terminated by   uncaught Java exception: java.security.AccessControlException: the  Permission  java.  net.SocketPermission dssnt01 resolve  has not been granted by  dbms_java.grant_    permission to SchemaProtectionDomain SCOTTPolicyTableProxy SCOTT     ORA-06512: at "SCOTT.TEC_GETGREETING", line 0  ORA-06512: at line 1          at  oracle.jdbc.dbaccess.DBError.throwSqlException DBError.java:114            at oracle.jdbc.ttc7.TTIoer.processError TTIoer.java:208            at oracle.jdbc.ttc7.Oall7.receive Oall7.java, Compiled Code           at oracle.jdbc.ttc7.TTC7Protocol.doOall7 TTC7Protocol.java,  Compiled Code           at  oracle.jdbc.ttc7.TTC7Protocol.parseExecuteFetch TTC7Protocol.java:738            at  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.executeNonQuery Oracl eStatement.java,               Compiled Code           at  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.doExecuteOther OracleStatement.java:               1232           at  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.doExecuteWithBatch OracleStatement.               java:1353           at  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.doExecute OracleStatement.java:1760            at  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.doExecuteWithTimeout OracleStatement.               java:1805           at oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement.               executeUpdate OraclePreparedStatement.java:322           at  CallTestExternalConnection.main CallTestExternalConnection.java:12     It didn't work because, just like applets, internal clients run in a secure JVM, or "sand box," in  which they are not allowed access to operating-system resources without previously set up policy  entries that allow them to do so. And as with our remote connection applet from Chapter 2, you  need to add a SocketPermission policy for our stored procedure to work.   5.3.2 Database SocketPermission Policies  One way you can add a SocketPermission security policy to the database is to use the  packaged procedure SYS.DBMS_JAVA.GRANT_PERMISSION. GRANT_PERMISSION has the  following signature:   GRANT_PERMISSION  username, permission, target_name, actions    which breaks down as:  username    The owner or schema for which to grant the permission   The Java permission to grant   permission    target_name    actions    The permission's first parameter, or target name   The permission's second parameter, commonly a comma-delimited list of applicable  actions     You can find more detailed information about Java permissions in the JDK API documentation.  Now that you have an idea of how GRANT_PERMISSION works, let's proceed by creating a  SocketPermissions policy entry. To do this, we'll use yet another Java application. Example  5-7 is our policy creation program. In Policy-TestExternalConnection we grant the same  permission we set up for an applet in Chapter 3 to allow the user SCOTT to access a remote  database.    Example 5-7. An application to create socket permissions   import java.sql.*;    class PolicyTestExternalConnection {      public static void main String[] argv      throws SQLException {      DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection        "jdbc:oracle:thin:dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall        "{call sys.dbms_java.grant_permission" +        " 'SCOTT','java.net.SocketPermission'," +        "'dssnt01:1024-','connect,resolve' }" ;      long rslt = cstmt.executeUpdate    ;      if  rslt==0          System.out.println "OK" ;      cstmt.close    ;      conn.close    ;    }   }  Modify the database URL, username, and password as is appropriate for your environment. Then  compile and execute this program. PolicyTestExternalConnection uses the  SYS.DBMS_JAVA package's GRANT_PERMISSION procedure to add a SocketPermission  policy allowing schema SCOTT to access host dssnt01 using ports 1024 and higher.    Now try executing CallTestExternalConnection  Example 5-7  again. This time, it works!  If you think about it, accessing external resources through Java in a database opens up unlimited  possibilities for expanding the capabilities of the database. You can even go so far as accessing  another vendor's database. All you need to do is load the vendor's Type 4 driver and its support  files, and you can establish a connection.    Cancel    and setQueryTimeout    are not supported  by the server-side Thin driver.          Now that you have an understanding of the issues involved with using the server-side Thin driver,  let's finish this chapter with a discussion of the types of Java programs JServer can support.   5.4 JServer Program Support  Oracle states that you can run any Java program in JServer. This is not a false statement, but  since JServer does not support servlets in Version 8.1.6, you have to consider the usefulness of  what can be run.[1] You are really limited to two types of objects:    [1] Servlets are supposedly supported in Version 8.1.7.      Stored procedures    Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB     These refer to any Java object with a static method that can be wrapped with a SQL  function, procedure, or package.    These use JDBC but are not executed using JDBC. Instead, they are executed using the  IIOP protocol.    Since the use of JDBC by stored procedures and EJB is the same, I see no point in covering EJB  here. One thing worth noting about internal Java programs is what happens when you make calls  to System.out.println    and System.err.println   . Where does this output go?    By default, any calls to the methods System.out.println    and System.err.println     goes into a trace file. That's not very useful, but you can make the output go to the SQL*Plus  screen buffer. The SQL*Plus screen buffer is the buffer that the SYS.DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE  stored procedure uses. To send Java output to the SQL*Plus screen buffer, call the  SYS.DBMS_JAVA.SET_OUTPUT    stored procedure from within your Java stored procedure.  The syntax for doing that is:   SYS.DBMS_JAVA.SET_OUTPUT BUFFER_SIZE IN NUMBER   BUFFER_SIZE is an optional parameter. The default buffer size is 2,000 bytes, and the maximum  value is 1,000,000 bytes. Of course, the SQL*Plus buffer is useful only while using SQL*Plus. But  the buffer output when using SQL*Plus can be an invaluable troubleshooting tool during  development.    Example 5-8 is a stored procedure to test the use of SET_OUTPUT.  TestDbmsJavaSetOutput connects to the database using the driver type specified on the  command line. Since the static method main    is utilized for this stored procedure, you can  pass it a driver type at runtime. This allows you to test the procedure both externally and  internally. Next, the program uses a SELECT statement to retrieve the user's name. It turns on  the redirection of the System.out.println    method, which normally goes to stdout, by  executing the stored procedure SYS.DBMS_JAVA.SET_OUTPUT and passing it a buffer size of  10,000 bytes. Then, after closing the database connection, it calls the System.out.println     method, passing it a greeting using the user's name.   Example 5-8. A test of DBMS_JAVA.SET_OUTPUT   import java.sql.*;    class TestDbmsJavaSetOutput {      public static void main String[] args       throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {      Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;       String greeting = null;      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection        "jdbc:oracle:" + args[0] + ":", "scott", "tiger" ;       Statement  stmt = conn.createStatement    ;      ResultSet  rset = stmt.executeQuery        "select 'Hello 'initcap USER '!' result from dual" ;       if  rset.next             greeting = rset.getString 1 ;      rset.close    ;      stmt.close    ;      CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall        "{ call SYS.DBMS_JAVA.SET_OUTPUT  10000   }" ;        cstmt.execute    ;      cstmt.close    ;      conn.close    ;      System.out.println greeting ;    }  }  Compile the program and load its class file into the database by executing loadjava as follows:   loadjava -v -t -user scott tiger@dssw2k01:1521:orcl  TestDbmsJavaSetOutput.class  This time, we'll publish the Java stored procedure using SQL*Plus. So log into the database using  SQL*Plus and execute the following SQL statement to publish TestDbmsJavaSetOutput:   create or replace procedure TDJSO_main driver_type varchar2    as language java  name 'TestDbmsJavaSetOutput.main java.lang.String[] ';   This SQL statement creates a procedure: TDJSO_main driver_type varchar2 . Next, turn  on the SYS.DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE buffer for SQL*Plus by executing the following  command:   SQL> set serveroutput on size 10000;  Then execute TDJSO_main, passing it the string kprb in order to specify the internal driver type  by executing the following command at the SQL*Plus prompt:   SQL> execute TDJSO_main 'kprb' ;  Hello Scott!    PL SQL procedure successfully completed.  You can find more information about Java stored procedures in the Java Stored Procedures  Developer's Guide available on the OTN. You can find additional information about EJB in the  Enterprise JavaBeans and CORBA Developer's Guide, also available on the OTN, or in  Enterprise JavaBeans by Richard Monson-Haefel  O'Reilly .    Now that you know how to connect internal objects to the database using JDBC, let's move on to  the next chapter where we'll examine advanced security issues such as authentication, data  encryption, and data integrity.   Chapter 6. Oracle Advanced Security  So far, we have been discussing how to make connections to an Oracle database from  applications, applets, servlets, and internal objects . All these connections have had something in  common: they were all unsecured connections. With unsecured connections, someone intent on  malicious activity can intercept the information being passed between your client and server and  even modify it while in transit. Practically speaking, if you're using your application on a corporate  intranet, this should not be much of a concern. However, if you're using JDBC to connect to a  database over the Internet, the Oracle Advanced Security  ASO  option can protect your data's  privacy and integrity.    Oracle Advanced Security is a set of advanced security options, some of which are packaged  with Oracle Enterprise Edition, and some of which are purchased from a third party. They allow  you to create a secured connection to a database or use a more secure authentication scheme.  Oracle Advanced Security provides five security enhancements to JDBC connections:        Improved authentication using third-party authentication       Single sign-on using third-party authentication       Data privacy using encryption     Data integrity using message digests      Improved authorization using the Distributed Computing Environment  DCE     When using the OCI driver, all five of these enhancements are enabled by configuration settings  in the Oracle Client software. However, with the Thin driver, none of the authentication and  authorization enhancements are available. As for data privacy and integrity, the configuration  settings for these are sent to the Thin driver by using a properties object with getConnection    . So of the five security enhancements, only data privacy and integrity with the use of the Thin  driver are a concern for a programmer. Even so, let's start our discussion with authentication.   6.1 Authentication  The most common form of authentication, that is, proving that you are who you say you are, is  passwords. The OCI and Thin drivers implement the Oracle O3LOGON challenge-response  protocol. This requires a username and password. The OCI driver also supports third-party  authentication protocols such as Kerberos, RADIUS, or SecurID. However, the Thin driver  supports only O3LOGON. Nonetheless, it may be helpful to understand why third-party  authentication is needed in the first place. So let's take a look at the weaknesses of using  passwords.    The level of authentication security for a given username is equal to the effort involved in  guessing the user's password. Keeping that in mind, let's consider how people typically approach  password management.    Most people use easy-to-remember passwords, something they are familiar with, such as a family  member's name or a significant date or number. All of these are available to someone with  malicious intent, given a little effort. So all of these are easy-to-guess passwords, which provide a  low level of security.    To improve security, a person may decide to use a more complex password. But in doing so, he  may also make one of two related decisions that compromise security. First, he may decide to  use the same password everywhere. This exposes him to the risk that if the password is  guessed, a malicious user may use it to get access to all of his systems.    Another related problem is when someone in the password management facility at one site uses  another user's password stored at his site to gain access to that user's resources at another site.  From this second scenario, you can see that using the same password at every site is a  significant security risk.    A third problem with passwords is that, to improve security, a user may decide to use a different  complex password at every site. But he may then defeat that decision by writing them down to  remember them.    The third-party authentication services provided by Oracle Advanced Security addresses these  password weaknesses in various ways. If your Java program, such as an application or servlet,  can utilize the OCI driver, you can use third-party authentication to improve your system's  security. If you're using the Thin driver, you should remain hopeful, as I am, that the third-party  authentication services will be available in a future release of the product.   6.2 Data Encryption  Simply stated, data encryption equates to data privacy. A malicious user can use a network  sniffer to eavesdrop on network traffic. Without encryption, she can collect the network data in a  readable form as it is transmitted. If the data is encrypted using the RSA or DES cryptographic    algorithms, it can still be collected, but it will be unreadable. Data encryption must be enabled, or  requested, by both the client and the server for it to be used when a new connection is created.   6.2.1 Enabling Encryption on a Server  To enable data encryption on the server, you need to set the SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER  and SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER parameters in your server's sqlnet.ora file. The  syntax for setting these parameters is:   SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER = [REJECTED  ACCEPTED  REQUESTED  REQUIRED]   SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER =  type[,type...]     type ::= [DES40  RC4_40  DES  RC4_56  RC4_128]  which breaks down as:  SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER    Specifies the server's preference for whether encryption is used when new connections  are made. The following are valid values:    The server does not support encryption. Connections from clients requesting encryption  will be refused.    The server will accept a request from the client to support encryption.    The server will request encryption from the client.   The server requires encryption. If the client cannot support encryption, then the  connection will be refused.    SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER    Specifies the type, or types, of encryption that the server supports. Since you can specify  more than one value for this parameter, a value on the left takes precedence to a value  on the right during connection negotiation. You can choose from among one or more of  the following:    REJECTED    ACCEPTED    REQUESTED    REQUIRED    DES40    RC4_40    DES    RC4_56    RC4_128    Provides 40-bit DES encryption.   Provides 40-bit RSA encryption.   Provides 56-bit DES encryption.   Provides 40-bit RSA encryption.   Provides 128-bit RSA encryption. This is not available in Oracle software exported  outside the U.S.    For example, if you wish to require the use of encryption for all connections to your server and  support RC4_128 and RC4_56, place the following two lines in your server's sqlnet.ora file:     SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER = REQUIRED  SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER =  RC4_128,RC4_56   6.2.2 Enabling Encryption on a Client  How you enable encryption from the client depends on whether you are using the OCI driver or  the Thin driver. If you are using the OCI driver, the following properties must be set in the  sqlnet.ora file on the client:   SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT = [REJECTED  ACCEPTED  REQUESTED  REQUIRED]   SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT =  type[,type...]     type := [DES40  RC4_40  DES  RC4_56  RC4_128]  The meanings of these parameters and their settings are the same as they are for the  corresponding server-side parameters. If you are using the Thin driver and want to use  encryption, set the following properties in a Java Properties object passed to  getConnection   :   oracle.net.encryption_client    Specifies the client's encryption preference and can take on one of the following values:   REJECTED   ACCEPTED   REQUESTED   REQUIRED    oracle.net.encryption_types_client    Specifies the type of encryption requested and can take on one or more of the following  values in a comma-delimited list. The list must be enclosed within parentheses. The  possible values are:    DES40C    RC4_40    DES56C    RC4_56    Provides 40-bit DES encryption   Provides 40-bit RSA encryption   Provides 56-bit DES encryption   Provides 56-bit RSA encryption   The next two sections talk in more detail about the process of negotiating both the use of  encryption and the type of encryption to be used. In addition, you'll find a detailed example later in  this chapter in Section 6.4.   6.2.3 Negotiating the Use of Encryption  During the process of establishing a connection between a client and a server, the server  negotiates with the client to establish whether to activate encryption. The combination of the  client-side and server-side encryption settings determines the outcome of the negotiation during a  connection. Table 6-1 shows the outcome of the various combinations. For example, if a client's  setting is REQUESTED, and the server's is ACCEPTED, then a secured connection will be  created. However, if a client's setting is ACCEPTED and so is the server's, then the connection  will be successful, but the encryption will be off. At least one side must request encryption while  the other at least accepts it in order for encryption to be activated.     Table 6-1. Connection settings for encryption and integrity        Server:   REJECTED   Server:   ACCEPTED   Server:   REQUESTED   Server:   REQUIRED   Client: REJECTED  Off   Client:  ACCEPTED   Client:  REQUESTED   Off   Off   Client: REQUIRED  Fails   Off   Off   On   On   Off   On   On   On   Fails   On   On   On   6.2.4 Negotiating the Type of Encryption   Assuming that a request for a secured connection is accepted, a second set of properties must  be set to allow the type of encryption to be negotiated. On the server side,  SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER must be set to include one or more encryption types.  Accordingly, on the client side, and if you are using the OCI driver,  SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT must be set. If you are using the Thin driver on the  client side, you must set the property oracle.net.encryption_types_client in a Java  Properties object. You must then pass that Properties object to the Thin driver during a call  to the getConnection    method.    The values for the ENCRYPTION_TYPES properties specified in the sqlnet.ora file on both client  and server consist of a list of one or more encryption types separated by commas and enclosed  within parentheses. For example:   SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER =  RC4_128,RC4_56   The priority of which algorithm to use is determined from left to right in the list. So you should  specify the most desirable algorithm first, and then the second most desirable, and so on. During  the negotiation process, the server will select the most desirable match between the client and  server encryption types lists.    The Thin driver property oracle.net.encryption_types_client also requires that you  enclose the encryption algorithm within parentheses but supports only the selection of one  algorithm at this time. The parentheses exist for compatibility with a future release that will allow  you to specify more than one encryption algorithm. In addition, due to export regulations, the Thin  driver, which is the same set of class files for both import and export editions of the software,  does not support RC4_128  128-bit  encryption. Also, note that the literal value for specifying  DES is different for the Thin driver than for its OCI counterpart. Don't make the mistake of  specifying "DES40" or "DES" instead of "DES40C" or "DES56C" and then pull your hair out  because it doesn't work.    As an example of how the type of encryption is negotiated, consider the case in which a server's  setting is:   SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER =  RC4_128,RC4_56   Then assume a client is using the Thin driver with these settings:  Properties prop = new Properties    ;  prop.setProperty "user", "scott" ;  prop.setProperty "password", "tiger" ;    prop.setProperty "oracle.net.encryption_client", "REQUESTED" ;   prop.setProperty "oracle.net.encryption_types_client", "  RC4_56  " ;   The server will start the negotiation by requesting RC4_128 encryption. The client will in turn  respond that it cannot support RC4_128, so the server will then try the next type in the list, which  is RC4_56. The client will respond that it can support RC4_56 encryption, and a connection will  be established.    Next, we'll take a look at the second line of defense, data integrity.   6.3 Data Integrity  Data integrity ensures that a data packet from one end of a connection reaches the other end  unchanged. This prevents two additional types of malicious attacks: data tampering and replay.  Data tampering occurs when part of a data packet's contents are modified in transit. Replay is the  process of transmitting a valid transaction multiple times.    Data integrity is ensured using MD5 cryptographic checksums.[1] When you use Oracle Advanced  Security's data integrity facilities, a cryptographically secure message digest is created for, and  passed with, each data packet sent across the network. This message digest is a checksum  value that changes if any of the data in a data packet changes.    [1] With Oracle Advanced Security, the term  checksum is synonymous with the term integrity.   6.3.1 Enabling Data Integrity on a Server  To enable data integrity on a server, you need to set the  SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_SERVER and  SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER parameters in your server's sqlnet.ora file.  The syntax for setting these parameters is:   SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_SERVER=[REJECTED  ACCEPTED  REQUESTED   REQUIRED]  SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER= MD5   which breaks down as:  SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_SERVER    Specifies the server's preference for whether data integrity is used when new  connections are made. The following are valid values:    REJECTED    ACCEPTED    REQUESTED    REQUIRED    The server does not support data integrity. Connections from clients requesting data  integrity will be refused.    The server will accept a request from the client to support data integrity.    The server will request data integrity from the client.   The server requires data integrity. If the client cannot support data integrity, then the  connection will fail.    SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER    Specifies the type of checksum algorithm to use. This is a parenthesis list because more  than one algorithm may be supported in the future. However, only MD5 is supported at  this time.     6.3.2 Enabling Data Integrity on a Client  As with encryption, to enable data integrity on the client, the appropriate properties must be set in  the client's sqlnet.ora file if the OCI driver is used, or in a Java Properties object that is passed  to the getConnection    method if the Thin driver is used.    If you're using the OCI driver, use the following syntax in your sqlnet.ora file to specify data  integrity options:   SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_CLIENT=[REJECTED  ACCEPTED  REQUESTED   REQUIRED]  SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT= MD5   The definitions for these parameters are the same as those for the server. If you're using the Thin  driver and you want to enable data integrity, set the following properties in a Java Properties  object that you pass to getConnection   :   oracle.net.crypto_checksum_client    Specifies the client's data integrity preference. It can be one of the following values:   REJECTED   ACCEPTED   REQUESTED   REQUIRED    oracle.net.crypto_checksum_types_client    Specifies the checksum algorithm preference for the client, of which the only current valid  value is MD5.    6.3.3 Negotiating the Use of Data Integrity  During the process of establishing a connection, the server negotiates with the client to determine  whether to enable data integrity by using the same process as that used for encryption  which I  covered earlier in this chapter . There is only one cryptographic algorithm available at this time,  MD5. Still, it is necessary to surround the CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT parameter's  value with parentheses.   6.4 A Data Encryption and Integrity Example  Now that we've discussed both data encryption and integrity, let's see them in action. Example  6-1 is a sample application that uses the Thin driver to establish a secure database connection.    First, the program loads the Oracle Thin driver using the DriverManager.registerDriver     method. This method is chosen because the use of encryption and integrity is definitely an  Oracle extension, and therefore not portable. So why be concerned about using the  Class.forName    method, along with the extra coding that it requires, when portability is no  longer a concern?    Second, the program creates a Properties object named prop and then adds the required  properties. It adds the user and password properties because the form of getConnection     used with a Properties object does not take them as separate parameters. The program then  adds the oracle.net.encryption_client and  oracle.net.encryption_types_client properties to require 40-bit encryption. Next, the  program adds oracle.net.crypto_checksum_client and  oracle.net.crypto_checksum_types_client properties to require that MD5 message  digests be added to each packet.     Third, the program calls the getConnection String url, Properties info  form of the  getConnection    method. Then it finishes up in a manner similar to our previous connection  examples by querying the database. This is the kind of secured connection you would most likely  make for an applet. Alternatively, if you use an application or servlet, you would most likely use  the OCI driver, in which case, all these settings would be transparent to the program because  they would be set in the Oracle Client's sqlnet.ora file.    Example 6-1. A secure database connection application   import java.sql.*;  import java.util.*;    public class TestDataEncryptionIntegrity {     public static void main String[] argv      throws Exception {      DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver     ;       Properties prop = new Properties    ;    prop.setProperty "user", "scott" ;    prop.setProperty "password", "tiger" ;    prop.setProperty "oracle.net.encryption_client", "REQUIRED" ;    prop.setProperty "oracle.net.encryption_types_client", "  RC4_40  " ;     prop.setProperty "oracle.net.crypto_checksum_client", "REQUIRED" ;     prop.setProperty "oracle.net.crypto_checksum_types_client", "  MD5   " ;      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection      "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", prop ;    Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;    ResultSet rset = stmt.executeQuery      "select 'Hello Thin driver Encryption & Integrity " +      "tester 'USER'!' result from dual" ;    while rset.next           System.out.println rset.getString 1  ;    rset.close    ;    stmt.close    ;    conn.close    ;   }  }  Now that you know how to secure your connection's privacy and integrity, let's examine another  data encryption and integrity solution available to the OCI driver, the Secure Sockets Layer.   6.5 Secure Sockets Layer  Secure Sockets Layer  SSL  is an industry-standard protocol for secure authentication, data  encryption, and data integrity. With Version 8.1.6, SSL is supported only by the OCI driver. So  when you configure the Oracle Client and the Server's listener software to use SSL, data  encryption and integrity are transparently enabled, that is, as far as your Java programs are  concerned. It's just a matter of specifying a net service name configured to use SSL in your  database URL. Since the Thin driver does not yet support SSL, and may never support SSL  because of export laws, there's no need for a programmer to specify any properties, and  therefore, no need to show you an example. Nonetheless, it may be helpful to understand the  steps involved in configuring the Oracle Client and Server to use SSL. For testing purposes,  here's an outline of the activities required to configure your server for SSL:     1.  Use Oracle Wallet Manager to create a new Oracle wallet, which is an abstraction for a   X.509 certificate database.    2.   In Wallet Manager, create a certificate request using the fully qualified domain name of  your server's host as the common name.    3.  Export your certificate request and send it to a certificate authority along with the required   information to acquire a trusted certificate. For testing purposes, send your request to  VeriSign, which you can do at http:  digitalid.verisign.com server trial index.htm .  After VeriSign sends you your certificate via email, install the corresponding test root  certificate in Internet Explorer by going to  https:  digitalid.verisign.com server trial trialStep4.htm . The test root certificate  is distinct from the one you received via email. You'll want to use Internet Explorer to  receive the test root certificate from VeriSign, because you can then export the root  certificate by selecting Tools  Trusted  Roots, scrolling to "Issued To: for VeriSign Authorized testing only," and then selecting  Export. The result is an operating-system file. The reason you need to export the test root  certification is to make it available to Wallet Manager. At this point you have two  certificates: a user certificate in an email and a test root certificate in an operating-system  file.    Internet Options  Content  Certificates   4.  After you get your root certificate and your trusted user certificate for the certificate   request you created earlier, import them into your wallet using Wallet Manager. Import  the root certificate first and then the user certificate.    5.  Use Oracle Net8 Assistant to add the necessary parameters for SSL to your profile by  clicking on Local, then Profile from the hierarchy tree, then selecting Oracle Advanced  Security from the drop-down list box, and finally clicking on the SSL tab. You'll want to  specify the same Oracle Wallet directory you used when you created your wallet.    6.  Next, add an SSL listener on port 2484 to your listener by clicking on Local, then   Listeners, then LISTENER, then selecting Listening Locations from the drop-down list  box, and finally clicking on Add Address. Specify the protocol TCP with SSL, your fully  qualified hostname for host, and port 2484.    7.  Now for the client-side configuration. Run Oracle Net8 Assistant on your client. Add an  SSL net service name using port 2484 to your client by clicking on Local, then Service  Naming, then clicking on the Edit Create menu item. Specify a service name, a protocol  of TCP IP with SSL, your fully qualified hostname for the host, and port 2484.    8.  Last, and this is important on Windows NT or Windows 2000, go to the Services   Administrator, right click on the Oracle database service  which will be named  OracleServiceORCL or something similar , select properties, click on the Log On tab,  click on This Account, and specify the name of the user that owns the Oracle Wallet.    Once you have followed these steps, you can use an SSL database connection with the OCI  driver. There are no necessary changes to your Java programs, but, as I stated earlier, you are  limited for the time being to OCI driver support. SSL cannot be used from the Thin driver.    For all the gory details about Oracle Advanced Security, see the Oracle Advanced Security  Administrator's Guide available on the OTN.    Now that you can create secured connections, we'll take a look at our last connection topic,  Oracle's implementation of DataSources.   Chapter 7. JNDI and Connection Pooling    An object-oriented programming language derives its strength from two areas. First, you have the  constructs of the programming language itself that allow you to write well-structured objects to  extend that language. Second, you have the extensive libraries of APIs that have been written to  provide standard functionality. Think for a moment about how APIs are created. A software  engineer does not just wake up one morning and have an entire API worked out in every detail.  Instead, an API's design is based on the experiences of professionals like you, who, over time,  have gained insight through problem solving as to what is needed in an API to make it a useful  part of developing an application. Accordingly, over time, an API evolves through this community  process to better fit the needs of the programming community.    When it comes to the JDBC API, specifically the DriverManager facility, there is an evolution  taking place. In Chapter 4, we needed to put a significant amount of code around  DriverManager to implement a sharable connection facility. It took even more work to make our  sharable connections cacheable. With the Java 2 Enterprise Edition  J2EE , a framework has  been defined for sharing and caching connections. This framework is the JDBC 2.0 Extension  API. In this chapter, we'll cover the JDBC 2.0 Extension API, which is a another set of JDBC  interfaces, along with Oracle's implementation of these interfaces. We'll also look at a functional  caching object using Oracle's connection caching implementation. Let's begin our journey through  the new API with a look at the generic source for database connections, the DataSource class.   7.1 DataSources  A DataSource object is a factory for database connections. Oracle's implementations of data  sources are database connection objects that encapsulate the registration of the appropriate  database driver and the creation of a connection using predetermined parameters. DataSource  objects are typically bound with the Java Naming and Directory Interface  JNDI , so they can be  allocated using a logical name at a centrally managed facility such as an LDAP directory.   7.1.1 OracleDataSources   Oracle implements the DataSource interface with class OracleDataSource. Table 7-1 lists  the standard properties implemented by a DataSource object.    Table 7-1. Standard DataSource properties    Property   Data type   Description   networkProtocol    For OCI driver, determines the protocol used   databaseName    dataSourceName    description    password    portNumber    serverName    user    String   String   String   String   String   int   String   String   Oracle SID   Name of the underlying DataSource class   Description of the DataSource   Oracle password   Oracle listener port number   DNS alias or TCP IP address of the host   Oracle username    DataSource properties follow the JavaBeans design pattern, and therefore, the following  getter setter methods are in a DataSource object:   public synchronized void   setDatabaseName String databseName    public synchronized String getDatabaseName      public synchronized void   setDataSourceName String dataSourceName    public synchronized String getDataSourceName      public synchronized void   setDescription String description    public synchronized String getDescription      public synchronized void   setNetworkProtocol String networkProtocol    public synchronized String getNetworkProtocol      public synchronized void   setPassword String password    public synchronized void   setPortNumber int portNumber    public synchronized int    getPortNumber      public synchronized void   setServerName String ServerName    public synchronized String getServerName      public synchronized void   setUser String user   public synchronized String getUser      The OracleDataSource class has an additional set of proprietary attributes. These are listed in  Table 7-2.    Table 7-2. OracleDataSource properties    Property   Data  type   Description   kprb for server-side internal connections   driverType   String   oci8 for client-side OCI driver   thin for client- or server-side Thin driver   url    String  A convenience property incorporating properties, such as   PortNumber, user, and password, that make up a database URL    tnsEntryName String  TNS names address for use with the OCI driver   And these are the OracleDataSource property getter setter methods:   public synchronized void   setDriverType String dt   public synchronized String getDriverType      public synchronized void   setURL String url   public synchronized String getURL      public synchronized void   setTNSEntryName String tns    public synchronized String getTNSEntryName      Common sense prevails with these settings. For example, there is no getPassword    method,  because that would create a security problem. In addition, the properties have a specific  precedence. If you specify a url property, then any properties specified in the url override  those that you specify by any of the other setter methods. If you do not set the url property but  instead specify the tnsEntryName property, then any related setter methods are overridden by  the values in the TNS entry name's definition. Likewise, if you are using the OCI driver and  specify a network protocol of IPC, then any communication properties are ignored because the  IPC protocol establishes a direct connection to the database. Finally, a username and password  passed in the getConnection    method override those specified in any other way. Note that  you must always specify a username and password with whatever means you choose.     7.1.2 Getting a Connection from a DataSource  To get a connection from a DataSource use one of the two available getConnection     methods:   public Connection  getConnection       throws SQLException  public Connection  getConnection String username, String password     throws SQLException  The first method creates a new Connection object with the username and password settings  from the DataSource. The second method overrides the username and password in the  DataSource.    Now that you have an understanding of data sources, let's look at Example 7-1, which is an  application to test the Thin driver using a DataSource.   Example 7-1. An application using a DataSource to connect   import java.sql.*;  import oracle.jdbc.pool.*;         class TestThinDSApp {     public static void main  String args[]      throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {         These settings are typically configured in JNDI,       so they are implementation-specific    OracleDataSource ds = new OracleDataSource     ;    ds.setDriverType "thin" ;    ds.setServerName "dssw2k01" ;    ds.setPortNumber 1521 ;    ds.setDatabaseName "orcl" ;    sid    ds.setUser "scott" ;    ds.setPassword "tiger" ;      Connection conn = ds.getConnection    ;      Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;    ResultSet rset = stmt.executeQuery      "select 'Hello Thin driver data source tester '" +        "initcap USER '!' result from dual" ;    if  rset.next           System.out.println rset.getString 1  ;    rset.close    ;    stmt.close    ;    conn.close    ;   }  }  First, our test application, TestThinDSApp, creates a new OracleDataSource object and then  initializes its properties that are relevant to the Thin driver. The OracleDataSource object  implements the DataSource interface, so OracleDataSource is also considered to be a  DataSource object. Next, the program gets a connection from the DataSource using the  getConnection    method. Finally, just to prove everything is working OK, the application  queries the database, and closes the connection.     So what have we accomplished using an OracleDataSource object? Recall that in Chapter 4  we established a connection using the following code:   Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;    Connection conn =    DriverManager.getConnection     "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl","scott","tiger" ;   Now, using an OracleDataSource object, our code to establish a connection looks like:   OracleDataSource ds = new OracleDataSource    ;  ds.setDriverType "thin" ;  ds.setServerName "dssw2k01" ;  ds.setPortNumber 1521 ;  ds.setDatabaseName "orcl" ;    sid  ds.setUser "scott" ;  ds.setPassword "tiger" ;    Connection conn = ds.getConnection    ;  What's going on here? Our code is actually longer, which doesn't seem to improve things much,  does it? But from another perspective, using a DataSource does represent an improvement,  because a DataSource implements the Serializable interface, which means it can be bound  using JNDI to a directory service. What does that mean? It means we can define our connection  parameters once, in one place, and use a logical name to get our connection from JNDI. How  does this help us? Let's say, for example, that we have 1,000 programs that use the specific  connection parameters shown in Example 7-1. Let's further assume that we now have to move  our database to another host. If you wrote your programs using the DriverManager facility,  you'll need to modify and compile all 1,000 programs. However, if you used a DataSource  bound to a directory using JNDI, then you need to change only one entry in the directory, and all  the programs will use the new information.   7.1.3 Using a JNDI DataSource  Let's take a look at a couple of sample applications that illustrate the power and utility of using  data sources that are accessed via JNDI. The examples use Sun's file-based JNDI  implementation. You can download the class files for Sun's JNDI filesystem implementation at  http:  java.sun.com products jndi index.html.    First, the program in Example 7-2, TestDSBind, creates a logical entry in a JNDI directory to  store our DataSource. It uses Sun's JNDI filesystem implementation as the directory. After that,  we'll look at another program that uses the DataSource created by the first.    My DataSource bind program, TestDSBind, starts by creating a Context variable named  ctx. Next, it creates a Properties object to use in initializing an initial context. In layman's  terms, that means it creates a reference to the point in the local filesystem where our program  should store its bindings. The program proceeds by creating an initial Context and storing its  reference in ctx. Next, it creates an OracleDataSource and initializes its properties. Why an  OracleDataSource and not a DataSource? You can't really use a DataSource for binding;  you have to use an OracleDataSource, because the setter getter methods for the properties  are implementation- or vendor-specific and are not part of the DataSource interface. Last, the  program binds our OracleDataSource with the name joe by calling the Context.bind     method.    Example 7-2. An application that binds a JNDI DataSource   import java.sql.*;    import java.util.*;  import javax.naming.*;  import oracle.jdbc.pool.*;    public class TestDSBind {     public static void main  String args []     throws SQLException, NamingException {           For this to work you need to create the       directory  JNDI JDBC on your filesystem first    Context ctx = null;    try {     Properties prop = new Properties    ;      prop.setProperty        Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,        "com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory" ;      prop.setProperty        Context.PROVIDER_URL,        "file: JNDI JDBC" ;     ctx = new InitialContext prop ;    }     catch  NamingException ne  {     System.err.println ne.getMessage     ;    }      OracleDataSource ds = new OracleDataSource    ;    ds.setDriverType "thin" ;    ds.setServerName "dssw2k01" ;    ds.setPortNumber 1521 ;    ds.setDatabaseName "orcl" ;    ds.setUser "scott" ;    ds.setPassword "tiger" ;      ctx.bind "joe", ds ;   }  }  Create a directory, JNDI, on your hard drive, and then create a subdirectory, JDBC, in your JNDI  directory. Compile Example 7-2 and execute it. Assuming you get no error messages, you  should find a bindings file in your new JDBC subdirectory. This file holds the values for a  serialized form of your DataSource logically named joe. This means that we can later retrieve a  new connection by referencing a resource named joe.    Now that we have a directory entry, let's test it with our next program, TestDSLookup, in  Example 7-3. First, TestDSLookUp creates an initial context just like TestDSBind did. Next, it  uses the Context.lookup    method to look up and instantiate a new DataSource from our  serialized version of joe. Finally, the program queries the database and closes the connection.  Pretty cool huh? When using DriverManager, you typically must specify the JDBC driver and  database URL in your source code. By using a DataSource together with JNDI, you can write  code that is independent of a JDBC driver and of a database URL.    Example 7-3. An application that uses a JNDI DataSource   import java.sql.*;  import javax.sql.*;  import javax.naming.*;    import java.util.*;    public class TestDSLookUp {     public static void main  String[] args     throws SQLException, NamingException {      Context ctx = null;    try {     Properties prop = new Properties    ;     prop.setProperty       Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,      "com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory" ;     prop.setProperty       Context.PROVIDER_URL,       "file: JNDI JDBC" ;     ctx = new InitialContext prop ;    }     catch  NamingException ne  {     System.err.println ne.getMessage     ;    }      DataSource ds =  DataSource ctx.lookup "joe" ;    Connection conn = ds.getConnection    ;    Statement  stmt = conn.createStatement    ;    ResultSet  rset = stmt.executeQuery      "select 'Hello Thin driver data source tester '" +        "initcap USER '!' result from dual" ;    if  rset.next          System.out.println rset.getString 1  ;    rset.close    ;    stmt.close    ;    conn.close    ;   }  }  7.1.4 Caveats  I hope you can appreciate the long-term gain of using DataSources with JNDI rather than  embedding connections in your code:    It makes your code independent of a JDBC driver.   It makes your code independent of a database URL.               It allows you to look up the driver and URL in one operation from anywhere on the  network.    DataSource objects do, however, have a few drawbacks. One is that you can't use Oracle  Advanced Security with the Thin driver, because there is no way to set the oracle.net  properties for data encryption and integrity. This is because oracle.net properties are not a  part of the standard, nor are they part of Oracle's implementation-specific set of DataSource  properties. Another drawback to using DataSources is that you have to make the investment in  an LDAP directory to truly leverage the use of JNDI, and that can be quite costly.    In addition to the drawbacks I've mentioned, there are a few DataSource behaviors you should  be aware of. One concerns the logging feature. There are two methods you can use to set and    get the log writer for a DataSource. A log writer is a PrintWriter object used by the driver to  write its activities to a log file. They are:   public synchronized void setLogWriter PrintWriter pw     throws SQLException  public synchronized PrintWriter getLogWriter       throws SQLException  As with the DriverManager facility, logging is disabled by default. You will always need to call  the setLogWriter    method after a DataSource has been instantiated, even if you set the  log writer before you bind it to a directory. Why? Because the PrintWriter you specify in the  setLogWriter    method is transient and therefore cannot be serialized. A second behavior  you should be aware of is that when DataSource logging is enabled, it bypasses  DriverManager's logging facility.    There are also two methods you can use to set and get the login timeout, which is the amount of  time that an idle connection should be kept open. The methods are:   public synchronized void setLoginTimeout int seconds                        throws SQLException  public synchronized int  getLoginTimeout       throws SQLException  Now that you have a firm grasp of how and when to use a DataSource object, let's continue our  investigation of the JDBC 2.0 Extension API with a look at the connection pooling interface  ConnectionPoolDataSource.   7.2 Oracle's Connection Cache  Recall that in Chapter 4 we talked about a cached pool of connections used by servlets. When a  servlet needed a connection, it drew one from the pool. The servlet did its work, and when it was  done, it returned the connection back to the pool. The benefit of using cached connections is that  a servlet does not need to go through the resource-intensive task of opening a new database  connection each time the servlet is invoked. Also in Chapter 4, I showed a rudimentary  connection caching tool. Rudimentary as it was, it still required a fair bit of rather complex code to  implement. As part of the JDBC 2.0 Extension API, Oracle provides a ready-made connection  cache interface along with a sample implementation. Instead of wasting your precious time doing  something that has already been done for you, you can use Oracle's connection cache  immediately and in turn concentrate on the business problem at hand.    At the heart of Oracle's connection caching framework is the connection pool data source. It's  important you understand what that is and how it works before getting into the details of the  connection cache framework itself.   7.2.1 ConnectionPoolDataSources  A ConnectionPoolDataSource is a DataSource that can be pooled. Instead of returning a  Connection object as a DataSource object does, a ConnectionPoolDataSource returns a  PooledConnection object. A PooledConnection object itself holds a physical database  connection that is pooled. In turn, a PooledConnection returns a Connection object. This  single layer of indirection allows a ConnectionPoolDataSource to manage  PooledConnection objects.    You can use a PooledConnection to add or remove ConnectionEventListeners. A  ConnectionEventListener is any Java program thread that wishes to be notified whenever a  connection is opened or closed. When a Connection is received from or returned to a  PooledConnection, the appropriate ConnectEvent event is triggered to close or return the    Connection object to its associated pool. In this case, the Connection object is not the same  implementation of the Connection interface utilized by DriverManager. Instead, it's a logical  implementation managed by the PooledConnection object.    The ConnectionPoolDataSource interface is implemented by the class Oracle- ConnectionPoolDataSource, which extends OracleDataSource. This means that all the  methods from the OracleDataSource class and ConnectionPoolDataSource interface are  available in an OracleConnectionPoolDataSource.    The OraclePooledConnection class implements the PooledConnection interface and also  provides the following five constructors:   public OraclePooledConnection       throws SQLException  public OraclePooledConnection String url    throws SQLException  public OraclePooledConnection String url, String user, String passw ord    throws SQLException  public OraclePooledConnection Connection pc   public OraclePooledConnection Connection pc, boolean autoCommit    The OracleConnectionEventListener class implements the ConnectionEventListener  interface. It also provides the following two constructors and one additional method:   public OracleConnectionEventListener      public OracleConnectionEventListener DataSource ds   public void setDataSource DataSource ds   Collectively, these JDBC classes and interfaces, along with Oracle's implementation of them,  provide a framework for connection caching. However, the topic of how they can be used to build  a connection cache is well beyond the scope of this book. Besides, Oracle already provides a  connection cache interface and sample implementation. Let's look at how you can leverage those  in your programs.   7.2.2 Connection Cache Implementation  Let's start our discussion of Oracle's connection cache implementation by defining a few  important terms:   Connection pool    A pool of one or more Connections that use the same properties to establish a physical  connection to a database. By "properties," I mean things such as databaseName,  serverName, portNumber, etc.    Connection cache    Pooled connection cache    A cache of one or more physical connections to one or more databases.    A cache of one or more connections to the same database for the same username.    Oracle's connection cache interface is named OracleConnectionCache. Together, the  interface and its implementation provide a cache of physical connections to a particular database  for a specified username.    7.2.2.1 The OracleConnectionCache interface   Oracle's OracleConnectionCache interface defines the following three methods to aid you in  managing a connection pool cache:     public void close       throws SQLException  public void closePooledConnection PooledConnection pc     throws SQLException  public void reusePooledConnection PooledConnection pc     throws SQLException  These methods perform the following functions:  close       Used to close a logical connection to the database obtained from a Pooled- Connection. A logical connection is a connection that has been allocated from a pool.  When a logical connection is closed, the connection is simply returned to the pool. It may  physically remain open but is logically no longer in use.    closePooledConnection       reusePooledConnection       Used to remove the associated PooledConnection from a connection pool.    Used to return a PooledConnection to a connection pool.    7.2.2.2 The OracleConnectionCacheImpl class   The OracleConnectionCacheImpl class extends OracleDataSource and implements the  OracleConnectionCache interface. Beyond what OracleConnectionCacheImpl inherits  from OracleDataSource and the methods it implements from the OracleConnectionCache  interface, the OracleConnectionCacheImpl class provides the following constants,  constructors, and methods:   public final int DYNAMIC_SCHEME  public final int FIXED_RETURN_NULL_SCHEME  public final int FIXED_WAIT_SCHEME  public OracleConnectionCacheImpl       throws SQLException   public OracleConnectionCacheImpl ConnectionPoolDataSource cpds     throws SQLException   public int  getActiveSize      public int  getCacheSize      public void setCacheScheme int cacheScheme ;  public int  getCacheScheme      public void setConnectionPoolDataSource ConnectionPoolDataSource cpds    throws SQLException  public void setMinLimit int minCacheSize   public int  getMinLimit      public void setMaxLimit int maxCacheSize   public int  getMaxLimit      The first three constants are used with the setCacheScheme    method to specify the caching  scheme to be used by a given connection cache implementation. Caches usually employ a  minimum and maximum number of connections as part of a resource strategy. The minimum  value keeps a minimum number of connections on hand to speed up the connection process. A  cache uses the maximum value to limit the amount of operating-system resources utilized. This  prevents the cache from growing beyond its host's ability to provide resources. The  setCacheScheme    method's constants control the behavior of the cache when the specified  maximum connection limit has been exceeded. The values are defined as follows:   DYNAMIC_SCHEME     The cache will create connections above the specified maximum limit when necessary  but will in turn close connections as they are returned to the cache until the number of  connections is within the maximum limit. Connections will never be cached above the  maximum limit. This is the default setting.    FIXED_RETURN_NULL_SCHEME    The cache will return a null connection once the maximum connection limit has been  exceeded.    FIXED_WAIT_SCHEME    The cache will wait until there is a connection available and will then return it to the  calling application.    The OracleConnectionCacheImpl class implements two constructor methods, and there are  three ways that you can use them to initialize a cache:    1.  You can use the default constructor and set the connection properties individually after   you've instantiated an object of the class.    2.  You can use the default constructor to instantiate an object of the class. Then you can  create a ConnectionPoolDataSource object, initialize it, and pass it as a parameter  to the setConnectionPoolDataSource    method.    3.  You can create and initialize a ConnectionPoolDataSource object and then pass it   as a parameter to the second form of the OracleConnectionCacheImpl constructor.    The other methods implemented by the OracleConnectionCacheImpl class are  straightforward getter and setter methods. They do exactly what their names indicate.   7.2.3 A Connection Caching Example  Now that you have an idea of what an OracleConnectionCacheImpl object can do, let's  rewrite our caching object from Chapter 4 using Oracle's caching implementation. We'll build a  new caching object named OCCIConnection that will use the OracleConnectionCacheImpl  class to create a modular caching module. The overall development process that we'll follow for  this example is:    1.  We'll create a program that allows us to create a connection pool data source and bind it   to our JNDI directory.    2.  We'll create a class to implement and manage connection caches.   3.  We'll test the connection cache using one servlet that retrieves and uses connections and   another that displays the current status of the cache.    7.2.3.1 Creating and binding a ConnectionPoolDataSource   In my opinion, there's no advantage to using a DataSource unless you also utilize JNDI, so our  examples here will once again use Sun's filesystem implementation of JNDI. First, we'll create a  program named OCCIBind, shown in Example 7-4, to bind a ConnectionPoolDataSource  to our JNDI directory. OCCIBind is similar to the TestDSBind program shown in Example 7-2,  but this time, we bind an OraclePoolConnectionSource.   Example 7-4. An application that binds a ConnectionPoolDataSource   import java.sql.*;  import java.util.*;    import javax.naming.*;  import oracle.jdbc.pool.*;    public class OCCIBind {     public static void main  String args []     throws SQLException, NamingException {        Context context = null;    try {     Properties properties = new Properties    ;      properties.setProperty        Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,        "com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory" ;      properties.setProperty        Context.PROVIDER_URL,        "file: JNDI JDBC" ;     context = new InitialContext properties ;    }     catch  NamingException ne  {     System.err.println ne.getMessage     ;    }      OracleConnectionPoolDataSource ocpds =      new OracleConnectionPoolDataSource    ;    ocpds.setDescription "Database" ;    ocpds.setDriverType "thin" ;    ocpds.setServerName "dssw2k01" ;    ocpds.setPortNumber 1521 ;    ocpds.setDatabaseName "orcl" ;    ocpds.setUser "scott" ;    ocpds.setPassword "tiger" ;      context.bind ocpds.getDescription    , ocpds ;   }  }  Make sure that the JDBC subdirectory exists under the JNDI directory on your hard drive. Then  compile and execute the program. Once again, you can find the serialized values of our newly  bound OracleConnectionPoolDataSource in a file named .bindings in the JDBC  subdirectory.    7.2.3.2 Creating the connection manager   Next, we'll create the OCCIConnection class in Example 7-5. This class uses static methods  so it can perform its functionality without being instantiated. It instantiates a  OracleConnectionCacheImpl object to manage the connection pools. When a connection is  requested, any existing pools are searched first. If a matching connection pool cannot be found,  then a new OracleConnectionCacheImpl is created to hold connections for the new pool.   Example 7-5. An OracleConnectionCacheImpl caching implementation   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.util.*;  import javax.naming.*;  import javax.sql.*;  import oracle.jdbc.pool.*;      public class OCCIConnection {   private static boolean verbose               = false;   private static int     numberImplementations = 0;   private static Vector  cachedImplementations = new Vector    ;      public synchronized static Connection checkOut     {     return checkOut "Database" ;   }     public synchronized static Connection checkOut String baseName  {    boolean                   found      = false;    OracleConnectionCacheImpl cached     = null;     Connection                connection = null;    if  verbose  {     System.out.println "There are " +       Integer.toString numberImplementations  +       " connections in the cache" ;     System.out.println "Searching for a matching implementation..." ;     }    for  int i=0;!found && i<numberImplementations;i++  {      if  verbose  {      System.out.println "Vector entry " + Integer.toString i  ;     }     cached =  OracleConnectionCacheImpl cachedImplementations.get i ;      if  cached.getDescription    .equals baseName   {       if  verbose  {       System.out.println "found cached entry " +         Integer.toString i  +         " for " + baseName ;      }      found = true;     }    }    if  !found  {     if  verbose  {      System.out.println "Cached entry not found " ;      System.out.println "Allocating new entry for " + baseName ;      }     try {      cached = new OracleConnectionCacheImpl        getConnectionPoolDataSource baseName  ;      cached.setDescription baseName ;      cachedImplementations.add cached ;      numberImplementations++;     }     catch  SQLException e  {      System.err.println e.getMessage     +        " creating a new implementation for " + baseName ;     }    }    if  cached != null  {     try {      connection = cached.getConnection    ;     }     catch  SQLException e  {      System.err.println e.getMessage     +          " getting connection for " + baseName ;     }    }    return connection;   }     public static ConnectionPoolDataSource     getConnectionPoolDataSource String baseName  {    Context                  context = null;    ConnectionPoolDataSource cpds    = null;    try {     Properties properties = new Properties    ;     properties.setProperty       Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,      "com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory" ;     properties.setProperty       Context.PROVIDER_URL,      "file: JNDI JDBC" ;     context = new InitialContext properties ;     cpds   =  ConnectionPoolDataSource context.lookup baseName ;    }    catch  NamingException e  {     System.err.println e.getMessage     +       " creating JNDI context for " + baseName ;    }    return cpds;   }     protected static synchronized void checkIn Connection c  {     try {     c.close    ;    }    catch  SQLException e  {     System.err.println e.getMessage     +       " closing connection" ;    }   }     public static String[] getReport     {    int line = 0;    String[] lines = new String[numberImplementations * 7];     OracleConnectionCacheImpl cached = null;         for  int i=0;i < numberImplementations;i++  {     cached =  OracleConnectionCacheImpl cachedImplementations.get i ;      lines[line++] = cached.getDescription     + ":";     switch  cached.getCacheScheme      {      case OracleConnectionCacheImpl.DYNAMIC_SCHEME:       lines[line++] = "Cache Scheme  = DYNAMIC_SCHEME";        break;      case OracleConnectionCacheImpl.FIXED_RETURN_NULL_SCHEME:        lines[line++] = "Cache Scheme  = FIXED_RETURN_NULL_SCHEME";        break;      case OracleConnectionCacheImpl.FIXED_WAIT_SCHEME:       lines[line++] = "Cache Scheme  = FIXED_WAIT_SCHEME";        break;     }       lines[line++] = "Minimum Limit = " +      Integer.toString cached.getMinLimit     ;     lines[line++] = "Maximum Limit = " +      Integer.toString cached.getMaxLimit     ;     lines[line++] = "Cache Size    = " +      Integer.toString cached.getCacheSize     ;     lines[line++] = "Active Size   = " +      Integer.toString cached.getActiveSize     ;     lines[line++] = " ";    }    return lines;   }     public static void setVerbose boolean v  {    verbose = v;   }    }  Our caching object, OCCIConnection, has an overloaded checkOut    method. The first form  of the method takes no argument. It uses the default logical name of "Database", passing it to the  second form to allocate from or create an OracleConnectionCacheImpl object. The second  form of the checkOut    method scans through a Vector of implementations looking for a  match. If one is found, it returns a connection from the OracleConnectionCacheImpl object.  If a matching implementation, i.e., Oracle-ConnectionCacheImpl object, is not found, then  the method creates a new one, stores its reference in the implementation Vector object, and  returns a Connection. When the application calls the checkIn    method, the  OracleConnectionCacheImpl returns the connection to the cache. The getReport     method returns a String array that contains a report on the current status of each  implementation. The last method, setVerbose   , allows the developer to send diagnostics to  standard out. I've written this object to get a ConnectionPoolDataSource from a directory  when an implementation is not found in the Vector, but we could have set it up to get an  OracleConnectionCacheImpl object instead.   7.2.3.3 Testing our connection cache   OCCIConnectionServlet, shown in Example 7-6, tests the cache by requesting a default  connection. This servlet, similar to its counterpart in Chapter 4, checks out a connection, queries  the database, and checks in the connection. However, notice that we've added a pair of tight for  loops to delay the servlet's completion. This is so you can click on your browser's Reload button  several times to force the cache to open multiple connections. Compile this servlet and place it in  an appropriate classes directory on your servlet container. Compile the OCCIConnection object  from Example 7-5 and place it in the same directory.    Example 7-6. A servlet that tests the caching implementation   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class OCCIConnectionServlet extends HttpServlet {     public void doGet     HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response        throws IOException, ServletException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter    ;    out.println " " ;    out.println " " ;    out.println      " Oracle Cached Connection Implementation Servlet " ;     out.println " " ;    out.println " " ;         Turn on verbose output    OCCIConnection.setVerbose true ;       Get a cached connection    Connection connection = OCCIConnection.checkOut    ;         Statement  statement  = null;    ResultSet  resultSet  = null;    String     userName   = null;      try {         Test the connection     statement = connection.createStatement    ;     resultSet = statement.executeQuery       "select initcap user  from sys.dual" ;     if  resultSet.next           userName = resultSet.getString 1 ;    }    catch  SQLException e  {     out.println "DedicatedConnection.doGet     SQLException: " +        e.getMessage     + " " ;    }    finally {     if  resultSet != null        try { resultSet.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }      if  statement != null        try { statement.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }     }         Add a little delay to force       multiple connections in the connection cache    for  int o=0;o < 3;o++  {     for  int i=0;i < 2147483647;i++  {}    }         Return the conection    OCCIConnection.checkIn connection ;      out.println "Hello " + userName + "! " ;    out.println "You're using an Oracle Cached " +      "Connection Implementation connection! " ;    out.println " " ;    out.println " " ;   }     public void doPost     HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response       throws IOException, ServletException {    doGet request, response ;   }  }  Our second servlet, OCCIConnectionReportServlet, is shown in Example 7-7.  OCCIConnectionReportServlet displays the current status of the connection cache  implementations, queries the caching object OCCIConnection using its getReport     method, and displays the result of the report in your browser. Compile this servlet and place the  resulting class file in the directory with the OCCIConnection.class and  OCCIConnectionServlet.class files.    Example 7-7. A servlet that reports on the caching implementation   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class OCCIConnectionReportServlet extends HttpServlet {     public void doGet     HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws IOException, ServletException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter    ;    out.println " " ;    out.println " " ;    out.println " Oracle Cached Connection Implementation " +       "Report Servlet " ;    out.println " " ;    out.println " " ;    out.println " Oracle Cached Connection Implementations " ;     out.println " " ;    String[] lines = OCCIConnection.getReport    ;    if  lines != null && lines.length > 0  {     for  int i=0;i < lines.length;i++  {      out.println lines[i] ;     }    }    else     out.println "No caches implemented!" ;    out.println " " ;    out.println " " ;    out.println " " ;   }     public void doPost     HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response     throws IOException, ServletException {    doGet request, response ;   }  }    Now execute the report servlet first. You'll notice it reports no implementations of  OracleConnectionCacheImpl. Next, open a second browser window, execute the  OCCIConnectionServlet, and return to the report servlet and reload it. You should see one  connection in the "Database" implementation. Next, return to the test servlet window and click on  the Reload button quickly several times in a row. Once again, return to the report servlet window  and click on Reload. You'll see several connections in the cache, and perhaps several will still be  active.    This concludes Part II: our discussions of establishing a connection to a database. We'll touch  on connections one more time when we cover distributed transactions much later. But now it's  time to move on to the second part of the book, a discussion of JDBC's use with relational SQL.   Part III: Relational SQL   In Part III, we'll discuss the use of JDBC with relational SQL. Why the term  relational SQL? With Oracle, you have three options as to how you use the  database:       Use the database strictly as a relational database storing information in   tables.       Use tables to store your data and use object views and INSTEAD OF   triggers to provide an object-oriented presentation.       Create relational objects to store and present your information.   So which option is the right choice? That's a matter of argument we won't cover  in this book, but I will describe how to use JDBC with all three. To that end, this  part of this book covers option one, relational SQL.    Chapter 8. A Relational SQL Example  Before starting down the path on how to use JDBC with Data Definition Language  DDL  to create  database objects such as tables, sequences, and indexes, and on how to use Data Manipulation  Language  DML  to insert, update, delete, or select information from tables, let's take a chapter to  develop a hypothetical relational SQL example to use in the chapters that follow. In order to have  a context in which to work, we'll formulate a relational solution to part of a common business  problem, Human Resource  HR  management.    An HR management system is more than just a means of generating payroll and tax withholding.  Large organizations must also comply with safety and environmental regulations. Consequently,  their HR systems must keep track of the physical locations in which people perform their work,  along with the actual type of work they are performing. For management reasons, HR systems  also need to keep track of whom a person reports to and in which department of the organization  a person performs work. HR systems also need to track the legal status of their workers to know  whether they are employees or contractors. All this information changes. An HR system not only  needs to maintain this information for the current point in time, but also for any past point in time.    Since there are many books written on the subject of database analysis and design, I'd like to  emphasize here that I will not follow any particular methodology, nor will my analysis and design  be all that rigorous. Instead, I'm just going to walk you through my thinking process for this  example database. I considered using the Universal Modeling Language  UML  to document my  design, but the use of UML is still not widespread enough to address the whole audience of this  book. Instead, I use as common a terminology as possible.     8.1 Relational Database Analysis  Relational database analysis is a process whereby you identify and classify into groups the  information you need to store in a database. In addition, you identify the data items that can be  used to uniquely identify data that is grouped together, and you identify the relationships between  the different groups of information. An analysis commonly consists of the following major steps:    1.   2.   Identify the things for which you need to capture information.   Identify the data you need to capture for each thing.   3.  Determine the relationships between the different things you identified.    The common term for a "thing" in step 1 is "entity." An entity represents a class of a thing about  which you want to track information. The actual bits of data that you capture for each entity  step  2  are called attributes. The outcome of step 3 is a set of relations between entities.   8.1.1 Identifying Entities  If you paid close attention to my discussion of HR systems, you may have noticed that I  mentioned the following five entities:       A person     A location     A position or job     An organization     A status   When I take the time to consider that a particular person will most likely work in different  locations, perform different jobs, work for different organizations, and work as an employee or a  contractor at different times, I realize that I'll need to keep track of the times that person is  assigned to work at a location, perform a job, and so forth. That means I'll need four more entities  to act as intersections:       A history of the locations where the person has worked     A history of the jobs the person has performed      A history of the organizations for which the person has worked     A history of the person's employment status   Why do I call these intersections? Let's answer this question by examining the first intersection, a  person's history of locations. If I have a particular person's information stored in an entity called  PERSON, and all the possible locations where they could have worked are stored in an entity  called LOCATION, then I need to have a place to store a reference to both the person and a  location along with the time period when the person worked at that particular location. This place  ends up being an entity in its own right and is called an intersection because its attribute values  have meaning only in the context of the intersection of two other entities.   8.1.2 Identifying Primary Keys    So far, I've identified nine entities and alluded to the relationships between some of the entities.  My next step is to identify data about each entity that can uniquely identify an individual  occurrence of the entity. This is called the primary key. In addition, I'll also identify any other data,  or attributes as they are commonly called, that are needed. I'll start by figuring out how I can  uniquely identify a person. What do I know about people that would allow them to be uniquely  identified? They have:       A name     A birth date     Parents     A unique identification number such as a Social Security Number   I could probably use the combination of a person's name, birth date, and parents' names and  never run into a nonunique combination of those values. However, a nonunique combination of  those values is still possible. I could use a unique identifier, such as a Social Security Number   SSN , assigned by some authority, but what do I do if this is a global application? An SSN exists  only in the United States. In other countries they don't use an SSN. For example, in Canada a  person may have a Social Insurance Number  SIN , and in the United Kingdom, a person may  have a National Identifier  NI . Therefore, calling an attribute to be used as a primary key an SSN  will result in geographic limitations for my application.    Since none of the PERSON attributes I've described so far can guarantee a unique ID value, I'll  create a generic attribute called ID that can hold any kind of unique identifier  possibly an SSN   and a second attribute, ID TYPE, that can identify the type of identifier in the ID attribute. Thus, I  might identify a U.S. citizen as follows:   ID = 123-45-6789  ID TYPE = SSN  Now that I've identified the PERSON entity, its primary key, and other possible attributes, it's time  to represent it with some form of notation. The following notation, or something similar to it, is  commonly used to show an entity and its attributes:   PERSON   *ID   *ID_TYPE   LAST_NAME   FIRST_NAME   BIRTH_DATE   MOTHERS_MAIDEN_NAME   The first line is the entity name, which I've shown in bold. The remaining lines list the entity's  attributes. The asterisk before an attribute denotes that it is part of the entity's primary key.    The other entities in our HR system are LOCATION, POSITION, ORGANIZATION, and STATUS.  Over time, individual entries in these entities will go in and out of use. Accordingly, I'll give each  entity the following attributes:       A short description, or code     A long description, or name     A start and end date to keep track of when they come into and go out of use    I'll uniquely identify these entities by their code and start date. Both LOCATION and  ORGANIZATION can be hierarchical. That is, a high-level organization, such as a company, can    have several divisions that belong to it. In turn, each division can have several departments that  belong to it. So I'll also give these entities attributes to point to themselves as parents. Here, for  example, is the definition of the location entity:   LOCATION   *CODE   *START_DATE   PARENT_CODE   PARENT_START_DATE   NAME   END_DATE   And here is the definition of the person location intersection entity:  PERSON_LOCATION   *ID   *ID_TYPE   CODE   LOCATION_START_DATE   *START_DATE   END_DATE   The first two attributes in the PERSON_LOCATION entity, ID and ID_TYPE, represent the  primary key of the person table. The next two attributes, CODE and LOCATION_START_DATE,  represent the primary key of the location entity. These attributes are called foreign keys, because  they point to the primary key of other entities. The primary key of the PERSON_LOCATION entity  consists of the primary key from the person entity plus an additional START_DATE  see the fifth  column . It is not necessary to include the location entity's primary key in the primary key  definition for the intersection, because the person's ID and type, along with the start date of the  assignment, make each intersection entry unique. Also, not including the location's primary key  enforces a business rule, which prevents a person from being represented as working in more  than one place at a time.   8.1.3 Determining Relationships Between Entities  Although I've not talked about them directly, I`ve been thinking about the relationships between  the entities all along. It's hard not to. In the introductory paragraph, I stated that a person works at  a location, in a job, for an organization, and is either an employee or contractor. This statement  defined four relationships. When I thought more about it, I decided I needed four intersection  entities, one each between the PERSON entity and the other four entities: LOCATION,  POSITION, ORGANIZATION, and STATUS. This is because I will keep a history, not just the  current value, of each relationship. Each intersection entity actually represents two relationships,  for a total of eight. There are also the 2 hierarchical relationships, so at this point I'm aware of the  following 10 relationships:       PERSON to PERSON_LOCATION     LOCATION to PERSON_LOCATION     PERSON to PERSON_POSITION     POSITION to PERSON_POSITION     PERSON to PERSON_ORGANIZATION     ORGANIZATION to PERSON_ORGANIZATION     PERSON to PERSON_STATUS       STATUS to PERSON_STATUS     ORGANIZATION to ORGANIZATION     LOCATION to LOCATION   All that's left to consider is what is called cardinality. Cardinality refers to the number of  occurrences of any one entity that can point to occurrences of another, related, entity. For  example, zero or more persons can have zero or more person location assignments. And zero or  more locations can be assigned to zero or more person location assignments. Cardinality is  important because it refines primary key definitions and defines business rules.    In practice, you may end up determining relationships before you identify attributes and primary  keys, but analysis is an iterative process, so which comes first is not that important. What is  important is that you test your analysis against examples of real-world data so you can uncover  any flaws before you start creating any DDL.   8.2 Refining the Analysis  The use of real-world information in the primary key, as we just covered, is what I call a smart key  solution. A smart key is a key composed of real-world data values. This is how most entity- relationship analysis was done in the 1980s. We, the programming community at the time,  identified a set of entities that organized and described how information was used and how it  related to the real world. We used real-world data values as the primary keys for our tables. But  this technique of using real-world information to uniquely identify entries was flawed. As with all  things, analysts gained experience over time, and with hard-earned experience, learned a better  way to define an entity's primary key.   8.2.1 Defining Dumb Primary Keys  Here's what we learned. We discovered two flaws when using real-world information in a primary  key. First, over time, the users of the applications we built no longer wanted to uniquely identify  an entry by the real-world information that had been used. Second, they sometimes wanted to  rename the real-world values used in a primary key. Since real-world information was used in  primary keys, and therefore was referenced in foreign keys, it was not possible to change this  real-world information without a major migration of the data in the database. If we changed a  primary key in a row of one table, we had to change it in all the rows in related tables.  Sometimes, this also led to major modifications to our applications.    The solution to this problem was to use dumb primary keys. Dumb primary keys consist of just a  single numeric attribute. This attribute is assigned a unique value by the database whenever a  new entry is created for an entity. With Oracle, a type of schema element known as a sequence  can generate unique primary keys for primary entities such as PERSON and LOCATION. Dumb  primary keys are then used to establish the relationship between entities, while a unique index is  created against the former smart primary key attributes to create a unique key against real-world  information. In effect, I end up with both internal  dumb  and external  smart  primary keys.    Employing this technique of using dumb keys, reworking our person entity, and adding a dumb  key attribute called PERSON_ID, I get the following new definition for the person entity:   PERSON   *PERSON_ID   ID   ID_TYPE   LAST_NAME   FIRST_NAME   BIRTH_DATE     MOTHERS_MAIDEN_NAME   Now the person entity has one attribute that defines an entry's uniqueness. This attribute is  PERSON_ID, and it will be populated with a number generated by an Oracle sequence. For the  four other primary entities, I will also add a dumb primary key attribute. I'll name the attribute  using a combination of the entity's name and an _ID suffix. These dumb primary key attributes  will also hold an Oracle sequence number. For example, for the location entity, our definition  changes as follows:   LOCATION   *LOCATION_ID   PARENT_LOCATION_ID   CODE   START_DATE   NAME   END_DATE   And here is the person location intersection entity:  PERSON_LOCATION   *PERSON_ID   LOCATION_ID   *START_DATE   END_DATE   Not only does this new tactic allow us to change the descriptive external primary key at a latter  date without destroying relationships, it also simplifies the process of identifying the primary keys  and gets rid of the annoying problem of renaming colliding column names  such as location start  date in our previous person location intersection  in the intersection entities. Now the intersection  entities are more compact. This results in better performance by the SQL engine during joins.  However, experience once again has taught us that we can improve on this design.   8.2.2 Reanalysis of the Person Entity  In practice, a person may have several common identifiers used to identify him. For example, he  may have a badge number used for a security system, an employee ID used by the HR  department, a Social Security Number or Social Insurance Number, and perhaps a phone  number or email address. Clearly, it would be better if a system could handle multiple identifiers  rather than just one. To that end, I'll add a secondary, or child, entity named  PERSON_IDENTIFIER and relate it back to the PERSON entity. Here's the new entity's  definition:   PERSON_IDENTIFIER   *PERSON_ID   *ID   *ID_TYPE   Now that I have a separate entity to hold as many ID values as desired for a given person, I  modify the PERSON entity as follows:   PERSON   *PERSON_ID   LAST_NAME   FIRST_NAME   BIRTH_DATE   MOTHERS_MAIDEN_NAME   I've taken the ID and ID_TYPE attributes out of the PERSON entity and placed them in the new  entity named PERSON_IDENTIFIER. The PERSON_IDENTIFIER entity uses the PERSON_ID,  ID, and ID_TYPE attributes as its primary key. This means that the PERSON_IDENTIFIER can  hold an unlimited number of unique IDs for each person.     One last change is in order. To maintain data integrity, I'll add a codes entity, named  PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE, which will hold valid values for the PERSON_IDENTIFIER entity's  ID_TYPE attribute. Here's the definition for that entity:   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE   *ID_TYPE   INACTIVE_DATE   Figure 8-1 is an Entity Relationship Diagram  ERD  for my finished analysis. I'll use this as a  context as I cover JDBC in the following chapters. Now that we have the analysis completed, let's  move on to the design.    Figure 8-1. Entity relationship diagram for the sample HR database      8.3 Relational Database Design  At this point, we have a theoretical analysis of the HR database. Before we create a physical  implementation, we need to consider how it will be implemented. This is the step in which we  decide which data types we will use for the attributes, determine how to constrain those data  types, and define external primary keys, among other things. Let's start by deciding which data  types to use.   8.3.1 Selecting Data Types  One of the beautiful things about Oracle is that it does not have presentation data types. There is  no money type, for example. Not having presentation data types keeps things simple. The  number of data types you need to work with is kept to a bare minimum. With Oracle, you get a  small number of data types that allow you to work with the following four basic types of data:       Binary     Character       Date     Numeric   For binary data, you have the following Oracle data types to work with:   RAW    A varying-length binary type that can hold up to 2 KB   LONG RAW    BLOB    BFILE    A varying-length binary type that can hold up to 2 GB   A varying-length binary type that can hold up to 4 GB   An external file that can hold up to 4 GB   For character data, you have the following types at your disposal:  CHAR  or NCHAR     A fixed-length character type right-padded with space characters up to its constraining  size    VARCHAR2  or NVARCHAR2     A varying-length character type that can hold as many characters as will fit within its  constraining size    LONG    CLOB    A varying-length character type that can hold up to 2 GB   A varying-length character type that can hold up to 4 GB    When dealing with character data, it's a good idea not to use CHAR, because the side effects of  its fixed length require you to right-pad VARCHAR2 data values in order to do comparisons.  LONG and CLOB are very specialized and are needed only in rare occasions. That leaves us  with VARCHAR2 as the character data type of choice.    The other two types of data you will work with are dates and numbers. For date values, you have  the data type DATE. For numeric data, you have the NUMBER type with up to 38 digits of  precision.    A VARCHAR2 data type must be constrained with a maximum size, while NUMBER can be  constrained or unconstrained as desired. If you are going to use a multi-byte character set in the  database, then you need to make the VARCHAR2 or NVARCHAR2 columns larger to hold the  same amount of data. On that thought, I suggest you be liberal in the amount of storage you give  your VARCHAR2 data types.    When it comes to constraining the size of numbers, I don't. Why should I specify a maximum size  when I don't have to? It seems to me that constraining numbers is an old habit from a time when  it was necessary to do so for storage management. Since Oracle uses only the number of bytes  required to represent something to store it, i.e., varying-length storage, there is no point in  constraining numbers, which builds in obsolescence.    So all this discussion has led up to using three data types:      DATE       NUMBER     VARCHAR2    Things couldn't get much simpler. Before I write the actual DDL statements to create tables for  the HR application, let's talk about DDL coding conventions.   8.3.2 DDL Coding Conventions  Whether you call them conventions or standards, when everyone on a development team plays  by the same rules, it's more efficient and just plain easier. I say conventions rather than  standards, because I never found a standard I didn't need to break occasionally in order for  things to make sense. Here are my suggested conventions for writing DDL:    1.  Make table names singular. For example: PERSON, not PERSONS.   2.  Make a primary entity's primary key a sequence-generated number named using the   table's name suffixed with _ID. For example: PERSON_ID.    3.  Create a sequence for each primary entity's table using the table's name suffixed with   _ID. For example: PERSON_ID.    4.  Create an index for each primary entity's table using the table's name suffixed with _PK.   For example: PERSON_PK.    5.  Create any required unique indexes for external primary keys using the table's name   suffixed with _UK. For example, PERSON_UK1.    6.  Do not use a parent table's primary key constraint  PKC  as part of the definition for a   child table's PKC.    7.  Use one of the following two methods to create the PKCs for code tables. First, use the  code value as the PKC of the code table. Second, create a dumb key just as you do for  primary entities. These two methods are equally valid and fraught with complications.  Using code values makes decision support queries easier to write but introduces the  problem of lost relationships that the primary entities suffered from in our first analysis.    8.  Always create foreign key constraints, even if you must leave them disabled because   they are conditional. This helps to document your database. You can always implement a  conditional constraint with a database trigger.    If you use these conventions, it will be easy for you to identify the PKCs and unique keys for a  given table, transfer system knowledge to other team members, and simplify your documentation  process.   8.3.3 Writing the DDL  Now that we have an application context to work from, and some DDL coding conventions to  work with, it's time to write some DDL for our HR database. Writing the code for the DDL is a  process by which we take our logical model -- the entities, attributes, internal and external primary  keys, and relationships -- and transform them into SQL code to create the physical  implementation: tables, columns, PKCs and unique indexes, and foreign key constraints.    We'll start with the PERSON entity. First, here's the table definition:   create table PERSON    person_id            number        not null,  last_name            varchar2 30   not null,    first_name           varchar2 30   not null,  middle_name          varchar2 30 ,  birth_date           date          not null,  mothers_maiden_name  varchar2 30   not null    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0   Next, here's the PKC:  alter  table PERSON add   constraint   PERSON_PK  primary key   person_id    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10 K next 10 K pctincrease 0   Here's our external unique constraint:  create unique index PERSON_UK1  on                  PERSON    last_name,  first_name,  birth_date,  mothers_maiden_name    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0   And finally, here's our sequence:  create sequence PERSON_ID  start with 1  order  That takes care of PERSON. Now let's do the same for LOCATION:  create table LOCATION    location_id         number  not null,  parent_location_id  number,  code                varchar2 30   not null,  name                varchar2 80   not null,  start_date          date          not null,  end_date            date    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0     alter  table LOCATION add  constraint   LOCATION_PK  primary key   location_id    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10 K next 10 K pctincrease 0     create unique index LOCATION_UK1  on                  LOCATION    code,  start_date,  parent_location_id    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0     create sequence LOCATION_ID    start with 1  order  Here's the PERSON_LOCATION intersection:  create table PERSON_LOCATION    person_id     number  not null,  location_id   number  not null,  start_date    date    not null,  end_date      date    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0     alter  table PERSON_LOCATION add  constraint   PERSON_LOCATION_PK  primary key   person_id, start_date    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10 K next 10 K pctincrease 0   and the PERSON_IDENTIFIER entity:  create table PERSON_IDENTIFIER    person_id   number        not null,  id          varchar2 30   not null,  id_type     varchar2 30   not null    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0     alter  table PERSON_IDENTIFIER add  constraint   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_PK  primary key   person_id, id, id_type    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0   and finally, the PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE entity:  create table PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE    code           varchar2 30   not null,  description    varchar2 80   not null,  inactive_date  date    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0     alter  table PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE add  constraint   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_PK  primary key   code    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0   Now that we have some of our needed table definitions, let's create the DDL for foreign key  constraints. The person table has no foreign key constraints, so we'll start with the LOCATION  table:   alter  table LOCATION add  constraint   LOCATION_FK1  foreign key             parent_location_id    references   LOCATION   location_id    Next, we have PERSON_LOCATION:    alter  table PERSON_LOCATION add  constraint   PERSON_LOCATION_FK1   foreign key           person_id    references   PERSON   person_id      alter  table PERSON_LOCATION add  constraint   PERSON_LOCATION_FK2   foreign key             location_id    references   LOCATION   location_id    and then PERSON_IDENTIFIER:  alter  table PERSON_IDENTIFIER add  constraint   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_FK1   foreign key           person_id    references   PERSON   person_id      alter  table PERSON_LOCATION add  constraint   PERSON_LOCATION_FK2  foreign key                           id_type    references   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE   code    Now that we have our DDL, we can move on to the next step in our process, which is to actually  create the database objects. Normally, you'd use Oracle's SQL*Plus to accomplish this task.  However, since this is a book about JDBC, I'll show you how to use JDBC to execute the DDL  instead. In Chapter 9, we'll cover the execution of DDL and DML. Among other things, you'll see  how to execute the DDL to create the HR tables.   Chapter 9. Statements  Now that you have a firm understanding of how to create a Connection object for each of the  four types of clients outlined in Introduction to JDBC, and you have the DDL to create the  example HR database to use as a context for the chapters on relational SQL, we're ready to  change our focus from the Connection object to the Statement object. The Statement  object, which you'll create using a Connection object, allows you to execute both Data  Definition Language  DDL  and Data Manipulation Language  DML  statements. The Statement  object is the most dynamic of the JDBC objects, because you can use its execute    method to  execute any valid SQL statement. If you use the execute    method, you can use its return  value at runtime to determine whether there is a result set and then use the Statement object's  getResultSet    method to retrieve the result set, or you can use the Statement object's  getUpdateCount    method at runtime to determine the number of rows affected by your  statement. For most situations, however, you won't need that much flexibility. Instead, you'll need  to insert rows into a table, update or delete rows in a table, or select rows from a table. To that  end, you'll most often use one of the Statement object's other two execute methods,  executeUpdate    and executeQuery   .    In this chapter, we'll start by covering how to create a Statement object from a Connection  object. Then we'll see how to use the execute    method to execute the DDL from Chapter 8.  We'll continue by using the executeUpdate    method to insert rows into our new tables.  Finally, we'll use the executeQuery    method to query data in the database.   9.1 Creating a Statement Object  Before you can use a Statement object to execute a SQL statement, you need to create one  using the Connection object's createStatement    method, as in the following example:     Statement stmt = null;  try {    stmt = conn.createStatement        . . .   }  catch  SQLException e  {    . . .  }  finally {    . . .  }    In this example, we assume that a Connection object named conn already exists. In a try  block, call the Connection object's createStatement    method to create a new  Statement object. If an error occurs during the call, a SQLException is thrown.    Once you've created a Statement object, you can then use it to execute a SQL statement with  one of its three execute methods. Select the execute method that best suits your needs:   boolean execute String SQL     Returns a boolean value of true if a ResultSet object can be retrieved; otherwise, it  returns false. Use this method to execute SQL DDL statements or when you need to  use truly dynamic SQL.   int executeUpdate String SQL     Returns the numbers of rows affected by the execution of the SQL statement. Use this  method to execute SQL statements for which you expect to get a number of rows  affected -- for example, an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.    ResultSet executeQuery String SQL     Returns a ResultSet object. Use this method when you expect to get a result set, as  you would with a SELECT statement.    In the sections that follow, we'll examine the use of these three methods in detail. So let's start  with the execute    method.   9.2 The execute    Method  The execute    method is the most generic method you can use to execute a SQL statement  in JDBC. To execute a SQL statement with the execute method, call it by passing it a valid SQL  statement as a String object, or as a string literal, as shown in the following example:   boolean isResultSet = false;  Statement stmt = null;  try {    stmt = conn.createStatement    ;    isResultSet = stmt.execute "select 'Hello 'USER from dual" ;      . . .   }    In this example, we assume that Connection object conn already exists. First, a boolean  variable named isResultSet is created to hold the return value from the call to the execute     method. Next, a variable named stmt is created to hold a reference to the Statement object.  In the try block, the Statement object is created with a call to the Connection object's  createStatement    method. Then, the Statement object's execute    method is called  passing a SQL SELECT statement. Since this is a SELECT statement, the execute    method  returns a boolean true to indicate that a result set is available. You can then call the Statement    object's getResultSet    method to retrieve the ResultSet object that contains the data  from the database. For example:   boolean isResultSet = false;  Statement stmt = null;  ResultSet rslt = null;  try {    stmt = conn.createStatement    ;    isResultSet = stmt.execute "select 'Hello 'USER from dual" ;      if  isResultSet  {      rslt = stmt.getResultSet    ;    }    . . .   }    We'll cover result sets in great detail in Chapter 10.    If an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE SQL statement is passed to execute   , the method will  return a boolean false, indicating that no result set is available. In that case, call the  Statement object's getUpdateCount    method to retrieve the number of rows that were  affected by the SQL statement. For example:   boolean isResultSet = false;  int rslt = null;  Statement stmt = null;  try {   stmt = conn.createStatement    ;   isResultSet = stmt.execute "delete person" ;    if  !isResultSet  {   rslt = stmt.getUpdateCount    ;    }    . . .   }    If a DDL statement had been passed to the execute    method, it too would have returned  false. However, since no result set was created, nor were any rows affected by DDL, there is  nothing more to do after the execute    method is called.    If an error occurs during a call to the execute    method, a SQLException is thrown. This  means that each call to a method from the Statement object requires you to use a try block or  declare that the method from which you are calling a Statement object's method throws a  SQLException.    Now that you have the necessary background to use the Statement object's execute     method, let's use it to execute the DDL we created in Chapter 8.   9.2.1 Executing DDL   In Chapter 8, we documented the DDL statements required to create the objects for our HR  database. We will now execute those statements via JDBC. To do this, we need to choose an  appropriate execute method. A DDL statement to create a database object does not affect any  rows, nor does it return a result set. Consequently, the execute    method is the best  candidate for executing our DDL.    Example 9-1 shows a sample program that reads and executes SQL statements contained in a  text file. Specify the name of the SQL command file on the command line when you run the  program. The program allows each SQL statement in the file to span one or more lines and    expects each SQL statement to be terminated with a forward slash character     on a separate  line following the statement.    Example 9-1. An application that executes DDL statements from a file   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;    public class ExecuteDDL {    Connection conn;    public ExecuteDDL     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      if  args.length < 1  {        System.err.println "Usage: java ExecuteDDL  " ;         System.exit 1 ;      }      new ExecuteDDL    .process args[0] ;    }      public void process String fileName  throws IOException, SQLException  {      boolean        rslt = false;      BufferedReader in   = new BufferedReader new FileReader fileName  ;       Statement      stmt = null;      StringBuffer   sql  = new StringBuffer 1024 ;      String         line = null;        while   line = in.readLine      != null  {         System.out.println line ;        if  line.length     == 1 && line.indexOf " "  >  -1  {          try {            stmt = conn.createStatement    ;            rslt = stmt.execute sql.toString     ;            System.out.println "OK" ;            System.out.println " " ;          }          catch  SQLException e  {            System.err.println e.getMessage     ;          }          finally {            if  stmt != null                try { stmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }           }          sql = new StringBuffer 1024 ;          }        else {          sql.append line ;          sql.append " " ;        }      }       System.out.println sql ;      in.close    ;    }      protected void finalize          throws Throwable {      if  conn != null          try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       super.finalize    ;    }  }   Our DDL execution program is named ExecuteDDL. In its main    method, it first verifies that a  parameter has been passed on the command line. Then it creates an anonymous instance of  itself and executes that instance's process method. The filename parameter is passed to the  process    method, which then parses and executes the DDL contained in the specified file. A  database connection is made when the ExecuteDDL    object instantiates itself. Its default  constructor, ExecuteDDL   , loads the Oracle driver and then connects to the database using  the DriverManager.getConnection    method.    The process    method begins by allocating five variables:   rslt    A boolean to receive the return value from the execute    method    A BufferedReader object used to read the contents of a SQL command file    A Statement object to execute the DDL    A StringBuffer object used to hold a SQL statement read from the SQL command file    A String to hold the results of the BufferedReader.readLine    method    The process    method continues by entering a while loop in which lines are read from the  specified SQL command file until the end of the file has been reached. Inside the while loop, the  method performs the following steps:    1.  The current SQL statement is echoed to the screen.   2.  An if statement tests to see if the line has a length of 1 and contains a forward-slash       character. If these conditions are met, the current statement in the buffer is executed.    3.   If the conditions in step 2 are not met, the current input line is appended to the  StringBuffer object named sql.    in    stmt    sql    line     If step 2 indicates that a complete SQL statement has been read into the buffer, the if statement  will execute a try block. Inside the try block, the following steps are taken to execute the SQL  statement contained in the buffer:    1.  A Statement object is created using the Connection object's createStatement      method.    2.  The SQL statement is executed using the Statement object's execute    method.   The current contents of the StringBuffer object named sql are passed as a String  parameter to that method.    3.  To give the user of the program a warm fuzzy feeling that everything is working as   expected, the word "OK" followed by a blank line is displayed.    If an error occurs inside the try block, execution branches immediately to the catch clause  following the try block. There, the code prints the current error message to the screen. Upon  completion of the try block, regardless of whether an exception occurs, the finally clause  closes the Statement object if it exists  an error could occur prior to the instantiation of the  Statement object . The sql buffer is then reinitialized to hold another SQL statement.    When there are no more SQL statement lines to read, the while loop ends. Any partial,  unexecuted SQL statement still in the buffer is displayed, and the BufferedReader object is  then closed. The program terminates after calling the finalize    method, which closes the  database connection.    There are some very important points to note about the code in Example 9-1. First, in the  process    method, the Statement variable stmt is declared outside the try block. This is  done so that the stmt variable is accessible in the finally clause. Had it been declared inside  the try block, it would be out of the scope of the catch and finally clauses. Second, the  finally clause guarantees that any open Statement object is closed regardless of whether  the statement executed correctly or failed and threw an exception.       With Oracle's JDBC implementation, you must always  explicitly close a Statement object; otherwise, you will leak  memory and lose database cursors.       9.2.2 Creating the HR Tables   You can use the program in Example 9-1 to create the tables for the HR example schema used  in this book. Begin by entering the commands to create the HR database tables from Chapter 8  into separate text files. Then, if you have any errors in your SQL, it won't be so hard to correct  them. Use one file per table and place a CREATE TABLE statement with all related ALTER  TABLE, CREATE INDEX, and CREATE SEQUENCE statements into each file. End each  command with a forward- slash character     on a separate line. Then compile the program in  Example 9-1 and execute it for each file using the following syntax:   java ExecuteDDL filename  If you have any syntax errors in your command files, you will get a fairly informative SQL  diagnostic message from the database. Make any necessary corrections and re-execute the files.  Continue that process until you have no SQL creation errors. I say creation errors, because you  may encounter "object already exists" errors when you reexecute your SQL after making  corrections. You can safely ignore any "object already exists" errors.     9.3 The executeUpdate    Method  Now that we've created some tables using the execute    method, we can continue by using  the executeUpdate    method to insert, update, and delete rows in those tables. The  executeUpdate    method works just like the execute    method, except that it returns an  integer value that reports the number of rows affected by the SQL statement. The  executeUpdate    method effectively combines the execute    and getUpdateCount     methods into one call:   int       rslt = 0;  Statement stmt = null;  try {    stmt = conn.createStatement    ;    rslt = stmt.executeUpdate "delete person" ;     . . .   }    In this example, we once again assume that a Connection object named conn already exists.  The example starts by declaring the int variable rslt to hold the number of rows affected by  the SQL statement. Next, it declares a Statement variable, stmt, to hold the reference to a  Statement object. In the try block, the Statement object is created using the Connection  object's createdStatement    method, and a reference to it is stored in stmt. Then, the  Statement object's executeUpdate    method is called to execute the SQL DELETE  statement, returning the number of rows affected into rslt. Now that you have the general idea,  let's see the executeUpdate    method in action.   9.3.1 Executing an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE Statement   Example 9-2, shows an insert , update, and delete program which uses the executeUpdate     method.   Example 9-2. An application to execute, insert, update, or delete DML   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;    public class ExecuteIUD {    Connection conn;    public ExecuteIUD     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {       System.err.println e.getMessage     ;       e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      ExecuteIUD iud = new ExecuteIUD    ;        iud.executeIUD        "insert into PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE " +          " code, description, inactive_date  " +        "values  'EID', 'Employee ID', NULL " ;        iud.executeIUD        "insert into PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE " +        " code, description, inactive_date  " +        "values  'PHONE', 'Phone Number', NULL " ;        iud.executeIUD        "insert into PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE " +        " code, description, inactive_date  " +        "values  'SSN', 'Social Socurity Number', NULL " ;         iud.executeIUD        "update PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE " +        "set description = 'Social Security Number' " +        "where code = 'SSN'" ;        iud.executeIUD        "delete PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE " +        "where  code = 'PHONE'" ;    }      public void executeIUD String sql  throws IOException, SQLException {       int       rslt = 0;      Statement stmt = null;        System.out.println sql ;      try {        stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeUpdate sql ;        System.out.println Integer.toString rslt  + " rows affected" ;         System.out.println " " ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;      }      finally {        if  stmt != null           try { stmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       }    }      protected void finalize          throws Throwable {      if  conn != null          try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       super.finalize    ;    }  }  Our insert, update, and delete program, ExecuteIUD, starts out in its main    method by  instantiating a copy of itself. Then it calls the executeIUD    method three times to insert three  identifier type codes into the PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE table. These inserts are followed by  an UPDATE statement to change the description for type code SSN. Finally, a DELETE  statement is executed to delete the phone type code.     The executeIUD    method begins by creating two variables. One is an int named rslt that  holds the return value from the executeUpdate    method. The other is a Statement object  named stmt that is used to execute the SQL statements. The method continues by echoing the  passed SQL statement to the screen. It then executes the try block, in which the SQL statement  is executed.    Inside the try block, the program creates a Statement object and then proceeds to execute the  passed SQL statement by using the Statement object's executeUpdate    method. The  executeUpdate    method returns the number of rows affected by the statement, and the  program displays that number followed by a blank line on the screen.    If an error occurs in the try block, program execution immediately branches to the  SQLException catch clause where the Oracle SQL diagnostic error message is sent to the  screen. Upon completion of the try block, the finally clause closes the Statement object if it  is open.    The only notable difference between this example and the last, as if you haven't already heard  this enough times already, is that the executeUpdate    method returns an integer value that  reports the number of rows affected by the SQL statement just executed.   9.3.2 Auto-Commit  When you use executeUpdate    to perform your inserts, updates, and deletes, be aware that  auto-commit is on by default. This means that as each SQL statement is executed, it is also  committed. Effectively, each statement execution becomes its own transaction. If you are  executing multiple statements, it is not efficient to commit after each one. In addition, if you are  performing complex insertion processes such as those involving both parent and child tables, you  probably don't want your parent rows to be inserted without the corresponding child rows also  being inserted. So for reasons of both performance and transaction integrity, you may want or  need to turn off auto-commit. You can do that using the Connection object's setAutoCommit     method, passing it a boolean false:   conn.setAutoCommit false ;  Once you've turned off auto-commit, you can execute any number of executeUpdate    calls,  which will all form one transaction. Then, when you are done making all your executeUpdate     calls, you'll need to call the Connection object's commit    method to make your changes  permanent.   9.3.3 Oracle and SQL92 Escape Syntax  Another issue to be concerned about when using Statement.executeUpdate    is that it  requires you to perform rather complex string concatenations. Because executeUpdate     requires a String object as an input parameter, you have to convert any values stored in other  data types that are required to build your SQL statements into String objects before  concatenating them to build your SQL statement. To accomplish this task, you must write your  own helper functions and use either Oracle's built-in database functions or SQL92's escape  syntax.    As you convert values in other data types to Strings and concatenate them into a larger  String object to represent a SQL statement, you must consider the following issues:       You must escape any use of the single quote, or tick character.      You must convert numeric data types to strings.       You must convert date and time data types to strings and then wrap them with an   appropriate database function to convert the string representation of the date or time  values to the database's date type.    The next few sections talk about these and other issues in detail. Keep in mind that in Chapter  11, we'll cover an alternative to the Statement object, a PreparedStatement object that  eliminates the need for handling these issues.    9.3.3.1 Handling ticks   You must replace any occurrences of a tick character  '  within your SQL statement with double  ticks  '' , so they can be parsed correctly by the database. The double tick is Oracle's escape  syntax for the tick character. For example, consider a SQL statement such as the following, in  which a value contains a tick character:   delete person where last_name = 'O'Reilly'  Before trying to execute this statement, you must replace the tick character in O'Reilly with a  double-tick character:   delete person where last_name = 'O''Reilly'   Tick characters are also referred to as single-quote  characters.          9.3.3.2 Converting numbers   You must convert any numeric data types to strings using an appropriate wrapper object's  toString    method. If your numbers are stored in Java primitive data types such as long or  double, then you must call the primitive wrapper class's static toString    method. Table 9- 1 lists the different toString    methods available for primitive data types.    Table 9-1. Primitive data type to string conversion methods    Primitive data type   Wrapper class method to call   short s   int I   long l   float f   double d   Short.toString short s    Integer.toString int I    Long.toString long l    Float.toString float f    Double.toString double d    If your numeric data is already stored in a wrapper, or in some other numeric class, you can  simply call that class's toString    method to convert your numeric value to a String.   9.3.3.3 Converting date and time values   You must convert any date, time, or timestamp data type values to strings using an appropriate  java.text.DateFormat object. For example, you can use a  java.text.SimpleDateFormat object. The SimpleDateFormat class allows you to pass in  a date format mask when you instantiate an object of the class. Then, you can use the newly    instantiated SimpleDateFormat object to convert a Date, Time, or Timestamp object into a  String by calling its format    method, as shown in the following example:   SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss" ;  String dateString = sdf.format date ;  You can find the complete date format syntax to use with SimpleDateFormat in the JDK API  documentation for the SimpleDateFormat class.    After you convert a Java Date, Time, or Timestamp to a String, you're still not finished. Next,  you must wrap the string value with the Oracle TO_DATE    database function or use the SQL92  escape syntax to convert your string representation into an Oracle DATE value, which is what the  database expects. The SQL92 escape syntax provides you with a portable means of specifying a  date, time, or timestamp. The escape syntax string is translated into native Oracle syntax on the  fly by the JDBC driver.    9.3.3.4 Using Oracle's built-in TO_DATE    function   Oracle's TO_DATE    function has the following syntax:   TO_DATE  varchar2, 'format'    in which format can be any combination of format specifiers found in Table 9-2.    Table 9-2. Oracle TO_DATE    format specifiers    Format   Description   yyyy    mm    dd    mi    ss    hh24    Four-digit year   Two-digit month   Two-digit day   24 clock, two-digit hour   Two-digit minutes   Two-digit seconds   Many more possibilities for format specifiers can be found in the Oracle SQL Reference manual.  For example, to convert the string value 19800101000000, which happens to be the character  representation of the timestamp for midnight on January 1, 1980, to an Oracle DATE value, code  the following in a SQL statement:   TO_CHAR  '19800101000000', 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS'    9.3.3.5 Using SQL92 syntax with dates   Oracle supports the following three SQL92 escape syntaxes for use with date, time, and  timestamp values:   {d 'yyyy-mm-dd'}   For a date   {t 'hh:mm:ss'}    For a time   {ts 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss'}     For a timestamp   To use one of these escape syntaxes, replace the format with a value that is appropriately  formatted for that mask. For example, to use the ts, or timestamp mask, you must convert a  Java Date value to a String using the yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss format. If the date is January  1, 1980, then you must convert the Java Date object to a String object that looks like the  following:   1980-01-01 00:00:00  Then, you must wrap the converted timestamp value with the SQL92 escape syntax. The result  looks like this:   {ts '1980-01-01 00:00:00'}  You then use this character representation of the date in your SQL statement:   update location set end_date = {ts '1980-01-01 00:00:00'}   9.3.3.6 An escape syntax example   Example 9-3 demonstrates the replacement of single ticks with double ticks. It also  demonstrates the use of both the Oracle TO_DATE    database function and SQL92's escape  syntax.    Example 9-3. An application that demonstrates SQL statement formulation   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.text.*;    public class ConcatenatingStringsForIUD {    Connection conn;    public ConcatenatingStringsForIUD     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver       ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {       System.err.println e.getMessage     ;       e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      ConcatenatingStringsForIUD iud = new ConcatenatingStringsForIUD    ;         String last_name           = "O'Reilly";      String first_name          = "Tim";      String middle_name         = null;      Date   birth_date          = Date.valueOf "1971-03-17" ;      String mothers_maiden_name = "Oh!

In the main    method, it creates several strings for concatenating values in  a SQL statement. The program also creates one Date variable, the value of which will later be  converted to a String in order to build the program's SQL statements. The variable last_name  contains a last name that uses a tick character. If it is not modified to use the Oracle escape  syntax of two ticks, the SQL statement will fail. To solve this problem, I've created a helper  function, formatWithTicks   , which replaces any occurrence of one tick with two ticks. The  function also surrounds the string value with ticks, which is the necessary format for a string value  in a SQL statement.    The variable birth_date contains a Date value. This needs to be converted to a String value  in order to build our SQL statements. To that end, I've created two helper functions,  formatWithOracleDate    and formatWithSql92Date   , which convert Date values  into properly formatted String values for use in a SQL statement.    You should compile and run the program shown in Example 9-3, because running the program  will do more to clarify what it does than just looking at the code. When you run it, the program    displays each newly formatted SQL statement on the screen right before the statement is  executed. It'll be easy to see the effects of the helper functions.   9.3.4 More on SQL92 Escape Syntax  It would be wonderful if Oracle had complete support for SQL92 escape syntax, but it doesn't. In  this section, we'll take the time to look at other forms of SQL92 escape syntax that Oracle does  support and highlight the more useful forms it does not support. We'll finish up with a sample  program you can use to test your SQL92 escape syntax.    9.3.4.1 SQL92 LIKE escape syntax   There is a seldom used SQL92 escape syntax for the LIKE keyword in a WHERE clause. The  LIKE keyword allows you to find strings that match a given pattern. It recognizes the percent  %   and underscore characters  _  as pattern match operators. If you want to actually search for  pattern match characters in a string, you need a way to distinguish between when to use them as  pattern match characters and when to use them as regular characters. You do this using an  escape character, which is defined with the following syntax:   {ESCAPE 'escape character'}  If you wish to find all the tables you have access to that have an underscore character as a  middle character, then you might try a query such as:   select table_name   from   all_tables   where  table_name like '%_%'  But this query doesn't work as you suspect. Instead, you get all the tables you have access to,  not just the ones with an underscore in the middle. In order for the underscore character to be  interpreted as a character to search for, not a pattern match operator, you have to escape it:   select table_name   from   all_tables   where  table_name like '% _%' {escape ' '}  Note the use of the escape character before the underscore.   If you use the backslash character  \  as the escape character, you also have to use two  backslash characters in your Java String literal, because the backslash is also a Java escape  character. For example:   select table_name   from   all_tables   where  table_name like '%\\_%' {escape '\\'}  When using the ESCAPE keyword, you don't need to escape all the pattern match characters in  your search string. You only need to escape those that you aren't using as pattern match  characters.    9.3.4.2 Outer join escape syntax   As of Version 8.1.6, Oracle does not support the SQL92 escape syntax for outer joins. For outer  joins you have to use the Oracle  +  syntax.   9.3.4.3 Function escape syntax   Oracle does not support the SQL92 escape syntax for functions. Nor does Oracle support all the  scalar database functions. You can use the following four Connection methods to ascertain  which scalar functions the driver supports:   DatabaseMetaData.getNumericFunctions        DatabaseMetaData.getStringFunctions      DatabaseMetaData.getSystemFunctions      DatabaseMetaData.getTimeDateFunctions      9.3.4.4 Unsupported SQL92 syntax   If you use any unsupported SQL92 escape syntax, you will get the following error message in the  subsequent SQLException: "Non supported SQL92 token at position xx."    You can test your SQL92 escape syntax by preparsing the SQL statement using the  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleSql.parse    method. Example 9-4 takes a SQL92 string  at the prompt and converts it into Oracle syntax using the OracleSql.parse    method.   Example 9-4. An application that Preparses SQL92 syntax   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;    public class TestSQL92Syntax {      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception {      new TestSQL92Syntax  .process    ;    }      private void process     {      BufferedReader in   = null;      String         line = null;      try {        in = new BufferedReader new InputStreamReader  System.in  ;        System.out.println " " ;        System.out.print "SQL92> " ;        while  ! line = in.readLine     .equals ""   {           System.out.println "line = \"" + line + "\"" ;          try {            System.out.println              new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleSql    .parse line  ;          }          catch  SQLException e  {            System.out.println e.getMessage     ;          }          finally {            System.out.println " " ;            System.out.print "SQL92> " ;          }        }      }      catch  IOException e  {        System.out.println e.getMessage     ;      }      finally {        if  in != null            try { in.close    ; } catch  IOException ignore  { }       }    }  }    If you execute the program by typing java TestSQL92Syntax, you'll get a SQL92 prompt. You  can then type your SQL92 escape syntax after the prompt and press Enter to see how it is  converted to Oracle syntax. For example, here we test {d '1900-01-01'}:   SQL92> {d '1900-01-01'}  line = "{d '1900-01-01'}"  TO_DATE  '1900-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'   SQL92>  If we try a SQL statement with a SQL92 outer join, we get a "Non supported SQL92 token ..."  error.   9.3.5 Batching  Batching allows you to group related SQL statements into a batch. When you send several SQL  statements to the database at once, you reduce the amount of protocol dialog overhead, thereby  improving performance.    Oracle's JDBC driver does not actually implement batching for the Statement object. You can  use the addBatch    and executeBatch    methods, but each statement is executed on  each call to addBatch   . Therefore, you will see no performance improvement with the use of  Statement batching. You must use a PreparedStatement object to use batching. We'll  discuss batching in detail in Chapter 11.   9.4 The executeQuery    Method  Now that you've learned how to insert, update, and delete data in a table, it's time to learn how to  use a SELECT statement to retrieve data. Whereas the execute    and executeUpdate     methods discussed in previous sections return primitive data types -- a boolean and int,  respectively -- the method normally used with a SELECT statement, executeQuery   , returns  a ResultSet object. The executeQuery    method effectively combines the execute     and getResultSet    methods into one call:   ResultSet rset = null;  Statement stmt = null;  try {    stmt = conn.createStatement    ;    rset = stmt.executeQuery "select last_name, first_name from person" ;      . . .   }    In this example, we once again assume that a Connection object, conn, already exists. The  example starts out by declaring a ResultSet variable, rset, to hold the reference to the  ResultSet object generated by the SQL statement. Next, it declares a Statement variable,  stmt, to hold the reference to a Statement object. In the try block, the Statement object is  created and stored in stmt using the Connection object's createdStatement    method.  Then, the Statement object's executeQuery    method is called to execute the SQL  SELECT statement, returning a ResultSet into rset.    A ResultSet  which we will cover in great detail in Chapter 10  is an object that has a set of  accessor methods that allow you to get to the data returned from the database. These include  methods for positioning the cursor, doing in-place updates, and performing a variety of other  functions.   9.4.1 Executing a SELECT Statement    To create a result set, we begin by creating a SQL SELECT statement in a fashion similar to how  we created INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. We then call the executeQuery     method to execute the statement and get a ResultSet object. Take a look at the program in  Example 9-5, which issues a SELECT statement to query the PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE  table.    Example 9-5. An application that demonstrates executeQuery      import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.text.*;    public class ExecuteSelect {    Connection conn;      public ExecuteSelect     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott ", "tiger" ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      ExecuteSelect s = new ExecuteSelect    ;          s.executeSelect        "select code, description, inactive_date " +        "from   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE " +        "order by code" ;    }      public void executeSelect String sql       throws IOException, SQLException {      Date       inactive_date = null;      DateFormat df            =       DateFormat.getDateInstance DateFormat.SHORT ;      int        rows          = 0;      ResultSet  rslt          = null;      Statement  stmt          = null;        System.out.println sql ;      try {        stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery sql ;        while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          System.out.print rslt.getString "code"  + "  " ;           System.out.print rslt.getString "description"  + "  " ;           inactive_date = rslt.getDate "inactive_date" ;          if  inactive_date != null                System.out.println df.format inactive_date  ;           else            System.out.println "NULL" ;        }        System.out.println Integer.toString rows  + " rows selected" ;         System.out.println " " ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;      }      finally {        if  rslt != null            try { rslt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  stmt != null            try { stmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }      }    }     protected void finalize         throws Throwable {     if  conn != null         try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }      super.finalize    ;    }  }  In main   , the program instantiates a copy of itself. The main    method then calls the  executeSelect    method, passing the SQL SELECT statement that will be executed as a  parameter. In the executeSelect    method, the program starts by creating five variables:   inactive_date    A Date to hold the inactive date from the database for each row as the while loop moves  through cursor values    df    rows    rslt    stmt    A DateFormat used to convert the inactive date into a formatted String    An int used to count the number of rows selected from the database    A ResultSet to hold the return value from the executeQuery    method    A Statement used to execute the SELECT statement   After the program creates its local variables, it continues by echoing the SQL statement to the  screen and then enters a try block.    In the try block, the program first creates a Statement object by calling the Connection  object's createStatement    method. Next, the program executes the SELECT statement  using the Statement object's executeQuery    method. This method returns a ResultSet  object that contains all the rows and columns from the database that satisfy the query. The  program proceeds by entering a while loop in which the ResultSet is tested for more results.  The program determines if there are more rows by calling the ResultSet object's next     method. If there are more results, the row count is incremented and the String values of the  columns are displayed on the screen.     If an SQLException occurs during the execution of the statements in the try block, the  program immediately branches to the catch clause where the Oracle diagnostic error message  is displayed on the screen. Upon completion of the try block, execution branches to the  finally clause where the ResultSet and Statement objects are closed. After that, the  program terminates.    Notice that I have told you nothing about the ResultSet's methods. This is because we will  focus on them in Chapter 10. For now, it is important that you understand that the results from  the database are accessed through the ResultSet object returned from the executeQuery     method.   9.4.2 Defining Columns   In Example 9-5, a program invoked the executeQuery    method to execute a query against  the database and returned a result set. But what exactly happened when that executeQuery     method was called? First, the Oracle driver parsed the SQL statement. Next, it queried the  database to identify the data types for the columns specified in the SELECT statement. Then it  submitted the SELECT statement to the database for processing. Upon completion, the database  returned the results to the driver, and the driver in turn returned a ResultSet object to the  program. In this scenario, for every SELECT statement we execute, the driver must make two  round trips to the database: one to get the query's metadata and another to get the query's  results. If we could eliminate the first round trip to the database, we would get a 50%  improvement in efficiency and response time for a singleton -- that is, a one-row result -- query.  Oracle has a proprietary solution for this problem, called defining columns, which allows you to  predefine the column data types.    You can specify the column data types for a query before it is executed, thus avoiding the round  trip to the database to retrieve column metadata. You specify the data type for a column using the  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement object's define-ColumnType    method. This  proprietary method has the following signature:   defineColumnType int column_index, int type  throws SQLException   which breaks down as:  column_index    The relative number of the column in the SELECT statement, starting with 1 and  increasing from left to right    type    One of the java.sql.Types constants    In our last example, we used the following query:  select code, description, inactive_date  from   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE  order by code  The column code in this example is column index 1, and its database data type is VARCHAR2.  An appropriate java.sql.Types constant for an Oracle VARCHAR2 column would be  VARCHAR. The second column, description, is column index 2, and it would also be a  VARCHAR. The third column, inactive_date, is column index 3, and its database data type is  DATE. An appropriate java.sql.Types constant for an Oracle DATE column would be  TIMESTAMP.    To use the defineColumnType    method, you must use an OracleStatement object  instead of a Statement object or cast your Statement object to an OracleStatement, as in    Example 9-6. Notice in the example that the calls to defineColumnType    precede the  creation of the ResultSet.   Example 9-6. An application that predefines columns   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.text.*;  import oracle.jdbc.driver.*;     public class ExecuteDefinedSelect {    Connection conn;      public ExecuteDefinedSelect     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      ExecuteDefinedSelect s = new ExecuteDefinedSelect    ;         s.executeDefinedSelect        "select code, description, inactive_date " +        "from   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE " +        "order by code" ;    }      public void executeDefinedSelect String sql      throws IOException, SQLException {      Date       inactive_date = null;      DateFormat df            =        DateFormat.getDateInstance DateFormat.SHORT ;      int        rows          = 0;      ResultSet  rslt          = null;      Statement  stmt          = null;        System.out.println sql ;      try {        stmt = conn.createStatement    ;          OracleStatement stmt .defineColumnType 1, Types.VARCHAR ;           OracleStatement stmt .defineColumnType 2, Types.VARCHAR ;          OracleStatement stmt .defineColumnType 3, Types.TIMESTAMP ;         rslt = stmt.executeQuery sql ;        while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          System.out.print rslt.getString 1  + "  " ;          System.out.print rslt.getString 2  + "  " ;          inactive_date = rslt.getDate 3 ;            if  inactive_date != null              System.out.println df.format inactive_date  ;           else            System.out.println "NULL" ;        }        System.out.println Integer.toString rows  + " rows selected" ;        System.out.println " " ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;      }      finally {        if  rslt != null            try { rslt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ign ore  { }        if  stmt != null            try { stmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       }    }      protected void finalize          throws Throwable {       if  conn != null           try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }        super.finalize    ;    }  }  The program in Example 9-6, ExecuteDefinedSelect, is similar to that in Example 9-5 but  with two differences. First, the column types are predefined. After the Statement object is  created using the Connection.createStatement    method, and before it is used to  execute the SELECT statement with the Statement.executeQuery    method, I added three  calls to the OracleStatement.defineColumnType    method. These calls cast the JDBC  2.0 interface Statement object to Oracle's implementation of the interface, implemented by the  OracleStatement class, using the following syntax:    OracleStatement Statement    The first two calls to defineColumnType    set the data types for the result set's code and  description columns to VARCHAR. The third call sets the inactive_date column's data type  to TIMESTAMP.    The second difference between the two programs is that the use of defineColumnType     requires you to reference the columns by number rather than by name when you get the values;  otherwise, the driver is forced to query the database for metadata. Hence, in Example 9-6, you  see rslt.getString 1  instead of rslt.getString "code" . The same holds true for the  other columns as well.    The OCI driver returns the result set metadata and the first  row of data in a single round trip. Therefore, little is gained by  predefining your columns if you will use only the OCI driver.          The result of using Oracle's proprietary extension to define column types is that our sample  program takes only half the amount of time to query the database as before. Oracle also has  another proprietary extension that improves SELECT statement response time and efficiency.  This other extension is known as row prefetch.     9.4.3 Row Prefetch  Oracle's row prefetch extension is a proprietary extension to the JDBC standard that allows rows  in a result set to be sent across the network from the database to a client in batches, thereby  reducing the number of network round trips and increasing performance. According to the JDBC  specification, a JDBC driver should retrieve rows from a database one row at a time. With  Oracle's row prefetch extension, rows are, by default, retrieved in sets of 10. There's an exception  to this default. If the result set includes a large data type such as a BLOB, BFILE, CLOB, LONG  RAW, or LONG, the driver resets the row prefetch to 1.    You can set the default row prefetch value yourself in a Connection object. Consequently, all  subsequent object creations, such as those for Statement objects, from the Connection object  in question will use the new default value. To set the default prefetch value for a Connection  object, you must cast your Connection object to an OracleConnection and then call its  setDefaultRowPrefetch    method, passing it an int value representing the number of  rows to prefetch. For example, to set the default prefetch value to 20, you would use code such  as the following:   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection ... ;   OracleConnection conn  .setDefaultRowPrefetch 20 ;  You can also change the row prefetch value in a Statement object prior to using it to execute a  SELECT statement. Do this by casting the Statement object to an OracleStatement and  then call its setRowPrefetch    method. For example, to change a Statement object's row  prefetch value to 20, use the following code:   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;   OracleStatement stmt  .setRowPrefetch 20 ;  Interestingly enough, Oracle recommends the default row prefetch value of 10 for most situations.  You should experiment with different settings on small and large rows to determine if another  value is optimal for your situation.   9.5 OracleStatement Implements Statement  As you've experienced throughout this chapter, the Oracle implementation of Statement has  several extensions to the JDBC standard. Let's finish this chapter with a review of those  extensions. When you use a Connection object returned by an  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver object to create a Statement object, what is actually  returned is an OracleStatement object. The JDBC Statement object is an interface that  defines a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that states it implements  java.sql.Statement. oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement implements  java.sql.Statement, providing you with all the standard JDBC methods; plus, it implements  the following OracleStatement methods:   clearDefines     throws SQLException  defineColumnType int column_index, int type  throws SQLExcepti on  defineColumnType int column_index, int type, int max_size  throws  SQLException  defineColumnType int column_index, int typeCode, String typeName  throws  SQLException  String getOriginalSql     throws SQLException  String getRevisedSql     throws SQLException  int getRowPrefetch      int sendBatch     throws SQLException  setResultSetCache OracleResultSetCache cache  throws SQLException   setRowPrefetch int value  throws SQLException    You should now have a good grasp of how to use a Statement object to execute a SQL  statement. Let's move on to Chapter 10, where we'll cover everything you'd like to know, and  perhaps a little more, about ResultSets.   Chapter 10. Result Sets  As you saw in Chapter 9, when you execute a SELECT statement, the results are returned as a  java.sql.ResultSet object. You'll use the functionality of the ResultSet object to scroll  through the set of results; work with the values returned from the database; and make inserts,  updates, and deletes. In this chapter, we'll start by covering the various data types that can be  accessed using JDBC, and then we'll take a practical look at their use while considering the data  types available with Oracle. Next, we'll discuss the various ResultSet accessor methods. We'll  continue by discussing how to handle database NULL values in Java and spend much of the  second half of the chapter discussing scrollable and updateable result sets. Finally, we'll discuss  the Oracle proprietary extensions to the ResultSet object.   10.1 Basic Cursor Positioning  When you use the Statement object's executeQuery    method to query the database with a  SQL SELECT statement, the Statement object returns a ResultSet object. For the sake of  brevity, the returned ResultSet object contains the results of your query.    In the database, your data is organized as rows of columns in a table. Consequently, the result of  a query against the database is a result set that is also organized as rows of columns. A  ResultSet object provides a set of methods for selecting a specific row in the result set and  another set of methods for getting the values of the columns in the selected row.    When a ResultSet object is returned from a Statement object, its row pointer, or cursor, is  initially positioned before the first row of the result set. You then use the ResultSet object's  next    method to scroll forward through the result set one row at a time. The next    method  has the following signature:   boolean next      The next    method returns true if it successfully positions the cursor on the next row;  otherwise, it returns false. The next    method is typically used in a while loop:   ResultSet rslt = null;  Statement stmt = null;  try {    stmt = conn.createStatement    ;    rslt = stmt.executeQuery "select owner, table_name from all_tables" ;     while  rslt.next      {         Get the column values       . . .    }  }  This example scrolls through the results of the database query one row at a time until the result  set is exhausted. Alternatively, if you know you're working with a singleton SELECT, you may  want to use an if statement:   ResultSet rslt = null;  Statement stmt = null;  try {    stmt = conn.createStatement    ;    rslt = stmt.executeQuery "select owner, table_name from all_tables" ;       if  rslt.next      {         Get the column values       . . .    }  }  Here, the cursor is scrolled forward to the first row and then discarded under the assumption that  only one row was requested by the query. In both of these examples, the next    method has  been used to position the cursor to the next row, but no code has been provided to access the  column values of that row. How then, do you get the column values? I answer that question in the  next two sections. First, we must cover some background about which SQL data types can be  stored into which Java data types. We'll then cover how to use the ResultSet objects accessor  methods to retrieve the column values returned by a query.   10.2 Data Types  Whether you move data between two computers, computer systems, or programs written in  different programming languages, you'll need to identify which data types can be moved from one  setup to another and how. This problem arises when you retrieve data from an Oracle database  in a Java program and store data from a Java program in the database. It's a function of the  JDBC driver to know how to move or convert the data as it moves between your Java program  and Oracle, but you as the programmer must know what is possible or, more importantly, legal.  Table 10-1 lists the Oracle SQL data types and all their valid Java data type mappings.    Table 10-1.

These classes,  which all begin with oracle.sql, store Oracle SQL data in byte arrays similar to how it is stored  natively in the database.    For now, we will concern ourselves only with the SQL data types that are not streamable and are  available with relational SQL. These data types are:    We will cover the other data types in the chapters that follow. For the most part, since the CHAR,  RAW, and ROWID data types are rarely used, this leaves us with the Oracle SQL data types:  VARCHAR2, NUMBER, and DATE. The question is how to map these Oracle SQL types to Java  types. Although you can use any of the SQL-to-Java data type mappings in Table 10-1, I  suggest you use the following strategies:       For SQL character values, map VARCHAR2 to java.lang.String.      For SQL numeric values, map an integer type NUMBER to java.lang.Long or long,   and map a floating-point type NUMBER to java.lang.Double or double.        For SQL date and time values, map a DATE to java.sql.Timestamp.    Why? Well, let's start with the SQL character types. The only feasible mapping for character data,  unless you are writing data-processing-type stored procedures, is to use java.lang.String.  When designing tables for a database, I recommend you use VARCHAR2 for all character types  that are not large objects. As I stated in Chapter 8, there is no good reason to use an Oracle  CHAR data type. CHAR values are fixed-length character values right-padded with space  characters. Because they are right-padded with spaces, they cause comparison problems when  compared with VARCHAR2 values.    For NUMBER values, there are two possible types of values you can encounter. The first is an  integer type NUMBER definition such as NUMBER 18  or NUMBER. You can map such integer  values to a java.lang.Integer or int, but you'll have only nine significant digits. By using an  integer, you constrain your program in such a way that it may require modifications at a later date.  It's much easier to use a data type that can hold all possible values now and in the future. For  Java, this is java.math.BigDecimal. However, using BigDecimal is inefficient if full  precision is not needed, so I recommend using java.lang.Long or long, both of which have  18 significant digits for precision. For floating-point type NUMBER definitions such as  NUMBER 16,2  or NUMBER, I suggest you use a java.lang.Double or double, which also  have 18 significant digits for precision for the same reason -- you don't want to have to modify  your program later to handle larger values than you first anticipated. In designing tables for a  database, I recommend you don't constrain NUMBER columns unless there is a compelling  reason to do so. That means defining both integer and floating-point values as NUMBER.    For DATE values, I suggest you use java.sql.Timestamp instead of java.sql.Date or  java.lang.Time for two reasons. First, Timestamp supports the parsing of SQL92 Timestamp  escape syntax. Second, it's good programming practice to set times manually to midnight if you  are using only the date portion. The fact that Timestamp supports SQL92 escape syntax makes  it easier to set the time to midnight.    Remember what I said earlier: "...unless you are writing data-processing-type stored procedures."  Since conversions take place whenever an Oracle SQL data type is accessed as a Java data  type, it can be more efficient to use the proprietary Oracle Java types such as  oracle.sql.CHAR, oracle.sql.DATE, and oracle.sql.NUMBER in some situations. If you  are writing a data-intensive program such as a conversion program to read data from one set of  tables and write it to another set, then you should consider using the proprietary Oracle data  types. To use them, you'll have to cast your java.sql.ResultSet to an  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleResultSet.    Now that you have a thorough understanding of which data type mappings are possible and a  mapping strategy, let's look at the accessor methods you can use to perform the mapping and get  the values from a ResultSet object.   10.3 Accessor Methods  As I alluded to earlier in the section on cursor positioning, the ResultSet object has a set of  methods that allow you to get access to the column values for a row in a result set. These  ResultSet accessor methods are affectionately called the getXXX    methods. The XXX is a  placeholder for one of the Java data types from Table 10-1. Well, almost. When the XXX is  replaced with a class name such as Double, which is a wrapper class for the primitive double,  the getXXX    method returns the primitive data type, not an instance of the class. For example,  getString    returns a String object, whereas getDouble     Double is the name of a  wrapper class for the primitive data type double  returns a double primitive type, not an  instance of the wrapper class Double. The getXXX    methods have two signatures:     dataType getdataType  int columnIndex     dataType getdataType  String columnName   which breaks down as:  dataType    One of the Java data types from Table 10-1. For primitive data types that have wrapper  classes, the class name is appended to get. For example, the primitive double data  type has a wrapper class named Double, so the get method is named getDouble   ,  but the primitive data type's value is passed as the second parameter, not as an instance  of its wrapper class.    The position of the column in the select list, from left to right, starting with 1.    columnIndex    columnName    The name or alias for the column in the select list. This value is not case-sensitive.    Using the columnIndex form of the getXXX    methods is more efficient than the  columnName form, because the driver does not have to deal with the extra steps of parsing the  column name, finding it in the select list, and turning it into a number. In addition, The  columnName form does not work if you use the Oracle extension I talked about in Chapter 9 to  predefine column types to improve efficiency. I suggest you use the columnIndex form  whenever possible.    Let's take a look at Example 10-1, which uses the getXXX    methods.   Example 10-1. Using the getXXX    methods   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.text.*;    public class GetXXXMethods {    Connection conn;      public GetXXXMethods     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      new GetXXXMethods  .process    ;    }      public void process     throws IOException, SQLException {      double    age        = 0;        long      person_id  = 0;      String    name       = null;      Timestamp birth_date = null;      int       rows       = 0;      ResultSet rslt       = null;      Statement stmt       = null;      try {        stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select person_id, " +         "       last_name', 'first_name name, " +           "       birth_date, " +         "         months_between  sysdate, birth_date     12   age " +           "from   PERSON " +          "where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly' " +          "and    first_name = 'Tim'" ;        if  rslt.next      {          rows++;          person_id  = rslt.getLong 1 ;          name       = rslt.getString 2 ;          birth_date = rslt.getTimestamp 3 ;          age        = rslt.getDouble 4 ;            System.out.println "person_id  = " +            new Long person_id .toString     ;          System.out.println "name       = " + name ;          System.out.println "birth_date = " +            new SimpleDateFormat "MM dd yyyy" .format birth_date  ;           System.out.println "age        = " +            new DecimalFormat "0." .format age  ;        }          rslt.close    ;        rslt = null;        stmt.close    ;        stmt = null;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;      }      finally {        if  rslt != null            try { rslt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  stmt != null            try { stmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignor e  { }      }    }      protected void finalize          throws Throwable {      if  conn != null          try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       super.finalize    ;    }  }    Our sample program, GetXXXMethods, exercises four of the getXXX    methods. The first,  getLong   , returns the person row's primary key, a NUMBER, as a primitive data type long.  The second, getString   , returns the person's concatenated name, a VARCHAR2, as a  String. The third, getTimestamp   , returns the person's birth date, a DATE, as a  Timestamp, and the last, getDouble   , returns the person's current age, a NUMBER, as a  primitive type double.    But what happens when a returned database value is NULL? For example, what would the  primitive data type double for age equal had there been no birth date? It would have been 0.  That doesn't make much sense, does it? So how do you detect and handle NULL database  values?   10.3.1 Handling NULL Values  SQL's use of NULL values and Java's use of null are different concepts. In a database, when a  column has a NULL value, that means that the column's value is unknown. In Java, a null means  that an object type variable has been initialized with no reference to an instance of an object. The  key point here is that a Java variable that can hold an object reference can be null, but a primitive  data type cannot. And when a Java variable is null, it does not mean that its value is unknown,  but that there is no object reference stored in the variable. So how do you handle SQL NULL  values in Java? There are three tactics you can use:       Avoid using getXXX    methods that return primitive data types.      Use wrapper classes for primitive data types, and use the ResultSet object's   wasNull    method to test whether the wrapper class variable that received the value  returned by the getXXX    method should be set to null.       Use primitive data types and the ResultSet object's wasNull    method to test  whether the primitive variable that received the value returned by the getXXX     method should be set to an acceptable value that you've chosen to represent a NULL.    10.3.1.1 Avoiding the use of primitive data types   Our first tactic is to not use any of the getXXX    methods that return a primitive data type. This  works because the getXXX    methods that return an object reference return a null object  reference when the corresponding column in the database has a NULL value. Primarily, this  means that we don't use getInt    , getDouble   , and so forth for numeric data types. The  SQL DATE and VARCHAR2 data types do not have a Java primitive data type that they can be  mapped to, so with those types you are always retrieving object references. Instead, for SQL  NUMBER columns, use java.math.BigDecimal variables to hold references from the  ResultSet object's getBigDecimal    method, as shown in Example 10-2.   Example 10-2.

There is one drawback to this tactic: the BigDecimal object is  expensive compared to the primitive numeric data types in terms of both memory consumption  and CPU cycles when it comes to computation. A middle-of-the-road solution is to use wrapper  classes to store a column's value and the ResultSet object's wasNull    method to detect  NULL values.    10.3.1.2 Using wrapper classes   Our second tactic, then, is to use wrapper classes for primitive data types complemented with the  ResultSet object's wasNull    method. For any database column that normally uses an  object variable, such as SQL VARCHAR2 using String, it's business as usual. For a SQL  NUMBER, use the appropriate wrapper class -- for example, use the Double wrapper class for a  double value -- and then call the wasNull    method to determine whether the last getXXX     method call's corresponding column had a NULL value. The wasNull    method has the  following signature:   boolean wasNull      wasNull    returns true if the last getXXX    method call's underlying column had a NULL  value. If the getXXX    method call does reference a column with a NULL value, set the  wrapper class variable to null as in the process    method shown in Example 10-3.   Example 10-3.

After making the call to getDouble   , the  program calls the ResultSet object's wasNull    method to check for NULL values. If there  are NULL values in the underlying column, then the program sets the aDouble variable to a  null reference. Here's the output from the program:     before wasNull     a Double = 0.0  after  wasNull     a Double = null  Notice how the getDouble    method returns a double value of 0.0? That's because all  primitives in Java cannot be null, and therefore, a default value is given to them when they are  created. If getting 0.0 back for a column with NULL values is OK, then you don't have to be  concerned about handling NULL values at all.    This tactic of using wrapper classes is the most efficient method for handling NULL values, but it  still requires extra memory and CPU cycles along with additional programming effort. If your  numeric values have the right characteristics, you might try the third tactic, which is to use some  agreed upon value to flag NULL values.    10.3.1.3 Representing NULL with a special value   The third tactic for handling NULL values is to use a primitive data type to hold the data returned  from a getXXX    method, then use wasNull    and a predetermined special value to flag  NULL values. For example, in an accounting system report in which you add up different columns  to equal a total amount, you may set a Java double to hold a value retrieved from a database to  0 when the value from the database is NULL. Or you may use a numeric value that you know  cannot be valid, such as -1.0. Example 10-4 uses -1.0 to represent NULL values.    Example 10-4.

This assumes that the column will never have negative  values, which is quite restrictive. However, if you can use this tactic, or better yet, use a  primitive's default value  0.0 for doubles , this is the most efficient means of dealing with NULL  values.    Before we move on to another topic, let's not forget to state the obvious. If the column definition in  the database includes the NOT NULL constraint, then you do not need to check for null values at  all!    Now that you know how to handle NULL values, let's take a look at the truly dynamic features of a  ResultSet, namely those implemented by the ResultSetMetaData object.   10.3.2 ResultSetMetaData  Up to this point, we've been using a getXXX    method to retrieve a column value, knowing  ahead of time the data type that was appropriate for a corresponding database column. But what  if you didn't know? Perhaps you want to build a Java query tool to replace SQL*Plus. A tool like    that would allow you to enter any query. How would your program know how many columns are  in the result set and what their data types are? To answer this question, you can use the methods  provided by the ResultSetMetaData object.   10.3.2.1 Getting the ResultSetMetaData object   After you execute a SELECT statement and retrieve the ResultSet object, you can use the  ResultSet object's getMetaData    method to retrieve a ResultSetMetaData object that  will give you all the details you need to know to dynamically manipulate the ResultSet. The  getMetaData    method has the following signature:   ResultSetMetaData getMetaData      10.3.2.2 Getting column information   The ResultSetMetaData object has a set of get and is methods you can use to dynamically  determine information about a result set at runtime. The first method in the list that follows,  getColumnCount   , is the only method that is not column-specific. It returns the number of  columns in the result set, starting with 1. Following is a list of the get and is methods. For most  of the methods in this list, you'll pass the column number as a parameter.   int getColumnCount       Gets the number of columns in the ResultSet.   String getSchemaName int column     Gets a column's table's schema name. Unfortunately, this method does not work for  JDBC driver Version 8.1.6.    String getTableName int column     String getCatalogName int column     String getColumnName int column     String getColumnLabel int column     Gets a column's table name. Unfortunately, this method does not work for JDBC driver  Version 8.1.6.    Gets a column's table's catalog name. Since there are no catalogs in Oracle, this method  has no use.    Gets a column's name. This should return the column name as it exists in the database,  but it returns the alias for a column if an alias was used.    Gets the suggested column title for printouts and displays. This method returns the  column name or the alias if one was used.    String getColumnTypeName int column     Gets a column's database-specific data type name.   int getColumnType int column     Gets a column's java.sql.Types constant.    String getColumnClassName int column     Gets the fully qualified Java class name of the object that will be returned by a call to the  ResultSet.getObject    method.    int getColumnDisplaySize int column     Gets the column's normal maximum width in characters.    int getPrecision int column      Gets the number of decimal digits supported by a NUMBER column.   int getScale int column     int isNullable int column     Gets the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in a NUMBER column.    Indicates whether the column is nullable. This method returns one of the following  ResultSetMetaData constants:    static int columnNoNulls    The column may not contain NULL.    static int columnNullable    The column may contain NULL.    static int columnNullableUnknown    The nullability of the column is unknown.   boolean isAutoIncrement int column     Indicates whether the column is automatically numbered and is thus read-only. There is  currently no use for this method with Oracle, because Oracle does not implement auto- incrementing columns.    boolean isCaseSensitive int column     Indicates whether a column's case matters.    boolean isCurrency int column     Indicates whether the column is a cash value. Oracle does not have a money or currency  SQL data type, so this method returns true for any numeric SQL data type.    boolean isSigned int column     boolean isSearchable int column     Indicates whether values in the column are signed numbers.    Indicates whether the column can be used in a WHERE clause.    boolean isReadOnly int column     boolean isWritable int column     Indicates whether a column is definitely not writeable.    Indicates whether it is possible for a write on the column to succeed.   boolean isDefinitelyWritable int column     Indicates whether a write on the column will definitely succeed.    10.3.2.3 Getting column values   When you are retrieving column values from a result set but do not know which data type they  are, you can use a special getXXX    method, getObject   , to retrieve a column value as  an instance of the Java class Object. Since all Java objects are descendants of the class  Object, you can cast the retrieved Object to a specific descendant type. You'll utilize this  technique if you use the ResultSetMetaData object. If you combine the getColumnCount     method with the getColumnClassName    and ResultSet object's getObject    method,  you can dynamically get the column values of a result set. Here's how it works. The  getColumnCount    method returns the actual number of columns in the result set. You can  use this number in a for loop to retrieve the column values for each column and use the  getColumnClassName    method to determine the fully qualified Java class name of the    object that is returned when you call the getObject    method. You can then use the class  name to create an appropriate variable to hold the value returned by getObject    and  perform an appropriate cast. One of the four overloaded getObject    method signatures is:   Object getObject int columnIndex   If you call the getColumnClassName    method, and it returns java.lang.BigDecimal,  then you'll create a BigDecimal variable and cast the results of a call to getObject    to a  BigDecimal:   BigDecimal column1 =  BigDecimal  rslt.getObject 1   10.3.2.4 A ResultSetMetaData example   Now that we've covered the ResultSetMetaData object's capabilities, let's take a look at  Example 10-5, which uses some of the ResultSetMetaData methods to dynamically retrieve  the result set data.    In our sample program, TestMetaData, the program uses the Statement object's execute     method to enable the program to execute any SQL statement. If the execute    method  returns true, a ResultSet object is available, and the program proceeds by calling the  Statement object's getResultSet    method to retrieve the ResultSet object. Otherwise,  the program calls the Statement object's getUpdateCount    method to get the number of  rows affected by the SQL statement just executed.    If a ResultSet object was returned, the program continues by calling the ResultSet object's  getMetaData    method to retrieve the result set's ResultSetMetaData object. Using that  object, the program calls the getColumnCount    method to determine the number of columns  in the result set. Next, the program enters a while loop where it iterates through the entire result  set one row at a time. For the first row, the program calls a helper method, formatHeader   ,  passing the values returned by the ResultSetMetaData object's getColumnLabel   ,  getColumnClassName   , and getColumnDisplaySize    methods. The  formatHeader    method creates an appropriate heading for each column. For each row, the  program calls a helper method, formatColumn   , passing the values returned by the  ResultSet object's getObject    method and the ResultSetMetaData object's  getColumnClassName    and getColumnDisplaySize    methods. Both helper methods  work in a similar fashion, so let's just talk about formatColumn    in detail.    In formatColumn   , the program initializes a String value to an empty set. For each  possible class name, the program tests to see if the object is a null reference. If it is,  formatColumn    returns a properly padded blank String object; otherwise, it creates a  String representation of the corresponding object and returns it right- or left-padded with  spaces.

     out.append in.substring 0, least  ;      int          fill  = length - out.length    ;      for  int i=0;i < fill;i++  {         out.append pad ;      }      return out.toString    ;    }      private String lpad String in, int length, char pad  {       StringBuffer out   = new StringBuffer length ;

     }      return out.toString    ;    }      protected void finalize          throws Throwable {      if  conn != null          try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       super.finalize    ;    }   }  Instead of using the ResultSetMetaData object's getColumnClassName    method, the  program can use the Java instanceof operator to determine the class to which an object  belongs. For example:   private String formatColumn Object object, int displaySize  {     String value  = "";    if       object instanceof java.lang.String  {     value = rpad  String object, displaySize, ' ' ;    }    else if  object instanceof java.math.BigDecimal  {      BigDecimal n =  BigDecimal object;     value = lpad n.toString    , 9, ' ' ;    }    else if  object instanceof java.sql.Timestamp  {     Timestamp ts =  Timestamp object;     value = rpad ts.toString    , 21, ' ' ;    }    else if  object == null  {     value = rpad value, displaySize, ' ' ;    }    else {     System.err.println "Unsupported class: " +       object.getClass  .getName     ;    }    return value + " ";   }  One problem with using instanceof is that you can't identify an object's type when the  underlying database column is NULL, because getObject    will return a null reference. For  this reason, it is better to use the ResultSetMetaData object's getColumnClassName     method to determine the class of an object.    As far as the ResultSetMetaData object is concerned, we have only scratched the surface  here, but if you have to work with a SQL statement built dynamically in your program, you'll know  that the JDBC API has all the enabling methods you need in the DatabaseMetaData and  ResultSetMetaData objects.    Up to this point all we've been talking about is getting the data from a ResultSet; we have  conveniently skipped any discussion about row positioning capabilities. So let's tackle that topic  next.   10.4 Scrollable, Updateable Result Sets    With JDBC 1.0, all result sets could scroll only forward and were read-only. With JDBC 2.0, result  sets can scroll in both directions and position the cursor randomly. They are also updateable. To  implement this functionality, the Connection object's createStatement    method was  overloaded with the following signature:   Statement createStatement    int resultSetType,   int resultSetConcurrency   For resultSetType, there are three possible ResultSet constants you can use:   TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY    A forward-only cursor.   TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE    A scrollable, positionable result set that is not sensitive to changes made to the database  while the ResultSet object is open. You would have to create a new ResultSet object  to see changes made to the database.    TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE    A scrollable, positionable result set that can see changes made to the database while the  ResultSet object is open. Changes made at the database level to any of the column  values in the result set are visible.    For resultSetConcurrency, there are two possible ResultSet constants you can use:   CONCUR_READ_ONLY    A read-only ResultSet   CONCUR_UPDATABLE    An updateable ResultSet   Since scrollability and sensitivity are independent of updateability, we end up with six possible  ResultSet categories:   Forward-only read-only   Forward-only updateable   Scroll-insensitive read-only   Scroll-insensitive updateable   Scroll-sensitive read-only   Scroll-sensitive updateable   Oracle implements scrollability by using a client-side memory cache to store the rows from a  scrollable result set. Because of this, you should consider carefully which result sets you make  scrollable. A large result set could negatively impact the performance, or cause the failure of, your  JVM due to excessive memory consumption. To support updateability, Oracle uses the  proprietary SQL data type, ROWID, which uniquely identifies each row in the database. The  Oracle JDBC driver automatically retrieves the ROWID for each row in a scrollable result set.    The default createStatement    method, with the  signature Statement createStatement   , creates a  forward-only read-only result set.          10.4.1 Eligible SELECT Statement Rules    The SELECT statement you specify determines whether the ResultSet type and concurrency  you specified during the creation of a Statement object is what you will get after the execution of  the SQL statement. To create a scroll-sensitive ResultSet, you must:       Select against only one table     Explicitly specify the columns for the SELECT statement     Not use an ORDER BY clause   To create an updateable ResultSet, you must:      Select against only one table     Explicitly specify columns for the SELECT statement from a table     Select all nonnullable columns from the table if you plan to insert new rows via the result   set       Not use an ORDER BY clause   If you can add the pseudo-column ROWID to your list of columns in a SELECT statement, then  the statement can probably be used to create a scroll-sensitive, updateable ResultSet.   10.4.1.1 Downgrade rules   If you attempt to create a result set with an unsuitable SELECT statement, the following  downgrade rules apply:            If you specified TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, but the JDBC driver can't support it, the  type is downgraded to TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSTIVE. If that can't be supported, then the  type becomes TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY.    If you specified CONCUR_UPDATABLE, but the JDBC driver cannot support it, the  concurrency is downgraded to TYPE_READ_ONLY.    10.4.1.2 Verifying the ResultSet category   You can call the ResultSet object's getType    and getConcurrency    methods after a  SELECT statement has been executed to verify the category of the returned result set. The  method signatures are:   int getType       Returns a ResultSet object's type constant   int getConcurrency       Returns a ResultSet object's concurrency constant    10.4.2 Scrollability  When you execute a SELECT statement with the executeQuery    method, you are returned  a ResultSet object. Initially, this ResultSet object's row pointer, or cursor, is positioned before  the first row. Typically, you'll use a while loop with the ResultSet object's next    method,  which returns true if there is another row to position to. You saw several examples of this in  Chapter 9. Here's a snippet of code from Example 9-5, ExecuteSelect:   stmt = conn.createStatement    ;    rslt = stmt.executeQuery sql ;  while  rslt.next      {   rows++;   System.out.print rslt.getString "code"  + "  " ;   System.out.print rslt.getString "description"  + "  " ;   inactive_date = rslt.getDate "inactive_date" ;   if  inactive_date != null      System.out.println df.format inactive_date  ;   else    System.out.println "NULL" ;  }  After the first call to next   , the cursor points to the first row of the result set. As the while  loop executes, the cursor points to each successive row of the result set until all the results have  been referenced, at which point the while loop ends.    There are two types of result sets when it comes to scrollability: forward-only and scrollable. The  first is identified by the integer constant TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY and, as the constant's name  implies, can scroll forward only one row at a time. With this type of a result set, you can use only  the following methods:   boolean next       Moves forward one row   boolean isBeforeFirst       boolean isFirst       boolean isAfterLast       Tests to see if the cursor is positioned before the first row   Tests to see if the cursor is positioned on the first row   Tests to see if the cursor is positioned after the last row   The second type, scrollable, is identified by two integer constants: TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE  and TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE. With these two types you can use the prior cursor positioning  methods as well as the following:   int getFetchDirection       Gets the current fetch direction. The value returned will be one of these two constants:  FETCH_FORWARD or FETCH_REVERSE.    int getRow       Gets the current row number.   setFetchDirection int direction     Sets the fetch direction. You can use the constants FETCH_FORWARD or  FETCH_REVERSE.       Oracle's JDBC driver for 8.1.6 does not support  FETCH_REVERSE. If you need to fetch reversed, use the  afterlast    method to move to the position after the end  of the result set and then use the previous    method to  scroll backwards through the result set.       beforeFirst        Moves the cursor to a position before the first row.   boolean first       Moves the cursor to the first row. This method returns true if it succeeds and false  otherwise  i.e., if there are no rows in the result set .    boolean absolute int row     Moves the cursor to the specified row. If the row is a positive value, the position is relative  to the beginning of the result set. If the row is a negative value, the position is relative to  the end of the result set. If a value for the row places the cursor on an invalid row number   in other words, one that is before the first, or after the last, row , the cursor is moved  before the first row or after the last row, respectively.    boolean relative int rows     Moves the cursor to a specified row relative to the current row. The rows parameter may  be either positive or negative. A positive value moves the cursor forward, and a negative  value moves the cursor backward. If a value for rows represents an invalid row number  that is before the first or after the last row, the cursor is moved before the first or after the  last row, respectively.    boolean previous       Moves the cursor to the previous row.   boolean last       afterLast       boolean isLast       Moves the cursor to the last row.   Moves the cursor beyond the last row.   Tests to see if the cursor is on the last row.   Example 10-6 exercises all these positioning methods.   Example 10-6.

Most often,  CONCUR_UPDATABLE is used in conjunction with TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE to give the  programmer total control of the result set. To support updateability, the resulting ResultSet  object implements a second set of accessor methods, updateXXX    methods, to set column  values for an insert or update operation. These updateXXX    methods have the following  signatures:   update  dataType  int columnIndex,   dataType x   update  dataType  String columnName,   dataType x   which break down as:  dataType    One of the Java data types from Table 10-1. For primitive data types that have wrapper  classes, the class name is appended to update. For example, the primitive double data  type has a wrapper class named Double, so the update method is named  updateDouble   , but the primitive data type's value is passed as the second  parameter, not as an instance of its wrapper class.    The number of the column in the select list, from left to right, starting with 1.    columnIndex    columnName    x    The name or alias for the column in the select list.   The new column value.    As with the getXXX    methods, the updateXXX    methods that use columnIndex are  more efficient than those that use columnName.   10.4.3.1 Inserting a new row into a result set   To perform an insert operation on a ResultSet, first call the ResultSet object's  moveToInsertRow    method to position the cursor to a blank, insertable row. Next, call one or  more of the required updateXXX    methods to set the values for each column. The  updateXXX    methods are used to set column values for updateable result sets in a way  similar to the way in which the getXXX    methods get values from columns. When inserting a  row into a result set, you must set the column values for all NOT NULL columns. It is not  necessary to set the values for nullable columns; their unset values will be NULL.    When you are done setting the column values with the updateXXX    methods, call the  ResultSet object's insertRow    method to generate and send the appropriate INSERT  statement to the database. You may then return to the row position prior to the call to the  moveToInsertRow    method by calling the moveToCurrentRow    method. Positioning to  another row before calling the insertRow    method cancels the insert operation.    Keep in mind that any row inserted into the database from a ResultSet object insert is not  visible to the current result set. Nor will any row inserted by another user of the database be  visible to the current result set. You must recreate the ResultSet object to see any newly  inserted rows.    10.4.3.2 Updating a row in a result set   To perform an update operation, first position the cursor in the desired row using any of the  cursor position methods we have discussed that are appropriate for the ResultSet type. Next,  use the updateXXX    methods as necessary to update the values of columns. If you wish to  set a nullable column to NULL, use the ResultSetobject's updateNull    method. When  you're finished updating the columns in the result set, call the ResultSet object's updateRow     method to generate the appropriate UPDATE statement and send it to the database.  Positioning to another row or calling the ResultSet object's cancelRowUpdate    method  before calling updateRow    cancels the update, restoring columns to their original values.    Updates made in your ResultSet object will be visible in your result set, while updates made by  other database users will be visible to your result set only after a call is made to the ResultSet  object's refreshRow    method. The refreshRow    method refreshes the current row, and  possibly others adjacent to it in the result set, depending on the number of rows you have  specified for the JDBC driver to prefetch. refreshRow    is called implicitly when you update a  row  using updateRow    .You can also call it explicitly whenever you desire.   10.4.3.3 Deleting a row in a result set   To perform a delete operation, first position the cursor in the desired row. Then call the  ResultSet object's deleteRow    method to generate the appropriate DELETE statement  and send it to the database. Your delete operation will be visible in a scrollable ResultSet  object but not in a forward-only one. In a scrollable result set, the preceding row becomes the  current row after a delete operation. Deletes performed by other users will not be visible to your  ResultSet object. You must recreate the ResultSet object to detect these external deletes.   10.4.3.4 Update visibility and detection    Visibility and detection are two distinct concepts. Visibility is whether your result set can see  changes performed internally or externally. Detection is whether your result set is notified when  an external change takes place.    Oracle ResultSet objects do not have any detection  capability, although it appears from the JDBC specification  that they should.       Operations that take place in your result set are called internal changes. Internal insert operations  are not visible to any of the three ResultSet types: TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,  TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, or TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE. Internal update operations are  visible for all three. Internal deletes are visible for TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE and  TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE result sets but not for TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY.    Outside changes -- those outside the current program's transaction context -- are visibly only if  they are updates, because an update does an implicit refresh. This is true even for changes  performed by a trigger on a table updated as part of the current transaction. External inserts or  deletes are never visible.       Since an Oracle ResultSet object does not have detection  capability, its detection methods -- rowInserted   ,  rowUpdated   , and rowDeleted    -- always return  false.    The following are the nine DatabaseMetaData methods you can call to determine the current  support for visibility and detection. They take one of the three ResultSet type constants for an  argument, and they all can throw a SQLException.   boolean ownInsertsAreVisible int   boolean ownUpdatesAreVisible int   boolean ownDeletesAreVisible int   boolean othersInsertsAreVisible int   boolean othersUpdatesAreVisible int   boolean othersDeletesAreVisible int   boolean insertsAreDetected int   boolean updatesAreDetected int   boolean deletesAreDetected int   As mentioned earlier, an updateRow    method call for a SCROLL_SENSITIVE ResultSet  object makes an implicit refreshRow    call for an updated row. What actually happens when  this refresh occurs is that the entire prefetch buffer, typically 10 rows of data, is refreshed. Only  the prefetch buffer is refreshed, not the whole result set. And even with the refresh, any internal  or external inserts and any external deletes do not become visible.       The Oracle JDBC driver Version 8.1.6 does not automatically  enforce write locks or check for update conflicts. You are  responsible for managing these issues manually!    Since Oracle uses ROWID to identify the rows in the database for updating, it is almost always  appropriate to use a pessimistic locking scheme to ensure you don't overwrite someone else's  changes  I cover this issue thoroughly in Chapter 18 . To accomplish this, you should use the             FOR UPDATE NOWAIT clause with your SELECT statement to lock the rows you retrieve from  the database. You must also turn off auto-commit; otherwise, the first insert, update, or delete  operation will release the locks. When you use the NOWAIT option with the FOR UPDATE  clause, you will get the following error in a SQLException if another user has already locked the  resource:   ORA-00054: resource busy and acquire with NOWAIT specified   Table 10-2 summarizes the effects that the three different ResultSet types have on visibility.

In the process    method, the  program wraps standard input with a BufferedReader, so the person executing the program  can pause execution at each step to see its effect from another session. Then the program turns  off auto-commit and proceeds by creating a scroll-sensitive, updateable Statement object,  which in turn is used to create an appropriate ResultSet object. The SELECT statement  executed by the Statement object retrieves a list of codes from the  PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE table. Next, the program loops through the result set using a  while loop with the next    method. In the while loop, the program tests for an entry with a  code of SDL. If it finds that entry, it deletes it. After the while loop, the program inserts a new  row. Since this new row is not visible, and we want to update it, the program continues by  recreating the result set. It then updates the code SDL entry's description. After that, the  modifications are committed to the database.    Did you notice that, contrary to my own advice, I did not use the FOR UPDATE NOWAIT clause?  That's because the 8.1.6 implementation of updateable result sets has a known defect wherein it  reports the following error in a SQLException if you attempt to use FOR UPDATE NOWAIT:   ORA-00907: missing right parenthesis  This brings up a good question. Given the current FOR UPDATE clause defect with Oracle  ResultSet objects, what practical uses do they have? Personally, I am not a fan of the current  implementation of result sets, partly because I don't like to use pessimistic locking. It is more  efficient to use other means to update the database. So let's take a look at reasons not to use  updateable ResultSet objects.   10.4.4 Reasons Not to Use Updateable Result Sets  The first type of updateable ResultSet object is a forward-only result set. Using my imagination,  I guess that forward-only result sets can be used to batch update one or more of a table's  columns. However, an update statement with a simple or complex, single- or multicolumn,  subquery can most often accomplish this kind of update. Using a procedural solution for a set  problem is one of the mistakes many developers make. We need to use the inherent capabilities  of SQL whenever possible.    If the process of determining the updateable data for an update statement is too complex for a  subquery, it would be more efficient to use a batched, prepared statement in Java to make the  updates than a result set. I discuss batched, prepared statements in Chapter 11.    The second type of updateable ResultSet object is a scroll-insensitive result set. You use this  with the FOR UPDATE NOWAIT clause. In this scenario, you would first turn off auto-commit.  Then you would perform your query using the FOR UPDATE NOWAIT clause. Using FOR  UPDATE NOWAIT in your query causes Oracle to immediately lock all the rows in the table that  meet your query's WHERE clause criteria. The exception is if someone else has previously  locked one or more of those rows, in which case, you get a SQLException. You can use FOR  UPDATE without the NOWAIT option, but then your program may wait indefinitely for access to  the desired rows while another user has them locked. You can use a scroll-insensitive result set  for this type of update, because once your program has locked the desired rows, no one else can  change them. Consequently, it's not necessary to see external changes, a capability a scroll-   sensitive ResultSet object would give you, because no one else can make any changes to the  rows in your pessimistically locked result set. However, as I have already stated, there is currently  a defect in the driver that makes this approach impossible to use.    The third and last possibility is to use a scroll-sensitive ResultSet object. It has the same  problems as the scroll-insensitive ResultSet plus, since ROWID is all that is used in the  WHERE clause of the subsequently generated update statement, you have no guarantee you  won't destroy another user's valid changes.    I'm sure, even with the problems I've just discussed, that some of you will find valid reasons to  use updateable result sets. In time, I believe updateable ResultSet objects will further evolve  into a more useful implementation, but for now, I would use them cautiously.   10.5 ResultSet Is an OracleResultSet  The ResultSet class we have been discussing, java.sql.ResultSet, is an interface that is  implemented by oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleResultSet. Beyond the standard JDBC 2.0  implementation, OracleResultSet has the following proprietary methods, all of which can  throw a SQLException:   ARRAY getARRAY int columnIndex    ARRAY getARRAY String columnName    BFILE getBfile int columnIndex    BFILE getBfile String columnName    BFILE getBFILE int columnIndex    BFILE getBFILE String columnName    BLOB getBLOB int columnIndex    BLOB getBLOB String columnName    CHAR getCHAR int columnIndex    CHAR getCHAR String columnName    CLOB getCLOB int columnIndex    CLOB getCLOB String columnName    ResultSet getCursor int columnIndex    ResultSet getCURSOR String columnName    CustomDatum getCustomDatum int columnIndex, CustomDatumFactory factory    CustomDatum getCustomDatum String columnName, CustomDa tumFactory  factory   DATE getDATE int columnIndex    DATE getDATE String columnName    NUMBER getNUMBER int columnIndex    NUMBER getNUMBER String columnName    Datum getOracleObject int columnIndex    Datum getOracleObject String columnName    RAW getRAW int columnIndex    RAW getRAW String columnName    REF getREF int columnIndex    REF getREF String columnName    ROWID getROWID int columnIndex    ROWID getROWID String columnName    STRUCT getSTRUCT int columnIndex    STRUCT getSTRUCT String columnName      updateArray int columnIndex, Array x   updateArray String columnName, Array x   updateARRAY int columnIndex, ARRAY x   updateARRAY String columnName, ARRAY x   updateBfile int columnIndex, BFILE X     updateBfile String columnName, BFILE x   updateBFILE int columnIndex, BFILE x   updateBFILE String columnName, BFILE x   updateBlob int columnIndex, Blob x   updateBlob String columnName, Blob x   updateBLOB int columnIndex, BLOB x   updateBLOB String columnName, BLOB x   updateCHAR int columnIndex, CHAR x   updateCHAR String columnName, CHAR x   updateClob int columnIndex, Clob x   updateClob String columnName, Clob x   updateCLOB int columnIndex, CLOB x   updateCLOB String columnName, CLOB x   updateCustomDatum int columnIndex, CustomDatum x   updateCustomDatum String columnName, CustomDatum x   updateDATE int columnIndex, DATE x   updateDATE String columnName, DATE x   updateNUMBER int columnIndex, NUMBER x   updateNUMBER String columnName, NUMBER x   updateOracleObject int columnIndex, Datum x   updateOracleObject String columnName, Datum x   updateRAW int columnIndex, RAW x   updateRAW String columnName, RAW x   updateRef int columnIndex, Ref x   updateRef String columnName, Ref x   updateREF int columnIndex, REF x   updateREF String columnName, REF x   updateROWID int columnIndex, ROWID x   updateROWID String columnName, ROWID x   updateSTRUCT int columnIndex, STRUCT x   updateSTRUCT String columnName, STRUCT x   You may have noticed that up to this point, we have not taken a look at large objects  LOBs  or  object data types. As I stated earlier, we'll cover objects in Part III. As for large data types, we  need to cover another type of statement object, a PreparedStatement, to have a complete  discussion about the large object data types: BFILE, BLOB, CLOB, LONG, and LONG RAW. So  let's continue our discussion of JDBC with prepared statements in Chapter 11.   Chapter 11. Prepared Statements  Similar to their statement counterparts, prepared statements can be used to insert, update,  delete, or select data. However, prepared statements are precompiled statements that can be  reused to execute identical SQL statements with different values more efficiently. They make only  one trip to the database for metadata, whereas statements make a round trip with each  execution. In addition, since bind variables are used, the database compiles and caches the  prepared SQL statement and reuses it on subsequent executions to improve the database's  performance. Prepared statements are also useful because some types of values, such as  BLOBs, objects, collections, REFs, etc., are not representable as SQL text. To support this added  functionality, you use a question mark as a placeholder within the text of a SQL statement for  values that you wish to specify when you execute that statement. You can then replace that  question mark with an appropriate value using one of the many available setXXX    accessor  methods. setXXX    methods are available for setting every data type, just as getXXX     methods are available for getting the values for any data type from a result set.    In this chapter, we'll discuss the benefits of using a prepared statement versus a statement, how  to format SQL statements for use with a PreparedStatement object, how to use the various    setXXX    methods, String data type limitations when using a PreparedStatement object,  and batching. Let's start by discussing the pros and cons of using a prepared statement.   11.1 A Prepared Statement Versus a Statement  It's a popular belief that using a PreparedStatement object to execute a SQL statement is  faster than using a Statement object. That's because a PreparedStatement object makes  only one round trip to the database to get its data type information when it is first prepared, while  a Statement object must make an extra round trip to the database to get its metadata each time  it is executed. So the simple conclusion is that on the second and subsequent executions of a  prepared statement, it is 50% faster than a statement. However, according to my tests in  Chapter 19, due to the overhead of using a PreparedStatement object, it takes at least 65  executions before a PreparedStatement object is faster than a Statement object. For a small  number of executions, a PreparedStatement object is not faster than a Statement object.    However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't use a PreparedStatement. On the contrary, if you  use the batch capabilities of a PreparedStatement object to execute the same SQL statement  many times, it is significantly faster than a Statement object. Oracle's implementation of JDBC  implements batching only for PreparedStatement objects, not for Statement objects.    Prepared statements are less dynamic than their statement counterparts; you can build a SQL  statement dynamically at runtime, but doing so using a prepared statement requires more coding,  and the code required is fairly specific to the task. Prepared statements can, however, greatly  simplify formulating your SQL statements, because you don't have to worry about date formats,  number formats, or tick characters in strings. And prepared statements allow you to insert or  update streaming data types.    The advantages of using prepared statements are that they allow you to improve efficiency by  batching, utilize the SQL statement cache in the database to increase its efficiency, simplify your  coding, and allow you to insert or update streaming data types, which we'll cover in Chapter 12.   11.2 Formulating SQL Statements  When you write a prepared statement, you use a question mark character  ?  as a placeholder  that will later be replaced by a value you specify using a setXXX    method. These  placeholders can be used only for values that need to be specified in a SQL statement and not in  place of SQL keywords; they can't be used to implement a type of macro language. When  building SQL statements, you must abide by certain rules. For an INSERT statement, you can  use placeholders only in the VALUES list. For example:   insert into person_identifier_type     code, description, inactive_date     values     ?, ?, ?    In this example, the first placeholder, or question mark  ? , represents the value for the code  column; the second represents the description column, and the third represents the  inactive_date column.    For an UPDATE statement, you can use placeholders only in the SET VALUES list and in the  WHERE clause. For example:   update person_identifier_type   set    description = ?   where  code = ?    In this example, the first placeholder represents the new value for the description column,  while the second represents a value for the code column in the WHERE clause.    For a DELETE statement, you can use the placeholder only in the WHERE clause. For example:   delete person_identifier_type  where  code = ?  Finally, for a SELECT statement, you can use the placeholder in the SELECT list, WHERE  clause, GROUP BY clause, and ORDER BY clause. For example:   select ?, code, description  from   person_identifier_type  where code = ?  order by ?   Important! The question-mark placeholder used in the select  list represents a value to be supplied, not a column name.          Did you notice that in these examples, there are no ticks around placeholders that represent  character columns? That's because the PreparedStatement object takes care of properly  formatting the data. It's important for you to understand that the placeholders allow you to provide  actual values before you execute a SQL statement, and once a prepared statement is compiled   i.e., prepared , it can be executed repeatedly with different values supplied for each execution.    Now that you can properly formulate a SQL statement for a PreparedStatement, let's look at  the setXXX    methods used to set the values for the placeholders.   11.2.1 Accessor Methods  There is a setXXX    method for each of the Java data types listed in the righthand column of  Table 10-1. Of course, as with the getXXX    methods, you must use the appropriate  setXXX    method for a given SQL type.    The setXXX    methods generally have the following signature:   setdataType  int parameterIndex, dataType x   which breaks down as:  parameterIndex    The number of the placeholder in the SQL statement, counting from left to right and  starting with 1.    dataType    A class name from Table 10-1, except for data types with both a primitive data type and  a wrapper class, in which case the second parameter is the primitive data type. For  example, with setDouble   , the parameter x would be of type double.    Let's take a look at two examples. In the first, dataType is not a wrapper class. If the column  last_name in the person table is a VARCHAR2 30  and is the second parameter in a prepared  SQL statement, then an appropriate setXXX    method would be setString   :   String lastName = "O'Reilly"  pstmt.setString 2, lastName ;  In this case, the set suffix, String, and the parameter data type, String, are both the class  name, i.e., initial letter capitalized. However, if you need to update a numeric database column,    say person_id in the person table  person_id is a NUMBER , and you're using a Java long  data type, which is a primitive, then an appropriate setXXX    method would be setLong   :   long personId = 1;  pstmt.setLong 1, personId ;  This time, the set suffix, Long, is capitalized like the wrapper class name for a long. The  second parameter, however, is a long data type, the Java primitive data type. The general rule is  that you pass class types for everything except the Java primitive data types that represent  numbers; those are the primitive data types.    11.2.1.1 SQL type constants   Since JDBC acts as an interface between Java and a particular vendor's database, JDBC has a  standard set of SQL type codes that Java and JDBC drivers use to identify SQL data types.  These JDBC type codes, which are integer constants defined in the java.sql.Types class, are  used by the various PreparedStatement and CallableStatement accessor methods to  map the database's SQL data types to Java data types, and vice versa. Table 11-1 lists the  standard Oracle SQL type to Java data type mappings, and Table 11-2 lists the proprietary  Oracle SQL type to Java type mappings.    Table 11-1. Standard Oracle SQL type to Java data type mappings    Oracle SQL   data types   JDBC types   constants    java.sql.Types.    Standard Java    data types   CHAR   CHAR   java.lang.String   VARCHAR2   VARCHAR   java.lang.String   LONGVARCHAR    java.lang.String   Oracle Java   data types    oracle.sql.

The second column lists the  java.sql.Types constants that can be associated with each type. These are primarily used  with the PreparedStatement object's setObject    and with the CallableStatement  object's registerOutParameter    methods to specify data type conversions between Java  and SQL.  We'll cover the CallableStatement object's registerOutParameter    in  Chapter 13.  However, the setXXX    methods are usually self-specifying. For example, when  you use the setLong    method to set a Java long, you implicitly specify that the Java data  type long will be converted to a SQL data type NUMBER. The third column in the table lists the  corresponding Java data type for a given java.sql.Types constant. The fourth column lists the  corresponding Oracle Java data type for a given java.sql.Types constant.    Table 11-2. Proprietary Oracle SQL type to Oracle Java data type mappings    Oracle SQL   data types   Oracle types    oracle.jdbc.driver.   OracleTypes.

Accordingly, the second column lists the proprietary Oracle  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleTypes constants. The third column lists the corresponding  Java data types, and the last column lists the proprietary Oracle Java data types.    11.2.1.2 NULL values    If you wish to set a parameter in a SQL statement to NULL values, then you must use the  setNull    method with the following signature:   setNull int parameterIndex, int sqlType   which breaks down as:  parameterIndex    The position of the placeholder in the SQL statement, counting from left to right and  starting with 1    sqlType    A java.lang.Types constant, which you can find in Table 11-1    For example, here I set the middle_name column to NULL values before inserting it into the  database:   String insert =    "insert into person " +    "  person_id, last_name, first_name, " +    "middle_name, birth_date, mothers_maiden_name   " +     "values " +    "  ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?  ";  try {    pstmt = conn.prepareStatement insert ;    pstmt.setLong 1, 999999999 ;    pstmt.setString 2, "Krishnamurti" ;     pstmt.setString 3, "Jiddu" ;    pstmt.setNull 4, Types.VARCHAR ;    pstmt.setDate 5, Date.valueOf "1895-05-12"  ;    pstmt.setString 6, "Unknown" ;    rows = pstmt.executeUpdate    ;  }  11.2.1.3 Dynamic input   Dynamic input refers to formulating and preparing a SQL statement at runtime. Because you  don't know the SQL statement when you write your code, you don't know how many parameters it  will have, nor do you know their types. Consequently, you don't know which, or how many,  setXXX    methods to use, and you need a more general method for setting parameter values.  In such a case, you can use the setObject    method, which works with the default mappings  shown in Tables Table 11-1 and Table 11-2. setObject    has the following three  overloaded signatures:   setObject    int parameterIndex,    Object x     setObject    int parameterIndex,    Object x,    int targetSqlType     setObject    int parameterIndex,   Object x,   int targetSqlType,   int scale     The number of the placeholder in the SQL statement, counting from left to right and  starting with 1    which break down as:  parameterIndex    Object    targetSqlType    scale    A Java object reference   A java.lang.Types constant   The number of digits to the right of the decimal point for numeric SQL data types    All three methods can throw a SQLException. The first form of setObject    assumes the  standard mappings shown in Tables Table 11-1 and Table 11-2. With the second form of  setObject   , use a java.lang.Types constant to specify the SQL type of the parameter  you are setting. The third form of setObject    is designed for use with numeric input and  enables you to truncate the number of significant digits to the right of the decimal point. For the  most part, you'll need only the first form. Here's my earlier example rewritten to use setObject    :   String insert =    "insert into person " +    "  person_id, last_name, first_name, " +    "middle_name, birth_date, mothers_maiden_name   " +     "values " +    "  ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?  ";  try {    pstmt = conn.prepareStatement insert ;    pstmt.setObject 1, new Long 999999999  ;    pstmt.setObject 2, "Krishnamurti" ;     pstmt.setObject 3, "Jiddu" ;    pstmt.setNull 4, Types.VARCHAR ;    pstmt.setObject 5, Date.valueOf "1895-05-12"  ;    pstmt.setObject 6, "Unknown" ;    rows = pstmt.executeUpdate    ;  }  In this case, because I used setObject   , the driver must take an extra step to determine the  data type being passed to it. Consequently, it's more efficient to use the specific setXXX     methods whenever possible. Notice how I used new Long 999999999  to specify a value for  the person_id column. I did this because you can't pass a Java primitive when using the  setObject    methods. Instead, you need to use a wrapper class around the Java primitive  numeric data types  also called integrals in the JDK API documentation .    11.2.1.4 Dynamic input using the Oracle data types   If you wish to work with the Oracle data types in oracle.sql.*, then you need to cast your  PreparedStatement object to an OraclePreparedStatement object and use its  setOracleObject    method:   String            insert =    "insert into person " +    "  person_id, last_name, first_name, " +    "middle_name, birth_date, mothers_maiden_name   " +     "values " +      "  ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?  ";  try {    pstmt = conn.prepareStatement insert ;        OraclePreparedStatement pstmt .setOracleObject      1, new NUMBER 999999999  ;        OraclePreparedStatement pstmt .setOracleObject      2, new CHAR "Krishnamurti", CHAR.DEFAULT_CHARSET  ;         OraclePreparedStatement pstmt .setOracleObject      3, new CHAR "Jiddu", CHAR.DEFAULT_CHARSET  ;        OraclePreparedStatement pstmt .setNull      4, Types.VARCHAR ;        OraclePreparedStatement pstmt .setOracleObject      5, new DATE Date.valueOf "1895-01-01"   ;        OraclePreparedStatement pstmt .setOracleObject      6, new CHAR "Unknown", CHAR.DEFAULT_CHARSET  ;      rows =   OraclePreparedStatement pstmt .executeUpdate    ;   }  11.2.1.5 Fixed-length CHAR columns   There is one proprietary setXXX    method you need to be aware of. It is the  OraclePreparedStatement object's setFixedCHAR   . You need to use this if the column  you are setting in a WHERE clause is an Oracle CHAR data type, which is fixed-length and right- padded with spaces. setFixedCHAR    sets the column's value and adds any right padding as  necessary. To use it, you need to cast your PreparedStatement object to an  OraclePreparedStatement object, as in the following example:   PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement    ;     OraclePreparedStatement pstmt .setFixedCHAR 1, code ;   Of course, as I have already stated several times in this book, I would never use a CHAR  database type.    11.2.1.6 A prepared statement example   Example 11-1 demonstrates the use of placeholders and the setXXX    methods for all four  types of DML statements.

It  then executes its process    method. The process    method first creates a  PreparedStatement object for an INSERT statement by calling the Connection object's  prepareStatement    method. The program then makes three setXXX    method calls  using the resulting PreparedStatement object:    1.  The setString    method is invoked twice to set the code and description column   values.    2.  The setNull    method is invoked to set inactive_date to NULL values.    Once values have been supplied for all the placeholders, the prepared statement is executed  using its executeUpdate    method. This method reports the number of rows affected, and the  program echoes that number to the screen. The program goes on to perform similar tasks using  an UPDATE, a SELECT, and finally, a DELETE statement.   11.2.2 Limits  When using the setBytes    or setString    methods, there are limits to the amount of  data you can specify for a placeholder without using a large data type such as a BFILE, BLOB,  CLOB, LONG RAW, or LONG. Table 11-3 lists these size limitations.    Table 11-3. Size limitations for binary and character data    Database   Binary data   setBytes      Character data   setString      Oracle7   Oracle8   Oracle8i   255 bytes   2,000 bytes   2,000 bytes   2,000 bytes   4,000 bytes   4,000 bytes   Notice that Table 11-3 specifies the size limitations in terms of bytes, not characters. If you use  a multibyte character set, the maximum number of characters you can pass to setString    is  affected by the number of bytes required for each character. Assuming three bytes per character,  which some character sets require, 4,000 bytes would allow you room for only 1,333 characters.  Getting around these limitations is why the large, streaming data types exist, and they are the  subject of our next chapter.     11.2.3 Defining Parameter Types  Oracle has a proprietary method, defineParameterType   , which is similar to the  defineColumnType    method for SELECT statements  defineColumnType    is covered  in Chapter 9 . The defineParameterType    method can be used to optimize memory  consumption by reducing the size of the temporary buffers allocated to hold the values passed by  the setXXX    methods before binding them to a SQL statement. The defineParamterType     method has the following signature:   defineParameterType    int parameterIndex,   int type,   int maximumSize   which breaks down as:  parameterIndex    The number of the parameter or placeholder in the SQL statement, counting from left to  right and starting with 1    type    maximumSize    One of the java.sql.Types or oracle.sql.OracleTypes constants    The maximum size in bytes of the passed value   You can use the defineParameterType    method to reduce the default buffer size for a  String from 4 KB to a smaller number of bytes if that is all that is needed. This reduces the  amount of memory consumed for JDBC driver buffers. You must call this method after you create  the PreparedStatement and before you call any of the setXXX    methods. Example 11-2  uses defineParameterType    to specify buffer sizes of 30 and 80 bytes for the code and  description columns, respectively.    Example 11-2.

It then defines the parameter types for the code and description columns,  reducing the buffer size for those columns to match the maximum size of each column as  specified in the person_identifier_type table definition. Next, the program calls the  appropriate setXXX    methods to set values for those columns, and the  PreparedStatement is executed. This basic process is then repeated for a DELETE  statement. Note that, unlike its counterpart defineColumnType   , the  defineParameterType    method does not have to be called for every parameter in a SQL  statement.    Now that you know how to conserve memory during your inserts, updates, and deletes, let's take  a look at how to conserve network bandwidth and improve response time by taking advantage of  JDBC's batching features.   11.3 Batching  Batching allows you to gather multiple SQL statements for the same PreparedStatement into  a batch. The statements in that batch are in turn sent to the database together instead of sent  one statement at a time. This reduces the consumption of network bandwidth by eliminating the  overhead of redundant packet headers in small packets. Instead, the statements are transmitted  in one or more larger packets. Batching also eliminates the extra data required by Oracle to  packetize and unpacketize the sent data.    There are two forms of batching available: the JDBC 2.0 standard model and the Oracle  proprietary model. You'll want to use the standard implementation if you are concerned with  portability, and use Oracle's implementation if you want to get the best performance, but you  cannot mix the two batching formats. If you do, you'll get a SQLException.       Oracle supports batching only for prepared statements.  Although it does provide the methods for batching statements  and callable statements, it does not actually support batching  for them. So if you want to receive any benefit from batching,  you must use prepared statements.       11.3.1 Standard Batching Implementation  Taking a look at the big picture, standard batching works as follows. First, you turn off auto- commit and create a prepared statement. Next, you set column values as necessary. Then,  instead of calling the executeUpdate    method to send the SQL statement to the database  immediately, call the addBatch    method to add a SQL statement to a batch. Repeat the    process of setting values and adding to a batch until you are ready to send the SQL statements to  the database. Then, when you are ready to send batched SQL statements to the database, call  the executeBatch    method. The executeBatch    method in turn sends the SQL  statements in the batch to the database all at once. Finally, commit your database changes by  calling Connection.commit   . Let's start our lesson on batching by looking at adding a SQL  statement to a batch in more detail.    11.3.1.1 Adding rows to a batch   With the standard JDBC 2.0 implementation, you'll use two methods to implement batching. The  first, addBatch   , adds a SQL statement to a batch. It has the following signature:   void addBatch       All the batching methods can throw a SQLException.         To "execute" a statement, call the PreparedStatement object's addBatch    method instead  of the executeUpdate    method. This will add your prepared statement to a batch of SQL  statements, which will then be sent to the database for processing when you call the second  method, executeBatch   .   11.3.1.2 Executing a batch   The second method, executeBatch   , sends any batched SQL statements to the database  for execution all at once. It has the following signature:   int[] executeBatch      Call the executeBatch    method when you are ready to send your batched SQL statements  to the database for processing. The int array returned by executeBatch   , sometimes  referred to as the updates array, contains the number of rows affected by each statement  executed as part of the batch. Unfortunately, for prepared statements, it is not possible to know  the number of rows affected by each statement, so you'll get only a value of -2 for each  successful operation. You can also use the getUpdateCounts    method to retrieve the array  of update counts for the most recently executed batch. If an error occurs during the execution of a  batch, a BatchUpdateException is generated. If you examine the updates array while in a  BatchUpdateException, all elements will have a value of -3, which means, not surprisingly,  that there was a batch execution error. In such a situation, you should probably roll back your  transaction, but that is a matter of application design, not an absolute recommendation on my  part. One final point: it is more efficient if you call the executeBatch    method after a  specified number of adds, rather than when all rows are batched. I recommend doing so after 5- 30 operations.    11.3.1.3 Canceling a batch   If you wish to discard your batched SQL statements, call the clearBatch    method, which  has the following signature:   void clearBatch          You must call either executeBatch    or clearBatch     before calling the executeUpdate    method or you'll get a  SQLException.        11.3.1.4 Dependencies   Although Oracle's documentation states that the SQL statements in a batch are processed in the  order in which they are added to the batch, discussion on the Oracle Technology Network's JDBC  forum suggests otherwise. So, if your inserts are dependent on each other  that is, they must be  executed in the order that you insert them, as would be the case with a table that references  itself , then you won't be able to batch them.    You should also turn off auto-commit if you wish to get the best performance from batching.  Otherwise, the database will commit after each batch execution. Remember that you must  commit your batch by calling the Connection object's commit    method after you call the  executeBatch    method.       If either of the two batching models encounters a large data  type such as BFILE, BLOB, LONG RAW, CLOB, or LONG,  batching is disabled.       11.3.1.5 A standard batching example   Example 11-3 demonstrates the use of standard batching. Briefly, the program has five try  blocks. The first turns off auto-commit. The second inserts the number of rows specified by the  first command-line argument to the program, using a Statement object. The third does the  same, this time using a PreparedStatement object, but does not use any batching features.  The fourth try block uses JDBC 2.0 standard batching. Instead of calling executeUpdate   ,  each INSERT statement is added to the batch by a call to the addBatch    method. Then, after  all rows are added to the batch but not yet inserted into the database, the batch is sent to the  database by a call to the executeBatch    method. Finally, the fifth try block deletes the  rows from the table to allow another invocation to start with an empty table.    Example 11-3.

Compile the program and run  it the first time specifying a command-line parameter of 1. Then try the program again using  values of 2, 10, 20, 30, 100, and 1,000. You'll notice that for a small number of inserts, say 1-5,  the Statement object is faster than the PreparedStatement object, unbatched or batched.  But when the number of inserts is six or greater, the batched PreparedStatement is always  faster by as much as 30%.    The increase in performance that you get from batching varies depending on the type and size of  the SQL statement in question, as well as on the network connection you're using.    Now that you have an understanding of standard batching, let's look at Oracle's proprietary  solution.   11.3.2 Oracle's Batching Implementation  Oracle's proprietary batching works as follows. First, as you did with standard batching, turn off  auto-commit and create a prepared statement. Next, set an execute batch size using one of three  methods I'll cover shortly. This batch size is used by Oracle batching to determine when to send a  batch to the database. When the number of batched SQL statements reaches the specified batch  size, the Oracle driver automatically sends the SQL statements to the database. So instead of  calling the executeBatch    method at an appropriate interval, the driver takes care of  sending SQL statements for you. Now all you have to do is set the column values using the  appropriate setXXX    methods and then call the executeUpdate    method, as you would  do normally.    To enable Oracle batching, set the Oracle prepared statement's executeBatch value to a value  greater than 1  the default executeBatch value . To do so, use one of three methods:       Make a call to the OracleConnection object's setDefaultExecuteBatch   .      Specify a defaultExecuteBatch property in a Properties object passed to the   Connection object's getConnection    method.       Use the PreparedStatement object's setExecuteBatch    method to specify a   batch size for a specific statement.    The first two methods set a default batch size for all statements created by a connection. The  third method sets a batch size for a specific statement.    11.3.2.1 Setting a default batch size for a connection   You can set the default batch size for all statements created by a connection by casting your  Connection object to an OracleConnection object, then calling its setDefault- ExecuteBatch    method to set the defaultBatchValue in the OracleConnection  object. Then, any subsequent calls to the prepareStatement    method for that connection  will result in PreparedStatement objects with the batch size you specified as the default. The  setDefaultExecutionBatch    method has the following signature:   void setDefaultExecuteBatch int batchSize   The batchSize parameter represents the number of executeUpdate    invocations that will  take place before the batch is automatically sent to the database. This is where the two batching  implementations differ: Oracle batching takes place at regularly specified intervals instead of all at  once, and it's not necessary to manually execute a batch through an invocation of the  executeBatch    method. The following example shows the default batch size set to 30:       OracleConnection conn .setDefaultExecuteBatch 30 ;   Another method for setting the default batch size for a connection is to set the property  defaultExecuteBatch in a Properties object that you pass to the getConnection     method. For example:   Properties info = new Properties    ;  info.put  "user", "scott"  ;  info.put  "password", "tiger"  ;  info.put  "defaultExecuteBatch", "30"  ;    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection     "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", info  ;  However, you set the default value; doing so for a Connection object affects all subsequent  PreparedStatement objects.   11.3.2.2 Setting a batch size for a specific statement   If you want to set a different batch size for each prepared statement, cast your  PreparedStatement object to an OraclePreparedStatement object, then call its set- ExecuteBatch    method. The setExecuteBatch    method has the following signature:   void setExecuteBatch int batchSize   For example, to set the batch size for a PreparedStatement to 30:     OraclePreparedStatement pstmt .setExecuteBatch 30 ;   11.3.2.3 Forcing batch execution   You can force an OraclePreparedStatement to send its current batch to the database by  calling the sendBatch    method. This method has the following signature:   int sendBatch      Whenever you call the sendBatch    method, it returns the total number of rows affected by all  the batched SQL statements. Likewise, when you call executeUpdate   , and it in turn causes  a batch to be sent to the database, it also returns the total number of rows affected by all the  batched SQL statements. If, on the other hand, a call to executeUpdate    does not trigger  the sending of the batch, then no rows are affected, and accordingly, the method will return zero.    It's not necessary, however, to call sendBatch    at all, because this is done automatically any  time there is a call to the Connection or PreparedStatement object's close    method or  to the Connection object's commit    method.   11.3.2.4 An Oracle batching example   Example 11-4 demonstrates Oracle batching. Briefly, our second batch test program,  TestOracleBatching, is almost exactly like its standard batching counterpart, but with the  following changes:       There is an additional import statement: import oracle.jdbc.driver.*, to   support the Oracle objects.        In its fourth try block, the program starts by turning on Oracle batching with a call to the  OraclePreparedStatement object's setExecuteBatch    method, passing it an  appropriate value from 1 to 30.        Most notably, the example simply uses the standard executeUpdate    method to add   statements to the batch transparently. When the executeBatch value is reached, the  SQL statements are automatically sent to the database.    Example 11-4.

Now that you've seen both implementations at work, let's move on to our last topic in this chapter,  a summary of the relationship between PreparedStatement and  OraclePreparedStatement.   11.4 PreparedStatement Is an OraclePreparedStatement  The PreparedStatement object is an interface, java.sql.PreparedStatement,  implemented by the oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement class that extends  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement. This means that all of the proprietary methods  available in OracleStatement are also available in OraclePreparedStatement. The  following are the proprietary methods for an OraclePreparedStatement, all of which can  throw a SQLException:   defineParameterType int param_index, int type, int max_size    int getExecuteBatch      int sendBatch      setARRAY int paramIndex, ARRAY arr     setBFILE int paramIndex, BFILE file   setBfile int paramIndex, BFILE file   setBLOB int paramIndex, BLOB lob   setCHAR int paramIndex, CHAR ch   setCLOB int paramIndex, CLOB lob   setCursor int paramIndex, ResultSet rs   setCustomDatum int paramIndex, CustomDatum x   setDATE int paramIndex, DATE date   setExecuteBatch int batchValue   setFixedCHAR int paramIndex, String x   setNUMBER int paramIndex, NUMBER num   setOracleObject int paramIndex, Datum x   setRAW int paramIndex, RAW raw   setREF int paramIndex, REF ref   setRefType int paramIndex, REF ref   setROWID int paramIndex, ROWID rowid   setSTRUCT int paramIndex, STRUCT struct   Now that you have an understanding of how to use a PreparedStatement, we can move on to  the next chapter on streaming data types.   Chapter 12. Streaming Data Types  Most of the time, the 4,000 bytes of storage available with the VARCHAR2 data type under  Oracle8 and higher is sufficient for application needs. But occasionally, applications require larger  text fields or need to store complex binary data types such as word processing files and photo  images in the database. Oracle8's solution to the problem of storing large amounts of data is the  binary file  BFILE , binary large object  BLOB , and character large object  CLOB  data types.  These large object  LOB  data types ease the storage restriction to 4 GB. The difference between  a CLOB and a BLOB is that a CLOB is subject to character set translation as part of Oracle's  National Language Support  NLS , whereas a BLOB's data is taken verbatim.    Oracle7's solution to the problem of storing large amounts of data is the LONG and LONG RAW  data types. A LONG column can hold up to 2 GB of character data, while a LONG RAW can hold  up to 2 GB of binary data. However, the truth of the matter is that LONGs exist in Oracle8 and  higher only for the purpose of backward compatibility.    I recommend you use the BLOB and CLOB data types for all new development when you need to  store more than 4,000 bytes of data for a column. Collectively, LOBs are normally transferred  between your application and the database using streams instead of the get set accessor  methods used for VARCHAR2 and other types. Consequently, LOBs are also referred to as  streaming data types.    Throughout this chapter I will refer to large objects, that is  both BLOBs and CLOBs, as LOBs. When I use the term LOB,  I'm referring to a concept that applies to both types.          There are differences in the way that the two client-side drivers, the OCI driver and the Thin  driver, actually manipulate LOB data. The OCI driver uses native code in the driver, while the  Thin driver uses Oracle's built-in DBMS_LOB package. From your perspective, this difference is  apparent only when an attempt is made to use the PreparedStatement interface's methods to  write LOB data. A PreparedStatement can write LOB data only when the OCI driver is used.  I'll mention this again when it's applicable.     You may be wondering why there is such a thing as a streaming data type. Why the need for  streams? The answer is that when writing large objects, streams are more efficient than the  setXXX    methods. There's quite a bit of hearsay about the efficiency of using LOBs. It's  common to hear someone say: "Using LOBs is really slow!" The truth of the matter is that for all  practical purposes, byte-for-byte, using a large object data type is no slower than writing data to a  VARCHAR2. What some folks forget is that writing 1 MB of data takes longer than writing 2 KB. If  you need to store large objects in a database, then LOBs are the data types of choice.    In this chapter, we'll cover the use of both the streaming methods and the get set accessor  methods for inserting, updating, and selecting the large object, streaming data types. We'll start  with a detailed explanation of Oracle8's BLOB data type and then move on to cover the  differences involved when using a CLOB. Next, we'll cover the Oracle proprietary type BFILE.  Finally, we'll briefly discuss the use of LONG and LONG RAW. Let's begin our journey with a look  at binary large objects.   12.1 BLOBs  BLOBs can be used to store any type of information you desire, as long as the data is less than 4  GB. Unlike the other data types we have covered so far in this book, BLOB data is accessed  using a locator stored in a table. This locator points to the actual data. Since the locator is an  internal database pointer, you can't create a locator in your application. Instead, you must create  a BLOB locator by either inserting a new row into your database or updating an existing row.  Once you create a locator, you then retrieve it using SELECT FOR UPDATE to establish a lock  on it.    When a BLOB locator is retrieved from the database, an instance of the java.sql.Blob, or  oracle.sql.BLOB, class is used to hold the locator in your Java program. These classes hold  the BLOB locator, not the actual data. To get the actual data, you must use one of the Blob, or  BLOB, methods to read the data from the database as a stream or to get the data into a byte  array.    While the Blob interface supports getting BLOB data from the database, it does not define any  methods for inserting or updating that data. Insert and update functionality is JDBC driver- specific. I hope that this inconsistent behavior in the interface for LOBs -- of using methods from  the locator to get data but not having any defined for storing it -- will be corrected in the next  version of JDBC. For now, you can use Oracle's proprietary methods to write the contents as a  stream, or you can use a set accessor method to set the data as a byte array.    The JDBC 2.0 specification states that the PreparedStatement object's setObject    and  setBinaryStream    methods may be used to set a BLOB's value, thus bypassing the  locator. However, this functionality is currently supported only by Version 8.1.6 of the OCI driver  to an 8.1.6 database. In this chapter, I'll first show you how to use oracle.sql.BLOB to  manipulate BLOBs. This approach works for either driver. Then I'll show you how to use  java.sql.PreparedStatement, which is supported only by the OCI driver.    Let's take a moment to clarify some nomenclature. Since I'm an object-oriented programmer, I  believe that using the same name for something in different contexts is a great idea. It helps to  autodocument the subject. At the same time, however, it can cause some confusion, as it does  when discussing LOBs. For example, in this section, the word "blob" has three definitions:   BLOB    Refers to the SQL data type for a binary large object    BLOB    Refers to the oracle.sql.BLOB class used to hold a BLOB's locator in your Java  program     Blob    Refers to the java.sql.Blob interface, which is implemented by the  oracle.sql.BLOB class and is used to hold a BLOB's locator in your Java program    Please keep these distinctions in mind as you read through this section, or you may become  hopelessly confused. Before we get into an explanation of how to manipulate BLOBs, we first  need a table with a BLOB column in it for our examples. So let's proceed by creating a LOB table.   12.1.1 An Example LOB Table  Before you can insert a BLOB, you must have a table containing a BLOB column. For our  examples, we'll expand our HR database with a person_information table. In this table, we'll  use person_id as a primary key and as a foreign key that references the person table, a  biography column defined as a CLOB to hold a person's biographical information, and a photo  column defined as a BLOB to hold a picture of the person in question. The following is the DDL  for our person_information table:   drop   table PERSON_INFORMATION     create table PERSON_INFORMATION    person_id  number  not null,  biography  clob,  photo      blob    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0      alter  table PERSON_INFORMATION add   constraint   PERSON_INFORMATION_PK  primary key   person_id    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10 K next 10 K pctincrease 0      Now that we have a table for our examples, we can continue by looking at how you insert a  BLOB.   12.1.2 Inserting a BLOB Using oracle.sql.BLOB  In earlier chapters, when we discussed how to insert, update, delete, and select a DATE,  NUMBER, or VARCHAR2 data type, it was simply a matter of providing a character  representation of the data for a Statement object, or using a setXXX    method with a  PreparedStatement object, and then executing the SQL statement. However, with LOBs, this  one-step process does not work. Instead, when working with a LOB you need a three-step  process. That's because with a LOB, a locator object, not the actual data, is stored in a table's  column. You need to retrieve the locator to insert or update the actual LOB data. The three-step  process is:    1.  Create a locator by inserting a row into a table.   2.  Retrieve the locator from the inserted row using a SELECT statement with the FOR   UPDATE clause to manually lock the row.    3.  Use the locator to insert the BLOB data into the database.    12.1.2.1 Creating a locator    A locator is an object that points to the actual location of the BLOB data in the database. You  need a locator to manipulate the BLOB data. Because it points to a location in the database  address space, only the database can create a new locator. Therefore, your Java program cannot  create a locator. I know that last sentence is redundant, but it's very important that you realize up  front that creating a locator is solely the job of the database.    To create a new locator for a BLOB, use the empty_blob    database function to generate the  BLOB column's value in an INSERT statement. For example, to insert a new row into the  person_information table and at the same time create a new BLOB locator, use the  empty_blob    database function:   insert into person_information            person_id, photo            values   1,         empty_blob        In this example, the number 1 is passed as the person_id value, and the result of the  empty_blob    function is passed as the photo value. When this statement is executed, the  database creates a new locator for the person_information table's photo column and stores  that locator in the row being inserted. Initially, the locator points to a location that contains no  data, for you have not yet used the locator to store any data. If you don't use the empty_blob     database function to generate a locator, you'll get a null reference error when you later  attempt to retrieve the locator to insert your BLOB data.    Now that you know how to create a locator, let's look at how to retrieve that locator from the  database.    12.1.2.2 Retrieving a locator   To retrieve a locator, you must execute a SELECT statement for the BLOB column using either a  Statement or PreparedStatement object. You must include the FOR UPDATE clause, or the  FOR UPDATE NOWAIT clause, in the SELECT statement to lock the locator; the locator must be  manually locked for you to use it to insert or update BLOB data. For example, to retrieve and lock  the locator inserted earlier, use the following SQL statement:   select photo  from   person_information  where  person_id = 1  for update nowait  In your Java program, you get the locator value from a ResultSet object using the getBlob     accessor method. Alternatively, you can call the OracleResultSet object's getBLOB     accessor method. The locator is then assigned to an oracle.sql.BLOB object in your program.  If you use the ResultSet.getBlob    method, you'll have to cast the returned  java.sql.Blob object to an oracle.sql.BLOB object. For example, you'll use code similar to  the following:   ResultSet rslt = stmt.executeQuery    "select photo " +   "from   person_information " +   "where  person_id = 1 " +    "for update nowait" ;  rslt.next    ;  oracle.sql.BLOB photo =  oracle.sql.BLOB rslt.getBlob 1 ;   Now that you know how to retrieve a locator, let's see how you can use it to actually insert some  BLOB data.    12.1.2.3 Using the locator to insert BLOB data    Once you've retrieved a valid BLOB locator from the database, you can use it to insert binary  data into the database. First, you need to get a binary output stream from the BLOB object using  the getBinaryOutputStream    method, which has the following signature:   OutputStream getBinaryOutputStream      Next, you need to get the optimal buffer size when writing the binary data to the database by  calling the BLOB object's getBufferSize    method, which has the following signature:   int getBufferSize       You can use the optimal buffer size to allocate a byte array to act as a buffer when you write  binary data using the BLOB object's OutputStream object. At this point, all that's left to do is use  the output stream's write    method to write the binary data to the database. The  OutputStream object's write    method has the following signature:   write byte[] buffer, int offset, int length   which breaks down as:  buffer    A byte array containing the BLOB data you desire to write to the database BLOB column    offset    length    The offset from the beginning of the array to the point from which you wish to begin  writing data    The number of bytes to write to the BLOB column   After you're done writing the data, you'll need to call the OutputStream object's close     method, or your written data will be lost. For example, given that you have someone's picture in a  .gif file, and you want to load it into the database using the locator photo that we created earlier,  you'll use code such as the following:   try {       Open a gif file for reading    File binaryFile = new File "picture.gif" ;    in = new FileInputStream binaryFile ;         Get the BLOB's output stream    out = photo.getBinaryOutputStream    ;         Get the optimal buffer size from the BLOB    int optimalSize = photo.getBufferSize    ;         Allocate an optimal buffer    byte[] buffer = new byte[optimalSize];         Read the file input stream, in, and        write it to the the output stream, out       When length = -1, there's no more to read    int length = 0;    while   length = fin.read buffer   != -1  {      out.write buffer, 0, length ;    }         You need to close the output stream before       you commit, or the changes are lost!     out.close    ;        out = null;    fin.close    ;    fin = null;    conn.commit    ;  }  12.1.2.4 An example that inserts a BLOB using an output stream   Example 12-1 shows a complete, fully functional program that uses the BLOB object's  getBinaryOutputStream    method to insert a .gif file into the person_information table  using an output stream.

The program starts in its main    method by instantiating itself and then  executes its process    method. The process    method begins by allocating the following  variables:   rows    An int value to hold the number of rows retrieved by a SELECT statement    fin    A FileInputStream used to read a file from the filesystem     out    rslt    stmt    photo    person_id    An OutputStream object used to write the BLOB data into the database    A ResultSet object used to retrieve a BLOB locator from the database    A Statement object used to retrieve a BLOB locator from the database and to execute  an INSERT statement to create that locator in the first place    A BLOB object to hold a valid locator from the database   A long to hold the primary key for a person row from the person table    Next, the program enters a try block where it starts by turning off auto-commit. It then executes  a SELECT statement against the person table to get the primary key value for Tim O'Reilly. If the  program finds Tim O'Reilly in the person table, it continues by executing a SELECT statement  that retrieves and locks the photo column locator for Tim. In the while loop for this SELECT  statement, I use the java.sql.ResultSet object's getBlob    method to retrieve the locator  from the result set. Since this method returns a java.sql.Blob, I cast it to an  oracle.sql.BLOB in order to assign it to the photo variable.    If the program doesn't find an existing entry for Tim in the person_information table, it  proceeds by inserting a new row and uses the empty_blob    database function in the  INSERT statement to create a new locator. The program then retrieves that newly inserted  locator with a lock. In the while loop for this SELECT statement, I take a different approach to  the casting problem. Instead of casting the object returned from getBlob    to an  oracle.sql.BLOB, I cast the ResultSet object, rslt, to an OracleResultSet object and  call the OracleResultSet object's getBLOB    method.    At this point in the program, photo is a valid locator that can be used to insert BLOB data into the  database. The program proceeds by creating a File object for a file named tim.gif. It uses the  File object as an argument to the constructor of a FileInputStream object. This opens the  tim.gif file in the local filesystem for reading. Next, the program creates a byte array to act as a  buffer, passing to its constructor the optimal buffer size by calling the getBufferSize     method of the BLOB object, photo. Now the program has an input stream and an output stream.  It enters a while loop where the contents of the input stream are read and then written to the  database. The while loop contains the following elements:   fin.read buffer     Reads as many bytes of data from the input stream as will fit into the byte array named  buffer.    length = fin.read buffer      length = fin.read buffer      Stores the number of bytes actually read into the variable length. The read    method  of the input stream returns the number of bytes that are actually read as an int.    Evaluates to the actual number of bytes read, so that value can be used in the while  loop's conditional statement.   while   length = fin.read buffer   != -1      The conditional phrase for the while loop. When the end of the file is reached for the  input stream, the read    method returns a value of -1, which ultimately ends the  while loop.    out.write buffer, 0, length     Calls the OutputStream object's write    method, passing it the byte array   buffer , the starting position in the array from which to write data  always 0 , and the  number of bytes to write. This one statement is the body of the while loop. The write     method reads data from the buffer and writes it to the database.    After writing the data to the database using an output stream, effectively inserting the data, the  program continues by closing the output stream with a call to its close    method. This is a  critical step. If you don't close the stream, the data is lost. Also, the output stream must be closed  before you commit or, again, the data will be lost. The program finishes up by closing the input  stream and committing the data.    Example 12-1 has highlighted a very important point about LOBs. LOB data is streamed to the  database in chunks rather than sent all at once. This is done for two reasons. First, the amount of  memory consumed by a program is conserved. Without streaming, if you had a .jpeg file that was  1 GB, you'd need to consume at least 1 GB of memory to load the .jpeg file's data into memory.  With streaming, you can read reasonably small chunks of data into memory. Second, it prevents  your data transmission from monopolizing the network's available bandwidth. If you sent 1 GB of  data in one transmission to the database, everyone else's transmission would have to wait until  yours was finished. This might cause network users to think there was something wrong with the  network. By streaming the data in chunks, you release access of the network to other users  between each chunk.    12.1.2.5 A nonstreaming alternative for small BLOBs   It's an oxymoron: small binary large objects. But there is nothing to prevent you from using  BLOBs to store small amounts of binary data in the database. If your binary data is always under  4,000 bytes, then you might consider using the oracle.sql.BLOB object's putBytes     method to send the data to the database. The putBytes    method works in a manner similar  to the setXXX    accessor methods and has the following signature:   int putBytes long position, byte[] bytes   which breaks down as:  position    The starting position, in bytes, within the BLOB in the database. Data is written into the  BLOB starting from this point.    bytes    putBytes    A byte array that contains the data to write to the BLOB in the database.    Returns an int value with the number of bytes actually written to the BLOB.    The putBytes    method is actually one of several methods that allow you to directly modify a  BLOB in the database. In this chapter, I show you how to use it to insert a BLOB value as one  chunk of data.    12.1.2.6 An example that inserts a BLOB using the putBytes    method    Example 12-2 inserts a new row into the database, creating a new, empty locator at the same  time. In then uses the empty locator stored in the oracle.sql.BLOB object and that BLOB  object's putBytes    method to update the BLOB.   Example 12-2. Using putBytes    to insert a BLOB   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.text.*;    public class TestBLOBPutBytes {    Connection conn;      public TestBLOBPutBytes     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      new TestBLOBPutBytes  .process    ;    }      public void process     throws IOException, SQLException {      int               rows      = 0;      FileInputStream   fin       = null;      ResultSet         rslt      = null;      Statement         stmt      = null;      Blob              photo     = null;      long              person_id = 0;        try {        conn.setAutoCommit false ;             Get Tim's person_id         stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select person_id " +          "from   person " +          "where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly' " +          "and    first_name = 'Tim'" ;           while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          person_id = rslt.getLong 1 ;        }        if  rows > 1  {          System.err.println "Too many rows!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }          else if  rows == 0  {          System.err.println "Not found!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        rslt.close    ;        rslt = null;                   check to see if the row already exists        rows = 0;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select photo " +         "from   person_information " +         "where  person_id = " + Long.toString  person_id   + " " +          "for update nowait" ;        while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          photo = rslt.getBlob 1 ;        }        rslt.close    ;        rslt = null;                   If it doesn't exist, then insert           a row in the information table           This creates the LOB locators        if  rows == 0  {          rows = stmt.executeUpdate            "insert into person_information " +            "  person_id, biography, photo   " +            "values " +           "  " + Long.toString  person_id   +            ", empty_clob  , empty_blob      " ;          System.out.println rows + " rows inserted" ;                          Retrieve the locator          rows = 0;          rslt = stmt.executeQuery            "select photo " +           "from   person_information " +           "where  person_id = " + Long.toString  person_id   + " " +            "for update nowait" ;          rslt.next    ;          photo = rslt.getBlob 1 ;          rslt.close    ;          rslt = null;        }        stmt.close    ;        stmt = null;             Copy the entire contents of the file to a buffer         File binaryFile = new File "tim.gif" ;        long fileLength = binaryFile.length    ;        fin = new FileInputStream binaryFile ;        byte[] buffer = new byte[ int fileLength];        fin.read buffer ;        fin.close    ;        fin = null;                  Write the buffer all at once        int bytesWritten =   oracle.sql.BLOB photo .putBytes 1, buff er ;          if  bytesWritten == fileLength            System.out.println fileLength + " bytes written" ;         else          System.out.println "only " + bytesWritten + " bytes written" ;               conn.commit    ;        }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println "SQL Error: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      catch  IOException e  {        System.err.println "IO Error: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      finally {        if  rslt != null             try { rslt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  stmt != null             try { stmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  fin != null             try { fin.close    ;  } catch  IOException  ignore  { }       }    }      protected void finalize          throws Throwable {      if  conn != null          try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       super.finalize    ;    }  }  Example 12-2, TestBLOBPutBytes, works exactly the same as Example 12-1, except for  the last section of the try block where it uses the oracle.sql.BLOB object's putBytes     method to send the data to the database as one chunk instead of as several streamed chunks.  The section starts out by creating a File object for the tim.gif file, just as in the earlier example,  but this time, since the data will be sent all at once, the program calls the File object's length     method to determine the size of the .gif file in bytes. The program then uses the file's size as an  argument to the constructor of a byte array, named buffer, to create an array large enough to  hold the entire contents of the .gif file. Next, creating a new FileInputStream object opens the  file. Then, the entire contents of the file are read into the buffer through a call to the input stream's  read    method.    Now that the program has the file in memory, it casts the photo variable from a  java.sql.Blob to an oracle.sql.BLOB and calls its putBytes    method to write the data  to the database. The first argument to the putBytes    method is 1. This is the starting position  at which to begin writing data to the database BLOB. Notice that the starting position is a 1 and  not a 0. While arrays start at 0 in Java, they start at 1 in the database. The second argument to  the method is the byte array, buffer, which contains the data to be written.    Did you notice that no SQL statement was required to update the BLOB when we used the  locator? All we needed to do was use the locator's putBytes    method.     With the BLOB data written, the program commits the changes and unlocks the row by calling the  commit    method.   12.1.3 Inserting a BLOB Using java.sql.PreparedStatement   As an alternative to using Oracle's oracle.sql.BLOB object and its getBinaryOutput- Stream    method, you can insert a BLOB using the PreparedStatement object's  setBinaryStream    method, setBytes    method, or setObject    method. Using a  PreparedStatement object even appears to bypass the process of creating and retrieving a  locator. Most likely, this part of the process actually occurs but is handled by the driver. Currently,  this approach of using PreparedStatement methods works only with the 8.1.6 OCI driver  connected to an 8.1.6 database. Let's take a look at how each of these three methods is used.  We'll begin with the streaming method, setBinaryStream   .   12.1.3.1 Using setBinaryStream    to insert a BLOB   Using the setBinaryStream    method makes inserting BLOB data into the database a one- step process. Instead of inserting a row using the empty_blob    database function to create a  locator and then retrieving that row to get the locator, you simply formulate an INSERT statement  for a PreparedStatement object and then call that object's setBinaryStream    method.  When you call the setBinaryStream    method, you pass it an input stream. You can use the  following INSERT statement, for example, to insert a BLOB into the photo column:   insert into person_information            person_id, photo     values   ?,         ?        The first placeholder's value is set using the setLong    accessor method, while the second  value is set using the setBinaryStream    method. The setBinaryStream    method has  the following signature:   setBinaryStream    int parameterIndex,    InputStream inputStream,    int length   which breaks down as:  parameterIndex    The position of the placeholder in the SQL statement, counting from left to right and  starting with 1    inputStream    length    An open InputStream object that points to the BLOB data to load into the database    The length of the binary data in bytes   You may recall that in Example 12-1 you had to code a while loop to send data from the input  stream to the database one chunk at a time. When you use the setBinaryStream    method,  the driver manages that process for you. This means you open an input stream, pass it to the  driver with a call to setBinaryStream   , and the driver takes care of all the gory details for  you. Example 12-3 demonstrates this.    Example 12-3. Using setBinaryStream    to insert a BLOB   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;    import java.text.*;    public class TestBlobSetBinaryStream {    Connection conn;      public TestBlobSetBinaryStream     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:oci8:@dssw2k01", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      new TestBlobSetBinaryStream  .process    ;    }      public void process     throws IOException, SQLException {       FileInputStream   fin       = null;      int               rows      = 0;      long              person_id = 0;      PreparedStatement pstmt     = null;      ResultSet         rslt      = null;      Statement         stmt      = null;      try {        conn.setAutoCommit false ;             Get Tim's person_id         stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select person_id " +          "from   person " +          "where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly' " +          "and    first_name = 'Tim'" ;           while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          person_id = rslt.getLong 1 ;        }        if  rows > 1  {          System.err.println "Too many rows!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        else if  rows == 0  {          System.err.println "Not found!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        rslt.close    ;        rslt = null;             Delete an existing row        rows = stmt.executeUpdate            "delete person_information " +         "where  person_id = " + Long.toString  person_id   ;           stmt.close    ;        stmt = null;             Insert the data bypassing the locator using a stream            This works only for oci8 driver 8.1.6 to database 8.1.6        pstmt = conn.prepareStatement          "insert into person_information " +          "  person_id, biography, photo   " +          "values " +         "  ?, empty_clob    , ?

After the program has created a PreparedStatement object    for the INSERT statement and a FileInputStream object for tim.gif, the program proceeds by  setting the primary key value using the setLong    method. Next, it calls the  setBinaryStream    method passing the input stream, fin, and the file's length. The  program actually writes the data to the database by calling the executeUpdate    method,  causing the JDBC driver to read data from the input stream until it reaches the specified number  of bytes. Immediately after calling executeUpdate   , the program calls the input stream's  close    method.    You must always close the input stream after the execution of  the SQL statement but before you commit to ensure that all  the data is written.          Now that you've seen how to use setBinaryStream   , which is a streaming method, let's  take a look at the first of the two nonstreaming alternatives.    12.1.3.2 Using setBytes    to insert a BLOB   Using the PreparedStatement object's setBytes    method to insert the BLOB data into the  database is very similar to using the oracle.sql.BLOB object's putBytes    method. You'll  use a prepared INSERT statement as you did with setBinaryStream   . However, this time  you need all the binary data in memory, and you call the setBytes    accessor method instead  of setBinaryStream   . The setBytes    accessor method has the following signature:   setBytes int parameterIndex, byte[] buffer   which breaks down as:  parameterIndex    The position of the placeholder in the SQL statement, counting from left to right and  starting with 1    buffer    A byte array that contains the BLOB data to be written to the database   Example 12-4 uses the PreparedStatement object's setBytes    method to insert BLOB  data into a database.    Example 12-4. Using setBytes    to insert a BLOB   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.text.*;    public class TestBlobSetBytes {    Connection conn;    public TestBlobSetBytes     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:oci8:@dssw2k01", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }      }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      new TestBlobSetBytes  .process    ;    }      public void process     throws IOException, SQLException {       int               rows      = 0;      FileInputStream   fin       = null;      ResultSet         rslt      = null;      Statement         stmt      = null;      PreparedStatement pstmt     = null;      long              person_id = 0;      try {        conn.setAutoCommit false ;             Get Tim's person_id         stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select person_id " +          "from   person " +          "where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly' " +          "and    first_name = 'Tim'" ;           while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          person_id = rslt.getLong 1 ;        }        if  rows > 1  {          System.err.println "Too many rows!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        else if  rows == 0  {          System.err.println "Not found!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        rslt.close    ;        rslt = null;                   Delete an existing row        rows = stmt.executeUpdate          "delete person_information " +         "where  person_id = " + Long.toString  person_id   ;           stmt.close    ;        stmt = null;             Read the entire file into a buffer        File binaryFile = new File "tim.gif" ;        long fileLength = binaryFile.length    ;        byte[] buffer = new byte[ int fileLength];        fin = new FileInputStream binaryFile ;        int bytes = fin.read buffer ;        fin.close    ;             Insert the data bypassing the locator           This works only for oci8 driver 8.1.6 to database 8.1.6           pstmt = conn.prepareStatement          "insert into person_information " +          "  person_id, biography, photo   " +          "values " +         "  ?, empty_clob    , ?  " ;        pstmt.setLong 1, person_id ;        pstmt.setBytes 2, buffer ;        rows = pstmt.executeUpdate    ;        System.out.println rows + " rows inserted" ;          conn.commit    ;          pstmt.close    ;        pstmt = null;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println "SQL Error: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      catch  IOException e  {        System.err.println "IO Error: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      finally {        if  rslt != null             try { rslt.close    ;  } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  stmt != null             try { stmt.close    ;  } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  pstmt != null            try { pstmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }      }    }      protected void finalize          throws Throwable {      if  conn != null          try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       super.finalize    ;    }  }  In this example, TestBlobSetBytes, the process for setting the BLOB column differs from the  streaming example, TestBlobSetBinaryStream, in two ways. First, this program reads the  entire contents of the tim.gif file into a byte array  buffer , whereas in  TestBlobSetBinaryStream, an input stream was opened for the file but was read by the  JDBC driver. Second, in this program, the value of the BLOB column is set using the setBytes     method, passing it the byte array buffer. In TestBlobSetBinaryStream, the input stream  is passed as the input argument, whereupon the driver reads the input stream, and thus the file.  While it may appear to be desirable to use the setBytes    method, I recommend you do so  only for small binary objects. The streaming methods are much more efficient. Now let's take a  look at the second, nonstreaming alternative for inserting BLOB data.    12.1.3.3 Using setObject    to insert a BLOB   You can also use the setObject    method to insert binary data into a BLOB column in the  database. We covered the setObject    method in Chapter 11, but just in case you forgot,  here's the applicable signature:   setObject int parameterIndex, Object x     which breaks down as:  parameterIndex    x    The position of the placeholder in the SQL statement, counting from left to right and  starting with 1    A Java object that you wish to insert into the database   To use this method to insert a BLOB value into the database, use the same approach as in  Example 12-4 but call setObject    instead of setBytes   . Now that you know how to  insert a BLOB value into a database, let's look at how to- update it.   12.1.4 Updating a BLOB  Updating a BLOB in the database -- in other words, replacing an entire BLOB, not modifying it in  place -- requires processes similar to those used to insert a BLOB. Once again, the process  differs depending on whether you're using an oracle.sql.BLOB object or a  PreparedStatement object. First, let's take a look at the process when using an  oracle.sql.BLOB object, which works for both the OCI and Thin drivers.   12.1.4.1 Using oracle.sql.BLOB to update a BLOB   It took three steps to insert BLOB data into the database when using an oracle.sql.BLOB  object. It takes only two steps to update a BLOB using an oracle.sql.BLOB object:    1.  Retrieve the locator from a row using the SELECT FOR UPDATE syntax to acquire a   manual lock.    2.  Use the locator to write the new BLOB data into the database.    Essentially, the process for updating a BLOB is the same as inserting a BLOB, except that you  don't need to create the locator. In an update, the locator already exists. If you take another look  at Example 12-1, you'll see that the program was actually written to update a BLOB if one  already existed; otherwise, a new BLOB was inserted. The second SELECT statement in  TestBLOBGetBinaryOutput  Example 12-1  attempted to retrieve an existing row in the  person_information table. If an existing row could be retrieved, the program skipped the  INSERT and SELECT statements that created a new row with an empty locator and proceeded  directly to updating the BLOB data using the getBinaryOutputStream    method in concert  with the input stream for file tim.gif.    Updating a BLOB using the putBytes    method is also done in much the same manner as  inserting a BLOB with putBytes   . Now let's take a look at using the PreparedStatement  object to update a BLOB value.    12.1.4.2 Using java.sql.PreparedStatement to update a BLOB   Once again, the process for updating a BLOB value using a prepared statement is much like that  for inserting a BLOB using a prepared statement. The only difference is the use of a prepared  UPDATE statement instead of an INSERT statement. For example, the following SQL statement  can be used with a PreparedStatement object to update a BLOB's value:   update person_information   set    photo = ?  where  person_id = ?    With this statement, you can use the setBinaryStream   , setBytes   , or setObject     method to set the BLOB value for the first parameter, as we did for the photo column in  Examples Example 12-3 and Example 12-4.   12.1.5 Deleting a BLOB  Deleting a BLOB is simple enough: just delete the row in which its locator resides, and the BLOB  value is deleted, too. But what if you simply want to set the BLOB value to NULL values? If you  update a BLOB column, setting it to NULL values, then you end up destroying the locator, which  is not desirable. If a Java program retrieves a BLOB column expecting to get a locator, and one  doesn't exist  because it's been set to NULL values , then a NullPointerException is thrown.  What you really want to do is get the locator to point to nothing, as it did when it was first created.  The solution to this problem is to update the BLOB column using the empty_blob    database  function:   update person_information   set    photo = empty_blob      where  person_id = ?  When this UPDATE statement is executed, a new BLOB locator will replace the existing locator,  giving you an empty BLOB, which effectively translates to "no value." This is as close as you can  get to setting a BLOB value to NULL values.   12.1.6 Selecting a BLOB  Unlike selecting other data types from a database, to get BLOB data out of the database, you  must follow a two-step process.    1.  Select a BLOB locator from a table.   2.  Use the Blob object's getBinaryStream    method, or its getBytes    method, to   access the binary data.    Just as when you insert or update a BLOB, it's more efficient when selecting a BLOB to use the  getBinaryStream    streaming method instead of the getBytes    method. Unlike  inserting and updating a BLOB, you can use only a java.sql.Blob object's methods to get the  data out; there are no methods to bypass the locator. As I stated earlier, this makes the current  implementation of the java.sql.Blob interface inconsistent, and perhaps this inconsistency  will be addressed in the next release of JDBC.    The choice of which method to use -- the streaming getBinaryStream    or nonstreaming  getBytes    method -- will ultimately be determined by your application's use of the binary data  once it is retrieved from the database. As I explained earlier when discussing Oracle's  getBinaryOutputStream    method to insert BLOB data, the use of the streaming methods  can significantly reduce the amount of memory consumed by your application and can also  reduce your application's impact on other users of the network. If you have a program that can  read and then immediately write streamed data, or that can work with chunks of binary data, not  requiring all the data to be in memory at once, then you should use the getBinaryStream     method to retrieve BLOB data.    12.1.6.1 Using getBinaryStream    to retrieve BLOB data   To get a BLOB locator from the database, you must execute a SQL SELECT statement that  includes the BLOB column. For example, to retrieve the locator for the photo column, you may  use a prepared SELECT statement such as the following:   select photo    from   person_information  where  person_id = ?  After you've retrieved the column and thus have a result set, you can use the ResultSet  object's getBlob    method to store the locator into a local variable:   java.sql.Blob photo = rslt.getBlob 1 ;  Once you have a locator, you can use it to get a binary input stream that in turn can be used to  retrieve the BLOB data from the database. The getBinaryStream    method has the  following signature:   InputStream getBinaryStream      Using the locator, you can get an input stream:  InputStream in = photo.getBinaryStream    ;  Next, use a while loop to read the input stream and write to an output stream one buffer  or  chunk  of data at a time, as shown in the following example:   int bufferSize = 1024;  byte[] buffer = new byte[bufferSize];  while   length = in.read buffer   != -1  {    out.write buffer, 0, length ;  }  There's a lot happening in this example, so let's dissect it one step at a time:   int bufferSize = 1024    This is an int variable that will be used to specify the buffer's size.    byte[] buffer = new byte[bufferSize]    This creates a byte array, buffer, to act as the buffer for streaming the data between  the input stream and the output stream. In this case, a maximum of 1,024 bytes can be  read into the buffer from the input stream and then written from the buffer to the output  stream.   in.read buffer     This reads data from the input stream into the buffer, up to the buffer's size.    length = in.read buffer      length = in.read buffer      This statement assigns the return value to the length variable for later use. The call to  the read    method returns an int value representing the actual number of bytes read.    This expression evaluates to the number of bytes read from the input stream; it evaluates  to -1 when there is no more data to read.    while   length = in.read buffer   != -1     This is the conditional statement of the while loop. If there is no more data to be read  from the input stream, the while loop ends.    out.write buffer, 0, length     This writes the data in the buffer to the output stream.   12.1.6.2 An example using getBinaryStream      Example 12-5, a servlet named TestBlobServlet, uses the java.sql.Blob object's  getBinaryStream    method to send a photo to your browser's screen. The servlet is called    passing a last name and first name using the following syntax after the servlet's name on your  browser's URL address line:   ?last_name=  last name&first_name=  first name  For example, assuming that you have a servlet container installed on your computer configured  for port 8080 and are using ojdbc as the servlet context directory, to open Tim's photo, type the  following URL in your browser:    http:  localhost:8080 ojdbc servlet TestBlobServlet?last_name=O'Reilly&first_name=Tim   Your browser will then execute the servlet, passing "Tim" for the first_name parameter and  "O'Reilly" for the last_name parameter.   Example 12-5. A servlet to view a person's photo   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class TestBlobServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet      HttpServletRequest request,      HttpServletResponse response       throws IOException, ServletException {        ServletOutputStream out = response.getOutputStream    ;        Blob       photo      = null;      Connection connection = CacheConnection.checkOut    ;       Statement  statement  = null;      ResultSet  resultSet  = null;      String     sql        =       "select photo " +       "from   person p, person_information i " +       "where  p.person_id = i.person_id " +       "and    last_name = " +         formatWithTicks request.getParameter "last_name"   + " " +        "and    first_name = " +         formatWithTicks request.getParameter "first_name"  ;        try {         statement = connection.createStatement    ;        resultSet = statement.executeQuery sql ;        if  resultSet.next      {          photo = resultSet.getBlob 1 ;        }        else {          response.setContentType "text html" ;          out.println "   Person Photo  " ;           out.println "  No data found   " ;           return;        }        response.setContentType "image gif" ;            InputStream in = photo.getBinaryStream    ;        System.out.println "after getBinaryStream" ;          int length     =  int photo.length    ;        System.out.println "lenght of the blob is " + length ;           int bufferSize = 1024;        System.out.println "buffer size is " + bufferSize ;           byte[] buffer = new byte[bufferSize];          while   length = in.read buffer   != -1  {          System.out.println "writing " + length + " bytes" ;           out.write buffer, 0, length ;        }          System.out.println "written" ;        in.close    ;        out.flush    ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.out.println "TestBlobServlet.doGet     SQLException: " +           e.getMessage     + "executing " ;        System.out.println sql ;      }      finally {        if  resultSet != null            try { resultSet.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  statement != null            try { statement.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       }         Return the conection      CacheConnection.checkIn connection ;    }      public void doPost      HttpServletRequest request,      HttpServletResponse response      throws IOException, ServletException {      doGet request, response ;    }      private String formatWithTicks String string  {      if  string != null  {        char[]       in  = string.toCharArray    ;        StringBuffer out = new StringBuffer  int  in.length * 1.1  ;         if  in.length > 0           out.append "'" ;        for  int i=0;i < in.length;i++  {          out.append in[i] ;          if  in[i] == '\''              out.append in[i] ;        }        if  in.length > 0           out.append "'" ;        return out.toString    ;        }      else {        return "NULL";      }    }  }  Using the URL shown earlier, the servlet starts in its doGet    method by creating several  variables. The first, out, is a ServletOutputStream that will be used to write the binary GIF  data to your browser. The second, photo, is a Blob to hold the photo's locator from the  database. The last four are JDBC objects you're now familiar with and will be used to retrieve the  locator from the database. Next, the program enters a try block in which it queries the database  for a photo using the parameters from the URL. After the servlet calls the executeQuery     method, it tests for the existence of a photo. If one exists, it retrieves the locator using the  ResultSet object's getBlob    method. Next, the program sends an image gif content  header. Then it gets the Blob object's input stream by calling its getBinaryStream     method. It uses this input stream to find the length of the BLOB and then executes a while loop  from which the contents of the BLOB are sent to the browser. Finally, it closes the input stream  and flushes the servlet's output stream. You can use this sample program to verify that the insert  and update programs shown earlier actually did insert BLOB data into the photo column.   12.1.7 Oracle BLOB Methods  The oracle.sql.BLOB class implements java.sql.Blob. The following are the  oracle.sql.BLOB proprietary methods, all of which can throw a SQLException:   OutputStream getBinaryOutputStream      int getBufferSize      int getBytes long pos, int length, byte buf[]    int getChunkSize      OracleConnection getConnection      boolean isConvertibleTo Class jClass   int putBytes long pos, byte bytes[]   Object toJdbc      Now that you can insert, update, delete, and select BLOBs, you have a good foundation for  understanding the character-specific implementation of a LOB, which is a character large object,  or CLOB.   12.2 CLOBs  For the most part, a CLOB behaves just like a BLOB, except it exists specifically for storing  character data and is subject to National Language Support  NLS  character conversion.  Whereas an oracle.sql.BLOB object has methods for handling binary data, an  oracle.sql.CLOB object has methods for reading and writing both ASCII and Unicode   character  data. If you use the ASCII methods -- getAsciiStream   , setAsciiStream   ,  and getAsciiOutputStream    -- the driver translates the client character set of ASCII to and  from the database's character set. If you use the character methods -- getCharacterStream    , setCharacterStream   , getCharacterOutputStream   , and putChars    -- the  driver translates the client character set of Unicode to the database's character set. The database  will handle the data as ASCII if the database character set is ASCII; otherwise, the database will  perform NLS character set translations to maintain the Unicode characters if the database uses,  for example, the UTF-8 character set.    You can just as easily store text in a BLOB, so why should you use a CLOB instead of a BLOB?  The most compelling reason to use a CLOB is its NLS abilities, that is, its abilities to handle NLS  character set conversions. And to access these, you need a database that uses a UTF-8    character set, and you need to use the character methods. The only advantage to using the  ASCII methods is that they are more efficient. However, if you code your applications with the  character methods, they will work with ASCII data in an ASCII database or with any supported  character set for a UTF-8 database.    The use of the word "clob" has three different definitions in this section, so let's take a moment  here to clarify some nomenclature:   CLOB    Refers to the SQL data type for a character large object   Refers to the oracle.sql.CLOB class used to hold a CLOB's locator in your Java  program    CLOB    Clob    Refers to the java.sql.Clob interface, which is implemented by the  oracle.sql.CLOB class and is used to hold a CLOB's locator in your Java program    As with BLOBs, CLOBs have three different classes that provide methods for manipulating the  LOB data. To write CLOB data, use the Oracle proprietary methods from class  oracle.sql.CLOB or the JDBC interface java.sql.PreparedStatement. To read CLOB  data, use methods from the standard JDBC interface java.sql.Clob.   12.2.1 Inserting a CLOB Using oracle.sql.CLOB  Let's start our discussion on inserting CLOBs by noting some significant differences in the  nomenclature between BLOBs and CLOBs. When we talk about binary data, we refer to data  units of 1 byte each. The CLOB equivalent is to talk about character data in terms of characters,  which may be 1 or more bytes in length. The ASCII CLOB methods represent an exception to this  rule: they deal with bytes. A similar nomenclature difference exists with respect to streams. To  read and write a BLOB, we use InputStream and OutputStream objects, whereas with a  CLOB, we use Reader and Writer objects. Once again, ASCII data is an exception. Other than  these nomenclature differences, the mechanics of reading and writing CLOB data parallels those  of its BLOB sibling.    When you use an oracle.sql.CLOB object to write data to the database, you need to use the  three-step method outlined with the use of an oracle.sql.BLOB. That is, you need to create a  locator, retrieve the locator, and then use the locator via an oracle.sql.CLOB object to write  the CLOB data. Just as you use the empty_blob    database function to create a new locator  for a BLOB, you use the empty_clob    database function to create a new locator for a CLOB.  Once you have a valid locator, you can use one of the following methods from the  oracle.sql.CLOB class for writing CLOB data to a database:   OutputStream getAsciiOutputStream       Returns an OutputStream object that can be used to write CLOB data as ASCII  characters to the database using streams.    Writer getCharacterOutputStream       Returns an OutputStream object that can be used to write CLOB data as Unicode  characters to the database using streams.    int putChars long position, char[] buffer     Writes a char array  buffer  to a CLOB in the database. The writing begins at the  specified position within the CLOB in the database. This method returns the actual  number of characters written.     int putString long position, String string     Writes a String object  string  to a CLOB in the database. The writing begins at the  specified position within the CLOB in the database. This method returns the actual  number of characters written.    12.2.1.1 Using getCharacterOutputStream    to insert a CLOB   Example 12-6, TestCLOBGetCharacterOutputStream, is the CLOB version of Example  12-1. The getCharacterOutputStream    method works with Unicode, i.e., character data,  from a Java program. Since the CLOB example programs are almost the same as their BLOB  counterparts, I'll describe only the significant differences following the example.    Example 12-6. Using getCharacterOutputStream    to insert a CLOB   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.text.*;  import oracle.jdbc.driver.*;  import oracle.sql.CLOB;    public class TestCLOBGetCharacterOutputStream {    Connection conn;      public TestCLOBGetCharacterOutputStream     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      new TestCLOBGetCharacterOutputStream  .process    ;     }      public void process     throws IOException, SQLException {      int             rows      = 0;      FileReader      fin       = null;      Writer          out       = null;      ResultSet       rslt      = null;      Statement       stmt      = null;      CLOB            biography = null;     NOTE: oracle.sql.CLOB!!!      long            person_id = 0;        try {        conn.setAutoCommit false ;             Get Tim's person_id         stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select person_id " +            "from   person " +          "where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly' " +          "and    first_name = 'Tim'" ;           while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          person_id = rslt.getLong 1 ;        }        if  rows > 1  {          System.err.println "Too many rows!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        else if  rows == 0  {          System.err.println "Not found!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        rslt.close    ;        rslt = null;             Check to see the row already exists        rows = 0;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select biography " +         "from   person_information " +         "where  person_id = " + Long.toString  person_id   + " " +          "for update nowait" ;        while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          biography =  CLOB rslt.getClob 1 ;        }        rslt.close    ;        rslt = null;          if  rows == 0  {             Insert a row in the information table             This creates the LOB locators          rows = stmt.executeUpdate            "insert into person_information " +            "  person_id, biography, photo   " +            "values " +           "  " + Long.toString  person_id   +            ", empty_clob  , empty_blob      " ;          System.out.println rows + " rows inserted" ;              Retrieve the locator          rows = 0;          rslt = stmt.executeQuery            "select biography " +           "from   person_information " +           "where  person_id = " + Long.toString  person_id   + " " +            "for update nowait" ;          rslt.next    ;          biography =   OracleResultSet rslt .getCLOB 1 ;          rslt.close    ;          rslt = null;        }             Now that we have the locator, lets store the biography         File characterFile = new File "tim.txt" ;          fin = new FileReader characterFile ;        char[] buffer = new char[biography.getBufferSize    ];        out = biography.getCharacterOutputStream    ;        int length = 0;        while   length = fin.read buffer   != -1  {          out.write buffer, 0, length ;        }           You need to close the output stream before           you commit, or the changes are lost!        out.close    ;          out = null;        fin.close    ;        fin = null;        conn.commit    ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println "SQL Error: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      catch  IOException e  {        System.err.println "IO Error: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      finally {        if  rslt != null            try { rslt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  stmt != null            try { stmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }        if  out != null            try { out.close    ; }  catch  IOException ignore  { }         if  fin != null            try { fin.close    ; }  catch  IOException ignore  { }       }    }      protected void finalize          throws Throwable {      if  conn != null         try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       super.finalize    ;    }  }  In Example 12-6, the program stores a CLOB locator into an oracle.sql.CLOB object. Next,  it opens a large text file, tim.txt, using a Reader object. Then the program creates a character  buffer using the optimal buffer size from the locator. Next, the program gets a Writer from the  CLOB object by calling its getCharacterOutputStream    method. Then the program enters  a while loop from which the contents of the text file are streamed into the CLOB in the database.    Next, let's examine how using the ASCII method differs from this example.    12.2.1.2 Using getAsciiOutputStream      If your program does not use Unicode, you can use the getAsciiOutputStream    method  instead of getCharacterOutputStream   . Here's a program snippet using the BLOB  object's getAsciiOuputStream    method:   FileInputStream fin       = null;  OutputStream    out       = null;    ...        Now that we have the locator, lets store the biography     File asciiFile = new File "tim.txt" ;    fin = new FileInputStream asciiFile ;    byte[] buffer = new byte[biography.getBufferSize    ];     out = biography.getAsciiOutputStream    ;    int length = 0;    while   length = fin.read buffer   != -1  {      out.write buffer, 0, length ;    }  In this program snippet from TestCLOBGetAsciiOutputStream  a program listing you can  find in the examples online at this book's web page , all that is different between it and its  Unicode sibling, Example 12-6, is:       The use of an InputStream instead of a Reader      The use of an OutputStream instead of a Writer      The use of a byte array instead of a char array    Otherwise, the mechanics of the two programs are the same. Next, let's take a look at an  example using the PreparedStatement object.   12.2.2 Inserting a CLOB Using java.sql.PreparedStatement  Once again, when you use a PreparedStatement object, the process of writing CLOB data  parallels that of writing BLOB data. Specifically, the PreparedStatement object's methods  appear to bypass the use of a locator. At least they do from a programmer's perspective.    The PreparedStatement interface implements three methods that you need to know about.  The first is setCharacterStream   , which can be used to write Unicode data to a CLOB in  the database using streams. The method signature is:   setCharacterStream    int parameterIndex,    Reader reader,    int length   which breaks down as:  parameterIndex    The position of the placeholder in the prepared SQL statement, counting from left to right  and starting with 1    reader    length    A Reader object to be read by the driver   The size, in number of characters, of the data available from the Reader object    The second method is setAsciiStream   , which can be used to write ASCII data to a CLOB  in the database using streams. The method signature is:   setAsciiStream    int parameterIndex,    InputStream inputStream,    int length     which breaks down as:  parameterIndex    inputStream    length    The position of the placeholder in the prepared statement, counting from left to right and  starting with 1    An InputStream object to be read by the driver   The size, in number of bytes, of the data available from the input stream    The last method is setObject   , which can be used to write Unicode data to a CLOB in the  database from a String object. The method signature is:   setObject int parameterIndex, Object charArray   which breaks down as:  parameterIndex    The position of the placeholder in the prepared SQL statement, counting from left to right  and starting with 1    charArray    A char array containing the characters to be written to the database    Remember that the use of a PreparedStatement object to insert CLOB data is currently  supported using only the Version 8.1.6 OCI driver while connected to a Version 8.1.6 database.  Consider this when you decide whether to use the oracle.sql. BLOB object or the  PreparedStatement. Regardless, the process for inserting a CLOB using a  PreparedStatement object closely parallels its BLOB counterpart. All that really differs is the  use of a Reader instead of an InputSteam object. And, as always, writing ASCII data  represents the exception. When writing ASCII data, an InputStream object is used. Let's take a  look at inserting Unicode data.    12.2.2.1 Using setCharacterStream      Example 12-7 is the CLOB counterpart for Example 12-3 and inserts data into a CLOB using  the setCharacterStream    method. Except for the use of a Reader instead of an  InputStream and the call to the setCharacterStream    method instead of  setBinaryStream   , the programs are almost identical.   Example 12-7. Using setCharacterStream to insert a CLOB   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.text.*;    public class TestClobSetCharacterStream {    Connection conn;      public TestClobSetCharacterStream     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:oci8:@dssw2k01", "scott", "tiger" ;      }        catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      new TestClobSetCharacterStream  .process    ;    }      public void process     throws IOException, SQLException {       FileReader        fin       = null;      int               rows      = 0;      long              person_id = 0;      PreparedStatement pstmt     = null;      ResultSet         rslt      = null;      Statement         stmt      = null;        try {        conn.setAutoCommit false ;             Get Tim's person_id         stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select person_id " +          "from   person " +          "where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly' " +          "and    first_name = 'Tim'" ;           while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          person_id = rslt.getLong 1 ;        }        if  rows > 1  {          System.err.println "Too many rows!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        else if  rows == 0  {          System.err.println "Not found!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        rslt.close    ;        rslt = null;             Delete an existing row        rows = stmt.executeUpdate          "delete person_information " +         "where  person_id = " + Long.toString  person_id   ;           stmt.close    ;        stmt = null;             Insert the data bypassing the locator using a stream            This works only for oci8 driver 8.1.6 to database 8.1.6         pstmt = conn.prepareStatement          "insert into person_information " +          "  person_id, biography, photo   " +            "values " +         "  ?, ?, empty_blob      " ;          File characterFile = new File "tim2.txt" ;        long fileLength = characterFile.length    ;        fin = new FileReader characterFile ;          pstmt.setLong 1, person_id ;        pstmt.setCharacterStream 2, fin,  int fileLength ;         rows = pstmt.executeUpdate    ;        fin.close    ;        System.out.println rows + " rows inserted" ;          conn.commit    ;          pstmt.close    ;        pstmt = null;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println "SQL Error: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      catch  IOException e  {        System.err.println "IO Error: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      finally {        if  rslt != null             try { rslt.close    ;  } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  stmt != null             try { stmt.close    ;  } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  pstmt != null            try { pstmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }      }    }       protected void finalize          throws Throwable {      if  conn != null          try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       super.finalize    ;    }  }  12.2.2.2 Using setAsciiStream      If you're not going to write Unicode data, you may want to use the setAsciiStream    method  to insert CLOBs. In the following sample program snippet from TestClobSetAsciiStream   available with the examples you can download from this book's web page , the program uses the  setAsciiStream    method to bypass the CLOB locator when writing the ASCII data to the  database. What's significant here is that it uses an InputStream object to write ASCII, as  opposed to Writer.         Insert the data bypassing the locator using a strea m        This works only for oci8 driver 8.1.6 to database 8.1.6      pstmt = conn.prepareStatement       "insert into person_information " +       "  person_id, biography, photo   " +        "values " +         "  ?, ?, empty_blob      " ;       File asciiFile = new File "tim.txt" ;     long fileLength = asciiFile.length    ;     fin = new FileInputStream asciiFile ;       pstmt.setLong 1, person_id ;     pstmt.setAsciiStream 2, fin,  int fileLength ;     rows = pstmt.executeUpdate    ;     fin.close    ;     System.out.println rows + " rows inserted" ;       conn.commit    ;  Now that you know how to insert a CLOB, you also know how to update one!   12.2.3 Updating a CLOB  The process of updating a CLOB, that is, replacing the entire contents of the CLOB, is very  similar to updating a BLOB. The differences lie in the method you invoke and in the use of  Reader and Writer objects for streaming Unicode data.   12.2.3.1 Using oracle.sql.CLOB to update a CLOB   If you're going to use the getCharacterOutputStream    or getAsciiOutputStream     methods to update a CLOB in the database, then the update process will require the following  two steps:    1.  Retrieve an existing locator.   2.  Use the locator to update the data.   You retrieve a locator the same way you've seen in all the previous examples in this chapter --  you select the CLOB column from the database into a ResultSet object. Then you use the  ResultSet object's getClob    accessor method and cast its returned value to an  oracle.sql.CLOB. Alternatively, you can cast the ResultSet object to an  OracleResultSet object and use its getCLOB    method to retrieve the oracle.sql.CLOB  object directly.    Once you have the locator, you can call the CLOB object's getCharacterOutputStream     method to get a Writer object to use in writing Unicode data. Or, if you wish to write ASCII data,  you can call the getAsciiOutputStream method to get an OutputStream. After you have the  appropriate stream object, you can use it in a while loop, as I did in the earlier sections on  inserting a CLOB, to write the new CLOB data to the database.    12.2.3.2 Using java.sql.PreparedStatement   The process for using a PreparedStatement object's methods to update a CLOB closely  parallels the insert process. You just create a prepared UPDATE statement and use the  appropriate accessor method. So the difference lies solely in the use of an UPDATE statement  instead of an INSERT statement. To update Unicode data, use the setCharacterStream     method, passing it a Reader object. To update ASCII data, use setAsciiStream    method,  passing it an InputStream object.   12.2.4 Deleting a CLOB    Deleting a CLOB is accomplished by deleting the row in the database that contains the CLOB  locator, although when you think of deleting a CLOB, you may actually be thinking about how to  set the CLOB data to NULL. The easiest way to accomplish the latter is to execute an UPDATE  statement and specify the empty_clob    database function as the value for the column that  holds the CLOB locator. This replaces the existing locator with a new "empty" locator. This is as  close as you can get to a CLOB with NULL values. See the section Section 12.1.5 for an  example.   12.2.5 Selecting a CLOB  Only the methods in the java.sql.Clob interface allow you to retrieve CLOB data from a  database. The java.sql.Clob interface is implemented by the oracle.sql.CLOB class, so  the methods listed here can be found in both objects. These methods can be used to read CLOB  data from a database:   InputStream getAsciiStream       This method returns an InputStream object that can read ASCII data from a CLOB in  the database using streams.    Reader getCharacterStream       This method returns a Reader object that can read Unicode data from a CLOB in the  database using streams.    String getSubString long position, int length     This method can read a substring of data from a CLOB in the database. It returns a  String object containing the CLOB data. If you set position to 1 and length to the  length of the CLOB in the database, you can return the entire CLOB as a String.    The ResultSet interface provides a getClob    method, but it's used to get the locator for a  CLOB from a result set, not the CLOB's data. You must, in turn, use the locator to retrieve the  actual data. Therefore, selecting a CLOB's value from a database is a two-step process:    1.  Select a CLOB locator from a table.   2.  Use the java.sql.Clob object's getCharacterStream    or getAsciiStream      method to access the data.    Selecting a locator from the database is accomplished by selecting a CLOB column in the  database. The CLOB column in the database contains a locator, not the actual data. In your  program, create a java.sql.Clob variable to hold the locator returned by a call to the result  set's getClob    accessor method.    Once you have the locator in a Clob object, use the getCharacterStream    method to  retrieve it as a Unicode data stream or use the getAsciiStream    method to retrieve it as an  ASCII data stream. Let's take a look at an example using getCharacterStream   . Example  12-8 is a servlet, as it is in its BLOB counterpart in Example 12-5, except that it displays a  person's biography, not their photo, on your browser.    Example 12-8. A servlet to view a person's biography   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class TestClobCharacterServlet extends HttpServlet {        public void doGet      HttpServletRequest request,      HttpServletResponse response       throws IOException, ServletException {          PrintWriter out = response.getWriter    ;          Clob       biography  = null;      Connection connection = CacheConnection.checkOut    ;      Statement  statement  = null;      ResultSet  resultSet  = null;      String     sql        =       "select biography " +       "from   person p, person_information i " +       "where  p.person_id = i.person_id " +       "and    last_name = " +        formatWithTicks request.getParameter "last_name"   + " " +        "and    first_name = " +        formatWithTicks request.getParameter "first_name"  ;              try {         statement = connection.createStatement    ;        resultSet = statement.executeQuery sql ;        if  resultSet.next      {          biography = resultSet.getClob 1 ;        }        else {          response.setContentType "text html" ;          out.println "   Person  Biography  " ;          out.println "  No data found   " ;           return;        }        response.setContentType "text plain" ;          Reader in = biography.getCharacterStream    ;        System.out.println "after getCharacterStream" ;         int length =  int biography.length    ;        System.out.println "lenght of the Clob is " + length ;         char[] buffer = new char[1024];        while   length = in.read buffer   != -1  {          System.out.println "writing " + length + " chars" ;           out.write buffer, 0, length ;        }        System.out.println "written" ;        in.close    ;        in = null;        out.flush    ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.out.println          "TestClobCharacterServlet.doGet     SQLException: " +           e.getMessage     + "executing " ;        System.out.println sql ;      }      finally {          if  resultSet != null            try { resultSet.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  statement != null            try { statement.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }      }         Return the conection      CacheConnection.checkIn connection ;    }      public void doPost      HttpServletRequest request,      HttpServletResponse response      throws IOException, ServletException {      doGet request, response ;    }      private String formatWithTicks String string  {      if  string != null  {        char[]       in  = string.toCharArray    ;        StringBuffer out = new StringBuffer  int  in.length * 1.1  ;         if  in.length > 0           out.append "'" ;        for  int i=0;i < in.length;i++  {          out.append in[i] ;          if  in[i] == '\''              out.append in[i] ;        }        if  in.length > 0           out.append "'" ;        return out.toString    ;      }      else {        return "NULL";      }    }  }  Example 12-8, TestClobCharacterServlet, sets the content type to text plain and uses a  PrintWriter for output to the browser. It selects the biography column's locator from the  database and then uses it to get a Reader object. Using the Reader object in a while loop, the  contents of the CLOB are read from the database 1,024 characters at a time and are then written  to the browser.   12.2.6 Oracle CLOB Methods  The oracle.sql.CLOB class implements the java.sql.Clob interface. Here are the  oracle.sql.CLOB proprietary methods, all of which can throw an SQLException:   OutputStream getAsciiOutputStream      int getBufferSize      Writer getCharacterOutputStream      int getChars long pos, int length, char buffer[]   int getChunkSize      OracleConnection getConnection      boolean isConvertibleTo Class jClass   int putChars long pos, char chars[]   int putString long pos, String str     Object toJdbc      Now that you can manipulate BLOBs and CLOBs, lets take a look at Oracle's read-only binary file  extension, BFILE.   12.3 BFILEs  There are times when data, such as reference data, is provided by an external vendor on read- only media. You can go through the work of creating a database schema to hold the data, create  procedures to load the data into the database as BLOBs, and then repeat those procedures again  and again and again, as the reference data is updated, but BFILEs provide a better solution to  this problem. BFILEs allow you to simply go through the database and directly access the data on  the host's filesystem.    An instance of a oracle.sql.BFILE class is used in your Java program to hold a copy of a  BFILE's read-only locator from the database. You can then use the oracle.sql.BFILE object's  methods to retrieve the contents of the external binary file using streams.    To use BFILEs, you must follow these steps:   1.  Create a directory on the host's filesystem for your files and store your files there.    2.  Create a directory object in the database to store the host filesystem's directory   specification using the create directory DDL statement.    3.  Create a table to hold BFILE locators for the external binary files.   4.   Insert locators for the external binary files into the table.   5.  Retrieve the external binary file data using the BFILE locator.   In the earlier section on BLOBs, we stored a photo in the database. In this section, instead of  storing a photo in the database, we'll store it in an operating-system file. To do this, create a  BFILE directory, c:\TestBfile, on your host. Then create a directory object in the database to point  to that directory. Store the photo in that directory, create a BFILE locator  in a table  pointing to  the photo file, and finally, read the photo from the filesystem using the BFILE locator.   12.3.1 Creating a Directory Object  Your first task is to create a directory on a host's filesystem. For example:   mkdir c:\TestBfile  Then you have to create a directory object to represent it in the database. To accomplish this, use  the CREATE DIRECTORY statement. The CREATE DIRECTORY statement has the following  syntax:   CREATE DIRECTORY db_dir_name AS 'fs_dir_name'  which breaks down as:  db_dir_name    The logical name you use in the database to refer to the physical directory on the  filesystem   fs_dir_name    The filesystem's name for the directory   To execute the CREATE DIRECTORY command, you need to be logged in with a username that  has CREATE DIRECTORY rights. For this example, log in as System, create a directory called    TestBFile, and grant scott the rights to read it. You can do all this using the following SQL  commands:    * You need to be logged-in as System to have rights *   create directory TestBfile as 'c:\TestBfile'     grant read on directory TestBfile to scott     Now that you have a physical directory and a logical name for it in the database, you need to  create a table to hold BFILE entries.   12.3.2 Creating a BFILE Table  Creating a table to hold BFILE entries is quite similar to creating one for BLOBs and CLOBS. This  time, however, you specify a BFILE as the data type for the column. The following is sample DDL  for the person_picture table:   create table person_picture    person_id  number  not null,  picture    bfile    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100K next 100K pctincrease 0      alter  table person_picture add  constraint   person_picture_pk  primary key    person_id    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10K next 10K pctincrease 0      Now that you have a table to hold BFILE locators for person pictures, let's see how you add an  entry to the table.   12.3.3 Inserting a BFILE  You can insert a BFILE locator into the table using the bfilename    database function in a  manner similar to the use of empty_blob    with BLOBs. It has the following signature:   bfilename varchar2 directory_name, varchar2 file_name   which breaks down as:  directory_name    The name of a database directory object   file_name    The filesystem's name for the file    Example 12-9, TestBFILE, demonstrates the use of the bfilename    function to create a  BFILE locator in the person_picture table.   Example 12-9. Inserting a BFILE locator   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.text.*;      public class TestBFILE {    Connection conn;      public TestBFILE     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      new TestBFILE  .process    ;    }      public void process     throws IOException, SQLException {      int               rows      = 0;      ResultSet         rslt      = null;      Statement         stmt      = null;      long              person_id = 0;        try {        conn.setAutoCommit false ;                   Get Tim's person_id         stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select person_id " +          "from   person " +          "where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly' " +          "and    first_name = 'Tim'" ;           while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          person_id = rslt.getLong 1 ;        }        if  rows > 1  {          System.err.println "Too many rows!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        else if  rows == 0  {          System.err.println "Not found!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        rslt.close    ;        rslt = null;                   Delete an existing row        rows = stmt.executeUpdate          "delete person_picture " +         "where  person_id = " + Long.toString  person_id   ;                   rows = stmt.executeUpdate          "insert into person_picture " +          "  person_id, picture   " +          "values " +         "  " + Long.toString  person_id   +          ", bfilename  'TESTBFILE', 'tim.gif'    " ;                System.out.println rows + " rows inserted" ;                conn.commit    ;          stmt.close    ;        stmt = null;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println "SQL Error: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      finally {        if  rslt != null             try { rslt.close    ;  } catch  SQLException ign ore  { }        if  stmt != null             try { stmt.close    ;  } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       }    }      protected void finalize          throws Throwable {      if  conn != null          try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       super.finalize    ;    }  }  The program starts in its main    method by instantiating a copy of itself and executing its  process    method. The process    method begins by creating several variables:   rows    An integer to keep track of the number of rows returned by, or affected by, the various  executeXXX    methods    rslt    stmt    person_id    A ResultSet used to hold the results of your query to get the person_id from the  person table    A Statement to hold the statement object returned by the createStatement     method    A long to hold the primary key for the row that will be inserted    After creating the variables, the program enters a try block in which the bulk of the processing  occurs. In the try block, the program first turns off auto-commit. Next, it creates a Statement  object and uses it to query the database for the primary key required to insert an entry into the  person_picture table. The results of the query are returned as a ResultSet object, which in  turn is walked through by the while statement to get the person_id. The program continues by  deleting any existing entry for the person_id. Next, the program inserts a row into the database    utilizing the database function bfilename    to create the BFILE locator for the specified  directory object and filename. Finally, the INSERT statement is committed.    As you can see from this example, we did not create the BFILE locator in our Java program. Just  like the BLOB and CLOB locators, the BFILE locator can be created only by the database.   12.3.4 Updating a BFILE  There are two ways you can update a BFILE. First, you can use the bfilename    database  function to recreate the BFILE locator. Second, you can copy a valid BFILE locator from one row  or table to another. In the first instance, you would use the same syntax in an UPDATE statement  that you just used in the INSERT statement. In the second instance, you would place the BFILE  into an oracle.sql.BFILE variable  an oracle.sql.BFILE is a Java class that holds a read- only BFILE locator from the database  from a ResultSet and then use the  OraclePreparedStatement object's setBFILE    method to update it.   12.3.5 Deleting a BFILE  Deleting a BFILE is simply a process of deleting the row in which the BFILE locator exists. You  may consider setting the locator column to NULL to denote that no external file exists. Rather  than do that, however, I recommend that you create an empty file in the filesystem and point to  that file instead. I make this recommendation because if you try to retrieve and use a BFILE  locator where the column is NULL, you'll get a NullPointerException. It's easier to  implement a "no value" BFILE by retrieving an empty file.   12.3.6 Selecting BFILEs  Once you have a BFILE locator in a table, you can access the data directly from the filesystem  through Oracle by using the BFILE object's openFile   , getBinaryStream   , and  closeFile    methods. Example 12-10, TestBFILEServlet, does just that.   Example 12-10. A servlet to view a person's photo stored as a BFILE   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;  import oracle.jdbc.driver.*;  import oracle.sql.BFILE;    public class TestBFILEServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet      HttpServletRequest request,      HttpServletResponse response       throws IOException, ServletException {             ServletOutputStream out = response.getOutputStream    ;              BFILE      photo      = null;      Connection connection = CacheConnection.checkOut    ;      Statement  statement  = null;      ResultSet  resultSet  = null;      String     sql        =       "select picture " +       "from   person p, person_picture i " +       "where  p.person_id = i.person_id " +         "and    last_name = " +        formatWithTicks request.getParameter "last_name"   + " " +        "and    first_name = " +        formatWithTicks request.getParameter "first_name"  ;         try {         statement = connection.createStatement    ;        resultSet = statement.executeQuery sql ;        if  resultSet.next      {          photo =   OracleResultSet resultSet .getBFILE 1 ;         }        else {          response.setContentType "text html" ;          out.println "   Person Photo  " ;           out.println "  No data found   " ;          return;        }        response.setContentType "image gif" ;        photo.openFile    ;        InputStream in = photo.getBinaryStream    ;        System.out.println "after getBinaryStream" ;        int length =  int photo.length    ;        System.out.println "lenght of the blob is " + length ;         byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];        while   length = in.read buffer   != -1  {          System.out.println "writing " + length + " bytes" ;           out.write buffer, 0, length ;        }        System.out.println "written" ;        in.close    ;        in = null;        photo.closeFile    ;        out.flush    ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.out.println "TestBFILEServlet.doGet     SQLException: " +           e.getMessage     + "executing " ;        System.out.println sql ;      }      finally {        if  resultSet != null            try { resultSet.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  statement != null            try { statement.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }      }         Return the conection      CacheConnection.checkIn connection ;    }      public void doPost      HttpServletRequest request,      HttpServletResponse response      throws IOException, ServletException {      doGet request, response ;    }      private String formatWithTicks String string  {        if  string != null  {        char[]       in  = string.toCharArray    ;        StringBuffer out = new StringBuffer  int  in.length * 1.1  ;         if  in.length > 0           out.append "'" ;        for  int i=0;i < in.length;i++  {          out.append in[i] ;          if  in[i] == '\''              out.append in[i] ;        }        if  in.length > 0           out.append "'" ;        return out.toString    ;      }      else {        return "NULL";      }    }  }  Using the same URL syntax used for TestBLOBServlet in Example 12-5, this servlet,  TestBFILEServlet, retrieves the BFILE locator from the database and then opens the file  using openFile   . Next, it enters a while loop from which it reads the contents of the file  using an InputStream object returned by the getBinaryStream    method. In the while  loop, the servlet writes to the browser all data read from the BFILE. When the while loop is  complete, the input stream is closed, and the file reference is closed using closeFile   . You  can use the TestBFILEServlet program to verify that the earlier TestBFILE program   Example 12-9  correctly created a BFILE locator.   12.3.7 BFILE Methods  The following is a list of the oracle.sql.BFILE methods, all of which can throw an  SQLException:   InputStream asciiStreamValue      void closeFile      boolean fileExists      InputStream getBinaryStream      byte[] getBytes long pos, int length   int getBytes long pos, int length, byte buf[]   OracleConnection getConnection      String getDirAlias      String getName      boolean isConvertibleTo Class jClass   boolean isFileOpen      long length      void openFile      long position BFILE pattern, long start   long position byte pattern[], long start   Object toJdbc      At this point, we've covered the three large data types that Oracle recommends you use. The  remaining two, LONG RAW and LONG, collectively known as LONGs, were used with Oracle7.  And though they remain only as a means to be backward-compatible, they are still viable, and  therefore, we shall cover them briefly.   12.4 LONG RAWs    As I stated indirectly at the beginning of the chapter, the BLOB data type has replaced the LONG  RAW data type. This does not mean, however, that LONG RAW is no longer useful. There are  many applications in which Oracle7 or LONGs are still in use and in which, consequently, LONG  RAW is the only option for storing large amounts of binary data. Given this fact, it is valuable for  you to understand how this data type can be manipulated.    Unlike the three LOB types, which you access via locators, there is no locator involved when  accessing a LONG RAW. When a query selects a LONG RAW column, the data is immediately  available using the getXXX    accessor methods. The JDBC driver transfers data for these  columns between the database and the client using streams. Even if you get the data as a byte  array, the driver streams the data for you.   12.4.1 Creating a Table with a LONG RAW  Of course, to use a LONG RAW data type, you first need to create a table that uses a LONG  RAW. As I stated at the beginning of the chapter, LONGs have restrictions that the other large  data types do not. One of the most important restrictions is that you can have only one LONG  column in a table. When using LOBs, you can combine both the biography and photo columns  in one person_information table. However, when using LONGs, you need to create two  tables, one for the biography and a second for the photo. Since we're discussing the binary  LONG RAW, I'll mention that you can create a person_photo table using the following DDL:   drop   table person_photo     create table person_photo    person_id  number  not null,  photo      long raw    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100K next 100K pctincrease 0      alter  table person_photo add  constraint   person_photo_pk  primary key    person_id    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10K next 10K pctincrease 0      Now that you have your table, let's take a look at how to insert values into a LONG RAW column.   12.4.2 Inserting a LONG RAW  To insert values into a LONG RAW column, use the PreparedStatement object's  setBinaryStream    method or setBytes    method. Both methods stream the data just as  they do for the locator data types, but the setBinaryStream    method is more efficient  because you don't need a buffer large enough to hold all your binary data. Instead, you can use a  fairly small buffer and send the data one small buffer at a time. Example 12-11 demonstrates  an insert operation using setBinaryStream   .   Example 12-11. Inserting a LONG RAW   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;    public class TestLongRawSetBinaryStream {    Connection conn;         TestLongRawSetBinaryStream     {      try {        Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;         conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger"  ;       }      catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.err.println "Class Not Found Error: " + e.getMessage     ;         System.exit 1 ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println "SQL Error: " + e.getMessage     ;        System.exit 1 ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args  {      new TestLongRawSetBinaryStream  .process    ;     }      private void process     {      FileInputStream   fin       = null;      int               rows      = 0;      long              person_id = 0;      PreparedStatement pstmt     = null;      Statement         stmt      = null;      ResultSet         rslt      = null;        try {        conn.setAutoCommit false ;             Get Tim's person_id         stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select person_id " +          "from   person " +          "where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly' " +          "and    first_name = 'Tim'" ;           while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          person_id = rslt.getLong 1 ;        }        if  rows > 1  {          System.err.println "Too many rows!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        else if  rows == 0  {          System.err.println "Not found!" ;          System.exit 1 ;        }        rslt.close    ;        rslt = null;          rows = stmt.executeUpdate          "delete person_photo " +          "where  person_id = " + Long.toString person_id  ;         System.out.println rows + " rows deleted" ;             stmt.close    ;        stmt = null;          pstmt = conn.prepareStatement          "insert into person_photo " +          "  person_id, photo   " +         "values " +         "  ?, ?  " ;        pstmt.setLong 1, person_id ;          File fileName = new File "tim.gif" ;        long fileLength = fileName.length    ;        fin = new FileInputStream fileName ;        System.out.println fileLength + " bytes read" ;         pstmt.setBinaryStream 2, fin,  int fileLength ;         rows = pstmt.executeUpdate    ;        System.out.println rows + " rows inserted" ;          fin.close    ;        fin = null;          conn.commit    ;          pstmt.close    ;        pstmt = null;      }      catch  IOException e  {        System.out.println "IO Error: " + e.getMessage     ;         System.exit 1 ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.out.println "SQL Error: " + e.getMessage     ;         System.exit 1 ;      }      finally {        if  rslt != null            try { rslt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }         if  stmt != null            try { stmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }        if  fin  != null            try { fin.close    ;  } catch  IOException ignore  { }       }    }      protected void finalize     throws Throwable {      if  conn != null          try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ig nore  { }      super.finalize    ;    }  }  For the most part, TestLongRawSetBinaryStream functions the same as our BLOB sample  program, TestBlobSetBinaryStream, shown in Example 12-3. The only significant  difference is that the program does not bypass a locator to write the binary values, because a  LONG RAW data type does not use a locator. Once again, it is worth noting that the    FileInputStream needs to be closed after the executeUpdate    call but before the  commit, to make sure all the data is written to the database.   12.4.3 Updating a LONG RAW  Updating LONG RAW is accomplished using the same methods used to insert the values --  namely, setBinaryStream    and setBytes   . Your only concern is to lock the table row  by using the SELECT FOR UPDATE syntax as you do when updating the locator data types.   12.4.4 Deleting a LONG RAW  To delete a LONG RAW just delete its row. Unlike the locator data types, you can also set the  LONG RAW column to NULL without the adverse effect of later retrieving an invalid locator,  because no locator is used with LONG RAW.   12.4.5 Selecting a LONG RAW  Selecting a LONG RAW is done as easily as inserting one but with some important access order  rules. To retrieve the data as a stream, use the getBinaryStream    method. However, when  retrieving the data, you must call the getXXX    methods for all the columns in the SELECT  statement in the same order as the columns are listed in the SELECT statement, and when you  call a streaming data type, you must process the data immediately, that is, before you call any  another getXXX    method, or the streamed data will no longer be accessible. Any columns  following a LONG RAW column are not accessible until you read the contents of the LONG RAW  column. If you want to bypass the LONG RAW column, get its stream using getBinaryStream     and then immediately call the stream's close    method. Once the column is skipped, its data  will no longer be accessible. Example 12-12 is a servlet that retrieves and displays a person's  photo from the LONG RAW column in the person_photo table.   Example 12-12. A servlet to view a person's photo stored as a LONG RAW   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;    public class TestLongRawServlet extends HttpServlet {       public void doGet      HttpServletRequest request,      HttpServletResponse response       throws IOException, ServletException {        ServletOutputStream out = response.getOutputStream    ;         Connection conn = CacheConnection.checkOut    ;      Statement  stmt = null;      ResultSet  rslt = null;        response.setContentType "image gif" ;        try {        stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery "select photo from person_photo" ;         if  rslt.next      {          byte[] buffer = new byte[32];            int    length = 0;          InputStream in = rslt.getBinaryStream 1 ;          while   length = in.read buffer   != -1  {            out.write buffer, 0, length ;          }        }        else {          response.setContentType "text html" ;          out.println "   Person Photo  " ;           out.println "  No data found   " ;          return;        }        stmt.close    ;        stmt = null;      }      catch SQLException e  {        System.out.println "SQLException cause: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      finally {        if  rslt != null            try { rslt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignored  {}         if  stmt != null            try { stmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignored  {}       }      CacheConnection.checkIn conn ;    }  }  Just like its BLOB peer, TestBlobServlet in Example 12-5, our LONG RAW servlet,  TestLongRawServlet, retrieves the data as a stream and writes it directly to the browser.  However, this time, no special locator method is used. Instead, the ResultSet object's  getBinaryStream    method is called. The program could also have used the getBytes     method, which would not have returned a stream.    When working with LONG RAW, using the getBytes    or setBytes    methods makes  coding simpler than using streams. However, these methods require significantly more memory,  so use them cautiously. It is better to use the streaming methods.    You can prevent the JDBC driver from streaming the LONG RAW data by using the  OracleResultSet object's defineColumnType    method and setting the data type to  Types.VARBINARY. An important side effect of using LONGs is that any time the JDBC driver  encounters a streamed data type such as a LONG RAW, the prefetch buffer and the Oracle  batching executeUpdate value are both set to 1. This means that row prefetching and batching  are effectively disabled whenever you access a table with any streaming data type.    Now that you understand how to manipulate a LONG RAW, let's take a look at the character- specific data type, LONG.   12.5 LONGs  Just like the LONG RAW data type, a LONG data type is streamed. And, like a CLOB data type, a  LONG is subject to NLS character set conversion. LONG column values can be updated using  the PreparedStatement object's setAsciiStream   , setBinary-Stream   , and  setCharacterStream    streaming methods. Alternatively, LONG values can be updated  using the setBytes    and setString    methods. LONG column values are read using the  ResultSet object's complementary get methods. The streaming get methods are    getAsciiStream   , getBinaryStream   , and getCharacter-Stream   ; the  nonstreaming get methods are getBytes    and getString   .   12.5.1 Inserting or Updating a LONG  Other than the use of the methods just mentioned, when inserting or updating a LONG, there are  limitations on the size of a String or byte array that you can update using the setString     or setBytes    methods. These limitations are listed in Table 11-3. When you exceed these  limits, you will get the following error message: "Data size bigger than max size for this type:  ." To work around these limitations, you need to use the streaming methods.   12.5.2 Selecting a LONG  To retrieve data in ASCII, use the ResultSet object's getAsciiStream    method. You can  use the getAsciiStream    method only if the underlying database uses the US7ASCII or  WE8ISO8859P1 character set. Otherwise, you can use the getCharacterStream    method,  which returns UCS-2-encoded characters  Unicode  regardless of the underlying database's  character set. Even if you get the data as a String, the JDBC driver will stream the data for you.    If you use the getBinaryStream    method, one of two possibilities exists. If you are using the  OCI driver, and its client character set is not set to US7ASCII or WE8ISO8859P1, then a call to  the getBinaryStream    method returns data in the UTF-8 character set. If you are using the  Thin driver, and the database's character set is not set to US7ASCII or WE8ISO8859P1, then a  call to the getBinaryStream    method also returns data in the UTF-8 character set.  Otherwise, you'll get the data in the US7ASCII character set.    As with the LONG RAW data type, you must call the getXXX    methods for each column  returned by the SELECT statement in the same order in which those columns are listed in the  SELECT statement. Also, when processing a streamed column, you must process the streamed  data before calling another getXXX    method. Once you move on to another getXXX     method, the streamed data is no longer accessible. In addition, you can prevent the JDBC driver  from streaming LONG data by using the OracleResultSet object's defineColumnType     method, setting the data type of a LONG column to Types.VARCHAR. This may be desirable if  there are a small number of characters in the data to be stored.    Now that you are an expert on using streaming data types, let's take a look at how to call stored  procedures in Chapter 13.   Chapter 13. Callable Statements  CallableStatement objects are used to call stored procedures. The stored procedures  themselves can be written using PL SQL or Java. If they are written in Java, they must be  published to the RDBMS by creating a SQL call specification. You can see examples of this in  Chapter 5. Stored procedures exist to perform data-intensive operations that cannot be  accomplished using just SQL, and they perform these operations inside the database where  network performance is a moot issue.    For example, let's say you need to access five different tables in order to perform a complex  calculation and need to store the result in a sixth table. Let's further assume that the calculation is  complex enough that it cannot be performed using just SQL. If you perform the work on a client,  then the client will have to retrieve all the data necessary to perform the calculation and send the  result back to the database. If the number of rows that need to be retrieved by the client is large,  this network transfer of data could consume an inordinate amount of elapsed time. However, if  you perform the calculation as a stored procedure, the elapsed time of transmitting data across    the network will be eliminated, and the resulting calculation will be much quicker. This example  represents the type of situation in which stored procedures excel.    As with all good things, stored procedures are sometimes taken to an extreme and are  sometimes used as a panacea. For example, some developers eliminate SQL from their  application altogether and use only stored procedures. This is not a good use of Oracle stored  procedures, simply because selecting data from a table from your application is faster than calling  a stored procedure that selects data from a table and returns it to your application. When you go  through a stored procedure, you have two network round trips instead of one.    Enough with my soapbox speeches! Let's get on to some real meat. In this chapter, you'll learn  how to identify the parameters for, and formulate, stored procedure calls using both SQL92 and  Oracle syntax. You'll learn how to create a CallableStatement object to execute stored  procedures, how to set and retrieve parameter values, and how to actually execute a stored  procedure. Let's get started by looking at how to identify stored procedure names and parameter  types.   13.1 Understanding Stored Procedures  With Oracle, stored procedure actually refers collectively to standalone stored functions,  standalone procedures, packaged functions, and procedures. So when I use the term stored  procedure in this chapter, please understand that I am referring generally to any of these  procedure or function types.    To call a stored procedure, you need to know the procedure name and know about any  parameters that will be passed to the procedure. In the case of a function, you also need to know  the return type. One way to get this information is to query Oracle's data dictionary views for  stored procedure source code and look at the signature for the procedures you wish to use. The  next section shows you how to interpret Oracle's stored procedure signatures. Following that is a  section that shows you, among other things, how to query the data dictionary for procedure  signatures.   13.1.1 Stored Procedure Signatures  It's important to know the differences in the syntax used by stored procedures so you can code  your callable statements appropriately. Oracle stored procedures are created using three different  syntaxes, one for standalone functions, another for standalone procedures, and a third for  functions and procedures that are part of a package.    13.1.1.1 Standalone functions   The difference between a procedure and function is that a function returns a value, so it can be  used as an evaluated item in an expression. The syntax to create a stored function is:   CREATE [OR REPLACE] [user.]FUNCTION function_name   [ parameters ]    RETURN data_type {AS  IS}  function_body    parameters ::= parameter_declaration [,parameter_declaration...]    parameter_declaration ::= parameter_name [IN  OUT  IN OUT] data_type   which breaks down as:  user    The schema owner of the function.    function_name    The name of the function.   RETURN   data_type    parameter_name    IN  OUT  IN OUT    Specifies the SQL data type returned by the function.   The name of a parameter passed to the function. Zero or more parameters may be  passed to a function.    Specifies the use of a parameter. An IN parameter can be read, but you cannot write to it.  An OUT parameter can be written to but not read. You can both read from and write to an  IN OUT parameter.    data_type    The SQL data type of the parameter.   For example, to create an errorless TO_NUMBER function for user SCOTT, log into Oracle with  SQL*Plus as SCOTT TIGER and execute the following PL SQL code:   create or replace function ToNumberFun    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2    return          number is  begin   return to_number  aiv_varchar2  ;  exception   when OTHERS then    return null;  end ToNumberFun;     13.1.1.2 Standalone procedures   Use the following syntax to create a standalone stored procedure. A procedure does not return a  value. However, both functions and procedures can have OUT or IN OUT variables that return  values.   CREATE [OR REPLACE] [user.]PROCEDURE procedure_name  [ parameters ] {AS  IS}  procedure_body  parameters ::= parameter_declaration [,parameter_declaration...]    parameter_declaration ::= parameter name [IN  OUT  IN OUT] data_type   See Section 13.1.1.1 for an explanation of the syntax.    13.1.1.3 Packages   A package is a collection of related functions and procedures. It has a specification that defines  which functions, procedures, and variables are publicly accessible. It also has a body that  contains the functions and procedures defined in the specification and possibly also contains  private functions, private procedures, and private variable declarations. Packages are an  improvement over standalone functions and procedures, because the separation between the  specification and body reduces stored procedure dependency problems. The syntax for creating  a package specification is:   CREATE [OR REPLACE] PACKAGE package_name AS  package_specification    in which package_name is the name of the package. The following syntax is used to create a  package body:   CREATE [OR REPLACE] PACKAGE BODY package_name AS  package_body  Why is this explanation of stored procedure syntax important? Because you need to understand  the stored procedure syntax in order to know the name of a stored procedure  or function , which  data types you can pass to it, and which data type it returns.   13.1.2 Describing Signatures  If you want to invoke a stored procedure and double-check its name and the parameters you  must pass to it, you can take one of several approaches. If you have access to SQL*Plus, you  can use one of the following variations on the DESCRIBE command:   desc[ribe] [schema.]function_name  desc[ribe] [schema.]procedure_name  desc[ribe] [schema.]package_name  The following example shows the DESCRIBE command being used to display information about  the ToNumberFun function owned by the user Scott:   SQL> desc tonumberfun  FUNCTION tonumberfun RETURNS NUMBER   Argument Name                  Type                    In Out Default?    ------------------------------ ----------------------- ------ --------   AIV_VARCHAR2                   VARCHAR2                IN   The JDBC API defines a method, named DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns   ,  you can invoke to get stored procedure signature data. In practice, however, the  getProcedureColumns    method is not all that useful. Oracle stored procedures can be  overloaded, and, using getProcedureColumns   , you can't distinguish between the different  overloaded versions of the same stored procedure. So, for Oracle at least, the  getProcedureColumns    method is useless.    A third way to determine the signature for a standalone function, standalone procedure, or  package is to take a peek at the source code. The program named  DescribeStoredProcedures, shown in Example 13-1, does this. You pass in the name of a  stored procedure on the command line, then the program queries the SYS.DBA_SOURCE view  for the source code and displays that source code. If you don't have access to the DBA views,  you can change the program to use SYS.ALL_SOURCE.    Example 13-1. Describing a stored procedure   import java.io.*;  import java.sql.*;  import java.text.*;    public class DescribeStoredProcedures {    Connection conn;      public DescribeStoredProcedures     {      try {        DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;        conn = DriverManager.getConnection          "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl", "scott", "tiger" ;       }      catch  SQLException e  {          System.err.println e.getMessage     ;        e.printStackTrace    ;      }    }      public static void main String[] args       throws Exception, IOException {      String storedProcedureName = null;      String schemaName          = null;      if  args.length > 0          schemaName          = args[0];      if  args.length > 1          storedProcedureName = args[1];      new DescribeStoredProcedures    .process        schemaName, storedProcedureName ;    }      public void process      String schemaName,      String storedProcedureName       throws SQLException {        int rows                    = 0;      ResultSet rslt              = null;      Statement stmt              = null;      String previous             = "~";      String schemaPattern        = "%";      String procedureNamePattern = "%";        try {        if  schemaName != null && !schemaName.equals ""              schemaPattern = schemaName;        if  storedProcedureName != null &&  !storedProcedureName.equals ""             procedureNamePattern = storedProcedureName;        stmt = conn.createStatement    ;        rslt = stmt.executeQuery          "select type' 'owner'.'name, line, text "  +          "from   sys.dba_source " +          "where  type = 'FUNCTION' " +          "and    owner like '" + schemaPattern + "' " +          "and    name  like '" + procedureNamePattern + "' " +           "union all " +         "select type' 'owner'.'name, line, text " +          "from   sys.dba_source " +          "where  type = 'PROCEDURE' " +          "and    owner like '" + schemaPattern + "' " +          "and    name  like '" + procedureNamePattern + "' " +           "union all " +         "select type' 'owner'.'name, line, text " +          "from   sys.dba_source " +          "where  type = 'PACKAGE' " +          "and    owner like '" + schemaPattern + "' " +          "and    name  like '" + procedureNamePattern + "' " +           "union all " +         "select type' 'owner'.'name, line, text " +          "from   sys.dba_source " +            "where  type = 'TYPE' " +          "and    owner like '" + schemaPattern + "' " +          "and    name  like '" + procedureNamePattern + "' " +           "order by 1, 2" ;        while  rslt.next      {          rows++;          if  !rslt.getString 1 .equals previous   {            if  !previous.equals "~"              System.out.println "" ;            previous = rslt.getString 1 ;          }          System.out.print rslt.getString 3  ;        }        if  !previous.equals "~"            System.out.println "" ;      }      catch  SQLException e  {        System.err.println "SQL Error: " + e.getMessage     ;       }      finally {        if  rslt != null             try { rslt.close    ;  } catch  SQLException ignore  { }        if  stmt != null             try { stmt.close    ;  } catch  SQLException ignore  { }       }    }      protected void finalize          throws Throwable {      if  conn != null          try { conn.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore  { }      super.finalize    ;    }  }  Here are the results of using DescribeStoredProcedures to describe the  scott.ToNumberFun function:   C:\>java DescribeStoredProcedures SCOTT TONUMBERFUN  function ToNumberFun    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2    return          number is  begin   return to_number  aiv_varchar2  ;  exception   when OTHERS then    return null;  Of course, the best place to get information on stored procedure names and parameters is from  written documentation, but we all know that from time to time, written documentation is not  available. Consequently, the SQL*Plus DESCRIBE command and the  DescribeStoredProcedures program can be quite handy.    Once you have the signature for the stored procedure you wish to execute, there is a problem  that can arise: the username that will execute the stored procedure may not have the rights to do  so.     The SYS.DBA and SYS.V_$ Views   Every developer who plans to work with an Oracle database should have  access to the SYS.DBA and SYS.V_$ views. These views show all the  objects for all the schemas in a database, even if the current user does  not have access to them. At the same time, they do not show any of the  actual data in schemas that a developer does not have access to, so  they can't be used for malicious activities.   If a developer does have access to these views, she can determine  whether a problem with not finding a database object is due to grants  or  lack thereof  or due to the fact that an object does not actually exist in  the database. She can do this by comparing the output of the SYS.ALL  views, which everyone typically has access to, against their SYS.DBA  counterparts.   So if you don't have access to the DBA views, request it. It will save you  a great deal of time to be able to query the data dictionary views  yourself.    13.1.3 Granting Execute Rights  If you've written a stored procedure, how do you determine who has access to it? Initially, only  you, the owner of the stored procedure, and anyone who has been granted the EXECUTE ANY  PROCEDURE system privilege have access to your new procedure. But how can you tell if  another user has EXECUTIVE rights? Examine the SYS.ALL_TAB_PRIVS view and look at the  rows from the view that contain the name of the stored procedure in the table_name column.  The view and column names make doing this a bit confusing, but that's the way things work. For  example, to see who has access to user SCOTT's ToNumberFun function, execute the following  query:   select grantee,         privilege   from   sys.all_tab_privs   where  table_name   = 'TONUMBERFUN'  and    table_schema = 'SCOTT'  This gets results such as the following:  GRANTEE                        PRIVILEGE  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------  SYSTEM                         EXECUTE  In this case, because no users are listed in the output, you know that user SCOTT has not yet  granted anyone else access to ToNumberFun. If you find that a particular username or role  needs to be granted access to a stored procedure, you or your DBA can grant those rights using  the following form of the GRANT statement:   GRANT EXECUTE ON [schema.]stored_procedure TO {user_name  role_name}  which breaks down as:  schema    Optionally used by a DBA to grant someone access to another user's object     stored_procedure    user_name  role_name    The name of a standalone function, standalone procedure, or package   The name of the user or role to which you are granting EXECUTE rights   Given the information in this section, you can check whether a stored procedure that does not  seem to exist really does not exist or if the EXECUTE privilege has just not been granted to the  desired user.    Now that you have some background in Oracle stored procedure signatures and in the granting of  EXECUTE privileges, let's take a look at how to formulate a stored procedure call for a callable  statement.   13.2 Calling Stored Procedures  Calling a stored procedure from your Java program requires a five-step process:    1.  Formulate a callable statement.   2.  Create a CallableStatement object.   3.  Register any OUT parameters.   4.  Set any IN parameters.   5.  Execute the callable statement.   In the sections that follow, I'll describe each of the steps listed here. The function ToNumberFun,  owned by the user SCOTT, will form the basis for most of the examples.   13.2.1 Formulating a Callable Statement  The first step in the process of calling a stored procedure is to formulate a stored procedure call,  that is, properly format a string value that will be passed to a Connection object's  prepareCall    method in order to create a CallableStatement object. When it comes to  formulating a stored procedure call, you have two syntaxes at your disposal: the SQL92 escape  syntax and the Oracle syntax. In theory, because it's not vendor-specific, the SQL92 escape  syntax gives you better portability. But let's be realistic. Stored procedure capabilities and syntax  vary wildly from one database vendor to another. If you choose to invest in stored procedures, I'd  say you're not too interested in portability. Nonetheless, let's first take a look at the SQL92  escape syntax.    13.2.1.1 SQL92 escape syntax   When using the SQL92 escape syntax, the String object or string literal you pass to the  Connection object's prepareCall    method to create a CallableStatement object takes  on one of the following forms:   {? = call [schema.][package.]function_name[ ?,?,... ]}     {call [schema.][package.]procedure_name[ ?,?,... ]}  which breaks down as:   schema    Refers to the stored procedure's owner's username or schema name     package    function_name    procedure_name    ?    Refers to a package name and applies only when you are not calling a standalone  function or procedure    Refers to the name of a standalone function or to the name of a function in a package    Refers to the name of a standalone procedure or to the name of a procedure in a  package    A placeholder for an IN, OUT, or IN OUT parameter, or for the return value of a function    In this syntax diagram, the curly braces  {}  are part of the  syntax; they do not, in this case, denote optional choices.          The question mark characters  ?  in the procedure or function call mark the locations of  parameters that you supply later, after creating the CallableStatement object and before  executing the statement. For example, consider the following signature for the ToNumberFun  standalone function:   create or replace function ToNumberFun    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2    return number;   The properly formatted callable statement string for this function would look like:   { ? = call tonumberfun  ?   }  If you are calling a stored procedure rather than a stored function, omit the leading ? =  characters. That's because procedures do not return a value as functions do. The following is an  example of a standalone procedure:   create or replace procedure ToNumberPrc    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2,  aon_number out number    begin   aon_number := to_number  aiv_varchar2  ;  exception   when OTHERS then    aon_number := null;  end ToNumberPrc;     A properly formatted callable statement string for the ToNumberPrc procedure would look like:   { call tonumberprc  ?, ?   }  If the procedure or function that you are calling is part of a stored package, then you need to  reference the package name when creating your callable statement. The following is a package  named chapter_13 that implements a procedure and a function, both of which are named  ToNumber:   REM  The specification    create or replace package chapter_13 as    function ToNumber      aiv_varchar2 in varchar2    return number;    procedure ToNumber    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2,  aon_number out number  ;    end;       REM  The body    create or replace package body chapter_13 as    function ToNumber    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2    return number is  begin   return to_number  aiv_varchar2  ;  exception   when OTHERS then    return null;  end ToNumber;    procedure ToNumber    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2,  aon_number out number   is  begin   aon_number := to_number  aiv_varchar2  ;  exception   when OTHERS then    aon_number := null;  end ToNumber;    end;     The callable statement strings for the ToNumber function and procedure defined in the  chapter_13 package would look like:   { ? = call chapter_13.tonumber  ?   }    { call chapter_13.tonumber  ?, ?   }  Now that you understand the SQL92 escape syntax, let's take a look at Oracle's syntax for  callable statements.    13.2.1.2 Oracle syntax   Oracle's syntax, which is PL SQL syntax, is very similar to SQL92 syntax:   begin ?:=[schema.][package.]function_name[ ?,?,... ]; end;     begin [schema.][package.]procedure_name[ ?,?,... ]; end;  This breaks down as:   schema    Refers to the stored procedure owner's username or schema name    package    function_name    procedure_name    ?    Refers to a package name and applies if you are not calling a standalone stored  procedure    Refers to the name of a standalone function or to the name of a function in a package  specification    Refers to the name of a standalone procedure or to the name of a procedure in a  package specification    A placeholder for an IN, OUT, or IN OUT parameter, or for the return value of a function.    The Oracle syntax for callable-statement string literals for the four stored procedure signatures  shown in the previous section on SQL92 syntax is described here:    For the standalone function ToNumberFun with a signature of:   function ToNumberFun    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2    return number;  the callable statement string is:  begin ? := tonumberfun  ?  ; end;  For the standalone procedure ToNumberProc with a signature of:   procedure ToNumberPrc    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2,  aon_number out number    the callable statement string is:  begin tonumberprc  ?, ?  ; end;  For the function and procedure ToNumber in the chapter_13 package with the following  signatures:   function ToNumber    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2    return number;    procedure ToNumber    aiv_varchar2 in varchar2,  aon_number out number  ;  the callable statement strings are:  begin ? := chapter_13.tonumber  ?  ; end;    begin chapter_13.tonumber  ?, ?  ; end;  Now that you know how to formulate a stored procedure, callable-statement string literal, let's  look at how to use these string literals when creating a CallableStatement object.   13.2.2 Creating a CallableStatement    To create a CallableStatement object, use the Connection.prepareCall    method.  You need to pass it one parameter -- a string -- describing how the procedure or function is  invoked. For example:   CallableStatement cstmt = null;  try {   cstmt = conn.prepareCall "{ ? = call tonumberfun  ?   }" ;    . . .  }    In this example, the following string was passed as an argument to prepareCall   :   { ? = call tonumberfun  ?   }  Next, let's look at some possible errors that you might encounter when creating a  CallableStatement object.   13.2.3 Handling Errors  As with the Statement and PreparedStatement objects we have already covered, if there is  something wrong with your stored procedure, callable-statement syntax, the call to your  Connection object's prepareStatement    method will throw a SQLException. The most  common SQLException occurs when a procedure or function does not exist:   SQL Error: ORA-06550: line 1, column 13:  PLS-00201: identifier 'TONUMBERFUN' must be declared  ORA-06550: line 1, column 7:  PL SQL: Statement ignored  This error may come about because the procedure or function does not actually exist in the  database, or it could be that the username you are using when you call the stored procedure  does not have EXECUTE rights on the procedure.    After you create a CallableStatement object, you need to register any OUT parameters  before executing the statement. Next, let's see how you do that.   13.2.4 Registering OUT Parameters  In order to get the results from a stored procedure call, you must register any OUT or IN OUT  parameters before executing the CallableStatement. To do this, call the  CallableStatement object's registerOutParameter    method, passing it the position of  the placeholder character in the callable-statement string starting at 1 and moving from left to  right, just as you do for the other accessor methods, and a java.sql.Types constant to specify  the SQL data type that will be returned. There are two applicable signatures for the  registerOutParameter    method. For VARCHAR2 and DATE parameters, use the  following signature:   registerOutParameter    int parameterIndex,    int sqlType    throws SQLException  For NUMBER data types, you need to specify the scale of the number being returned, so use the  following registerOutParameter    signature:   registerOutParameter    int parameterIndex,    int sqlType,    int scale    throws SQLException    The scale in the second signature allows you to control the number of significant digits to the right  of the decimal point that are returned. To set the OUT parameter for our sample function,  ToNumberFun, shown earlier in Section 13.2.1.1, you can specify the following:   cstmt.registerOutParameter 1, Types.DOUBLE, 2 ;  You can determine the Types constant to use for a given OUT parameter by referring to Table  10-2. In this case, I used Types.DOUBLE, because it is one of the floating point Java data types.  After registering OUT parameters, continue by setting any IN parameters.   13.2.5 Setting IN Parameters   Setting IN or IN OUT parameters is done in a fashion similar to that used in Chapter 11 to set  parameters for prepared statements. You use the setXXX    accessor methods, passing the  position of the placeholder character in the callable-statement string  starting from 1, counting  from left to right  along with an appropriate Java data type. When determining the ordinal position  of a parameter, start counting with the left-most placeholder and count each placeholder in the  statement until you get to the parameter that you are setting. Be sure to count each placeholder,  whether it is an IN, OUT, or IN OUT parameter. Let's look at an example. For the ToNumberFun  standalone function, the callable-statement string literal was:   { ? = call tonumberfun  ?   }  Therefore, an appropriately coded setXXX    method would be:   cstmt.setString 2, aString ;  But what if you need to set a parameter value to NULL? There is a special setXXX    method  for setting an IN parameter to NULL values.   13.2.6 Handling NULL Values  If you wish to set a parameter value to NULL, then you must use the setNull    method, which  has the following signature:   setNull int parameterIndex, int sqlType   sqlType is the appropriate java.sql.Types constant for the SQL data type of the parameter  in question. You can determine which Types constant to use by referring to Table 10-1.   13.2.7 Executing a Stored Procedure  After a CallableStatement has been created, any OUT parameters registered, and any IN  parameters set, you can execute the CallableStatement using its execute    method. For  example:   cstmt.execute    ;  You can use the CallableStatement object's executeUpdate    method to execute a  stored procedure, but you'll always get back a value of 1, meaning one row was affected, which  doesn't make much sense. You can ignore the value, but what is the sense of using a method  that returns a nonsensical value? When you execute the stored procedure, JDBC passes any of  the IN or IN OUT parameters you set to the database. In turn, the database returns any OUT or  IN OUT parameters to you via JDBC.   13.2.8 Getting OUT Parameter Values  To get the values from OUT or IN OUT parameters, use the getXXX    accessor methods  similar to how they were used with result sets in Chapter 10. This time, however, call the  getXXX    methods using a reference to the CallableStatement object. For example, to get    the returned value from the ToNumberFun function used in earlier examples, and to get that  return value as a double, use the following code:   double aNumber = cstmt.getDouble 1 ;  13.2.9 Putting It All Together  Now that we have gone through the entire process of executing a stored procedure, from  identifying its signature through getting the results, let's take a look at an example. The program  TestStoredProcedures, shown in Example 13-2, exercises our sample stored procedures --  ToNumberFun, ToNumberPrc, Chapter_13.ToNumber  the function , and  Chapter_13.ToNumber  the procedure  -- using both SQL92 escape syntax and Oracle syntax.  Before you try this example, make sure you have compiled the four aforementioned stored  procedures using the SCOTT user ID.    Example 13-2.

In the process     method, the program first allocates several local variables:   aNumber    A Double to hold the value returned from the stored procedure.    aString    start    end    cstmt    A String to hold the character representation of a number to be converted by the stored  procedure.    A long to hold the start time, used later to calculate the average execution time of the  stored procedures.    A second long to hold the completion time after all the stored procedures have been  executed. It will be used with start to calculate an average elapsed time in milliseconds  for each stored procedure call.    A CallableStatement object to execute the stored procedures.    Next, the program enters a try block where it prepares and executes the stored procedures  shown earlier using both the SQL92 escape syntax and the Oracle syntax.    Let's study the first stored procedure call in detail. The program creates a CallableStatement  object by calling the Connection object's prepareCall    method and passing a properly  formatted SQL92 syntax string. Next, it registers the OUT parameter for the stored function using  the CallableStatement object's register-OutParameter    method, passing it ordinal  position 1 and a java.sql.Types.DOUBLE constant. Then, it sets the second parameter, an IN  parameter, using the CallableStatement object's setString    method. Next, it executes  the stored procedure by calling the CallableStatement object's executeUpdate     method, capturing the return value of the method, which the program in turn reports to you via a  call to System.out.println   .  The program will always report that one row was affected.   The program then proceeds by getting the return value of the stored procedure using the  CallableStatement object's getDouble    method. Since the getDouble    method will  return 0.0 if the returned value from the stored procedure is NULL, the program then calls the  CallableStatement object's wasNull    method to determine whether to set aNumber to  null in order to correctly store the return value of the stored procedure. Finally, the program prints  the conversion result using the System.out.println    method.    The process of executing a stored procedure is followed seven more times to demonstrate that all  eight syntax strings work properly. Finally, the program records the end of the last stored  procedure and displays an average execution time on the screen.    Why did we compute an average execution time for the stored procedure calls? Because I want  you to be able to compare the performance of the different JDBC drivers with respect to stored  procedure calls. If you change the driver type from Thin to OCI, and run the program several  times, you'll see that the OCI driver is slightly faster. If the sample stored procedure transferred a  larger amount of data in each direction, you'd see an even larger difference in the performance of  the two drivers, with the OCI driver being as much as 50% faster.   13.3 CallableStatement Is an OracleCallableStatement    The CallableStatement object used in this chapter's examples is an interface. The full  interface name is java.sql.CallableStatement. This interface is implemented by  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleCallableStatement, which extends  oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement. This means that all the proprietary  methods that are available in OracleStatement and OraclePreparedStatement are also  available in Oracle-CallableStatement. The following is a list of the proprietary methods  available in OracleCallableStatement, all of which can throw a SQLException:   clearParameters      ARRAY getARRAY int parameterIndex   InputStream getAsciiStream int parameterIndex   BFILE getBFILE int parameterIndex   InputStream getBinaryStream int parameterIndex   BLOB getBLOB int parameterIndex   CHAR getCHAR int parameterIndex   CLOB getCLOB int parameterIndex   ResultSet getCursor int parameterIndex   Object getCustomDatum int parameterIndex, CustomDatumFactory factory    DATE getDATE int parameterIndex   NUMBER getNUMBER int parameterIndex   Datum getOracleObject int parameterIndex   RAW getRAW int parameterIndex   REF getREF int parameterIndex   ROWID getROWID int parameterIndex   STRUCT getSTRUCT int parameterIndex   InputStream getUnicodeStream int parameterIndex   registerOutParameter    int paramIndex, int sqlType, int scale, int maxLeng th    Part IV: Object-Relational SQL   We've now covered everything there is to know about using JDBC with relational  SQL. Our second and third options for how to use the database involve object- relational SQL. Object-relational SQL is the application of SQL to Oracle  database objects and forms the basis of the object portion of Oracle's object- relational features. In Part IV we'll cover the use of the Statement, ResultSet,  PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement Java objects with Oracle  database objects. So let's start our journey into object-relational SQL with an  overview of Oracle's object-relational technology.    Chapter 14. An Object-Relational SQL Example  Oracle documentation refers to Oracle8i's ability to store user-defined data types in the database  as object-relational SQL. I think this is quite appropriate. With Oracle you have the choice of  creating three different kinds of tables:       A traditional relational table using native SQL data types such as VARCHAR2, DATE,   and NUMBER.       A relational table with object columns. This type of table is a hybrid, using both native   SQL data types and user-defined data types.       An object table, which is defined solely based on a user-defined data type.    The best part of this architecture is that it's flexible enough to facilitate both relational SQL and  object-oriented development tools by providing both a relational view and an object view of the    same database. You can create object views against relational tables to create an object face to  a relational database or create object tables and access the column attributes as though they are  part of relational tables by using the TABLE operator. You can have your cake and eat it too!    In this chapter, we'll discuss the use of JDBC with database objects. We'll start by examining  object analysis and design but not from the traditional point of view. Instead, we'll look at how we  can transform our relational model from that shown in Chapter 8 into an object model. We'll then  look at how we can transform our relational database into an object database by implementing  object views on our relational data. We'll finish up by creating object tables to replace our  relational tables, and we'll use those object tables for examples in the chapters that follow.   14.1 From Relational Tables to Object Views  In Chapter 8, we discussed creating a demographic database for HR data. By the end of the  chapter we had gone through several evolutions with our analysis and had presented 11 entities.  We then created the DDL for five of the entities:   PERSON   PERSON_IDENTIFIER   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE   PERSON_LOCATION   LOCATION   We can now take these five entities and create object views to present our relational database as  an object-relational database. Seeing that we are now looking at the data from an object  perspective, we have two ways in which to implement an object solution. We can create object  views on top of our relational tables or transform our entities into object tables.   14.1.1 Transforming Entities into Objects   Recalling all the entities we identified in Chapter 8, we can first create object tables for  EMPLOYMENT STATUS, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, and POSITION. Then we can create  another object table for PERSON, folding into it the following intersection entities as nested tables  or varying arrays:   PERSON_EMPLOYMENT_STATUS   PERSON_LOCATION   PERSON_ORGANIZATION   PERSON_POSITION   PERSON_IDENTIFIER   Nested tables and varying arrays are both referred to as collections. Adding the five collections  listed here to a person object table would create a rather large person object that would need  to retrieve all related person data at one time. This may be desirable for you, the programmer, but  it will lead to poor application performance. It is much more advisable to fold only the  PERSON_IDENTIFIER entity into the person entity as a collection, creating a new PERSON  object table, because it is common to query for persons by their identifiers. This leaves the  intersection entities as separate object tables with the end result being that we are left with four  objects: PERSON, PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE, PERSON_LOCATION, and LOCATION.    Our next decision is whether to use references, or primary and foreign keys to enforce referential  integrity. Since there are some negative performance implications associated with using  references in object views, we'll use primary and foreign keys. With these decisions behind us,  let's move forward by creating object views for our four new objects.   14.1.2 Creating Object Views  To create an object view, follow these steps:     1.  Define an object type in which its attributes correspond to the column types of the   associated relational table.    2.   Identify a unique value from the underlying relational table to act as a reference value for  the rows.    3.  Create an object view to extract the data.   4.  Create INSTEAD OF triggers to make the view updateable.   We'll do this for the PERSON and PERSON_IDENTIFIER tables. As a reminder, the following is  the DDL for the PERSON and PERSON_IDENTIFIER tables introduced in Chapter 8:   create table PERSON    person_id            number        not null,  last_name            varchar2 30   not null,  first_name           varchar2 30   not null,  middle_name          varchar2 30 ,  birth_date           date          not null,  mothers_maiden_name  varchar2 30   not null      create table PERSON_IDENTIFIER    person_id   number        not null,  id          varchar2 30   not null,  id_type     varchar2 30   not null    14.1.2.1 Creating user-defined data types   Step 1 is to create a user-defined data type to represent the data from these two tables as an  object. We'll start with the PERSON_IDENTIFIER table. Here's the DDL to create a  corresponding user-defined data type:   create type PERSON_IDENTIFIER_typ as object    id          varchar2 30 ,  id_type     varchar2 30     Notice that we don't have the person_id in the type definition. That's because the person_id  will be implicit, because the identifiers are stored in the form of a nested table within the enclosing  person object. Next, we need to create a nested table type definition to transform the  PERSON_IDENTIFIER table into a collection for the person object. Here's the DDL to do that:   create type PERSON_IDENTIFIER_tab as   table  of   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_typ   Now that we have a collection type for the PERSON_IDENTIFIER table, we can define the  person type:   create type PERSON_typ as object    person_id            number,  last_name            varchar2 30 ,  first_name           varchar2 30 ,  middle_name          varchar2 30 ,  birth_date           date,  mothers_maiden_name  varchar2 30 ,  identifiers          person_identifier_tab,   map member function get_map return varchar2,  member function get_age return number,  member function get_age_on  aid_date in date   return number,   static function get_id  return number  ;         create type body PERSON_typ as  map member function get_map return varchar2 is  begin   return rpad  last_name, 30            rpad  first_name, 30            rpad  middle_name, 30            rpad  mothers_maiden_name,30            to_char  birth_date, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS'  ;  end get_map;    member function get_age return number is  begin   return trunc  months_between  SYSDATE, birth_date     12  ;   end get_age;     member function get_age_on  aid_date in date   return number is   begin   return trunc  months_between  aid_date, birth_date     12  ;   end get_age_on;     static function get_id  return number is  n_person_id number := 0;  begin   select person_seq.nextval into n_person_id from dual;    return n_person_id;  end get_id;    end;     We've added one static and three member methods to person_typ. I'll use these in the coming  chapters to demonstrate how to call a database object's methods.    14.1.2.2 Selecting a reference value   Now that we have defined types for the PERSON and PERSON_IDENTIFIER tables, we need to  decide which value to use for an object reference. An object reference acts as a unique identifier  for an object, just as a primary key acts as a unique identifier for a row in a relational table. Since  we're creating object views, and the column person_id is common to both tables, we'll use it for  the reference value.    If we were creating an object table, as we will do later in this chapter, we could choose between  using a unique value in the attribute of a user-defined data type or a reference. A reference is a  database-generated global unique identifier  GUID . My preference, even with object tables, is to  use an attribute as a primary key instead of a GUID, because you can create foreign key  constraints between object tables with a primary key.    14.1.2.3 Creating an object view   Now that we have all the necessary types defined and have selected a reference value, we can  move on to step 3, which is to create a view to extract the data from our two relational tables and  cast it to a person type object. Here's the object view:   create or replace view person_ov of   person_typ with object identifier  person_id   as   select person_id,         last_name,         first_name,           middle_name,         birth_date,         mothers_maiden_name,          cast             multiset               select i.id,                   i.id_type            from   person_identifier i            where  i.person_id = p.person_id   as           person_identifier_tab   as         identifiers  from   person p  In this object view, we select data from the PERSON table and use the CAST and MULTISET  keywords to transform the related values in the PERSON_IDENTIFER table into a  person_identifier_tab object. The MULTISET keyword is used because the result of the  subquery has multiple rows. The CAST keyword takes the values and creates a  person_identifier_typ object for each row, which in turn becomes elements of the  person_identifier_tab object. The result of a query against the person_ov object view is a  person_typ object for each PERSON row in the database. Each person_typ object includes  any related person_identifiers.   14.1.2.4 Creating INSTEAD OF triggers   At this point, we can retrieve data from the PERSON and PERSON_IDENTIFIER tables in the  form of a table of person_ov objects. However, if we need to insert, update, or delete objects,  we need to create INSTEAD OF triggers on person_ov. INSTEAD OF triggers encapsulate  insert, update, and delete logic for a view in the form of PL SQL or Java code. Example 14-1  shows the three INSTEAD OF triggers required for the PERSON table, and Example 14-2  shows the three required triggers for the nested PERSON_IDENTIFIER table. All six of these  INSTEAD OF triggers are required to make the person_ov object view updateable.    The first three triggers, shown in Example 14-1, are PERSON_OV_IOI, PERSON_OV_IOU,  and PERSON_OV_IOD. These triggers intercept inserts, updates, and deletes against the  person_ov object view and propagate them to the PERSON table instead.   Example 14-1. person_ov INSTEAD OF triggers for the PERSON table   create or replace trigger person_ov_ioi  instead of insert on      person_ov  for each row  declare  t_identifiers  person_identifier_tab;  begin     insert into person            PERSON_ID,                        LAST_NAME,                        FIRST_NAME,                       MIDDLE_NAME,                      BIRTH_DATE,                       MOTHERS_MAIDEN_NAME     values            :new.PERSON_ID,                        :new.LAST_NAME,                        :new.FIRST_NAME,                       :new.MIDDLE_NAME,                        :new.BIRTH_DATE,                       :new.MOTHERS_MAIDEN_NAME  ;     if :new.identifiers is not null then    t_identifiers := :new.identifiers;    for i in t_identifiers.first..t_identifiers.last loop      insert into person_identifier              PERSON_ID,            ID,            ID_TYPE       values              :new.PERSON_ID,            t_identifiers  i  .ID,            t_identifiers  i  .ID_TYPE  ;    end loop;   end if;    end;       create or replace trigger person_ov_iou  instead of update on      person_ov  for each row  declare  t_identifiers  person_identifier_tab;  begin     update person   set    PERSON_ID           = :new.PERSON_ID,                        LAST_NAME           = :new.LAST_NAME,                         FIRST_NAME          = :new.FIRST_NAME,                       MIDDLE_NAME         = :new.MIDDLE_NAME,                       BIRTH_DATE          = :new.BIRTH_DATE,                        MOTHERS_MAIDEN_NAME = :new.MOTHERS_MAIDEN_NAME     where  PERSON_ID           = :old.PERSON_ID;                           delete person_identifier   where  PERSON_ID           = :old.PERSON_ID;     if :new.identifiers is not null then    t_identifiers := :new.identifiers;    for i in t_identifiers.first..t_identifiers.last loop      insert into person_identifier              PERSON_ID,            ID,            ID_TYPE       values              :new.PERSON_ID,            t_identifiers  i  .ID,            t_identifiers  i  .ID_TYPE  ;    end loop;     end if;    end;         create or replace trigger person_ov_iod  instead of delete on      person_ov  for each row  declare  begin     delete person_identifier   where  PERSON_ID           = :old.PERSON_ID;     delete person   where  PERSON_ID           = :old.PERSON_ID;                           end;     The next three triggers, IDENTIFIERS_OF_PERSON_OV_IOI,  IDENTIFIERS_OF_PERSON_OV_IOU, and IDENTIFIERS_OF_PERSON_OV_IOD  shown in  Example 14-2  handle inserts, updates, and deletes against the PERSON_IDENTIFIER table,  respectively, which is represented by the nested table identifiers in person_ov. These are  used only when the identifiers attribute of the person_typ is the only attribute modified by  a SQL statement.    Example 14-2. person_ov INSTEAD OF triggers for the PERSON_IDENTIFIER table   create or replace trigger         identifiers_of_person_ov_ioi   instead of insert on nested table identifiers of person_ov   for each row  declare  begin     insert into person_identifier           PERSON_ID,         ID,         ID_TYPE     values           :parent.PERSON_ID,         :new.ID,         :new.ID_TYPE  ;    end;       create or replace trigger         identifiers_of_person_ov_iou   instead of update on nested table identifiers of person_ov   for each row  declare  begin     update person_identifier   set    ID        = :new.ID,          ID_TYPE   = :new.ID_TYPE   where  PERSON_ID = :parent.PERSON_ID   and    ID        = :old.ID   and    ID_TYPE   = :old.ID_TYPE;    end;         create or replace trigger         identifiers_of_person_ov_iod   instead of delete on nested table identifiers of person_ov  for each row  declare  begin     delete person_identifier   where  PERSON_ID = :parent.PERSON_ID   and    ID        = :old.ID   and    ID_TYPE   = :old.ID_TYPE;    end;     With our six INSTEAD OF triggers in place, we have a fully updateable object view, named  person_ov, for the PERSON and PERSON_IDENTIFIERS table. With the person_ov object  view, we can update the underlying tables with relational SQL or treat them as an object. Using  object views, you can migrate a legacy relational database to a relational-object database. While  creating an object view does not take much effort, writing the INSTEAD OF triggers to make the  view updateable takes a great deal of effort. The best solution for a new application is to create  object tables directly based on our user-defined data types. Object tables can be modified using  either relational SQL or object-relational SQL.   14.2 Object Tables  Now that you've seen the object view solution, let's examine the use of object tables. In this  section, we'll take the four example entities: person, location, person location, and person  identifier type, and create object tables to represent those entities as objects. We'll create the  user-defined database types, and the object tables to implement them, in order of the  dependence.    To begin, we create an object table corresponding to the person identifier type entity. First, we  need to define a type:   create type PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_typ as object    code           varchar2 30 ,  description    varchar2 80 ,  inactive_date  date       Now that we have the type definition, we create the person_identifier_type_ot object  table using the following DDL:   create table PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_ot of                PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_typ  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0      alter  table PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_ot add   constraint   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_ot_PK  primary key     code    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10 K next 10 K pctincrease 0      Notice that we also created a primary key constraint on the table using the code attribute.     Next, we define the location type:  create type LOCATION_typ as object    location_id          number,  parent_location_id   number,  code                 varchar2 30 ,  name                 varchar2 80 ,  start_date           date,  end_date             date,  map member function get_map return varchar2,  static function get_id  return number  ;     create type body LOCATION_typ as  map member function get_map return varchar2 is  begin   return rpad  code, 30            rpad  name, 80            to_char  start_date, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS'  ;  end get_map;    static function get_id  return number is  n_location_id number := 0;  begin   select location_seq.nextval into n_location_id from dual;   return n_location_id;  end get_id;    end;     And now that we have the location type, we create the location_ot object table using the  following DDL:   create table LOCATION_ot of                LOCATION_typ  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0      alter  table LOCATION_ot add   constraint   LOCATION_ot_PK  primary key   location_id    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10 K next 10 K pctincrease 0        create unique index LOCATION_ot_UK1  on                  LOCATION_ot    code,  name,  start_date    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0        drop   sequence LOCATION_ID     create sequence LOCATION_ID    start with 1  order     This time we created a sequence to provide unique values for the primary key attribute  location_id. We also created a unique "external" key against the code, name, and  start_date attributes.    Now we need to create the person_ot object table, but to do so, we first need to define not only  the person type, but also the person_identifer type and the person_identifier  collection type. We can reuse the three types we defined for the person_ov object view, so  here's the DDL for the person_ot object table:   create table PERSON_ot of                PERSON_typ  nested table identifiers store as PERSON_IDENTIFIER_ot   tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0      alter  table PERSON_ot add   constraint   PERSON_ot_PK  primary key   person_id    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10 K next 10 K pctincrease 0        alter  table PERSON_IDENTIFIER_ot add   constraint   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_ot_PK  primary key     id,  id_type    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10 K next 10 K pctincrease 0        create unique index PERSON_ot_UK1  on                  PERSON_ot    last_name,  first_name,  birth_date,  mothers_maiden_name    tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0        drop   sequence PERSON_ID     create sequence PERSON_ID  start with 1  order     Here, we not only created a nested table but also created a primary key constraint on it to prevent  duplicate values in the collection. In addition, we created a unique index, person_ot_uk1, on  the attributes of the person_ot to prevent duplicate entries based on real-world values.     Now that we have a location_ot object table and a person_ot object table, we can create  the intersection entity person location. First, we define a type:   create type PERSON_LOCATION_typ as object    person_id     number,  location_id   number,  start_date    date,  end_date      date       For this type, we used the attributes person_id and location_id to act as foreign keys to  person_ot and location_ot, respectively. Had we not defined primary keys on person_ot  and location_ot, we could just as well have used object references to link occurrences of  person_location_typ to person_ot and location_ot objects. The primary key approach  to uniquely identifying an object is actually more loosely coupled than the use of a global unique  identifier  GUID  object reference. As a result, the primary key approach is more adaptable for  decision support activities such as reporting, because it allows you to continue to use the tables  as though they are relational and doesn't force you to follow the object references to establish  relationships. In addition, the use of primary keys also allows the use of foreign keys, which  prevents dangling references that can occur when using GUID object references.    Finally, here's the DDL for the person_location_ot object table:   create table PERSON_LOCATION_ot of                PERSON_LOCATION_typ  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 100 K next 100 K pctincrease 0      alter  table PERSON_LOCATION_ot add   constraint   PERSON_LOCATION_ot_PK  primary key     person_id,  start_date    using index  tablespace USERS pctfree 20  storage  initial 10 K next 10 K pctincrease 0      Table 14-1 shows the migration from relational tables to object views to the object tables  outlined in this chapter. At this point, we've defined four object tables, which we'll use as a basis  for our object-relational SQL manipulations using JDBC in the next two chapters. Chapter 15 will  cover the use of the weakly typed data types for manipulating object data. Chapter 16 will cover  the use of the strongly typed interfaces.    Table 14-1.

Weakly Typed Object SQL  Weakly typed object SQL refers to the use of structures, arrays, and references to insert, update,  delete, and select SQL objects. A structure refers to a structured SQL data type, which is a user- defined SQL data type synonymous with a Java class. An array refers to a SQL ARRAY, and a  reference refers to a SQL REF. These SQL data types are represented in JDBC by the  java.sql.Struct, java.sql.Array, and java.sql.Ref interfaces. A Struct is a JDBC  object that retrieves a database object. It represents the locator for a structured SQL data type, or  database object, in your Java program. After retrieving a database object with a Struct, you  retrieve the object's attributes by calling its getAttributes    method, which returns a Java  Object array. Since the attributes are returned as an Object array, it's up to you, the  programmer, to properly cast each object value as it is used. Hence, a Struct is weakly typed.  If, in turn, an attribute of the Struct represents another structured SQL data type, or database  object, then that attribute must itself be cast to the Struct. Likewise, if the attribute of a Struct  is an array of values, such as an Oracle varying array or nested table, then you must cast that  attribute to another JDBC object type, an Array.    Similar to a Struct, an Array represents the locator for a SQL ARRAY. It has a method,  getArray   , which returns the database array values as a Java Object array. If an element  of the returned Object array is a singleton value, that is, not a structured SQL data type, then  the element is cast to a standard Java data type. Otherwise, if an element is a database object,  then it must be cast to a Struct. Yes, it can get confusing, but given these two JDBC object  types, you can retrieve any type of database object value.    On the other hand, a Ref is used differently. A Ref object allows you to retrieve a unique  identifier for a given object from the database. If you decide to use your Oracle database with  loosely coupled relationships, you can store a reference from one object table in the attribute of  another object table, replacing the need for primary and foreign keys. I call this loosely coupled,  because you can't enforce references as you can foreign keys, so you can end up with dangling  refs, as they are called, which point to a row that no longer exists. Hmmm, shades of Oracle  Version 6? For this reason, I like to use primary and foreign keys. You can also use the Oracle  implementation of the Ref interface, REF, to get and set object values.    Now that you have the big picture, we'll take a look at how to use each object type. We'll cover  the use of the standard JDBC interfaces, java.sql.Struct, java.sql.Array, and  java.sql.Ref, along with the Oracle implementations: oracle.sql.STRUCT and  oracle.sql.StructDescriptor, oracle.sql.ARRAY, oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor,  and oracle.sql.REF.    Keep in mind that I am assuming that you've read the earlier chapters, so you're already familiar  with the use of the Statement, PreparedStatement, and ResultSet objects. Also, we'll  discuss how to insert, select, update, and delete database objects using these interfaces. Before  we get started with all that, I'll digress and take a moment to look at another alternative,  accessing object tables as relational tables, and the reasons why we will not cover this alternative  in any great detail.   15.1 Accessing Objects as Relational Tables  Oracle enriches the SQL language to allow you to manipulate object tables as though they are  good, old-fashioned relational tables. For example, you can insert an entry into person_ot with  the following SQL statement:   insert into person_ot values    person_typ     person_id.nextval,      'Doe',    'John',    'W',    to_date '19800101','YYYYMMDD' ,    'Yew',    person_identifier_tab     person_identifier_typ  'CA123456789', 'SDL'  ,    person_identifier_typ  '001019999',   'SSN'              The only difference between this SQL and the SQL you'd use to insert a row into a relational table  is that you need to use the constructors for the database types to create the appropriate objects.  But, if you remember our discussion of the Statement object in Chapter 9, building the  appropriate SQL statements to dynamically insert object data in this way can be quite  complicated and fraught with troubles. Besides, this is really not the kind of update methodology  we are trying to accomplish with object SQL. We want to insert, update, and select objects as if  we're using object-oriented technology! So, to that end, we won't cover how to update object  tables or select data from them using the TABLE keyword, etc. Instead, we will concentrate on a  methodology with which we can take a Java object and insert it into the database, update it, or  select it from the database. In this chapter, we'll concentrate on the weakly typed solutions for  doing this. Let's begin our journey into the weakly typed objects with the Struct object.   15.2 Structs  You use a java.sql.Struct object to insert object data into the database, update it, or select  object data from the database. A Struct object represents a database object as a record of  Object attributes. If the database object consists of objects within objects, then a given attribute  that represents another database object type will itself need to be cast to another Struct for as  many levels as are needed to resolve all the attributes. Let's start our detailed look at using a  Struct with inserting object values into the database.   15.2.1 Inserting Object Values  There are four steps to inserting an object into the database using a Struct object:    1.  Create an oracle.sql.StructDescriptor object for the database data type.    2.  Create a Java Object array with the same number of elements as there are attributes in   the database data type and populate it with Java objects of the appropriate data type.    3.  Create a Struct object using the oracle.sql.STRUCT constructor, passing the   appropriate StructDescriptor, Connection, and Object array of objects.    4.  Use a PreparedStatement object and its setObject    method to insert the data   represented by the Struct object into the database.    Let's look at these steps in detail.    15.2.1.1 Creating a StructDescriptor   The java.sql.Struct interface, being rather new, supports only selecting objects from a  database into a Struct object. The interface does not support creating a Struct object in a  Java program and using it to store the data it in the database. The missing functionality, that is,  the ability to create a new Struct object to hold a Java object's data and to use that Struct  object to update the database, is up to the JDBC driver vendor to implement. In Oracle's case,  two classes are used to create a Struct object. The first is oracle.sql.StructDescriptor.    You pass a StructDescriptor for a particular database type into the constructor for an  oracle.sql.STRUCT to create a Struct object for the desired type. To create a  StructDescriptor object, call the Struct-Descriptor factory method  createDescriptor   . Here's the method's signature:   StructDescriptor createDescriptor String databaseType, Connection conn    which breaks down as:  databaseType    The name of a user-defined data type in the database   conn    A valid database connection for the database containing the user-defined data type    For example, to create a new descriptor for person_ot, which is based on the type  person_typ, use the following code:[1]    [1] Since you're working with the Oracle classes, you need to add the import statement, import  oracle.sql.*;, to your program.   StructDescriptor personSD =   StructDescriptor.createDescriptor "SCOTT.PERSON_TYP", conn ;       Notice that the database data type, not the table name, is  specified when creating the StructDescriptor. I mention  this here because using the table name instead of the type  name is a common mistake.       15.2.1.2 Creating an Object array   In creating a Struct object, in addition to a StructDescriptor object, you need to pass the  oracle.sql.STRUCT object's constructor a Java Object array. This Object array must be  populated with the appropriate Java objects that correspond sequentially with the attributes of the  user-defined SQL data type defined by the StructDescriptor object. For example,  person_ot, which is based on the user-defined SQL data type, person_typ, has seven  attributes. So we create an Object array with seven elements:   Object[] attributes = new Object[7];  Since Java arrays start with an index of zero, the elements of the Object array attributes  map to the attributes of person_typ, as shown in Table 15-1.    Table 15-1. Java Object array to person_typ mappings    Array index   person_typ attribute   SQLtype   Java type   0   1   2   3   4   person_id   last_name   first_name   middle_name   birth_date   NUMBER   BigDecimal   VARCHAR2   VARCHAR2   VARCHAR2   String   String   String   DATE   Timestamp    5   6   mothers_maiden_name   identifiers   VARCHAR2   ARRAY   String   Array   Now that we have an Object array, we populate it with appropriate values:   attributes[0] = new BigDecimal 1 ;  attributes[1] = "O'Reilly";  attributes[2] = "Tim";  attributes[3] = null;  attributes[4] = Timestamp.valueOf "1972-03-17 00:00:00.0" ;  attributes[5] = "Idunno";  attributes[6] = null;  Notice that an Object array can be populated only with Java objects, not with primary data  types. So if you use a primary data type such as long in your program, you have to use the  wrapper class Long if you want to add its value to an Object array.    In the example, we've set the identifiers attribute to null for now, because we have yet to discuss  the Array object. But don't worry -- we'll cover the Array object later in this chapter.   15.2.1.3 Creating a Struct object   Once you have a StructDescriptor and an Object array with the attributes for the new  Struct, you can create a new Struct object for the corresponding type by using the new  operator with the oracle.sql.STRUCT constructor, which has the following signature:   oracle.sql.STRUCT oracle.sql.STRUCT    StructDescriptor structDescriptor,    Connection connection,    Object[] attributes   For example, to create a Struct for person_ot, use the following code:   oracle.sql.STRUCT person =   new oracle.sql.STRUCT personSD, conn, attributes ;  15.2.1.4 Inserting a Struct using java.sql.PreparedStatement   Now that we have the Struct named person, we can use the PreparedStatement object  and its setObject    method to insert the value into the database:   PreparedStatement pstmt =   conn.prepareStatement "insert into person_ot values   ?  " ;   pstmt.setObject 1, person, Types.STRUCT ;  int rows = pstmt.executeUpdate    ;  We used the Types constant STRUCT as the third argument to the setObject    method so it  would know that we were passing it a Struct object.    Once you have an object stored in the database, you'll most likely want to select or update it. To  update an object, you first need to retrieve a copy of the object, so let's cover selecting an object  next.   15.2.2 Retrieving Object Values  There are actually two ways you can retrieve object values as objects from a database. You can  get an object by using the value    database function or you can get a reference by using the    ref    database function and then use the REF object's getValue    method. We'll cover the  first method here and the second later on when we cover the Ref interface.   15.2.2.1 Formulating a SELECT statement   To retrieve objects from the database, you need to formulate a SELECT statement that uses the  value    database function. The value    database function has the following signature:   value  table_alias in varchar2    Since the value    function requires a table alias, you need to add a table alias after your table  list in your SELECT statement. For example, to select an object  the row , not columns, from  person_ot, use the SELECT statement:   select value p  from person_ot p  The table name alias, p, is passed as a parameter to the value    database function to get the  object value for a row rather than column values. Some documentation may state that you can  use the following SELECT statement:   select * from person_ot  But it simply will not work. You must use the value    database function with a table alias.       When using object SQL it's important to get into the habit of  using table aliases for every table and prefixing every column  name with an alias. This is because with object SQL, you use  dot notation to reference nested columns, so the SQL parser  requires an alias to qualify your column names.       15.2.2.2 Retrieving an object value as a Struct   When you use the value    database function, use the ResultSet object's getObject     method and cast the returned object to a Struct:   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;  ResultSet rslt = stmt.executeQuery    "select value p  from person_ot " +    "where last_name = 'O''Reilly' and first_name = 'Tim'" ;   rslt.next    ;  Struct person =  Struct rslt.getObject 1 ;  Then, to get to the attributes of the database object, use the Struct object's getAttributes     method, which returns the attributes as a Java Object array.   15.2.2.3 Casting the returned object attributes   To use the objects returned by getAttributes   , cast them as needed to the appropriate  Java type. Valid SQL to Java type mappings can be found in Table 10-1. For example, to get a  person's objects attributes, use the following code:   Object[] attributes          = person.getAttributes    ;   BigDecimal personId          =  BigDecimal attributes[0];   String     lastName          =  String attributes[1];   String     firstName         =  String attributes[2];  String     middleName        =  String attributes[3];   Timestamp  birthDate         =  Timestamp attributes[4];   String     mothersMaidenName =  String attributes[5];     At this point, you know how to insert an object and how to retrieve it. Next, let's see how to  update it.   15.2.3 Updating Object Values  When it comes to updating object values, there are once again two approaches you can take.  The first is to use a Struct object, and the second is to use a Ref object. To update the  database using a Struct object, there are five steps you must follow:    1.  Retrieve the database object's value into a Struct.    2.  Place the Struct object's attributes into an Object array.    3.  Modify the desired attributes in the Object array.   4.  Get the StructDescriptor object from the original Struct object.    5.  Create a new Struct using the StructDescriptor and Object array.    6.  Use a PreparedStatement object and its setObject    method to update the   database.    Since we just performed steps 1 and 2 in the last section, we can move on to step 3, in which you  modify the desired attributes. In our example, change Tim O'Reilly's mother's maiden name to  "unknown":   attributes[5] = "unknown";  Next, in step 4, you can either create a StructDescriptor as we did in the section Section  15.2.1, or get the original Struct object's StructDescriptor using the  oracle.sql.STRUCT object's getStructDescriptor    method:   StructDescriptor personSD =   STRUCT person .getStructDescriptor      Then, in step 5, using the retrieved StructDescriptor and modified Object array, create a  new Struct object with the modified attributes:   person = new oracle.sql.STRUCT personSD, conn, attributes ;   Finally, in step 6, use a PreparedStatement object to update the value:   PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement    "update person_ot p set value p  = ? " +    "where last_name = 'Doe' and first_name = 'John'" ;   pstmt.setObject 1, person ;  int rows = pstmt.executeUpdate    ;  As you can see, updating an object is a fairly simple process but can be somewhat tedious,  because you have to get an object, get its attributes, modify its attributes, recreate the object, and  then update the database with it, instead of just updating the attributes in place, as you would if  they were columns in a relational table. For example, you could have used the following relational  SQL statement:   update person_ot  set    mothers_maiden_name = 'unknown'  where  last_name = 'O''Reilly' and first_name = 'Tim'   But using this statement would be treating an object table as a relational table, and what we're  trying to do here is understand how to manipulate objects. That's the trade-off of using an object  database instead of a relational database. When you work with objects, you retrieve, manipulate,  and store a complex structure with attributes rather than work with individual columns.     Now that we've inserted, selected, and updated database objects, all that's left is deleting them.  And that's as simple as a relational SQL DELETE statement.   15.2.4 Deleting Object Values  There is nothing special about deleting an object from an object table. You just need to identify  the desired object row to delete using the appropriate WHERE criteria. For example, to delete  Tim O'Reilly's person_ot row, use the following DELETE statement:   delete person_ot  where  last_name = 'O''Reilly' and first_name = 'Tim'   Couple the above statement with a Statement object, and the following Java code will delete  the desired row:   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;  int rows = stmt.executeUpdate    "delete person_ot " +   "where last_name = 'O''Reilly' and first_name = 'Tim'" ;   Now that you're an expert at using a Struct, we can turn our attention to person_ot attribute  number six, identifiers. I've been avoiding it because it is an Oracle collection or, more  precisely, a nested table, which requires the use of a java.sql.Array. So let's take a look at  the Array interface.   15.3 Arrays  A java.sql.Array is used as an object attribute of a Struct to store a Java array in or  retrieve one from a SQL ARRAY attribute. This means you'll use an Array object to manipulate  Oracle collections: varying arrays  VARRAYs  or nested tables.    An Array can represent an array of a single predefined data type such as String. For example,  if you have an array of String objects, you can store them as an Oracle collection. Using the  default mapping, Oracle will convert the array of Strings into a collection of VARCHAR2s. An  Array can also store an array of objects -- for example, a PersonIdentifier object that has  two attributes, an id, and an id_type.    If you wish to store an array of Java objects such as PersonIdentifier as a collection of  database objects, you first have to convert the Java objects themselves into Struct objects and  then create a new Array by passing the array of Struct objects to the constructor of the  Array. This is because a database object, whether it's a table row, column, or part of a  collection, is represented by a Struct object.    Just like its weakly typed counterpart Struct, java.sql.Array is an interface that defines how  to materialize a SQL ARRAY from a database, but it is up to the database vendor to provide the  functionality to be able to create new Array objects in a Java program. And, in a similar fashion,  you use oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor to create an Array, just as you used a  StructDescriptor to create a Struct. Let's look at how you create a java.sql.Array.   15.3.1 Creating an Array  There are three steps to creating an Array:    1.  Create an ArrayDescriptor object for the database collection type.    2.  Create a Java Object array to hold the values of an appropriate data type for a   database collection type.     3.  Create an Array object using the oracle.sql.ARRAY constructor, passing an   appropriate ArrayDescriptor object, connection, and Java Object array.    Let's take a look at these steps in detail.    15.3.1.1 Creating an ArrayDescriptor   The first step in creating an Array object is to create an oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor  object for the Oracle database collection type. The distinction here, that you are creating an  ArrayDescriptor object for a collection type, is critical. If you define a person_identifier  type as:   create type PERSON_IDENTIFIER_typ as object    id          varchar2 30 ,  id_type     varchar2 30        you then need to define a collection type as a varying array or nested table to hold an array of this  database type. For example, you can define a nested table type as:   create type PERSON_IDENTIFIER_tab as   table  of   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_typ      Then, when you specify the collection type to create the ArrayDescriptor, you must specify  the name person_identifier_tab  the collection type , not person_identifier_typ  the  object type .    An ArrayDescriptor is created using the oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor factory method  createDescriptor   , which has the following signature:   ArrayDescriptor createDescriptor    String databaseCollectionType,    Connection conn   This breaks down as:  databaseCollectionType    The user-defined collection type   conn    A valid connection to a database that contains the specified collection type definition    So, to create an ArrayDescriptor object for person_identifier_tab, use the following  code:   ArrayDescriptor personIdentifierAD =   ArrayDescriptor.createDescriptor "PERSON_IDENTIFIER _TAB", conn ;  15.3.1.2 Creating an Object array   Now that you have an ArrayDescriptor object, you can move on to step 2, which is to create  a Java array of the appropriate type. In this example, you need to create an array of Struct  objects, because the underlying database type for the collection is an object type,  person_identifier_typ. This is where the use of Struct and Array objects can get  confusing. So let's take a moment to review the relationships between the person_ot attributes.    person_ot is an object table based on type person_typ. person_typ itself has seven  attributes. The first six attributes are built-in SQL data types. The last attribute, identifiers, is  an Oracle nested table represented as a SQL ARRAY. The identifiers attribute is based on    type person_identifier_tab. This is the type used for the array descriptor. The underlying  type for the elements of type person_identifier_tab is type person_identifier_typ.  So the Struct objects you create to hold the values for the identifiers must use a structure  descriptor based on type person_identifier_typ. For example, to create an Object array  for three identifiers, code something like this:      You need a StructDescriptor for the collection's       underlying database object type  StructDescriptor identifiersSD =   StructDescriptor.createDescriptor "SCOTT.PERSON_IDENTIFIERS_TYP",  conn ;       You need three collection entries  Object[] identifiersStructs = new Object[3];        two attributes in person_identifier_typ  Object[] identifiersAttributes = new Object[2];       Populate the identifier attributes  identifiersAttributes[0] = "1000000";  identifiersAttributes[1] = "Employee Id";       Create a Struct to mirror an identifier entry     and add it to the Array's object array  identifiersStructs[0] =   new oracle.sql.STRUCT identifiersSD, conn, identifiersAttributes  ;        Add a second identifier  identifiersAttributes[0] = "CA9999999999";  identifiersAttributes[1] = "State Driver's License Number";   identifiersStructs[1] =    new oracle.sql.STRUCT identifiersSD, conn, identifiersAttributes  ;       Add a third identifier  identifiersAttributes[0] = "001010001";  identifiersAttributes[1] = "Social Security Number";   identifiersStructs[2] =    new oracle.sql.STRUCT identifiersSD, conn, identifiersAttributes  ;   At this point, you have the array you need, so you can proceed to step 3, which is to create an  Array.   15.3.1.3 Creating an Array object   The Struct objects created to represent identifiers are then gathered into a Java Object array  and passed to the oracle.sql.ARRAY object's constructor along with an ArrayDescriptor  object created using the collection type person_identifier_tab. This creates a new Array  for the identifiers attribute. You create a new Array by using the new operator with the  oracle.sql.ARRAY, which has the following signature:   oracle.sql.ARRAY oracle.sql.ARRAY    ArrayDescriptor arrayDescriptor,    Connection conn,    Object[] objects   This breaks down as:  arrayDescriptor     An ArrayDescriptor object for the desired collection type    A valid connection to a database containing the specified database type    conn    objects    A Java object array containing the values for the collection   Pass the constructor, the appropriate ArrayDescriptor, Connection, and the Java Object  array:      now create the Array   Array identifiers =    new oracle.sql.ARRAY identifiersAD, conn, identifiersStructs  ;         update the person Struct  personAttributes[6] = identifiers;  And, as in the previous example, you then use the newly created array as an attribute assignment  for a Struct. Now that we've covered the Struct and Array interfaces, it's time to address the  Ref interface.   15.4 Refs  A java.sql.Ref is an object that holds a reference to a database object. Depending on how  you implement your Oracle objects, a Ref may hold a global unique identifier  GUID  or a primary  key column, and may also contain a ROWID. But what it contains is moot. It's how you use a Ref  that's important. A Ref object is simply an address to a database object. With it, you can retrieve,  or materialize, an object value. And with Oracle's implementation, oracle.sql.REF, you can  also update a value. But you can't create a new database reference in your Java program. That  simply doesn't make any sense. Since a reference points to a location of an object in the  database, the database has to create a reference when an object is inserted, and then you must  retrieve the newly created object's reference into a Ref object, similar to how we handled a Blob  or Clob in Chapter 12.    References can also be stored as attributes in other database objects to establish relationships  between objects. In this chapter, we'll cover how to retrieve a reference into a Ref object, how to  use it to materialize an object value, and finally, how to use it to update a database object. So  let's start with retrieving a reference.   15.4.1 Retrieving a Reference  To retrieve a reference from a database, use the ref    database function. Do you remember  how you used the value    function? Well, you use the ref    database function the same  way. You use it in a SELECT statement, passing it an alias for a table name. For example, to  select a reference to an object row in person_ot, use the following SQL statement:   select ref p  from person_ot p  To get a reference to the object row that contains Tim O'Reilly's information, use the following  code:   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;  ResultSet rslt = stmt.executeQuery    "select ref p  from person_ot " +    "where last_name = 'O''Reilly' and first_name = 'Tim'" ;  rslt.next    ;  java.sql.Ref personRef = rslt.getRef 1 ;    Notice that there's a specific accessor method for a Ref object, getRef   . Once you have a  Ref object, you can use it in an assignment to another table's row attribute, or you can  materialize the object value.   15.4.2 Materializing Object Values Using a Ref  If you have a reference to a database row object in a Ref object, retrieving the database object is  simple when using the oracle.sql.REF method getValue   . All that is required is to cast  the java.sql.Ref to an oracle.sql.REF in order to call the function:   Struct person =  Struct   oracle.sql.REF personRef .getValue    ;   Now you have both a reference to the row object and its value. Using the Struct object you can  update one or more of its attributes and save the update to the database. To save the update,  use a PreparedStatement object as we did earlier. Or, since you have a Ref object, you can  cast that object to oracle.sql.REF and use the resulting REF object to save the update.   15.4.3 Updating Object Values Using a Ref  All you need to do to update a database object once you have a Ref object is to cast it to  oracle.sql.REF and then call its setValue    method. For example, after modifying and  reconstructing a person Struct object, use the following code to save your changes:     oracle.sql.REF personRef .setValue person ;  There's no need for a SQL statement to update an object when you use a reference, because the  REF interface uses the reference, which is a locator, to update the object directly. This is similar  to how BLOB and CLOB objects can be updated via their locators.    At this point, you've seen how we can select and update an object, but you can also delete a row  object using its Ref.   15.4.4 Deleting Object Values Using a Ref  If you have a reference to a row object in the form of a Ref object, then all you have to do to  delete the row is to use a PreparedStatement object, passing it the Ref in its WHERE clause.  So to delete Tim O'Reilly's row object using the Ref we retrieved earlier, you'd code something  like this:   PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement    "delete person_ot p where ref p  = ?" ;  pstmt.setObject 1, personRef ;  int rows = pstmt.executeUpdate    ;  In this example, we use the ref    database function to get the reference for the object rows in  person_ot and then compare them to the reference we set in the DELETE statement with the  setObject    method.    Now that you've seen how to insert, select, update, and delete row objects in a detailed, step-by- step fashion using the Struct, Array, and Ref interfaces, let's take a look at how to execute  database object methods.   15.5 Calling Object Methods  A database object can have two kinds of methods: static or member. The first, static, is just like a  static Java method, in that it can be called by using its type name, just as a static Java method is  called using its class name. For example, type person_typ, which has a static method    get_id    that returns the next person_id sequence value, can be called as a stored  procedure:   person_typ.get_id      To execute get_id   , use a callable statement, which we covered in Chapter 13. Although  using a callable statement to execute a static method is pretty straightforward, calling member  methods presents a new problem.    Member methods -- just like their public, nonstatic Java counterparts -- must be associated with  an instance of the object in order to be executed. But how do you get an instance of the object in  the database to execute its member method? Your first guess might be to use a reference, which  makes pretty good sense to me, too. But the functionality to execute a member method with a  reference doesn't exist yet. Instead, use the object value returned from the database value     function or the proprietary oracle.sql.REF object's getValue    method. In this case, that  object value is a Struct, and you pass that Struct as the first argument of the member  function or procedure. Pass it as the first argument even though it is not a visibly defined  parameter. The syntax is:   user_defined_type.method_name    self in user_defined_type   [, parameter_1 IN data_type   , ...   , parameter_n IN data_type]     which breaks down as:  user_defined_type    A database user-defined data type or object   The name of a member method for the user-defined data type   An object retrieved from the database -- in our case, a Struct object -- upon which the  member method is executed    method_name    self    parameter_1    parameter_n    data_type    The first parameter for the member method   The nth parameter for the member method   A SQL built-in or user-defined data type   For example, type person_typ has a member function get_age    that returns a person's  current age. The function get_age    has the following signature:   get_age return number  To execute the function, call it as a stored procedure:  person_typ.get_age self   Pass a Struct object that represents the object you retrieved from the database as the  person_typ self parameter. For example:   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;  ResultSet rslt = stmt.executeQuery "select value p  from person_ot p" ;     while  rslt.next      {   Struct person =  Struct rslt.getObject 1 ;   rslt.close    ;   rslt = null;   stmt.close    ;   stmt = null;   cstmt = conn.prepareCall "{ ? = call PERSON_TYP.get_age  ?   }" ;    cstmt.registerOutParameter 1, Types.NUMERIC ;      Pass the Struct person as the member SELF variable    cstmt.setObject 2, person ;    cstmt.execute    ;   System.out.println "age = " + new Long cstmt.getLong 1  .toString     ;    cstmt.close    ;   cstmt = null;  }  Notice in the previous example that even though the person_typ member method get_age     does not have any parameters in its definition, the Struct object, person, is passed as the first  argument, self.    Now you have a means to execute database object methods if you decide to use the Struct,  Array, and Ref interfaces. Let's put what we now know into a comprehensive example.   15.6 Putting It All Together  Example 15-1 puts all the concepts and short examples we've seen in this chapter into one  cohesive example. Here's the big picture: the TestStruct program starts by cleaning up any  rows left over from a prior execution. Then it adds a person and a location and ties them  together with a person_location entry so that there are foreign key constraints on the person  and location objects. Next, the program modifies the person object using both the  PreparedStatement object's setObject    method and the oracle.sql.REF object's  setValue    method. Finally, the program selects the person object and displays its contents.  Since the person object has a collection for identifiers, the example exercises not only  oracle.sql.STRUCT, but also oracle.sql.ARRAY. Let's continue by examining the  TestStruct program in detail.   Example 15-1.

The process    method starts by creating a series of int constants that  are used to identify the position of each database type's attribute in the array returned by the  Struct object's getAttributes    method. Of course, these constants are not required; they  are here only to keep us out of the trouble we could cause by not using the correct index for a  particular attribute. Next, the program allocates additional variables that will be shared by the  code that follows.    The program then proceeds by cleaning up any prior executions. This means it enters a try  block where a Statement object is created and used to execute three DELETE statements in  order to remove the rows the program is about to insert.    After deleting any previous work, the program goes to the first of three try blocks, in which data  will be inserted using a Struct object. The first of the three try blocks inserts an object into the  person_ot table. To insert a person, the program creates three descriptors. The first,  identifiersArrayDescriptor, is used to create an Array object with person identifiers.  The second, identifiersStructDescriptor, is used to create the Struct objects to hold  the person identifier values that in turn are used as input for the creation of the Array. And the  third, personStructDescriptor, is used to create the person Struct object to insert into  the database. Next, an Object array is created to hold seven attributes. Then, a  CallableStatement object is used to retrieve the next value from the person_id sequence  for a primary key value by calling the person_typ static method get_id   . The returned  sequence value is stored in a long, person_id and is assigned to the first attribute of the  person Struct. Then the remaining attributes of the Struct are assigned values using the  constants declared earlier as the attribute identifiers.    Two Struct objects and one Array object are created by the identifiers program. To do  this, the program creates two more Object arrays: one for two attributes and the second for two  elements. The array identifersAttributes is assigned an id and id_type values. Then  the array is used as input for an execution of the new operator with oracle.sql.STRUCT to  create a Struct object for PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYP. The newly created Struct object is  stored as an element in the identifiersStructs array. This process of creating an identifier  entry is repeated a second time. Now the identifiersStructs array holds two identifiers.  Next, to create an Array object, identifiersStructs is passed into an execution of the new  operator for oracle.sql.ARRAY.    Now that the Array, identifiers, exists, it is assigned to the person Struct as the seventh  attribute. Next, a PreparedStatement object is created to insert the Struct object into the  database, and the setObject    method is called, passing the Struct person along with the  Types.STRUCT constant. Finally, the prepared statement is executed using the  executeUpdate    method, which inserts the object into the person_ot object table.    In the next two try blocks, the same process is followed for a location_ot object and a  person_location_ot object. At this point, in the database, there is a person object, a  location object, and an intersection object  person_location  that tie the two together.  Now that a person exists, the program proceeds in the next try block by modifying the newly  inserted object using a Ref and the oracle.sql.REF object's setValue    method.     First, the program creates a Statement object to select the reference for the person from the  database using the ref    database function. The accessor method for the ResultSet,  getRef   , is used to retrieve the reference as a Ref, which is stored in the personRef  variable. Next, the person object is retrieved from the database and placed into the Struct  named person by casting personRef to an oracle.sql.REF and calling its getValue     method. Following that, the person Struct object's attributes are retrieved using its  getAttributes    method. An attribute is then changed, and the person Struct is once  again recreated using the oracle.sql.STRUCT constructor, as was done earlier when the row  was inserted. Now that a modified Struct exists, the object is once again updated in the  database by casting personRef to oracle.sql.REF and calling the setValue    method,  passing the person Struct object as a parameter. The next try block also updates the  person, but this time, it does so using a prepared statement.    Once again, the value for the person object is materialized using the getValue    method,  modified, and then reconstructed. However, a PreparedStatement object is used to update the  database. Pay close attention to the syntax used in the SQL statement:   update person_ot p set value p  = ? where ref p  = ?   The modified Struct, person, is used to set the value for the first placeholder. The previously  retrieved Ref, personRef, is set against the second placeholder, which compares the value to  the reference in the database. Accordingly, the program calls the setObject    method twice:  the first time with the person Struct and the second time with personRef. At this point, we  have inserted and modified the values in the database. The last try block selects the data and  displays it on the screen.    The program proceeds in the last try block by creating a Statement object and executing a  query that utilizes the value    database function to retrieve the row object from the database.  In the while loop for the ResultSet object's next    method, the program calls the  ResultSet object's getObject    method, casting the object to a Struct. Then an Object  array variable is created and populated with the return value of the Struct object's  getAttributes    method. Before the sixth attribute is encountered, a callable statement  executes the type person_typ.get_age    member method. Then a second call gets the  person's age on January 1, 1980. When the sixth attribute, identifiers, is encountered, it is  cast and assigned to the Array identifiers. Next, another Object array variable is created,  is named personIdentifiers, and is assigned the cast return value from the Array object's  getArray    method. Then, for each element in the personIdentifiers array, a new  Object array variable is created. Next, the personIdentifiers element is cast to a Struct,  whereupon the getAttriibutes    method is executed to return the Struct object's  attributes into the Object array. All of the returned attributes are echoed to the screen. After  displaying the person object's values on the screen, the program terminates.    As you can see from this example, using the weakly typed SQL objects, Struct and Array, can  be somewhat tedious. But if you're performing a data-processing-type task, they are more  efficient than their strongly typed counterparts, which we'll talk about in Chapter 16. There is one  thing that Struct, Array, and Ref did not allow us to do, and that is to call database object  methods. To do that, we had to use a callable statement. Before we move on to Chapter 16,  let's review Oracle's implementation of these weakly typed SQL objects.   15.7 Oracle's Implementations  The three JDBC interfaces we have examined in this chapter, java.sql.Struct,  java.sql.Array, and java.sql.Ref, are implemented by the Oracle classes  oracle.sql.STRUCT, oracle.sql.ARRAY, and oracle.sql.REF. In addition to the    standard interface implementations, Oracle has two descriptor classes,  oracle.sql.StructDescriptor and oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor, used in conjunction  with the STRUCT and ARRAY constructors to create new instances of the Struct and Array  classes. This section documents the Oracle proprietary classes for the descriptors and the  proprietary methods for all five classes.   15.7.1 ArrayDescriptor  The oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor class extends java.lang.Object. An  ArrayDescriptor object is input to the constructor for oracle.sql.ARRAY to create a new  instance of ARRAY. It defines the SQL ARRAY characteristics as they are specified in the  database. To create a new ArrayDescriptor, call the ArrayDescriptor class's  createDescriptor    factory method, passing a database type name as a String and  passing a Connection. The ArrayDescriptor class has the following constants:   TYPE_NESTED_TABLE  TYPE_VARRAY  The ArrayDescriptor class also has the following methods, all of which can throw a  SQLException:   static ArrayDescriptor createDescriptor String name, Connection conn    int getArrayType      String getBaseName      int getBaseType      long getMaxLength      String getName      15.7.2 ARRAY Implements Array  The oracle.sql.ARRAY class implements the java.sql.Array interface. An ARRAY not only  implements an Array, but is also used with an ArrayDescriptor to create a new Array  object in your Java program. Beyond the functionality defined by the java.sql.Array interface,  the Array class also has the following proprietary constructor and methods, all of which can  throw a SQLException:   ARRAY ARRAY ArrayDescriptor type, Connection conn, Object elements   OracleConnection getConnection      ArrayDescriptor getDescriptor      Datum[] getOracleArray      Object getOracleArray long index, int count   String getSQLTypeName      boolean isConvertibleTo Class jClass   int length      Object toJdbc      15.7.3 StructDescriptor  The oracle.sql.StructDescriptor class extends java.lang.Object. A  StructDescriptor is input to the constructor for oracle.sql.STRUCT to create a new  instance of Struct. It defines the characteristics of the data type in the database. To create a  new Struct-Descriptor, call the StructDescriptor classes' createDescriptor     factory method, passing it the database object type name as a String and passing a  Connection. The StructDescriptor class has the following methods, all of which can throw  a SQLException:   static StructDescriptor createDescriptor String name, Connection conn    int getLength        ResultSetMetaData getMetaData      String getName      15.7.4 STRUCT Implements Struct  The oracle.sql.STRUCT class implements the java.sql.Struct interface. A STRUCT not  only implements a Struct, but is also used along with a StructDescriptor object to create a  new Struct object in your Java program. Beyond the functionality defined by the  java.sql.Struct interface, the Struct class also has the following proprietary constructor  and methods, all of which can throw a SQLException:   STRUCT STRUCT StructDescriptor type, Connection conn, Object  attributes[]   OracleConnection getConnection      StructDescriptor getDescriptor      Datum[] getOracleAttributes      boolean isConvertibleTo Class jClass   Object toJdbc      15.7.5 REF Implements Ref  The oracle.sql.REF class implements the java.sql.Ref interface. A Ref is used as a  pointer to an object row in the database. Besides implementing the java.sql.Ref interface,  REF also has the following proprietary methods, all of which can throw a SQLException:   OracleConnection getConnection      StructDescriptor getDescriptor      STRUCT getSTRUCT      Object getValue      Object getValue Dictionary map   boolean isConvertibleTo Class jClass   void setValue Object value   Object toJdbc      Now you know how to use a Struct, Array, and Ref to insert objects into a database, update  objects, delete objects, and select objects from a database. So let's move on to Chapter 16,  where you'll learn to do the same with the strongly typed SQLData and CustomDatum interfaces.   Chapter 16. Strongly Typed Object SQL  Strongly typed object SQL refers to the use of client-side custom Java classes to manipulate  database-side SQL objects. The classes themselves are referred to as custom because a Java  class is created to mirror its database counterpart. To mirror database objects you can use one of  two approaches: the JDBC API's standard SQLData interface or Oracle's CustomDatum  interface. With the SQLData interface, a database object is represented as a custom Java class  that implements the SQLData interface; however, a collection is still represented by an Array  object, and a reference is still represented by a Ref object. With the Oracle CustomDatum  interface, a database object is represented as an Oracle custom class file that implements the  CustomDatum and CustomDatumFactory interfaces. Unlike the SQLData interface, The  CustomDatum interface supports all database object types, including references and collections.    For example, in Chapter 15 we used a Struct object to manipulate a database object, an  Array object for collections, and a Ref object to hold a database reference. With strongly typed  object SQL, you'll use a custom Java class to manipulate a database object, an Array object or  another custom Java class for a collection, and a Ref object or yet another custom Java class to  hold a database reference.     If you're concerned with portability, then you should use the SQLData interface. Otherwise, since  the SQLData interface currently doesn't provide support for collections and references, or if  you're performing a data-processing task, I'd use Oracle's CustomDatum interface.    In this chapter, we'll cover both the standard java.sql.SQLData and the Oracle  oracle.sql.CustomDatum interfaces. Before we do, we'll spend some time in the next section  covering how to use Oracle's JPublisher utility. JPublisher can be used to automatically generate  the custom Java classes for both the SQLData and CustomDatum interfaces. It's important to  take the time to read the next section because we use JPublisher throughout this chapter to  generate the custom Java classes for the examples.   16.1 JPublisher  Oracle's JPublisher utility queries the database for the database object types you specify, and  using the mapping options you specify, creates either a SQLData or a CustomDatum  implementation of a Java class for each SQL object. JPublisher itself is a Java program that has  a command-line interface. You specify its runtime parameters on the command line when you  execute the program, but all the command-line options must be listed on one line, and this is an  invitation for errors. Alternatively, instead of typing a long list of parameters on the command line,  you can execute JPublisher using properties and input files. We'll start by covering all the  command-line options, then discuss how most of them can be entered into a properties file,  continue with input file syntax, and finish up with an outline of how to use JPublisher to generate  a custom Java class.   16.1.1 Command-Line Options  Execute JPublisher by executing the jpub program at a host command prompt. Specify any  command-line options by using the following syntax:   -option_name=value  which breaks down as:  option_name    Refers to one of the valid command-line options   value          A valid value for the corresponding option_name    There should be no spaces following the switch character  - ,  nor around the equal sign  = .    Following are the options available for use with JPublisher along with descriptions of their  possible values. Default values are underlined.   -builtintypes={jdbcoracle}    Controls type mappings, such as the choice between standard Java classes such as  String and Oracle Java classes such as CHAR, for nonnumeric, non-LOB, nonuser- defined SQL or PL SQL data types    -case={lowermixedsameupper}    Controls how JPublisher translates database type names to Java class and attribute  names. lower, same, and upper are self-explanatory. For mixed, JPublisher uses the  Java naming convention, removing any underscore   _   or dollar sign  $  characters but    using their placement in the database type name to denote the beginning of different  words to support capitalization.    -dir=   directory_name    -driver=   driver_name    Controls where JPublisher writes the class files it generates. The default is the current  directory.    Controls which JDBC driver to use to access the database. The default is  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver.    -encoding=   encoding_character_set    Controls the character set encoding used when writing the class files. The default is the  value in the system property file.encoding.    -input=   input_filename    -lobtypes={jdbcoracle}    -methods={truefalsenamed}    Specifies the name of a mapping file. A mapping file allows you to specify the data type  mapping between SQL and Java in a file rather than on the command line.    Controls the data type mapping between SQL and Java for the BLOB and CLOB SQL  types.    Controls whether JPublisher creates wrappers for a database type's static and member  methods. When true or named, JPublisher creates .sqlj files as part of a CustomDatum  interface class. CustomDatum classes are created because the SQLData interface does  not provide a Connection object, which is required to make a stored procedure call,  while the CustomDatum classes using SQLJ provide the required Connection object.  When false, JPublisher creates .java files. Regardless, JPublisher always generates  .java files for a reference, varying array, or nested table type. If the value is named, then  only those methods listed in the input file are wrapped.    -numbertypes={bigdecimaljdbcobjectjdbcoracle}    Controls type mappings for the numeric types. The mapping types listed affect numeric  data types differently, so they require some additional explanation:   jdbc   Maps most numeric types to primitive Java types such as short, int, long, float,  double, etc. Choosing jdbc means you can't properly handle database NULL values in  your program!   objectjdbc   Maps the numeric types to corresponding Java wrapper classes such as Short,  Integer, Long, Float, Double, etc. This makes detecting database NULL values  feasible.   bigdecimal   Maps all numeric types to BigDecimal. Not too efficient, but it can handle any number  Oracle throws its way.   oracle   Maps all data types to their corresponding oracle.sql.* types and maps user-defined  types to CustomDatum. Very efficient, but not portable.    -omit_schema_names     Controls whether the schema name is used in the generated classes. The default is to  include the schema name.    -package=   java_package_name    -props=   properties_filename    Specifies a Java package name to be included in the generated classes.   Specifies the name of a properties file. A properties file allows you to specify the  command-line options covered in this section in a file that in turn is read by JPublisher.    -sql=   type_name:   super_class_name:   map_class_name   -sql=   type_name:   map_class_name    Specifies the name of a database object, an optional Java superclass name, and a Java  class name for which to generate class files. You can use this option multiple times to  specify multiple object types for which to generate classes:   type_name   Identifies the name of the database type. If you're going to extend a superclass, then use  the first format and specify a super_class_name that you will extend with a subclass:  the map_class_name.   super_class_name   The name of an intermediate class file that you will then extend.  map_class_name   The name that will be used in the type map. Note that the case you specify overrides any  other case settings.   -url=   database_url    Specifies the database URL. The default value is jdbc:oracle:oci8:@.    -user=   username    password    A username and password that have access to the database types for which you want to  generate classes. This information must be specified in order to use JPublisher.    -usertypes={jdbcoracle}    Controls mappings for user-defined types and determines whether the SQLData or  CustomDatum interface is implemented by the generated classes. Selecting jdbc  results in the use of the SQLData interface, while a value of oracle results in the use of  the CustomDatum interface.    All of the properties in the previous list, except for -props, can be specified in a properties file.  And for your sanity's sake, I hope you use one. To show you why I feel the way I do, I'll provide  an example of a JPublisher command where I specify the properties on the command line. If you  wish to create classes for the five object types introduced in Chapter 14 and wish for those  classes to use SQLData interface implementations, use the following command at the host's  command prompt:   jpub.exe -user=scott tiger -methods=false -builtintypes=jdbc - lobtypes=jdbc -  numbertypes=objectjdbc -usertypes=jdbc - sql=LOCATION_TYP:JLocation:Location -sql=   PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_TYP:PersonIdentifierType -sql=  PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYP:    PersonIdentifier -sql=PERSON_TYP:JPerson:Person - sql=PERSON_LOCATION_TYP:  PersonLocation   Rather confusing, isn't it? There's more than ample opportunity to make a mistake when typing,  isn't there? To better organize the process of generating custom classes using JPublisher, use a  properties file to hold all the command-line options except -props and -sql. For the -sql  property, use an input file. We'll examine both of these file types in the next two sections.   16.1.2 Property File Syntax  Instead of listing all the desired command-line options on the command line when you run  JPublisher, you can put them in a properties file and specify the properties filename on the  command line with the -props option. To enter options in a properties file, prefix them with  jpub.. For example, to specify the -user option, type the following into a text file:   jpub.user=scott tiger  For our earlier example, the contents of a properties file might look like this:   jpub.user=scott tiger  jpub.methods=false  jpub.builtintypes=jdbc  jpub.lobtypes=jdbc  jpub.numbertypes=objectjdbc  jpub.usertypes=jdbc  jpub.input=sqldata.input  Be warned that trailing spaces on your property values will make them invalid -- for example,  "jdbc " with a trailing space character, is not recognized, but jdbc is recognized. If you make the  mistake of leaving a trailing space character, you'll get an error message similar to this:   ERROR: Option -builtintypes=jdbc  is invalid  This error will drive you crazy trying to figure out what's wrong when your option setting looks  right.   16.1.3 Input File Syntax  Instead of specifying the database types to generate classes on the command line, as we did in  the earlier example, you can specify your class file generation options  those specified with the - sql option  in an input file that you in turn specify on the command line with the -input option.  Alternatively, you can specify the input file in the properties file with the jpub.input property.  An input file is a text file with the following syntax  items in brackets are optional :   SQL    [schema.]{type_name  package_name}  [GENERATE    [java_package_name.]java_super_class_name]  [AS    [java_package_name.]  java_map_class_name]  [TRANSLATE     member_name AS java_name  [,member_name AS java_name...]]  which breaks down as:   schema    The database object type's schema name.    type_name    package_name    The database object type's name.   The name of a database package.   java_package_name    GENERATE    java_super_class_name    The name of the Java package to include in a generated class.    A clause that determines the name of the class file that will be generated.    The name of the class generated with the expectation that the class will be extended by  java_map_class_name, which in turn will be manually coded by a programmer to  extend java_super_class_name. If the GENERATE clause is omitted, then the AS  clause's java_map_class_name is generated.    AS    java_map_class_name    A clause that determines the name of a subclass if the GENERATE clause is used or the  name of the generated class if the GENERATE clause is omitted.    The name of the class that will subclass the generated class file if the GENERATE clause  is used or the name of the class file that is generated if the GENERATE clause is omitted.  It's also the class name that is used when modifying the class map in your Java program   more on this later .    A clause that renames a type's static or member methods.    TRANSLATE    member_name    java_name    The name of a type method.   The name you wish to use for the method in the generated class.   16.1.4 Writing a Class That Extends a Generated Class  If you use the GENERATE clause, you need to write the subclass that will extend the superclass.  When you do, your subclass must:       Have a no argument constructor that calls the no argument constructor for the   superclass. For a CustomDatum class, you must also have a constructor that takes a  Connection object and passes it to the superclass, and you must have another  constructor that takes a ConnectionContext object and passes it to the superclass.            Implement the CustomDatum or SQLData interface. Your subclass activity does this  automatically by inheriting from its parent class.    Implement CustomDatumFactory if it's implementing the CustomDatum interface.    Now that you have some background on how JPublisher works, let's actually use it to generate a  SQLData class for the type person_typ.     16.2 The SQLData Interface  The java.sql.SQLData interface allows you to create custom Java classes that mirror your  user-defined database types. But, as my mother-in-law would say, "What do you get for that?" If  you haven't used an object database before, using a database to store objects, that is, both data  and methods, requires a shift in your thinking. Instead of just modeling the data around, and  establishing relationships between, different things, you can complete the puzzle by including a  thing's behavior. When you create a user-defined data type in the database, you can also include  methods for its behaviors. You can continue to use relational SQL and retrieve the object data as  though it were in tables, and execute object methods as though they were separate stored  procedures, but with the SQLData interface, you don't have to. Instead, you can create a Java  object that will mimic your database object and retrieve an object directly from the database into  your Java program as an object. There is no longer any need to do any relational-to-object  mapping in your Java program. Now you can use objects.    When you use SQLData, follow these steps:   1.  Create custom Java classes to represent database user-defined data types.    2.  Add the custom Java classes to the Connection object's type map.    3.  For insert and update operations, use a PreparedStatement object with an   appropriately formulated SQL statement.    4.  Use the getObject    or setObject    accessor methods to get and set the object   values as needed.    Since we will use JPublisher to write our custom Java classes, I will not go into any great detail  about hand-coding them. However, I will briefly talk about the process for doing that in the next  section.   16.2.1 Hand-Coding a SQLData Implementation  Writing your own SQLData classes is really not that difficult. The SQLData interface requires you  to implement three methods:   String getSQLTypeName      void readSQL SQLInput stream, String typeName   void writeSQL SQLOutput stream   The getSQLTypeName    method returns the database type name. The readSQL    method  uses the SQLInput stream that is passed to it from the JDBC driver to populate the attributes in  the custom Java class. For each attribute in the database type, the appropriate SQLInput object  readXXX    method is called in the same order as the attributes in the database type. For  example, let's take location_typ. It's defined as:   create type LOCATION_typ as object    location_id          number,  parent_location_id   number,  code                 varchar2 30 ,  name                 varchar2 80 ,  start_date           date,  end_date             date,  map member function get_map return varchar2,  static function get_id  return number  ;       Assuming that the class's variables are defined elsewhere in the class, a readSQL    method  for this type would look something like this:   public void readSQL SQLInput stream, String type    throws SQLException {    locationId       = stream.readBigDecimal    ;    parentLocationId = stream.readBigDecimal    ;    code             = stream.readString    ;    name             = stream.readString    ;    startDate        = stream.readTimestamp    ;    endDate          = stream.readTimestamp    ;  }  The writeSQL    method for the type, which writes the data back to the database, would look  something like this:   public void writeSQL SQLOutput stream    throws SQLException {    stream.writeBigDecimal locationId ;    stream.writeBigDecimal parentLocationId ;    stream.writeString code ;    stream.writeString name ;    stream.writeTimestamp startDate ;    stream.writeTimestamp endDate ;  }  If you want the custom Java class to be useful, give it a set of applicable accessor methods so it  follows the JavaBeans standard. Accordingly, for each attribute, create corresponding get and  set methods. Putting it all together, you have the following class definition:   import java.sql.*;    public class SQLDataLocation implements SQLData, Serializable {     private java.math.BigDecimal locationId;    private java.math.BigDecimal parentLocationId;    private String               code;    private String               name;    private java.sql.Timestamp   startDate;    private java.sql.Timestamp   endDate;         A no argument constructor    public SQLDataLocation     {    }      public void readSQL SQLInput stream, String type      throws SQLException {      locationId       = stream.readBigDecimal    ;      parentLocationId = stream.readBigDecimal    ;      code             = stream.readString    ;      name             = stream.readString    ;      startDate        = stream.readTimestamp    ;      endDate          = stream.readTimestamp    ;    }      public void writeSQL SQLOutput stream      throws SQLException {      stream.writeBigDecimal locationId ;      stream.writeBigDecimal parentLocationId ;      stream.writeString code ;        stream.writeString name ;      stream.writeTimestamp startDate ;      stream.writeTimestamp endDate ;    }      public String getSQLTypeName          throws SQLException {      return "SCOTT.LOCATION_TYP";    }      public java.math.BigDecimal getLocationId     {       return locationId;     }      public java.math.BigDecimal getParentLocationId     {        return parentLocationId;     }      public String getCode     {       return code;     }      public String getName     {       return name;     }      public java.sql.Timestamp getStartDate     {       return startDate;     }      public java.sql.Timestamp getEndDate     {       return endDate;     }      public void setLocationId java.math.BigDecimal locationId  {        this.locationId = locationId;     }      public void setParentLocationId java.math.BigDecimal paren tLocationId   {       this.parentLocationId = parentLocationId;     }      public void setCode String code  {       this.code = code;     }      public void setName String name  {       this.name = name;     }      public void setStartDate java.sql.Timestamp startDate   {       this.startDate = startDate;     }      public void setEndDate java.sql.Timestamp endDate  {        this.endDate = endDate;       }  }  But what if you have 100, or 500, or maybe even 1,000 types for which you need to create Java  classes? Manually coding the classes can be an onerous and unproductive task, especially when  you stop to consider that JPublisher can do the job for you.   16.2.2 Using JPublisher to Generate SQLData Classes  The process of creating custom Java classes for your database types with JPublisher is:    1.  Create database object types.   2.  Create a JPublisher mapping file, referred to as the input file.   3.  Create a JPublisher properties file that points to the mapping file.   4.  Execute JPublisher using the -props option.   5.  Compile any .sqlj files created by JPublisher in order of dependence.    6.  Compile any .java files created by JPublisher in order of dependence.    16.2.2.1 Creating database objects   We covered step 1, creating database objects, in Chapter 14. In that chapter, we created  several types, so we won't repeat that step here. We ended up creating six types for our  examples:   location_typ   person_identifier_type_typ   person_identifier_typ   person_identifier_tab   person_typ   person_location_typ   Let's proceed to step 2 and create a mapping file.   16.2.2.2 Creating a mapping file for SQLData   Of the six types mentioned previously, two, location_typ and person_typ, have methods.  Since the SQLData interface does not support database object methods, we need to create a  superclass using JPublisher and then later hand-code a subclass that implements their methods.  So for these two types, we use the GENERATE clause to create a superclass. Then later, we  create a subclass that implements JPublisher's generated class, which adds wrapper methods to  call the database type's methods. For the other four types, we simply use the AS clause. Here's  our mapping file, sqldata.input:   SQL LOCATION_TYP               GENERATE JLocation AS Location   SQL PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_TYP                    AS  PersonIdentifierType  SQL PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYP                         AS PersonIdentifier   SQL PERSON_TYP                 GENERATE JPerson   AS Person   SQL PERSON_LOCATION_TYP                           AS Perso nLocation  The first line instructs JPublisher to generate a superclass JLocation that will be extended by  the subclass Location from the database type LOCATION_TYP. Remember that although the  case of the database data type is not important, the case of the GENERATE and AS clause's class    names will be used in the classes themselves. The second line instructs JPublisher to generate  the PersonIdentifierType class from the database data type  PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_TYP. After executing JPublisher, you end up with five classes:  JLocation, PersonIdentifierType, PersonIdentifier, JPerson, and  PersonLocation. But what about the sixth type, PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TAB? When using the  SQLData interface, you'll use a java.sql.Array for Oracle collections, just as we did in  Chapter 15.    Now that we have the mapping, or input, file written, let's move on to the properties file.    16.2.2.3 Creating a properties file for SQLData   The properties file will allow you to list the properties you can pass on the command line in a text  file. Using a properties file ensures that you use the same properties when generating all your  classes. Here's the properties file sqldata.properties, which we'll use for generating the SQLData  classes:   jpub.user=scott tiger  jpub.methods=false  jpub.builtintypes=jdbc  jpub.lobtypes=jdbc  jpub.numbertypes=objectjdbc  jpub.usertypes=jdbc  jpub.input=sqldata.input  This breaks down as:  user    Specifies the username and password to use when logging into the database.    methods    builtintypes    lobtypes    numbertypes    usertypes    input    Set to false because JPublisher does not support the creation of wrapper methods for  the SQLData interface.    Set to jdbc, so java.sql.String is used instead of oracle.sql.CHAR, and so  forth.    Also set to jdbc to get the JDBC LOB types and not the Oracle LOB types.    Set to objectjdbc, so Java wrapper classes such as Integer and Double are used  instead of the Java primitives such as int and double.    This is critical and determines whether JPublisher generates SQLData or CustomDatum  classes. In this case, we specify jdbc to generate SQLData classes.    Specifies the name of the input file.   As stated earlier, you can specify all these values on the command line. However, a properties  file is a tidier approach.    16.2.2.4 Executing JPublisher    Now that you have an input and a properties file, you can generate the classes by executing  JPublisher with the following command at the command prompt:   jpub -props=sqldata.properties  Given the input and properties we created earlier, you now have five new class source files:   JLocation.java   PersonIdentifierType.java   PersonIdentifier.java   JPerson.java   PersonLocation.java   You'll need to compile these generated classes before you attempt to use them in another  program.    16.2.2.5 Examining JPublisher's output   Before we move on to using the classes generated by JPublisher, let's look at the source code  that JPublisher created for the superclass JLocation.java:   import java.sql.SQLException;  import oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleConnection;  import oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleTypes;  import java.sql.SQLData;  import java.sql.SQLInput;  import java.sql.SQLOutput;  import oracle.sql.STRUCT;  import oracle.jpub.runtime.MutableStruct;    public class JLocation implements SQLData  {    public static final String _SQL_NAME = "SCOTT.LOCATION_TYP";     public static final int _SQL_TYPECODE = OracleTypes.STRUCT;       private java.math.BigDecimal m_locationId;    private java.math.BigDecimal m_parentLocationId;    private String m_code;    private String m_name;    private java.sql.Timestamp m_startDate;    private java.sql.Timestamp m_endDate;       * constructor *     public JLocation        {    }      public void readSQL SQLInput stream, String type     throws SQLException    {        setLocationId stream.readBigDecimal     ;        setParentLocationId stream.readBigDecimal     ;         setCode stream.readString     ;        setName stream.readString     ;        setStartDate stream.readTimestamp     ;        setEndDate stream.readTimestamp     ;    }      public void writeSQL SQLOutput stream       throws SQLException    {        stream.writeBigDecimal getLocationId     ;        stream.writeBigDecimal getParentLocationId     ;         stream.writeString getCode     ;        stream.writeString getName     ;        stream.writeTimestamp getStartDate     ;        stream.writeTimestamp getEndDate     ;    }      public String getSQLTypeName     throws SQLException     {      return _SQL_NAME;    }       * accessor methods *     public java.math.BigDecimal getLocationId        { return m_locationId; }      public void setLocationId java.math.BigDecimal locationId      { m_locationId = locationId; }        public java.math.BigDecimal getParentLocationId         { return m_parentLocationId; }      public void setParentLocationId java.math.BigDecimal parentLocationId     { m_parentLocationId = parentLocationId; }        public String getCode        { return m_code; }      public void setCode String code     { m_code = code; }        public String getName        { return m_name; }      public void setName String name     { m_name = name; }        public java.sql.Timestamp getStartDate        { return m_startDate; }      public void setStartDate java.sql.Timestamp startDate      { m_startDate = startDate; }      public java.sql.Timestamp getEndDate        { return m_endDate; }      public void setEndDate java.sql.Timestamp endDate      { m_endDate = endDate; }    }    Overall, it's pretty similar to the SQLData interface code we hand-coded for type location_typ  earlier. Nothing earth-shattering. And that's my point. Why should you write this generic code  when your computer can do it for you? However, since the SQLData interface does not define  database object method support, and therefore, JPublisher does not support the creation of  wrappers for database object methods, you'll have to write some code after all. So let's take a  look at extending a superclass.    16.2.2.6 Extending a generated superclass   Now that we have the classes generated by JPublisher, we need to create the subclasses  Location and Person for JLocation and JPerson. Since the process is similar for both, and  person_typ has more methods, I'll cover the Person class here.    Reviewing the criteria that we covered earlier for extending a JPublisher class, all we need to do  in this instance is create a class that extends JPerson and has a no argument constructor that  calls its parent class's no argument constructor. Accordingly, here's a minimal subclass:   public class Person extends JPerson {      public Person     {       super    ;    }  }  But what good is it to subclass JPerson unless we add some functionality? In the case of  Person, we want to implement methods that call the member methods defined for person_typ  in the database. The following is our fully coded subclass with all of person_typ type's methods  implemented:   import java.math.*;  import java.sql.*;    public class Person extends JPerson {    private Connection conn = null;      public Person     {       super    ;    }         We've added a constructor that takes a connection so we         have one available to make stored-procedure calls    public Person Connection conn  {       super    ;      setConnection conn ;    }      public BigDecimal getId     throws SQLException {      BigDecimal id  = null;      if  conn!=null  {        Person thisPerson = this;        CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall          "{? = call " + getSQLTypeName     + ".GET_ID   }" ;         cstmt.registerOutParameter 1, Types.NUMERIC ;        cstmt.execute    ;        id = cstmt.getBigDecimal 1 ;      }      return id;    }         public Integer getAge     throws SQLException {      Integer age = null;      if  conn!=null  {        Person thisPerson = this;        CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall          "{? = call " + getSQLTypeName     + ".GET_AGE  ?  }" ;         cstmt.registerOutParameter 1, Types.NUMERIC ;        cstmt.setObject 2, thisPerson ;        cstmt.execute    ;        age = new Integer cstmt.getInt 1  ;      }      return age;    }       public Integer getAgeOn Timestamp date  throws SQLException {       Integer age = null;      if  conn!=null  {        Person thisPerson = this;        CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall          "{? = call " + getSQLTypeName     + ".GET_AGE_ON  ?, ?  }" ;         cstmt.registerOutParameter 1, Types.NUMERIC ;        cstmt.setObject 2, thisPerson ;        cstmt.setTimestamp 3, date ;        cstmt.execute    ;        age = new Integer cstmt.getInt 1  ;      }      return age;    }          We've also added a setter method to set the connection        so one is available for the stored-procedure calls    public void setConnection Connection conn  {      this.conn = conn;    }    }  The first thing of importance in this definition for a Person class is that we've added a private  variable conn to hold a Connection reference. Without a connection we can't execute the  stored procedures using a callable statement. In conjunction with conn, we've added a second  constructor that takes a Connection object as a parameter and stores it in conn, and we've  also added a setConnection    accessor method to set the connection. Now, when creating a  new Person instance, we can use the alternate constructor to set the connection:   Person person = new Person conn ;  Or, if we have retrieved a person from the database, we can call the setConnection     method to initialize the Connection in the Person instance.    The first method in the Person class is getId   . getId    is a wrapper method for the  person_typ type's static method GET_ID   . The static method GET_ID    returns the next  sequence value for the personId attribute. It's defined as static so that it is available when  there is no instance of type person_typ. Of course, it has to be this way, because the method is  used only when creating a new instance. Since GET_ID    is a static method, it's called using its  type name, person_typ. In our subclass, it has been implemented as an instance method, but it  could have just as easily been a static method if we were to recode it to accept a Connection    object. However, when we consider how it will be used, that is, to get the next ID value for the  personId attribute, there is no need to make it a static function in Java.    The next method, getAge   , is a wrapper class for the person_typ type's member method,  GET_AGE   . As defined in the database type, GET_AGE    has no arguments, yet we pass an  argument. So what's happening here? Since a member method requires an instance of its type in  order to be executed, each member method has an implied first argument appropriately called  SELF. What we're doing in getAge    is passing the Java this reference to the member  method as SELF.    The third method, getAgeOn   , is a wrapper class for the person_typ type's member method  GET_AGE_ON   . GET_AGE_ON    takes one argument, a DATE from which to calculate an age,  but this time, we pass two arguments! Once again, that's because we pass the this reference  as the implied first argument, SELF.    Notice that we've coded all three methods to fail silently if no Connection object is available by  testing the existence of the Connection variable, conn, with an if statement.    One question that begs to be asked as a result of all this discussion is why would anyone want to  execute methods in the database when they could possibly do so more efficiently in the client?  The next section attempts to answer this question.    16.2.2.7 Database versus client method execution   Why would anyone execute a method in the database instead of writing code to execute the  method on the client? Rather than take a one-sided stand, as the question implies, a better  approach is to ask: "Where is the best place to execute a type's method?" With the first method,  getId   , there is no way to get a sequence's next value more efficiently in a client, and yet  maintain control over how the sequence numbers are allocated, than in a database.  Consequently, using a static type  user-defined database type  method is the best choice.  However, using the member type methods getAge    and getAgeOn    instead of coding  these in the custom Java class is questionable.    If it is possible to implement a method in a client's invocation of an object with exactly the same  results that the database would produce, then the method in question can be coded in the Java  class. However, keep in mind that we are now using the database as persistent storage for  objects, not just for data. Any application that accesses the database should be able to use an  object's methods as well as its data. This is a drastic departure from traditional relational  database thinking. If a method is reproduced in another environment such as on the client, and  later the functionality of said method is changed in the database, then the database and client  implementations will be out-of-sync. On the other hand, if the method is wrapped and called from  the database, it can never be out-of-sync.    There seems to be this pervasive impression that calling stored procedures, or making remote  procedure calls, is inherently bad. Yet CORBA and Java, two of the most popular and growing  technologies, are built around the concept of remote object invocation. Be very thoughtful when  you decide how to implement database type methods in your Java classes.    Of course, there are always the no-brainer member methods, which perform a significant amount  of database processing. These are best done in the database because doing so eliminates the  network overhead involved in passing data back and forth between client and database.  Regardless, I recommend that you always create wrapper methods that call a database object's  methods in the database rather than attempt to recode those methods on the client. This allows  you to move your object model into the database where it belongs.   16.2.3 Adding Classes to a Type Map    Now that we have a JPublisher SQLData class for each database type, it's time to put them to  work. Unlike the built-in SQL data types, custom Java classes have no default SQL-to-Java data  type mapping supplied by the driver. Instead, you, as the programmer, must provide the required  mapping by adding your custom Java classes to a connection's type map. The type map for a  connection is usually a hash table that holds keyword value pairs, with the database object type  as the keyword and an empty instance of the custom Java class as the value.    After you provide an updated type map to your connection, use the getObject    and  setObject    accessor methods as you would with any built-in SQL data type accessor to get  and set values. When you add your custom Java classes to a connection's type map, a call to the  getObject    method returns an instance of an object of the Java type you specified, and a  call to setObject    expects an instance of the Java type you specified. If you don't update the  type map, a call to the getObject    method gives you its default object, a Struct, while a  call to a the setObject    methods expects a Struct. To add entries to a type map, follow  these steps:    1.  Get the existing type map from a Connection object.    2.  Add your custom Java objects to the type map.   3.  Replace the Connection object's current type map with the one you updated.    16.2.3.1 Getting an existing type map   When you first get a Connection object from DriverManager or from a DataSource object,  the default type map is empty. So, at the time you wish to update a connection's type map, if you  know that this is the first time it's being updated, it's not necessary to retrieve the existing type  map. Instead, you can create a new Map object such as a HashTable, add your mapping entries  to it, and use it to update the connection. However, it's easier and less problematic to just retrieve  the existing type map, empty or not, from a connection. To retrieve an existing type map from a  Connection object, use the getTypeMap    method, which has the following signature:   Map getTypeMap      For example, to get the type map for the current connection named conn, use code similar to the  following:   java.util.Map map = conn.getTypeMap    ;  Once you've retrieved the type map, you're ready to add mapping entries to it.    16.2.3.2 Adding mapping entries   To add new entries to a type map, use the Map object's put    method, passing the database  type name and a copy of the class that implements the database type. To create a copy of a  class, use the Class.forName    method. The put    method has the following signature:   Object put Object key, Object value   which breaks down as:  key    The key with which the specified value will be associated -- in our case, the name of a  database type    value    returned Object    The value to be associated with the specified key -- in our case, an instance of the  appropriate custom Java class     A copy of an existing Object value for the specified key, or null    For example, to add the custom Java class Location, which mirrors the database type  LOCATION_TYP to the Map object retrieved earlier, your code will be similar to this:   map.put "SCOTT.LOCATION_TYP", Class.forName "Location"  ;  Here, the key, SCOTT.LOCATION_TYP, is the fully qualified name of the database object type  upon which the LOCATION_OT object table was created. For the key's value, the  Class.forName    method is called, passing the name of the Location class.  Class.forName   , in turn, instantiates a copy of the class. When you're finished adding  mapping entries to the Map object, you're ready to update your connection with it.   16.2.3.3 Setting the updated type map   The last step in adding your custom Java classes to a type map is to update your connection's  type map by using the Connection object's setTypeMap    method. The setTypeMap     method has the following signature:   setTypeMap Map map   in which map is the Map object to which you've added your desired entries. For example, to  update the Connection object, conn, with the Map object, map, which we modified earlier, use  the following code:   conn.setTypeMap map ;  Following is an example in which we retrieve the type map from Connection, conn, add the  classes we created earlier, and then write the modified type map back to conn:   java.util.Map map = conn.getTypeMap    ;  map.put "SCOTT.LOCATION_TYP",          Class.forName "Location"  ;   map.put    "SCOTT.PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_TYP",   Class.forName "PersonIdentifierType"  ;  map.put "SCOTT.PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYP",  Class.forName "PersonIdentifier"  ;  map.put "SCOTT.PERSON_TYP",            Class.forName "Person"  ;   map.put "SCOTT.PERSON_LOCATION_TYP",   Class.forName "PersonLocation"  ;   conn.setTypeMap map ;  It's important to notice that we used the subclasses Location and Person, not the  superclasses JLocation and JPerson, when adding entries to the type map.   16.2.4 Using getObject    with a Type Map  If all you do in your program is retrieve objects from a database, you have another option at your  disposal. Instead of updating your connection's type map, you can create a new type map and  pass it to one of the overloaded forms of the getObject    method. Here are the signatures for  the two forms of the getObject    method that allow you to specify a type map:   Object getObject int i, Map map   Object getObject String colName, Map map   The first method takes the relative position of a column in the SELECT statement, starting with 1,  as the first parameter, and a type map as the second parameter. The second method takes a  column name  from the SELECT statement  as the first parameter and a type map for the  second. These two methods allow you to use a type map to retrieve database objects without  having to change your connection's type map.   16.2.5 Inserting an Object    Once you have your custom Java classes and an updated type map, you're ready to store an  object in the database. In this section, we'll concentrate on inserting a new object into the  database. The process for inserting an object is basically the same as it was when using a  Struct object, but this time, you'll be using a custom Java class instead of a Struct. Because  the process is basically the same, I won't get into as much detail here as I did in Chapter 15.    Assuming you have updated a connection with an updated type map that includes your custom  Java classes, the process for inserting an object is:    1.  Create a new instance of your custom Java class, setting the values for the new object   where appropriate.    2.  Formulate an INSERT statement for an object table where the VALUES clause has one   placeholder for your new object.    3.  Create a PreparedStatement object using your INSERT statement.    4.  Use the setObject    method to set the value of the placeholder.    5.  Execute the prepared statement.   16.2.5.1 Creating a new instance of a custom Java class   Creating a new instance of one of your custom Java classes is fairly straightforward. If you've  been using Java for any period of time, you've already done this many times. To create a new  instance, declare a variable of a custom Java class. Then assign it an instance of its custom Java  class by using the new operator:   Person person = new Person conn ;  Here, we've created a new instance of a Person object with the new operator and assigned it to  the variable person. In this case, we've used our alternative constructor that takes a connection  as an argument, so we can later call the person object's getId    method to allocate a new  primary key sequence. Now that we have a new person instance, we can use its accessor  methods to set its attribute values. For example:      Call the Person object's getId     method to get the next       sequence value from the database for its primary key  long personId = person.getId    ;  person.setPersonId personId ;    person.setLastName "O'Reilly" ;  person.setFirstName "Tim" ;  person.setMiddleName null ;  person.setBirthDate    Timestamp.valueOf "1972-03-17 00:00:00.0"  ;  person.setMothersMaidenName "Oh! I don't know!" ;       The Oracle collection, PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TAB, must still be      manipulated as a JDBC Array, but this time, we populate the      Array object with our custom Java class personIdentifier      instead of Struct  Object[] ids = new Object[2];  personIdentifier = new PersonIdentifier    ;  personIdentifier.setId "EID" ;  personIdentifier.setIdType "000000001" ;  ids[0] = personIdentifier;  personIdentifier = new PersonIdentifier    ;    personIdentifier.setId "SDL" ;  personIdentifier.setIdType "CA9999999999" ;  ids[1] = personIdentifier;  oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor idArrayDescriptor =   oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor.createDescriptor    "PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TAB", conn ;   personIdentifiers = new oracle.sql.ARRAY    idArrayDescriptor, conn, ids  ;   person.setIdentifiers personIdentifiers ;  In this example, we first call the getID    method to allocate a new primary key value for the  object. Next, we set the attribute values until we get to the Oracle collection  PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TAB. The collection must still be manipulated using a JDBC Array  object, but this time we populate the Array object with our custom Java class  personIdentifier instead of with a Struct.   16.2.5.2 Formulating an INSERT statement   The next step is to formulate an INSERT statement to be used with a prepared statement to  insert a new row into an object table. Since an object table has one column, which is based on a  database user-defined type, an appropriate INSERT statement will contain one placeholder in the  INSERT statement's VALUES clause:   insert into person_ot values   ?    Here, we've formulated an INSERT statement to insert a PERSON_TYP object into the  PERSON_OT object table.    16.2.5.3 Creating a prepared statement object   If you've read the entire book up to this point, then creating a prepared statement is a no-brainer.  See Chapter 11 if you need a refresher. To create a prepared statement, call the Connection  object's prepareStatement    method, passing it a valid SQL statement:   PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement    "insert into person_ot values   ?  " ;  16.2.5.4 Set the object value   Now that we have a prepared statement, we can set the VALUES clause placeholder using the  PreparedStatement object's setObject    method:   pstmt.setObject 1, person ;  Since the connection's type map was updated to map the database type PERSON_TYP to the  Java class Person, the prepared statement's setObject    method can use this knowledge to  automatically map the attributes in Person to PERSON_TYP using the SQLData interface's  writeSQL    method.   16.2.5.5 Execute the prepared statement   The last step in inserting a database object is to execute the prepared statement. As we have  done countless times before, we execute the prepared statement using the  PreparedStatement object's executeUpdate    method:   int rows = pstmt.executeUpdate    ;  After committing the INSERT statement, you can use SQL*Plus to verify the existence of the  object in the PERSON_OT object table.   16.2.6 Retrieving an Object    Now that you know how to insert an object, let's take a look at how to retrieve one. Once again,  the process for retrieving a database object is very similar to the process used in Chapter 15,  except this time, you use your custom Java class instead of a Struct object.    Again, assuming that you have updated a connection with an updated type map that includes  your custom Java class, the process for selecting an object from the database is:    1.  Create a variable of your custom Java class's type to hold the retrieved object.    2.  Formulate a SELECT statement against an object table using the database value      function, passing that function the alias for the table name.    3.  Create a Statement or PreparedStatement object using your formulated SELECT   statement.    4.  Execute the SELECT statement.   5.  Use the getObject    method to place the value of the row object into your custom   Java class variable.    16.2.6.1 Creating a variable to hold your database object   Creating a variable to hold the database object when it is retrieved from the database is  something we've been doing all along. This time, however, instead of creating a String to hold a  VARCHAR2, or a Long to hold a NUMBER, or a Timestamp to hold a DATE, you create a  variable that is your custom Java class's type to hold the corresponding database object. For  example, to create a variable for database type PERSON_TYP, use the following code:   Person person = null;  This code creates a Person variable, person, that we'll use to hold a copy of the database  object for type PERSON_TYP.    16.2.6.2 Formulating a SELECT statement   Now that we have the person variable, let's formulate a SELECT statement to retrieve an object  from the database. Since an object table consists of one column of a specific user-defined data  type, you must use the database value    function, passing it the object table's alias as in the  SELECT statement to select a copy of an object from the database. For example:   select value p  from person_ot p  Here, the object table PERSON_OT is aliased with the character p. Accordingly, the alias p is  passed to the database value    function in order to retrieve a copy of a PERSON_TYP object  from the database. For example, to select a copy of Tim O'Reilly's Person object from the  database, use the following SELECT statement:   select value p  from person_ot p  where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly'   and    first_name = 'Tim'  16.2.6.3 Creating a statement object   Now that we have a SELECT statement, we need to create a Statement or a  PreparedStatement object to execute it. Since we formulated a SELECT statement for use  with a Statement object, we'll create a Statement:   stmt = conn.createStatement    ;  16.2.6.4 Executing the SELECT statement    The next step in the process is to execute the SELECT statement. This is done using the  Statement object's executeQuery    method:   ResultSet rslt = stmt.executeQuery    "select value p  from person_ot p " +   "where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly' " +    "and    first_name = 'Tim' " ;  16.2.6.5 Getting an object value from a result set   The last step in the object-retrieval process is to get the object value from the result set and  assign it to your local object variable. Since the type map has already been updated for the  object, when you call a ResultSet object's getObject    method to retrieve the object, JDBC  will automatically instantiate the appropriate class and return a reference to it. All you have to do  is cast the result of the getObject    method to the appropriate type. For example, to retrieve  a Person object, use the following code:   if  rslt.next        person =  Person rslt.getObject 1 ;  At this point, we have a copy of the database object as an instance of a custom Java class. If we  want to use the methods added to the subclass Person, we need to call the Person object's  setConnection    method so a connection is available in the object instance. Now we are  retrieving objects from the database!    Since we've covered the processes for inserting and selecting an object, we're ready to cover the  process for updating an object.   16.2.7 Updating an Object  The process for updating an object is very similar to selecting and then inserting an object, with  two exceptions. First, you retrieve an existing object and update one or more of its attributes.  Second, you need to use a prepared UPDATE statement. Since we've covered all the necessary  steps earlier, let's concentrate on formulating that UPDATE statement.    An UPDATE statement for an object requires you to use the database value    function on the  lefthand side of the equals sign in the SET clause and a placeholder on the right:   update person_ot p   set value p  = ?  Then, set the value of the placeholder using an updated copy of the database object:   pstmt.setObject 1, person ;  The last thing to learn about manipulating database objects using SQLData is how to delete one.   16.2.8 Deleting an Object  Deleting a database object does not require the SQLData interface. All you need to do is  formulate an appropriate DELETE statement using the object table's name and a WHERE clause.  For example, to delete Tim O'Reilly's Person object, use the following DELETE statement:   delete person_ot   where  last_name  = 'O''Reilly'   and    first_name = 'Tim'  At this point, we're ready to put all you've learned into a working example.   16.2.9 A SQLData Example    Example 16-1 takes the SQLData classes that we've created so far and puts them to work,  inserting, updating, and selecting data from the database. The program performs the following  actions in order to exercise the use of the SQLData interface:    1.  Updates the connection's type map   2.  Deletes any old objects from prior executions of the program   Inserts a Person object into PERSON_OT   Inserts a Location object into LOCATION_OT   3.   4.   5.

The process    method starts by allocating required  variables, most notably location, personIdentifier, person, and personLocation.  Each represents a custom SQLData class we created earlier. Then the program proceeds to the  first of eight try blocks where it extracts the connection's type map, adds the custom Java  classes, and saves the map.    Next, the program performs a little housekeeping by deleting any objects that were created by a  previous execution of the program. After that, the program starts its third try block where it  inserts a new Person object.    Now that we are using SQLData classes with our type methods implemented, the process of  creating a new Person object is greatly simplified when compared to the use of the Struct  object in the TestStruct program. The program first creates a new instance of a Person object  using the alternate constructor that accepts a Connection object. Then it proceeds by calling  the new Person object's getId    method to get the next primary key value for the object from  the database. This is saved in the BigDecimal variable personId so it can be used later in the  program. Then the Person accessor methods are called to set the new object's attributes. Before  it can set the identifiers attribute, it must build a java.sql.Array for the collection. This  time, however, that process is simplified by the use of the PersonIdentifier class. Two  PersonIdentifier objects are created and stored in an Object array, which in turn is passed  to the constructor for a new oracle.sql.ARRAY, along with an appropriate array descriptor to  create the new Array. The resulting Array is then assigned to the Person object's  identifiers attribute. Finally, a PreparedStatement object is created, and a setObject     method is called, passing the newly created Person object. Then the prepared statement is  executed, inserting the Person object into the database.    A similar process is followed in the next two try blocks in order to add a location and a person's  location. For the PersonLocation object, the default constructor is used, because the  previously saved personId and locationId values are used as its primary key.     Next, the program proceeds with two more try blocks that retrieve and update the Person  object. The first of the two update try blocks uses standard JDBC to update the object, while the  second uses Oracle's REF object's proprietary getValue    and setValue    methods,  which makes the REF act similar to a LOB locator, to update the object.    Finally, the last try block retrieves the person object from the database and echoes its contents  to the screen. The program utilizes the Array object's getResultSet    method to treat the  contents of the Array, identifiers, as a result set. Note that before the two member  methods, getAge    and getAgeOn   , are called, the program calls the Person object's  setConnection    method to supply the retrieved object with the required Connection in  order to use the member methods.    As you can see from Example 16-1, using SQLData greatly simplifies the storage and retrieval  of an object to and from the database. But we still had to deal with the java.sql.Array  interface for the Oracle collection. If you're not concerned about portability, then use the Oracle  CustomDatum interface instead. With the CustomDatum interface, JPublisher not only creates  an array for the Oracle collection, but also generates the wrapper methods for the type methods - - in essence, a complete object solution. So let's take a look at Oracle's CustomDatum interface.   16.3 Oracle's CustomDatum Interface  In this section, you will learn how to use Oracle's CustomDatum interface classes to manipulate  database objects. However, since we covered the SQLData interface in great detail, and there  are minimal differences between the CustomDatum classes and the SQLData classes, I won't  get into nearly as much detail as I did with SQLData.    Oracle's CustomDatum interface classes created by JPublisher are for one-stop shopping. When  you use JPublisher with the option -usertypes=oracle, it creates custom classes for all the  database data types you specify, including references and collections, and also creates wrapper  methods for static and member type methods. In addition, if you use CustomDatum, no type map  is required.    If you specify methods=true or methods=named, JPublisher generates .sqlj files instead of  .java files. The .sqlj files then need to be compiled using SQLJ to create the corresponding .java  files. The default constructor for the generated classes uses the SQLJ default Context for a  connection -- you don't want to use this. Instead, use one of the alternate constructors, that is,  one that takes a Connection as an argument. Let's go ahead and start generating  CustomDatum classes. Our first concern will be creating an appropriate input file.   16.3.1 Creating an Input File for CustomDatum   The mapping input file for generating CustomDatum classes is different from the one we used for  SQLData. First, since JPublisher can generate the methods for us, we no longer need to  subclass types LOCATION_TYP and PERSON_TYP. Second, even with the option  case=mixed, JPublisher does not use the proper convention for naming Java methods, so we'll  use the TRANSLATE clause to rename the methods manually. So here's the input file,  customdatum.input:   SQL LOCATION_TYP               AS LocationTyp  SQL PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_TYP AS PersonIdentifierTypeTyp   SQL PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TAB      AS PersonIdentifierTab   SQL PERSON_IDENTIFIER_TYP      AS PersonIdentifierTyp   SQL PERSON_TYP                 AS PersonTyp   TRANSLATE GET_AGE             AS getAge,             GET_AGE_ON          AS getAgeOn    SQL PERSON_LOCATION_TYP        AS PersonLocationTyp  If we didn't translate GET_AGE to getAge, then JPublisher would name the method GetAge. But  there's something missing. We haven't listed the static GET_ID methods from LOCATION_TYP  and PERSON_TYP. Why? We intentionally leave out the GET_ID methods because there is a  defect in JPublisher for Oracle 8.1.6 that prevents it from generating a wrapper for a static  method with no arguments. There are only two workarounds. First, you can rewrite the GET_ID  method to take a dummy argument. Or second, you can patch the generated .sqlj files, adding  the code for the GET_ID methods, before you compile them into .java files. This defect is  reportedly fixed in Oracle 8.1.7. So if you're using a later version of JPublisher, you need to add  the TRANSLATE clauses for the rest of your methods to the input file. Now that we have an input  file, let's move on to creating a properties file.   16.3.2 Creating a Properties File for CustomDatum   You need to change two options in the properties file in order to generate CustomDatum classes.  The first is to use the option methods=named instead of methods=false. We use named so  only the methods listed in the TRANSLATE clause of the input file are generated. This is part of  the workaround for the JPublisher defect, but it's also a good idea to use named anyway. Then  you can choose which methods to include in your Java classes. This is helpful if you decide to  subclass a JPublisher-generated class to add client-side methods instead of calling those in the  database. The second, and critical, change is to use the option usertypes=oracle instead of  usertypes=jdbc. This is what directs JPublisher to create CustomDatum classes. Accordingly,  here's the properties file, customdatum.properties:   jpub.user=scott tiger  jpub.methods=named  jpub.builtintypes=jdbc  jpub.lobtypes=jdbc  jpub.numbertypes=objectjdbc  jpub.usertypes=oracle  jpub.input=customdatum.input  At this point, we have an input file and a properties file, so we can generate the classes by  executing JPublisher with the following command at the command prompt:   jpub -props=customdatum.properties  JPublisher will then generate the following five .sqlj source files:   LocationTyp.sqlj   PersonIdentifierTypeTyp.sqlj   PersonIdentifierTyp.sqlj   PersonTyp.sqlj   PersonLocationTyp.sqlj   and create the following six .java source files:  LocationTypRef.java   PersonIdentifierTypeTypRef.java   PersonIdentifierTypRef.java   JPersonTypRef.java   PersonLocationTypRef.java   Since we need to patch the PersonTyp.sqlj and LocationTyp.sqlj files, we'll do that next. Here's  the SQLJ code to add a wrapper method for GET_ID to the LocationTyp.sqlj file:   public java.math.BigDecimal getId       throws SQLException  {    java.math.BigDecimal _  _jPt_result;      sql [_ctx] _  _jPt_result = { VALUES LOCATION_TYP.GET_ID      };     return _  _jPt_result;  }  And here's the SQLJ code to add a wrapper method for GET_ID to the PersonTyp.sqlj file:   public java.math.BigDecimal getId       throws SQLException  {    java.math.BigDecimal _  _jPt_result;    sql [_ctx] _  _jPt_result = { VALUES PERSON_TYP.GET_ID      };     return _  _jPt_result;  }  After you've added the code to patch the .sqlj files, then you're ready to compile the .sqlj files into  .java files.    If you're wondering how I knew how to code the two methods, I didn't. I copied a member method  call from the PersonTyp.sqlj file and hacked the code. If you really want to know how to code  using SQLJ, I suggest you investigate Java Programming with Oracle SQLJ, by Jason Price   O'Reilly .   16.3.3 Compiling SQLJ Files  Before you use SQLJ, you need to make sure its class file is on the ClassPath. In the Windows  environment, you should have something like the following as part of your ClassPath:   C:\Oracle\Ora81\sqlj\lib\translator.zip;  C:\Oracle\Ora81\sqlj\lib\runtime.zip;  Assuming you do have the correct ClassPath setting, compile the .sqlj files using SQLJ by  typing the following commands at the command prompt:   sqlj LocationTyp.sqlj  sqlj PersonIdentifierTypeTyp.sqlj  sqlj PersonIdentifierTyp.sqlj  sqlj PersonTyp.sqlj  sqlj PersonLocationTyp.sqlj  This produces five more Java source files:   LocationTyp..java   PersonIdentifierTypeTyp..java   PersonIdentifierTyp..java   PersonTyp..java   PersonLocationTyp..java   You need to compile each of these five additional Java source files, and also the previously  created Java source files, before attempting to use them in a program.    Now that we have all the supporting classes we need, let's put them all together in a working  example.   16.3.4 A CustomDatum Example   Example 16-2, TestCustomDatum, is essentially the same as the TestSQLData program, but  with a few significant differences:       The program does not have to add any classes to the connection's type map. The Oracle   driver recognizes and maps the CustomDatum classes automatically -- well, almost.        The program no longer uses the weakly typed Array class; instead, it uses the custom  class PersonIdentifierTab created by JPublisher. This makes the creation of the  identifiers attribute simpler and more easily understood.       As you can see with the insert a PersonLocation try block, the CustomDatum   constructor always takes a Connection object when used with JDBC.       Do you remember when I said, "well, almost?" Well, an OracleResultSet is required   to retrieve the classes using its proprietary method, getCustomDatum   , which  requires that a CustomDatumFactory object be passed as a parameter. This is what  really takes the place of the need to modify the type map.       The getElement    method is used to retrieve the elements of the collection   identifiers.    Example 16-2.

Now we'll move on to Part V, which will cover more global topics such as transactions, detection  and locking, performance, and troubleshooting.   Part V: Essentials   Part V covers the essentials that every application programmer using a database  should know about but is sometimes afraid to ask:    "It's so obvious, right?"    "Well, no, it's not!"    Here, we'll cover what database transactions are, their scope, and Oracle's use  of implicit locking. We'll also cover distributed transactions. Then we'll look at  several strategies and tactics you can employ to ensure data integrity. Next, we'll  investigate performance issues. And finally, we'll take a lighthearted look at  troubleshooting. While not strictly JDBC, these are essential topics that every  JDBC programmer should understand.   Chapter 17. Transactions    So far we've been talking about all the ways to connect to a database and how to manipulate  data in a database, but we haven't said much about transactions. If your JDBC Connection is in  auto-commit mode, which it is by default, then every DML statement is committed to the database  upon its completion. That may be fine for simple applications, but there are three reasons why  you may want to turn off auto-commit and manage your own transactions:       To increase performance     To maintain the integrity of business processes     To use distributed transactions   First, if you are performing batch insert, update, or delete operations, then turning off auto-commit  and committing results manually at reasonable intervals will improve performance. Note that I  said "at reasonable intervals." If you perform more operations per transaction than can fit into a  rollback segment, the database takes additional time to increase the rollback segment to hold  your uncommitted transaction statements, and that impairs performance.    The second reason why you may want to manage your own transactions is to maintain the  integrity of your business processes. For example, if a customer places an order for some  merchandise, the information you'd need to store for that order would include a list of items to  purchase, billing and shipping information, and an authorized credit card charge. This information  would likely be stored in several different tables. Without a manually managed transaction, it's  possible to enter part of the order, and then the system fails. The rest of the order information is  then lost. This results in an incomplete business transaction.    The third reason why you may want to manage your own transactions is to take advantage of the  benefits of distributed systems. If you have to acquire information from, or update, several  different systems, perhaps of unrelated technology, then you can use Oracle database links to  perform a distributed transaction. Alternatively, you can use an XA connection, which is a  connection based on the X Open XA Architecture that supports distributed transaction  processing.    In this chapter, we'll look at how to enable manual-transaction support, the scope of transactions,  and their implications for the visibility of database changes. We'll finish with a discussion of the  distributed transaction support provided by Oracle's JDBC implementation. So let's get started  with a look at how to enable manual transactions.   17.1 Manual Transactions  To enable manual- transaction support instead of the auto-commit mode that the JDBC driver  uses by default, use the Connection object's setAutoCommit    method. If you pass a  boolean false to setAutoCommit   , you turn off auto-commit. You can pass a boolean true  to turn it back on again. For example, if you have a Connection object named conn, code the  following to turn off auto-commit:   conn.setAutoCommit false ;  Disabling auto-commit is simple enough, but what are the implications of handling transactions  manually? When is a particular transaction complete, and when does a new one start? And what  effects does a manual transaction have on the implicit locking mechanism of an Oracle  database? Let's begin by defining the scope of a transaction.   17.2 Transaction Scope  An existing transaction ends, and a new transaction starts, at the moment a commit or rollback  command is issued. Assuming you've turned off auto-commit, a COMMIT statement makes    permanent any changes you've made to the database using INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE  statements since the last time a COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement was executed. With JDBC,  commit your changes manually by calling the Connection object's commit    method. Calling  the commit    method sends a COMMIT to the database. The commit    method takes no  arguments but may throw an SQLException. However, it's very rare for a commit to result in an  exception. For example, to commit changes for the Connection named conn, use the following  code:   conn.commit    ;  On the other hand, a rollback command irrevocably discards, or undoes, any INSERT, UPDATE,  or DELETE statements you've executed since the last time a COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement  was executed. To roll back, use the Connection object's rollback    method. For example,  to roll back updates to the database made using the Connection named conn, use the  following code:   conn.rollback    ;  One last note: while auto-commit is off, if a Connection is closed without committing or rolling  back, or if any DDL is executed, then any uncommitted changes are automatically committed.   17.3 Implicit Locking and Visibility  It's important for you to understand the implications that a transaction has on implicit locking and  visibility. Implicit locking refers to how Oracle automatically locks a database row during an insert,  update, or delete operation. To help you understand the effects of implicit locking, I've created a  table, TEST_TRANS, that has two columns: COL1, which is the table's primary key, and COL2.  Figure 17-1 is a timeline for SQL statements against table TEST_TRANS. On the left are SQL  statements entered from the same transaction and session. On the right are the effects of those  SQL statements on the other session.    Figure 17-1. Implicit locking during manual transactions       To begin, session one performs an insert on table TEST_TRANS:  insert into test_trans   col1   values   'X'    From the moment the INSERT statement is successfully executed, Oracle places an implicit lock  on the new row. Since the new row has not been committed, it is not visible to an UPDATE,  DELETE, or SELECT statement from session two. However, if attempts are made in session two  to insert a row with the same primary key, that session will be blocked indefinitely until the first  transaction is either committed or rolled back. When session one commits, the INSERT statement  in session two will fail with a duplicate key error. After the commit, session one's new row is  visible to an UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT statement from session two.    Session one now executes an UPDATE statement against the newly inserted and committed row:   update test_trans set col2 = 'A' where col1 = 'X'  Oracle once again places an implicit lock on the row. This time, an INSERT statement from  session two with the same primary key will fail immediately. Furthermore, because of the implicit  lock, any DML statement issued from session two will see a copy of the row as it was before it  was updated by session one's UPDATE statement. However, an UPDATE or DELETE statement  from session two against the same row will be blocked indefinitely until session one commits or  rolls back its changes. When session one commits its UPDATE statement, then any blocked  UPDATE or DELETE statement in session two will execute immediately. After the commit, any  subsequent SELECT statement from session two will see the new row values.    A major concern here is that even though session one's row was locked, when the lock was  released through a commit, session two's UPDATE statement did not take into consideration the  impact of session one's changes. Instead, session one's changes were simply overwritten. The  only way to solve this problem is to use some form of change detection, such as looking at a  timestamp, at an updatestamp, or at all the columns you are modifying with your UPDATE  statement. We'll cover more of this issue in Chapter 18. Keep in mind that you, as the  programmer, are responsible for preventing this type of situation from happening with your code.    Session one continues by executing the following DELETE statement:  delete test_trans where col1 = 'X'  Oracle once again places an implicit lock on the row. This time, any insert, update, or delete from  session two against that row is blocked until session one commits or rolls back its DELETE  statement. Meanwhile, any SELECT statement from session two continues to see the row as it  existed before the delete. When session one commits its DELETE statement, any INSERT  statements from session two that use the same primary key will be successful. Any UPDATE,  DELETE, or SELECT statement from session two will find no rows to affect.    For this scenario, I've assumed that Oracle's default transaction isolation level, which is read  committed, is used. Oracle also supports a serializable level.   17.4 Isolation Levels  When applied to transactions, the term isolation level refers to how well one transaction is  isolated from another. Oracle's default transaction isolation level is read committed. You can get  the current isolation level for a connection by using the Connection object's  getTransactionIsolation    method. You can set the transaction isolation level by calling  the Connection object's setTransactionIsolation    method and passing one of the two  valid constants: TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED or TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE. Oracle's  read serializable isolation level will give you a consistent view of data from multiple tables since  the last commit or rollback. Essentially, you see a snapshot of the tables as they existed when the  transaction started. This is as opposed to read committed, which allows you to see changes  during your transaction as soon as other transactions commit.     17.5 Distributed Transactions  A distributed transaction is a set of two or more individual transactions, or branches, managed  externally by a transaction manager and committed or rolled back as a single, global transaction.  When it comes to distributed transactions, you have two choices of how to implement them. If you  need to implement a distributed transaction between two or more Oracle databases, you can use  database links. When using database links, you act as though your distributed transaction is just  another local transaction and let Oracle's two-phase commit mechanism take care of the  distributed transaction process transparently. But what if you want to manage a transaction  between an Oracle and a Sybase database? Or with a credit card processing center? For cases  such as these, you can use the JDBC 2.0 optional package's XAConnection object instead of a  standard Connection object.    Oracle's XA functionality implements the JDBC 2.0 optional package's support for distributed  transactions. Although distributed transaction functionality is typically supported by an application  server, such as one that supports Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB , this does not mean that you can't  take advantage of the XA infrastructure to manage your own distributed transactions.    To create an XAConnection object, use an XADataSource. For the most part, Oracle's  XADataSource is configured just like, and allocates connections just like, the DataSource and  ConnectionPoolDataSource objects we covered in Chapter 7. Therefore, I won't cover  much about establishing a connection using the XA facility, because you can refer to Chapter 7  and the Oracle API for most of what you need to know. Further, XA is typically implemented in a  middle-tier application server, and, as an application developer, you typically use it in a somewhat  transparent way. For example, if you develop EJB, the EJB container uses the XA infrastructure  to manage distributed transactions for your EJB. So for most of us, the XA classes are of little  use. Given that, we won't spend much time on this topic. Instead, just to ensure that you are  familiar with distributed transaction concepts, I'll simply provide an example of an XADataSource  and an XAConnection in a sample program.    Let's take a moment to cover the typical steps taken for a distributed transaction using XA with  two data sources:    1.  Each data source, or branch, of the distributed transaction gets an XAConnection  object, which represents a physical connection to a transaction manager, such as a  database, from its XADataSource object.    2.  Using the XAConnection object, each branch gets a Connection object that will be   used to perform SQL manipulations.    3.  Again, using the XAConnection object, each branch gets an XAResource object, which   will be used to coordinate the distributed transaction with the other branches.    4.  A global transaction ID is created that will be used to create Xid objects for each branch   to coordinate a distributed transaction.    5.  For each branch, a branch transaction ID is created that will be used along with the   global ID to create an Xid object for each branch.    6.  An Xid object is created for each branch using an ID format identifier, a global ID, and a   branch ID.    7.  Each branch starts its leg of the distributed transaction by using the XAResource   object's start    method, passing it the branch's Xid object. Next, any desired SQL    statements are executed. The branch's leg is then ended by calling the XAResource  object's end    method.    8.  After each branch of a distributed transaction completes its SQL operations, it each calls  its XAResource object's prepare    method to prepare for a global commit or rollback  operation.    9.   If all branches report a successful prepare phase, then each branch calls its  XAResource object's commit    method. Otherwise, it calls its XAResource object's  rollback    method.    Now that you have the big picture of how distributed transactions are implemented using XA, let's  look at the details. We'll start with the optional package's XADataSource interface.   17.5.1 XA Data Sources  The XADataSource interface is implemented with the OracleXADataSource class and uses  the same properties as the DataSource and ConnectionPoolDataSource classes we  discussed in Chapter 7. XADataSource objects are factories for XAConnection objects,  which in turn are factories for Connection and XAResource objects. Instead of the two  overloaded getConnection    methods found in the DataSource interface, the  XADataSource interface has two overloaded getXAConnection    methods with the  following signatures. Keep in mind that they, like all JDBC methods, can throw a SQLException.   XAConnection getXAConnection      XAConnection getXAConnection String username, String Password   You can configure JNDI to allocate XADataSource objects just as we did for DataSource  objects in Chapter 7. After you've created an XADataSource object, your next step is to  allocate an XAConnection using one of the two getXAConnection    methods.   17.5.2 XA Connections  An XAConnection extends PooledConnection and is implemented by the OracleXA- Connection class. An XAConnection represents a physical database connection. Seeing that  an XAConnection object extends a PooledConnection, it inherits all of the  PooledConnection methods:   addConnectionEventListener      close      getConnection      removeConnectionEventListener      In addition to the PooledConnection methods, the XAConnection interface defines one more  method, getXAResource   . Following is the additional method signature. As usual, the  method can throw a SQLException.   XAResource getXAResource      Like the connection returned by a PooledConnection object, the Connection object returned  by an XAConnection is not the same type of Connection object returned by DriverManager.  At least, they are not the same internally. However, the two Connection objects implement the  same Connection interface, so they appear to be the same. The difference is that the close     method of a Connection object from an XAConnection object returns a connection to  XAConnection, an intermediary that provides the hooks for distributing a transaction and does  not necessarily close the physical connection to a database. Calling XAConnection object's  close    method actually closes the physical connection to a database.     17.5.3 XA IDs  The Xid interface, which is implemented by the OracleXid class, is composed of a 4-byte  format identifier, a 64-byte distributed transaction ID that is shared among all the Xid objects  involved in a distributed transaction, and a 64-byte transaction branch ID for each branch of a  distributed transaction. A transaction manager in a middle-tier application server can use the  Oracle OracleXid constructor to create a new Xid object, passing the constructor a format ID,  a global or distributed transaction ID, and a branch transaction ID. The Xid interface has three  getter methods:   getFormatId      getGlobalTransactionId      getBranchQualifier    .  17.5.4 XA Resources  An XAResource object, which is implemented by OracleXAResource, does the actual  multiphase commit for a distributed transaction. To do a multiphase commit, use a global  transaction ID represented by an Xid object together with appropriate methods from  XAResource. The XAResource methods have the following signatures, and all of the methods  can throw an XAException:   void commit Xid xid, boolean onePhase   void end Xid xid, int flags   void forget Xid xid   void prepare Xid xid   Xid[] recover int flag   void rollback Xid xid   void start Xid xid, int flags    With Version 8.1.6, the forget    and recover     methods are not implemented.          Using an XAResource object, you typically start, end, prepare, and commit or roll back a  transaction. When using a Connection object from an XAConnection, you cannot use the  connection's commit    or rollback    methods. Instead, you must use the XAResource  object's commit    or rollback    methods. If you do inadvertently use a Connection  object's commit    or rollback    method, you'll get a SQLException. A transaction  manager, typically your database, uses XAResource objects to coordinate the individual  transactions, or branches, of a distributed transaction. When you perform a distributed  transaction, you start a transaction branch, execute some DML statements, end the branch, and  then repeat those steps for as many branches as is required. Then prepare each branch to  commit, and then commit the changes.    To start a new transaction branch and associate it with a distributed transaction, use the start     method, passing it an Xid along with the XAResource object's constant TMNOFLAGS as a  second parameter. The start    method transparently associates a branch with a distributed  transaction, because the Xid object passed to it has a common global ID. Here is a list of all the  XAResource constants that can be used with the start    method:   TMNOFLAGS    Starts a new transaction branch   TMJOIN    Adds to an existing transaction branch    TMRESUME    Resumes a previously suspended branch   To end a transaction branch, use the end    method, passing it an Xid and one of the following  XAResource constants as a second parameter. Which constant you should pass depends on  whether your SQL manipulations were successful.   TMSUCCESS    The transaction was successful.   TMFAIL    TMSUSPEND    The transaction failed.   Suspends the transaction branch.   To prepare a branch for a two-phase commit, use its XAResource object's prepare     method, passing it the branch's Xid. The prepare    method returns one of the following  XAResource constants:   XA_RDONLY    This result notifies the application that the connection supports only read-only activities  such as SELECT statements.    XA_OK    This result notifies the application that the update prepared successfully.    A call to prepare    may throw an XAException if an error is encountered during any of the  branches being prepared.    To commit the prepared changes in a transaction branch, call its XAResource object's commit     method, passing the transaction branch's Xid and a boolean to direct the commit method to  use a one-phase  true  or two-phase  false  commit protocol. The default, if you don't pass a  boolean, is to do a two-phase commit. To roll back the changes in a transaction branch, call the  rollback    method, passing the transaction branch's Xid.    To determine whether two branches have the same resource manager, call the XAResource's  sameRM    method, passing it another XAResource object. The sameRM    method returns a  boolean. A true return value means that both branches indeed use the same resource manager.  With this information, you can direct two branches to use the same resource manager.    Now that we've talked about XAResource and have referred to an XAException several times,  let's discuss XAException objects.   17.5.5 XA Exceptions  XA methods throw an XAException, which is implemented by OracleXAException. Besides  the standard getMessage    method that all exceptions have, the OracleXAException class  also defines a getXAError    method that returns one of the XA error message constants  defined in XAException. There's also a getOracleError    method that returns the number  of the Oracle error. Table 17-1 maps common XAException error code constants to their  Oracle error equivalents.    Table 17-1. XA-to-Oracle error codes     XAException constant   Oracle error code and message   XAER_RMFAIL    ORA-03113 end-of-file on communication channel.   XAER_RMFAIL    ORA-03114 not connected to ORACLE.   XAER_NOTA    ORA-24756 transaction does not exist.    XA_HEURCOM    ORA-24764 transaction branch has been heuristically committed.    XA_HEURRB    ORA-24765 transaction branch has been heuristically rolled back.    XA_HEURMIX    ORA-24766 transaction branch has been partly committed and aborted.    XA_RDONLY    ORA-24767 transaction was read-only and has been committed.   XA_RETRY    ORA-25351 transaction is currently in use.   XA_RMERR    All other error codes.   Now that you have an overview of Oracle's support for XA, let's take a look at some  implementation details.   17.5.6 classpath and imports  To use XA, you not only need the Oracle driver file classes12.zip, but you must also have the  Java Transaction API file jta.zip in your classpath. Then you must add the following import  statements to your Java program:   import oracle.jdbc.pool.*;  import oracle.jdbc.xa.OracleXid;  import oracle.jdbc.xa.OracleXAException;     If yours is a client-side, middle-tier program:  import oracle.jdbc.client.*;      Or for a server-side, database resident program:   import oracle.jdbc.server.*;   import javax.transaction.xa.*;  If your Java code will reside in the database, and yet access a remote database, then don't use  the imports. Instead, use the fully qualified names for both the client-side  the part that will  access the remote database  and server-side portions of your program. At this point, we're ready  to look at a working example of a program using XA to perform a distributed transaction.   17.5.7 An XA Example  Now that we've covered Oracle's implementation of XA, let's see it in action. The following DDL is  for four tables: cart, item, shipping, and billing. If you have two databases available, then create  the cart and item tables on the first database, then create the shipping and billing tables on the  second database. Otherwise, create all four tables on the same database.   create table cart    cart     number  not null primary key,   ordered  date    not null    tablespace users pctfree 20  storage  initial 4K next 4K pctincrease 0          create table item    item      number        not null  primary key,  cart      number        not null,  quantity  number        not null,  descr     varchar2 30   not null,  each      number        not null    tablespace users pctfree 20  storage  initial 4K next 4K pctincrease 0        create table shipping    cart      number        not null  primary key,  name      varchar2 30   not null,  address1  varchar2 30   not null,  address2  varchar2 30 ,  city      varchar2 30   not null,  state     varchar2 30 ,  country   varchar2 30   not null,  postal    varchar2 30   not null,  carrier   varchar2 30   not null,  service   varchar2 30   not null    tablespace users pctfree 20  storage  initial 4K next 4K pctincrease 0        create table billing    cart      number         not null  primary key,  name      varchar2 30    not null,  card      varchar2 30    not null,  expires   date           not null,  amount    number         not null    tablespace users pctfree 20  storage  initial 4K next 4K pctincrease 0      Update the database URLs and schema names used in the SQL statements in Example 17-1 to  show where you placed the tables. Also check usernames and passwords, then compile  Example 17-1 and execute it.    Example 17-1.

Then, using each XADatasource object's getXAConnection    method, the program  retrieves two physical connection objects in the form of XAConnections. Using the  XAConnection objects, the program proceeds by retrieving a Connection object and an  XAResource object from each XAConnection object. Next, the program creates a global  transaction ID, two branch transaction IDs, and finally, two Xid objects. These Xid objects are  used to identify the transaction branches as the program continues. The fact that they both  contain the same global ID is what ties the two branches together in one distributed transaction.    After creating the Xid objects, the program starts its first transaction branch by calling the  XAResource object's start    method, passing the local Xid. Next, it performs several DML  statements and ends the transaction branch by calling the XAResource object's end     method. The program continues by starting the remote transaction branch, performing DML  statements, and then ending that branch. At this point, the data manipulations are finished, and  the program is ready to prepare to commit the distributed transaction.    To prepare the distributed transaction, the program calls the XAResource object's prepare     method for both the local and remote branches. Then the return codes from the prepare methods  are tested for success, and the appropriate XAResource object's commit    or rollback     methods are called as required to commit or roll back the transaction. Finally, the program cleans  up its resources by closing first the Connection objects and then the XAConnection objects.    If you run into errors while running TestXA, you may have inadvertently left a distributed  transaction in an inconsistent state. To correct such a problem, log into the server as username  SYS using SQL*Plus and execute the following rollback statement:   rollback force 'globalTransactionId';  In this rollback statement, replace globalTransactionId with the ID of the inconsistent  transaction as reported by the TestXA program.     Chapter 18. Detection and Locking  As I pointed out in Chapter 17 when discussing Oracle's implicit locking mechanism during a  transaction, just because you lock a resource before updating it does not prevent someone else  from corrupting your update with his or her own update. As a matter of fact, database locks unto  themselves do not solve the problem of multiuser data access integrity. Instead, you as the  programmer are responsible for employing a methodology that will prevent application users from  overwriting each other's data.    In this chapter, we'll look into the problem of multiuser update integrity and at how you can use  locks with detection  a pessimistic approach  or update detection  an optimistic approach  to  ensure the integrity of data in a multiuser application. First, we'll examine the locking options  available when utilizing an Oracle database. Then we'll review the reasons why locks alone don't  solve the update integrity problem. We'll continue by exploring detection techniques, that is,  detecting that a change has taken place outside the current session and transaction. Next, we'll  discuss several pessimistic, high-contention approaches to solving the problem of maintaining  data integrity. Finally, we'll discuss an optimistic approach. Since there's a popular notion that  locking alone ensures data integrity, let's start by examining Oracle's locking mechanisms in  order to debunk this notion.   18.1 Oracle's Locking Mechanisms  Oracle provides three locking mechanisms. The first is the implicit locking that automatically takes  place when you execute an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. The second is the ability  to lock rows for an update by first selecting the desired rows using the FOR UPDATE clause in a  SELECT statement. The third is the LOCK TABLE command. Let's review implicit locking first.   18.1.1 Implicit Locking   As we discussed in Chapter 17, if you execute an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement for  a particular row, then the database implicitly locks that row until you commit or roll back the  current transaction. This means that if you perform DML on a table with a primary key constraint  or unique index, and you are not in auto-commit mode, another user in another session with its  own transaction can see the database as it existed before you started your transaction. You may  be thinking to yourself, "Well, that's good, then they can't step all over my data." But you're wrong.  All implicit locking does is prevent the second user from updating the row in question until your  transaction ends. At that point, her update can overwrite any changes you made without her ever  knowing that you've made them.    If you, as the first user, insert a new row, a second user inserting, updating, or deleting a row with  the same primary key or unique index value will wait indefinitely until you end your transaction. At  that time, if the second user is inserting, her insert will fail with a primary key constraint violation.  However, if the second user is updating or deleting, her update or delete will be successful.    If you update a particular row instead of inserting a row, then a second user updating or deleting  the same row will once again wait indefinitely until your transaction ends.    And finally, if you delete a row, then a second user updating or deleting the same row will wait  until your transaction ends, at which point, her update or delete will succeed, but it will succeed  without affecting any rows.    In none of these instances will the second user have any indication that your actions had  changed the row between the time when your SQL statement's implicit lock took place and the  time when the second user's statement executed. No detection at all! This lack of detection is the  data integrity problem we're concerned about. Now, let's look at an example of explicit locking.     18.1.2 Row Locking  Using Oracle's FOR UPDATE clause in a SELECT statement, you can prelock any desired rows  before updating them. The rows you lock with your SELECT statement will remain locked until  you end your transaction with a commit or rollback. For example, to lock all the rows in the person  table with a last name of "O'Reilly," use a SELECT statement such as the following:   select *   from   person   where  last name = 'O''Reilly'   for update;  Of course, using FOR UPDATE means you have an extra step to perform in your program; you'll  have to add a SELECT statement before each UPDATE or DELETE to explicitly lock the rows  you intend to affect. This will allow you to detect if another user has already locked the desired  rows by making your program wait to acquire the lock. However, this will still not solve the  integrity problem completely, because you won't see if rows you are about to INSERT have  already been inserted. In addition, your SELECT statement will wait indefinitely until it can acquire  a lock. So, for the FOR UPDATE clause to be useful as a means of detecting if another session  has a lock on something for which you wish to acquire a lock, you'll have to use it with the  NOWAIT modifier.    If you execute a SELECT statement with FOR UPDATE NOWAIT, and it can't acquire a lock  immediately, it will generate an SQLException with the Oracle error "ORA-00054: resource  busy and acquire with NOWAIT specified." You can then use the generation of this error to  control how you respond when a row you want is already locked by another session. Using  explicit locks to maintain update integrity requires a great deal of additional programming effort  and works only if every application that updates the database uses the technique. And that's  unlikely!   18.1.3 Table Locking  Now that you know how to explicitly lock rows, let's look at how to lock an entire table. Locking an  entire table is a very high-contention action. Regardless of locking mode, no other user on the  system will be able to modify the table until you end your transaction, so use this approach only  as a last resort. In 15 years of using Oracle and building applications, I have had only one  instance in which it was necessary to lock an entire table. The LOCK TABLE command syntax is:   lock table table_name in mode [nowait]  which breaks down as:  table_name    The name of the table you wish to lock   mode    One of five possible lock modes:   share   share update   exclusive   row share   row exclusive    nowait    An optionally specified modifier that makes the LOCK TABLE command return an error if  it cannot acquire the lock immediately     Although you can lock an entire table, another user can still queue an update that will wait until  your transaction is finished with no knowledge of the changes you are making while the table is  locked, and hence, no update detection. By now you must be coming to the realization that  locking alone does not ensure data integrity. But just in case you aren't fully convinced, let's take  a look at an example that proves my point.   18.1.4 Locks Alone Don't Solve the Problem  The easiest way to demonstrate that locks alone don't solve the data integrity problem is to open  two SQL*Plus sessions and issue some SQL statements to show how one user can overwrite  another user's updates. For this experiment, we'll use the TEST_TRANS table created in  Chapter 17. If that doesn't exist, and you want to follow along, you'll need to create it now.  Recall that TEST_TRANS has two columns: COL1, which is the table's primary key, and COL2.  Both are VARCHAR2 columns. Let's start our experiment by inserting a new row into  TEST_TRANS from session one:   SQL> insert into test_trans values   '1', 'X'  ;    1 row created.  Then let's commit:  SQL> commit;    Commit complete.  Next, still from session one, let's update the row we just inserted:   SQL> update test_trans set col2 = 'Y' where col1 = '1';    1 row updated.  Now, from session two, let's select the row from TEST_TRANS where COL2 is equal to X:   SQL> select * from test_trans where col2 = 'X';    C C  - -  1 X  At this point, session two knows that the row with a primary key equal to 1 has a value of X. Let's  now say that session two wants the row to have a value of Z in COL2. Unbeknownst to session  two, however, the row no longer has a value of X in COL2. Session one has changed the value of  COL2 to Y, but session two can't see that change because session one has not committed the  change. As far as session two is concerned, the row has the value X. To change that value to Z,  session two executes the following UPDATE statement:   SQL> update test_trans set col2 = 'Z' where col1 = '1';  After issuing this statement, session two waits indefinitely until session one commits, thus  releasing its lock. So let's proceed by committing session one's transaction:   SQL> commit;    Commit complete.  Now session two's update succeeds, and session two also commits its changes:   1 row updated.    SQL> commit;    Commit complete.    If you requery the row from session one, you'll see that the value is not Y, which was just set in  session one, but is instead Z. While this value seems legitimate to session two, it's probably not  the result the session one user expected to see after having just changed the value to Y. What  went wrong? Session two had no opportunity to detect that the row with a value of 1 in COL1 and  a value of X in COL2 no longer had a value of X in COL2, because the original value of COL2  was not used in the WHERE clause of the UPDATE statement it issued to change the value to Z.  To solve this problem, we need to include the original value of COL2 in the WHERE clause as a  form of update detection.   18.2 Detection  Detection, in our current discussion, is the ability to detect if data you are about to modify has  changed since the point when you selected it to be updated. There are several tactics you can  employ for detection. Let me clarify that we are no longer discussing locking, but detection.  Detection is mutually exclusive of locking.    The first two detection tactics we will discuss are pessimistic. By pessimistic, I mean it is  assumed that a user in another session will most likely modify all the columns of a row of data  you just selected to be updated by your program. One pessimistic detection approach is to use an  updatestamp. As an alternative to using an updatestamp, you can compare all the columns of a  table, or attributes of an object, to their original values in the WHERE clause of any UPDATE  statement that you issue.    The third detection tactic is optimistic. It operates under the premise that a user in another  session is not likely to modify the same data that you intend to modify. It entails comparing only  modified columns or attributes in a WHERE clause.    Let's examine each tactic in detail, beginning with an updatestamp.   18.2.1 Using an Updatestamp  An updatestamp is a number column in a table or a number attribute in an object. The database  increments its value by 1 each time you modify a given row or object. That way, you can compare  the updatestamp you retrieved from the database to its current value to detect a modification of  the row or object by another session.    The benefit of using an updatestamp is that it makes formulating a WHERE clause for an  UPDATE statement fairly simple. Typically, you need to include only the primary key and the  updatestamp in the WHERE clause. The drawback is that you have to add code to your  application, or even to the database in the form of triggers, to increment the updatestamp every  time a row or object is updated.    Adding an updatestamp to a row or object also means that you have to add an additional column  or attribute to every table or object type you use in your database. If you find this to be  undesirable, you can use the second detection method, in which you compare all columns and  attributes of the table  or object  that you are updating to their original values in the WHERE  clause of your UPDATE statement.    An Updatestamp Versus a Timestamp   In databases other than Oracle, you might be able to add an additional  column or attribute of a timestamp data type and then have the database  update the timestamp every time a row or object is updated. Then, you  can compare the value of the timestamp in the database to the original  value you retrieved prior to your update in the SQL statement's WHERE    clause. However, this does not work with Oracle because Oracle's  timestamp data type, DATE, holds values only down to the second. In  addition, if you create a custom data type, such as a number, to hold the  time value down to milliseconds, you'll find that Oracle can still perform  several hundred updates within that time frame. So a feasible approach  is to use an updatestamp.    18.2.2 Comparing All Columns or Attributesto Their Original Values  A second detection tactic is to compare all the columns  or attributes  in the table  or object  that  you are updating to their original values. You do this as part of your UPDATE statement in the  WHERE clause; so the UPDATE statement fails if someone else has modified the row in  question. With reference to my earlier example, when session two retrieved the row in which  COL2 contained an X, it found that COL1 was equal to 1. To rewrite session two's UPDATE  statement to include detection, add a comparison of COL2 to its original value. For example:   update test_trans   set col2 = 'Z'   where col1 = '1' and col2 = 'X';  Execute this UPDATE statement from session two in the earlier example, and no rows will be  affected. The reason no rows will be affected is because COL2 has been modified by session one  and is no longer equal to X. You can use the fact that the executeUpdate    method returns 0  for the number of rows affected to determine that the update was not successful. You then know  that the row was changed between the time you selected it and the time you attempted your  update.    The benefit to using all columns or attributes in a WHERE clause is that you don't have to add an  additional updatestamp column or attribute to your tables and objects. The drawback is that you  have to formulate a more complex, and larger, WHERE clause. If a table has 20 columns, you  have to compare all 20 columns to their original values.    One problem with both pessimistic methods of detection is that they prevent more than one user  from updating a row in a table at any point in time without an update failure, in the sense that a  second updator will always fail. Accordingly, we call these low-concurrency methods. The fact  that they essentially check on an entire row or object is what makes them pessimistic.   18.2.3 Comparing Modified Columns or Attributes to Their Original Values  The third method, which provides a high level of concurrency, is to compare only modified  columns to their original values. To facilitate a high amount of concurrency, that is, the ability for  multiple users to update the same row or object without update failure, you can detect changes  that are relevant only to your UPDATE statement by including only the primary key and the  modified columns in the WHERE clause of the UPDATE statement. For example, let's use the  person table we created in Chapter 8. Let's assume that we insert a row:   insert into person           person_id,         last_name,         first_name,         middle_name,         birth_date,         mothers_maiden_name    values           1,         'O''Reilly',           'Tom'         null,         to_date  '19800315', 'YYYYMMDD'  ,         'Unknown'  ;  Let's further assume that two sessions select the values of the row just inserted. After both  sessions select the row, session one executes the following UPDATE statement and commits:   update person  set    first_name = 'Tim'  where  person_id  = 1  and    first_name = 'Tom';  Session two then executes the following UPDATE statement and commits:  update person  set    birth_date = to_date  '19800317', 'YYYYMMDD'     where  person_id  = 1  and    birth_date = to_date  '19800315', 'YYYYMMDD'  ;  Both statements will execute successfully. The trickery here is that while these two UPDATE  statements both update the same row, they each modify different columns in that row. As a result,  they don't overwrite each other's changes during the update. This technique of using the primary  key and modified columns provides the highest amount of concurrency, the least amount of  update failure, and prevents unintended corruption of data due to lack of detection. Since it allows  more than one user to update a row, I consider it an optimistic approach. The downside of this  tactic is that the formulation of WHERE clauses becomes quite complex to code.    Now that you've seen what locking and detection can do individually, let's examine how to  combine them to effectively protect the integrity of updates in a multiuser environment.   18.3 Data Integrity Solutions  Whenever more than one user accesses a database, there is the possibility that one user will  inadvertently overwrite another user's data. As we have seen from this chapter's earlier  discussions, locks alone do not guarantee data integrity. Indeed, some form of change detection  is also needed. In this section, we'll take what we've learned about locking and detection and  formulate two pessimistic solutions and one optimistic solution to maintaining data integrity.   18.3.1 Pessimistic Data Integrity Solutions  Let's start our discussion of maintaining data integrity by taking a look at two pessimistic  approaches. The first is to use row locking by selecting a row FOR UPDATE NOWAIT before  updating it. The second is to use implicit locking and detection.    18.3.1.1 SELECT FOR UPDATE NOWAIT   If every user of a database uses the technique of selecting a row FOR UPDATE with NOWAIT,  then data integrity will be maintained, because a second user will not be able to acquire a lock on  the data until the first has committed his changes. But what about detection? Detection is implicit  in the fact that an application will get an SQLException with Oracle error "ORA-00054" if it  cannot immediately lock the desired row. A row that can't be locked is one that is already being  modified by someone else. Hence, the contention between updates is detected before it even  exists.    Although the SELECT FOR UPDATE NOWAIT approach works well, it has major concurrency  and coding drawbacks. First, as soon as one user locks a row FOR UPDATE, it remains locked  until that person commits or rolls back. This means that if he selects a row, then go on vacation  for two weeks leaving his computer running, the row remains locked until he returns and commits    or rolls back. Now that's a great deal of contention for the same row of data! A workaround to this  problem is to retrieve a row to present its data to a user and then re-retrieve the row FOR  UPDATE NOWAIT after the user has made changes. Then, compare the original values returned  by the first query to those returned by the reselect just before updating the row. This brings us to  another drawback: this method can require a great deal of extra coding. Finally, there is also the  fact that every user of the database must play by the rules in order for this technique to work. A  less contentious tactic is to use pessimistic detection with implicit locking. Let's examine that  tactic next.    18.3.1.2 Pessimistic detection and implicit locking   Pessimistic detection is the use of an updatestamp or of all columns of a table  or all attributes of  an object  in a SQL statement's WHERE clause to detect if changes have occurred in a target  row or object. Implicit locking happens automatically when any INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE  statement is executed. If you combine implicit locking with the use of an updatestamp or with the  checking of all columns, you will maintain data integrity. The drawback to this approach is  straightforward: any change to a row by another session after the row has been selected in your  session will result in an update failure. You'll then have to notify your software user that he will  need to start over, essentially reselecting the data and updating once again.    With the technique described in this section, you get lower contention, because locks occur only  when a change has taken place, but you trade contention for update failures. Since you'll create a  simple WHERE clause, the construction of which is predictable, the coding burden is minimized,  but you trade WHERE clause complexity for the need to notify the user that an update has failed.  Overall, this is a better technique than using explicit locking when you have a large application  with many users. An even better tactic for a large application, however, is to use an optimistic  data integrity solution.   18.3.2 An Optimistic Data Integrity Solution  An optimistic solution to the multiuser data integrity problem is to combine optimistic detection  with implicit locking. In this scenario, you store the original values of columns or attributes when  you retrieve a row or an object and use them in a dynamically constructed WHERE clause when  you later update that row or object. In the WHERE clause, you compare the values of the primary  key, and any modified columns or attributes, to their original values. If the original and new values  all match, you know that no other user has updated the same columns that you yourself are  updating. While dynamic coding of the WHERE clause requires a good deal of programming, the  fact that you employ implicit locking along with optimistic detection provides the highest level of  concurrency while reducing the number of update failures. This technique works regardless of  how other applications use the database. You still have to code update failure notification, but  your program's users will not see many such messages.   18.3.3 Which Approach to Use?  So which data integrity approach is the right tactic for you? Many development tools employ the  pessimistic approaches but suffer when a second or third tool is used to develop against the  same database. With an optimistic approach you can't get into data integrity trouble regardless of  what other tools are used. Ultimately, you have to decide based on how differing technologies  access the same database. Personally, I always choose an optimistic approach. Then I don't  have to be concerned about scalability.    Now that you're an expert at detection and locking and have several tactics you can employ to  maintain data integrity, let's move on to Chapter 19, in which we'll examine myths and facts of  JDBC performance.   Chapter 19. Performance    Performance is usually considered an issue at the end of a development cycle when it should  really be considered from the start. Often, a task called "performance tuning" is done after the  coding is complete, and the end user of a program complains about how long it takes the  program to complete a particular task. The net result of waiting until the end of the development  cycle to consider performance includes the expense of the additional time required to recode a  program to improve its performance. It's my opinion that performance is something that is best  considered at the start of a project.    When it comes to performance issues concerning JDBC programming there are two major factors  to consider. The first is the performance of the database structure and the SQL statements used  against it. The second is the relative efficiency of the different ways you can use the JDBC  interfaces to manipulate a database.    In terms of the database's efficiency, you can use the EXPLAIN PLAN facility to explain how the  database's optimizer plans to execute your SQL statements. Armed with this knowledge, you may  determine that additional indexes are needed, or that you require an alternative means of  selecting the data you desire.    On the other hand, when it comes to using JDBC, you need to know ahead of time the relative  strengths and weaknesses of using auto-commit, SQL92 syntax, and a Statement versus a  PreparedStatement versus a CallableStatement object. In this chapter, we'll examine the  relative performance of various JDBC objects using example programs that report the amount of  time it takes to accomplish a given task. We'll first look at auto-commit. Next, we'll look at the  impact of the SQL92 syntax parser. Then we'll start a series of comparisons of the Statement  object versus the PreparedStatement object versus the CallableStatement object. At the  same time we'll also examine the performance of the OCI versus the Thin driver in each situation  to see if, as Oracle's claims, there is a significant enough performance gain with the OCI driver  that you should use it instead of the Thin driver. For the most part, our discussions will be based  on timing data for 1,000 inserts into the test performance table TESTXXXPERF. There are  separate programs for performing these 1,000 inserts using the OCI driver and the Thin driver.    The performance test programs themselves are very simple and are available online with the rest  of the examples in this book. However, for brevity, I'll not show the code for the examples in this  chapter. I'll only talk about them. Although the actual timing values change from system to  system, their relative values, or ratios from one system to another, remain consistent. The timings  used in this chapter were gathered using Windows 2000. Using objective data from these  programs allows us to come to factual conclusions on which factors improve performance, rather  than relying on hearsay.    I'm sure you'll be surprised at the reality of performance for these objects, and I hope you'll use  this knowledge to your advantage. Let's get started with a look at the testing framework used in  this chapter.   19.1 A Testing Framework  For the most part, the test programs in this chapter report the timings for inserting data into a  table. I picked an INSERT statement because it eliminates the performance gain of the database  block buffers that may skew timings for an UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT statement.    The test table used in the example programs in this chapter is a simple relational table. I wanted it  to have a NUMBER, a small VARCHAR2, a large VARCHAR2, and a DATE column. Table  TESTXXXPERF is defined as:   create table TestXXXPerf    id          number,  code        varchar2 30 ,  descr       varchar2 80 ,    insert_user varchar2 30 ,  insert_date date    tablespace users pctfree 20  storage  initial 1 M next 1 M pctincrease 0  ;    alter table TestXXXPerf  add constraint TestXXXPerf_Pk  primary key   id    using index  tablespace users pctfree 20  storage  initial 1 M next 1 M pctincrease 0  ;  The initial extent size used for the table makes it unlikely that the database will need to take the  time to allocate another extent during the execution of one of the test programs. Therefore, extent  allocation will not impact the timings. Given this background, you should have a context to  understand what is done in each section by each test program.   19.2 Auto-Commit  By default, JDBC's auto-commit feature is on, which means that each SQL statement is  committed as it is executed. If more than one SQL statement is executed by your program, then a  small performance increase can be achieved by turning off auto-commit.    Let's take a look at some numbers. Table 19-1 shows the average time, in milliseconds, needed  to insert 1,000 rows into the TESTXXXPERF table using a Statement object. The timings  represent the average from three runs of the program. Both drivers experience approximately a  one-second loss as overhead for committing between each SQL statement. When you divide that  one second by 1,000 inserts, you can see that turning off auto-commit saves approximately 0.001  seconds  1 millisecond  per SQL statement. While that's not interesting enough to write home  about, it does demonstrate how auto-commit can impact performance.    Table 19-1. Auto-commit timings  in milliseconds     Auto-commit   OCI   Thin   On   Off   3,712   2,613   3,675   2,594   Clearly, it's more important to turn off auto-commit for managing multistep transactions than for  gaining performance. But on a heavily loaded system where many users are committing  transactions, the amount of time it takes to perform commits can become quite significant. So my  recommendation is to turn off auto-commit and manage your transactions manually. The rest of  the tests in this chapter are performed with auto-commit turned off.   19.3 SQL92 Token Parsing  Like auto-commit, SQL92 escape syntax token parsing is on by default. In case you don't recall,  SQL92 token parsing allows you to embed SQL92 escape syntax in your SQL statements  see  Section 9.3.3 in Chapter 9 . These standards-based snippets of syntax are parsed by a JDBC  driver transforming the SQL statement into its native syntax for the target database. SQL92  escape syntax allows you to make your code more portable -- but does this portability come with  a cost in terms of performance?    Table 19-2 shows the number of milliseconds needed to insert 1,000 rows into the  TESTXXXPERF table. Timings are shown with the SQL92 escape syntax parser on and off for    both the OCI and Thin drivers. As before, these timings represent the result of three program runs  averaged together.    Table 19-2. SQL92 token parser timings  in milliseconds     SQL92 parser   OCI   Thin   On   Off   2,567   2,744   2,514   2,550   Notice from Table 19-2 that with the OCI driver we lose 177 milliseconds when escape syntax  parsing is turned off, and we lose only 37 milliseconds when the parser is turned off with the Thin  driver. These results are the opposite of what you might intuitively expect. It appears that both  drivers have been optimized for SQL92 parsing, so you should leave it on for best performance.    Now that you know you never have to worry about turning the SQL92 parser off, let's move on to  something that has some potential for providing a substantial performance improvement.   19.4 Statement Versus PreparedStatement  There's a popular belief that using a PreparedStatement object is faster than using a  Statement object. After all, a prepared statement has to verify its metadata against the  database only once, while a statement has to do it every time. So how could it be any other way?  Well, the truth of the matter is that it takes about 65 iterations of a prepared statement before its  total time for execution catches up with a statement. This has performance implications for your  application, and exploring these issues is what this section is all about.    When it comes to which SQL statement object performs better under typical use, a Statement  or a PreparedStatement, the truth is that the Statement object yields the best performance.  When you consider how SQL statements are typically used in an application -- 1 or 2 here,  maybe 10-20  rarely more  per transaction -- you realize that a Statement object will perform  them in less time than a PreparedStatement object. In the next two sections, we'll look at this  performance issue with respect to both the OCI driver and the Thin driver.   19.4.1 The OCI Driver   Table 19-3 shows the timings in milliseconds for 1 insert and 1,000 inserts in the  TESTXXXPERF table. The inserts are done first using a Statement object and then a  PreparedStatement object. If you look at the results for 1,000 inserts, you may think that a  prepared statement performs better. After all, at 1,000 inserts, the PreparedStatement object  is almost twice as fast as the Statement object, but if you examine Figure 19-1, you'll see a  different story.    Table 19-3. OCI driver timings  in milliseconds     Inserts   Statement   PreparedStatement   1   1,000   10   2,804   113   1,412   Figure 19-1 is a graph of the timings needed to insert varying numbers of rows using both a  Statement object and a PreparedStatement object. The number of inserts begins at 1 and    climbs in intervals of 10 up to a maximum of 150 inserts. For this graph and for those that follow,  the lines themselves are polynomial trend lines with a factor of 2. I chose polynomial lines instead  of straight trend lines so you can better see a change in the performance as the number of inserts  increases. I chose a factor of 2 so the lines have only one curve in them. The important thing to  notice about the graph is that it's not until about 65 inserts that the PreparedStatement object  outperforms the Statement object. 65 inserts! Clearly, the Statement object is more efficient  under typical use when using the OCI driver.    Figure 19-1. OCI driver timings   19.4.2 The Thin Driver      If you examine Table 19-4  which shows the same timings as for Table 19-3, but for the Thin  driver  and Figure 19-2  which shows the data incrementally , you'll see that the Thin driver  follows the same behavior as the OCI driver. However, since the Statement object starts out  performing better than the PreparedStatement object, it takes about 125 inserts for the  PreparedStatement to outperform Statement.    Table 19-4. Thin driver timings  in milliseconds     Inserts   Statement   PreparedStatement   1   1,000   10   2,583   113   1,739   Figure 19-2. Thin driver timings       When you consider typical SQL statement usage, even with the Thin driver, you'll get better  performance if you execute your SQL statements using a Statement object instead of a  PreparedStatement object. Given that, you may ask: why use a PreparedStatement at all?  It turns out that there are some reasons why you might use a PreparedStatement object to  execute SQL statements. First, there are several types of operations that you simply can't  perform without a PreparedStatement object. For example, you must use a  PreparedStatement object if you want to use large objects like BLOBs or CLOBs or if you wish  to use object SQL. Essentially, you trade some loss of performance for the added functionality of  using these object technologies. A second reason to use a PreparedStatement is its support  for batching.   19.5 Batching  As you saw in the previous section, PreparedStatement objects eventually become more  efficient than their Statement counterparts after 65-125 executions of the same statement. If  you're going to execute a given SQL statement a large number of times, it makes sense from a  performance standpoint to use a PreparedStatement object. But if you're really going to do  that many executions of a statement, or perhaps more than 50, you should consider batching.  Batching is more efficient because it sends multiple SQL statements to the server at one time.  Although JDBC defines batching capability for Statement objects, Oracle supports batching only  when Prepared-Statement objects are used. This makes some sense. A SQL statement in a  PreparedStatement object is parsed once and can be reused many times. This naturally lends  itself to batching.   19.5.1 The OCI Driver   Table 19-5 lists Statement and batched PreparedStatement timings, in milliseconds, for 1  insert and for 1,000 inserts. At the low end, one insert, you take a small performance hit for  supporting batching. At the high end, 1,000 inserts, you've gained 75% throughput.    Table 19-5. OCI driver timings  in milliseconds     Inserts   Statement   Batched   1   1,000   10   2,804   117   691   If you examine Figure 19-3, a trend line analysis of the Statement object versus the batched  PreparedStatement object, you'll see that this time, the batched Prepared-Statement    object becomes more efficient than the Statement object at about 50 inserts. This is an  improvement over the prepared statement without batching.    Figure 19-3. OCI driver timings for batched SQL      There's a catch here. The 8.1.6 OCI driver has a defect by  which it does not support standard Java batching, so the  numbers reported here were derived using Oracle's  proprietary batching.          Now, let's take a look at batching in conjunction with the Thin driver.   19.5.2 The Thin Driver  The Thin driver is even more efficient than the OCI driver when it comes to using batched  prepared statements. Table 19-6 shows the timings for the Thin driver using a Statement  object versus a batched PreparedStatement object in milliseconds for the specified number of  inserts.    Table 19-6. Thin driver timings  in milliseconds     Inserts   Statement   Batched   1   1,000   10   2,583   117   367   The Thin driver takes the same performance hit on the low end, one insert, but gains a whopping  86% improvement on the high end. Yes, 1,000 inserts in less than a second! If you examine  Figure 19-4, you'll see that with the Thin driver, the use of a batched PreparedStatement  object becomes more efficient than a Statement object more quickly than with the OCI driver --  at about 40 inserts.    Figure 19-4. Thin driver timings for batched SQL       If you intend to perform many iterations of the same SQL statement against a database, you  should consider batching with a PreparedStatement object.    We've finished looking at improving the performance of inserts, updates, and deletes. Now let's  see what we can do to squeak out a little performance while selecting data.   19.6 Predefined SELECT Statements  Every time you execute a SELECT statement, the JDBC driver makes two round trips to the  database. On the first round trip, it retrieves the metadata for the columns you are selecting. On  the second round trip, it retrieves the actual data you selected. With this in mind, you can improve  the performance of a SELECT statement by 50% if you predefine the SELECT statement by  using Oracle's defineColumnType    method with an OracleStatement object  see  Section 9.4.2 in Chapter 9 . When you predefine a SELECT statement, you provide the JDBC  driver with the column metadata using the defineColumnType    method, obviating the need  for the driver to make a round trip to the database for that information. Hence, for a singleton  SELECT, you eliminate half the work when you predefine the statement.    Table 19-7 shows the timings in milliseconds required to select a single row from the  TESTXXXPERF table. Timings are shown for when the column type has been predefined and  when it has not been predefined. Timings are shown for both the OCI and Thin drivers. Although  the defineColumnType    method shows little improvement with either driver in my test, on a  loaded network, you'll see a differentiation in the timings of about 50%. Given a situation in which  you need to make several tight calls to the database using a Statement, a predefined SELECT  statement can save you a significant amount of time.    Table 19-7. Select timings  in milliseconds     Driver   Statement   defineColumnType      OCI   Thin   13   13   10   10   Now that we've looked at auto-commit, SQL92 parsing, prepared statements, and a predefined  SELECT, let's take a look at the performance of callable statements.   19.7 CallableStatements    As you may recall, CallableStatement objects are used to execute database stored  procedures. I've saved CallableStatement objects until last, because they are the slowest  performers of all the JDBC SQL execution interfaces. This may sound counterintuitive, because  it's commonly believed that calling stored procedures is faster than using SQL, but that's simply  not true. Given a simple SQL statement, and a stored procedure call that accomplishes the same  task, the simple SQL statement will always execute faster. Why? Because with the stored  procedure, you not only have the time needed to execute the SQL statement but also the time  needed to deal with the overhead of the procedure call itself.    Table 19-8 lists the relative time, in milliseconds, needed to call the stored procedure  TESTXXXPERF$.SETTESTXXXPERF   . This stored procedure inserts one row into the table  TESTXXXPERF. Timings are provided for both the OCI and Thin drivers. Notice that both drivers  are slower when inserting a row this way than when using either a statement or a batched  prepared statement  refer to Tables Table 19-3 through Table 19-6 . Common sense will tell  you why. The SETTESTXXXPERF    procedure inserts a row into the database. It does exactly  the same thing that the other JDBC objects did but with the added overhead of a round trip for  executing the remote procedure call.    Table 19-8. Stored procedure call timings  in milliseconds     Inserts   OCI   Thin   1   1,000   113   1,723   117   1,752   Stored procedures do have their uses. If you have a complex task that requires several SQL  statements to complete, and you encapsulate those SQL statements into a stored procedure that  you then call only once, you'll get better performance than if you executed each SQL statement  separately from your program. This performance gain is the result of your program not having to  move all the related data back and forth over the network, which is often the slowest part of the  data manipulation process. This is how stored procedures are supposed to be used with Oracle --  not as a substitute for SQL, but as a means to perform work where it can be done most efficiently.   19.8 OCI Versus Thin Drivers  Oracle's documentation states that you should use the OCI driver for maximum performance and  the Thin driver for maximum portability. However, I recommend using the Thin driver all the time.  Let's take a look at some numbers from Windows 2000.  Table 19-9 lists all the statistics we've  covered in this chapter.    Table 19-9. OCI versus Thin driver timings  in milliseconds     Metric   OCI   Thin   1,000 inserts with auto-commit   1,000 inserts with manual commit   1 insert with Statement   1,000 inserts with Statement   3,712   2,613   10   3,675   2,594   10   2,804   2,583    1 insert with PreparedStatement   1,000 inserts batched   SELECT   Predefined SELECT   1 insert with CallableStatement   1,000 inserts with CallableStatement   Totals   113   1,482   10   10   113   113   367   10   10   117   1,723   1,752   12,590   11,231   As you can see from Table 19-9, the Thin driver clearly outperforms the OCI driver for every  type of operation except executions of CallableStatement objects. On a Unix platform, my  experience has been that the CallableStatement numbers are tilted even more in favor of the  OCI driver. Nonetheless, you can feel completely comfortable using the Thin driver in almost any  setting. The Thin driver has been well-tuned by Oracle's JDBC development team to perform  better than its OCI counterpart.   Chapter 20. Troubleshooting  In this chapter, we'll finish up by taking a look at common stumbling blocks for JDBC  programmers using Oracle. Then we'll look at the tools available to help determine the source of  your grief when your programs don't work, and conclude with a look at what Oracle has to offer in  the near future. Let's start with the "gotchas," those pesky details that'll drive you crazy if you  don't pay attention to detail.   20.1 The "Gotchas"  You know them! Those little details that are documented, but for some reason, you ignore them  until they pop up their ugly heads and say, "Gotcha!" Until you've had your own round with them,  you often pay no heed to the letter of the documentation. Even worse, sometimes the  documentation is wrong! In the next few sections, we'll look at the most common stumbling blocks  and resource killers. Let's begin where all new Java programmers suffer, the "Class not found"  message.   20.1.1 Class XXX Not Found  "Class XXX not found" is a classic compile-time error message that tells you that one of the class  names in your source code is not identifiable. It's likely that you've misspelled a class name and  even more likely that you're missing an import statement. For example, if you remove the  import statement for the java.sql package from Example 2-1, you'll get the following error  messages when you compile that program:   TestOCIApp.java:6: Class SQLException not found in throws.    throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {                                   ^  TestOCIApp.java:11: Class Connection not found.    Connection conn =    ^  TestOCIApp.java:12: Undefined variable or class name: DriverManager      DriverManager.getConnection        ^  TestOCIApp.java:15: Class Statement not found.     Statement stmt = conn.createStatement    ;     ^  TestOCIApp.java:16: Class ResultSet not found.     ResultSet rset = stmt.executeQuery      ^  TestOCIApp.java:20: Variable rset may not have been initialized.     rset.close    ;     ^  6 errors  Wow! Six errors simply because you forgot to add import java.sql.*; to your source file. If  you get a "Class not found" message for a class, and you're not sure what your import  statement for that class should be, open up the API documentation and search for the class you  are using. The package name will be documented with the class.    Typically, when you import a package, you can begin with the import keyword, follow it with the  package name, and then append .* to import all classes in the package. Sometimes, however,  that doesn't work as you expect. For example, if you want to use the Date class from the  java.util package and the java.sql package in the same program, you'll probably use an  import statement for the package you use a lot of classes from, i.e., java.sql.*;, and then  fully qualify the class name for the class from the other package in order to resolve ambiguity. For  example, you might import java.sql.*, use Date for the value returned from the database, and  use the fully-qualified java.util.Date to refer to the Date class from the java.util  package.    Next, let's look at what happens when you're missing class files at runtime.   20.1.2 A Missing JDBC Jar File  You may be able to successfully compile your program without a "Class not found" error, but  when you run it you may get a ClassNotFoundException. To understand what's wrong, you  must understand that JDBC is defined as a set of interfaces. These interfaces are resolved at  runtime by DriverManager, which loads the appropriate implementation of the database and  JDBC version you are using. If the necessary class files that implement the JDBC interfaces can't  be loaded at runtime, then the program will generate an exception such as the following:   Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:  oracle.jdbc.driver.  OracleDriver          at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run URLClassLoader.java:202            at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged Native Method            at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass URLClassLoader.java:191           at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass ClassLoader.java:290            at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass Launcher.java:286            at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass ClassLoader.java:247            at java.lang.Class.forName0 Native Method           at java.lang.Class.forName Class.java:124           at TestOCIApp.main TestOCIApp.java, Compiled Code    This type of ClassNotFoundException is typically a problem when you are missing the  appropriate java library jar  or zip  file in your class path. For Oracle 8.1.6, that file is  classes12.zip. In fact, I generated the previous error message by removing classes12.zip from  the class path and executing a JDBC program. Double-check your class path, your package  library structure, and the spelling of any dynamically loaded class any time you get a  ClassNotFoundException.     20.1.3 A Bad Database URL  After you've successfully compiled your program and dynamically loaded the JDBC driver, your  next likely headache is a malformed database URL. The database URL you specify is used by  DriverManager to find and use the appropriate implementation classes. If you make a mistake  when formulating a database URL such that DriverManager cannot find a matching  implementation, you'll get the rather annoying "No suitable driver" message. For example, the  following error is the result of misspelling oracle as xracle in  jdbc:xracle:oci8:@dssnt01:   Exception in thread "main" java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver           at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection DriverManager.java:477           at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection DriverManager.java:137            at TestOCIApp.main TestOCIApp.java, Compiled Code    To generate the next example, I used the URL jdbc:oracle:oci9:@dssnt01, which  misspells the subprotocol name oci8 as oci9. This time, DriverManager can't find the  subprotocol in the loaded driver, oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver, so the driver itself  generates the "Invalid Oracle URL" message to warn you that the subprotocol name is not  supported:   Exception in thread "main" java.sql.SQLException: Invalid Oracle URL  specified:  OracleDriver.connect          at  oracle.jdbc.dbaccess.DBError.throwSqlException DBError.java:114            at  oracle.jdbc.dbaccess.DBError.throwSqlException DBError.java:156           at oracle.jdbc.dbaccess.DBError.check_error DBError.java:775            at  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver.connect OracleDriver.java:143            at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection DriverManager.java:457            at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection DriverManager.java:137           at TestOCIApp.main TestOCIApp.java, Compiled Code    As you can see from these last two examples, you must be exact when specifying database  URLs. There's no margin for error, only anguish as you stare blankly at your code and wonder  what in the heck is wrong with Oracle's JDBC driver when it doesn't work. Then, minutes later,  you come to the painful conclusion that, like most programmers, you can't type or spell worth a  damn. I myself have at least three favorite spellings for the word oracle, but DriverManager  recognizes only one. Be careful and double-check your database URLs.   20.1.4 Explicitly Closing JDBC Objects  If you don't like memory leaks, running out of cursors, or running out of connections, then you'd  better call the close    method on any Oracle JDBC resource you open. Contrary to to  standard JDBC documentation, Oracle JDBC objects -- such as Connection, Statement,  ResultSet, PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement -- do not have finalizer  methods. If you don't explicitly call the close    method for each of these objects as soon as  you are done with them, your programs are likely to run out of resources, and you're likely to go  mad wondering why.    Go one step further and be certain that the close    method gets called; always code a  finally clause for any try-catch block making JDBC calls. In that finally clause, close  any JDBC resources that will no longer be needed should an error occur. In addition to invoking  the close    method on a resource, assign it a null afterwards, so that it will immediately    become eligible for garbage collection. Doing these things will keep your programs nice and tidy,  and keep you from wanting to pull your hair out.   20.1.5 Running Out of Connections  Even if you're a good programmer and close all your resources after you're finished using them,  there's still a chance that you can run out of connections. Platform limitations may prevent you  from opening more than 16 OCI connections per process. There are several things you can check  if you find you can't open a connection. First, see if you've exceeded the maximum number of  processes specified in the server initialization file. If so, that means you have to dig out the DBA  manual. Second, verify that your operating system's per-process file descriptor limit has not been  exceeded by examining your operating system's settings. If it has, then once again, you have to  dig out the manual.   20.1.6 Boolean Parameters in PL SQL  If you write stored procedures using PL SQL and make use of boolean parameters, you won't be  able to call these stored procedures using JDBC. That's because Oracle does not support a SQL  BOOLEAN data type. The workaround is to create wrapper functions or procedures that return  another data type instead of BOOLEAN. For example, instead of returning a BOOLEAN true or  false, you might return integers 1 and 0. Yes, it's an ugly solution, but it works. When you write  your wrapper function or procedure, you can take advantage of PL SQL's ability to do method  overloading, and therefore, use the same function or procedure name but replace your  BOOLEAN parameters with NUMBERs.   20.1.7 The Evil CHAR Data Type   Don't use the CHAR data type. Use the VARCHAR2 data type instead. Why? Because using  CHAR, which is fixed-length and right-padded with spaces, leads to all kinds of grief. Let's take a  look at two specific problems you will encounter if you use CHAR.    The first problem involves comparing a CHAR column with a VARCHAR2 column in a SQL  statement's WHERE clause. The comparison semantics used when a CHAR value is involved  may surprise you and may lead to unexpected, and undesired, results. Consider, for example, a  CHAR 13  column in which you store the value "O'Reilly". Because the column is a CHAR  column, it is right-padded with spaces, and the actual value is "O'Reilly ". A VARCHAR2 13   column, on the other hand, has the value "O'Reilly"  no padding . When you compare the  CHAR 13  "O'Reilly " with the VARCHAR2 13  "O'Reilly", such as you might do when  joining two tables, you'll find that Oracle doesn't consider the two values to be equal, and your  join fails. Even though you initially stored the same value  "O'Reilly"  into both columns, they  aren't seen as equal because of the difference in data types. To work around this problem, you  have to use a function on one of the two columns. You can use rtrim    on the CHAR 13   column or rpad    on the VARCHAR 13  column. You also need to use the setFixedCHAR     method instead of setString    when setting values for a CHAR column in a WHERE  clause. Either way, you negate the possibility of using an index for your join, and your  performance goes out the window. If that doesn't turn your stomach, then maybe the next  problem will.    The second problem with the CHAR data type is if it is used as an IN OUT or OUT variable in a  stored procedure. By default, Oracle's JDBC drivers will right-pad any CHAR value with enough  spaces to make the value 32,767 bytes in length. Ugh! You can work around this problem by  using the Statement object's setMaxFieldSize    method. But this sets the maximum field  size for all character data types, which can lead to other problems. So the real solution is to  simply avoid using CHAR data types.     20.2 Unsupported Features  Oracle's JDBC implementation is quite complete except for a handful of fairly insignificant  features. These features are part of the JDBC specification but are not implemented by Oracle.  Even though they are not significant, it's important for you to know what these features are, so  you don't think that you have a bug in a program when what you are really encountering is a  problem from an attempt to use an unimplemented feature.   20.2.1 Named Cursors  A named cursor allows you to use a SQL-positioned UPDATE or DELETE using the cursor's  name. However, with Oracle, the ResultSet object's getCursorName    method and the  Statement object's setCursorName    method are not supported. If you call this method,  you'll get a SQLException.   20.2.2 SQL92 Join Syntax  SQL92 join syntax is not supported. You need to use Oracle's join syntax. For outer joins you  need to use Oracle's syntax involving the  +  character sequence. To left outer join you need to  append  +  to the column on the lefthand side of the equal sign  =  for the columns specified in a  WHERE clause. For a right outer join you need to append  +  to the righthand columns in a  WHERE clause. The  +  character sequence denotes the optional table.    For example, to right outer join table A to table B on column code, your SQL statement will look  something like this:   select a.name,          b.descr  from   A,         B  where  a.code = b.code + ;  This SELECT statement will return all names from table A with all available descr values from  table B.   20.2.3 PL SQL Boolean, Table, and Record Types  The PL SQL data types, BOOLEAN, RECORD, and TABLE, are not supported by JDBC. To use  BOOLEAN types, you'll need to create a wrapper stored procedure that passes integer values  instead of BOOLEAN values. As for RECORD and TABLE data types, it is best to store such  values in a temporary table from the stored procedure in which you desire to pass these values  and then retrieve them using a SELECT statement in the calling program.   20.2.4 IEEE 754 Floating-Point Compliance  Oracle's NUMBER data type does not comply with the IEEE 754 standard that Java follows.  Instead of complying with the standard, NUMBER guarantees 38 digits of precision, and 0,  negative infinity, and positive infinity have an exact representation. This variation from the  standard can cause minor differences in computations between Oracle and Java.    Oracle's JDBC does not consistently represent the Java NaN  Not a Number  constant for a float  or double and does not throw a SQLException if you try to store a float or double with the NaN  value, so don't store this value from your Java programs.   20.2.5 Catalog Arguments to DatabaseMetadata    Since Oracle needed a means to pass package names and does not have multiple catalogs, the  catalog field is used to pass package names in calls to the DatabaseMetaData object's  getProcedures    and getProcedureColumns    methods. If you specify an empty string   ""  for a catalog using either method, you'll get standalone functions and procedures, which  have no package name. If you pass null or "%", you'll get both standalone and packaged  functions and procedures. Otherwise, pass a package name pattern using the SQL wildcard  characters  either % or _  to retrieve the functions and procedures for a particular package or set  of packages.   20.2.6 SQLWarning  Oracle JDBC drivers support SQLWarning only for scrollable ResultSets.   20.3 Debugging  So far in this chapter, I've tried to build an awareness of those things that can cause common  problems when using JDBC with Oracle. Now it's time to become familiar with good programming  practices and with the features available to help debug your JDBC programs. The first of these is  handling a thrown SQLException.   20.3.1 Handling SQLExceptions  With JDBC, error conditions are communicated via a thrown SQLException. Errors can  originate in the database or in your client application. Either way, they throw a SQLException.  Therefore, it's good programming practice to always block each SQL operation with a try- catch-finally clause. In the catch clause you catch a SQLException. When a  SQLException occurs, you have four methods available to you to get further information about  the error:   getMessage       Returns the error message associated with a SQLException. If the message originates  in the database, it will be prefixed by ORA-XXXXX, in which XXXXX represents an  Oracle error number. If an error originates from the JDBC driver, the error message  returned by getMessage    won't have an ORA-XXXXX prefix.    getErrorCode       getSQLState       printStackTrace       Returns the five digits of an ORA-XXXXX number from the Oracle error whether the error  occurred in your client application or the database.    Returns a five-digit SQL state code if the error originated from the database. Otherwise,  this method returns null.    Prints the current program stack to standard error.   Of these four methods, getMessage    is the most useful. When you combine it with a  standard message format of your own design that identifies the name of the class and shows  which SQL statement was executed, you can provide very meaningful information for debugging  purposes. In order to provide a copy of the SQL statement that was executed, you need to create  a String variable or better yet, a StringBuffer variable prior to your try-catch-finally  clause to hold the contents of your SQL statement. Then it will be available for printing in your  catch block. Example 20-1 demonstrates what we've been discussing. A variable named sql  is created prior to the try-catch-finally clause to hold the SQL statement.     Example 20-1. Handling a thrown SQLException   import java.sql.*;    class HandlingSQLExceptions {     public static void main  String args[]      throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {      Class.forName "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" ;     Or you can use:     DriverManager.registerDriver new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver      ;      Connection conn =      DriverManager.getConnection       "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl","scott","tiger" ;     System.out.println "Connection opened." ;        StringBuffer sql = new StringBuffer         sql.append "select 'Hello Thin driver tester 'USER'!' result " ;     sql.append "from   xdual" ;    Statement stmt = null;    ResultSet rset = null;    try {     stmt = conn.createStatement    ;     rset = stmt.executeQuery sql ;     while rset.next            System.out.println rset.getString 1  ;     rset.close    ;     rset = null;     stmt.close    ;     stmt = null;    }    catch  SQLException e  {     System.err.println "SQLException: " + e.getMessage  .trim     ;     System.err.println "in HandlingSQLExceptions while executing: " ;      System.err.println sql ;    }    finally {     if  rset != null  try { rset.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore   { }     if  stmt != null  try { stmt.close    ; } catch  SQLException ignore   { }    }    conn.close    ;    System.out.println "Connection closed." ;   }  }  In Example 20-1, the JDBC statements for creating and executing the SQL statement, along  with the JDBC statements for retrieving the data from the result set, are all in the same try  block. In the example, I've purposely misspelled the name of the table dual as xdual to cause a  SQLException. When the program executes, the code in the catch block produces the  following error message:   SQLException: ORA-00942: table or view does not exist  in HandlingSQLExceptions while executing:    select 'Hello Thin driver tester 'USER'!' result from xdual   The kind of information in this message is what you'll need to debug your programs. Now that you  have a framework for handling a thrown SQLException, let's look at another facility that may  help you: connection logging.   20.3.2 Logging DriverManager Connections   Connection logging is a facility provided by DriverManager that allows you to write a log of your  JDBC activities to a host's filesystem. If you're having problems with establishing a connection,  connection logging may be helpful. Enable connection logging by calling the DriverManager  object's setLogWriter    method, passing it a PrintWriter object. For example, to enable  DriverManager connection logging to System.err, code the following:   DriverManager.setLogWriter new java.io.PrintWriter System.err  ;   Set the log writer before you try to establish a connection. Then, when you attempt to establish a  connection, DriverManager will log its actions to the specified stream. Here's the output from a  successful connection:   DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2 k01:1521:orcl"       trying  driver[className=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver,oracle.jdbc.driver.   OracleDriver@e8af3995]  getConnection returning  driver[className=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver,oracle.jdbc.   driver.  OracleDriver@e8af3995]  If you misspell thin as thim, you'll get output such as the following:   DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:oracle:thim:@dssw2k01:1521:orcl"        trying  driver[className=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver,oracle.jdbc.driver.   OracleDriver@e8af3efc]  getConnection failed: java.sql.SQLException: Invalid Oracle URL  specified:   OracleDriver.connect  This time we've specified a port number other than the port on which the listener is listening:   DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:oracle:thin:@dssw2k01:1525:orcl"        trying  driver[className=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver,oracle.jdbc.driver.   OracleDriver@e8a23f8b]  getConnection failed: java.sql.SQLException: Io exception: The Network   Adapter could not establish the connection  Due to the overhead of using connection logging, I suggest you use it only for troubleshooting. It's  worth noting that you get only slightly more information from connection logging than you do from  a call to printStackTrace   .   20.3.3 Logging DataSource Connections  You can enable the same logging facility for a DataSource as for a DriverManager by calling  the DataSource object's setLogWriter    method, passing it a PrintWriter object. The  pattern is the same as that used for the DriverManager object's setLogWriter    method. If  you get your DataSource from a JNDI server, you must set the log writer for each DataSource  after you get it from JNDI, even if you set it before it was serialized into the JNDI directory. This is    because the PrintWriter object is transient, and therefore, cannot be serialized. Here's  abbreviated output from a successful connection:   DRVR OPER Enabled logging  moduleMask 0x0fffffff, categoryMask  0x0fffffff   DRVR DBG1 User us scottURL is jdbc:oracle:thin:  @ DESCRIPTION= ADDRESS= PROTOCOL=tcp  PORT=1521  HOST=dssw2k01   CONNECT _  DATA= SID=orcl     DRVR FUNC OracleConnection.OracleConnection access,  ur="jdbc:oracle:thin:  @ DESCRIPTION= ADDRESS= PROTOCOL=tcp  PORT=1521  HOST=dssw2k01   CONNECT _  DATA= SID=orcl   ", us="scott", p="tiger",   db=" DESCRIPTION= ADDRESS= PROTOCOL=tcp  PORT=1521  HOST=dssw2k01    CONN ECT_  DATA= SID=orcl   ", info   DRVR FUNC OracleConnection.initialize ur="jdbc:oracle:thin:   @ DESCRIPTION= ADDRESS= PROTOCOL=tcp  PORT=1521  HOST=dssw2k01   CONNECT _  DATA= SID=orcl   ", us="scott", access   . . .

It provides a great deal of information about the  connection and the SELECT statement's execution, including the Oracle character set to UCS-2  conversion. Considering the size of the output file, enabling logging equates to a substantial  performance hit.   20.4 Net8 Tracing  If you use the OCI driver, you can configure Net8 to trace your database communications. You  can enable Net8 tracing on both the client and the server. Keep in mind, however, that enabling  Net8 tracing translates into a substantial performance hit.   20.4.1 Client-Side Tracing  To enable client tracing, you add four parameters to your sqlnet.ora file, which is located in your  $ORACLE_HOME\network\admin directory. The first of the four parameters is  TRACE_LEVEL_CLIENT, and you can set it to one of the following four values:   0 or OFF   4 or USER   10 or ADMIN   16 or SUPPORT   For example, to turn tracing on and get the most amount of information, specify the following:   TRACE_LEVEL_CLIENT = SUPPORT  To turn tracing off, which you definitely want to do after your debugging session is complete, use  0 or OFF:   TRACE_LEVEL_CLIENT = OFF  The second parameter, TRACE_DIRECTORY_CLIENT, is used to specify the directory for the  client-side trace files. Typically, this parameter is set as:   TRACE_DIRECTORY_CLIENT = $ORACLE_HOME network trace  You can, however, select any directory you wish as the destination directory for trace files.        On Windows machines, do not set  TRACE_DIRECTORY_CLIENT to the root directory of a drive   e.g., c:\ . If you do so, you won't get any trace files even with  tracing turned on.       The third parameter is TRACE_UNIQUE_CLIENT. This parameter can be set to ON or OFF. If  you set it to OFF, then each session will use and overwrite the trace file. If it is set to ON, then the  driver will append the process ID to the last parameter, TRACE_FILE_CLIENT, to create a  unique trace filename for each session. For example, to overwrite the trace file with each session,  specify the following:   TRACE_UNIQUE_CLIENT = OFF  The last parameter, TRACE_FILE_CLIENT, allows you to specify the name of the overwritten  trace file, or a trace file prefix if you are going to set TRACE_UNIQUE_CLIENT to ON. For  example, to set the overwritten trace file name to CLIENT.TRC, specify the following:   TRACE_FILE_CLIENT = CLIENT.TRC  Or if you want to use TRACE_UNIQUE_CLIENT, specify something like this:   TRACE_FILE_CLIENT = CLI  For troubleshooting JDBC, you want to use client-side tracing at the SUPPORT level with  TRACE_UNIQUE_CLIENT set to OFF. When you do this, you get an exceptionally large trace  file, but it contains packet images, so you can see exactly what has been sent between your  application and the server. Example 20-2 shows a small portion of a trace file produced when  executing TestOCIApp from Chapter 2.   Example 20-2.

In this case, you can see that the application executed a  SQL SELECT statement against the dual table.   20.4.2 Server-Side Tracing  If you can't use the OCI driver on the client, you can still get a trace file by turning on the trace  facility on the server. The server-side trace facility works exactly like the client side's, except that  the parameters have the word CLIENT replaced by SERVER. Otherwise, the same settings  apply.    To enable server-side tracing, you must edit sqlnet.ora on your server machine. When you enable  tracing on the server, you'll get trace files for all sessions connecting to the server; thus, you  might actually wish to use unique filenames with which you set TRACE_FILE_SERVER to a file  prefix, and Oracle adds a session number suffix. This means you need to capture your session  number in your program so you can identify the correct tracing file. Here's an example of server- side settings:   TRACE_LEVEL_SERVER = SUPPORT  TRACE_DIRECTORY_SERVER = $ORACLE_HOME network trace  TRACE_UNIQUE_SERVER = ON  TRACE_FILE_SERVER = SESS   20.5 Wait for the Cure  One way of solving a problem is to simply wait for the cure. With each new release of Oracle's  JDBC drivers, new features are added. Functionality you desire may not yet exist, but it may  arrive in the near future. So let's look at useful features you'll find in Oracle8i 8.1.7 and Oracle9i.   20.5.1 Oracle8i Release 3  Version 8.1.7  Features  With Release 3 of Oracle8i, several new features have been added to Oracle's JDBC support.  Here's a short list showing some of the more important ones:   Statement caching    SQL statements are cached to prevent the overhead of repeated cursor creation.    Access to scalar-based PL SQL tables     You can now pass PL SQL tables created with scalar data types as OUT parameters in  stored procedures.    Complete XA support    XA Recover and XA Forget methods are implemented.   Fixed wait scheme for connection caching    This new scheme makes a requestor wait indefinitely if the maximum limit has been  reached for a connection pool.    Thin driver 56-bit Encryption    The Thin driver now supports 56-bit encryption.   20.5.2 Oracle9i Features  Oracle8i Release 3 is the last update to Oracle8i. Oracle9i is just out, with improvements to  object-relational SQL that allow you to move your application's object model into the database.  Here's a short list of Oracle9i's more important enhancements and new features:   Support for Unicode with NCHAR datatypes    JDBC drivers can measure strings the same way users do, using UCS-2 semantics. The  NCHAR types are redefined to hold Unicode data.    Support for object type inheritance    Database types can be extended. Lack of type inheritance in Oracle's object  implementation has been a stumbling block for moving an application's object model into  the data. With inheritance, making incremental changes to an object should no longer  require recreating an object table.    Support for multilevel collections    You can have collections inside of collections. Single-level collections have also been a  stumbling block for Oracle's object implementation. Now an application's object model  can be completely implemented using Oracle.    Support for SQL accessible objects    Java mapping for database types is now supported in the type DDL. This means Java  objects can be directly inserted, updated, deleted, and selected through the JDBC driver.    Connection management extensions for the OCI driver    These management extensions improve resource consumption of the pooled connection  facilities.    Support for returning REF cursors from Java stored procedures    You can create REF cursors within a Java stored procedure and return those REF  cursors to your Java program through JDBC    XA support for pre-Version 8.1.6 databases    Support for XA now extends to Oracle version 8.0 or higher   As of iAS release 9.0.2, EJB does not run inside the database server JVM.    The CustomDatum interface is being superseded by the ORAData interface. They are  functionally the same except that the ORAData interface expects a connection object obtained  through the DataSource interface.     That's it.

Colophon  Our look is the result of reader comments, our own experimentation, and feedback from  distribution channels. Distinctive covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,  breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.   The animals on the cover of Java Programming with Oracle JDBC are hummingbird moths. As its  name suggests, this moth looks much like a hummingbird at a glance. It feeds by hovering in front  of a flower and sipping nectar through its proboscis  its feeding structure  in much the same way  as the hummingbird. However, at a closer look, the insect's antennae mark it as a moth.  Belonging to the family Sphingidae, this moth is commonly called "hummingbird," "sphinx," or  "hawk moth."   The hummingbird moth is a strong flyer, with a rapid wingbeat. Most are medium to large moths  with heavy bodies, with wing spreads up to five inches. Although few are active in the daytime,  most fly on cloudy days or at dusk. Though most don't cause damage to garden plants, some  feed on tomatoes and tobacco when in caterpillar form. The tomato hornworm, for example, feeds  on potato, tomato, and tobacco plants, and can cause severe economic loss in those crops.  Leaves provide an additional source of food for the moth.

JDBC is the key Java technology for relational database access. Oracle is arguably the most widely used relational database platform in the world. In this book, Donald Bales brings these two technologies together, and shows you how to leverage the full power of Oracle's implementation of JDBC.
