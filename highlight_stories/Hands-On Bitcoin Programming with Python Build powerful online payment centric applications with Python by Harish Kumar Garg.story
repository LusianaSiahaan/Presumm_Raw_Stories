Getting Started with Bitcoin  This chapter focuses on bitcoin, its features, and how can we take part in the bitcoin ecosystem. The bitcoin ecosystem runs by its users getting, spending, and sending bitcoin wallets. In order to understand the concepts of this chapter, you should have at least a basic understanding of the command line on the computer you're using, and you should have Python 3.x installed on your computer.  In this chapter, we will look at the following topics:  Introducing bitcoin and its features Introducing blockchain Attributes of bitcoin and blockchain How to get a bitcoin wallet The different forms of bitcoin wallet including getting, sending, and spending   Introduction to bitcoin and blockchains  In this section, we will explore the following topics:  Bitcoin The uses of bitcoin Blockchains Attributes of bitcoin and blockchain   What is bitcoin?  Bitcoin is a digital currency. This means that it exists only as an electronic record, and, unlike physical currency, you cannot hold it in your hand. You can send and receive money using bitcoin  just as you can with other methods , as well as pay for things and services with bitcoin. Bitcoin is interchangeable with traditional money.  There are exchanges where you can buy and sell bitcoin. There are many other digital currencies, but bitcoin is the first and the most popular. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate, with no central authority or banks managing transactions, and the issuing of bitcoin is carried out collectively by the network.  Bitcoin is open source—its design is public; nobody owns or controls bitcoin, and everybody can use it. Bitcoin is digital and decentralized. For the first time in history, people can exchange value without intermediaries, which translates to greater control of funds and lower fees.  It's a cryptocurrency, which means it's secured by design.   Uses of bitcoin  There are a lot of advantages to using bitcoin. Some of them are as follows:  Fast and easy payments: It's extremely easy and fast to make payments with bitcoin. You do not have to worry about which software to use. The bitcoin network never sleeps, even on holidays. Sending payments internationally is also very easy; there are no banks to make anyone wait three business days, no extra fees for making an international transfer, and no special limitations on the minimum or maximum amount one can send. Privacy: Payment can be made using bitcoin without sharing any personal info; one does not need to sign up or share any card information. In fact, it is even possible to send a payment without revealing one's identity, almost like you can with physical money. However, take note that some effort may be required to protect privacy. Negligible transaction fees: There are very little or minimal transaction fees while making payments with bitcoin. There are no fees to receive bitcoins, and having many wallets allows you to control how large a fee to pay when spending. Most wallets have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster confirmation of your transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it's possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs to send one bitcoin. Secure: Bitcoins are created and held electronically, but there is no credit card number involved that someone can steal as nobody can charge you money on your behalf. The transactions are made using military-grade cryptography and are highly confidential. Bitcoin will provide full access over your money and a high level of protection against almost all types of fraudulent works which involves certain steps. Multisignature: Bitcoin's multisignature feature allows businesses full control over their spending by allowing bitcoins to be spent only if a subset of a group of people authorize the transaction. Great for developers: For developers, bitcoin is the simplest of all payment systems. There are many third-party payment processing services that provide APIs. We don't need to store bitcoins on our server. If you don't use any third-party APIs, you can integrate a bitcoin node directly into your applications, allowing it to become your own bank and payment processor.   What is a blockchain?  In simple terms, a blockchain is a digital ledger. It's a public record of bitcoin transactions arranged in chronological order. It is a permissionless, distributed database based on the bitcoin protocol that maintains a continuously growing list of transactional data records. It is distributed so that each participant has the copy of the whole blockchain. The blockchain is shared between all bitcoin users.  It is used to verify the permanence of bitcoin transactions and to prevent double spending. It is secure and immutable, and it's also hardened against tampering and revision, even by operators of the data store's nodes.  Each blockchain record is enforced cryptographically, and hosts run machines working as data store nodes. A blockchain is made up of blocks. A block is a record in the blockchain that contains and confirms many waiting transactions, as shown at https:  www.blockchain.com explorer:  Roughly every ten minutes, a new block containing transactions is appended to the blockchain through mining. It is a file called the bitcoin blockchain sitting on thousands of computers across the world, perhaps even on your own PC at home. The file contains data about all bitcoin transactions—that is, the payment of bitcoins from one account to another—that have ever happened. This is often called a ledger, and is similar to a bank ledger, which keeps a record of payments.   Attributes of bitcoin and blockchain  Both bitcoin and blockchains have the following similar attributes:  Blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin. It works like a database for all bitcoin transactions, and it keeps all records of bitcoin transactions since the very first transaction. The initial and most widely known application of blockchain technology was the public ledger of transactions for bitcoin. However, digital currencies are not the only use for blockchain technology. Blockchain is a no-trust-based system, which can be used to conduct all kinds of transactions, such as digital contract signing. blockchain technology can be used to create a permanent public transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales, storing rights data by authenticating copyright registration, and so on.  There is even a digital nation founded on blockchain technology, called Bitnation.   Getting a bitcoin wallet  To start making payments with bitcoin, we need a bitcoin wallet. However, before we create a wallet, we should be aware of the following things:  Security: We should take steps to secure our wallet. There are a lot of different features that come with different wallets. You should evaluate all of them and choose whichever is best for you. Volatility: The bitcoin price is volatile and goes up and down, depending on market conditions.  There are a few more things that you need to be aware of. For more information, refer to https:  bitcoin.org en you-need-to -know.   The different forms of bitcoin wallet  Bitcoin wallets come in a lot of different forms. Some of them are listed here:  There are smartphone app wallets, there are online web wallets—for example, blockchain.info and coinbase.info—there are desktop-based wallets for macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems, and there are also dedicated hardware-based wallets. Online web wallets can be accessed from any web browser and from any operating system, so that makes it quite platform-independent:  One of the most popular ones is coinbase.info, where you can purchase and send bitcoins. There are a few others as well, such as BitGo, BTC.com, Coin.Space, GreenAddress, and so on. There are also mobile wallets that you can use from your smartphone. They are available for Android phones, Windows phones, Blackberries, and iOS phones. Some of the most popular ones are breadwallet, Coin.Space, Mycelium, and so on.  There are also wallets that are available for desktop computers running on all operating systems. Some of the popular ones are bitcoin Core, GreenAddress, and BitGo, among others. Bitcoin wallets may require specific hardware solutions, for example, Trezor. Trezor is a hardware wallet that has a lot more security, and we can even sign transactions, connect to an online device, and spend bitcoins from this wallet. It is a separate device, so it's much more secure and less prone to hacking. It is also recommended that you use bitcoin cold storage for a large number of bitcoins. Bitcoin cold storage can be held offline, like in a paper-money wallet. For this purpose, you can get a bitcoin address from bitaddress.org, which can be used to send bitcoins and then store the details offline.   Getting and sending bitcoins  Bitcoins can be bought from an exchange website. One example of an exchange website is Coinbase.info, and bitcoin.org lists a lot of these exchange websites. Some operate globally and some are specific to a particular country or a region, depending on the laws of that country. There are exchanges available for all regions and countries of the world. For example, one of the most popular ones is Coinbase.com. Here, bitcoins can be sent and sold, and you can see your account details, containing information on what bitcoins you hold with them.  You can also buy bitcoins from bitcoin ATMs. One of the best websites to use to find your local bitcoin ATM is https:  coinatmradar.com . For example, the following screenshot shows a map of the United States, where you can see all the available bitcoin ATMs where you can buy bitcoin:  You can also buy bitcoins in person from other users. The locations of people who are interested in selling bitcoins can be found at https:  localbitcoins.com . In the following screenshot, we can see all the people in the United States who are interested in selling bitcoins. Bitcoins can be bought from this site by other users. You can also sell bitcoins to other users who are interested in buying them:   There are also a lot of places where we can spend bitcoins online on products and services. One of the sites to find these places is https:  spendabit.co . From this site, we can search for the products from sellers who accept bitcoins as payment.  For example, when we perform a sample search of toaster in the search bar, it will show all the listings from the sellers who are selling this product and are ready to accept bitcoins as payment.  Another place to find businesses that accept bitcoins is http:  99bitcoins.com. This website contains a list of companies that accept bitcoins as payment. There are a lot of well-known names that are listed, as shown in the following list:  WordPress: Allows people to create blogs Overstock: The online retailer Subway: Accepts bitcoins Microsoft: Users can buy content with bitcoin on Windows store Reddit: Buy premium features with bitcoins  If you are interested in searching for local businesses that accept bitcoins, you can search for them at coinmap.org.   Summary  In this chapter, we were introduced to bitcoin and blockchain technology, and how we can start playing a part in the bitcoin ecosystem. We learned about bitcoin and its features, blockchains, how bitcoin and blockchains work together, and what the difference between them is. We also explored getting a bitcoin wallet and how to start using it.  We learned how to get and send bitcoins, and we learned about the various places to get bitcoins, both online and offline. We looked at how to send bitcoins, and we looked at some places where you can spend bitcoins and buy products and services.  In the next chapter, we will explore the bitcoin and blockchain APIs programmatically, and look at how to get started with mining bitcoins.   Programming Bitcoin and Blockchain with Python  This chapter focuses on using Raspberry Pi Bitcoin tools to program bitcoin with Python and interacting with Blockchain APIs programmatically. The reader will also get a general idea of the process of mining bitcoin and its initial stages.  In this chapter, we will learn about the following topics:  Programming bitcoin using Python Creating a multisignature bitcoin address Blockchain API programming with Python Installing the Blockchain.info Python library Learning to mine bitcoin How to mine bitcoin Increasing difficulties in mining bitcoins   Programming bitcoin with Python  In this section, we are going to introduce the following topics:  The Raspberry Pi Bitcoin tools library and how to start using it How to generate private keys and public keys How to create a simple bitcoin address from the private keys and public keys you generated  To get started with bitcoin using Python, you must install Python 3.x and the bitcoin Python library called Pi Bitcoin tools in the system.   Pi Bitcoin tools library  To install the Pi Bitcoin tools library, open the command-line program and execute the following command:  pip install bitcoin  The best thing about this library is that it does not need to have a bitcoin node on your computer in order for you to start using it.  This library connects to the bitcoin network and pulls data from places such as Blockchain.info.  We shall start by writing the equivalent of a  Hello World program for bitcoin in Python. In the hello_bitcoin.py script, the demonstration of a new bitcoin address is created using Python.  Go through the following steps to run the program:  1.  Import the bitcoin library:  ! usr bin env python ''' Title - Hello Bitcoin This program demonstrates the creation of - private key, - public key - and a bitcoin address. '''   import bitcoin from bitcoin import *  2.  Generate a private key using the random key function:  my_private_key = random_key    3.  Display the private key on the screen:  print "Private Key: %s\n" % my_private_key    How to generate private keys and public keys  With the private key, a public key is generated. Perform this step by passing the private key that was generated to the privtopub function, as shown here:   Generate Public Key my_public_key = privtopub my_private_key  print "Public Key: %s\n" % my_public_key   Now, with the public key, generate a bitcoin address. Do this by passing the public key that is generated to the pubtoaddr function:   Create a bitcoin address my_bitcoin_address = pubtoaddr my_public_key  print "Bitcoin Address: %s\n" % my_bitcoin_address   The following screenshot shows the private key, public key and bitcoin address that is generated:  Bitcoin address A bitcoin address is a single-use token. Just as people use email addresses to send and receive emails, you can use this bitcoin address to send and receive bitcoins. Unlike email addresses, however, people have many different bitcoin addresses, and a unique address should be used for each transaction.   Creating a multisignature bitcoin address  A multisignature address is an address that is associated with more than one private key; therefore, we need to create three private keys.  Go through the following steps to create a multisignature bitcoin address:  1.  Create three private keys:  ! usr bin env python ''' Title - Create multi-signature address  This program demonstrates the creation of Multi-signature bitcoin address. '''  import bitcoin from bitcoin import *   Create Private Keys my_private_key1 = random_key   my_private_key2 = random_key   my_private_key3 = random_key    print "Private Key1: %s" % my_private_key1  print "Private Key2: %s" % my_private_key2  print "Private Key3: %s" % my_private_key3  print '\n'    Create Public keys my_public_key1 = privtopub my_private_key1  my_public_key2 = privtopub my_private_key2  my_public_key3 = privtopub my_private_key3   print "Public Key1: %s" % my_public_key1  print "Public Key2: %s" % my_public_key2  print "Public Key3: %s" % my_public_key3  print '\n'   2.  Create three public keys from those private keys using the privtopub function:  3.  After generating the public keys, create the multisig by passing the three public keys to the mk_  multi-sig_script function. The resulting multisig is passed to the addr script function to create the multisignature bitcoin address.   Create Multi-signature address my_multi_sig = mk_multisig_script my_private_key1, my_private_key2, my_private_key3, 2,3  my_multi_address = scriptaddr my_multi_sig  print "Multi signature address: %s" % my_multi_address   4.  Print the multisignature address and execute the script.  The following screenshot shows the output for the multisig bitcoin address:   Multisignature addresses are useful in organizations where no single individual is trusted with authorising the spending of bitcoins.  You can also look at the preexisting bitcoin addresses' transactional history. We will first get a valid address from Blockchain.info.  The following screenshot shows the copied address of a bitcoin block:  Pass the copied address to the history function, as shown in the following code, along with the output to get the history of the bitcoin address, including the transactional information:  ! usr bin env python ''' Title - Bitcoin Transaction History  This program demonstrates listing history of a bitcoin address. '''  import bitcoin from bitcoin import *  View address transaction history a_valid_bitcoin_address = '329e5RtfraHHNPKGDMXNxtuS4QjZTXqBDg'   print history a_valid_bitcoin_address     Blockchain API programming with Python  Blockchain.info is one of the most popular blockchain and bitcoin network explorers and wallet providers. From the web, you can view the block level and see all the transactions that have happened. For example, by going to this particular block—that is, Block 536081—you can see all the transactions, as well as some other information, as shown in the following screenshot:  The following screenshot shows the statistical data  DATA  Stats . This is great, and useful as well; however, for a developer building applications or performing analysis based on this data, it is important to get this data programmatically:   The following screenshot shows the market data  DATA  Markets :   Installing the Blockchain.info Python library  The following are the steps to install the blockchain Python library:  1.  Open the command-line program on your computer. 2.  Run the pip install blockchain command to install the blockchain library.  The following screenshot shows the installation of bitcoin:   Getting bitcoin exchange rates from Blockchain.info  The following steps shows the method for bitcoin exchange rates:  1.  First, import the exchangerates classes from the blockchain library:  ! usr bin env python   import blockchain library from blockchain import exchangerates  2.  Exchange rates define a get_ticker method, which returns the exchange rates data in a dictionary object. Call this method and save the resulting object. The ticker dictionary object that we have has currency symbols as keys:   get the Bitcoin rates in various currencies ticker = exchangerates.get_ticker    3.  By running over these keys, data about the various rates can be pulled. For example, the latest  bitcoin rates can be obtained in each currency by getting the p15min minimum value:   print the Bitcoin price for every currency print "Bitcoin Prices in various currencies:"  for k in ticker:  print k, ticker[k].p15min   The following screenshot shows the list of currencies and the equivalent bitcoin rate for those currencies at that moment or from the last 15 minutes:   A particular currency can also be converted to bitcoin. For example, you can pass the to_btc method and pass in the currency and the amount that we want to convert to btc, and get the result as bitcoin. The following code shows how to do this for a value of 100 euros:   Getting Bitcoin value for a particular amount and currency btc = exchangerates.to_btc 'EUR', 100  print "\n100 euros in Bitcoin: %s " % btc   The following screenshot shows the output for 100 euros in bitcoin:   Statistics  The next class from the bitcoin blockchain library is called statistics.  There are a number of methods that can be called to get a wide variety of blockchain stats data, for example, as shown in the following screenshot:  You can call the different methods as follows:  Import the relevant class, call the get method on statistics, and save that object. For example, to get the bitcoin trade volume, we should get the trade_volume_btc property from the stats object that was created, as shown in the following code:  ! usr bin env python    import blockchain library from blockchain import statistics   get the stats object stats = statistics.get     get and print Bitcoin trade volume print "Bitcoin Trade Volume: %s\n" % stats.trade_volume_btc   The following screenshot shows the bitcoin trade volume:  To get the total bitcoins mined, call the btc_mined property on stats object, as shown here:   get and print Bitcoin mined print "Bitcoin mined: %s\n" % stats.btc_mined   The following screenshot shows the output of the number of bitcoins mined:  To get the bitcoin market price, use the stats class, call the market price and append that with the particular currency:   get and print Bitcoin market price in usd print "Bitcoin market price: %s\n" % stats.market_price_usd   The current bitcoin price is shown in US dollars as follows:   Block explorer methods  For block explorer methods, start by importing the relevant classes from the blockchain library. To get a particular block, call the get_block method as shown in the following code. It expects a block to be passed in as the parameter.   import blockchain library from blockchain import blockexplorer   get a particular block block = blockexplorer.get_block ''   By taking an example block from the web, from Blockchain.info, copy the hash for this block  Block 536081  and pass it to the get_block method, as shown in the following screenshot:  Now lets get some information about this block. For example, the block fee, block size, and block transactions can be obtained by using fee, size, and transactions properties respectively on the block object created, as shown in the following code:   get a particular block block = blockexplorer.get_block '0000000000000000002e90b284607359f3415647626447643b9b880ee00e41fa'   ! usr bin env python   import blockchain library from blockchain import blockexplorer  print "Block Fee: %s\n" % block.fee  print "Block size: %s\n" % block.size  print "Block transactions: %s\n" % block.transactions    get the latest block block = blockexplorer.get_latest_block    The following screenshot shows the block fee, block size, and block transactions output:   There are also many available features in the Blockchain.info library; there are a few that are more related to, for example, wallets, creating wallets, and so on.

Learning to mine bitcoin  Some features of bitcoin mining are as follows:  Bitcoin mining is the process of adding bitcoin transactional data to bitcoin's global public ledger of past transactions. Each bitcoin miner gets involved with all the other miners in order to gather the outstanding transactions into a block by dealing with specialized analytical and arithmetical problems. In order to gain accuracy and solve the problems, bitcoin miners gain all of the transactions they process.  In addition to transaction fees, miners also receive an additional reward for each block they mine. Anyone can participate in bitcoin mining by running a computer program. In addition to running on traditional computers, some companies have designed specialized bitcoin mining hardware that can process transactions and build blocks much more quickly.  One can choose to mine bitcoin in the cloud on https:  www.bitcoin.com .  The course of these plans shows you that the difficulty of bitcoin mining is increasing, and getting more expensive as time goes by.  Some companies buy specialized hardware to mine bitcoin. One such piece of hardware is the 21 bitcoin computer from a company called 21.co. Hence, this hardware comes preinstalled with the necessary software.   How to mine bitcoin  There is also plenty of bitcoin mining software available, which can run on any machine. However, it may not be as efficient anymore. For example, let's go to http:  www.bitcoinx.com bitcoin-mining-softwar e  for a long list of such software. They can run on all kinds of operating systems: Windows, Linux, and macOS. There are UI-based bitcoin miners, as well as command-line-based bitcoin miners—for example, Pyminer, which is an implementation in Python.   Increasing difficulty in mining bitcoin  Because of the increasing competition and difficulties, there are many factors that must be borne in mind when mining bitcoin, as shown in the following list:  Bitcoins are getting more expensive day by day because of competition Many supercomputers across the globe are in competition to mine the next block and bitcoin As the number of bitcoin miners has increased, it has become more problematic and overpriced to start mining new bitcoin  For example, the following screenshot shows a chart of how the difficulty of bitcoin mining has been increasing; for more information refer to https:  bitcoinwisdom.com bitcoin difficulty. This particular chart shows values from the last two months. This recent trend reflects the increasing difficulty that began when bitcoin was first created:   Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to get started programming bitcoin with Python. We explored Blockchain.info API programming with Python to get statistics and other bitcoin market data.  We also learned how to get started with mining bitcoin. We looked at the various ways to mine bitcoin, and we learned about why bitcoin mining may not be for everybody because of its increasing competition and difficulty.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to start running bitcoin programmatically by way of accepting bitcoin on your website, running API-based microservices, or by building a bitcoin trading bot.   Earning Bitcoin Programmatically  In this chapter, we will learn how to start accepting bitcoin as a payment method on our websites. We'll also learn how to build API-based microservices to earn bitcoin, and explore bitcoin trading bots.   Accepting bitcoin on your website  In this section, we will learn about the following topics:  How to enable bitcoin payment on our websites Introduction to BitPay, a third-party bitcoin API service How to generate a bitcoin payment button How to add a bitcoin payment button to our website  There are a lot of third-party APIs that are available on the web that enable developers to start accepting bitcoin for products or services on their website quickly. One of the most popular ones is BitPay.   Introduction to BitPay  BitPay can be used to accept payment in a lot of different ways, including the following:  You can use bitcoin to accept online payments on e-commerce websites Integrate bitcoin with a lot of different e-commerce solutions Integrating with shopping carts You can display bitcoin-enabled payment buttons, which work well for accepting donations on blogs or podcasts   How to generate a bitcoin payment button  Go through the following steps to generate a bitcoin payment button:  1.  First, sign up and log in to BitPay at https:  bitpay.com . 2.  Next, go to the Payment Tools  Payment Buttons page and create a payment button:  3.  New fields require a SERVER IPN for a secure server POST, and the amount gets paid when the  user clicks on it. You will see the preview of the button at the bottom of the page:   4.  To add this button to the website, just copy the HTML code and paste it in the required web  page.   How to add a bitcoin payment button to your website  Go through the following steps to add the payment button to your website page:  1.  Open the source code of your website page in the code editor. 2.  Paste the HTML code that we copied from the BitPay website in the previous section, save the  3.  The following screenshot shows the web page with a payment button that users can use to send  file, and reload the web page.  payments:   Building and releasing bitcoin-enabled APIs  In this section, we will learn about the following topics:  Introducing the 21.co marketplace Getting started with the 21.co SDK Starting to sell services for bitcoin   21.co marketplace  21.co is a platform that hosts a virtual marketplace where developers can create and sell microservices in return  for bitcoin. For more information please refer to https:  earn.com .  We will demonstrate how to join this marketplace and sell microservices to earn bitcoin.  To do this, we will use 21.co's SDK.   21.co SDK  The 21.co SDK is currently supported on Ubuntu and macOS. A demonstration of Ubuntu running on AWS will be seen in this section.  You can create an AWS Ubuntu 14.x instance on AWS by following the instructions from https:  aws.a mazon.com premiumsupport knowledge-center create-linux-instance .  After creating the AWS instance, connect to it by following the instructions from the AWS documentation page at https:  docs.aws.amazon.com AWSEC2 latest UserGuide AccessingInstances.html.  Once connected to the AWS instance, install the 21.co SDK. You can do this by executing the following command:  Once the SDK is installed, log in to your 21.co account by executing the following command:  If a user does not have a 21.co login, they must create an account on the 21.co website. After logging in, first join the 21.co node to the 21.co virtual marketplace. You can do this by executing the following command:  The status of the user's join request can be achieved by executing the following command:  Next, test the installation by executing the following command:  The preceding command will show that all the tests have been passed and the node is set up and joined to the 21.co marketplace.  In order to get the bitcoin balance, execute the following command:  21 status   The preceding code shows you the bitcoin balance that is being held in the 21.co account.  curl https:   21.co  sh   21 login  21 market join  21 market status  21 doctor   Selling microservices on the 21.co marketplace  21.co's SDK comes bundled with some services. To start all of them, execute the following command:  21 sell start --all  There might be a prompt to install a dependency. If so, you should go ahead and do it.  Sometimes, the user might need to log out and log in again to set the changes up.  For selling microservices on the 21.co marketplace, perform the following steps:  1.  Execute the following command:  21 sell start --all  It will show you the listing of all the microservices that are available to start selling in the virtual marketplace.  2.  To look at the status of your services, execute the following command:  3.  Once you are done with the services, or if you want to stop it, run the following command:  4.  To look at all the activity that happened on the node, use the following command:  21 sell status  21 sell stop -all  21 log  This was a demonstration of how to earn bitcoin by selling and listing microservices on the 21.co marketplace.   Building a bitcoin trading bot  In this section, we will learn about the following topics:  How to get the current bid and asking price for bitcoin How to make a decision whether to buy or sell bitcoin Triggering the bitcoin trade advice alert  Actual buying and selling of bitcoin won't be covered, as it involves actual money. However, we will focus on sending an email alert when it is trying to buy or sell bitcoin based on the condition we set.  We will use the bitcoin price API module to fetch the bitcoin price. It is available on GitHub at https:   github.com dursk bitcoin-price-api.   Triggering the bitcoin trade advice alert  In order to setup the bitcoin trade advice alert, go through the following steps:  1.  First, start by importing the bitcoin price API, called exchanges:  ! usr bin python   import modules  Make sure to copy the exchanges from https:  github.com dursk bitcoin-price-api  to the same location as this script from exchanges.bitfinex import Bitfinex  2.  Also import smtplib, which we will use for triggering the bitcoin price alert. Here, we define a  function called trigger_email. We then set the server user and email details:  import smtplib   Function to send email def trigger_email msg :   Change these to your email details  email_user = "bitcoin.harish@gmail.com"  email_password = "bitcoin1"  smtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'  smtp_port = 587  email_from = "bitcoin.harish@gmail.com"  email_to = "bitcoin.harish@gmail.com"   login to the email server  server = smtplib.SMTP smtp_server, smtp_port   server.starttls    server.login email_user, email_password     send email  server.sendmail email_from, email_to, msg   server.quit    3.  Using smtplib, send the sendmail function to send the price alert email, as shown in the following  code:  4.  Next, define the buy and sell price thresholds for bitcoin. Use these thresholds to make decisions  on whether to sell or buy bitcoin:   define buy and sell thresholds for Bitcoin. These values you have to change according to the current price of the bitcoin. buy_thresh = 6500 sell_thresh = 6500  5.  Next, we get the current bitcoin price and the current asking price for bitcoin from Bitfinex  bitcoin exchange using the exchanges module that we imported in the bitcoin_trade.py script. We can also use some other exchanges, such as CoinDesk, but for the moment, we will use Bitfinex. We will get these prices in btc_sell_price and btc_buy_price.   get Bitcoin prices btc_sell_price = Bitfinex  .get_current_bid   btc_buy_price = Bitfinex  .get_current_ask     6.  Once we have the current prices, we can compare them with the threshold prices we have set  7.  If the buy price is lower than the sell threshold, we call the trigger_email function to send a buy  before.  trigger email alarm:  8.  If the sell price is greater than the sell threshold, we call the trigger_email function to send the  sell trigger email alert:   Trigger Buy email if buy price is lower than threshold if btc_buy_price < buy_thresh: email_msg = """  Bitcoin Buy Price is %s which is lower than  threshold price of %s.  Good time to buy!""" %  btc_buy_price, buy_thresh   trigger_email email_msg    Trigger sell email if sell price is higher than threshold if btc_sell_price > sell_thresh:    email_msg = """  Bitcoin sell Price is %s which is higher than  threshold price of %s.  Good time to sell!""" %  btc_sell_price, sell_thresh   trigger_email email_msg    How to get a current bid and asking price for bitcoin  Google search is the simplest way to search for the current bid rate. In  order to achieve the buying and selling of bitcoin, the triggering of both should be done accordingly.   The triggering of buy bitcoin  The following are the steps to go through to get the current bid:  1.  First, check the bitcoin price online. 2.  Modify the script so that the buy alert triggers first. Set the buy threshold to higher than the  current price. Here, we set the buy threshold to 6500, as shown in the following code:   define buy and sell thresholds for Bitcoin buy_thresh = 6500 sell_thresh = 6500  3.  Save the script and execute it. The following screenshot shows the executed script:  The script has been executed and the buy alert should have gone. Check it in the email.  The following screenshot shows that we have received the bitcoin alert email advising us to buy bitcoin, according to the criteria that we have set up in the script:   The triggering of sell bitcoin  1.  Initially, we should set the sell threshold as lower than the current price. So, for example, let's set the threshold for 6400 and execute the script again. The following code shows that the sell_thresh is set to 6400:   define buy and sell thresholds for bitcoin buy_thresh = 6400 sell_thresh = 6400  Now, the sell alert should execute. Verify it in the email again.  2.  After verifying this, we should see that we have received the email alert advising us to sell  bitcoin because the current asking price is higher than what we are willing to sell for:  3.  The script is ready. You can now set it to run automatically on all kinds of operating systems. On  4.  From the Action menu, choose Create Task..., and give it the name Bitcoin trade alert, as shown  Windows, use the Task Scheduler.  in the following screenshot:   5.  From the Triggers tab, click on New..., as shown in the following screenshot:   6.  Choose the Daily radio button.  7.  Then, in Advanced settings, choose to repeat the task after the required number of minutes or  hours. Here, we will set it to every 1 hour, as shown in the following screenshot:   8.  Next, from the Actions tab, click on the New... button.  9.  Choose the script that was created to be executed whenever the task runs by clicking on the  Browse... button. Now, this task will run automatically every hour, and will check for bitcoin prices and send an email advising us whether to buy or sell bitcoin.   You can also choose to trigger the trade right from the script itself, using any of the bitcoin exchange APIs, such as coinbase.com. As it involves actual money, the user needs to be careful with it.   Summary  In this chapter, we explored how to enable bitcoin payments on a website, introduced you to BitPay, learned about how to generate a bitcoin payment button, and how to add the payment button to our websites. We also introduced the 21.co marketplace and buying selling services for bitcoin, as well as writing a bare bones bitcoin trading bot. We learned how to get the current bidding and asking prices for bitcoin. We also learned how to decide as to whether to buy or sell bitcoins, as well as how to send out an email alert advising us whether to execute that thread.  In the next chapter, we will learn about performing data analysis on bitcoin data.   Bitcoin Data Analysis  In this chapter, we will explore the manipulation and visualization of bitcoin price data using Python. We will also explore bitcoin transaction graphs, along with collecting and analyzing Bitcoin Dice game data using Python.   Manipulating and visualizing bitcoin price data  In this section, we will introduce the following topics:  Getting set up for data analysis Getting, reading in, and cleaning bitcoin price data Exploring, manipulating, and visualizing the cleaned-up data  We first need to install several Python libraries, which includes installing the pandas module for reading in data, and also doing some exploratory analysis. We'll also be installing matplotlib for creating plots and charts, as well as Jupyter Notebooks, as they are the best for this kind of work involving data analysis.   Getting set up for data analysis  To install the Python modules, open the command-line program. In the command line, to install pandas, execute the following command:  Similarly, to install matplotlib, execute the following command:  To install Jupyter, execute the following command:  pip install pandas  pip install matplotlib  pip install jupyter  Having finished installing the required modules, launch the Jupyter Notebook by executing the jupyter notebook command. This will open up a new browser window, or a tab, where it will display the list of files that are already there from the folder where we executed the jupyter notebook command. The following screenshot shows the jupyter notebook command:  Next, choose to create a new Python 3 notebook, as shown in the following screenshot:    Getting, reading in, and cleaning bitcoin price data  We will start by importing the necessary modules.  Import pandas to enable you to read in the data and start exploring it. The following screenshot shows the import pandas command:  Also, import matplotlib for drawing plots from the data.  We need to set some options for pandas and matplotlib. The following screenshot shows the command for importing matplotlib:  The first option we will set is called options.mode.chained_assignment = None.  The preceding option is to make sure that the operations are for the cleanup, which will be performed on the pandas DataFrame objects; we want the cleanup to happen on the original DataFrame objects and not on copies.  The following screenshot shows the options.mode.chained_assignment = None option:   Also, set matplotlib to visualize and display all the charts shown in the following screenshot:  The price data we have is from coindesk.com, as shown in the following screenshot, and it is freely available for download:   Download the data in CSV format and read this data using pandas. This is a CSV file, so we will use the read_CSV method from pandas, as shown in the following screenshot:   DataFrame  The data in a pandas data object is called a DataFrame. A DataFrame is in a tabular data format. Now, print out some records to see how this looks. To print this out, we can call a method called head   on the price DataFrame.  When we do this, we get two columns—Date and Close Price—for the bitcoin in USD for that day. We also have a default index for the rows starting from 0, which was inserted by pandas by default while reading in the data. The following screenshot shows the two columns, Date and Close Price:  To get top-level information about this data, call the info   method on it. After calling this method, we get 2,592 records. There are two columns: Date and Close Price. Date has 2,592 non-null records of the type object, which means that the Date field has been read as text. We would have to change it to a proper date-time format later. We have the close price as a numeric float type. It has 2,590 non-null records, which are two records fewer than the Date field.   The following screenshot shows the details of the info   method:  In order to print for the records from bottom, call the tail   method. This method shows that the last two records should not exist, as they are not a date or price. We need to remove these before proceeding with further analysis.  We can see that the close price has NaN values, which means that it has missing values. We can use this factor to remove these two records from the DataFrame. We call drop any method on the price, which will remove the records that have one or more of the columns as null or missing values.   Bear in mind that we are just removing it from the DataFrame price and not from the CSV file from which we read the data.  The code in the following screenshot shows the tail   method implementation:  Also, look at the bottom rows again to see if the records we wanted to remove have been removed. We can see in the following screenshot that they have, in fact, been removed:   Data cleanup  Another data cleaning task we need to do is convert the Date column from an object or text format to a date-time format. We use the pandas to_datetime method to do this.  Here, we ask the to_datetime method to convert the Date field or price DataFrame, and we also supply the format. We then assign the Date field back to the DataFrame, as shown in the following screenshot:  This is the reason that we set the chained assignment as equal to null earlier, because we wanted to make the changes back on the original DataFrame.  Call the info   method again to see whether the data cleanup has an impact. We can see that the Date field is now in a date-time format, as we wanted, and there are no non-null records in the data, as shown in the following screenshot:   Setting the index to the Date column  We also need to set the index to the Date column and remove the Date column as a separate column. This will help us to run some interesting queries on the date data.  The code in the following screenshot shows how to set the index to the Date column:  Next, delete the Date column as a separate column, since it is already set up as an index, as shown in the following screenshot:   Now, the Date column can be seen as an index and not a separate column anymore, as shown in the following screenshot:   Exploring, manipulating, and visualizing the cleaned-up data  As the data cleanup is done, start with the data exploration tasks. We can use the pandas date-time capabilities to run some interesting queries.  For example, if we want to get all the records from a particular year, pass that year to the DataFrame inside square brackets. The following screenshot shows the price data from the year 2010:   We can also specify whether we want the data from a particular date.  The following screenshot shows the bitcoin price in USD from August 1, 2017:   We can also specify whether we want the data from a particular period spanning certain dates.  The following screenshot shows the data from August 1, 2017, onward:  Statistical information can also be retrieved using pandas methods. For example, to get the minimum   price from this dataset, we can use the min   method, as shown in the following screenshot:  To get the maximum price, use the max    method, as shown in the following screenshot:  A whole bunch of statistical information can be received in one go using the describe    method, as shown in the following screenshot:   Data visualization  It is very easy to start creating plots from data using pandas and matplotlib. To plot the entirety of the data, we will call the plot method on the price DataFrame, and we will get a plot where the x axis is the date and the y axis is the price data.  The following screenshot describes the plot, wherein the x axis is the date and the y axis is the price data:  We can also zoom in on a certain time period. For example, in order to plot the data from 2017 only, first select the data that is from 2017 and then call the plot    method on the subset of data.  In the following screenshot, we have a plot for the price data from 2017 onward:   In the next section, we will look at how to use bitcoin transaction graphs.   Exploring bitcoin transaction graphs  In this section, we will learn about how to get the blockchain data, and provide step-by-step information as to how to explore, clean up, analyze, and visualize this data.   Bitcoin and blockchain graphs  Blockchain.info is one of the best places to look at the latest bitcoin stats and graphs. There are different kinds of charts and graphs concerning bitcoin and blockchain that are available for analysis. We can also download the data in a variety of formats—CSV, JSON, and so on. We have downloaded some of this data in CSV format in the previous section, and now we will explore this data in a Jupyter Notebook.  We start by importing the modules we need. We need pandas for data reading, exploration, and cleanup, and we need matplotlib for creating the graphs.  Look at the data showing the total number of bitcoins in circulation. Read the CSV file that has this data and create a pandas DataFrame.  The following screenshot shows the data for the total number of bitcoins in circulation:    Exploring, cleaning up, and analyzing data  In order to explore this data, we use the head   method to look at the records from the top and we call the info   method on the DataFrame to get some more information, such as how many records there are, how many null or missing records there are, or what the data types of the various columns are.  We can see that the Date column is shown as object. We change this to date-time to visualize this data. To do this, we use the to_datetime method, and assign the converted values back to the same column— the DataFrame.  The following screenshot depicts the date format of bitcoins:   Set the index of the DataFrame to the Date column and delete the Date column as a separate column. Perform this step in order to take advantage of the time series features of pandas.  Now, check again whether the changes took place by calling info and head on the DataFrame.  The following screenshot shows the bitcoins for a particular range of dates:   We are now ready to create a graph from this data. Call the plot    method on the DataFrame and then call the show    method to display the graph.  It shows the total number of bitcoins that have already been mined over the time period for which we have this record.  The following screenshot describes the graph for the preceding data:    Visualizing data  Let's look at another example. Here, we are looking at transactions for block data that we read into the data:  Initially, we visually explore this data using the head and info methods, as shown in the following screenshot:  Next, we clean up, convert, and reshape the data, as shown in the following screenshot:   Finally, we visualize our transactions in the block data, as shown in the following screenshot:  Similarly, there is another example that we should look at regarding the data showing mining difficulty. The steps for mining data are as follows:  1.  Read in the data, as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  Explore the data, as shown in the following screenshot:   3.  Clean up the data, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Finally, visualize the data, as shown in the following screenshot:   We can see that there has been a gradual increase in mining difficulty over the years, and it trends upwards. These are just a few examples of transaction graphs. There is a lot of other data available for you to explore from the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem.  In the next module, we will look at how to collect and analyze Bitcoin Dice game data.   Collecting and analyzing Bitcoin Dice game data  In this section, we will look at the data from a dice games portal, read in the data from the API, and use pandas to convert it into a tabular format. We will also export the data and find the things that need cleaning up. We'll clean up, manipulate, and reshape the data, making it ready for analysis, and finally, we will draw a simple plot from the clean data.   Getting data from the Games Web API  The user can explore the dice games data from MegaDice.com, which is available from the website's API link at https:  www.megadice.com.  We will use the pandas read_JSON method to read individual winner history data from the MegaDice API link. We create a pandas DataFrame, called leaders, from this data and call in the head    method to see what this data looks like.  The code in the following screenshots shows the creation of the pandas DataFrame, leaders:  The data we have imported has 703 columns, most of which are individual dates. We will delete the last column, queryTimeInSeconds, which is not really part of the actual data, and should not be there. This column is shown in the following screenshot:   As there are too many columns and very few rows, we want the columns to be rows, where each state has a single row of records. In order to perform this, we need to flip the columns to rows and vice versa. To do this, we need to go through the following steps:  1.  First, we reset the index so that we bring in the current index as another column. The values for this column will become column names when we flip the DataFrame. Confirm it with the head    method, as shown in the following screenshot:   2.  Next, flip the DataFrame by using a method called T, or transposed, which can be seen in the  following screenshot:  3.  Now, in the following screenshot, we can see that our row index has become dates and our  earlier rows have become columns:  We've got the columns and rows we want, but there are also a few other things that need to be done. We want the date values to be in a date-time format, but currently it is in text format. However, the transposing of the DataFrame has changed the date values into an index. We need to first convert them into a column using the reset_index method, as shown in the following screenshot:  Now we can convert this text data into a proper date-time format, as shown in the following screenshot:   Call the info    method to confirm this. We have the new column Date in the proper date-time format. Date values are required to be in text format in the column name index, as shown in the following screenshot:  We will set the index back to the proper Date column and remove the Date column as a separate column, as shown in the following screenshot:  Now, we have the DataFrame properly indexed on the Date field:   Draw a sample plot of this data using the plot    method and show it with the plt.show    method, as shown in the following screenshot:   Now this data can be used as pandas time series functions, or multiple blocks that can be visualized for different subsets of dates, and so on.   Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to prepare our setup for data analysis. We saw how to get, read in, and clean the price data. We also learned how to explore, manipulate, and visualize the cleaned-up data.  We also explored some of the bitcoin and blockchain graphs that we can create. We learned where to get the relevant data, and we read this data in a Jupyter Notebook and imported the necessary modules. We cleaned up and manipulated this data, and finally, we created graphs out of this data and a notebook, but without using Python.  We also explored the data from a dice games portal. We added the data from the API and used pandas to convert it into a tabular format. We explored the data and found the things that needed cleaning up. We cleaned up and manipulated the data and made it ready for analysis.
