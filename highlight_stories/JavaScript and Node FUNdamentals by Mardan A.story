Think about line numbers in BASIC or interfaces, classes and patterns in Java. On the other hand JavaScript inherits the best traits of pure mathematics, LISP, C which lead to a great deal of expressiveness¹  and fun! . More about Expressive Power in this post: What does “expressive” mean when referring to programming languages?² The quintessential Hello World example in Java  remember, Java is to JavaScript is what ham to a hamster :  public class HelloWorld {  public static void main String[] args  {  System.out.println "Hello World" ;  1 2 3 4 5  }  }  The same example in JavaScript:  1  console.log 'Hello World'   or from within an HTML page:  ¹http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Expressive_power ²http:  stackoverflow.com questions 638881 what-does-expressive-mean-when-referring-to-programming-languages   JavaScript FUNdamentals: The Powerful and Misunderstood Language of The Web  3  JavaScript allows programmers to focus on the solution problem rather that to jump through hoops and API docs.  Automatic type casting works well most of the times. It a great feature that saves a lot of time and mental energy! There’re only a few primitives types:  1 2 3    document.write 'Hello World'     1.2 Loose Typing  1. String 2. Number  both integer and real  3. Boolean 4. Undefined 5. Null  Everything else is an object, i.e., mutable keyed collections. Read Stackoverflow on What does immutable mean?³ Also, in JavaScript there are String, Number and Boolean objects which contain helpers for the primitives:  1  'a' === new String 'a'    false  1  'a' === new String 'a' .toString     true  but  or  1  'a' == new String 'a'    true  By the way, == performs automatic type casting while === not.  1.3 Object Literal Notation  Object notation is super readable and compact:  ³http:  stackoverflow.com questions 3200211 what-does-immutable-mean   JavaScript FUNdamentals: The Powerful and Misunderstood Language of The Web  4  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4  Remember that functions are objects?  var obj = {  color: "green", type: "suv", owner: {  ...  }  }  var obj = function    { this.color: "green", this.type: "suv", this.owner: {  ...  }  }  1.4 Functions  1.4.1 Create a Function  var f = function f    {  console.log 'Hi' ; return true;  }  or  }  function f    {  console.log 'Hi' ; return true;  Functions are first-class citizens, and we treat them as variables, because they are objects! Yes, functions can even have properties attributes.  Function with a property  remember functions are just object that can be invoked, i.e. initialized :   JavaScript FUNdamentals: The Powerful and Misunderstood Language of The Web  5  Note: the return keyword is optional. In case its omitted the function will return undefined upon invocation.  1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  }  }  var f = function    {console.log 'Boo' ;} f.boo = 1; f  ;   outputs Boo console.log f.boo ;   outputs 1  1.4.2 Pass Functions as Params  var convertNum = function  num  { return num + 10;  var processNum = function  num, fn  {  return fn num ;  processNum 10, convertNum ;  1.4.3 Invocation vs. Expression  Function definition:  1  function f    {};  Invocation:  1  f  ;  1 2  function f   {return false;} f  ;  Statement:  Expression  because it resolve to some value which could be a number, a string, an object or a boolean :   JavaScript FUNdamentals: The Powerful and Misunderstood Language of The Web  6  1  function f a  {console.log a ;}  1.5 Arrays  Arrays are also objects which have some special methods inherited from Array.prototype⁴ global object. Nevertheless, JavaScript Arrays are not real arrays. Instead, they are objects with unique integer  usually 0-based  keys.  1 2 3 4  var arr = []; var arr2 = [1, "Hi", {a:2}, function    {console.log 'boo' ;}]; var arr3 = new Array  ; var arr4 = new Array 1,"Hi", {a:2}, function    {console.log 'boo' ;} ;  1.6 Prototypal Nature  There are no classes in JavaScript because objects inherit directly from other objects which is called prototypal inheritance: There are a few types of inheritance patterns in JS:    Classical   Pseudo-classical   Functional  Example of the functional inheritance pattern:  var user = function  ops  {  return { firstName: ops.name  'John'  var agency = function ops  {  ops = ops  {} var agency = user ops  agency.customers = ops.customers  0 agency.isAgency = true return agency  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  }  }  , lastName: ops.name  'Doe' , email: ops.email  'test@test.com' , name: function   { return this.firstName + this.lastName} }  ⁴https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web JavaScript Reference Global_Objects Array prototypeProperties   JavaScript FUNdamentals: The Powerful and Misunderstood Language of The Web  7  Most of these conventions  with semi-colons being an exception  are stylistic, and highly preferential and don’t impact the execution.  1.7 Conventions  1.7.1 Semi-Colons  Optional semi-colons, except for two cases:  1. In for loop construction: for  var i=0; i++; i<n  2. When a new line starts with parentheses, e.g., Immediately-Invoked Function Expression   IIFE : ; function  {...}     1.7.2 camelCase  cameCase, except for class names which are CapitalCamelCase, e.g.,  1 2  var MainView = Backbone.View.extend {...}  var mainView = new MainView    1.7.3 Naming  _,$ are perfectly legitimate characters for the literals  jQuery and Underscore libraries use them a lot . Private methods and attributes start with _  does nothing by itself! .  1.7.4 Commas  Comma-first approach  1 2 3 4  var obj = { firstName: "John" , lastName: "Smith" , email: "johnsmith@gmail.com" }  1.7.5 Indentation  Usually it’s either tab, 4 or 2 space indentation with their supporters’ camps being almost religiously split between the options.   JavaScript FUNdamentals: The Powerful and Misunderstood Language of The Web  8  Usually, there is a space before and after =, +, { and } symbols. There is no space on invocation, e.g., arr.push 1 ;, but there’s a space when we define an anonymous function: function    {}.  At least until ES6⁵, everything is in the global scope, a.k.a. window and included via   tags. However, there are external libraries that allow for workarounds:  Node.js uses CommonJS-like syntax and has build-in support for modules. To hide your code from global scope, make private attributes methods use closures and immediately- invoked function expressions⁸  or IIFEs .  1.9 Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions  IIFEs   1.7.6 White spaces  1.8 No Modules    CommonJS⁶   AMD and Require.js⁷  1 2 3 4 5   function    { window.yourModule = { ... }; }   ;  This snippet show an example of a object with private attribute and method:  ⁵https:  wiki.mozilla.org ES6_plans ⁶http:  www.commonjs.org  ⁷http:  requirejs.org  ⁸http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Immediately-invoked_function_expression   JavaScript FUNdamentals: The Powerful and Misunderstood Language of The Web  9   function    {  window.boo = function   {  var _a = 1; var inc = function    {  _a++; console.log _a ; return _a;  }; return {  increment: inc  };  }  }   ; var b = window.boo  ; b.increment  ;  Now try this:  1 2 3  b.increment  ; b.increment  ; b.increment  ;  1.10 Keyword “this”  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  1 2 3 4 5 6  When in doubt: console.log!  1.11 Pitfalls  Mutates changes a lot  especially in jQuery ! Rule of thumb is to re-assign to a locally scoped variable before attempting to use this inside of a closure:  var app = this $ 'a' .click function e {  console.log this    most likely the event or the console.log app    that's what we want! app.processData e  }   target anchor element  JS is the only language that programmers think they shouldn’t learn. Things like === vs. ==, global scope leakage, DOM, etc. might lead to problems down the road. This is why it’s important to understand the language or use something like CoffeeScript, that take a way most of the issues.   JavaScript FUNdamentals: The Powerful and Misunderstood Language of The Web  10  1.12 Further Learning  If you liked this articled and would like to explore JavaScript more, take a look at this amazing free resource: Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming⁹. Of course for more advanced JavaScript enthusiasts and pros, there’s my book Rapid Prototyping with JS¹⁰ and intensive programming school HackReactor¹¹, where I teach part-time.  ⁹http:  eloquentjavascript.net  ¹⁰http:  rpjs.co ¹¹http:  hackreactor.com   2 CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The  Better JavaScript  The CoffeeScript is a language that was built on top of JavaScript. CoffeeScript has some added benefits and its code is compiled into native JavaScript for execution. The CoffeeScript pros include: better syntax, function and class construction patterns, automatic var insertion, comprehensions and others. Most of these perks will be obvious once we take a look at some examples. This quick language reference can get you started with CoffeeScript:    Semicolons, Whitespace and Parentheses   Vars   Conditions   Functions   Classes   Arrays   Splats   Comprehensions  2.1 Semicolons, Whitespace and Parentheses  While in JavaScript, semicolons are redundant and optional; in CoffeeScript they are banned. The whitespace and indentation  typically two-space  are parts of the CoffeeScript language. Parentheses for function invocation are optional  except when there are no arguments . The same goes for curly braces for object literals. We can even next objects without curly braces:   CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  12  console.log a.x+a.y  Translates into this JavaScript:  var a, b;  a = {  x: 1, y: -20, z: function   {  return console.log a.x + a.y ;  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  a =  x: 1 y: -20 z:    ->  a.z    b = [ 1, 2,  ]  x: 10 y: 20  } };  a.z  ;  b = [  1, 2, { x: 10, y: 20  } ];  As you might have noticed, the logical block’s curly braces that we use to write code for functions  i.e., {}  are also replaced by indentation. Let’s not forget that functions are just objects in JavaScript. :-    CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  13  CoffeeScript automatically inserts var keywords for us and prohibits manual usage of var. For example, a,b, and c variable declarations will have the var in the JavaScript code:  CoffeeScript always puts vars at the top of the scope where this particular variable was encountered first. The scope is defined by the function or window. For example, the anonymous function d will have e scoped to it, because CoffeeScript first saw e inside of the function:  2.2 Vars  a = 10 b = 'x' c = [1,2,3]  JavaScript code:  var a, b, c;  a = 10;  b = 'x';  c = [1, 2, 3];  a = 10 b = 'x' c = [1,2,3]  d =    ->  e = a console.log e  d    JavaScript output:  1 2 3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  14  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  var a, b, c, d;  a = 10;  b = 'x';  c = [1, 2, 3];  d = function   {  var e; e = a; return console.log e ;  };  d  ;  2.3 Conditions  a = b = c = d = 1 if a is b or b isnt c and not c is d  console.log 'true'  else  console.log 'false'  var a, b, c, d;  a = b = c = d = 1;  if  a === b  b !== c && !c === d  {  console.log 'true' ;  } else {  }  console.log 'false' ;  Conditions are more readable by humans  English-like?  in CoffeeScript:  So is is ===, isnt is !==, not is !, and is &&, and or is . In CoffeeScript some fancy and arguably more readable constructions are possible:   CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  15  Functions in CoffeeScript are defined with arrows   -> and and fat arrows   =>  more on this later :  1 2 3 4  1 2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  1 2 3 4  console.log a if a is not null if a isnt null then console.log a if not a is null then console.log a unless a is null then console.log a  Note: unless is just a shortcut for if not.  2.4 Functions  a =  x,y  -> console.log x+y a 10,-5   JavaScript code:  var a;  };  a 10, -5 ;  a = function x, y  {  return console.log x + y ;  a =  x, y, z=15  -> sum = x + y + z console.log sum a 10,-5   Longer expressions can be on multiple lines using indentation, while the default values can be assigned right in the function signature  i.e.,  name=value  :   CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  16  So back to the far arrow, it does two things: 1. Defines a function 2. Binds the new function’s scope to the current value of this Remember that this is dynamically scoped, i.e., its meaning changes based on where it is situated in the code  what’s the scope . For example, if we have a jQuery event handler click, we might want to use this as the object in which we defined the handler, not as the DOM element to which the handler is bound. For example, this CoffeeScript code will return window object both times  that’s what we want :  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  1 2 3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  var a;  a = function x, y, z  {  var sum; if  z == null  {  z = 15;  } sum = x + y + z; return console.log sum ;  };  a 10, -5 ;  console.log @ $ 'div' .click   =>  console.log @  The JavaScript code:  console.log this ;  $ 'div' .click  function _this  {  return function   {  return console.log _this ;  };  }  this  ;  However, with single arrows it’s back to the DOM scope for the event handler,  this might be bad if unexpected :   CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  17  1 2 3  1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5  console.log @ $ 'div' .click   ->  console.log @  console.log this ;  $ 'div' .click function   { return console.log this ;  } ;  console.log this ; var that = this; $ 'div' .click function   { return console.log that ;  } ;  2.5 Classes  Traditionally for the snippet above, without the CoffeeScript’s far arrows, you would see workarounds like these which use interim variables like that, self, or _this:  Classes are probably the most yummiest and the most complex and confusing feature in CoffeeScript. In JavaScript classes are absent at all! We use prototypes instead, so the objects inherit from other objects. We can also use factories, i.e., the functions that create objects. However, if a developer wants to implement a class, it could be really tricky and often requires a good understanding of pseudo-classical instantiation patterns. This is not the case with CoffeeScript, which introduces class keyword. Inside of the class we can use constructor method and super call, for the initialization logic and the invocation of the parent’s methods correspondingly. For example, we have a parent class Vehicle from which we extend two classes Compact and Suv. In these classes, we write custom move methods with the super call, that allows us to re-use the logic from the parent class Vehicle.

Camry moved 5 miles. Speeding... Cadillac moved 45 miles.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  The JavaScript output is quite lengthy, so no wonder developers often prefer functional or other patterns:  var Compact, Suv, Vehicle, caddi, camry,  __hasProp = {}.hasOwnProperty, __extends = function child, parent  { for  var key in parent  { if  __hasProp.c\ all parent, key   child[key] = parent[key]; } function ctor   { this.constructor \ = child; } ctor.prototype = parent.prototype; child.prototype = new ctor  ; child\ .__super__ = parent.prototype; return child; };  Vehicle =  function   {  function Vehicle name  {  this.name = name;   CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  19  }  };  }  };  }  };  11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52  Vehicle.prototype.move = function meters  {  return console.log this.name +  " moved " + meters + " miles."  ;  return Vehicle;  }   ;  Compact =  function _super  { __extends Compact, _super ;  function Compact   {  return Compact.__super__.constructor.apply this, arguments ;  Compact.prototype.move = function   {  console.log "Cruising..." ; return Compact.__super__.move.call this, 5 ;  return Compact;  }  Vehicle ;  Suv =  function _super  { __extends Suv, _super ;  function Suv   {  return Suv;  }  Vehicle ;  return Suv.__super__.constructor.apply this, arguments ;  Suv.prototype.move = function   {  console.log "Speeding..." ; return Suv.__super__.move.call this, 45 ;   CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  20  Arrays in CoffeeScript can be defined just as they are in native JavaScript: arr = [1, 2, 3]. But we can do so much more with arrays in CoffeeScript! For example, we can use a range when defining an array  useful in iterators and comprehensions  and use slice:  53 54 55 56 57 58 59  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  camry = new Compact "Camry" ;  caddi = new Suv "Cadillac" ;  camry.move  ;  caddi.move  ;  2.6 Arrays and Slicing  1 2 3  arr = [1..10] slicedArr = arr[2..4] console.log arr, slicedArr  The console outputs:  1  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] [3, 4, 5]  var arr, slicedArr;  arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];  slicedArr = arr.slice 2, 5 ;  console.log arr, slicedArr ;  Trivia fact: for array declarations with 20+ items  e.g., range of [0..20] and larger , CoffeeScript compiler will switch to the for loop.  2.7 Splats  Splats is a better way of using a variable number of arguments and arguments object  from native JavaScript :   CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  21  1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  1 2 3 4 5 6  a =  x...  -> sum = 0 x.forEach  item  -> sum += item console.log sum a 10,-5, 15   var a,  __slice = [].slice;  a = function   {  return sum += item;  } ; return console.log sum ;  };  a 10, -5, 15 ;  a =  x...  -> sum = 0 x.forEach  item  -> sum += item console.log sum  a [-5..50]...  The output is 1260. And the JavaScript:  var sum, x; x = 1 <= arguments.length ? __slice.call arguments, 0  : []; sum = 0; x.forEach function item  {  Spats work with invocations too. For example, our sum function from the previous example needs to treat the array not as a first element, but as all arguments:   CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  22  var sum, x; x = 1 <= arguments.length ? __slice.call arguments, 0  : []; sum = 0; x.forEach function item  {  var a, _i, _results, __slice = [].slice;  a = function   {  return sum += item;  } ; return console.log sum ;  };  a.apply null,  function   {  _results = []; for  _i = -5; _i <= 50; _i++ { _results.push _i ; } return _results;  } .apply this  ;  2.8 Comprehensions  The last but not least topic is comprehensions. They are probably the most used feature in CoffeeScript and replace  or at least try to replace  all loops. For example, a simple iteration over an array:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3  arr = [ 'x', 'y', 'z'  ]  x y z  for a in arr  console.log a  The console output is:  The compiled code:   }  x 0 y 1 z 2  x 0 z 2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3  1 2  1 2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  23  var a, arr, _i, _len;  arr = ['x', 'y', 'z'];  a = arr[_i]; console.log a ;  for  _i = 0, _len = arr.length; _i < _len; _i++  {  As is the case with conditions, comprehensions might be reversed in order, e.g., console.log a for a in arr. Then, we can get an index which will be the second parameter, e.g., console.log a, i for a, i in arr outputs:  The when clause acts like a filter method; in other words, we can apply a test to the iterator:  arr = ['x', 'y', 'z'] console.log a, i for a, i in arr when a isnt 'y'  The console outputs:  To step with an increment we can use by: evens =  x for x in [0..10] by 2 . In addition, for iterating over objects we can use of:  obj =  'x': 10 'y':-2 'z': 50  coordinates = for key, value of obj "coordinate {key} is {value}pt"  console.log coordinates  The console output is:   CoffeeScript FUNdamentals: The Better JavaScript  24  1  ["coordinate x is 10pt", "coordinate y is -2pt", "coordinate z is 50pt"]  The JavaScript code is:  var coordinates, key, obj, value;  obj = {  'x': 10, 'y': -2, 'z': 50  };  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  coordinates =  function   {  var _results; _results = []; for  key in obj  { value = obj[key]; _results.push "coordinate " + key + " is " + value + "pt" ;  } return _results;  }   ;  2.9 Conclusion  This CoffeeScript FUNdamentals is a concise overview that should highlight major pros of this language, which has many more useful features. We hope that classes, arrow function declaration, comprehensions, splats, and the clean syntax were enough to spark interest and lead to more exploration and experimentation with CoffeeScript.

Backbone.js is the cornerstone of all JavaScript frameworks because it’s one of the most mature  i.e., dependable  and popular solutions in the ever-growing multitudes of browser JavaScript MV*  model-view-controllers and model-view-something  frameworks. If we draw a quick comparison between Backbone.js and other frameworks  not a fair one but still might be useful for some readers , it will be somewhere in the middle in complexity and features between Spine¹&KnockoutJS²  the lighter side  and Ember.js³&Angular.js⁴  heavier side . Which one to choose depends on whether developers will have to customize a lot  go with lightweights  or use right-out-of-the-box  go with heavyweights . A bit of trivia: Backbone.js was created by the same person  Jeremy Ashmenas⁵  that brought CoffeeScript and Underscore.js to the world! Therefore, we’ll demonstrate how to build a Backbone.js simple application from scratch. This is not your typical to-do list, examples of which you can find plenty at TodoMVC⁶, but a simplified application that is easier to understand but that still uses all components: views, collections, subviews, models, and event binding. The example is the apple database application. In this chapter we’ll cover following:    Typical Backbone.js App Structure   Setting up Backbone.js App from Scratch   Dependencies for the Backbone.js Project   Working with Backbone.js Collections   Event Binding with Backbone.js and jQuery   Backbone.js View and Subviews with Backbone.js Underscore.js   Super Simple Backbone Starter Kit   Conclusion ¹http:  spinejs.com  ²http:  knockoutjs.com  ³http:  emberjs.com  ⁴https:  angularjs.org  ⁵https:  twitter.com jashkenas ⁶http:  todomvc.com    Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  26  3.1 Typical Backbone.js App Structure  There are just four classes in Backbone.js:    Router: mapping of URL to methods   View: methods related to browser&user events, HTML output  rendering    Collection: a list of models with extra helpers such as fetch     Model: an individual data item with extra helpers  A typical Backbone.js app will have the main Router class. From that class all the routes  URL paths  will be defined. The router can create and call methods of other classes such as Views, Collections, and Models. For example, for path  books we’ll render books view. The recommended usage is that Views usually have one Collection or one Model. A Collection is just a list of Models. However, this is not written in stone. Backbone.js is very flexible and should be used according to the specific needs. For example, an application can have a Model that has Views and each View that has collections. In our concise example, we’ll have one main Router that has Views. These Views will have models and collections.  3.2 Setting up Backbone.js App from Scratch  Firstly, we’re going to build a typical starter “Hello World” application using Backbone.js and the model-view-controller  MVC  architecture. I know it might sound like overkill in the beginning, but as we go along we’ll add more and more complexity, including Models, Subviews and Collections. The structure of the project is keep it simple stupid:    index.html: the main file and all the application’s JavaScript code   jquery.js: jQuery library   underscore.js: Underscore.js library   backbone.js: Backbone.js library  A full source code for the “Hello World” app is available at GitHub under github.com azat- co rpjs backbone hello-world⁷. jQuery, Underscore are required dependencies for Backbone.js.  ⁷https:  github.com azat-co rpjs tree master backbone hello-world   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  27  3.3 Dependencies for the Backbone.js Project  To build our apple database, we’ll need to download the following libraries:    jQuery 1.9 development source file⁸   Underscore.js development source file⁹   Backbone.js development source file¹⁰  Alternatively, you can hot-like these libraries from some CDNs  e.g., Google Hosted Libraries¹¹ , but then we’ll need an internet connection every time you run your app. Include these frameworks in the newly created index.html file like this:              TODO write some awesome JS code!  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15                        Note We can also put   tags right after the   tag in the end of the file. This will change the order in which scripts and the rest of HTML are loaded and impact performance in large files.  Some developers shy away from using Backbone Router  it’s an optional class component , but we always find that Router brings more benefits and clarity. In a way, it serves as a starting point of your application and helps to understand the foundation and how all the pieces fit together such as views, models, etc. So, let’s define a simple Backbone.js Router inside of a   tag:  ⁸http:  code.jquery.com jquery-1.9.0.js ⁹http:  underscorejs.org underscore.js ¹⁰http:  backbonejs.org backbone.js ¹¹https:  developers.google.com speed libraries devguide   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  28  ... var router = Backbone.Router.extend { } ; ...  Note For now, to Keep It Simple Stupid  KISS , we’ll be putting all of our JavaScript code right into the index.html file. This is not a good idea for a real development or production code. We’ll refactor it later.  Then set up a special routes property inside of an extend call:  var router = Backbone.Router.extend {  routes: { } } ;  The Backbone.js routes property needs to be in the following format: 'path :param': 'action' which will result in the filenamepath param URL triggering a function named action  defined in the Router object . For now, we’ll add a single home route:  This is good, but now we need to add a home function  the right part of the route: action key-value pair :  var router = Backbone.Router.extend {  routes: {  '': 'home'  } } ;  var router = Backbone.Router.extend {  routes: {  '': 'home'  }, home: function  {    TODO render html  } } ;  1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  We’ll come back to the home function later to add more logic for creating and rendering of a View. Right now, we should define our homeView:   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  29  1 2  var homeView = Backbone.View.extend { } ;  Does it look familiar to you? Right, Backbone.js uses similar syntax for all of its components, such as Backbone.View, Backbone.Router, Backbone.Model and Backbone.Collection. The class is followed by the extend function and a JSON object as a parameter to it. This object often contains some initialization options or attributes of the class. There are multiple ways to proceed from now on, but the best practice is to use the el and template properties, which are magical, i.e., special in Backbone.js, because they allow us to do two things:  1. el: attach the Backbone View object to a Document Object Model  DOM  element 2. template: store the Underscore  in this case we use Underscore but it can be changed to  another library  template  Here’s the code for the home view:  var homeView = Backbone.View.extend {  el: 'body', template: _.template 'Hello World'   } ;  The property el is just a string that holds the jQuery selector  you can use class name with ‘.’ and id name with ‘’ . The template property has been assigned an Underscore.js function template with just a plain text ‘Hello World’. To render our homeView we use this.$el which is a compiled jQuery object referencing element in an el property, and the jQuery .html   function to replace HTML with this.template   value. Here is what the full code for our home Backbone.js View looks like:  var homeView = Backbone.View.extend {  el: 'body', template: _.template 'Hello World' , render: function  {  this.$el.html this.template {}  ;  } } ;  Now, if we go back to the router we can add these two lines to the home function:  1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4 5 6 7   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  30     some awesome code that will be executed during object's creation  var router = Backbone.Router.extend {  routes: {  '': 'home'  }, initialize: function  {  }, home: function  {  this.homeView = new homeView; this.homeView.render  ;  } } ;  The first line will create the homeView object and assign it to the homeView property of the router. The second line will call the render   method in the homeView object, triggering the “Hello World” output. Finally, to start a Backbone app, we call new Router inside of a document-ready wrapper to make sure that the file’s DOM is fully loaded. The app variable is made global in this sense, this helps to access some Router properties  it’s a good idea to use a prefix specific to your application :  Confused so far? Don’t be because here is the full code of the index.html file:  var app; $ document .ready function  {  app = new router; Backbone.history.start  ;  }                       var app;  var router = Backbone.Router.extend {  routes: {  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  31  14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44  '': 'home'  }, initialize: function  {   some code to execute   when the object is instantiated }, home: function  {  this.homeView = new homeView; this.homeView.render  ;  } } ;  } } ;  }   var homeView = Backbone.View.extend {  el: 'body', template: _.template 'Hello World' , render: function  {  this.$el.html this.template {}  ;  $ document .ready function  {  app = new router; Backbone.history.start  ;                   Open index.html in the browser to see if it works, i.e., the “Hello World” message should be on the page.  3.4 Working with Backbone.js Collections  Backbone Collections are useful classes that developers can use for storing any sets of data that belong to the same type. In other words, Collections are sets or lists of models, and they  collections  can have their own custom methods and logic as well as some built-in Backbone methods.   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  32  The full source code of Backbone Collections example is under the GitHub’s rpjs backbone collec- tions¹². This example is about Backbone Collections, and it’s built on top of the previous “Hello World” example from the Setting up Backbone.js App from Scratch which is available for download at rpjs backbone hello-world¹³. We should add some data to play around with and to hydrate our views. To do this, add this right after the script tag and before the other code:  var appleData = [  name: "fuji", url: "img fuji.jpg"  name: "gala", url: "img gala.jpg"  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  {  }, {  }  ];  Grab the images  see picture below  from GitHub: https:  github.com azat-co rpjs tree master  backbone collections img, or add your own.  Fuji apple illustration  ¹²https:  github.com azat-co rpjs tree master backbone collections ¹³https:  github.com azat-co rpjs tree master backbone hello-world   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  33  Gala apple illustration  This is our apple database. :-  Or to be more accurate, our REST API endpoint-substitute, which provides us with names and image URLs of the apples  data models . If you want some real-world servers, you can use:    Parse.com¹⁴: back-end-as-a-service provider   Node.js and MongoDB REST API¹⁵: a free-JSON API built with Node.js, Express.js and  MongoDB  Note This mock dataset can be easily substituted by assigning REST API endpoints of your back- end to url properties in Backbone.js Collections and or Models, and calling the fetch   method on them.  ¹⁴http:  parse.com ¹⁵http:  webapplog.com express-js-4-node-js-and-mongodb-rest-api-tutorial    Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  34  Now to make the User Experience  UX  a little bit better, we can add a new route to the routes object in the Backbone Route:  ... routes: {  '': 'home', 'apples :appleName': 'loadApple'  This will allow users to go to index.htmlapples SOMENAME and expect to see some information about an apple. This information will be fetched and rendered by the loadApple function in the Backbone Router definition:  loadApple: function appleName {  this.appleView.render appleName ;  Have you noticed an appleName variable? It’s exactly the same name as the one that we’ve used in route. This is how we can access query string parameters  e.g., ?param=value&q=search  in Backbone.js. Now we’ll need to refactor some more code to create a Backbone Collection, populate it with data in our appleData variable, and to pass the collection to homeView and appleView. Conveniently enough, we do it all in the Router constructor method initialize:  initialize: function  {  var apples = new Apples  ; apples.reset appleData ; this.homeView = new homeView {collection: apples} ; this.appleView = new appleView {collection: apples} ;  At this point, we’re pretty much done with the Router class, and it should look like this:  1 2 3 4 5 6  1 2 3  1 2 3 4 5 6  }, ...  }  },   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  35  var router = Backbone.Router.extend {  routes: {  '': 'home', 'apples :appleName': 'loadApple'  }, initialize: function  {  var apples = new Apples  ; apples.reset appleData ; this.homeView = new homeView {collection: apples} ; this.appleView = new appleView {collection: apples} ;  }, home: function  {  this.homeView.render  ;  }, loadApple: function appleName {  this.appleView.render appleName ;  Let’s modify our homeView a bit to see the whole database:  var homeView = Backbone.View.extend {  el: 'body', template: _.template 'Apple data:  ' , render: function  {  this.$el.html this.template { data: JSON.stringify this.collection.models   } } ;  }  ; } } ;  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  1 2  For now, we just output the string representation of the JSON object in the browser. This is not user-friendly at all, but later we’ll improve it by using a list and subviews. So far, our apple Backbone Collection is very clean and simple:  var Apples = Backbone.Collection.extend { } ;  Note Backbone automatically creates models inside of a collection when we use the fetch   or reset   functions.   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  1 2 3 4 5  Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  36  Apple view is not any more complex; it has only two properties: template and render. In a template, we want to display figure, img and figcaption tags with specific values. The Underscore.js template engine is handy at this task:  var appleView = Backbone.View.extend {  template: _.template   ' \   " >\    \   ' ,  ... } ;  To make a JavaScript string, which has HTML tags in it, more readable we can use the backslash line breaker escape  \  symbol, or close strings and concatenate them with a plus sign  + . This is an example of appleView above, which is refactored using the latter approach:  var appleView = Backbone.View.extend {  template: _.template   ' '+  +' " >'+ +'   '+  +' ' ,  ...  Please note the ‘ ’ symbols; they are the instructions for Undescore.js to print values in properties url and name of the attributes object. Finally, we’re adding the render function to the appleView class.  render: function appleName {  var appleModel = this.collection.where {name:appleName} [0]; var appleHtml = this.template appleModel ; $ 'body' .html appleHtml ;  }  We find a model within the collection via where   method and use [] to pick the first element. Right now, the render function is responsible for both loading the data and rendering it. Later we’ll refactor the function to separate these two functionalities into different methods. The whole app, which is in the rpjs backbone collections index.html¹⁶ folder, looks like this:  ¹⁶https:  github.com azat-co rpjs tree master backbone collections   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  37  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42                     var appleData = [  name: "fuji", url: "img fuji.jpg"  {  }, {  name: "gala", url: "img gala.jpg"  } ]; var app; var router = Backbone.Router.extend {  routes: {  "": "home", "apples :appleName": "loadApple"  }, initialize: function  {  var apples = new Apples  ; apples.reset appleData ; this.homeView = new homeView {collection: apples} ; this.appleView = new appleView {collection: apples} ;  }, home: function  {  this.homeView.render  ;  }, loadApple: function appleName {  this.appleView.render appleName ;  } } ;  var homeView = Backbone.View.extend {  el: 'body', template: _.template 'Apple data:  ' , render: function  {   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  38  this.$el.html this.template { data: JSON.stringify this.collection.models   }  ; }   TODO subviews  } ;  var Apples = Backbone.Collection.extend {  } ; var appleView = Backbone.View.extend {  template: _.template ' \   " >\    \   ' ,    TODO re-write with load apple and event binding render: function appleName {  var appleModel = this.collection.where {  name:appleName  } [0]; var appleHtml = this.template appleModel ; $ 'body' .html appleHtml ;  } } ; $ document .ready function  {  app = new router; Backbone.history.start  ;  43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77  }                    Open collections index.html file in your browser. You should see the data from our “database”, i.e., Apple data: [{"name":"fuji","url":"img fuji.jpg"},{"name":"gala","url":"img gala.jpg"}]. Now, let’ go to collections index.htmlapples fuji or collections index.htmlapples gala in your browser. We expect to see an image with a caption. It’s a detailed view of an item, which in this case is an apple. Nice work!   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  39  3.5 Event Binding with Backbone.js and jQuery  In real life, getting data does not happen instantaneously, so let’s refactor our code to simulate it. For a better UI UX, we’ll also have to show a loading icon  a.k.a., spinner or ajax-loader, see the picture below  to users to notify them that the information is being loaded.  Spinner GIF  It’s a good thing that we have event binding in Backbone. The event binding is not an exclusive to Backbone feature, because it is part of jQuery. But without Backbone organization and code structure, things tend to end up messier  with plain jQuery . For example, we’ll have to pass a function that renders HTML as a callback to the data loading function, to make sure that the rendering function is not executed before we have the actual data to display. Therefore, when a user goes to detailed view  apples :id  we only call the function that loads the data. Then, with the proper event listeners, our view will automagically  this is not a typo  update itself; when there is a new data  or on a data change, Backbone.js supports multiple and even custom events . Let’s change the code in the router:  loadApple: function appleName {  this.appleView.loadApple appleName ;  1 2 3 4 5  ...  } ...  Everything else remains the same until we get to the appleView class. We’ll need to add a constructor or an initialize method, which is a special word property in the Backbone.js framework. It’s called each time we create an instance of an object, i.e., var someObj = new SomeObject  . We can also pass extra parameters to the initialize function, as we did with our views  we passed an object with the key collection and the value of apples Backbone Collection .

Now we need to create a model which will represent a single apple and set up proper event listeners on the model. We’ll use two types of events, change and a custom event called spinner. To do that, we are going to use the on   function, which takes these properties: on event, actions, context  — read more about it at backbonejs.org Events-on¹⁸:  ... var appleView = Backbone.View.extend {  this.model = new  Backbone.Model.extend {}  ; this.model.bind 'change', this.render, this ; this.bind 'spinner',this.showSpinner, this ;  The code above basically boils down to two simple things:  1. Call render   function of appleView object when the model has changed 2. Call showSpinner   method of appleView object when event spinner has been fired.  So far, so good, right? But what about the spinner, a GIF icon? Let’s create a new property in appleView:  templateSpinner: ' ',  Remember the loadApple call in the router? This is how we can implement the function in appleView:  ¹⁸http:  backbonejs.org Events-on   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  41  ... loadApple:function appleName {  this.trigger 'spinner' ;   show spinner GIF image var view = this;   we'll need to access that inside of a closure setTimeout function  {   simulates real time lag when   fetching data from the remote server  view.model.set view.collection.where {  name:appleName  } [0].attributes ;  },1000 ;  }, ...  The first line will trigger the spinner event  the function for which we still have to write . The second line is just for scoping issues  so we can use appleView inside of the closure . The setTimeout function is simulating a time lag of a real remote server response. Inside of it, we assign attributes of a selected model to our view’s model by using a model.set   function and a model.attributes property  which returns the properties of a model . Now we can remove an extra code from the render method and implement the showSpinner function:  render: function appleName {  var appleHtml = this.template this.model ; $ 'body' .html appleHtml ;  }, showSpinner: function  {  $ 'body' .html this.templateSpinner ;  } ...  That’s all! Open index.htmlapples gala or index.htmlapples fuji in your browser and enjoy the loading animation while waiting for an apple image to load.

Subviews are Backbone Views that are created and used inside of another Backbone View. A subviews concept is a great way to abstract  separate  UI events  e.g., clicks  and templates for similarly structured elements  e.g., apples . A use case of a Subview might include a row in a table, a list item in a list, a paragraph, a new line, etc. We’ll refactor our home page to show a nice list of apples. Each list item will have an apple name and a “buy” link with an onClick event. Let’s start by creating a subview for a single apple with our standard Backbone extend   function:  ... var appleItemView = Backbone.View.extend {  tagName: 'li', template: _.template ''  +' " target="_blank">' +' ' +' &nbsp; buy ' ,  events: {  'click .add-to-cart': 'addToCart'  ¹⁹https:  github.com azat-co rpjs tree master backbone subview   10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  1 2 3  1 2 3 4 5 6  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  } } ; ...  ...  ...  Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  45  }, render: function   {  }, addToCart: function  {  this.$el.html this.template this.model.attributes  ;  this.model.collection.trigger 'addToCart', this.model ;  Now we can populate the object with tagName, template, events, render and addToCart proper- ties methods.  ... tagName: 'li', ...  tagName automatically allows Backbone.js to create an HTML element with the specified tag name, in this case   — list item. This will be a representation of a single apple, a row in our list.  ... template: _.template ''  +' " target="_blank">' +' ' +' &nbsp; buy ' ,  The template is just a string with Undescore.js instructions. They are wrapped in   symbols. <%= simply means print a value. The same code can be written with backslash escapes:  ... template: _.template '\   " target="_blank">\  \  &nbsp; buy \ ' ,  Each   will have two anchor elements    , links to a detailed apple view  apples :appleName  and a buy button. Now we’re going to attach an event listener to the buy button:   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  46  ... events: {  }, ...  'click .add-to-cart': 'addToCart'  The syntax follows this rule:  1  event + jQuery element selector: function name  1  'click .add-to-cart': 'addToCart'  1  'click load-more': 'loadMoreData'  Both the key and the value  right and left parts separated by the colon  are strings. For example:  To render each item in the list, we’ll use the jQuery html   function on the this.$el jQuery object, which is the   HTML element based on our tagName attribute:  ... render: function   {  this.$el.html this.template this.model.attributes  ;  The addToCart method will use the trigger   function to notify the collection that this particular model  apple  is up for the purchase by the user:  addToCart: function  {  this.model.collection.trigger 'addToCart', this.model ;  Here is the full code of the appleItemView Backbone View class:  1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5  or  }, ...  ...  } ...   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5 6  Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  47  ... var appleItemView = Backbone.View.extend {  tagName: 'li', template: _.template ''  +' " target="_blank">' +' ' +' &nbsp; buy ' ,  events: {  'click .add-to-cart': 'addToCart'  }, render: function   {  }, addToCart: function  {  this.$el.html this.template this.model.attributes  ;  this.model.collection.trigger 'addToCart', this.model ;  } } ; ...  Easy peasy! But what about the master view, which is supposed to render all of our items  apples  and provide a wrapper   container for   HTML elements? We need to modify and enhance our homeView. To begin with, we can add extra properties of string type understandable by jQuery as selectors to homeView:  We can use properties from above in the template, or just hard-code them  we’ll refactor our code later  in homeView:  ... el: 'body', listEl: '.apples-list', cartEl: '.cart-box', ...  ... template: _.template 'Apple data: \   \  \   ' ,  ...  The initialize function will be called when homeView is created  new homeView    — in it we render our template  with our favorite by now html   function , and attach an event listener to the collection  which is a set of apple models :   1 2 3 4 5 6  1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  ...  }, ...  ...  }, ...  } ;  } ...  Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  48  initialize: function   {  this.$el.html this.template ; this.collection.on 'addToCart', this.showCart, this ;  The syntax for the binding event is covered in the previous section. In essence, it is calling the showCart   function of homeView. In this function, we append appleName to the cart  along with a line break, a   element :  showCart: function appleModel  {  $ this.cartEl .append appleModel.attributes.name+' ' ;  Finally, here is our long-awaited render   method, in which we iterate through each model in the collection  each apple , create an appleItemView for each apple, create an   element for each apple, and append that element to view.listEl —   element with a class apples-list in the DOM:  ... render: function  {  view = this;   so we can use view inside of closure this.collection.each function apple {  var appleSubView = new appleItemView {model:apple} ;    creates subview with model apple appleSubView.render  ;    compiles template and single apple data $ view.listEl .append appleSubView.$el ;   append jQuery object from single   apple to apples-list DOM element  Let’s make sure we didn’t miss anything in the homeView Backbone View:   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  49  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  ... var homeView = Backbone.View.extend {  el: 'body', listEl: '.apples-list', cartEl: '.cart-box', template: _.template 'Apple data: \   \  \   ' ,  initialize: function   {  this.$el.html this.template ; this.collection.on 'addToCart', this.showCart, this ;  }, showCart: function appleModel  {  $ this.cartEl .append appleModel.attributes.name+' ' ;  }, render: function  {  view = this;   so we can use view inside of closure this.collection.each function apple {  var appleSubView = new appleItemView {model:apple} ;    create subview with model apple appleSubView.render  ;    compiles tempalte and single apple data $ view.listEl .append appleSubView.$el ;   append jQuery object from single apple   to apples-list DOM element  } ;  } } ; ...  You should be able to click on the buy, and the cart will populate with the apples of your choice. Looking at an individual apple does not require typing its name in the URL address bar of the browser anymore. We can click on the name, and it opens a new window with a detailed view.   Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  50  The list of apples rendered by subviews.  By using subviews, we reused the template for all of the items  apples  and attached a specific event to each of them. Those events are smart enough to pass the information about the model to other objects: views and collections.

Backbone.js FUNdamentals: The Cornerstone of JavaScript MV* Frameworks  54  3.7 Super Simple Backbone Starter Kit  To jump-start your Backbone.js development, consider using Super Simple Backbone Starter Kit²¹ by Azator²², or similar projects like:    Backbone Boilerplate²³   Sample App with Backbone.js and Twitter Bootstrap²⁴   More Backbone.js tutorials²⁵  3.8 Conclusion  The already-mentioned in this chapter, and reputable Addy’s²⁶ TodoMVC²⁷ resource contains a lot of browser JavaScript MV* frameworks with tutorials and examples. I often get asked “What do you think of X or Y?” The main point is not to get into analysis paralysis when choosing a front-end framework. Learn the foundation with Backbone.js, just because it’s not so bloated and complicated, yet so widely-used and powerful in the right hands. Then pick a few newer and shinier libraries  e.g., React.js, Angular.js  and see how they fit the particular goals of project at hand.  ²¹https:  github.com azat-co super-simple-backbone-starter-kit ²²http:  azat.co ²³http:  backboneboilerplate.com  ²⁴http:  coenraets.org blog 2012 02 sample-app-with-backbone-js-and-twitter-bootstrap  ²⁵https:  github.com documentcloud backbone wiki Tutorials%2C-blog-posts-and-example-sites ²⁶https:  github.com addyosmani ²⁷http:  todomvc.com    4 Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript  on The Server  Node.js is a highly efficient and scalable non-blocking I O platform that was build on top of Google Chrome V8 engine and its ECMAScript. This means that most front-end JavaScript  another implementation of ECMAScript  objects, functions and methods are available in Node.js. Please refer to JavaScript FUNdamentals¹ if you need a refresher on JS-specific basics.  ¹http:  webapplog.com js-fundamentals    Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  56  Developers can install Node.js from its website² and follow this overview of main Node.js concepts. For more meticulous Node.js instructions, take a look at Rapid Prototyping with JS: Agile JavaScript Development³ and Node School⁴.  ²http:  nodejs.org ³http:  rpjs.co ⁴http:  nodeschool.io   Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  57  4.1 Read-Eval-Print Loop  a.k.a. Console  in Node.js  Like in many other programming language and platforms, Node.js has a read-eval-print loop tool which is opened by $ node command. The prompt changes to > and we can execute JavaScript akin to Chrome Developer Tools console. There are slight deviations in ECMAScript implementations in Node.js and browsers  e.g., {}+{} , but for the most part the results are similar.   Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  58  So as you see, we can write JavaScript in the console all day long, but sometime we can to save script so we can run them later.  4.2 Launching Node.js Scripts  To start a Node.js script from a file, simply run $ node filename, e.g., $ node program.js. If all we need is a quick set of statements, there’s a -e option that allow to run inline JavaScript Node.js, e.g., $ node -e "console.log new Date   ;".  4.3 Node.js Process Information  Each Node.js script that is running is a process in its essence. For example, ps aux  grep 'node' will output all Node.js programs running on a machine. Conveniently, developers can access useful process information in code with process object, e.g., node -e "console.log process.pid ":   Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  59  Node.js process examples using pid and cwd.  4.4 Accessing Global Scope in Node.js  As you know from JS FUNdamentals⁵, browser JavaScript by default puts everything into its global scope. This was coined as one of the bad part of JavaScript in Douglas Crockford’s famous [JavaScript: The Good Parts]. Node.js was designed to behave differently with everything being local by default. In case we need to access globals, there is a global object. Likewise, when we need to export something, we should do so explicitly. In a sense, window object from front-end browser JavaScript metamorphosed into a combination of global and process objects. Needless to say, the document object that represent DOM of the webpage is nonexistent in Node.js.  4.5 Exporting and Importing Modules  Another bad part in browser JavaScript is that there’s no way to include modules. Scripts are supposed to be linked together using a different language  HTML  with a lacking dependency  ⁵http:  webapplog.com    Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  60  management. CommonJS⁶ and RequireJS⁷ solve this problem with AJAX-y approach. Node.js borrowed many things from the CommonJS concept. To export an object in Node.js, use exports.name = object;, e.g.,  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  var messages = {  find: function req, res, next  { ... }, add: function req, res, next  { ... }, format: 'title  date  author'  } exports.messages = messages;  While in the file where we import aforementioned script  assuming the path and the file name is route messages.js :  1  var messages = require '. routes messages.js' ;  However, sometime it’s more fitting to invoke a constructor, e.g., when we attach properties to Express.js app  more on Express.js in Express.js FUNdamentals: An Essential Overview of Express.js⁸ . In this case module.exports is needed:  module.exports = function app  {  app.set 'port', process.env.PORT  3000 ; app.set 'views', __dirname + ' views' ; app.set 'view engine', 'jade' ; return app;  1 2 3 4 5 6  }  In the file that includes the example module above:  ⁶http:  www.commonjs.org  ⁷http:  requirejs.org  ⁸http:  webapplog.com express-js-fundamentals    1 2 3 4 5  1 2  Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  61  ... var app = express  ; var config = require '. config index.js' ; app = config app ; ...  The more succinct code: var = express  ; require '. config index.js'  app ;. The most common mistake when including modules is a wrong path to the file. For core Node.js modules, just use the name without any path, e.g., require ‘name’ . Same goes for modules in node_- modules folder. More on that later in the NPM section. For all other files, use . with or without a file extension, e.g.,  var keys = require '. keys.js' ,  messages = require '. routes messages.js' ;  In addition, for the latter category it’s possible to use a longer looking statements with __dirname and path.join  , e.g., require path.join __dirname, ,’routes’, ‘messages’  ;‘ If require   points to a folder, Node.js will attempt to read index.js file in that folder.  4.6 Buffer is a Node.js Super Data Type  Buffer is a Node.js addition to four primitives  boolean, string, number and RegExp  and all- encompassing objects  array and functions are also objects  in front-end JavaScript. We can think of buffers as extremely efficient data stores. In fact, Node.js will try to use buffers any time it can, e.g., reading from file system, receiving packets over the network.  4.7 __dirname vs. process.cwd  __dirname is an absolute path to the file in which this global variable was called, while process.cwd is an absolute path to the process that runs this script. The latter might not be the same as the former if we started the program from a different folder, e.g., $ node . code program.js.  4.8 Handy Utilities in Node.js  Although, the core of the Node.js platform was intentionally kept small it has some essential utilities such as   Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  62    URL⁹   Crypto¹⁰   Path¹¹   String Decoder¹²  Node.js  if  err  throw err; console.log data ;  And the writing to the file:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  1 2 3 4 5  } ;  } ;  The method that we use in this tutorials is path.join and it concatenates path using an appropriate folder separator    or \\ .  4.9 Reading and Writing from to The File System in  Reading from files is done via the core fs module¹³. There are two sets of methods: async and sync. In most cases developers should use async methods, e.g., fs.readFile¹⁴:  var fs = require 'fs' ; var path = require 'path' ; fs.readFile path.join __dirname, ' data customers.csv' , {encoding: 'utf-8'}, fun\ ction  err, data  {  var fs = require 'fs' ; fs.writeFile 'message.txt', 'Hello World!', function  err  {  if  err  throw err; console.log 'Writing is done.' ;  4.10 Streaming Data in Node.js  Streaming data is a term that mean an application processes the data while it’s still receiving it. This is useful for extra large datasets, like video or database migrations. Here’s a basic example on using streams that output the binary file content back:  ⁹http:  nodejs.org api url.html ¹⁰http:  nodejs.org api crypto.html ¹¹http:  nodejs.org api path.html ¹²http:  nodejs.org api string_decoder.html ¹³http:  nodejs.org api fs.html ¹⁴http:  nodejs.org api fs.htmlfs_fs_readfile_filename_options_callback   Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  63  1 2  var fs = require 'fs' ; fs.createReadStream '. data customers.csv' .pipe process.stdout ;  By default, Node.js uses buffers for streams. For a more immersive training, take a loot at stream-adventure¹⁵ and Stream Handbook¹⁶.  4.11 Installing Node.js Modules with NPM  NPM comes with the Node.js platform and allows for seamless Node.js package management. The way npm install work is similar to Git in a way how it traverses the working tree to find a current project¹⁷. For starter, keep in mind that we need either the package.json file or the node_modules folder, in order to install modules locally with $ npm install name, for example $ npm install superagent; in the program.js: var suparagent = requier 'superagent' ;. The best thing about NPM is that it keep all the dependencies local, so if module A uses module B v1.3 and module C uses module B v2.0  with breaking changes comparing to v1.3 , both A and C will have their own localized copies of different versions of B. This proves to be a more superior strategy unlike Ruby and other platforms that use global installations by default. The best practice is not to include a node_modules folder into Git repository when the project is a module that supposed to be use in other application. However, it’s recommended to include node_- modules for deployable applications. This prevents a breakage caused by unfortunate dependency update. Note: The NPM creator like to call it npm  lowercase¹⁸ .  4.12 Hello World Server with HTTP Node.js Module  Although, Node.js can be use for a wide variety of tasks, it’s mostly knows for building web applications. Node.js is thrives in the network due to its asynchronous nature and build-in modules such as net and http. Here’s a quintessential Hello World examples where we create a server object, define request handler  function with req and res arguments , pass some data back to the recipient and start up the whole thing.  ¹⁵http:  npmjs.org stream-adventure ¹⁶https:  github.com substack stream-handbook ¹⁷https:  npmjs.org doc files npm-folders.html ¹⁸http:  npmjs.org doc misc npm-faq.htmlIs-it-npm-or-NPM-or-Npm   1 2 3 4 5 6  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  64  var http = require 'http' ; http.createServer function  req, res  {  res.writeHead 200, {'Content-Type': 'text plain'} ; res.end 'Hello World\n' ;  } .listen 1337, '127.0.0.1' ; console.log 'Server running at http:  127.0.0.1:1337 ' ;]  The req and res parameters have all the information about a given HTTP request and response correspondingly. In addition, req and res can be used as streams  look in the previous section .  4.13 Debugging Node.js Programs  The best debugger is console.log  , but sometime we need to see the call stack and orient ourselves in async code a bit more. To do that, put debugger statements in your code and use $ node debug program.js to start the debugging process¹⁹. For more developer-friendly interface, download node inspector²⁰.  4.14 Taming Callbacks in Node.js  Callbacks²¹ are able to Node.js code asynchronous, yet programmers unfamiliar with JavaScript, who come from Java or PHP, might be surprised when they see Node.js code described on Callback Hell²²:  fs.readdir source, function err, files  {  if  err  {  } else {  console.log 'Error finding files: ' + err   files.forEach function filename, fileIndex  {  console.log filename  gm source + filename .size function err, values  {  if  err  {  } else {  console.log 'Error identifying file size: ' + err   console.log filename + ' : ' + values  aspect =  values.width   values.height  widths.forEach function width, widthIndex  {  ¹⁹http:  nodejs.org api debugger.html ²⁰https:  github.com node-inspector node-inspector ²¹https:  github.com maxogden art-of-nodecallbacks ²²http:  callbackhell.com    Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  65  height = Math.round width   aspect  console.log 'resizing ' + filename + 'to ' + height + 'x' + height  this.resize width, height .write destination + 'w' + width + '_' + fi\  if  err  console.log 'Error writing file: ' + err   14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  lename, function err  {  }   }.bind this    }  }   }   } }   There’s nothing to be afraid of here as long as two-space indentation is used. ;-  However, callback code can be re-write with the use of event emitters, promises or by utilizing the async library.  4.15 Introduction to Node.js with Ryan Dahl  Last, but not least, take a few minutes and watch this Introduction to Node.js with Ryan Dahl video²³.  4.16 Moving Forward with Express.js  After you’ve mastered Node.js basics in this article, you might want to read Express.js FUNdamen- tals: An Essential Overview of Express.js²⁴ and consider working on an interactive class²⁵ about the Express.js framework which is as of today is the most popular module on NPM.  ²³http:  www.youtube.com embed jo_B4LTHi3I ²⁴http:  webapplog.com express-js-fundamentals ²⁵http:  webapplog.com expressworks   Node.js FUNdamentals: JavaScript on The Server  66   5 Express.js FUNdamentals: The Most  Popular Node.js Framework  Express.js is an amazing framework for Node.js projects and used in the majority of such web apps. Unfortunately, there’s a lack of tutorials and examples on how to write good production-ready code. To mitigate this need, we released Express.js Guide: The Comprehesive Book on Express.js¹. However, all things start from basics, and for that reason we’ll give you a taste of the framework in this post, so you can decide if you want to continue the learning further.  5.1 Express.js Installation  Assuming you downloaded and installed Node.js  and NPM with it , run this command:  1  $ sudo npm install -g express@3.4.3  5.2 Express.js Command-Line Interface  Now we can use command-line interface  CLI  to spawn new Express.js apps:  1 2 3  $ express -c styl expressfun $ cd expressfun && npm install $ node app  Open browser at http:  localhost:3000. Here is the full code of expressfun app.js if you don’t have time to create an app right now:  ¹http:  expressjsguide.com   Express.js FUNdamentals: The Most Popular Node.js Framework  68  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  var express = require 'express' ; var routes = require '. routes' ; var user = require '. routes user' ; var http = require 'http' ; var path = require 'path' ;  var app = express  ;     all environments app.set 'port', process.env.PORT  3000 ; app.set 'views', __dirname + ' views' ; app.set 'view engine', 'jade' ; app.use express.favicon   ; app.use express.logger 'dev'  ; app.use express.bodyParser   ; app.use express.methodOverride   ; app.use app.router ; app.use express.static path.join __dirname, 'public'   ;     development only if  'development' == app.get 'env'   {  app.use express.errorHandler   ;  app.get ' ', routes.index ; app.get ' users', user.list ;  }  } ;  http.createServer app .listen app.get 'port' , function  {  console.log 'Express server listening on port ' + app.get 'port'  ;  5.3 Routes in Express.js  If you open the expressfun app.js, you’ll see two routes in the middle:  1 2 3 4  ... app.get ' ', routes.index ; app.get ' users', user.list ; ...  The first one is basically takes care of all the requests to the home page, e.g., http:  localhost:3000  and the latter of requests to  users, such as http:  localhost:3000 users. Both of the routes process URLs case insensitively and in a same manner as with trailing slashes.   Express.js FUNdamentals: The Most Popular Node.js Framework  69  The request handler itself  index.js in this case  is straightforward: every thing from the HTTP request is in req and write results to the response in res:  exports.list = function req, res {  res.send "respond with a resource" ;  };  5.4 Middleware as The Backbone of Express.js  Each line above the routes is a middleware:  app.use express.favicon   ; app.use express.logger 'dev'  ; app.use express.bodyParser   ; app.use express.methodOverride   ; app.use app.router ; app.use express.static path.join __dirname, 'public'   ;  1 2 3  1 2 3 4 5 6  The middleware is a pass thru functions that add something useful to the request as it travels along each of them, for example req.body or req.cookie. For more middleware writings check out Intro to Express.js: Parameters, Error Handling and Other Middleware².  5.5 Configuration of an Express.js App  Here is how we define configuration in a typical Express.js app:  1 2 3  app.set 'port', process.env.PORT  3000 ; app.set 'views', __dirname + ' views' ; app.set 'view engine', 'jade' ;  An ordinary settings involves a name  e.g., views  and a value  e.g., path to the folder where out templates views live . There are more than one way to define a certain settings, e.g, app.enable for boolean flags.  5.6 Jade is Haml for Express.js Node.js  Jade template engine is akin to Ruby on Rails’ Haml in the way it uses whitespace and indentation, e.g., layout.jade:  ²http:  webapplog.com intro-to-express-js-parameters-error-handling-and-other-middleware    Express.js FUNdamentals: The Most Popular Node.js Framework  70  doctype 5 html  head  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  body  block content  title= title link rel='stylesheet', href=' stylesheets style.css'   Other than that, it’s possible to utilize full-blown JavaScript code inside of Jade templates.  5.7 Conclusion About The Express.js Framework  As you’ve seen, it’s effortless to create MVC web apps with Express.js. The framework is splendid for REST APIs as well. If you interested in them, visit the Tutorial: Node.js and MongoDB JSON REST API server with Mongoskin and Express.js³ and Intro to Express.js: Simple REST API app with Monk and MongoDB⁴. If you want to know what are the other middlewares and configurations, check out Express.js API docs⁵, Connect docs⁶ and of course our book â€” Express.js Guide⁷. For those who already familiar with some basics of Express.js, I recommend going through ExpressWorks⁸ â€” an automated Express.js workshop.  5.8 Update  For migrating from Express.js 3.x to 4.x take a look at this guide: Migrating Express.js 3.x to 4.x: Middleware, Route and Other Changes⁹.  ³http:  webapplog.com tutorial-node-js-and-mongodb-json-rest-api-server-with-mongoskin-and-express-js  ⁴http:  webapplog.com intro-to-express-js-simple-rest-api-app-with-monk-and-mongodb  ⁵http:  expressjs.com api.html ⁶http:  www.senchalabs.org connect  ⁷http:  expressjsguide.com ⁸http:  webapplog.com expressworks ⁹http:  webapplog.com migrating-express-js-3-x-to-4-x-middleware-route-and-other-changes    6 About the Author  Azat Mardan: A software engineer, author and yogi.
