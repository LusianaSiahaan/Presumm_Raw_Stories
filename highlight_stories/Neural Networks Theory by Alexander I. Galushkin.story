Kuzin, and Yakov Z. Tsypkin   Foreword  Professor A. I. Galushkin’s monograph “Neural Networks Theory” appears at a time when the theory has achieved maturity and is the fulcrum of a vast literature. Never- theless, Professor Galushkin’s work has high importance because it serves a special purpose which is explained in the following.  The roots of neural networks theory go back to the pioneering work of McCulloch and Pitts in the early 1940s. As a graduate student at MIT and later as an instructor at Columbia University, I was a witness to the birth of the digital world that took place in the years following the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War. To me, the definitive event was Shannon’s first lecture on information theory which took place in New York in 1946. I attended his lecture and was utterly fascinated by what I heard. Wiener’s cybernetics and the invention of the transistor were the other defin- ing events which marked the debut of information revolution and the era of machine intelligence. The pioneering work of McCulloch and Pitts was too embryonic to at- tract much attention.  The work of McCulloch and Pitts was followed in the early 1950s by the develop- ment of threshold logic for pattern classification and automata theory for systems analysis. These developments were the backdrop for Frank Rosenblatt’s invention of the perceptron – the forerunner of multilayer neural networks. Frank Rosenblatt was a visionary who believed that the perceptron could perform miracles. Unfortunately, his lectures were hard to follow and not persuasive. His revolutionary ideas were not accorded recognition in his prematurely ended lifetime.  In the early 1960s at Moscow’s famed Institute of Automatics and Telemechanics, Ya Z. Tsypkin, M. A. Aizerman and others began to develop a theory of adaptive sys- tems which led to the initiation of research on neural networks in the Soviet Union and to  later  work  of Vapnik  and  Cherevonkis  on  support  vector  machines  and  kernel methods. Professor Galushkin was a student of Ya Z. Tsypkin and has played a pivotal role in the development of neural networks theory and its applications in the Soviet Union ever since.  Development of neural networks theory in the Soviet Union paralleled and, in some areas, especially in the realm of back propagation, was ahead. A detailed comparison and an overview are presented in Chap. 17 of Professor Galushkin’s work.  The extensive development of neural networks theory in the Soviet Union was largely unknown in the Western world. One of the objectives of Professor Galushkin’s work is to bring this fact to light. In this perspective, Professor Galushkin’s monograph serves an important purpose. But perhaps more importantly, his work stands out as an au-   VIII  Foreword  thoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date account of neural networks theory and its wide-ranging applications. Particularly worthy of note are Professor Galushkin’s expo- sitions of optimal models of neural networks, structure optimization by topological characteristics, continual neural networks, optimal neural networks for multidimen- sional signals, multivariable function extremum search algorithms, random search algorithms for local and global extrema, implementation of minimum average risk function criteria, closed-loop neural networks operating on nonstationary patterns, selection of initial conditions for neural network adjustment, design of neural net- works for matrix inversion problems, informative feature selection, multilayer neural network functional liability, and neural network diagnostics. In these expositions, there is much that is new and not readily found in the Western literature.  There is a significant issue which is not addressed in Professor Galushkin’s work, namely, the role of neural networks theory in soft computing. In science, as in most other realms of human activity, there is a tendency to adopt a particular methodology and march under its banner, in the belief that this methodology is superior to all oth- ers. The principal thesis of soft computing is that there is much to be gained by form- ing an alliance of various computing methodologies and using them in combination rather than in a stand-alone mode. In soft computing, the principal members of the alliance are fuzzy logic, neurocomputing, evolutionary computing, probabilistic com- puting and machine learning, and the principal objective is to provide a foundation for the conception, design and utilization of intelligent systems. In recent years, a combi- nation which has received a great deal of attention is that of neurofuzzy systems. In such systems, the capability of neural networks to deal with classification, identifica- tion and adaptation is combined with the capability of fuzzy systems to deal with imprecision, uncertainty and partiality of information. As a result of synergism of fuzzy logic and neural networks theory, many applications exist in which better performance can be achieved through the use of a neurofuzzy system than through the use of a system which is strictly neuro or strictly fuzzy.  Professor Galushkin’s monograph has many unique features that in totality make his work an important contribution to the literature of neural networks theory. He and his publisher deserve profuse thanks and congratulations from all who are seri- ously interested in the foundations of neural networks theory, its evolution and its current status.  Lotfi A. Zadeh Professor in the Graduate School Director, Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing  BISC  Berkeley University, California May 2006   Foreword  The human brain is indeed a triumph of nature. Able to process information rapidly and efficiently via a system of neural networks consisting of vast numbers of neurons, the human brain has evolved to enable a greater awareness of itself and its actions within its environment: the mind.  Natural neural networks are highly complex, nonlinear systems with huge degrees of freedom that employ different principles of information processing from those of computers. Consequently, efforts to develop a viable neural networks theory have been avidly pursued by theoretical scientists for more than half a century. These attempts have had varying degrees of success  and failure ; however, as more remarkable ad- vances in brain science are made, brain-style computer technology is becoming in- creasingly more promising.  In the earliest days, neural network theories developed in America, Europe, Russia and Japan independently. While the scientific traditions for each of these regions are significantly different, Russian science is most unique due in part to its years of isola- tion from the Western world. Its researchers were able to deeply develop their own theories in mathematics, physics, control optimization theory and other disciplines, and results have been outstanding. Russia’s contribution to neural networks theory is yet another example.  Professor Galushkin, a leader in neural networks theory in Russia, uses mathematical methods in combination with complexity theory, nonlinear dynamics and optimiza- tion, concepts that are solidly grounded in Russian tradition. His theory is expansive: covering not only the traditional topics such as network architecture; it also addresses neural continua in function spaces. I am pleased to see his theory presented in its entirety here, for the first time for many, so that both the theory he developed and the approach he took to understand such complex phenomena can be fully appreciated.  Shun-ichi Amari Director of RIKEN Brain Science Institute June 2004, in Tokyo   Foreword  During the Soviet period, academic achievements in the Soviet Union in many fields of science and mathematics  particularly those not bearing directly on defense  be- came widely known and respected. Many important Soviet advances in physics, chem- istry, and mathematics were widely disseminated and objectively evaluated as being of the highest rank.  Contemporaneously, Soviet achievements in academic traditions bearing on space technology and defense were also obviously successful  as evidenced by world-class achievements in these endeavors . However, the details of the discoveries underlying these achievements were rarely communicated, and some were actively suppressed. From before 1960 through about 1990, meaningful contact between Soviet and West- ern  neural  network  research  was  all  but  eliminated.  The  1990s  were  a  decade  of ‘renormalization of contact’ that followed this long break.  Unlike their Western counterparts, Soviet researchers never experienced the full brunt of the ‘perceptron ice age,’ although their funding levels were somewhat reduced, since Soviet research resources were, to a degree, allocated in mimicry of the U.S. re- search agenda. Thus, as the volume of Western neural network research activity was reduced to a low level during 1969–1986, Soviet research remained active. This long period of isolated Soviet research was highly productive. Many themes and concepts unknown in the West emerged and were extensively pursued. A few of these were seen in the two learning theory books by Y. Z. Tsypkin  one of Professor Galushkin’s men- tors  that were translated into English and disseminated worldwide in the 1970s. But there was little Western follow-through on this unusual and somewhat alien material. This book is the long-awaited panoramic survey of the Soviet and Russian neural network intellectual tradition. It is a gold mine of important ideas and powerful results that are not available anywhere else in English translation. The author, Dr. A. I. Galushkin, is the leading Russian neural network expert and has been a leading Soviet and Rus- sian neural network researcher since the 1970s. Throughout this period, Dr. Galushkin has been afforded access to all significant Western neural network publications. As a result, this book is doubly valuable because it is written not just by an expert, but some- one who knows, and refers to in his writing, the intellectual traditions of the West.  Readers will find many unfamiliar and yet well-developed topics in this book, often with powerful mathematical results  e.g., learning laws  ready to be coded up and put to work. The book begins with a survey of the field of neural networks from both the implementation and the architectural points of view. This approach to the subject used to be popular in the West, back when “supercomputers” were less powerful and capa-   XII  Foreword  cious than today’s pocket computer. However, just because this approach has fallen out of favor in the West, there is every reason to believe that it will again become dominant as neural networks take on such important future areas as real-time engine control  e.g., for pulse detonation aviation propulsion engines, where every single impulse must be controlled in detail with many variable parameters uniquely set in a few microsec- onds , real-time millimeter-scale microwave beam control  at 10-nanosecond time scales at ranges of thousands of kilometers from the antenna array for space launches using ground-based energy , and, of course, for large-scale machine intelligence. Thus, a viewpoint that organizes the subject around implementation and architecture is, in reality, very forward-looking and valuable. The portions covering implementation re- liability and failure tolerance are similarly important, notwithstanding the current disinterest in these topics in the West.  An important fact about the organization of this book is that the topics that are covered in detail have essentially all found valuable applications  as this is a book on theory, these are not discussed, which is probably to the liking of the Russian Ministry of Defense . Not only are these useful topics, in most cases they are topics that have been less developed in the West. Take forward control, for example. This is NOT just what is often thought of as ‘open-loop control.’ It is NOT just adaptive-model-reference control. It encompasses these but allows for anticipatory system response prediction so that feedback corrections can begin to be issued long before large errors emerge in the controlled system. Thus, highly sophisticated models with  preemptive feedback  anticipating and correcting errors before they can occur  can be built using this theory  much along the lines of the most arcane cerebellum-cortex motor control models, but even  more  general .  This  theory  supports  development  of  controllers  for  complex environments in which almost every system state is novel and far from any training example  e.g., for walking robots .  Neural Networks Theory is a major contribution to the neural network literature. It is a treasure trove that should be mined by the thousands of researchers and practitio- ners worldwide who have not previously had access to the fruits of Soviet and Russian neural  network  research.  Dr.  Galushkin  is  to  be  congratulated  and  thanked  for  his completion of this monumental work: a book that only he could write. It is a major gift to the world.

computers of a new class. Their appearance was determined for two objective reasons: first, the principal stages of the development of modern elemental base technology that mainly determines the development of computer architecture, and second, practical requirements to solve specific problems in a faster and more economical manner.  As far back as the 1950s, the main reason for neural computer development appeared to be a development of the threshold logic that was permanently contradistinguished to the classical development of the elemental base on the basis of AND, OR, NOT, etc. This resulted in the implementation of a series of specific problem-oriented and ex- perimental universal neural computers in the 1960s and 1970s. The terms “neural com- puter” and “neurocomputer” are not associated with any feature or characteristic of the human or animal nervous system. They are associated only with the conditional name of a threshold element with the adjustable or fixed weights that implement an elementary transfer function of the neural cell. A sharp upswing of LSI technological development at the beginning of the 1970s, as well as the implementation primarily of microprocessor chips with the classic computer architecture was realized on the el- emental base on the basis of AND, OR, NOT, etc., resulting in the slowdown rather than complete termination of the development of the computing facilities based on the threshold logic elements. The next upswing at the beginning of the 1980s allowed one to redefine the problem of neural computers due to the fact that VLSI technology, rather than LSI technology, allowed one to implement in one or several chips not only a great number of processing neuron elements, but also a whole set of connections between them. This was not possible before. Such a possibility was provided by both electronic as well as optical implementation methods in the middle of the 1980s.  The main idea of the neural computer construction, either a problem-oriented or universal one, is to develop computers in the analog-digital form. In this regard, the “fast” analog part performs multidimensional operations on the threshold basis. The algorithms of the neural network coefficient adjustment are implemented either in the “fast” manner in the analog form, or in the “low-speed” manner in the form of special- ized digital circuits emulating neural algorithms, or in the “low-speed” manner in the digital form, for example, using the universal personal computer.  The  development  of  neural  computers  requires  a  design  of  the  principally  new algorithms for the multidimensional solution of problems. The time for the solution of the  specific  problem, on the one hand, only linearly depends upon the problem   2  I  ·  Introduction  dimensionality and, on the other hand, is determined by the convergence time of the iteration process for the solution in the particular neural network.  The main formal basis for the design of the neural algorithms is a neural network theory [I-1 to I-7]. Let us call the main set of operations that are realized in the process of the algorithm refinement as a “logical basis of the problem”. For the majority of problems such a basis is the basis {Σa_x_ }. The following problems require this basis: the problems of vector algebra, Fourier transformation and optimization problems.  A class of tasks including solutions of the ordinary differential equations, Poisson, Euler, Navier-Stokes equations, elliptical equations and so on can be reduced to the aforementioned problems.  A logical basis of the computer system is the main group of operations implemented by the elements of the basic operating device. In the case of classical computers, it is a basis of AND, OR, NOT that forms, first, the level of more complex basis  Sheffer stroke, multiple AND, OR, NOT, etc. , and a macro level, i.e., a level of microdevices. The logical basis of the computer system is not determined by the logical basis of the solved problems but requires an additional application of a rather complex program development system. In the case of neural computers, the logical basis of the computer system in the , sign}. This basis maximally corresponds to the logical  simplest case is the basis {Σa_x_ basis of the major solved problems.  When solving problems with the neural computers’ logical basis, the basis of the problem is in accordance with the basis of the computer system, and there are no ar- tificial shifts in any direction:   cid:1  one such shift corresponds to the problems with the threshold basis, whereas the  basis of the computer system is AND, OR, NOT;   cid:1  another shift corresponds to the problem with the basis that differs from the thresh-  old one, whereas the computer system is neural.  It is supposed that the accordance between the computer system basis and the basis of the problem provides the highest productivity. This statement is trivial in the case of problem-oriented computers that are designed for the solution of a given specific task. However, it is not trivial for the neural computers that pretend to be called uni- versal at the present time.  All the difficulties of multiextremal search by iteration methods using neural com- puters are evidently preserved. But these difficulties transfer from the software imple- mentation  von-Neumann computers, computers with SIMD and MIMD architectures  to the software hardware implementation. In short, an algorithmic kernel of the main array of applied problems can be realized in hardware or software hardware form with maximal operation speed. The neural computer is a maximally parallelized system for a given algorithmic kernel implementation. The number of operation cycles in the problem solving process, i.e., the number of the adjustment cycles for optimization of the secondary functional in the neural computer, is not determined by the subjective intuition of the circuit designer who distributes the processing among the circuit lay- ers consisting of the Boolean elements. This number is also not determined by the subjective views of the programmer who organizes the interaction between layers. On the contrary, it is determined by the physical entity and complexity of the problem.   I.1  ·  Neural Computers  3  Homogeneous neural networks possess properties of gradual degradation when some of its elements break down. This phenomenon was noticed by Rosenblatt while designing the three-layer perceptron with the arbitrary connections in the first layer. An excessive number of elements in the first layer were taken. In this case, a function implemented by the neural network is quasi-distributed along the structure. Neural computers are the first example of an analytically calculated computer structure rather than an empirically designed structure based on some subjective views about the prob- lem and the elemental base.  The neural computer implementation methods are mainly divided into three classes:  1. Software emulation of neural algorithms with the help of computers with SISD archi- tecture  for example, classical personal computers , SIMD architecture  for example, Connection Machines  or MIMD architecture  for example, transputer networks ;  2. Software hardware  emulation  of  neural  units  on  the  digital  elemental  base  that provides an accelerated performance for the array of operations in the threshold basis and, first of all, such operations as multiplying and addition  Weitek proces- sors, signal processors of the TMS32020 type, etc. ;  3. Hardware implementation of the neural unit on the elemental base that is charac- teristic of the neural algorithms  CMOS-neurochip, optically controlled transmis- sion-type indicators, holographics, etc. ;  The efficiency of the neural algorithm implementation for specific problems in-  creases from variant 1 to variant 2 and further to variant 3.  In the case of hardware implementation of the neural unit or software hardware emulation, the neural computer represents a classical structure of the problem-ori- ented computer with SIMD architecture. In more complex cases, it represents a mixed MSIMD architecture. Then the computer is a network of asynchronously operating computer units, each one connected with a unit of synchronously operating elements that implement a part of the neural algorithm.  Supercomputers, such as CRAY XMP, and CYBER 205 had enormous computer ca- pacity. However, they were very expensive and their architecture was not in accordance with principles of the neural processing. The high processing capacity was achieved due to the array processors, special pipelined processors, and reduced cycle time. As a rule, such supercomputers were constructed on the basis of modern technology, and they reached a point of their development when further increase of operation speed was restricted by physical limitations for signal propagation in computer circuits. The outcome of this “technological” dead-end was achieved by the use of fine-grained pro- cessing that was implemented by computers with SIMD and MIMD architectures of Con- nection Machine type, Intel Hypercube type, Ncube type, Meiko Computing Surface type and so on. In particular, this outcome was achieved by the use of “neural” processing.  Different approaches for the revelation of parallelism and its implementation on  the parallel processors exist:   cid:1  Parallelism of sub-problems or events;  cid:1  Explicit algorithmic parallelism;  cid:1  Geometric parallelism.   4  I  ·  Introduction  The first type of parallelism is efficient for the program that is executed many times with different parameters. It is desirable in this case to represent this program with a set of independent sub-problems  each neuron with its own parameters  and to per- form the sub-problems in parallel on different processors.  The array processor for floating-point multiplication is an example of algorithmic parallelism implementation. Organization of parallel processing in this case consists in the appointment of different sub-problems for the pipeline of processors, each of which performs some operation over the data and transfers the result further. In order to provide the efficient performance of the pipeline, one must balance the processors’ loading and access and take into account the time required for data transfer from one processing stage to another.  Geometric parallelism consists in data decomposition among processors in such a way that all the required data are located in the random access memory of one processor or also closely located processors. This geometric parallelism is a standard approach that is used for the computers with SIMD architecture. The practical experience shows that a lot of calculations required for the neural network modeling are local. This fact makes real the neural computer implementation related to the geometric parallelism. That is why neural computers with hardware or software hardware implementation of the neural unit are related to the classes of SIMD or MSIMD architecture, as mentioned above.  A shining example of mathematical operation, in which parallel implementation cor- responds to the processes taking place in the neural network, is the operation of multipli- cation of matrix by vector. In this case, the vector represents an input signal for a one-layer neural network, and the matrix represents coefficients of the layer neurons. The output neural network signals represent a result of multiplication and nonlinear transformation. Neurocomputers are the object of interdisciplinary research. Consequently, defini- tions of the neurocomputer can be made only against the background of some more definitions that are adequate to the different branches of science.  Mathematical statistics. Neurocomputers are systems that allow one to form descrip- tions  of  stochastic  processes  and  their  assemblies  that  possess  complex  and  often multimodal or a priori unknown distribution functions.  Mathematical logic and automata theory. Neurocomputers are systems in which the algorithm of the solution is represented by the logic network of a particular form, namely by neurons with the complete elimination of Boolean elements of the AND, OR, NOT types. As a consequence, specific connections between elements are introduced.  Threshold logic  1950s and 1960s, computers on the base of threshold logic . Neuro- computers are systems in which the algorithm of the solution is represented in the form of the network with threshold elements with dynamically tunable coefficients and adjust- ment algorithms that are independent of the input space and network dimensionalities. Practically all the approaches based on the threshold logic have limitations similar to the Boolean elements. They depend on the network dimensionality and on the input space of elements. It takes place in spite of the fact that these approaches possess external evi- dence of the neural networks.   I.2  ·  Position of Neural Computers in the Set of Large-Powered Computing Facilities  5  Control  theory.  The  complexities  of  nonlinear  dynamic  control  system  synthesis are  well  known.  In  the  case  of  neural  computers,  these  complexities  are  partially overcome when a special case of a control object is taken. This object is well formal- ized and represents a multilayer neural network. A dynamic process of its adjustment represents a solution. Practically all synthesis methods for adaptive systems of con- trol are transferred to the neural networks in the form of this special case of the control object.  Computational mathematics. Neural computers implement solution algorithms in the form of neural networks. This provides the development of algorithms that are poten- tially much more parallel than any physical implementation. A set of neural network solution algorithms represents a new perspective field of computational mathematics conditionally called neural mathematics.  Computer engineering. From the viewpoint of computer engineering, the neural com- puter is a computer system with MSIMD architecture with the following three princi- pal technology solutions:   cid:1  The processor element of the uniform structure is simplified up to the level of a  neuron;   cid:1  Connections between elements are very complex;  cid:1  Programming of computational structure is transferred to the adjustment of con-  nection weighting coefficients between processor elements.  A general definition of the neurocomputer. The neurocomputer is a computer sys- tem with hardware and software architecture that is adequate to the algorithm execu- tion presented in the neural network logical basis.  I.2 Position of Neural Computers in the Set of Large-Powered Computing Facilities  One can conditionally divide the large-powered computing facilities into two classes: “large-grained”  consisting of a small number of processors  and “fine-grained”  con- sisting of hundreds and thousands of processors  ones. The neural computers relate to the fine-grained class.  The following class of computers is possible to consider as a new class of computing facilities. These are computers that solve a rather wide range of universal problems and require, as compared with the computers of traditional types, a new hardware imple- mentation, new program development systems and solution algorithms.  According to the given definition of the large-grained processing computer of CRAY type, the computer class “Elbrus” represents a new class of computers as compared with von Neumann computers. And the fine-grained processing computers with SIMD  Single Instruction – Multiple Data  architecture represent a new class of computers as compared with the large-grained processing computers.   6  I  ·  Introduction  previous one:  Each of the following computer classes represents a new class with respect to the   cid:1  Computers with von Neumann architecture;  cid:1  Large-grained processing computers of CRAY type such “Elbrus” computers;  cid:1  Fine-grained processing computers with SIMD architecture;  cid:1  Fine-grained processing computers with MIMD  Multiple Instruction – Multiple   cid:1  Fine-grained processing computers with the mixed architecture of MSIMD type  Data  architecture;   Multiple variant of SIMD ;   cid:1  Neural computers.  Computers with the SIMD architecture were the first fine-grained computers out of four such computers shown in Fig. I.1 in their evolutionary development. They were first designed in the middle of the 1970s. The processor in this case is a single-bit processor with some local memory. This resulted in the necessity to organize a synchronized performance of a set of such units in the process of sufficiently complex solutions.  The development of VLSI technology at the beginning of the 1980s gave rise to the construction of the first production prototypes of the fine-grained computers with MIMD  Multiple Instruction – Multiple Data  architecture. These devices were imple- mented in the form of asynchronous networks in the 16- and 32-bit microcomputer, including transputer networks.  Several designs of computers with mixed architecture were developed from 1985- 1988. They consisted of the kernel in the form of the network of asynchronously func- tioning processors. Each processor of such a kernel controls a synchronously function- ing network of the usual processors with local memory. Such an architecture is some- times called a multiple variant of SIMD  MSIMD .  The MSIMD architecture is a repetition of the attempt for the algorithm parallelizing on the basis of the network of synchronously functioning processors that is performed on the new qualitative level  MIMD . Such an attempt has been already implemented on the basis of SIMD structures.  In general, neural computers can be regarded as a particular case  or further devel- opment  of the computers with MSIMD architecture in which a synchronized unit at each of the asynchronously functioning “fine grain” computers represents not a simple “vulgar” network of single-bit processors with memory, but a meaningful synchro- nized unit performing a hardware software  better pure hardware  emulation of the neural algorithm. In the simplest case, such an algorithm represents an operation of multiplying a large dimensionality vector or matrix by a vector. But this occurs only in the simplest case. The neural computers represent a special case of the MSIMD struc- ture in which a synchronously functioning “cluster” of single-bit processors has a spe- cial organization that is close to the hardware software implementation of the main  Fig. I.1. Evolution of fine-grained computer development: SIMD – Single Instruction – Multiple Data; MIMD – Multiple Instruction – Multiple Data; MSIMD – Multiple variant of SIMD   I.2  ·  Position of Neural Computers in the Set of Large-Powered Computing Facilities  7  part of the algorithm. In the considered neural case, such a “cluster” represents a hard- ware software implementation of the “neural” kernel of a number of algorithms.  The hardware software implementation of the neural algorithms for the synchro- nized units of the neural computers most probably also provides the solution of two additional problems:  1. To minimize  or sometimes to eliminate completely  the information interchange between the nodes of the neural computer asynchronous kernel in the process of problem solving. Such a possibility is practically excluded for the majority of prob- lems in the transputer networks or similar systems.  2. To solve so-called weakly formalized problems, such as learning for the optimal  pattern recognition, self-learning  clusterization , etc.  It must be mentioned that at present, a supercomputing level is the most important application of neurocomputers out of any other possible applications. This level is characterized by the lack of a computing facility capacity under the existent limita- tions. In this case, the objective necessity for the neural computer architectural devel- opment in the form of the natural development of the MIMD architecture can be also explained by the fact that the natural desire of a design engineer to increase the capac- ity of the node or to increase the number of nodes in the MIMD architecture leads to the “dead state region”  Fig. I.2 . According to the price-capacity ratio criterion, the “dead state region” appears for the following two reasons:   cid:1  Objective existence of inter-node exchanges and increase of common losses required  for these exchanges when the number of nodes increases;   cid:1  Increase of the node cost when its capacity increases.  A dead-state character of the desire to increase the capacity of a computer with the MIMD architecture by means of increasing the capacity of the node or by increasing the number of nodes is determined by the fact that the capacity increases more slowly  or significantly more slowly  than the system cost. The reason for this observation is the higher rate of the node cost increase as compared to its capacity increase as well as the fact that under the increasing number of nodes, the losses required for the inter- node information exchanges in the process of problem solving also increase.  Fig. I.2. Illustration of limitation of the MIMD architectural develop- ment when the node capacity or the number of nodes in- creases   8  I  ·  Introduction  We consider that namely this is the main reason for the use of some synchronously functioning neural unit in each node of the MIMD architecture. Such a unit imple- ments the neural network in the hardware software  purely hardware in future  form. In turn, this neural network implements some given function.  Economic factors play and will play a significant role in the process of fine-grained super-computer development, especially in the development of computers with a great number of nodes. The cost increase of the transputer-like custom-designed LSI related to its complication and increase of capacity will determine its use not as a base element of a large array but as a base element of a “middle-size” commutation array. Hence, each node of the latter array is connected with some unit consisting of more uniform, i.e., less expensive, LSIs. These LSIs constitute some co-processor that is problem-ori- ented either by its structure  a network of single-bit processors with memory  or by its function  for example, a neural calculating machine .  We consider therefore that the role of custom-designed LSI-transputers and trans- puter-like elements with a structure complication and an enlarged number of transis- tors will decrease in the domain of computer facility development that corresponds to super-computers with fine-grained structure. The main tendency will consist in the massive  usage  of  the  aforementioned  elements  in  the  class  of  personal  computers  computer cards, accelerators  and super-personal computers  blocks of several cards for personal computers . They will be also used to a lesser degree in the class of su- per-mini computers  a column consisting of several dozen cards and several personal computers of Meiko and Megaframe types . The appearance of systems containing several thousands of transputers and transputer-like elements is an objective but tem- porary phenomenon in the class of super-computers. Moreover, this phenomenon takes place only in the domain of super-computer applications that require unique super- computer samples.  This suggests that in perspective, the development of supercomputers with the fine- grained transputer-type structure containing more than 10 000 nodes is only an utter- most trend. And evolution of this trend can be found in the architecture of a peripheral parts of each node in the commutation array of transputer elements of the future sys- tem. Taking into account all the aforementioned remarks, one can conclude that the neural computers represent an effective line for the development of super-computer architectures.  I.3 The Concept of Computer Universalism  Each computer is in some sense problem-oriented to the extent that it solves different problems with different efficiency. However, such specialization becomes less and less expressed in the course of development of each new class of computers, at least due to the enlargement of the application field. One can imagine a qualitative pattern reflect- ing  a  degree  of  universalism  of  different  computer  classes  at  each  current  time. A possible example is represented in Fig. I.3. At present, neural computers are “more problem-oriented” than transputer-like computers. In turn, transputer-like computers are more problem-oriented than single-processor ones. However, it is a question of time or resources dedicated by perforce to either line of development.   I.4  ·  Neural Computer Modularity  9  Fig. I.3. Qualitative pattern for the estimation of universalism level for computers of different classes  Fig. I.4. Illustration of qualitative pos- sibilities of parallelizing pre- sented by computing facilities of different classes  Figure I.4  shows  a  qualitative  illustration  of  potentialities  provided  by  the parallelizing of algorithms, presented by computing facilities of different classes ap- plied to the solution of some specified problem. The number of operations executed per computer cycle increases due to the increase of potential ability provided by the parallelizing process. As a result, the time required for the solution decreases.  I.4 Neural Computer Modularity  Neural computer modularity  modular extendibility  is determined by the objective requirement for the existence of a transputer or transputer-like kernel in its structure. Concrete examples of neural computer designs show that the intention to increase their capacity taking into account their real overall-structure characteristics requires the existence of a transputer or transputer-like kernel in their structure. Such a kernel is necessary for the organization of an asynchronous process of information transmis- sion between separate neural units both during preparation for the solution as well as during the solution process. The structure of such a transputer or transputer-like ker- nel can be different. Sometimes, when the number of asynchronously functioning nodes   10  I  ·  Introduction  is sufficiently large  several hundreds or thousands , it is necessary to transfer from the kernel structure of “lattice” or “torus” type to the structure of “hypercube” type in order to increase the equivalent traffic of information transmission in the kernel.  As distinct from computers with MIMD architecture  Fig. I.2 , the capacity of neu- ral computers is uncritical to the capacity of the node computers at the asynchronously functioning kernel. Therefore, there is no need to prove the necessity of capacity in- crease by means of the obligatory exaggeration of technology-based standards.  It is necessary to notice some properties of the asynchronous kernel of the neural computer.  The  hardware  and  software  compatibility  of  neural  computers  with transputers or with other transputer-like elements is preserved in the kernel construc- tion based on transputers. Neural computers  Fig. I.1  do not represent something exotic, as it was the case in the 1960s. They are a regular result of the evolutionary develop- ment of the architecture of fine-grained computers.  Similarly to the transputer systems, neural computers can be used at different levels  of implementation:   cid:1  Personal computer built-in boards;  cid:1  Personal computer units consisting of several boards;  cid:1  Columns with control personal computers;  cid:1  Assemblage of columns with control personal computers  super-computer level .  Similar to the case of transputer systems, the main goal of neural computer design is the achievement of super-computer or supercomputing level. That is why one must regard the construction of different neural boards for personal computers at present as a pure technological and instrumental stage or a stage of implementation of some insignificant problems. The main strategic problem remains to be the problem of neural super-computer development. As an example, one can consider the development of neural computers at TRW Company  MARK, Input, II, III, IV, V, etc. .  The asynchronous kernel in neural computers will mainly perform two functions:   cid:1  Preparation,  transmission  of  initial  data  and  receipt  of  calculation  results  from separate neural units at each node of the asynchronous kernel before the beginning of the solution;   cid:1  Messaging during the solution process when the problem is insufficiently prepared for the solution by neural computer. It is necessary to minimize the level of such insufficiency and to minimize the messaging traffic in the asynchronous kernel.  I.5 The Class of Problems Adequate to Neural Computers  All the problems solved by computer systems can be conditionally divided into three classes:  1. Formalized; 2. Weakly formalized; 3. Non-formalized.   I.5  ·  The Class of Problems Adequate to Neural Computers  11  The class of formalized problems consists of problems with an explicit and trans- parent solution algorithm that directly indicates the corresponding class of computers and computer architecture  SISD, SIMD, MIMD, etc.  providing the best solution.  The class of weakly formalized problems consists of problems either with a non- unique solution algorithm or with a solution algorithm that does not provide a simple estimation of the solution quality or solution accessibility. Usually the problems with large dimensionality belong to this class. These problems are characterized by so-called “dimensionality damnation” that leads to the necessity to use iteration procedures for their solution with very difficult estimation of iteration process convergence and pre- cision. The iteration procedures adequate to the weakly formalized problems are some- times used even for the formalized solutions in the case when the formal algorithm is very laborious  for example, for the solution of the linear equation system with suffi- ciently large dimensionality .  The class of non-formalized problems consists of problems with solution algorithms containing parameters or functions that are implicitly given in the form of description of some input signal class. The examples of such problems are pattern recognition problems, clusterization or self-learning, search for informative attributes, etc.  Notice that in principle, there is a relationship between the aforementioned prob- lem classes and the type of computer architecture. But this relationship cannot be directly expressed. The formalized problems characterized by an essentially consequent algo- rithm are evidently adequate to the SISD architecture. However, a lot of problems among well-formalized  ones  can  be  solved  much  more  efficiently  by  the  use  of  special parallelization methods. This class of problems represents a sufficiently large domain of the present-day mathematics related to the development of parallelization algorithms. As a rule, the development of a parallelization algorithm for the formalized problem is performed on the basis of the concrete computer architecture  SIMD, MIMD, etc. . The aforementioned weakly formalized problem can evidently be solved using a serial computer, but these problems are more adequate to computers with SIMD and MIMD architectures. Moreover, weakly formalized problems to some degree were the reason for the development of computers with such architectures.  It is possible to consider computers with SIMD and MIMD architectures as devices conditionally adequate to the formalized problems with a sufficiently parallelized so- lution algorithm and to the weakly formalized problems.  Namely non-formalized problems were the reason for the development of neural com- puters about thirty years ago, though in principle, the solutions of neural problems were performed on the basis of computers with SISD architecture, and there are attempts to solve such problems on the basis of computers with SIMD and MIMD architectures.  The following main problems must be solved in the process of neural computer  development:   cid:1  Development of the solution algorithm adequate to the neural computer structure. Selection of a kernel in the solution algorithm structure that is adequate by its struc- ture to the neural network with maximal parallelism  number of neurons in the layers, dimensionality of the attribute space ;   cid:1  Development of structures and methods for the neural network implementation  adequate to the given class of problems;   12  I  ·  Introduction   cid:1  Development of neural network adjustment algorithms in the process of solution of  given problems and analysis of their convergence;   cid:1  Development of the neural network theory sideward universalization of the neural  kernel in the enlarged class of algorithms.  The uniform neural network structure for the selection of the solution algorithm in the capacity of the architecture kernel was chosen according to the following reasons:  1. Such a structure provides the possibility of massive parallel synchronous execution of a large number of operations that in turn consist of the simplest operations of addition, multiplication and nonlinear transformations.  2. Such a structure implements sufficiently complex and flexible functional transfor-  mation of the input space into the output space.  3. Such a structure enables an analytical description of transformation of the input  space of states into the output one.  4. Such a structure enables the organization of the controlled process of the network  coefficient adjustment in the adaptive mode.  5. In  the  future,  the  use  of  the  linear  sequential  Gill  machines  will  allow  one  to come to the solution of the analytical description problem. This in turn will pro- vide the possibility of synthesizing adaptation algorithms in the multilayer neural networks [I-8].  I.6 Methods of Coefficient Readjustment  Methods of readjustment of the neural network weight coefficients in neural comput- ers can be classified in the following way:   cid:1  Technological methods  used in the stage of production  similar to those used, for  example, in the production of GaAs optical neural chips;   cid:1  Schematic design methods  used for the specified user before the exploitation stage ;  cid:1  System engineering methods  used in the process of functioning  that in turn can be conditionally classified into several subclasses, for example, low-speed methods  as during the solution of linear inequalities  and high-speed methods  as during adaptive processing of the neural network input signal .  I.7 Neural Computer Classification  According to the common opinion of designers, neural networks have a much wider field of implementation than any other implementations of parallelism concepts due to the fact that the property of a large massive parallelism in the case of neural net- works is embedded inside of them.  Figure I.5 shows a structure of the main neural computer types. This structure is presented in order to determine the main perspectives of the architectural develop- ment for large-powered computers, in particular, for neural computers.   I.7  ·  Neural Computer Classification  13  Fig. I.5. Structure of main types of neural computers  It is assumed that the neural computer capacity increases with the increase of the  type number.  Type 1. Computers of this type are represented by the well-known EC computers, CM  computers and personal computers.  Type 2. Neural computers of the simplest form in which a neural algorithm is soft- ware emulated on the basis of type-1-computers providing an equivalent ca- pacity increase in the process of problem solving.  Type 3. This type of computer includes single-processor computers  large-scale com- puters, mini computers or personal computers  equipped with array processors. Computers of DAP, IBM with FPS, STARAN, etc. -types can serve as examples. Type 4. Neural computers with hardware software emulation of neural algorithms on  the basis of type-3-computers.  Type 5. Computers of different classes, beginning with super-computers up to mul- tiple-microprocessor computers, equipped with several numbers of proces- sors  usually not more than 2, 4, 8, or 16 . Computers “Elbrus”, WARP, Alliant, etc. are the examples.  Type 6. Neural computers with software emulation of neural algorithms on the basis  of type-5-computers.  Type 7.

Computers with MSIMD architecture equipped with a sufficiently powerful trans- puter or transputer-like kernel. The increased capacity is achieved by the addi- tion of a co-processor to each kernel processor. Thus, each such co-processor represents some unit with SIMD architecture.  Type 12. This computer type is similar to the type-11-computers equipped with synchro- nously functioning clusters of processor elements implementing neural algorithms.  It is necessary to mention that computers of 4-, 8- and 12-types include a hardware  software implementation of “neural clusters”. Such an implementation is significantly oriented namely on the solution based on the neural algorithms with corresponding elemental base, architecture, and program development systems.  From our viewpoint, it is also noteworthy that at present, the computer systems of  types 9, 11, and 12 are the most perspective.  In type-11-computers, the disadvantages related to the property 1 are partially elimi- nated. And in type-12-computers, also the disadvantages related to the property 2 are eliminated.  I.8 Some Remarks Concerning the Neural Computer Elemental Base  The problem of the neural computer elemental base is the most significant one in the determination of the neural computer type that will be designed in the nearest future. Classical technology lines of elemental base elaboration oriented on the neural struc- tures must be developed along with new technology lines appropriate only to the neu- ral computers. Suggestions concerning the development of the perspective neural com- puter elemental base are formed on the basis of a wide scope of functions. A detailed analysis of the efficiency of problem solving with the use of various technologies will allow one to select in the future the preferences and top-priorities in the neural com- puter elemental base implementation.  One can consider the following neural computer elemental base as a top-priority one:   cid:1  Custom-designed transputer-like 32-bit microprocessor that will allow one to save in the future the already accumulated experience of technological design of trans- puter and transputer-like systems and to use the already developed reserve of the corresponding software;   cid:1  Cascade signal processors of IMS A100- and IMS A110-types;  cid:1  VLSIC packages and memory microassemblies with high operation speed and digi-  tal capacity of samples;   cid:1  Programmable logic IC for the neural processing element implementation.  The following neural computer elemental base can be considered as a second-priority one:   cid:1  Custom-designed digital CMOS neural chips;  cid:1  Optoelectronic GaAs neural chip;  cid:1  Analogous CMOS neural chips.   I.8  ·  Some Remarks Concerning the Neural Computer Elemental Base  15  The following neural computer elemental base can be considered as a third-priority one:   cid:1  System of neural units on the slab board;  cid:1  Neural blocks based on molecular electronics;  cid:1  Quantum neural computers.  A majority of new designs of perspective information processing facilities in Russia and abroad are associated with an obligatory decrease of the requirements of technol- ogy standards and an increase of the chip integration level. The concept of neural computers on the one hand provides the increase of the capacity-price ratio during problem solving based on the current technology standards, and on the other hand allows one to use principally new technologies  analogous, optical, charge coupled device, etc.  for the development of high-efficiency systems. We consider that this will allow one to escape difficulties related to the intention to minimize technology stan- dards in the process of digital VLSIC manufacturing.  The importance of microelectronic technologies in computer architectural devel- opment is evident. Moreover, we consider that namely technological development gives rise to new types of computer architectures. This was the case in the middle of the 1970s when the appearance of medium-scale IC gave rise to the development of com- puters with SIMD architecture. Similarly, at the beginning of the 1980s, the develop- ment of large-scale IC gave rise to the development of transputers and computers with the MIMD architecture.  Namely the development of microelectronic technologies actualized the active de- velopment of neural computers in the second half of the 1980s. A transputer could objectively be designed only after the 32-bit micro-processor, on-chip memory, and channel adapters could be manufactured in a single chip. Similarly, the active develop- ment of neural computers started after the hardware implementation of a cascaded segment of the neural network with adjusted or fixed coefficients became possible in a single chip.  It is important to notice that in the case of the neural technology representation of the solution algorithms, one can avoid an abnormal  from our viewpoint  intention towards the “distilment” directed at the submicron technology. Such a trend was char- acteristic for the computer systems based on the processors of i860, Power PC, Alpha, Mersed, etc. types. The aforementioned intention towards the “distilment” of the sub- micron technology usually results in the following:   cid:1  Short-term, local, and often illusive results in the development of domestic compu-  tation facilities based on the use of imported micro-processors;   cid:1  Practically zero contribution to the development of domestic microelectronics that  constitutes the basis of the future domestic computer science.  Neural computer designs will be efficient by their capacity-price ratio even with the use of available Russian 1.0-micron technology. Such designs will provide a higher- priority development of domestic giant-powered computers.  Design engineers developing a line of highly parallel computers with an increased node  capacity  must  remember  that  the  speed  of  the  information  propagation  in   16  I  ·  Introduction  the  human  brain  is  very  low.  Therefore,  one  must  think  about  the  development  of perspective  highly  parallel  solution  algorithms  and  architectures,  including  neural ones, rather than about the operation frequency of the node element. It is also neces- sary  to  remember  that  mankind  achieved  a  certain  limit  that  makes  it  possible to create an engineering system consisting of 3–4 billions of neurons  as in the hu- man brain . However, nobody knows how to organize the system of connections be- tween them.  Neural chip development is one of the main lines in neural computer design. The neural chip structure corresponds to the results of structure and adjustment algorithm development  of  multilayer  neural  networks   in  the  case  of  commonly  used  neural computers  and neural network solution algorithms  in the case of problem-oriented and special-purpose neural computers .  However, the development of this technology line will require some period of time during which, for some objects, it will be cost-effective to emulate the neural network solution algorithm on the basis of large-powered computers.  It is necessary to mention a low efficiency of workstation-type single-processor computer applications for the solution of complex problems in the neural network logical basis.  It must be mentioned in addition that in order to emulate neural network algo- rithms with the use of universal microprocessor facilities, it is more effective to de- velop architectures oriented on the neural network operation execution than to use standard algorithms oriented on the modification of a single-processor solution.  We consider the following classes of computer facilities:   cid:1  Single-processor computers  personal computers, middle-class computers, etc. ;  cid:1  Small-processor computers;  cid:1  Multi-processor  computers   computers  with  massive  parallelization,  transputer computers, psuedo-transputer computers, computers with transputer kernel and peripheral processors of i860-, Alpha-, Power PC-, etc. types ;   cid:1  Neural computers.  computers.  The priority of Russian computer science belongs to the development of neural  On the modern stage of the development  of microelectronic technology and ad- joining technologies, neural network technology became adequate not only for the different types of microelectronic and semiconductor technologies but also for optical, optoelectronic, molecular, quantum and other technologies.  It must be mentioned that the appearance of slab board system technology and nanotechnology will result in the development of some new super-parallel architec- tures. It is clear at present that the neural network architecture technology is adequate to the slab board technology  American and Japanese engineering designs . That is why the attempts to develop functional blocks with old architecture on the level of nano-elements adequate to the single-processor computers can be regarded as dead- end. Starting from nano-neural elements, one can probably achieve principally new architecture elements. It is clear that it will be the elements of super-parallel and large- powered computers.

Such technologies must include specially designed software that not only provides fast and high-grade quality input of real images of neural tissue cuts but also allows one to perform the in-line processing of these images.  At present, the neural computer designers are not limited by the properties of real specific neural structures because of their relative simplicity or simplicity of considered problems. The increase in requirements imposed by the used neural structures will cause the development of a neuro-physiology line for their investigation. First of all, this will take place in the domain of different vision and acoustic sensor information processing. Each new technology gives birth to a new class of architectures of computing facili- ties. This was the case with SIMD architecture at the end of the 1970s and at the begin- ning of the 1980s. The same situation was with MIMD architecture at the beginning and at the end of the 1980s. Nowadays it occurs with neurocomputers.  The performance of investigations of real neural network structures aimed at the development of neurocomputers and molecular computers will result in the appear- ance of original architecture prototypes, because the technological principles of real- izing and evolution of biological and molecular neural networks greatly differ from those used at present when realizing VLSI and optical neural networks.  I.9 Neural Mathematics – Methods and Algorithms of Problem Solving Using Neurocomputers  The following question is always actual: what class of problems appears to be most adequate to various computer devices based on some new principles? It was consid- ered for a long time that neurocomputers are efficient at the solution of so-called non- formalized problems or weakly formalized problems. Such problems usually relate to the class of problems that require the inclusion of a learning process based on the real experimental data into the solution algorithm.  At present, this class of problems also includes a second class of problems that does not require the process of learning based on the experimental data. However, this sec- ond problem class can be well represented in the neural network logical basis. This problem class is characterized first of all by its pronounced natural parallelization properties in the performance of   cid:1  Signal processing;  cid:1  Pattern processing, etc.  The use of neural network algorithms will also be efficient in the solution of prob- lems in which the dimensionality of the input information space can be efficiently formed by the use of the Monte Carlo method rather than by the use of standard ana- lytic methods.  We  consider  that  any  problem  can  be  solved  with  the  help  of  a  neurocomputer much more effectively than with a standard computer due to the fact that any problem   18  I  ·  Introduction  algorithm can be represented in the neural network logical basis with the controlled neural  layers  number  [I-9].  This  means  that  the  neural  network  algorithm  for  the solution  of  any  problem  on  the  logical  level  is  much  more  parallel  than  any  of  its physical implementation. Notice that in the case of transputer and pseudo-transputer systems, the solution algorithm that is initially less parallel than the physical imple- mentation starts to adapt to a more parallel physical implementation. This property principally differentiates neural computers from such systems as transputer ones or systems with transputer kernel and peripheral processors of i860-type, Alpha-type, Power PC-type, etc. All latter systems are usually characterized by modified algorithms taken initially from single-processor computers in which their designers try to mini- mize  the  expenses  related  to  the  information  exchange  between  processors  in  the solution process.  The argument in favor of the viewpoint that neural computers will be more efficient than any other architecture is the great enlargement of the problem class solved at present in the neural network logical basis. In addition to the aforementioned prob- lems, one can also mention   cid:1  Solution of linear and nonlinear algebraic equations of high dimensionality;  cid:1  Solution of systems of nonlinear differential equations;  cid:1  Solution of partial derivative equations;  cid:1  Expert systems;  cid:1  Solution of optimization problems  linear and nonlinear programming  and other  problems.  The transfer to the neural network logical basis in all these problems is usually performed when the dimensionality of the space solution sharply increases or when it is necessary to significantly decrease the solution time.  In general, two sections of neural mathematics are developed: general neural math-  ematics and applied neural mathematics.  Neural mathematics is one of the fields of computational mathematics in which solutions are performed with the use of algorithms in the neural network logical basis. The main goal of neural mathematic development is to elaborate algorithms with a high degree of parallelism for formalized problems as well as for weakly formalized and non-formalized ones.  A criterion of neural network algorithm efficiency is a decrease in the time required for the solution as compared with traditional methods. The comparison of algorithm efficiency in different neural computer implementations is a separate problem that requires a special investigation.  We shall call a neural network algorithm such a computational procedure; the main part of which can be implemented with the help of a neural network. Let us consider P to be a formal problem statement. P includes a set of initial data D and a set of objects R that must be determined. A basis for the neural network algorithm development is a systematic approach in which the problem solving process is represented in the form of some dynamic system functioning in time. Thus, the system input is the data set D, and its output is the set of objects R. The objects of the set R are determined and got their values after the problem solving process.   I.9  ·  Neural Mathematics – Methods and Algorithms of Problem Solving Using Neurocomputers  19  The development of the neural network dynamic system that solves the posed prob-  lem consists of the following stages:  1. Determination of an object that represents an input signal of the neural network. It can be some element of the initial data, some initial value of the determined param- eters, etc.;  2. Determination of an object that represents an output signal of the neural network.  It can be a solution itself or some of its characteristics;  3. Determination of a desired output neural network signal; 4. Determination of the neural network structure:  a Number of layers; b Connections between layers; c Objects representing weighting coefficients.  5. Determination  of  system  error  function,  i.e.,  a  function  that  characterizes  a deviation  of  the  desired  neural  network  output  signal  from  the  real  output signal;  6. Determination of a system quality criterion and functional of its optimization, that  depends on the error;  7. Determination of weighting coefficient values. This can be done in different ways  according to the considered problem: a Analytically, directly being based on the problem statement; b On the basis of some computational methods; c Using a procedure of neural network coefficient adjustment.  A solution with the help of a neural network algorithm consists of the use of a designed  computer  procedure  based  on  some  concrete  numerical  data  values.  The solution process includes the following stages:  1. Determination of a specified neural network structure corresponding to the used  algorithm;  2. Determination of weighting coefficient values or their direct selection from memory  in the case when these coefficients were previously found;  3. Generation of initial parameter approximations, if it is necessary; 4. Transmission of all numerical values to the neural network and activation of this  neural network;  5. Neural network functioning according to the following selected modes:  a A single step mode or a mode with several fixed numbers of steps; b A mode with a variable number of steps depending upon the required precision and or upon the specified numerical values of parameters. In this case, the input signal adjustment process takes place;  6. Obtaining the solution.  In the case of multiple usage of the aforementioned procedures, points  1  and  2   can be performed only once.  We shall call a neural computer such a computational system that possesses an ar-  chitecture providing the aforementioned steps 1–6.   20  I  ·  Introduction  Neural mathematics represents a new field of computational mathematics that is oriented on the design of algorithms for the solution of a wide class of problems with the use of neurocomputers. The suggested approach for the algorithm design includes both well-known computational methods, as well as knowledge already accumulated in the domain of neural network calculations. However, this approach significantly differs from both the first and second methods.  Traditional numerical methods are used in neural mathematics only in the case when these methods can be effectively parallelized and expressed in terms of neural network operations. However, these methods can be sufficiently overworked.  Practically all known approaches for the neural network design relate in general to the selection and analysis of some particular structure forms with known properties  Hopfield, Grossberg or Kohonen networks  or to the analysis of some specific modes of their functioning. The use of neural networks is reduced to the application of these structures for the solution of adequate problems in the case of some modifications of their structural parameters.  The initial point in neural mathematics is the problem statement. This problem statement determines the neural network structure adequate to this problem. If it is necessary to perform some adjustment, then one uses the properties of neural network structure classes that include the obtained structure.  The class of neural network structures is usually sufficiently generalized  multi-  layer neural networks with sequential cross and backward connections .  As a rule, a neural computer must be oriented towards the fast performance of neural network operations and towards parallelized algorithms of the neural network adjust- ment.  The development of the neural computer includes the following three parallel lines:  1. Development of the solution algorithms  neural mathematics ; 2. Development of the neural network theory, structure classes and methods of their  adjustment;  3. Development  of  the  neural  computer  as  an  assembly  of  hardware  and  software  orientated towards the solution of neural mathematic problems.  All these levels of development are connected to each other. On the one hand, the neural network structure for each problem is determined by the problem itself. On the other hand, the development of the neural network theory results in the use of more and more complex neural network structures. On the one hand, the level of the used hardware determines the level of possibilities for neural network and algorithm development. On the other hand, the development of neural mathematics determines the develop- ment of neural network theory that in turn develops the hardware implementation. At present, the line of neural network investigation depends on the line of neural computer development only in the field of software implementation of specific prob- lems and their structures. In the future, both neural computer software and hardware will be determined by the solved problems and by the neural network implementation. The solution with the help of a neural network computer depends on the adjust- ment procedure that requires the choice of initial parameter values, the choice of an iteration method step value, etc.   I.10  ·  About Neural Networks  21  Due to the fact that not all these processes are well formalized and depend on the  field of the problem application, they are usually human-aided.  Two of the following types of dialogue are observed in the procedure of the solution:  1. A dialogue during the process of neural computer preparation for the solution of a specific problem with foregone limitations on the initial data and on the results. The main part of such a dialogue consists in the adjustment of weight coefficients. After the adjustment procedure, the problem can be solved many times with different initial data and one and the same set of problem parameters and neural network structure. In the case when the weight coefficient adjustment procedure is absent, this type of dialogue is reduced to the selection of the required values out of the neural computer memory.  2. A dialogue during the process of solution. It includes the generation of initial value parameters. However, the most labor-consuming part is the dialogue during the process of the input signal tuning. In this stage, a designer can analyze the dynamics of the system quality functional changes and select the step value in the adjustment method.  Such a dialogue is critical for the solution process. That is why in the tasks where the solution time minimization is the most important criterion for the efficiency of the neural network algorithms, this type of dialogue must be minimized by means of its shortening or automation. It can also be completely excluded by means of complete automation of the step value selection or by means of the algorithm complication. In the case when it cannot be done, one can try to design the algorithm without the input signal tuning and with the help of a weighting coefficient adjustment.  I.10 About Neural Networks  A neural network represents a highly parallelized dynamic system with a directed graph topology that can receive the output information by means of a reaction of its state on the input actions. Processor elements and directed channels are called  nodes  of the neural network.  Neural networks at the bottom represent a formal tool for the description of the main part of the solution algorithm based on the neural network. The frame of the present book, as well as the book [I-6], is a system approach to the neural network synthesis, i.e., an approach to the design of the neural networks themselves and adap- tation algorithms similar to the classic adaptive control systems.  We consider that four approaches to the neural network investigation are possible:  1. Psychological approach, when it is necessary to model some psychological paradigm that requires a development and investigation of the neural network with some definite structure.  2. Neurophysiological approach, when the neural network is developed and investi- gated on the basis of the knowledge about the structure of some brain part. The neural network models functions of this brain part.   22  I  ·  Introduction  3. Algorithmic  approach, when  some  mathematical  problem  is  formulated  and  an adequate neural network with the corresponding algorithm adjusted to this solu- tion is designed on the basis of this formulation.  4. Systematic approach that combines all the aforementioned approaches and repre- sents the frame of this book. Figure I.6 shows the general structure of the neural network synthesis basically described in the present study.  Fig. I.6. System approach – the multilayer neural network synthesis   I.10  ·  About Neural Networks  23  I.10.1 Neural Network Structures  The automata theory and the theory of Boolean elements in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s formed the basis for the development of architecture and separate units of single-pro- cessor computers. The same theory of automata based on Boolean elements continues to serve as the logical basis for small-processor, transputer and similar computers, as well as for computers with SIMD architecture in which a network of single-bit proces- sors  STARAN, etc.  represents a peripheral processor.  Similarly, the neural network theory is the logical basis for neural computers. And this has already been the case for several decades  1950s, 1960s and 1970s . At present, this fact has become more evident due to the revolutionary development of the neural computer field.  The neural network represents a network with a finite number of layers consisting of solitary elements that are similar to neurons with different types of connections between layers. The number of neurons in the layers is selected to be sufficient for the provision of the required problem solving quality. The number of layers is desired to be minimal in order to decrease the problem solving time.  This book is dedicated to the description of neural networks with different struc- tures. The objective conditions for the transfer from Boolean to the threshold basis in computer engineering are given. The main types of the threshold elements such as neuron analogues are described. The reasons for investigations of multilayer neural networks are analyzed. The interest in such networks appeared in the 1960s after the publication of the classical work by Rosenblatt [I-1]. Multilayered features are consid- ered specific properties of transformation structure performed by the open-loop sys- tem at its topological but not symbolic representation.  Rosenblatt [I-1] investigated multilayer systems with layers consisting of elements with a peer-to-peer topological relationship between the elements of other layers. The layers form sensor elements that represent signal sources for the associative elements of the three-layer perceptron. Associative elements also form a layer of elements whose input consists of the output signals of the sensor elements of the next layer. A multi- layer system is a system of elements combined into separate layers with topologically equal properties and different characteristics of connections between the layers of elements. Different types of multilayer neural networks are considered. They include neural networks with sequential connections, cross-connections and backward con- nection, as well as continual neural networks. Some special types of neural networks are suggested by different authors.  The following main advantages of neural networks as a logical basis for the complex  solution algorithms can be mentioned:   cid:1  Invariance of neural network synthesis methods upon the dimensionality of the  space of features;   cid:1  Adequacy of the modern perspective technologies;  cid:1  Fault-tolerance in the sense of monotonic but not catastrophic change of the prob-  lem solving quality depending on the number of failing elements.   24  I  ·  Introduction  The main goal of this section is to explain why the system aimed at the solution of some specific problem must be designed namely in the form of the neural network and how to choose this neural network topology  the number of layers, the number of layer elements, connections characteristics, topology .  I.10.2 Investigation of Neural Network Input Signal Characteristics  In the first chapter of [I-6], at the investigation of the neural network input signal characteristics in the case of the widely spread task of pattern recognition, a notion of teacher  supervisor  qualification for the input signal distribution functions is intro- duced. These functions include, in particular, the well-known modes of learning and self-learning. In the general case, the teacher qualification is introduced in different ways for different patterns belonging to objectively different classes. The possibility of introducing more specific input signal characteristics is shown. For example, “teacher’s slant about his capabilities” is introduced.  A formal problem statement about neural network learning consists in the approxima- tion of a given sample function of the teacher’s instructions by some automatic machine with given properties. A formal problem statement about self-learning is considered a selection in the input signal space of some areas of pattern distribution function modes at the input. A formal problem statement about supervised neural network learning with the teacher of a limited qualifications is a generalization of the first two statements.  The existent investigations in the field of pattern recognition relate mainly to the stationary patterns. In this case, the neural network input signal distribution is time- independent. The present book deals with non-stationary patterns with time-depen- dent neural network input signal distribution.  I.10.3 About the Selection of Criteria for Primary Neural Network Optimization  A class of statistical theory criteria is usually considered criteria for primary multilayer neural network optimization in the mode of pattern recognition learning. The examples of such criteria are a criterion with a minimum of the average risk function under the condition of equality between the average risk function components for patterns of dif- ferent classes and a criterion with a minimum of the average risk function under the condition of a given value of the average risk function component for one of the classes. A  precondition  for  the  formation  of  the  criterion  and  functional  for  the  neural network primary optimization in the learning mode is a representation of the input signal distribution density in the form of a multi-modal function. In this case, some class corresponds to each mode with some probability. Modifications of the average risk function are used at the initial investigation stage as criteria for the primary neu- ral network optimization in the self-learning mode. This criterion requires a natural generalization at the transfer to the continuum of classes and solutions. A separate question considered in the book is the problem of the primary optimization functional formation in the case of arbitrary teacher qualification.   I.10  ·  About Neural Networks  25  I.10.4 Analysis of Open-Loop Neural Networks  A  formal  technique  used  in  the  analysis  of  the  open-loop  systems  is  based  on  the precise methods of probability analysis of multidimensional nonlinear systems. The transformation mainly to the analysis of distributions and moments of distribution of errors is related to the fact that the results of such analysis are formally indepen- dent of the neural network complexity and type. The exclusion is only characteristic of the feature space and solution space. Further, the latter significant observation is widely used in the stages of selection or the secondary optimization functional for- mation, as well as during closed-loop neural network development.  The secondary optimization functional is a functional expressed through the pa- rameters of the current signal distributions in the neural networks. It is directly mini- mized in the multilayer neural networks at the closed-cycle adjustment. At this synthe- sis stage, mainly two problems are considered.  The first problem concerns the investigation of correspondence between the sec- ondary optimization functionals used in some known works and some criteria of the primary optimization. A matter at issue here is the known adaptive system, such as Adalin, Stainbuh matrix, or Rosenblatt’s three-layer perceptron  or rather its adjust- able output unit . It is mentioned that the main disadvantage of such approaches is the absence of analysis of correspondence between the used secondary optimization functionals and specific criteria of the primary optimization. This results in the prac- tically complete absence of the operation capability of some systems under the con- dition of multi-modal distributions of the input signal.  The second problem concerns the formation of the secondary optimization func- tional corresponding to the given primary optimization criterion. A correspondence in this case is considered in the sense of the coincidence of neural network parameters under the minimum of primary and secondary optimization functionals. The book describes a general method for forming the secondary optimization functional corre- sponding to the given primary optimization criterion. The results of applying such a method for multilayer neural networks of different structures and for different pri- mary criteria are shown.  I.10.5 Algorithms for a Multivariable Functional Extremum Search and Design of Adaptation Algorithms in Neural Networks  Algorithms for a multivariable functional extremum search and their use for the de- sign of adaptation algorithms in neural networks are described in the sixth and sev- enth chapters of [I-6].  The problem of a secondary optimization functional extremum search procedure is widely discussed in the literature. We shall mainly consider the aspects of possi- bility  and  purposefulness  of  the  use  of  various  gradient  procedures   newtonian, relaxation,  steepest  descent,  stochastic  approximation,  etc.   for  the  search  of  local extremum.   26  I  ·  Introduction  The use of iteration methods for the design of multivariable functional extremum search  algorithms  has  some  peculiarities  at  the  development  of  adaptive  systems [I-10]. These peculiarities mainly relate to the fact that under the unknown charac- teristics  of  the  input  signal  and  under  the  conditions  of so-called  a  priori  insuffi- ciency, one cannot say anything about the form of the secondary optimization func- tional even when the neural network structure is fixed. It is only possible to say about such a property of this functional that it has several local extrema, and all of them, or at least some of them, must be found in the process of closed-cycle adjustment. Namely  this  fact  requires  the  necessity  to  introduce  some  elements  of  a  random nature into the search procedure aimed at the selection of the set of random initial conditions  for  some  gradient  procedure.  Hence,  the  main  problem  is  to  find  the probability  of revealing  some  number  of  secondary  optimization  functional  local extremums with dependence on the number of emissions of random initial condi- tions for the gradient procedure of the local extremum search. One of the problems that must be solved in the stage of the closed system design consists in the estimation of the secondary optimization functional gradient vector in the neural networks. This can be done in two ways:  1. Introduction of search oscillations and detection; 2. Representation of gradient vector estimation in the form of expression through the  signals in neural networks  output and intermediate signals .  In the first case, one  deals  with  the adaptive search  system. In the second case, one  deals  with  the  analytical  system.  It  is  evident  that  the  design  of  neural  net- works  in  the  form  of  analytical  systems  adjusted  in  the  closed  cycle  is  prefer- able  because  the  introduction  of  search  oscillations  adds  noise  to  the  system. However, the design of closed-loop neural networks using analytical methods is not always possible. The limitations of the analytical approach are shown in the present book  while  describing  the  stage  of  closed-loop  neural  network  design.  The  main attention  in  the  stage  of  closed-loop  neural  network  design  is  paid  to  the  imple- mentation of given primary optimization criteria in the neural networks of different structures.  An important problem is the development of the neural network adjustment algo- rithms in the self-learning mode and arbitrary teacher qualification mode. The meth- ods of closed-loop system design here are the same as in the learning mode. This is the main idea of the universal approach to the processes of learning and self-learning that constitutes the basis for multilayer neural network synthesis described in [I-6] and in the present study.  The analysis of the known heuristic algorithms for the neural network adjustment based  on  the  idea  of  a  universal  approach  to  the  adaptation  algorithms  synthesis in the neural networks is represented in the work [I-6]. The material concerning ad- aptation algorithms in continuum neural networks and the selection of adaptation algorithms that are adequate to their physical implementation is also represented in this work.  The peculiarities of the initial condition selection in the neural network adaptation  algorithms are also considered.   I.10  ·  About Neural Networks  27  I.10.6 Investigation of Neural Network Adaptation Algorithms  Investigation  of  closed-loop  neural  networks  is  the  final  stage  of  investigation  of multilayer neural networks with fixed structure and with closed-cycle adjustment. This synthesis stage deals with some problems related to the open-loop multilayer neural network’s performance quality estimation.  The first of these problems is the problem of selection of initial conditions for the adjustment of multilayer neural network coefficients. As it is mentioned above, the secondary optimization functional possesses multiple-extremum properties. This is the reason why two methods of initial condition selection are usually considered: a random method when all local and global extrema must be found and a deterministic method when the multilayer neural network is introduced into the domain of the glo- bal secondary optimization functional.  The second of these problems is the problem of selecting a class of multilayer neural network typical input signals that is sufficiently complete to provide the possibility to estimate in the future the neural network’s performance quality. In the case of automa- tion control systems, this problem is already solved. In particular, it is solved by the selection of a polynomial input signal class as a typical one. The signal complexity in this case is determined by the polynominal order. In the case of multilayer neural networks, the input signal complexity is determined, in particular, by the modality of conditional distribution of input signals in the task of pattern recognition.  The third of these problems is the problem of selecting optimal parameters for the multilayer neural network tuning circuit. In particular, it is necessary to select a para- metric matrix of the system of secondary optimization functional extremum search. Special  attention  here  is  paid  to  the  selection  of  optimal  parameters  of  the  neural network tuning circuit based on the estimation of the primary optimization functional value. The results of investigations of a large number of multilayer neural networks obtained by means of computer modeling are presented in the studies [I-1, I-6].  In general, one must take into account the following aspects concerning this mul- tilayer neural network synthesis stage. The consideration of a non-formal problem class of pattern recognition under the unknown and sufficiently complex functions of dis- tribution densities causes difficulties not only for the process of development of such systems, but also for the attempts to estimate theoretically the quality of the solution of  these  problems.  That  is  why  the  investigators  mainly  use  methods  of  statistical modeling. The following results are already published: the results of statistical model- ing for separate neurons under the multi-modal distribution of input signals, investi- gations of adjustment dynamics of three-layer neural networks with sequential con- nections, and investigations of adjustment dynamics for multilayer neural networks at the non-stationary input signals in self-learning modes and in the supervisor learning mode when the teacher has a finite qualification.  A concrete neural network representing an array of processors with specified con- nections and implementing adaptation algorithms is a dynamic system which is de- scribed by some system of differential or difference equations [I-8, I-11]. A represen- tation of neural networks with closed-loop adaptation circuits in the form of a linear sequential machine makes it possible to describe its functioning in terms of classical   28  I  ·  Introduction  z-transformation. This allows one to use classical methods of statistical dynamics of continuous and discrete automated control systems. This is practically a single effi- cient way to analyze quantitatively the dynamics of processor array functioning dur- ing problem solving. And this way is provided namely by the neural computer’s con- cept. This way makes it possible in the future to analyze and synthesize structures of distributed computers in the form of a processor array from the neural computer class.  I.10.7 Multilayer Neural Networks with Flexible Structure  It has been aforementioned that multilayer neural networks with fixed structure and closed-cycle-adjustment provide the optimization functional optimum under the con- ditional distribution densities for the probability of the arbitrary input signal that is unknown beforehand. However, the potential quality of such neural networks is lim- ited by the a priori information concerning the structure of the open-loop system. The synthesis methods for neural networks consisting of the open-loop structure part that cannot be fixed a priori and, along with the adjustment coefficients values, represents a result of the adjustment process are considered in the nineth chapter of [I-6] and in the present study. The number of layers and the number of neurons in one layer are determined in the adjustment process. This book also considers some variants of the design of neural networks with flexible structure. The peculiarities of investigation of adjustment procedure dynamics on the level of analysis of optimization functional dependence upon the number of layers and the number of neurons in one layer are described. As a result, the neural network with flexible structure is implemented in the form of the uniform multilayer neural network.  I.10.8 Informative Feature Selection in Multilayer Neural Networks  An attempt to analyze from one viewpoint very different and rather numerous works de- dicated to the informative feature selection was done in [I-6]. It was an attempt to develop so-called structural methods related to the methods of multilayer neural network synthesis. The author considers that the widely spread viewpoint about a possibility of a so- called preliminary feature selection is not valid. The reason is that in the case of any selection features procedure, either directly or indirectly, one must use some concrete neural network. That is why any selection features procedure is subjective. And the subject is the neural network of a specific type.  The second author’s proposition in favor of the suggested approach consists in the “absoluteness” of the primary optimization functional in the capacity of the index of features information value. This is the reason that the estimations based on divergence, averaged conditional entropy, etc., are rough and particular.  The aforementioned notions suggest the  necessity to analyze the problem of an informative feature selection after the completion of synthesis procedures and after the investigation of the neural network’s dynamics. According to the author’s opinion, the multilayer neural networks with fixed and flexible structures possess the lowest degree of subjectivity with respect to the input signal  that represents the subject of   I.10  ·  About Neural Networks  29  investigations with the help of neural networks . The reason is that these neural net- works are synthesized under the condition that any information about conditional distribution densities for patterns inside classes is absent. That is why the usual ap- proach is to use the multilayer neural network for the search of maximally informative features of the initial feature space.  The use and investigation of multilayer neural networks allows one to formulate a problem of selection of the most informative features of intermediate spaces, but not of the initial feature space. These intermediate spaces are formed by the output signals of neurons of the first, second and other output layers of the neural network. This problem can be considered the problem of structure minimization  minimization of the neuron number in each layer  for the multilayer neural network after its adjust- ment coefficient procedure is finished.  I.10.9 Investigation of Neural Network Reliability  The problem of the neural network reliability is at present in the most initial stage of its development. It is evident that its solution will cause a revolutionary influence upon the problem of neural computer implementation on the basis of principally new technolo- gies. In particular, it can be a technology of the slab board system design. The property of the perceptron structure to preserve its functional capability under the breakdown of some number of its elements has been already reported by Rosenblatt in the example of the three-layer perceptron [I-1]. Modern computers do not possess this property because of the absence of explicit reservation. Computers with MIMD  Multiple Instructions – Multiple Data  architecture seem to be the only exclusion. These computers are charac- terized by the asynchronous principle of the processor’s array functioning. This provides so-called gradual system degradation when some of its elements are broken down. The similar property exists in neural computers, too. And this is their great advantage. Meth- ods for neural network functional reliability investigations are represented below. In par- ticular, we describe some experimental methods for functional reliability investigations. In addition, we also describe some methods of parametrical and functional reliability when catastrophic breakdowns occur. Some methods of the development and investiga- tion of restoring organs based on the neural networks are considered separately.  I.10.10 Neural Network Diagnostics  The neural computer’s structure is specific to the class of computers designed in the form of a processor array. This asserts some special requirements for the diagnostic procedure in those parts of the neural computer that represent a neural network. The basis for such diagnostic methods was developed in the works [I-12, I-13]. This book describes some methods of forming the notion of neural network failure, some algo- rithms of neural network failure localizations, methods of minimum test design, and methods of adaptive diagnostics of neural network failures. In principle, the described methods can serve as the basis of development of the neural computer’s operation systems for neural network testing.   30  I  ·  Introduction  I.11 Conclusions  As a result of works published in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, a line of investigations in the domain of neural network theory that appeared to be prior to the foreign investi- gations was formed.  The following methods of adaptive neural network adjustment were developed:   cid:1  With arbitrary neuron form;  cid:1  With arbitrary number of layers;  cid:1  With different connections between layers  direct, cross and backward connections ;  cid:1  With different forms of optimization criteria;  cid:1  With different limitations on the neural network weighting coefficients.  The author’s basic position in the present study is not the use of the neural network of some given structure that is preferable to some investigator, but the search for the neural network structure and the search for its methods of adjustment adequate to the solved problem.  The content of the book represents the author’s current results in the field of neural network investigations. The main line is the development of the neural network theory. In general, neural computers represent a prospective line of the modern giant-pow- ered computer’s development. The neural network theory and neural mathematics represent a foreground line of development of Russian computer science, and they require a support. The bases for the development of these lines are the applied com- puter systems consisting of neural computers that must be designed in the nearest future.  Development of the following three lines: solutions of neural network algorithms,  theory of neural networks and neural computers are tightly interrelated:   cid:1  On the one hand, the neural network structure for each task is determined by this task itself, while on the other hand, the neural network theory development pro- vokes the use of more complex structures of neural networks;   cid:1  On the one hand, the technology level determines possibilities of neural network and neural network algorithm design, while on the other hand, the development of neural mathematics stimulates the neural network theory; that in turn determines the development of technology;   cid:1  At present, the line of neural network investigations is interrelated with the line of the neural computer’s development only in the domain of software implementation of the solution of different problems and corresponding structures. In the future, both hardware as well as software components of the neural computer will be mainly determined by solved problems and by neural network structures.  Neural computers represent an efficient symbiosis of computer science, adaptive  system automated control theory, and neurodynamics.

We represent below the main reasons determining the transfer from the logical basis of Boolean elements to the threshold logical basis. The main threshold elements are described as well as their relationship with multiple-meaning and continuous logic. The  main  neural  network  types  proposed  by  different  authors  in  the  1960s   by Rosenblatt, Widrow, etc.  and at present are described. Materials related to continual neural networks  continuum of features, neurons, etc.  are also presented. We will also separately consider some objective reasons for introducing cross connections in mul- tilayer neural networks, as well as a formal description of methods of such neural networks.   Chapter 1  Transfer from the Logical Basis of Boolean Elements “AND, OR, NOT” to the Threshold Logical Basis  A fundamental point for the neural computer’s appearance is the refusal of a Boolean logical basis on the level of computer elements and the transfer to the threshold logical basis. The latter one models some functions of the nerve cell. This transfer changes not only the computer element basis but also all of the computer’s architecture.  1.1 Linear Threshold Element  Neuron   The works concerning threshold logic appeared in the 1960s and 1970s [1-1 to 1-8]. They propose the use of neurons for the design of separate computer units. Here, these neurons perform the following logical transformation of input signals into output ones:  This is the simplest interpretation of the neuron transfer function. Here, y is a neu- ron output; ai are weighting coefficients; a0 is a threshold; xi are the neuron input val- ∈ {0,1} ; and N is a dimensionality of the neuron input signal. The neuron non- ues  xi linear transformation in this case is the following:   1.1    1.2   Figure 1.1 shows a functional block diagram of a neuron. In this particular case, when ai = 1  i = 1, …, n , the neuron represents a majority element, and the threshold is equal to a0 = N   2.  A threshold function in the expression for the transfer function  1.1  can take any arbitrary value but is not only determined by expression  1.2 . This changes coefficients a0 and ai. As a rule, one uses the form  1.2  of the threshold function or the following form:  The choice depends upon physical implementation of this function either in ana-  logue or digital form.   36  Chapter 1  ·  Transfer from the Logical Basis of Boolean Elements “AND, OR, NOT”  Fig. 1.1. Functional block diagram of a neuron  The following advantages of a neuron with respect to the Boolean elements AND,  OR, NOT, etc., can be mentioned:  1. A neuron performs more complex logical functions. This provides the implemen- tation of a given logical function with the help of a smaller number of elements. As a result, one obtains the possibility to decrease the equipment size during computer unit construction;  2. Neural networks possess a high tolerance against the failure of separate elements. It was mentioned in [I-1] that in the three-layer perceptron, the failure of several numbers of neurons of the first layer with arbitrary connections did not result in the sharp catastrophic decrease of the problem solving quality even in the absence of special diagnostic procedures and structure reconfiguration. Such an ability at present is observed only in multi-microprocessor computers with extended paral- lelism and SIMD  Single Instruction – Multiple Data  and MIMD  Multiple Instruc- tions – Multiple Data  architectures when diagnostics procedures and reconfigura- tion are implemented on these structures;  One of the properties of such structures is the property of so-called permanent degra- dation. Accordingly, the main quality of system performance  the probability of correct recognition and efficiency  is maximal when all the elements are properly functioning, and this quality decreases when the element failure occurs, but not catastrophically; 3. Neural networks possess an increased tolerance against variation of their circuit parameters. This property can be illustrated by a simple logical function of two variables implemented with the help of a neuron  Fig. 1.2 . Rather large variances of weighting coefficients and threshold value do not result in the error of this given logical function implementation.  4. Implementation in the form of VLSI or optical devices with algorithms adequate to neural networks is performed in an analogous form. This form possesses much more operation speed as compared to the digital implementation.  Maximal information parallelization is achieved when hardware neural network implementation of sufficiently “large” mathematical operations of high dimensio- nality is realized.   Fig. 1.2. Neuron tolerance against varia- tion of weighting coefficients and threshold value  1.2  ·  Multi-Threshold Logics  37  5. Neural networks can be formally described as dynamic discrete systems with the use of the linear sequential machine technique. This provides the possibility not only to analyze the behavior of such systems by means of control theory methods, but also to synthesize neural network structures according to the given criteria.  6. It is possible to minimize the VLSI type in the case of uniform neural network design. This allows one to follow up the tendency of simplification of VLSI computer-aided design systems. The relative independency of logical neural VLSI algorithm design upon dimensionality of input and output space forms a basis for standardization of this procedure in a wider class of functional circuits implemented by neural networks.  1.2 Multi-Threshold Logics  Multi-threshold logics can be regarded as the generalization of threshold logics. The logical completeness of a multi-threshold element  MTE  that represents a functional cell of some logical device based on multi-threshold logics is connected with the ex- istence of a group of thresholds implemented by this MTE. We shall consider MTE as an element functioning according to the equation   1.3   given in [1-6]. The MTE block scheme is shown in Fig. 1.3.  Methods of MTE network synthesis were analyzed during several years [1-7, 1-9, 1-10]. But they did not lead to sufficient results. The most perspective methods for MTE net- works development are adaptive methods [I-6, I-10]. These methods are characterized by a weak dependence upon the input space dimensionality and the network complexity.   38  Chapter 1  ·  Transfer from the Logical Basis of Boolean Elements “AND, OR, NOT”  Fig. 1.3. A block scheme of MTE  Fig. 1.4. A block-scheme of a neuron with continuum solutions  1.3 Continuous Logic  This field of science is a natural development of double-digit logic through  K-digit logic. It has an important significance for the development of neural network com- puter theory that considers analogous implementation requiring high operation speed. Continuous neural logic includes circuits that allow one to perform logical operations with continuous variables [1-11 to 1-13]. Figure 1.4 shows a general structure of a neuron with a solution continuum that represents a basis of continuous neural logic circuit de- sign. The behavior of function f  that is called an activation function  is considered below according to the neuron model representation or according to the class of solved prob- lems and to the possibility of designing the adaptation algorithm in the most optimal way.  The transformation performed by the circuit shown in Fig. 1.4 has the form  The function F g  is a continuous differentiable and steadily increasing function. It forms a continuous output signal of the neural network element. In this case, the no- tion of a separating surface implemented by the network in the initial feature space degenerates. The parameters of F g  function can be fixed or adjustable.   1.4  ·  Particular Forms of Activation Function  39  1.4 Particular Forms of Activation Function  One can consider several forms of activation function in addition to the aforemen- tioned ones.  Activation function R is shown in Fig. 1.5. The existence of the linear part allows one to implement continuous activation functions on the basis of such elements. The ac- tivation function R can be relatively simply implemented.  Activation function S  sigmoid function . This function is represented in Fig. 1.6. The expression for this function is y =  1 + e–g –1.  As  distinct  from  the  activation  function R,  the  sigmoid  function  possesses inversability properties and continuous differentiability properties. But this function is difficult for implementation. Its disadvantage is the existence of only positive val- ues. However, we regard this disadvantage to be insignificant, because it can be elimi- nated on the level of the network structure by the element threshold change.  Fig. 1.5.

The advantages of the use of any particular activation function are determined by the complexity of their neural network implementation and by their adaptation to the selected class of problems.

Input signal type  dimensionality, discreteness, etc. ; 2. Types of operations that are implemented in the open-loop neural network  dis-  crete or continuous ;  3. Connection topology  direct, cross, lateral, backward, etc. ; 4. Absence or presence of desire to simulate a concrete biological system  visual or  acoustic analyzer, cerebellum, thalamus, etc. ;  5. A goal to maximally increase the operation speed; 6. Architecture limitations related to the user’s convenience or selected technological  methods;  7. Method of combining into groups of processor elements; 8. Method of performance in time  discrete or continuous ; 9. Method of weighting coefficient modification  random or ordered ; 10. Method of connection of independently tuned neural networks.  2.1 Particular Types of Neural Network Architectures  We describe below some particular neural network structures used for the solution of different problems on a neural network basis. Figure 2.1 shows the structure of a so- called neural network with direct connections.  Fig. 2.1.

Neural networks with ordered backward connections  Fig. 2.4. Neural networks with amor- phous backward connections  One characteristic property of such a network is the equality of number of inputs, outputs, and a number of neurons in each of the two network layers. Another charac- teristic property is the existence of so-called lateral connections between neurons of the first and second layers. Lateral connections in Fig. 2.1 have a limited structure  lim- ited area . Figure 2.2 shows a particular structure of a two-layer neural network with adjustable weighting coefficients of the second layer that are determined by the output signals of the first layer.  Figure 2.3 shows an example of a neural network structure with ordered backward connections, and Fig. 2.4 shows an example of a neural network structure with amor- phous backward connections.   2.2  ·  Multilayer Neural Networks with Sequential Connections  45  Fig. 2.5. The main types of neural net- works with lateral connec- tions: a lateral connections that are repeated on each pro- cessor element; b lateral con- nections that are repeated on each processor element; c each input has its specific distribu- tion over the field of processor elements; d lateral connections can be of any arbitrary type  Figure 2.5 shows particular neural network structures with lateral connections that  are most often used in the systems of signals and pattern processing.  2.2 Multilayer Neural Networks with Sequential Connections  Historically, multilayer neural networks appeared in the theory of pattern recognition for the following reasons:  1. The linear divisional surface  linear threshold element  does not provide sufficient probability of correct recognition in the case of distributions that differ from nor- mal distribution with equal covariance matrices.  2. The hyperplane cannot implement any Boolean function of N binary variables in  N-dimensional space when N ≥ 2.  3. In order to increase the probability of correct recognition in the case when two assemblages of vectors of two different pattern classes are distributed according to the law that is more complex than normal distribution with equal covariance ma- trices,  special  pattern  recognition  systems  implementing  a  nonlinear  divisional surface are usually constructed. In particular, such a surface can be defined by the expression   46  Chapter 2  ·  Qualitative Characteristics of Neural Network Architectures  Fig. 2.6. Block scheme of the neural network implementing piecewise linear divisional surface  Implementation of pattern recognition systems with a nonlinear divisional surface is a complex practical problem. It consists in the adjustment of a large number of coeffi- cients  the approximate order is  N + r !  N! r! where N is the dimensionality of the feature space, and r is the order of the divisional surface .  For example, when N is about several hundreds and r is about 6–8, then the number of adjustable weighting coefficients amounts to several milliards. The difficulties of the solu- tion to design a nonlinear divisional hypersurface are overcome by the use of its piecewise linear approximation. If a hypersurface of r order is sufficiently well approximated from the viewpoint of the correct recognition probability, then the number of adjustable coef- ficients is Nr, i.e., in the aforementioned example it amounts to several hundreds. In the task of pattern recognition and in some other tasks with a neural network having neurons in the first layer with a finite number of solutions, one must solve a problem to rank dif- ferent areas of the initial multidimensional feature space as a particular class  Fig. 2.6 . Such areas appear due to the intercrossing between hypersurfaces implemented by the neurons of the first layer. Each area is determined in the form of set H1 of binary signals  H1 is a number of neurons in the first layer  whose values are  0,1  or  +1,–1  at the output of neurons of the first layer and of the corresponding value of the output signal of the whole system. The unit for ranking areas must implement in this specific case some function y y1  h1  of H1 binary elements.  This logical function must in turn be realized by the neural network due to the known advantages of the threshold logic and due to the requirement of functional uniformity of the whole system. Figure 2.7 shows a graph of a multilayer neural net- work with sequential connections.  A detailed classification of multilayer neural networks with sequential connections  is given in the work [2-6]. The classification is based on the following features:   cid:1  Number of neuron layers with adjustable coefficient;  cid:1  Number of neuron layers with fixed coefficients;  cid:1  Method of coefficient fixation.   2.3  ·  Structural and Symbolic Description of Multilayer Neural Networks  47  Fig. 2.7. Graph of a multilayer neural network with sequential connections  The following structures are described in particular: a two-layer network with ad- justable coefficient of neurons of the first layer and fixed or adjustable coefficients of neurons of the second layer; a three-layer neural network with different variants of layers with adjustable and fixed coefficients.  The two-layer neural network with adjustable coefficients has limited capabilities in the sense of implementation of different configurations of divisional surface because the neuron cannot realize an arbitrary Boolean function of N ≥ 2 binary variables  in this case, the neuron of the second layer is considered . If limitation on the neuron number of the second is absent, then the implementation of the piecewise linear surface of arbitrary configuration requires not more than three layers in the neural network.  The problem of the three-layer neural network synthesis under the given number of layers in the first and third is reduced to the minimization of the number of neurons of the second layer and adjustment of neural network coefficients. The investigations of multilayer neural networks with sequential connections showed that their perfor- mance quality is a monotone increasing function upon the increase of the number of layers and number of neurons in each layer.  2.3 Structural and Symbolic Description of Multilayer Neural Networks  One can mention that recently, the significance of structural methods sharply increased in the investigations of different systems as compared with symbolic methods. The main reasons for this tendency are such properties of these systems as multilayer char- acteristics, multiple image and high dimensionality. Namely, these properties possess modern neural networks. The present study is aimed at the development of a struc- tural approach. In this approach, the relative role of the learning block development decreases, and correspondingly the role of choice of the open-loop system structure increases. This is the reason that in addition to the open-loop system symbolic de- scriptions, it is necessary to use the structural representation of transformations. We give below a formal description of the main types of multilayer neural networks.   48  Chapter 2  ·  Qualitative Characteristics of Neural Network Architectures  a Two-layer neural network  b Multilayer neural network of neurons with continuum solution   2.1    2.2   Here N = H0 is the dimensionality of the initial feature space.

A symbolic description of such a system is relatively simple to obtain from Eq.  2.2  and from the graph of the neural network shown in Fig. 2.7. In particular, one can consider the case of signals ε n  and y n  with equal dimensionalities.  d Multilayer neural networks with cross connections.  In multilayer neural networks with full cross connections [I-6], the set of fea- tures of j-th layer  j = 1,…,W  consists of features of the initial space and output signals of all layers with numbers from 1 to  j – 1 .  Analysis of particular structures with full cross connections shows that they are significantly simpler in terms of the number of neurons than those of structures with full sequential connection under the condition when both structures imple- ment the same configuration of divisional surfaces in the feature space.

The difficulties of physical implementation of adjustable variable weighting co- efficients of multilayer neural networks are well known. They emerged, in particu- lar, at the development of memistor systems in the 1960s. Their authors tried to implement an open-loop system and block neural network adjustment in the ana- logue form [2-12].  These difficulties remained the same on the modern stage of VLSI technology. However, the sharp increase of the integration level provides  implementation of neural networks with neurons having k-valued weighting coefficients realized, for example, on the resistor networks. In the simplest case, the binary values  0,1  of weighting coefficients realized on the monitored switches can be used. This pro- vides sharp simplification of physical implementation of the multilayer neural net-   2.3  ·  Structural and Symbolic Description of Multilayer Neural Networks  51  Fig. 2.12.

Multilayer neural network  work adjustment procedure consisting of such adjustable coefficients. When con- sidering each neuron with k-valued or binary coefficients, a logical function in the input variable space is realized. This is done by means of the divisional hyperplane slope change by some fixed level  Fig 2.11  or by the use of hyperplane “parts” of three types on the total hypersurface  Fig 2.12 .  Evidently, the lower the number of gradations the weighting coefficients of neu- rons in the neural networks have, the higher the number of neurons in the neural network is necessary for the solution of some problem.  The modern level of technological development is quite ready to accept a gen- eral neural network structure represented in Fig. 2.13. Methods of adjustment al- gorithm synthesis for such neural networks are the main subject considered in the present book.   52  Chapter 2  ·  Qualitative Characteristics of Neural Network Architectures  Literature  [2-1] [2-2]  [2-3] [2-4]  [2-5]  [2-6] [2-7]  Stafford N  1965  Multilayer learning circuits.

This structure can be taken a priori, or according to the aforementioned reasons while considering a two-layer and three-layer neural network, or according to the limited technology facilities. We consider below the possibility of the structure selection  number of layers and number of neurons in the layer  for a multilayer neural network with cross connections consisting of neurons with two solutions.  3.1 About the Problem Complexity Criterion  It is necessary to discuss the problem of a complexity criterion for a pattern recognition task solved by the multilayer neural network. The number of reference patterns included in the closed areas by hyperplanes realized by a neuron of the first layer in the initial feature space can serve as such a criterion when a deterministic neural network model is used. In the case of a probabilistic neural network model, each reference pattern corresponds to the mode of distribution probability function for pattern assemblage at the neural network input. In each area of the initial feature space, the multilayer neural network selects some compact pattern set but not the reference pattern. When the assemblage of patterns pos- sesses multimodal distribution at the neural network input, these compact sets can be char- acterized by some areas in the multidimensional feature space formed by lines of equal distribution probability function values  on the certain level . The number and complexity of such areas characterize together the complexity of the solved problem. The determinis- tic neural network model can be considered as a particular case of the probabilistic one, and it realizes at the bottom the system of memory for a finite number of multidimensional vectors. The number of areas realized by the multilayer neural network in the initial feature space is considered in this paragraph as a quality criterion of this neural network. The quality of the aforementioned multilayer neural network with sequential connections in- creases with the increase of the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer. Therefore, the problem of neural network optimization  minimization of numbers of layers and neurons  is formulated either to eliminate neuron number redundancy, or under limitation on the number of neurons.  The main attention below is paid to the multilayer neural networks with full cross connections. In this case, a feature set of each j-th layer consists of features of initial space and input signals of the first, second and  j–1 -th layers. The problem of structure opti- mization for such a neural network is relevant.   54  Chapter 3  ·  Optimization  of  Cross  Connection  Multilayer  Neural  Network  Structure  3.2 One-Dimensional Variant of the Neural Network with Cross Connections  Let us consider the principle of cross connection operation on the simplest one-di- mensional example with N = 1  one feature x . Figure 3.1 shows a block scheme of such a neural network. The divisional surface realized by the network without a cross con- nection is shown in Fig. 3.2.  In regions I, II and III, analogous output signal of the neural network g under the  activated cross connection is represented in the form  The neural network divides each of the regions I, II and III into two subregions, where g ≥ 0 and g < 0. From the condition of zero values of gI, gII, gIII, one obtains the expressions for additional thresholds under the activation of a backward connection in the space X:  Thus, the considered neural network  Fig. 3.1  realizes not more than five thresh- olds that divide the x axis into six regions. The neural network in this case is equivalent to the multilayer neural network with sequential connections consisting of five neu- rons in the first layer. This means that the neural network with cross connections is realized much more simply than the neural network with sequential connections.  Fig. 3.1.

The maximum number of regions Ψ NH1 is determined ac- cording to the following recurrent Eq.  3.1 :   3.1    3.2    3.3   or in the non-recurrent form  and  It is implied that Ct  s = 0 if t < s. The following expressions can be derived from  3.1 :  3.3 Calculation of Upper and Lower Estimation of the Number of Regions  Let us consider a multidimensional variant  i = 1,…,N  of the neural network with the structure shown in Fig. 3.3.  The  number  of  areas  formed  by  the  division  of  the  initial  feature  space  by  the  j – 1 -layer neural network is designated as Ψ N,[j–1], where [j–1] conditionally indi- cates the equivalent number of hyperplanes realized by the multilayer neural network with full cross connections and with the  j–1 -th layer. Such a network consists of  neurons, where Hi is equal to the number of neurons in the i-th neural network layer. The input channels of each hj-th neuron of the j-th layer  hj = 1,…,Hj  can be divided into two sets, as it follows from the block scheme. The first set consists of the input signals of the neural network. The second one consists of the output signals of the  Fig. 3.3.

Then the equation of the di- visional surface realized by one hj-th neuron of the j-th layer takes the form  Here ahj1 is the vector of adjustable weights of the neural network input signals of the hj-th neuron; ahj2 is the vector of adjustable weights of the input and intermediate signals of the  j–1 -layer network of the hj-th element; a0 hj is the threshold of the hj-th neuron; and xk,j–1 is the vector of the neuron output signal of the  j–1 -th layer.  Therefore, relative to the initial feature space, each neuron in the j-th layer imple- ments as much parallel hyperplanes as it is the number of variants of xk,j–1 that are generated by the  j–1 -layer neural network. Let us assume that there exists such an adjustment procedure in which all hyperplanes generated by vector xh,j–1 of the j-th layer belong to the initial feature space area corresponding to it. Then the recurrent equa- tion for the calculation of the upper estimation of number of regions can be written in the form  This follows from the fact that each of the Ψ  sub-network is divided into Ψ relationship  3.1 .  NHj regions, where Ψ  N[j–1] regions selected by the  j–1 -layer NHj is determined by the recurrent  Let us now find a non-recurrent equation. Equation  3.4  and the fact that the first  layer of the neural network divides the feature space into Ψ  NHj areas result in  In order to derive the estimation for the lower number of regions, let us assume that several hyperplanes out of Ψ N[j–1] hyperplanes can be put through any point of the initial space by the change of only a free term in the equation of hyperplane. These hyperplanes can belong to any area. The system of linear equations of relatively adjust- able weights and the threshold of the hj-th element for the estimation of their numbers has the form   3.4    3.5    3.6    3.4  ·  Particular Optimization Problem  57  Here qi  i = 1,…,Ψ  N[j–1]  are arbitrary given values. The number of values qi that satisfies  3.6  is a required number of hyperplanes out of the number Ψ N[j–1] that can be put through any point of the initial space. This number is  Ls–1 + 1  and equals the dimensionality of vector ahj2 plus unit, as it follows from  3.5 .  Then the following recurrent equation for the calculation of the lower estimation of  number of regions is valid:  N[j–1] –  Lj–1 + 1  is the number of regions in which new hyperplanes are not NHj is the number of new regions that emerge after the parti-  Here Ψ  put through;  Lj–1 + 1 Ψ tion.

It is required to find the neuron’s distribution in the layers that maximize the number of regions Ψ formed piecewise linear divisional surface realized by the given multilayer neural network in the initial feature space.  2. The total number of neurons is given. It is required to find the number of layers and  neuron’s distribution in the layers that maximize the number of regions Ψ.  3. The number of regions Ψ that must be realized by the network and the number of neurons are given. It is required to find the structure that minimizes the number of neural network elements.  4. The number of regions Ψ is given. It is required to find the structure  the number of  layers  and  neuron’s  distribution  in  the  layers   that  minimizes  the  number  of network neurons. Note that the structure optimization by the number of regions represents a particular optimization criterion of the neural network.  Let us consider the structure synthesis of a one-dimensional variant of the network  for the aforementioned optimization problems.   58  Chapter 3  ·  Optimization  of  Cross  Connection  Multilayer  Neural  Network  Structure  1. The number of layers W and the number of neurons  are given. Let us find the neuron’s distribution in the layers that maximize the num- ber of regions Ψ 1W.

In relationship with  3.10 , the question about integrality of Hj  j = 1,…,W  arises. If H cannot be divided by W integrally, then it follows from  3.5  and  3.10  that the remaining elements must also be distributed uniformly among layers in an arbitrary way.  In this sense, Eq.  3.11  is the upper estimation of Ψ o p t W [ 1  upper estimation when H = KW, where K is an integer number.  ]  that becomes a precise   3.4  ·  Particular Optimization Problem  59  2. The total number of layers W is not given beforehand. The number of neurons H in the network is limited. Let us find an optimum by the upper estimation structure. This can be expressed in the following form:  From the evident inequality followed from  3.11 , one gets  and consequently the number of regions is a monotonic increasing quantity with the increase of the number of layers. Consequently, the H-layer neural network with one neuron in each layer is optimal. It follows from  3.11  that for this network,  is the precise upper estimation.  3. The number of layers W and the number of neurons are given. Let us find the struc- ture optimum by the lower estimation. In order to do that, let us represent  3.8  in the non-recurrent form:  According to the Lagrange method of multipliers, constrained extremum  3.12 ,  under condition  is achieved in the case when Hi  i = 1,…,W  is a solution of the system  Then H1 = H2 = … = HW =  1 W H and under given W,   3.12    3.13    60  Chapter 3  ·  Optimization  of  Cross  Connection  Multilayer  Neural  Network  Structure  It follows from  3.13  that Ψ o p t W [ 1  ]  is a monotonic increasing quantity when W → ∝ and it becomes precise when H = KW, where K is an integer number.

This is due to the fact that the number of inputs is the number of technologically complex realized multiplier units. The number of inputs at the selected structure adjustment stage is equal to the tuned coefficient space dimensionality. Therefore, the decrease of the number of neuron inputs of the multilayer neural network simplifies both implementation and adjustment.  The total number of neuron inputs in the i-th layer of the neural network with full  cross connections is equal:  Consequently, the expression for the total number of neuron inputs in the W-layer  neural network is   3.14    3.15    3.16    3.17    3.5  ·  Structural Optimization by Some Main Topological Characteristics  61  The problem of synthesis of the multilayer neural network with full cross connec- tions and optimal by the upper or lower estimation for the number of regions under the limitations upon the number γ of network inputs is formulated on the basis of  3.17  in the following way:  Index * indicates an extremum value. Taking into account  3.17 , the inverse prob- lem, i.e., the problem of synthesis of structure for a multilayer neural network with full cross connections and minimum total number of inputs under the limitation on the number of regions Ψ, has the following form:  The number of regions Ψ  N[W] in  3.18  and  3.19  is determined either by  3.5  or  by  3.7  depending on the form of estimation.  The inverse problem statement for synthesis is less practical then the direct one because the limitation on the number of input channels in the neural network is more physically valid then the limitation on the number of regions.  Example 1. Let us show that the structure of the multilayer neural network optimum by the upper estimation of the number of regions with a limitation on the number of elements in the one-dimensional case will be optimal by the upper estimation with a limitation on the total number of inputs. According to the Lagrange method of multi- pliers and  3.18  with N = 1, optimal H1 and HW are the solutions of the following sys- tem of equations:   3.18    3.19    3.20   Here λ is the Langrangian multiplier.   62  Chapter 3  ·  Optimization  of  Cross  Connection  Multilayer  Neural  Network  Structure  The solution of  3.20  is   3.21    3.22    3.23   Here W is the number of layers. It represents an integer part of the positive root of  the equation W2 + W – γ  2 = 0.  Equation  3.21  proves the initial statement.  Example 2. Let us consider the synthesis of the neural network taking into account  3.19 , where Ψ N[W] is determined by the expression  3.5 . Note that transference of a neuron from the j-th layer into the  j–j2 -th layer causes the decrease of the number of neuron inputs for the neural network with full cross connections by  and the total increase of the input numbers of the rest of the neural network elements will amount to  It follows from  3.22  and  3.23  that the transference of a neuron from the  j-th layer into the  j–j2 -th layer causes the decrease of multilayer neural network input channels if  It follows from  3.22  and  3.23  that two structures with the total number of net- Ψ]  square brackets mean rounding up  satisfy the optimiza-  work neurons H = [log2 tion condition  3.19 :  H1 = ∆; Hj = N, j = 2,…,W H1 = N; HW = ∆, j = 1,…,W – 1  Here ∆ is a remainder of division of H by N;  Both structures correspond to the equal number of inputs determined by  3.17 .   3.5  ·  Structural Optimization by Some Main Topological Characteristics  63  Example 3. Let us consider the optimization of the neural network structure that is optimal by the length of connections.  Let us assign some weight Uj1j to each connection from the j1-th to the j-th layer. Let us also designate the connection length of the input vector with the j-th layer as U0j. Then the total length of connections between neurons in the j-th layer is described  by the expression  The total connection length in the W-layer neural network is evidently equal to  Similarly to  3.19 , one can write  The number of regions Ψ in  3.25  and  3.26  is determined by the expressions  3.5  or  3.7 , depending on the form of estimation. Note that at  Uj1j = 1  j1 = 0, 1,…,W–1; j = 1,…,W  the expression  3.29  coincides with  3.17 , and expressions  3.25  and  3.26  coincide respectively with  3.18  and  3.19 .  Example 4.

Each element realizes an assem- blage of parallel divisional hyperplanes in its feature space. The maximum number of regions selected in the initial feature space by the equivalent divisional surface does H, where H is the number of network neurons. This estimation is achieved not exceed Kp only for a multilayer neural network with full cross connections.  Let us estimate a number of regions that can emerge as a result of the partitioning of the N-dimensional feature space by H1 groups of hyperplanes consisting of  Kp–1 -th hyperplane in each group. Let us designate a maximum number of regions selected by the [H1–1] group as Ψ  K p n–1]. Then similar t o  3.3  a nd  3.4  N [  Let us estimate a z value. When placing each of the  Kp – 1  hyperplanes, the num- ber of selected regions increases by the number of regions formed on the hyperplane by lines of its intersection with other hyperplanes, i.e., by Ψ Kp –1[H1–1].

The input signals of the hj-th neuron can be divided into two groups: input signal vector  x = [x1,…,xN] and row- vector y = [y1,…,yL] of output and intermediate signals of the  j–1 -layer neural net- work. Let us assume that the  j–1 –layer neural network selects Ψ Kp [j–1] regions in the N initial feature space.  Then Ψ Kp [j–1] different variants of vector y can come through the y-channels to the N inputs of the hj-th neuron. The equation for the output signal of the hj-th neuron with Kp solutions can be written in the following form:  where Ahj and A1  hj are the vectors of weighting coefficients for x and y, respectively. Each of the Hj neurons with Kp solutions realizes geometrically  Kp–1  Ψ Kp [j–1] par- N allel hyperplanes in the neural network input signal space according to  3.33 . The expression for the upper estimation of the number of regions that emerges as a result of decomposition of X space by the considered j-layer neural network has the form  Here Ψ Kp Hj is determined by  3.30  and  3.31 . Taking into consideration that  3.34  N is a recurrent expression and that the first neuron layer with Kp solutions decomposes the X space into Ψ Kp Hj regions, the expression  3.34  can be rewritten as N  The expression  3.35  allows one to formulate and to solve the problem of synthesis of the neural network structure optimum by the upper estimation of the number of regions under the limitation on the total number N of neurons in the neural network.

Neurocomputer 3,4   Chapter 4  Continual Neural Networks  A large number of parameters characterizing the input signal must be taken into con- sideration while developing multilayer neural network structures. An example is a design of a pattern recognition system with the requirement of maximum probability of correct recognition [4-1]. It is suggested to take into account continual properties of multilayer neural network characteristics in its mathematical modeling and in its tech- nological implementation.  4.1 Neurons with Continuum Input Features  The transfer to the continuum features becomes important when the dimensionality N of some feature vector xi becomes large  several hundreds or thousands . The feature vector in this case {xi, i = 1,…,N} is replaced by the function of indiscrete argument {x i , i ∈ I}, and the weighting vector {am, m = 1,…,M} is replaced by the weighting function {a m , m ∈ M}. The neuron model with a continuum of features, similar to the classic discrete case [4-2], is determined by the expression  where y is a neuron output signal; x m  is a neuron input signal; and a0 is a threshold value.  The transfer to the feature continuum at the input of the first neural network layer often excludes the requirement to quantize the input signal  for example, electric sig- nal or pattern, etc. . The method of technological implementation of the neuron weight- ing function is selected depending on the concrete physical type of the input signal. For example, when the input signal is an electric one changing in time, the weighting function must also be generated as an electric signal. In the case of optical patterns, the weighting function can be realized on the photomask. For the discrete set of neurons with continuum feature space,   4.1    4.2   The neural network structure according to  4.2  is shown in Fig. 4.1.   68  Chapter 4  ·  Continual Neural Networks  Fig. 4.1. Neural network layer with continuum input features  4.2 Continuum of Neurons in the Layer  The transfer to the continuum space of the layer output signals can be interpreted as a continuum of neurons in the layer. Then the output signal is realized not in the form of a finite-dimensional vector, for example consisting o f  + 1 a nd –1, as it is shown in Fig. 4.1, but in the form of a y m2, n  signal having valu es  + 1 an d –1 in the interval of variance of indiscrete argument  m2. Consequently,  taking  into account  4.2 , the output signal is an infinite-dimensional vector with components   4.3    4.4   The expression  4.3  forms the basis for physical implementation of open-loop sys-  tems of the type considered.  4.3 Continuum Neurons in the Layer and Discrete Feature Set  In the particular case of discrete feature set and continuum neurons in the layer under the transfer from indiscrete variable m1 to the discrete one, the expression  4.3  takes the form  This expression is the basis for the implementation of the neural network whose  particular case is represented in Fig 4.2.  The neuron’s layer output signal is an electric signal with form features at the n-th period. Electric signals am1 m2  and a0 m2  are generated inside the system at each n-th step. As distinct from the system of signal form recognition, their period is deter- mined a priori. The electric signal of two values  1, –1  in the interval  0, M2  emerges at the layer output  Fig. 4.3 .  Such a layer model with a continuum of neurons is adequate for the neurophysiologi-  cal neuron model under the pulse-frequency modulation of the layer output signal.   4.4  ·  Classification of Continuum Neuron Layer Models  69  Fig. 4.2.

Hypothetical variant of optical system implementation in the case of one-dimensional one- channel m1 and two-dimensional m2  cides with the variable of the first function. The requirement of the continuum type of the layer input space makes it necessary to realize the function x m2, n  in the form of an electric signal. At the same time, the requirement of the continuum type of the layer output space makes it necessary to realize the function  a m2, m1  in the form of an image. The main difficulty is the multiplication of functions x m1, n  and a m2, m1 . One can assume the physical existence of the optical element xstr, whose dimness  or brightness  changes in the real time along one of the coordinates depending on the form of applied voltage, and the form of the output voltage – depending on the dim- ness  or brightness  distribution along the coordinate at the integration of the inten- sity along another one. Such an element can be conditionally called a “spatial optical coupler”.  Then  the  implementation  of  this  network  could  have  the  form  shown  in   4.4  ·  Classification of Continuum Neuron Layer Models  71  Fig. 4.5, where the layer input electric signal would come to the vertical plate of the element xstr at its input, and the output signal would be read from the horizontal plate of the output element xback.  Consequently, it is difficult to consider two-dimensional m2 at the existent level of technological development because it requires the physical implementation of three- dimensional function a m2, m1 .  4.4.3 Continuum of Features – One-Dimensional m1 for Several Channels  This case has an important practical meaning because it is often necessary to recog- nize a multi-channel signal, for example, at the recognition of EEG when the simulta- neous analysis of several disposals is performed, Fig 4.6.  One can use the expression  4.2  for the neural network implementation in this case.

Taking into account  4.2 , the neuron layer structure in the case of a feature continuum and two-dimensional m1 can be repre- sented in the form shown in Fig. 4.9. The system of the image’s multiplication can be realized on the basis of optical fibers or with the help of holographic methods or a system of mirrors.  4.4.5 Neuron Layer with a Continuum of Output Values  In this case, the output space remains at the bottom to be a space of table features varying in some interval of indiscrete set of values determined by activation function, i.e., by nonlinear transformation at the neuron output. This also concerns systems  4.2 , Figs. 4.1, 4.9.  For systems  4.4 , the output electric signal has the form of a function of one vari- able taking two values  1, –1  in some interval of its variance. The transfer to the neu- rons with a continuum of solutions results in the output electric signal varying indis- creetly by its amplitude.   4.4  ·  Classification of Continuum Neuron Layer Models  73  Fig. 4.9.

A general block-scheme of such a system is shown in Fig. 5.1, where x n  is a multidimensional stochastic process having the form of pattern se- quence at the neural network input; n is a discrete argument.  Signal εεεεε n  is determined by supervisor instructions belonging to the current pat- tern at the neural network input to a particular class. Each class includes some set of patterns possessing a common property. A multidimensional output signal of the rec- ognition system y n  is generated in the form of neural network data belonging to the current pattern of a particular area in the solution space. The three spaces considered, X, E, Y, are respectively spaces of patterns, supervisor instructions and neural network output signals. The unit of neural network parameter adjustment determines vector a n  of adjustable coefficients and information about  y n  transformation structure, i.e., dependence of the neural network output signal on the input one; g n  is a vector of intermediate neural network signals.  The input signal of the neural network is [x n , εεεεε n ]. One of its characteristics is the number of εεεεε n -signal level gradations determined by the number of pattern classes. Signal x n  of dimensionality N can be in general discrete or indiscrete by its ampli- tude. If εεεεε n  is a one-dimensional signal with its level discretized into two or K grada- tions,  then  respectively  2  or  K pattern  classes  are  considered. If vector εεεεε n   has  a dimensionality N* and the number of amplitude gradations for each of its components amounts to K0 then the number of classes is  K =  K0 N*  Fig. 5.1.

The formation of a feature space and supervisor instruc- tions in the problem of device reliability forecasting  A class continuum is considered when signal εεεεε n  is indiscrete. Then the neural network adjustment can be considered as the problem of system estimation of some indiscrete parameter εεεεε for the distribution f  x,εεεεε  of some stochastic process.  A  particular  problem  of  adjustment   learning   can  be  illustrated  in  the  follow- ing  example.  Let  us  consider  the  formation  of  the  neural  network  input  signal  in the  case  of  a  feature  continuum  in  the  problem  of  reliability  forecasting  of  some device.  In Fig. 5.2, xj t0  are the curves for the time changes of some device parameter that serves as an indicator of the device reliability in the test; j is the number of the testing device; x0 is the parameter’s acceptable value.  The point of the curve xj t0  intersection with the level x0 determines the device non-failure operating time. Vector xj n  corresponding to each curve is the vector ob- tained by the curve discretization in time in the interval [0, T0], where T0 is the time of the device testing. Components of the vector correspond to the ordinates xj t0  in the points of discretization. This procedure allows one to form the feature space in this problem.  The supervisor instruction can be formed in the following way. The device opera- ′  is  given  a  priori. Vectors xj n   determined  by  the  points  of  inter- tion life time  T0 ′  belong  to  the  first   failure  section  of  the  curves xj t0   and x0  that  lie  before T0 ′ – to the second  fitting  class. Respectively, two ampli- class of devices, and after T0 tude  gradations  of  the  signal ε n   are  introduced   1, –1 .  The  t0 axis  can  be  parti- tioned into K intervals with an indication of the device type, and the signal ε n  will have  K amplitude  gradations   for  example, ε= 1, …, K . Each vector xj n   will  have its own value ε.  In the extreme case, when the t0 axis is not partitioned, the supervisor instruction for the system of the device’s non-failure operating time has indiscrete distribution. The following characteristics can be the object of analysis in each particular case: joint distribution f  x,εεεεε , conditional distribution f ′ x εεεεε  of pattern x assemblage un- der  a  given  instruction εεεεε  about  its  belonging  to  the  k-th class,  distribution  of signals f  x  and f ε εεεεε  and their different moments of distribution, etc.  The introduction of such a notion as teacher  supervisor  qualification allows one to  develop  a  unified  approach  to  the  problems  of  learning  and  self-learning.  Joint distribution of input patterns and instruction signal of patterns belonging to some class is represented on the basis of a unified approach.   5.2  ·  Joint Probability Distribution of the Input Signal for Two Pattern Classes  79  5.2 Joint Probability Distribution of the Input Signal for Two Pattern Classes  In the neural network learning process, learning sample patterns belonging to a par- ticular class is known with probability 1, i.e., the teacher  supervisor  gives the precise instruction concerning the learning sample. In the self-learning process, the signals in the learning sample are not accompanied by the instruction about their belonging, and the probability is less than 1. In the simplest case of two-mode distribution, this probability is 0.5. Let us designate as a, the probability of the supervisor instruction for the pattern to belong to some class.  It is important to analyze intermediate modes of the transfer from the problem of learning to the problem of self-learning and vice versa in the algorithm block-scheme represented in Fig. 5.3.  The  transfer  must  be  performed  by  the  change  of  the  learning  sample  member probability of belonging to a particular class in the range from a = 1 to a = 0.5  and vice versa .  The following reasons make it necessary to analyze such intermediate modes:  1. Development of a unified approach to the analysis and synthesis of learning and  self-learning modes for pattern recognition systems;  2. Solution of some practical problems. One such problem is the learning procedure  with the teacher of incomplete qualification.  The expression for the joint distribution f  x,εεεεε  of signals x n  and εεεεε n  is  where p1 and p2 are the a priori probabilities of the emergence of the first and second classes; f1 x  and  f2 x  are distributions of signals  x1 n  and x2 n  representing pat- terns of the first and second classes. Distribution  5.1   is  a  discrete-continuous  one  due  to  the  discrete  form  of εεεεε n . However, it can be written in the indiscrete form using the Kronecker delta function. The discrete representation is taken into account below by means of the replacement of the integration operations with summation operations.  The level of teacher qualification b is introduced in the following way [5-1, 5-2]:  b = 2a – 1   5.1    5.2   Fig. 5.3. Structure of mathematical model for the unified approach to the problems of learning and self-learning in the pattern recognition systems   80  Chapter 5  ·  Investigation  of  Neural  Network  Input  Signal  Characteristics  Consequently, b = 1 when a = 1, and the teacher qualification is complete; b = 0 when  a = 0.5, and the teacher qualification is zero.  Taking into account  5.2  and  5.1 , one obtains the following:  Figure 5.3 represents a structure of a mathematical model for the generation of a neu- ral network input in the considered case. Expressions  5.3  and  5.2  relate to the equal teacher qualification level for both sample classes. Equation  5.3  at  b = 1 gives the following joint distribution law for the input signal in the neural network learning mode:  The joint distribution law for the input signal in the self-learning mode at b = 0 has  the form  Here the signal of the supervisor instruction ε n  gives no information about the pattern belonging to any class because the conditional probabilities  f ′ x ε = 1  and f ′ x ε= –1  are equal.  Expression  5.3  at b = –1 gives  The teacher in this case performs an incorrect classification intentionally  the teacher  is a “saboteur” .

One obtains after substitution and integrating  It follows from  5.7  and  5.8  at b = 0: f ′ x ε  = fx x , f ′′ ε x  = f ε ε   indicating statistical independence of signals x n  and ε n  at the neural network in- put in the self-learning mode.  Let us designate the joint moment of the j-th order of multidimensional stochastic  process x n  as α j:   82  Chapter 5  ·  Investigation  of  Neural  Network  Input  Signal  Characteristics  Then the expression for the moments of distribution  5.3  has the form  where aj1 and aj2 are the joint moments of the j-th order for the assemblage of patterns of the first and second classes. One obtains in the cases of even-numbered and odd- numbered i  Consequently, the teacher qualification influences the moments of distribution f  x,ε   at odd-numbered i.  Unequal teacher qualification with respect to the patterns of the first and second classes. In some practical problems, the teacher qualification of the pattern recognition system is different for the patterns of the first and second classes. Let us introduce a stochastic matrix  where aij is the probability of the supervisor instruction to consider patterns of the j-th class as patterns of the i-th class. In this case,  or   5.9   The analysis of different variants for the relationship between b1 and b2 is an object of special discussion. For example, when b1 = 1 and b2 = 0, the teacher qualification is equal to 1 for the first class, and is equal to 0 for the second class. In this case,  This variant is intermediate between learning and self-learning modes. Moments of distribution for  5.9  have the form   5.2  ·  Joint Probability Distribution of the Input Signal for Two Pattern Classes  83  Joint distribution law in the case of “teacher’s slant about his abilities”. The teacher makes some number of mistakes in the pattern recognition system learning. Let us introduce the notion “teacher’s slant about his qualification” by some coefficient c. At c > b we have “teacher’s overestimation” of his abilities c – b. At c < b we have “teacher’s underestimation” of his abilities b – c. The question concerning the investigation of the influence of teacher’s slant and his real qualification upon the neural network opera- tion characteristics arises.  Similar  problems  can  be  also  formulated  in  the  sense  of “sabotage”  when  –1 < b < 0.  Let us designate the supervisor instruction in the case of complete teacher overes- timation as ε′. It was assumed in the previous text that ε= ε′. The uncertainty of the teacher in his abilities results in the fact that the classification of the appeared pattern as a pattern of the first  ε= –1  or second  ε= 1  class is performed with the probabil- ity  1 + c  2. Respectively, the same patterns belonging to the second or first classes are determined with the probability  1 – c  2. The joint distribution of random values ε and ε′ can be represented in the form  Consequently,  Replacing ε with ε′ in the joint distribution  5.3 , we obtain the following distribu-  tion:   5.10    5.11    84  Chapter 5  ·  Investigation  of  Neural  Network  Input  Signal  Characteristics  The derivation of  5.11  is done in the work [5-2] where the analysis of particular and general cases is performed. It is shown that in the case of different “teacher’s slant about his abilities” concerning the first and second pattern classes,  The expressions for eigendistribution, conditional distributions and distribution  moments for the input signal can be obtained from the latter equation.  5.3 Joint Distribution Law for the Input Signal Probabilities in the Case of K Classes of Patterns  The matrix of probability  akk′ that the teacher will consider a particular pattern as belonging to the k-th and k′-th class is introduced a priori when the number of classes is more than two:  It is evident that  The joint probability distribution law for signals x n  and εεεεε n  has the form   5.12   where k = 1,…,K.  In the learning mode, matrix A is a unit matrix  In the self-learning mode, the probability of considering the  k′-class  pattern  as  belonging to the k-th class is equal to 1 K for all classes:   5.3  ·  Joint Distribution Law for the Input Signal Probabilities in the Case of K Classes of Patterns  85  In the “sabotage” mode, k′-class patterns are considered with some probability of  belonging to any class except this k′-class:  Let us introduce the notion of the teacher qualification bk for the pattern recogni- tion system in the case of K classes. The relationship between probabilities akk′ and bk is nonlinear because   5.13    5.14    5.15   If this relationship were approximated by the function of the second order  then after the substitution of  5.13  one obtains  Similarly, the relationship b a  has the form  Any of the expressions of  5.14  or  5.15  can be used in concrete calculations. The expression  5.12  allows one to obtain the final expression for the distribution mo- ment:  The joint probability distribution for the input signal in the case of K pattern classes, arbitrary teacher qualification and “teacher’s slant about its abilities” with respect to each class has the form   86  Chapter 5  ·  Investigation  of  Neural  Network  Input  Signal  Characteristics  where the probability matrix C = [clk] characterizes the “teacher’s slant about its abili- ties” when considering l-class patterns as k-class ones. If the following is designated  then one obtains  The case of a pattern class continuum. The eigendistribution of supervisor instructions in the learning mode for recognition of K classes has the form  f ε ε  = pk, when ε = k, k = 1,…,K This is a function of discrete argument ε. The case of indiscrete distribution func- tion has a wide practical use when the neural network teacher cannot clearly deter- mine the patterns belonging to a particular class. It is possible  but not desirable due to the loss of information  to partition the axis T into K parts and to reduce the prob- lem with a class continuum to the problem with K pattern classes. In the case of con- tinuum pattern classes, unit matrix A and continuous function  f ε ε  in the learning mode, one obtains similar to  5.12  the following:  f  x,ε  = f ε ε f ′ x ε   and in the self-learning mode,  f  x,ε  = f ε ε fx x  A function a ε′,ε  of the probability of considering patterns objectively correspond- ing to the distribution f  x,ε′  as corresponding to the distribution f  x,ε  is introduced in the case of the arbitrary teacher qualification. Then  The joint probability distribution f  x,ε  of the neural network input signals x n   and ε n  will have the form  For the learning mode, a ε′,ε  = δ ε′-ε  and f  x,ε  = f  x,ε .   Literature  87  About nonstationary neural network input signals. Assemblages of patterns distributed inside each class according to the time dependent law fk x,n  are considered in the case of nonstationary input signals. The change of distribution f  x,ε  with time n can take place due to the change of conditional densities f ′ x ε  or distribution of supervisor instructions fε ε . The general expression for the joint distribution law of the neural network input signal has the form  In principle, one can also consider the more general case with time-dependent teacher qualification and “teacher’s slant about its abilities”. The expression for the moments of such a distribution at the current time has the form  We describe in this chapter the analysis of distribution functions for the neural network input signal in the case of arbitrary teacher qualification. In particular, we consider  learning,  self-learning  and “sabotage”  as  well  as  some  intermediate  cases. Generally, the teacher can instruct the neural network in the form of a multidimen- sional vector ε n  with dimensionality N. The formal expressions for the input signal distribution function in the majority of cases are the same. The expressions for the input signal distribution laws can be written in the general form relatively a priori probability of class appearance and conditional distributions f ′ x ε .

MIEM proc, 14:125–138   Chapter 6  Design of Neural Network Optimal Models  6.1 General Structure of the Optimal Model  The optimal neural network model is such optimal transformation of the input signal [x n , εεεεε n ] and acquisition of the output signal y n  according to the selected primary optimization criterion  Fig. 6.1 .  The upper unit in Fig. 6.1 represents a controlled system, and the lower unit repre- sents an optimal model that adjusts the controlled system. The general approach for the design of the optimal models of a pattern recognition system in the learning mode consists in the learning arbitrary characteristics of the input signal that represents two, K and continuum classes of patterns. The number of the neural network solutions is also arbitrary. The solution space has two, K and a continuum of gradations. The super- visor instructions and solution characteristics are selected a priori and independently. The design of the optimal model is performed according to the selected criterion of primary optimization. The model description is performed in the form of a divisional surface. The divisional surface partitions the multidimensional feature space into non- overlapping areas with the instruction of the corresponding area belonging to some class. Table 6.1 represents classification of neural networks according to the input signal charac- teristics and solution space for a particular form of one-dimensional signals y n  and ε n .  System of the first type with two pattern classes with binary output is most widely used.  System of the second type with K pattern classes and with number of solutions equal to K. The investigation of such a system is given in [6-1 to 6-3] for different criteria of primary optimization and different a priori information about input signal character- istics. The idea that the problem of learning during recognition of  K pattern classes can be reduced to the sequential step-by-step use of a learning algorithm for two classes  Fig. 6.1. To the optimal model definition   90  Chapter 6  ·  Design of Neural Network Optimal Models  is not correct. This is a separate problem whose optimal solution requires the genera- tion of an equivalent divisional surface starting from the first step.  The neural network solution space is characterized by the number of amplitude quan- tization levels for the output signal y n  in each channel. The neural networks with a continuum of solutions  5 or 6, Table 6.1  have an indiscrete output signal. The neural network of 8, 10 or 11 type has an indiscrete distribution of supervisor instructions.  6.2 Analytical Representation of Divisional Surfaces in Typical Neural Networks  Methods of optimal neural network model designs for K pattern class recognition are given in [6-1 to 6-3]. The expressions for optimal divisional surfaces can be obtained from the expression of a minimized functional of primary optimization and a solution of the minimization problem for this functional with the existent limitations.  The optimal neural network model is determined by the system of inequalities for the initial space partitioning into K areas. Let us consider the design of the optimal neural network models shown in Table 6.1.  Neural network of the third type. The system of pattern recognition optimal by the maximum posterior probability  in the case of two solutions  transforms the input signal x n  into the output signal y n  according to the following expression  The divisional surface is put through those points x that have equal posterior prob- abilities of belonging to the first and second classes. The multidimensional space area with higher posterior probability of belonging to the first class is taken as the area of the first class. However, points belonging to some class in a multidimensional feature space must be indicated with more definite probability in the majority of practical tasks. For the system of the first type  one divisional surface , this probability decreases as the points approach the divisional surface and becomes zero at the surface.   6.2  ·  Analytical Representation of Divisional Surfaces in Typical Neural Networks  91  Fig. 6.2. The partition of the feature space by two divisional sur- faces  The system of pattern recognition of the 3a-type has two divisional surfaces. They partition the feature space into three parts  I, II, III, Fig. 6.2  with inactive regions in which the system determines the input pattern: region I – to the first class, region II – belonging to the second class, and region III – when the current pattern cannot be classified.  The multidimensional feature space must be divided into three regions:   cid:1  Region I corresponds to the neural network decision about its belonging to the first  class  second class   cid:1  Region II corresponds to the neural network decision about its belonging to the   cid:1  Region III corresponds to the case when the neural network cannot make a decision  about the current pattern belonging to the first or second classes  Here parameters d1 and d2  0 ≤ d1  ≤ 1  determine the probability level of pattern consideration belonging to the first or second classes. It is possible, in  ≤ 1, 0 ≤ d2   92  Chapter 6  ·  Design of Neural Network Optimal Models  particular, that d1 = d2 = d or  d1 = d2 = d = 0. In the latter case, two divisional sur- faces are reduced to one surface. For two divisional surfaces, the pattern recognition system with optimal surface parameters transforms the input signal x n  into the output signal y n  in the following way: in the region I y n  = –1  first class ; in the region II y n  = 1  second class ; in the region III y n  = 0  first and second classes .  The general expression for the divisional surfaces optimal by the posterior prob-  ability value has the form  One obtains after transformations   6.1    6.2   This is the final expression for the divisional surface optimum by the posterior probability value as the primary optimization criterion. A more detailed interpretation is given in [6-1, 6-2].  The pattern recognition system optimum by minimum average risk function criterion partitions the multidimensional feature space into three regions: first and second classes of patterns belonging, and the region where the neural network cannot make a decision:  Conditional risk function is a sum of losses due to consideration of the i-th class patterns as patterns of j-th class. The losses are calculated as corresponding probabili- ties multiplied by coefficients lij  i = 1, 2; j = 1, 0, 2  of the loss matrix L  Coefficients l10 and l20 are the loss coefficients when the recognition system cannot  make a decision. It is evident that  l11   l20 > l22   6.2  ·  Analytical Representation of Divisional Surfaces in Typical Neural Networks  93  The expression for the conditional risk function has the following form:   6.3    6.4   After averaging of conditional risk functions, one obtains average risk functions  Taking into account that  and  the expression for the average risk function takes the form   94  Chapter 6  ·  Design of Neural Network Optimal Models  Consequently, the final expression for the average risk function is   6.5    6.6   It is necessary to derivate the expressions for S ′ x  and S ′′ x  that provide the mini- mum of R. It is relatively simple to show that this minimum is achieved when the ex- pressions under the integral sign are negative in the corresponding region and are positive outside it. Consequently, the minimum of R is achieved when  The expressions  6.2  and  6.6  determine the optimal neural network model for  the recognition of two pattern classes with two divisional surfaces. Let us assume  l11 = l22 = 0, l12 = l21 = 1, l10 = l20 = l0, p1 = p2  and  sions:  Figure 6.3 illustrates the changes of thresholds h1 and h2 depending on l0. The analysis of expressions for divisional surfaces provides the following conclu-  a If l0 = 0 then the region of the neural network where it cannot make a decision  occupies all of the feature space because the losses are zero;  b If l0 = 0.5 then the neural network with two divisional surfaces is reduced to the neural network with one divisional surface. In this case, the losses without recogni- tion are two times fewer than with wrong recognition. The losses with correct rec- ognition are zero;  c If 0.5 > l0 > 0 then an inactive region exists where the neural network does not con-  sider the current patterns as belonging to any class;  d If 1 > l 0 > 0.5 then the neural network realizes two divisional surfaces. The curves in Fig. 6.3 for the change of thresholds are symmetrical both relative to the line f1 x  = f2 x  as well as relative to the level l0 = 0.5. The threshold h1 determines the surface S′ x  and the threshold h2 determines the surface S′′ x ;  e If l0 = 1 then all the multidimensional feature space is considered to belong both to  the first and second classes.   6.2  ·  Analytical Representation of Divisional Surfaces in Typical Neural Networks  95  Fig. 6.3.

The neural network output signal must have Kp level gradations, i.e., at two pattern classes, the neural network makes Kp decisions. The decisions are made with some margins by the posterior probability, as it is seen from Fig. 6.4. Using the known expressions for posterior probabilities f  ε= –1 x  and f  ε= 1 x , one can obtain the expression for the kp-th solution region in the initial feature space:   6.2  ·  Analytical Representation of Divisional Surfaces in Typical Neural Networks  97  Fig. 6.4.

Consequently, this information must be represented in the neural network a priori. The following limitation for class determination in the self-learning mode is reason- able: only one mode of the input signal x n  distribution density must correspond to each pattern class.  The a priori information about the input signal significantly influences the self- learning problem solving methods. This information can be divided into three main parts.  1. A priori information about the number of classes, i.e., about the number of input signal distribution density modes. The neural network input signal distribution can be represented according to the a priori information in the form   6.19   where x n  is the input signal; f  x  is the input signal distribution density; fk x  is the patterns distribution density in the k-th class; pk is the probability of the k-th class pattern emergence; and K is the number of classes.  2. A priori information about the form of patterns distribution density in each class. 3. A priori information about probabilities pk.  A priori information about the number of classes K  about the number of input signal distribution density modes  can be of three types ordered by the decrease of the a priori information: the number of classes  modes  is known exactly; the number of classes  modes  does not exceed some given Kmax; and the number of classes  modes  is not known.  The self-learning solution algorithm for the given number of classes must be devel- oped in the first case. The self-learning algorithm optimal for the maximum number of classes and optimal for the smaller number of classes must be developed in the second case. The self-learning algorithm allows one to develop only a qualitative solu- tion for the gradually increased number Kmax in the third case. The termination crite- rion must be introduced in the latter case. The absence of the self-learning quality improvement at the Kmax increase or the excessive algorithm complexity can be such a termination criterion.  A priori information about the form of pattern distribution density in each class can be of three types ordered by the decrease of the a priori information: the distribution form is known exactly; the distribution form is not known but some distribution ap- proximation can be accepted; and the distribution form is not known.  The neural network optimal model implementation methods are dependent upon  the a priori information quantity.   114  Chapter 6  ·  Design of Neural Network Optimal Models  A priori information about probability of the k-th class pattern emergence. The a priori information for the representation  6.19  can be the following: coefficients pk are the same for all classes; coefficients are different for all classes but unknown.  The first case does not impose any limitations upon the self-learning problem solv- ing methods. The second case results in the self-learning process complexity due to the necessity to determine coefficients pk in addition to determining distribution param- eters for each subclass in the adjustment procedure.  6.5 About Neural Network Primary Optimization Criteria in the Self- Learning Mode  The primary optimization criterion also represents some additional information em- bedded in the neural network a priori. This criterion determines the quality of the recognition system that must be achieved in the self-learning mode.  It is possible to use the primary optimization criterion in all the aforementioned cases  the known pattern distribution, pattern distribution approximation, the unknown pattern distribution . Hence, the divisional surface is calculated according to the fol- lowing expression:  The solution of this equation corresponds to the threshold h1  Fig. 6.12 . The following criterion can be used when pattern distribution across classes can be  determined or approximated:  p1f1 x  = p2f2 x   The solution of this equation corresponds to the threshold h2  Fig. 6.12 . The use of the primary optimization criterion  6.20  in the self-learning mode cor- responds to the idea of self-learning human in the case of two features and two classes  Fig. 6.13 . The goal is to put a divisional surface through the places with the presence of minimum patterns.   6.20   Fig. 6.12.

Illustration of criterion  6.20   Fig. 6.14. Comparison between primary optimization criteria in the self-learning mode  It can be shown that the optimal solutions according to the aforementioned pri- mary optimization criteria in the self-learning mode are different. The particular case shown in Fig. 6.14 illustrates additional features of these criteria. Three possibilities can be mentioned:   116  Chapter 6  ·  Design of Neural Network Optimal Models  1 and σ  1. Classes are easily selected, i.e., the crosscut is small. In this case, σ  2 are much smaller than the distance between centers of classes. The optimal thresholds h1 and h2 correspond to the first and second primary optimization criteria and are close  Fig. 6.14a ; 2. The crosscut of classes is so large that the first criterion for the threshold h1 is in- valid. One of the parameters is larger than half of the distance between the centers of the classes, and the second one is comparable with it  Fig. 6.14b, σ 2 = 1 > 0.5 ; 3. The crosscut of classes is large, and thresholds h1 and h2 greatly differ. Parameters 1 and σ σ 2 are of the same order with half of the distance between the centers of the classes  Fig. 6.14c .  The obtained results have the following explanation: in the cases  1  and  3  the input signal distribution f  x  is two-modal, and in case  2  it is one-modal with un- clear qualitative sense for division of one hump of curve into two classes.  This is the reason for introducing limitations related to the modal characteristics of distribution density into the definition of classes in the problem of pattern recogni- tion. The representation of f  x  as a multi-modal function allows one to use a special average risk function as the primary optimization criterion in the self-learning mode.  6.6 Optimal Neural Network Models in the Self-Learning Mode and Arbitrary Teacher Qualification  Let us suppose that patterns are grouped around some unknown centers of bkp classes. If the function of the distance between patterns and the k-th class is  then the average risk function of x belonging to the region of the kp-th solution can be represented in the form  where   is the norm of a vector. The average risk function is  The region of the  kp-th solution  kp = 1,…,K  with minimum R is determined in  this case by the following system of inequalities:   6.21    6.6  ·  Optimal Neural Network Models in the Self-Learning Mode and Arbitrary Teacher Qualification  117  The equation for coordinates of class centers with a minimum R is  The systems  6.21 ,  6.22  determine the optimal neural network model in the self-  learning mode. The loss function   6.22   is a rather rough approximation of distribution inside the class. A more precise ap- proximation can be achieved by complication of the optimal model at the expense of the loss function complication in the following way:  or by using a more complex function ρ x, bkp  = x–bkp2. Similar to the case of the learning mode at the transfer to the solution continuum, the loss function ρ[x, b y ] is introduced in the case of the self-learning mode. Here b y   is  either  the  final  or  intermediate  result  of  the  neural  network  synthesis. The average risk function has the following form in the case of a discrete set of solutions:  where  where  In the case of a solution continuum one obtains   118  Chapter 6  ·  Design of Neural Network Optimal Models  or in another form,  The expression for the optimal neural network model is obtained by derivation of R  by y = P x  similar to the case of the learning mode:  with additional Silvester conditions for the matrix of mixed derivatives.  Let us consider the neural network optimal model with Kp = K solutions under the  arbitrary teacher qualification b. One must define the loss function l x, bkp, b, lkpk  in such a way that in the learning mode, when b = 1 then l = lkpk, in the self-learning mode, when b = 0 then l = ρ x,bkp , and when b = –1 then the primary optimization functional with the extreme inverse respective of the learning mode. Such a loss function can be written in the following form:  The expression for the average risk function is  The optimal region of the kp-th solution can be represented in the following form:  The expression for optimal values bkpi is similar to  6.22 . It was assumed above that the teacher qualification in the neural network optimal model development is exactly known. The approximate  not exact  knowledge of the teacher qualification is usually observed, for example, in the field of medical diagnos- tic solution. In the case of K = Kp classes and neural network solutions, one obtains  The optimal neural network model determined by the system of K inequalities can  be written in this case in the form   Literature  119   6.23   where k′  p = 1,…, K.  upon the class number.  It is supposed in this case that the subjective teacher qualification does not depend  Consequently, it is seen from  6.23  that when  bc = 1 and [akk′] = A1  A1 is a unit matrix , then one deals with the learning mode. In the case bc = 0 and arbitrary values of ak′k, one deals with the self-learning mode. In the general case bc = b, the system is adjustable. If the teacher qualification is zero then the system is not adjustable in the learning mode.  All of this indicates a significance of the a priori information required for the neural network optimal model design. Sometimes, it is not necessary to have such informa- tion. The amount of the a priori information about the form of f ′ x ε  determines methods  of  the  neural  network  optimal  model’s  implementation  represented  in Table 6.1.

The  following  open-loop  neural  network  structures  are  usually  considered: neurons with two, Kp, and a continuum of solutions, nonlinear and multilayer neural networks.  The  goal  of  the  open-loop  neural  network  analysis  is  the  investigation  of  ex- pressions for distributions and moments of distributions of intermediate and output neural network signals. This chapter mainly concerns the analysis of distributions and moments of distributions for the neural network errors. The functionals of the secondary  optimization  are  selected  on  the  basis  of  the  open-loop  neural  network analysis.  The functional of the secondary optimization is considered as a functional expressed through the distribution parameters of the current neural network signals and errors that are directly minimized by the multilayer neural network under the closed-cycle adjustment. The main problem is the creation of the secondary optimization func- tional corresponding to the given primary optimization criterion. The coincidence of the  neural  network  parameters  providing  minimums  of  primary  and  secondary functionals is considered as a desired correspondence.  7.1.1 Neuron with Two Solutions  The transformation performed by the neuron with two solutions can be represented in the following form:  The expressions for analogous and discrete neuron errors have the form   7.1    7.2    122  Chapter 7  ·  Analysis of the Open-Loop Neural Networks  The input signal distribution function with K = 2 is  Chap. 5   The analogous error distribution of the considered neural network is  Here  Here  and the discrete error distribution is   7.3    7.4    7.1  ·  Distribution Laws of Analogous and Discrete Neural Network Errors  123  Expressions  for  the  r-th  order  distribution  moments  in  the  case  of  analogous and  discrete  errors  of  the  considered  neural  network  can  be  represented  in  the form   7.5    7.6   In the particular case of c1 = c2 = 1 and  b1 – b2 = b, the distribution of the analo- gous  error  of  the  considered  neural  network  has  the  form  7.3   with  the  substi- tution  A1 = 2 1 – b p1; A2 = 2 1 + b p2  B1 = 2 1 + b p1; B2 = 2 1 – b p2  The discrete error distribution has the form  The expression for the neural network discrete error moments of distribution has  in the given case the following form:  and separately for pattern assemblages of the first and second classes:   124  Chapter 7  ·  Analysis of the Open-Loop Neural Networks  7.1.2 Neuron with a Solution Continuum  The transformation performed by the neuron with a solution continuum in the learn- ing mode can be represented in the following form:  In the case of a neural network input class continuum,  The joint distribution for the signal ε n  and analogous output signal g n  has the form  The neural network analogous error distribution is  Consequently, the expression for the r-th order moment of the analogous error is  The neural network discrete error distribution is  Consequently,   7.7    7.7a    7.8    7.1  ·  Distribution Laws of Analogous and Discrete Neural Network Errors  125  In the particular case of two pattern recognition learning, one obtains   7.8a    7.9    7.10   and separately for pattern assemblages of the first and second classes  The latter expressions allow one to obtain the expressions for some particular cases:   126  Chapter 7  ·  Analysis of the Open-Loop Neural Networks  7.1.3 Analysis of a Neuron with Kp Solutions  The joint probability distribution of the input signal for the recognition system of K pattern classes in the learning mode has the form  In this case,  For the assemblage of K-class patterns,  The analogous error distribution will have the following form:  The distribution of discrete output signal of the considered neuron type for the k-th  class can be obtained in the following form:   7.10a   Similar to the previous case, here   7.1  ·  Distribution Laws of Analogous and Discrete Neural Network Errors  127  Consequently, the discrete error distribution is  The expressions for the r-th order moments of distributions for analogous and dis-  crete errors can be represented in the form  The expression for the  r-th moment of distribution for analogous error has the  form  After the change of variables x1 = y1;… xN–1=  yN–1,  one obtains   128  Chapter 7  ·  Analysis of the Open-Loop Neural Networks  7.1.4 Analysis of a Pattern Recognition System with a Nonlinear Divisional Surface  It was shown in [7-4] that a pattern recognition system with a nonlinear divisional surface can be represented by the equivalent system consisting of an inertialess layer of nonlinear transformations and a neuron. It can be shown that if the nonlinear trans- formation layer forms vector components  x1, …, xN, {zi1,i2}, …, {zi1,…,ir}  from vector components  x1,…, xN , where i1,…, ir = 1,…, N, and zi1,…,ir = xi1,…,ir, then the distri- bution density of this layer output signal can be represented by the distribution den- sity f  x  in the following way:  The expression for the second moment of distribution for the discrete error of the  considered nonlinear system has the form  where  It must be taken into account that the expression  determines a linear divisional surface in the initial feature space.

The general requirements for the neural network secondary optimization were men- tioned in the introduction. The functional parameters that are required for the itera- tion search procedure must be sufficiently and simply measured and evaluated. This functional must have a simple form relative to the adjustable neural network coeffi- cients. It must be minimal at the  same adjustable neural network parameter values that provide an extremum of some primary optimization functional.  The  analysis  of  expressions  7.5   and  7.6   for  the  moments  of  distribution  ac- tivation  function  analogous  and  discrete  error  results  in  the  following  conclusion [7-2, 7-3]:   130  Chapter 7  ·  Analysis of the Open-Loop Neural Networks  1. The odd-numbered moments of neural network analogous and discrete error dis- tribution in the learning mode cannot be used as a secondary optimization func- tional. However, their absolute values can be used as such functionals.  2. The even-numbered moments of the aforementioned distributions can be used as the secondary optimization functional. In the case of discrete error, only consider- ation of the first and second moments order must be performed because the mo- ments of higher order are proportional to α  3. The main goal of this chapter is the analysis of the primary optimization criterion, the a priori information about the input signal characteristics and the loss matrix corre- sponding to the minimization of the selected secondary optimization functional.  4. The analysis of the expressions for α  2a in the case of a neuron shows that the minimization of these secondary optimization functionals is equivalent to the minimization of the average risk function under consideration of only the first order moments of distribution for pattern assemblages of different classes. It is consid- ered that the emergence of a priori probability activation function patterns is the same for all classes, and the following restrictions upon the loss matrix coefficients takes place:  l22 – l21  =  l11 – l12 .  1a and α  5.

The analysis of the expression for the second moment of the discrete neural net- work error distribution α 2g minimization results in satisfying the optimization criterion for the average risk function under the previous conditions.  1 shows that the α  2g and p1r1 = p2r2 for α  7. Additional limitations related to the finite number of considered moments for α  1g and α 1g make these functionals a single-extremum under the limited structure of the open-loop system and multi-modal input signal distri- bution. Functional α 2g can be a multi-extremum in the general case local minimum for the average risk function and l22 – l21 = l11 – l12.  8.

The consideration of the aforementioned functionals of secondary optimization is interesting in spite of the limitations because it results in the sufficiently simple adjustable system implementation with the closed-cycle adjustment, and it can be useful in the design of the neural network with flexible structure.  7.3 About Selection of the Secondary Optimization Functional in the “Adalin” System  The basis of the closed-cycle adjustment methods represented in the works of Widrow [7-1] in the so-called “Adalin” systems is the minimization of the second moment of analogous error distribution. He used the following rule:  It can be shown using some geometric arguments that the mean square of discrete error is a mono- tone function of the mean square of analogous error and their minimization is a minimization of the average risk function.  This rule is not correct because the minimization of the average risk function for Gaussian distributions with different covariance matrices is performed with the help of the second order divisional surface. Let us consider one neuron system. Then the coincidence of the optimal solutions by the criteria of α 2a minimization takes place only in the case of one and the same covariance matrices corresponding to the first and second pattern classes [7-2].  2g and α  Let us analyze the extremum properties of the second order moments for analogous and discrete errors of a one-dimensional neuron in order to estimate the difference between the optimal solutions by the criteria of α 1 for α 2a; 2g;  c  calculate the difference  To do that, one must   a  calculate the minimizing coefficients  a′  2a minimization. 0 and  a′  2g and α ′′ for α   b  calculate the minimizing coefficients a0 ∆α  2a = α Figure 7.1 shows the dependence ∆R = ∆α  1  – α  ′′, a1 ′′ .  2a a′  0, a′  2g a0  ′′ and a1 2g µ  2  for some particular case from [7-2] for two normal distributions with fixed mathematical expectations, one of which has a changing variance µ 2 for the distribution of one of classes.

The problems of stability and convergence of the gradient procedures and the possi- bility to accelerate the extremum search are considered. The constraints of the equation and inequality types are considered in the case of multilayer neural network implementation. The multivariable function extremum search methods develop mainly in two lines. The first one includes the design of standard search programs. The function properties in this case are taken in the sufficiently detailed form. Method convergence and precision in the stationary state is usually analyzed without investigation of transient processes dynamics.  The second line includes the design of adaptive system adjustment algorithms. The function is given in the most general form due to the problem specificity and functioning in conditions of poor a priori information about the input signal properties [8-1 to 8-29]. a multilayer neural network is a particular case of the adaptive system. The peculiar properties of the adaptive system design relate to the fact that even in the case of fixed structure of the open-loop neural network, it is impossible to know anything about the form of the secondary optimization functional. One can only know that it has some local extrema to be found in the process of closed-cycle adjustment. The adjustment circuit optimization problem for the multilayer neural network cannot generally be solved in the stage of optimization functional extremum search.  That is why the main content of Chap. 12 is the adjustment circuit optimization in the investigation of closed-loop systems with quality estimation using the current value of the primary optimization functional.  8.2 Analysis of the Iteration Method for the Multivariable Function Extremum Search  a general expression for the calculation of the system state vector in the case of func- tion Y a  extremum search at the time n + 1 by the state vector at the time n has the form  for the unit search system memory    8.1    144  Chapter 8  ·  Development of Multivariable Function Extremum Search Algorithms  Here Y a  is the secondary optimization functional; a n  is the system state vector  the current argument value for the extremum function ; K* is the [N0 × N0] matrix of coefficients; and N0 is the dimensionality of vector a.  Selection of the coefficient of matrix  K* determines the rate of convergence and  quality of the iteration method.  Procedure  8.1  describes the known search methods: scan-out, steepest descent,  gradient, Gausse-Zeydel, Rosenbrock, Pawell, Sawswell, etc.  The main problem is the selection of constraints upon the matrix  K* parameters providing the necessary quality for the function extremum search system. Let us con- sider a particular form of the neural network quality function:  Here a is the matrix of coefficients of the functional Y a ; B is the vector of coeffi-  cients; and C is the coefficient.  Consequently,  Expressions  8.1  and  8.2  give a recurrent expression for the system state vector  at step n + 1 through the state vector at step n in the following form:  a n + 1  = a n  + K*[2Ax n  + B]  or  Here Y is the unit matrix. Let us determine the coefficients of matrix K* providing the iteration procedure convergence by one step starting from any initial state. The a 1  value providing the extremum is determined in the following way:  Putting it into  8.3 , one gets the following optimal matrix K*:  The system that provides transition to  n + 1 -th step by the results obtained at the n-th step is called stable if the function value at the  n + 1 -th step is less than that at the n-th step. In the opposite case this system is called self-oscillating or an un- stable one:   8.1a    8.2    8.3    8.2  ·  Analysis of the Iteration Method for the Multivariable Function Extremum Search  145   8.4    8.5   The solution of this system of equations requires the use of a computer. The search system with particular forms of matrix K*  particular methods of extremum search  is stable if matrix K* satisfies  8.4 .  Let us obtain the non-recurrent expression for a n . It follows from  8.3 :  a 1  = K*B + [Y + 2AK*]a 0 ;  a 2  = K*B + [Y + 2AK*]K*B + [Y + 2AK*]2a 0 ;  a 3  = K*B + [Y + 2AK*]K*B + [Y + 2AK*]2K*B + [Y + 2K*a]3a 0 ;  By induction  Taking into account that  one can write the expression for a n  in the following form:  Then the final non-recurrent expression for the search system state vector is  Putting the condition of optimum for the operation speed of the search system  K = –0.5A–1, one obtains the expected result:  that corresponds to the extremum function value.  The analysis of the non-recurrent expression gives the constraints upon the matrix  K* parameters providing the search iteration procedure convergence.   146  Chapter 8  ·  Development of Multivariable Function Extremum Search Algorithms  It follows from  8.5  that  i.e., it does not depend on a 0  and equals the state vector extremum value if  where O is the zero matrix  Y, a . This expression can be used for the corroboration of the search system convergence. The expression for K* matrix providing the self-oscil- lation mode of the search procedure is given in [8-12].  8.3 About the Stochastic Approximation Method  The stochastic approximation method is realized by the search system that is similar to the gradient one. However, the system parameters  matrix K*  in this case are not fixed [8-1, 8-3, 8-6, 8-8]. The stochastic approximation method is used in the case of random erroneous measurements of minimized function gradient vector. The pres- ence of random errors makes it necessary to introduce variability for the search sys- tem parameters in order to provide zero random error for the determination of the ex- treme point. The disadvantages of this method consisting in the increase of systematic errors in the transient process of the extreme point search are mentioned in [8-29]. The present study deals with the neural network synthesis technique where the stochastic approximation method can be combined with some other search methods with fixed parameters. The closed-loop neural network design is performed under the condition of some initial indeterminateness of matrix K* that is eliminated only in the stage of analysis of the closed-loop system. The question about an optimal selection of matrix K* parameters will be ill-posed in this case because the form of the minimized function is not known in advance.  8.4 Iteration Methods for Multivariable Function Extremum Search in the Case of Equality-Type Constraints upon Variables  The equality-type constraints upon the adjustable neural network coefficients can be written in the general in the form  In the real neural networks,  i.e., there are, for example, constraints upon the sum of the coefficients.   8.6    8.4  ·  Iteration Methods for Multivariable Function Extremum Search  147  8.4.1 Search Algorithm  Y a, λλλλλ  = Y a  + λλλλλTqT a   The problem of quality function Y a  minimization in this case is solved in the mul- tilayer neural networks by the construction of the Lagrange function  where λλλλλT= [λ qM1 a ] is the vector function of constraints.  1,…, λ  M1] is the vector of Langrangian multipliers; and qT a  = [q1 a ,…,  The solution of the minimization problem is reduced to the solution of the follow-  ing system of equations:   8.7   Here  The recurrent relationship for the search algorithm follows from  8.7 :  The search system in this case can be represented by the equivalent discrete system aλ, K*λa, K*λλ. Taking into account  8.7 , the final expres-  with parameter matrices K* sion for the search algorithm can be written in the form  aa, K*   148  Chapter 8  ·  Development of Multivariable Function Extremum Search Algorithms  In this case of constraints  8.6 ,  where 1 is the column vector of dimensionality N0 + 1 consisting of 1.  8.4.2 Analysis of the Matrix of the Second Derivatives of the Lagrange Function  If  Y a   is  determined  by  8.1a   and  the  following  designation  is  introduced:  YT = [a0,…,aN0,λ  M1], then  1,…,λ  It is clear that [I] = 2A, [III] = [II]T = Q a , [IV] = 0. Consequently, the matrix of the second derivatives of the Lagrange function has the  following form:  8.4.3 Operation Speed Optimization for the Extremum Search Iteration Procedure in the Case of Equality-Type Constraints  Using the Newton method for minimization of the Lagrange function, one obtains the following conditions for the optimal operation speed:   8.4  ·  Iteration Methods for Multivariable Function Extremum Search  149  It can be shown that the existence condition for the matrix, inverse to the matrix of the input derivatives of the Lagrange function, is the condition of equality of M1 to the rank of matrix Q. Consequently,  where H = –QTA1 aλ n , K*λa n , and K*λλ n , providing the optimal operation speed for the search procedure, can be de- rived from the above equations.  –1Q, A1 = 2A.

Matrix K*λλ has the following form:   –A1  i.e., under one constraint, the optimal K*λλ is determined only by the sum of elements of matrix A1  –1 across matrix rows and columns. In this case,  Matrix K*  aλ is not a zero matrix under any a priori information about matrix a, i.e.,  the cross-connections are present in the search algorithm.  8.4.5 The Case of Constraints of Equality Type That Can Be Solved  When constraints have the linear form   8.8    150  Chapter 8  ·  Development of Multivariable Function Extremum Search Algorithms  then one can solve the system of equations for M1 variables and express coefficients a0, …, aM1–1 through remained  N0 + 1 – M1  variables. Matrix Q in this case is divided into two blocks:  Then constraints  8.8  take the following form:  where  This expression is substituted into Y a  and the extremum of the resultant function of  N0 + 1 – M1  variables is found by the previously described method. Optimal values of  N0 + 1 – M1  variables are determined. Then optimal values of M1 variables are deter- mined according to  8.9 . Taking into account  8.6 , the expression  8.9  takes the form  8.4.6 Iteration Process Stability under Equality-Type Constraints  We shall consider the search process to be stable as the Lagrange function value de- creases at each step, i.e.,  Y[y n ] < Y[y n – 1 ]   8.10   Transforming Y y  into the Taylor series in the neighborhood of point y n–1  and  throwing away the terms of higher than the second order, one obtains  Here ∆ is an incremental vector of variables. Taking into account  8.10 , one gets the  following condition of stability:   8.9    8.11    8.4  ·  Iteration Methods for Multivariable Function Extremum Search  151  The iteration procedure gives the following increment at each step:  Putting  8.12  into  8.11 , one gets after some transformations  Consequently, the sufficient stability condition is the negative definiteness of the  following matrix:  This matrix determines the relationship between Lagrange function parameters and  parameters of matrix K* of the search system.  8.4.7 Convergence of the Iteration Search Method under the Equality-Type Constraints  Let us consider the search process convergence in the case of quadratic function. In this case, Y aTλ  = aTAa + BTa + C + λTQa:   8.12    8.13   This expression can be rewritten in the form  In this case,  As it was done above, the following non-recurrent expression can be written for the  generalized state variable   152  Chapter 8  ·  Development of Multivariable Function Extremum Search Algorithms  The substitution of Y n  = A cid:1 –1B cid:1  into  8.13  shows that gradient vector of the Lagrange function becomes zero, i.e., the point Y n  = A cid:1 –1B cid:1  is the extremum point. It is sufficient to prove that  for the convergence of the iteration procedure.  In the case of matrix [Y + K*A cid:1 ] nonsingularity, the last expression is equivalent to  the following one:  8.5 Iteration Extremum Search Methods for Multivariable Functions under Inequality-Type Constraints  Such constraints for the neural network emerge in particular due to the limits for the variance of adjustable coefficients and have the form qµ a  ≤ 0  µ= 1, …, M2 .  The following constraints of this particular type usually emerge for the neural net-  work:  In the particular case of the neural network design based on the real physical ele-  ments, the following conditions are possible:  amax > 0; amin = 0  amax = –amin > 0  8.5.1 Conditions of Optimality  Conditions of optimality in this case are given by the Kune-Tacker theorem. It repre- sents the Lagrange method generalization in the case of inequality-type constraints. According to this theorem, the optimal vector a corresponding to the minimum of the  convex  functional  is  the  solution  of  the  following  system  of  equations  and  in- equalities:   8.13a    8.14    8.5  ·  Iteration Extremum Search Methods for Multivariable Functions  153  The expression for matrix Q is preserved with exchange of M1 by M2. In the expres-  sion  8.14 ,  Inequalities δδδδδ ≥ 0 and λλλλλ ≥ 0 mean that all components of these vectors are non-nega- tive. It is also assumed that there exists such a vector a that satisfies the inequality qµ a  ≤ 0. Conditions  8.14  have the following physical sense. If some constraint is not significant for the optimal vector aopt, i.e., qµ aopt  < 0 for some µ, then corresponding λµ= 0. If λµ> 0, then it follows from  8.14  that δµ= qµ aopt  = 0.  Thus, Langrangian multipliers can be regarded as some estimations of the constraint’s influence upon the optimal value of the adjustable coefficient vector. If functions Y a  and  qµ a   µ= 1, …, M2  are convex, then the Kune-Tacker theorem gives necessary and sufficient optimality conditions.  8.5.2 Algorithm of Extremum Search in the Case of Inequality-Type Constraints  The optimality conditions  8.14  give the following system of relationships for the it- eration extremum search procedure in the case of inequality-type constraints:  Finally one obtains  In the particular case of constraints  8.13a , q1 a  = a – amax  ≤ 0; q2 a  = amin – a ≤ 0;   154  Chapter 8  ·  Development of Multivariable Function Extremum Search Algorithms  8.6 Algorithm of Random Search of Local and Global Extrema for Multivariable Functions  The only reason for introducing randomness into the procedure of the neural network secondary optimization functional extremum search is the multi-modality of the in- put signal distribution. This property results in multi-extremum characteristics of the quality function of the open-loop neural network with the given structure. The ran- dom search methods are described in details in [8-2, 8-16].  The problem is to find local minimums of the multi-extremum functional of the neural network error and selection of the global minimum. Let us describe one cycle of the random search algorithm:  a The vector value of the function variables is randomly selected. This vector must be  located in the region of some local extremum;  b This extremum must be found by any of the non-random search methods given  above;  c The value of the found extremum and corresponding vector of variables are com- pared with those stored in the memory. If this extremum is absent in the memory, then it is stored too;  d The transfer to the step “a” is performed thereafter.  The results of experimental investigation of this algorithm are given in Chap. 12. The convergence rate can be in principle increased by eliminating already found re- gions from the random region set for the initial vector.  Let us analyze the convergence of this random search algorithm with respect to the number of extrema. Let i modes be already found  0 ≤ i ≤ U . The probability of occur- rence in the region of these modes under their uniform distribution is i U. The distri- bution of the random value ξ i representing the number of steps from the search of the i-th mode to the search of the  i + 1 -th mode amounts to ξ i = k with the probability   8.15   The random search procedure is performed independently at each step. Let us in-  troduce a new random value  representing the number of steps up to the search of j modes out of U. Independent events k–1= kj–1, where 1 ≤ k ≤ s + 1, …, 1 ≤ kj–1 ξ i = k1, …, ξ ≤ s + 1 and k1+ k2 + … + kj–1= s + j – 1 0 + … + ξ j = ξ give in their combination such an event that η 0 = 1 with the unit probability. Due to the independence of ξ j, the probability of such an event is  j–1= s + j. Hence, ξ  P ξ  1 = k1 …P ξ  j–1 = kj–1    8.7  ·  Development of the Neural Network Adaptation Algorithms  155  According to the formula of total probability,  In the particular case of j = U,  where P η U = s + U  is the probability that U modes will be found through s + U steps of the random search procedure. It can be shown that the average value and variance of the number of steps required for the search of U modes are  The analysis of these expressions shows a sufficient convergence rate of this search procedure. The procedure can be generalized for the case when the region of the al- ready found mode is excluded from the random search as it was mentioned above. The above expressions are valid in the multidimensional case.  8.7 Development of the Neural Network Adaptation Algorithms with the Use of Estimations of the Second Order Derivatives of the Secondary Optimization Functional  Let us consider the development of the neural network adaptation algorithms with the use of simultaneous estimations of the first and second order derivatives of the sec- ondary optimization functional.  8.7.1 Development of Search Algorithms  Let us consider the problem of extremum search in the form of an equivalent problem of the root search for the following system of equations:   8.16    8.16a    8.17    156  Chapter 8  ·  Development of Multivariable Function Extremum Search Algorithms  When considering the implicitly given system  that satisfies the Yung theorem, there exist such  that  their  substitution  into   8.18   provides  identity.

Synthesis of the unit for the calcu- lation of parameters of the neural network quality functional required for the iteration search organization is performed. The main problem in this case consists in the esti- mation of the secondary optimization functional gradient vector. There are two pos- sibilities to solve this problem. It can be done by the search procedure on the basis of analysis of search oscillation results or by the determination of gradient vector estima- tion in the form of analytical expression.  In the first case, the search neural network is used, and in the second one – the analytical neural network is used. The first case is preferable but not always possible. If the system does not provide the possibility to select the signal characterizing the optimization functional gradient, then one must use the search oscillation methods. We consider below recognition systems of different types: a neuron with two solu- tions for two pattern classes, a neuron with Kp solutions for K pattern classes, a neuron with a solution continuum and continuum of pattern classes, multilayer neural net- works consisting of neurons with a solution continuum and the existence or absence of  constraints  upon  the  adjustable  coefficients,  multilayer  neural  networks  with N*-dimensional signals ε n  and y n , and multilayer neural networks with cross and backward connections.  Methods of neural network design can be easily generalized for the case of transient patterns when the implementation of the gradient vector is the realization of a non- stationary multidimensional random process. This gradient property determines the method of multidimensional filter design in the neural network adjustment unit.  A special attention requires the problem of multilayer neural network design in the learning mode and in the mode with arbitrary teacher qualification. Methods of closed- loop neural network design in this case are the same as in the learning mode.  Design of a neural network adjustment algorithm with a closed cycle is performed by putting the expression for the estimation of the functional gradient vector into the corresponding expression for the search procedure.   164  Chapter 9  ·  Neural Network Adjustment Algorithms  9.2 Neuron with Two-Solution Continuums  Four secondary optimization functionals α 2a are considered below  for  the  neuron  with  two  solutions.

Some constraints can be imposed upon this matrix even at the given stage. In [9-5, 9-6], these constraints are determined for the stochastic approximation method. One can require the convergence of the iteration procedure to its extremum α 1a at each step, i.e., the validity of the following conditions  in a one- dimensional case :  One of the possible sets of matrix K* elements is  The choice of mn in the expression  is also a problem of analysis and synthesis of the closed-loop neural networks.

In this case, there is no possibility to create the closed-cycle adjustment algorithm satisfying criterion of minimum α 1g under the arbitrary value of memory mn for the gradient estimation filter. To show this, let us present the measured values of the second-   166  Chapter 9  ·  Neural Network Adjustment Algorithms  ary optimization functional gradient in the form of some random process. In the general case, including the criterion of minimum α 2g, the measured gradient at the current step can be conditionally represented in the form of the product of two multipliers x1 n x2 n . One of the multipliers, for example ∂[sign g n ] ∂ai can not be calculated directly through the neural network signals. Only its sign can be determined in this way. The exchange in the expression for the gradient under the arbitrary value of mn results in the loss of the possibility to determine the sign of gradient estimation because in the general case,  Consequently, the design of analytical adjustment algorithms for the neural network with two solutions and closed-cycle secondary optimization functional for discrete error can be performed only if mn = 1. Otherwise, if mn > 1, then the search adjustment proce- dure must be developed. In any case, the adjustment procedure for the estimation of ∂y  ∂a in the expression of the secondary optimization gradient must be introduced.

Taking into account that  the expression for the estimation of the average risk function gradient in the case of the neural network with neurons of two solutions will have the following form:  This expression represents a basis for the design of the corresponding closed-loop  neural network.  Let us consider the neural network with N* output channels and two gradations of  the output signal by amplitude in each channel.

Let us consider a one-dimen- sional case of the neural network with minimization of α  2a in the closed cycle.  In this case,  The averaging here must be performed across the set of realizations of the non- stationary random process at the time instant n∆T. Usually one has only a single real- ization. The value   9.10  ·  Development of Closed-Loop Neural Networks of Non-Stationary Patterns  181  is obtained by averaging across time in the memory interval mn with an additional constraint of a possible convergence of the process to the stationary state and a priori information about modification of parameters for the distribution of the non-station- ary random signal. It must be assumed that the neural network parameters  adjustable coefficient a0  are constant in the averaging interval mn in order to express the func- tional gradient estimation in the algebraic form. In this case,  The learning algorithm in the non-stationary case is determined by the following  relationship:  In order to design a closed-loop neural network, one needs the information about the character of changes of the signal xa n∆T  distribution. This information can be unambiguously obtained by the information about the character of changes in the input signal distribution parameters on the interval of the adjustment unit memory as well as information about the neural network structure. If one assumes that the pattern assemblages are normally distributed with a time-dependent mathematical expecta- tion and that the random and determinate components of the random signal xa n∆T  are statistically independent, then the hypothesis for the mathematical expectation changes is the same as in the case of the x n∆T  signal. The optimal filtering of the non-stationary signal and the aforementioned hypothesis for the first moment of dis- tribution allows one to use in the adjustment unit the same filter as in the case of es- timation of the secondary optimization functional gradient. The synthesis of such fil- ters  is  considered  in  [9-7]. Hypotheses  about  the  character  of  changes  of  the  first moments of distributions in the neural network memory interval are the same for both classes. If it is not so, then the hypothesis of the higher order for the synthesis of the estimation filter of  must be taken.  The analysis of corresponding expressions in the case of non-stationary patterns shows that the estimation of the secondary optimization functional gradient is the problem of the random signal filtering. Characteristics of the non-stationary imple- mentation of the secondary optimization functional were determined above under the assumption of the existence of some a priori information about characteristics of non- stationary input patterns. However, this method is rather complicated in the case of multidimensional  and  multilayer  neural  networks  and  secondary  optimization functionals related to the discrete error. To overcome this complexity, we introduce additional a priori information about the neural network input signal. This informa- tion allows one to reveal that the class of non-stationary characteristics of pattern   182  Chapter 9  ·  Neural Network Adjustment Algorithms  assemblages for which the a priori information about the character of time changes of gradient distribution parameters is sufficient. On the one hand, such an approach simpli- fies the filter synthesis procedure in the adjustment block. On the other hand, it allows one to design the closed-cycle adjustment algorithms with coefficient correction at each step n. In the previous cases, such a correction was performed after each mn steps.  The results of multidimensional filter synthesis given in [9-8] can be used for the neural networks with open-cycle adjustment. They can also be used for the design of the neural networks with closed-cycle adjustment at the estimation of secondary optimization functional gradients in the case of the non-stationary pattern neural networks.  9.11 Development of Closed-Cycle Adjustable Neural Networks with Cross and Backward Connections  Let us consider below only the case of the second discrete error distribution moment in the capacity of the secondary optimization functional.

A more detailed development of the closed-loop neural networks with Kp solutions  and N* output channels in the self-learning mode is given in Chap. 12.  The multilayer neural network adjustment algorithm in this case is the following:  1. The initial value y 0  is calculated by the current input signal x 0  having some initial  values of the neural network adjustable coefficients;  2. The column of matrix b y,0  corresponding to y 0  is selected; 3. The neural network coefficients are adjusted according to  9.19  and so on starting  again from point 1.  The b y  values at each adjustment step can be determined by parameters and struc-  ture of the multilayer neural network.

The adjustment al- gorithm is divided into two independent parts. One of them is determined by the term ∂y ∂a. It depends upon the open-loop neural network structure and determines the quality of the recognition solution.  The developed methods for the multilayer neural network adjustment can also be used for the adjustment of the neural network with several layers and fixed coeffi- cients.   9.13  ·  Expressions for the Estimations of the Second Order Derivatives  185  The multilayer neural network adjustment procedure  8.1  provides only the local extre- mum of the optimization functional.

Output signal of the continu- um neuron layer  The open-loop continuum neuron layer structure is described by the expression   10.22   where x2 i  is the layer output signal; xl is the input signal vector; and a i  is the vector of weighting functions for the continuum layer belonging to the piecewise differen- tiable function class with discontinuity of the first kind and a finite number of zeros  l = 1 … L .  It follows from  10.22  that x2 i  is the function with the form shown in Fig. 10.3. It represents a sequence of rectangles with different durations and unit amplitude. The function under the signum sign  can have a complex form. However, the form of the function x2 i  is determined only by the number and location of zeros of the f  i  function. Its form between the neigh- boring zeros is not important. Hence, the weighting functions a i  can be approximated rather roughly  Fig. 10.4  or more precisely  Fig. 10.5 .  The adjustment procedure is organized in the following way. The approximation interval  is  divided  into  S parts.  The  set  of  piecewise  constant  weighting  functions  each one determined by S coefficients  or the piecewise linear weighting functions  each  one  determined  by  2S coefficients   are  constructed  thereafter.  Then  the  co- efficients that determine the weighting functions are adjusted by means of the gradi- ent method.  The probability of the correct recognition is used as the neural network quality criterion. It is calculated with the use of the test vector sample. If the correct recogni- tion probability under the given number of steps of the learning procedure is less than the required value, then the number S is doubled and the adjustment procedure for the adjustable coefficients is repeated.   10.6  ·  Three Variants of Implementation of the Continuum Neuron Layer Weighting Functions  197  Fig. 10.4.

Weighting function of the continuum neuron layer  As a result, the following important goal is achieved. The layer with the large num- ber of neurons is replaced by the continuum neuron layer, i.e., N weighting coefficients  for each feature  are replaced by the weighting function curve. This weighting func- tion is approximated by the piecewise linear or piecewise constant function required for sufficient recognition probability. The resultant weighting function is described by a sufficiently small number of parameters, at least less than the number of parameters in the case of a discrete neuron layer. The piecewise constant approximation of the weighting function curve is represented in Fig. 10.6.  The maximally monotone function  with minimum number of sign changes of its derivative  provides the minimization of the number of the weighting function ap- proximation intervals using renumbering  ranging  of neurons in the layer.   198  Chapter 10  ·  Adjustment of Continuum Neural Networks  10.7 Learning Algorithm with α2g Secondary Optimization Functional  the Five-Feature Space  for the Two-Layer Continuum Neural Network  The structure of such a neural network is described by the functional expression  Let us consider the case of the functional α  2g.

Therefore, the problem of selecting initial conditions for the system adjustment is an important part of the neural network theory. The quality of such selection significantly influences the quality of the solution. Usually this aspect is not considered.  It  seems  that  only  Rosenblatt  [11-1]  mentioned  this  problem. However,  he  took the zero initial values of coefficients in all the experiments. This does not guarantee the achievement of extremum with a satisfactory value of optimization functional. This  is  especially  the  case  in  the  problems  with  multi-extremum  optimization functionals.  One can consider two methods of selection of such initial conditions: selection of random initial conditions and selection of deterministic initial conditions. In the first method, the multi-extremum secondary optimization functional is used. The random elements are introduced into the procedure of the secondary optimization functional extremum search for the search of the local and global extrema of this functional. The local extremum search is necessary for the solution of the problem of the structure minimization for the multilayer neural network. The impression of a too large num- ber of the local extrema in the space of the adjustable coefficient emerges at the first stage of the use of the random initial conditions. However, the enlargement of the open-loop neural network structure results in the increase of the numerosity of the multilayer  neural  network  states.  This  numerosity  is  estimated  by  the  secondary optimization  functional  value.  This  means  that  the  majority  of  the  local  extrema provide  one  and  the  same  quality  of  recognition.  This  remark  must  be  taken  into account  in  the  methods  described  below  of  the  multilayer  neural  network  quality estimation by estimation of the secondary optimization functional value. The experi- mental results obtained in this chapter and the aforementioned comment show the validity of the approach to the problem of adjustment with the use of the random initial conditions in spite of the fact that such an approach introduces redundancy in the time of the neural network adjustment.  The goal of the second method with deterministic initial conditions is the a priori introduction of the neural network into the region of one of the local extrema of the secondary optimization functional. The multilayer neural network must be maximally amorphous at the level of the first, second, etc., layers, i.e., it must be ready to solve the   208  Chapter 11  ·  Selection of Initial Conditions During Neural Network Adjustment  Fig. 11.1. Divisional surface at the selec- tion of initial conditions: 1 – the first class; 2 – the sec- ond class  most complex  from the point of modality of f  x   recognition problem. The prelimi- nary variant of the possible structure of the divisional surface in this case at the prob- lem of learning for recognition of two pattern classes is represented in Fig. 11.1. The final variant can be determined only after introducing the criterion of amorphism or dispersion.  It is evident that the multilayer neural network with the lowest amorphism and dispersion is the neural network with equal coefficients of the first layer neurons and with corresponding divisional surfaces shifted to the “margin” of the feature space. The physically implemented feature space region is shown in Fig. 11.1 by the dotted line. This also takes place in the self-learning mode if there is no preliminary information about the cells in Fig. 11.1 belonging to this or that class. The initial condition for the adjustable coefficients of the second, etc., layers is calculated by the geometry of the divisional surface realized by the neurons of the first layer with instruction concerning belonging of the initial feature space regions to this or that class.  The initial conditions are selected according to the a priori information about dis- tributions at the already-known structure of the open-loop neural network and se- lected optimization functional. The selection of initial conditions depends not only on the selection of vector a 0  but also on the method of calculation of parameter matrix K elements at each procedure step. Methods for the selection of initial conditions can be ordered by the form of the used information:   cid:1  Random initial conditions without use of the learning sample;  cid:1  Deterministic initial conditions without use of the learning sample;  cid:1  initial conditions with use of the learning sample.  11.2 Algorithm of Deterministic Selection of the Initial Conditions in the Adjustment Algorithms for Multilayer Neural Networks  This algorithm uses a priori information about mode configuration in the feature space, their number and variance.

Designations of corresponding classes are  r1i i=1,…,K1 ,  r2i i=1,…,K2   Let us organize monotone sequences for the mode projections on each coordinate axis:  where i1,2 are the numbers of modes of the first and second classes.

The first layer was considered above. For example, let the coefficients of the first layer be de- termined as a result of deterministic selection, and thus the set of sections is obtained. Each section corresponds to the number consisting of  + 1 and –1. If this set provides the location of the divisional surface close to the optimal one  the recognition error is small , then the probability that this section configuration will be changed is small. The estima- tions of such a probability are given below. The learning samples for the second, etc., lay- ers will be preserved with this probability. The obtained coefficients can remain constant if they correctly perform decomposition of the output space of the previous layer.  Figure 11.4 shows the example of the second and third neuron layer coefficient values dependent upon the classes’ number distribution across sections when the configura- tion is not changed. In the cases a–d, the logic function is realized on the neuron of the second layer. In the case e, the three-layer neural network is realized.  Let us consider the problem of coefficient fixation in more detail. Let some piece- wise linear surface be realized in the feature space. Each section must correspond to some class number in order to form the learning sample.  Fig. 11.4. Example of the second and third neuron layer coefficients value dependent upon the classes’ number distribution across sections   11.3  ·  Selection of Initial Conditions in Multilayer Neural Networks  213  It can be done in the following way. First, one obtains the correspondence between each element of the learning sample and the section number. Then one determines the class number corresponding to the maximum number of its patterns in each section. And this class number will correspond to this section. Then it is necessary to select optimal  coefficients  for  the  second  layer. Since  the  piecewise  linear  surface  in  the majority of diagnostic problems is not very complicated, then one can obtain experi- mental tables of correspondence for the second layer of neurons to the given configu- ration. Though this task is rather complex and time-consuming, its solution provides the reduction of the initial condition selection to the deterministic selection of the initial conditions for the first layer and fixation of the coefficients of the following layers using such tables. The estimation for the probability of preservation of configu- ration in the feature space is given below.  Let us consider the deterministic selection of the initial conditions for the multi- layer neural network with three neurons in the first layer shown in Fig. 11.5. Table 11.2 represents the values of the logic function  Y with the first layer outputs as its argu- ments. The values of this function on sections are represented for the given configu- ration. Here yi  i = 1,2,3  are the outputs of the first layer neurons. Such a function can be realized by two neurons of the second layer with coefficients:  Sections in Table 11.2 can be modified in the process of further learning. Their number is 2H1 – m, where H1 is the number of neurons in the first layer and m is the number  of  sections  selected  as  initial  conditions.  In  our  example,  two  sections, [ + 1, + 1, –1] and [–1, + 1, –1], can arrear. One obtains under the fixed coefficients of   11.6   Fig. 11.5. Example of the deterministic selection of the initial condi- tions for the multilayer neural network with three neurons in the first layer   214  Chapter 11  ·  Selection of Initial Conditions During Neural Network Adjustment  the first layer that the new sections belong to the first class. It is seen from Fig. 11.4 that the first section increases the recognition error because the element of the second class will appear there, and the second section does not increase the error. The classification error can increase  as a result of fixation the coefficients of all the layers are higher than the first one  in the following situations: first, if the new sections are considered as belonging to the other pattern class, and second, if the old section that will change its configuration in the learning process gets more other class patterns than before. j = 1,…, m. Let the first class correspond to the number of the section εi and let this section get Si elements of the second class in the process of the initial condition selection. Then the probability of the wrong clas- sification obtained due to the surface of this section is Si Mi, where Mi is the number of patterns in the section εi. Further closed-cycle learning must involve those hyper- planes whose change will decrease the error probability Si Mi. The probability of the section deformation in the learning procedure can be defined as  Let us consider the section εi = {εi  1,…, εi  k}, εi  Let us assume that dependence of the section deformation upon the probability Si   Mi is linear  and that patterns are uniformly distributed along the section with the density Siρ. Then,  → 0 if Vi  Evidently, pi  → 0, Siρ= const, and pi  → 0 if Siρ→ 0, Vi = const. This means that the probability of the section deformation that does not contribute to the recog- nition error is zero, and that under the constant distribution density Siρ, the decrease of the section volume results in the decrease of the number of elements Si that it gets thus → ½  under the decreasing the probability  11.9 . In the case of Vi assumption that the sample includes for  M 2 elements of each of two classes . The averaging of  11.9  for all the m sections gives  → V0, one gets pi  and taking into account that  for each pi, one gets the estimation for the average section deformation probability under the considered configuration:   11.7    11.8    11.9    11.3  ·  Selection of Initial Conditions in Multilayer Neural Networks  215  As a result, it is seen that it is possible to estimate the probability of the already existent section deformation in the learning process at the stage of initial condition selection for the first layer neurons, i.e., to estimate the validity of the use of fixed coefficients of the following layers.  Taking into account the above considerations, one can present the initial condition  selection method for the multilayer neural networks.  1. The piecewise linear surface is drawn in the feature space with the help of the de- terministic algorithm of the initial condition selection for the first layer neurons; 2. The correspondence between the i-th pattern of the learning sample and the sec- tion number  εj = 1,…, m  is found with the help of the examination of the first layer across all of the learning sample; 3.

The logic function realization on one neuron of the second layer is checked. If this function is realized then the initial condition selection is terminated at the stage of the second layer neuron learning;  6. If this does not take place, then the initial condition selection is performed on the neurons of the second layer either in a way similar to p. 1 or with the help of tables of correspondence of the second layer coefficients to the specified section configu- rations;  7. A similar procedure is used for the following layers; 8. The sub-samples for the first layer learning are formed: one checks successively for each section εj which hyperplanes that form this section contribute to the error Sj, then it shifts each hyperplane by ±rj  rj > rj 0 is the mean distance between the nearest patterns that occurred in the given section, and it checks the change of Sj.

The aforementioned method reduces the multilayer neural network learning to the  learning of the first neuron layer.  11.4 Initial Condition Formation for Neural Network Coefficient Setting in Different Problems of Optimization  Generally, multilayer neural networks in solving mathematical problems form the multi- extremum optimization functional in which the connection is the best, and often the only decision is reaching during the setting process using a system of a global extre- mum of the given functional. In the overwhelming majority of works, the initial con- dition selection is suggested to be made through the following methods:   cid:1  To choose ground initial conditions;  cid:1  To choose initial conditions of setting casually;  In this work, it is suggested that the initial conditions of setting the multilayer neu- ral network weight coefficients is chosen for solving mathematical problems in a spe- cific way of solving every problem. In the first turn it creates the following problems:   cid:1  Systems of algebraic equalities;  cid:1  Systems of algebraic inequalities;  cid:1  Approximation and extrapolation of functions;  cid:1  Pattern recognition, as a particular problem of function approximation;  cid:1  Clusterization or self-teaching;  cid:1  Optimization;  cid:1  Dynamic object modeling.  In the succeeding period, a quantity of current problems in the neural network logical basis will be increased [11-5, 11-6] and correspondingly for other problems the methods of initial condition formation will be developed for a multilayer neural network setting. The problem of initial condition choice  formation  in its turn is separated into two  parts:   cid:1  Formation of the main idea  algorithm  of the choice of initial conditions;  cid:1  Weight coefficients of the neural network calculation of a chosen structure as initial  for setting in an adaptive regime.  Some problems of the initial condition choice in a given work are defined only without a presentation of a final decision; in our opinion this is what is also important for a correct orientation of the researchers in this field.  Here the main goal is defining the problem of initial condition formation for the coefficient setting in the multilayer neural networks by using a specific method for every concrete problem.   11.4  ·  Initial Condition Formation for Neural Network Coefficient Setting in Problems of Optimization  217  11.4.1 Linear Equality Systems  The main idea of the choice of initial conditions for two variants of investigated neural network algorithms to solve the algebraic equalities is presented in Figs. 11.6a and 11.6b. In the first version of the neural network algorithm of solving the algebraic equali- ties systems in the case of a one-layer neural network the initial conditions of X vector is offered to calculate, solving N equalities of one variable, forming their coefficients by separation  main  matrix A diagonal, or  N equalities of two variables, forming their coefficients by separation of two matrix A diagonals  main and next to it from above or below . One can consider the version of three matrix A diagonals separately  main and  two  next .  The  choice  of  the  diagonal  number  in  the  matrix  is  determined  by admissible time for solving the diagonal system equalities using ordinary methods for X 0  calculating the following solution of linear equality systems by a neural network algorithm. As mentioned above numerous times, this procedure is effective for big dimension systems. In this case, the problem is the initial condition choice of weight coefficients in the second, third etc. layers of the multilayer neural network, which solves the system of algebraic equalities in the structure presented on Fig. 11.6a.  During the work, [11-6] a modified approach to neural network algorithms of the solution of algebraic equality systems is offered, which is presented in Fig. 11.6b. Here the neural network input is A matrix and b vector, and output – required X solution. In conclusion, the main problem is, in forming the output signal of neural networks that is found by the first method of algebraic equality system determination, the calculatation of the neural network coefficients, which could content to ratio X 0  = F{W 0 }, where F is the conversion made by the neural network, and  W 0  is the number of initial values of weight coefficients of the neural network by a defined structure.  11.4.2 Linear Inequality Systems  By solving linear inequality systems, the initial condition choice of setting multilayer neural  network  coefficients  is  possible  to  make.  This  is  also  possible  with  a  linear equality system solution with proper signs of inequality substitution in the inequality systems to the signs of equalities.  Fig. 11.6. Initial conditions choice for two variants of investigated neural network algorithms   218  Chapter 11  ·  Selection of Initial Conditions During Neural Network Adjustment  11.4.3 Approximation and Extrapolation of Functions.  It is widely believed that neural networks are mostly effective approximators and extrapo- lators of functions. It is directly connected with the natural development of the theory of filtration and extrapolation signals from linear theory, where the amount of a priori in- formation about useful signals and noises is quite considerable in nonlinear theory. In this connection a neural network machine using the filtration and the signal extrapolation problem includes and summarizes quite a great quantity of attempts to solve the non- linear processing problem by means of other methods. Neural networks solve the filtration and signal extrapolation problems for difficult and unknown characteristics of a useful signal, often variables in time, and variables in time-noise characteristics. In the framework of neural networks are the initial attempts to build multivariable filters and extrapolators. From our point of view, the natural choice for initial conditions of a multilayer neural network  setting  of  equivalent  linear  filter  in  adaptive  approximators  and  function extrapolators is the adaptive filter construction. Linear discrete filter Zadeh Ragozini is a z-filter of an order which is equal to the memory of a filtration or extrapolation system with coefficients that calculate as functions of N memory and extrapolation time á. Because the linear filter is produced based on a priori information about known functional form signal and additive noise to a useful signal, particularly in the form of white noise, a few sets of weight coefficient filters can exist for useful signals of differ- ent complexity and correspondingly calculate with different computational complex- ity. The main problem is to calculate the z-filter coefficients to the appropriate initial coefficients of a neural network of a fixed structure.  11.4.4 Pattern Recognition  At the outset is the problem of choosing initial conditions for an adaptive neural network setting; solving the problem of pattern recognition appeared in the work 11.2]. In this work two methods of choice of mentioned initial conditions are considered: the choice of accidental initial conditions and the choice of determinate initial conditions. The choice of Accidental initial conditions is made because of the secondary optimization functional multi-extreme coupled with the multi-modality of distribution f  x  input signal and limi- tation of the open-ended neural network structure. Accidental elements are introduced into the procedure of the extremum search of the secondary optimization functional because of the necessity of local and global extremum of the mentioned functional search. The necessity of the local extremum search is determined by the necessity to solve the problem of the multilayer neural network structure minimization by analysis of setting results. At the first phase of accidental initial condition use  and the following phase of setting equalization results for a multitude of accidental overshoot phases of initial con- ditions  an impression is made about a great number of local extrema of the secondary optimization functional in space of adjustable coefficients. However because it is neces- sary to mark that with meshing of an open-ended neural network structure, the multi- plicity of multilayer neural network conditions increases, which is estimated by the value of the secondary optimization functional. In other words, the majority of local extremum   11.4  ·  Initial Condition Formation for Neural Network Coefficient Setting in Problems of Optimization  219  functionals in the space of adjustable coefficients ensure the same recognition quality. This remark is necessary to connect with the methods described below of a multilayer neural network quality estimate by the secondary optimization functional value estimated by the current signals in the neural network. Taking into account everything that has been mentioned above, one can mark the accuracy of the approach to the setting using the accidental initial conditions, although this approach obviously introduces the redundancy in the neural network setting time with the intention of input signal full learning  par- ticularly, solving the global extremum functional .  The purpose of determinate initial condition leading is a priori neural network leading into the area of one of the local extrema of the secondary optimization functional in the space of adjustable coefficients. On the geometry level, the first, second etc. multilayer neural network should be maximumly amorphed, distributed, or namely, advanced to solve the most difficult  from the view of f  x   modality of the recognition problem. Thinkable configuration of a shared surface in this case with teaching of recognition of two class patterns is presented in Fig. 11.7, although it is the preliminary version. The final version can be determined only by leading of an amorphous criterion, distribution. Ob- viously that which is smallest amorphed and distributed is a multilayer neural network where all the coefficients of the first layer of neurons are similar, and appropriately dis- criminate surfaces are removed to the edge of the feature space. This is physically realized in the neural network area of the feature space in Fig. 11.7 and is indicated with a dotted line. This also spreads to the self-teaching regime, if the cell belonging in the Fig. 11.7 to one or another class was not pointed out before. Initial conditions for adjustable coeffi- cients of the second layer etc. are estimated by the geometry of the dividing surface, which is realized by neurons of the first layer with specification of the initial feature space areas belonging to one or another class. One of the methods of choosing determinate initial conditions was offered in work [11-2].  In conclusion of this point it is necessary to mark those methods which are used in the initial condition choice that one can sort by the type of information utilization:   cid:1  Accidental initial condition choice without the use of teaching extracts;  cid:1  Determinate initial condition choice without the use of teaching extracts.  Fig. 11.7. Dividing surface with choice of initial conditions: 1 – first class; 2 – second class   220  Chapter 11  ·  Selection of Initial Conditions During Neural Network Adjustment  The means of choosing initial conditions with the use of extracts is connected with the possibility of using the initial coefficient neural network utilization of the neural network with fixed structure of results of teaching neural network with a variable struc- ture [11-2, 11-4].  11.4.5 Clusterization  The first problem is choosing initial conditions for an adaptive neural network setting which resolves the problem of clusterization that was applied in work [11-2]. The natural version of the initial condition choice in the adaptation process in the multilayer neu- ral networks, solving the problem of clusterization, is the construction of the initial dividing surface in the multidimensional feature space as it was shown in Fig. 11.7 without indicating which areas belong to one or another class. Weight coefficients of the first and following neurons are formed based on the geometry of the assumed dividing surface with equal dissection of the multidimensional feature space to the areas which are appropriate to the estimated clusters.  11.4.6 Traveling Salesman Problem  The traveling salesman problem is the particular problem of linear programming at that time when the linear programming problem is the particular problem of optimi- zation together with quadratic and non-linear programming. The traveling salesman problem is solved by finding the shortest route between  N towns when leaving the appointed town and returning back there.  A possible version of the choice of initial conditions, of the initial route while solv- ing the traveling salesman problem is the choice of route, which is logically choosing from the appointed town the nearest one to it, then the nearest to the chosen one, etc.  11.4.7 Dynamic System Modelling  Dynamic system identification using the neural networks is mostly effective in the case of substantially nonlinear systems, systems with variable parameters and structure, and the multivariate and classified systems. In the easiest case of linear systems, the identification is realized by feeding the system of jump signals of every amplitude to the input and solving z-transformation of the transition process. In that case, the model of the system is a z-filter with coefficients of a  z-transition function. In the case of more complicated systems, the initial information specified above of the object one can get, gives to the input the sequence of jump signals of different amplitudes in the range of input signal changes from zero to XBxmax  in the Fig. 11.8 . At the same time, in consequence of the material nonlinear object, the reactions to the different jump sig- nals won’t be linear-contiguous. At the same time, one can use z-transformation of system reactions to the jump input signals of different amplitudes for forming the initial values of coefficients of the first layer of a multilayer neural network, which identifies the ex-   11.5  ·  Typical Input Signal of Multilayer Neural Networks  221  Fig. 11.8. Choosing initial conditions of adaptation in the multilayer neural networks by solving the problem of dynamic systems identification  plored object. The subject matter is still the question of forming the initial values of co- efficients of the consequent layer of the multilayer neural network with full sequential connections, and also the feed-back connection coefficients in the case of utilization of neural network identification for networks with adjustable feedback connections.  11.4.8 Conclusion  The choice of initial conditions for a multilayer neural network setting is an important means of both speeding up the convergence of adaptive algorithms and ensuring the convergence to the global extremum optimization functional. Unfortunately, practi- cally no attention is paid in this matter of the classic computational mathematics to the development of iterative algorithms of complex problem solving. Every current problem in the neural network logical basis  demands its method of forming initial conditions for the adaptive algorithm of the multilayer neural network setting. It will be the matter of developing this research in the future by solving a class of problems, which are solved on the neural network logical basis.  11.5 Typical Input Signal of Multilayer Neural Networks  The selection of some class of typical signals is performed for the objective compari- son of the multilayer neural network quality in the adjustment mode and in the sta- tionary state. This problem is solved in a relatively complete form in the case of the linear systems of automatic control with deterministic and random input signals. The relatively complete class of deterministic input signals is the class of polynomial input signals usually used for the estimation of the control system’s quality. The main char- acteristics of the signal complexity here is the corresponding polynomial exponential order or the distribution fx x  modality. It is reasonable to consider that in the case of self-learning, the distribution of the typical stationary input signal of the multilayer neural network is multimodal with a relatively homogeneous location of distribution fx x  modes in the physically realized pattern space.

Here  r is the complexity of the typical input signal of the multilayer neural network. The variance of each fx x  mode must be chosen in such a way that the modes are sufficiently pronounced.

It is implied that the open-loop neural network structure, the general characteristics of the signal, and the multilayer neural network adjustment algorithm are given. Several problems must be solved for the quality estimation of the closed-loop multilayer neural networks.  The first one is the selection of initial conditions for the adjustment of the multilayer neural network weighting coefficients. Two methods of the initial condition selection are consid- ered: random selection with the averaging of the results across the number of random in- jections and search of all local and global extrema, and a deterministic method with placing the neural network into the region of a global extremum of the secondary optimization functional by means of defining some piecewise linear divisional surface at the initial stage. The second problem is the selection of the typical input signal class for the multilayer neural network for the estimation of their functioning quality in the transient and sta- tionary modes. The complexity of the input signal will be particularly determined by the modality of the conditional distribution f ′ x ε .  The third problem is the selection of the parameter matrix K* in the algorithm of the extremum search for the secondary optimization functional. This problem can be solved analytically and by means of statistical modeling methods. The general analyti- cal methods for the closed-loop neural networks consist of the following steps:  1. Determination of the density of probability distribution for the estimation of the  secondary optimization functional gradient vector;  2. Derivation of the stochastic differential equation for the change of the distribution  density of the adjustable neural network coefficients in the adjustment process;  3. Solution of this equation; 4. Search of the primary optimization functional distribution parameters by means of  integrating over the feature space and over the neural network state space.  With the result of the analysis according to the aforementioned steps and according to the requirement to provide the given quality estimated by the primary functional value, one can solve the problem of synthesis of the neural network adjustment circuit. Notice that the analytical solution of the third step is rather complicated. That is why such methods are illustrated in the present study only by some particular examples. The statistical analysis is considered to be the main one.   224  Chapter 12  ·  Analysis of Closed-Loop Multilayer Neural Networks  12.2 Investigation of the Neuron Under the Multi-Modal Distribution of the Input Signal  12.2.1 One-Dimensional Case – Search Adjustment Algorithm  The neuron with two solutions and with minimization of α 2g was modeled. The block diagram of the modeled system is shown in Fig. 12.1. The possibility of the design of closed-loop systems with the search adaptation procedure was analyzed. The assem- blages of the first and second class patterns have multi-modal distributions. This is the case of the system structure insufficiency. In such a case, the structure complexity is less than the complexity of the solved problem, and therefore the potential recognition quality cannot be achieved in principle.  Figure 12.2 represents distribution densities of the first and second class assem- blages and the dependence of the average density function α 2g upon the threshold a0 in the case when the left neuron indicates the first class region, and the right neuron indicates the second class region.

The estimation of dα 2g da0 was performed by means of averaging across mn realizations of the system input signal. The main aim of the modeling is the estimation of the influence of ∆a0, K*, mn, a0 0  upon the dynamics of the adjustment circuit of the coefficient a0. The results of mod- eling are the following:  1. The search oscillations are suitable for the design of the neural network closed- cycle adjustment block. The higher value of ∆a0 results in the higher precision of the adjustment circuit performance in the stationary state  Fig. 12.3 ;  2. The higher value of K* results in the lower value of the systematic error for the it- eration procedure of the optimal solution search and in the higher value of the random error of this procedure  Fig. 12.4 ;  3.

Consequently, it is necessary to know some a priori information about the quality functional  limi- tation of the search space, expected characteristics of the extrema location, etc.  in order to select the proper search intervals and initial steps of the gradient procedure. Interesting results are obtained in the investigation of the variance value  the level of class quality  on the adjustment process. If the variance is small relative to the distances between modes, then the optimal position of the divisional surface is not significant be- cause the classes do not overlap and the local extrema are not sharp. The experiment with the first class variance being several times greater than the second class variance showed that the optimal divisional hyperplane position shifted to the mode with the smaller variance. This could be expected for the system adjusted by the average risk function.  The stability of the gradient procedure is achieved by the experimental selection of the step value and constraint upon the vector component increments. The component increments could not be more than the fourth part of the distance between local ex- trema, and the learning procedure was smooth.  Fig. 12.11.

The aim of the investigation was the estimation of different system charac- teristics upon the closed-loop adjustment circuit functioning.  The expression for the analogous error of the system has the following form:   12.1   Consequently,  The lines over the expressions mean the averaging performed at the time instant n∆T across the set of implementations of the nonstationary random process. Since we have only one implementation of the nonstationary random process xa n∆T  then the averaging across the set must be substituted by the averaging across the time on the memory interval mn with additional constraints according to the a priori information about the characteristics of parameter changes for nonstationary random process dis- tribution across the memory interval. The most suitable in this case is the representa- tion of the random process in the form of the sum of the stationary process and determin- istic process with known characteristics of its changes in the functional form [12-1].  Since the derivative  cannot be expressed in the algebraic form then let us assume that the value a0 n∆T  is fixed on the averaging interval mn. The change of a0 n∆T  is performed in the adap- tation mode with the cycle equal to the memory mn of the system adjustment block.  Consequently,   232  Chapter 12  ·  Analysis of Closed-Loop Multilayer Neural Networks  The closed-cycle adjustment algorithm has the following form:  In the case of nonstationary patterns, the process xa n∆T  is a nonstationary one with  characteristics  determined  by  the  input  signal  nonstationary  characteristics  Chap. 9 .

The dependence of the following input signal characteristics upon the dynamic of  the closed-cycle adjustable system were investigated:  1. Time course of the pattern assemblage mathematical expectations  the assemblages  of both classes are assumed to be equal ;  2. Level of class intersection determined by the variance equal for both classes under the fixed difference between the mathematical expectations of pattern assemblages of the first and second classes ;  3. Nonstationary level determined in particular by the change rate of the class centers’  coordinates;  4. Memory value mn in the block of the system closed-cycle adjustment; 5. Prediction time α in the block of the system closed-cycle adjustment at the estima-  tion of the secondary functional gradient;  6. Amplification coefficient K* in the block of the system closed-cycle adjustment.  Figures 12.12–12.19 show the time courses of the neuron threshold changes under the linear laws for the changes of the class centers’ coordinates. Two laws with different change rates of these coordinates were used:  2t + 3  and [ 1 2 t + 3]. The distances between class centers is fixed in all the experiments.  Groups of curves I and II correspond to the two aforementioned linear laws. The  data analysis results in the following conclusions:  1. The increase of the memory value mn of the recognition system results in the de- crease of the class intersection level influence upon the adjustment random error; 2. The increase of mn results in the increase of the systematic error in the coefficient  adjustment  Figs. 12.14, 12.15 ;   12.3  ·  Dynamics for the Neural Networks of Particular Form for the Non-Stationary Pattern Recognition  233  Fig. 12.12.

The  adjustment  process  is  unstable  under  the  small  values  of  mn   mn = 5   and K* = –2. The increase of mn up to mn = 20 results in the stable adjustment process. Consequently, the nonstationary pattern recognition systems require the memory in the adjustment block  mn > 1 . The increase of mn compensates to some extent for the lack of the a priori information about K*:  4. The rate of the classes’ center coordinate changes in time does not practically influ-  ence the errors of the adjustment circuit performance;  5. The requirement K* < –1 is necessary for the stability of the adjustment circuit; 6. The characteristic modulation of the enveloping curve for the system threshold  changes under the unstable conditions is observed;  7. The results of the use of the quadratic law instead of the linear law for the classes’ centers’ coordinate changes in time confirm the previous conclusions  p. 1–6 . Under the sufficiently large values of mn, the systematic error changes of the adjustment circuit show some regular relationship  negative for K* > –1 and positive for K* < –1 .  Figures 12.17–12.19 show that the level of class intersection significantly influences the adjustment circuit in the self-oscillatory adjustment process when  K* = –2. The adjustment process diverges under the large values of σ. But under the small σ, the oscillating adjustment process periodically changes its amplitude relatively ideal thresh- old value and at some time moments become rather precise.

The increase of α results in the increase of the random error in the closed-cycle  adjustment circuit;  2. The increase of σ, decrease of m, and fixed α result in the increase of the random  error in the closed-cycle adjustment circuit;  3. The results of comparison between the linear and quadratic laws for the classes’ centers’ coordinate changes in time showed that the random error in the closed- cycle adjustment circuit increased in the former case.  12.4 Dynamics of the Three-Layer Neural Network in the Learning Mode  The considered neural network is supposed to have a continuum of solutions. The first, second, and third neural network layers consisted of 3, 2, and 1 neurons, respectively.

The state of the neural network is determined in the following way. Three neurons of the first layer have respectively the coefficients a10 = –12, a11 = 1, a12 = 1, a20 = 24, a21 = –1, a22 = –1, a30 = –36, a31 = 1, and  a32 = 1. Neurons of the second layer have the coefficients a′ 23 = 1. Neurons of the third layer have the coefficients a′′  21 = 1, a′ 10 = 1, and a′′  20 = 0, a′ 10 = 0, a′′  22 = 1, and a′  10 = 0, a′  13 = 1, a′  12 = 1, a′  11 = 1, a′  12 = 1.  In the experiments, the input feature space dimensionality was N = 2, and the num-  ber of modes f  x  was 4.  Experiments with the first neuron layer  the second and the third layers are optimal . The conditions in each experiment were the following:  Fig. 12.20.

The following results were obtained. Figures 12.21–12.23 illustrate the coefficient adjustment procedure.

Ex- periment 1-1 confirms the stability of coefficient values in the optimal state  small deviations of their values from the optimal one at the sufficiently large number of it- erations . In experiments 1-2 and 1-3, the gradient procedure provides such an adjust- ment that the divisional surfaces reach the optimal position after 25–30 iterations.  Fig. 12.21.

The initial conditions provided the optimal positions of the surfaces realized by the neurons of the first, second, and third layers in such a way that the “inverse” classification took place. The adjustment resulted in the parallel shifts of the planes, though the rotation by 180  is also possible. The divisional planes realized by the neurons of the second and third layers are drawn through the origin of coordinates, i.e., only the rotation of these planes around the origin of coordinates is possible in the adjustment procedure. Therefore, the experiments with the neurons of these layers included the adjustment of coefficients for the planes turned through 180 . Figure 12.23 shows coefficient adjustment dynamics in experiments 2-2 and 3-1. The adjustment procedure resulted in the turn of the hyperplane realized by the neurons of the third layer through 180 , thus taking an optimal position. After the adjustment of the third layer neurons, the coefficients of the first layer neurons also take the optimal values. The results of the performed experiments confirmed the theoretical analysis of the investigated adjustment algorithm and demonstrated its high efficiency. The following wide range of problems remains to be analyzed:  1. Selection of the optimal coefficients K in the gradient procedure and their relation-  ship between multilayer neural network layers;  2. Analysis of the influence of the multilayer neural network structure redundancy  upon the adjustment quality.  12.5 Investigation of the Particular Neural Network with Backward Connections  We consider here a one-dimensional neuron with the feedback described by the fol- lowing relationships:  where ∆T  is  the  time  interval  between  the  presentation  of  the  input  patterns.  The minimum α 2a criterion is taken as the criterion of the secondary optimization. It is assumed that the coefficients α k do not change in the interval of averaging mn during the closed-cycle adjustment. The expressions for the α 2a gradient estimation have the following form:  0 and α   12.4    12.5   The expressions  12.4  and  12.5  form the base for the design of the corresponding closed system. The averaging of the gradient measurements was performed with the help of the optimal discrete filter. The a priori hypothesis about the change of the input signal mathematical expectation  stationary, linear, quadratic, etc.  was used for its synthesis.   240  Chapter 12  ·  Analysis of Closed-Loop Multilayer Neural Networks  Fig. 12.24.

At the sufficiently large value of the system memory in the adjustment block  about mn = 20 , the change of a0 and ak has the form of oscillations. At the decrease of the memory value  to about mn = 5 , the oscillations of the adjustment process for the coefficient ak sharply increase, and for the coefficient a0 – decrease;  Fig. 12.27.

The systematic error of the coefficient a0 adjustment increases as the system memory increases or at the introduction of the feedback into the open-loop structure of the system. The adjustment systematic error for the total neuron threshold is practi- cally zero. This is an advantage of the neural network with feedback over the neural network without feedback;  4. The decrease of the coefficient K*  1 in the iteration procedure for the adjustment of the feedback gain results in the approximation between characteristics of the neu- ron with the feedback to the neuron without feedback.  12.6 Dynamics of One-Layer Neural Networks in the Learning Mode  Three types of the neural networks in the self-learning mode are considered below: the neural network with the search of the distribution mode centers f  x ; the neural network in the form of the neuron layer with two solutions; the neural network in the form of the neuron with Kp solutions.  The main goal of the study is the quality estimation of the developed algorithms  when the input signal x n  has the arbitrary modality distribution.  12.6.1 Neural Network with the Search of the Distribution Mode Centers f x   The self-learning algorithm realizing the following recurrent relationship  Chap. 9    12.6   is considered. The algorithm consists of the following stages:   12.6  ·  Dynamics of One-Layer Neural Networks in the Learning Mode  243  1.

Then the external cycle is locked on p. 1. The random input signal x n  distribution is the sum of the normal distributions with the given variances and mathematical expectations equal to 2, 4, …, 16. The number of distribution modes f  x  was fixed from 2 to 8.  Figure 12.30  shows  the  typical change of  class center coordinates  b xk,n   in  the adjustment process for some variant of the random initial conditions. The algorithm functioning results are represented in Tables 12.1 and 12.2. In the tables, i is the num- ber of mode in the distribution f  x , Z is the modality of the distribution f  x , and j is the number of cycle for the injection of the random initial conditions  b xk,0  in the extremum R search. Table 12.1 was calculated at Kp = 5, M = 300  the number of itera- tions by n , and K* = 0.02. For each σ here, the number of distribution f  x  modes found for each  j is given in the right column. The number of modes found during all the previous cycles is given in the left column. The similar data are represented in Table 12.2 for Z = Kp, K* = 0.01, M = 100, and σ = 0.5. The analysis of the obtained results shows the following:  1. The algorithm is efficient at the solution of a rather complex self-learning task; 2. The experimental results confirm theoretical conclusions  Chap. 9  concerning the  expected local and global function extremum search;  3. The increase of σ results in the decrease of the algorithm functioning quality under  the fixed Z, Kp, K*, i, j.  The considered algorithm was slightly modified  the set of initial conditions in terms of class center coordinates was substituted by the set in terms of coordinates of the initially presented Z patterns . The respective quality increase is illustrated by the data shown in Table 12.3. Here the number of distribution modes obtained at each A-th step of the initial condition injections and the total number of distribution modes obtained during the total number of A steps are represented.

Experiments  with  different  distribution  dispersions  representing  f  x   modes  2. Coefficients of the second layer neuron and the classes’ center values are optimal.  The following different conditions were taken for the first layer neurons: a Neuron coefficients were optimal; b Initial values of neuron coefficients were taken with equal deviations from the  optimal ones;  the optimal ones.  c Initial values of neuron coefficients were taken with different deviations from  3. The second layer neuron coefficients were optimal; then they were similar to p. 2a,  2b but with the initial classes’ center values that were not optimal;  4.

Similar to p. 3 but with initial classes’ center values that were not optimal; 6. The first and second layer neuron coefficients and classes’ center values were not optimal; 7. All the aforementioned experiments were performed under different but determinis- tic initial conditions. The final experiment was based on the random initial conditions for neuron coefficients and the classes’ centers.   12.7  ·  Two-Layer Neural Network in the Self-Learning Mode  253  Experiment p. 1a showed the stability of the two-layer neural network in the global extremum of a special average risk function.

It is seen that the selected location of the input signal distribution density modes makes the hyperplanes  I, II, III, IV  insensitive to the ro- tation. The quality functional is almost constant here, and this fact is confirmed ex- perimentally. It is therefore advisable to investigate only the dynamics of the threshold aij adjustment  j = 1, 2, 3, 4  under the given fixed f  x  mode location and, as a rule, not to investigate the dynamics of the hyperplane coefficients.  Figure 12.39 shows the results for the case when the initial coefficients of the second layer neuron were optimal but the initial values of first layer neuron coefficients and the classes’ centers were taken with equal negative deviations from their optimal val- ues.

The goal of the experiment p. 6 was to investigate the influence of the distribution dispersion upon the recognition quality. The initial conditions in this experimental series were the same, whereas the dispersion σ2 was different  Fig. 12.42 .  These experiments show that the self-learning problem can be solved for σ2 not more than σ2 max = 1.5. This is reasonable because it is impossible to select locally con- centrated objects under the large σ2  classes with a large intersection . Hence, the self- learning methods based on such a selection appear to be invalid under such conditions. Figure 12.43 shows the experimental results for the case when the initial coefficients of the first layer neuron classes’ centers were optimal but the initial values of the sec- ond layer neuron coefficients were not optimal.

This matrix in the simplest case is a unit matrix multiplied by some constant or time-dependent coefficient. However, as the   258  Chapter 12  ·  Analysis of Closed-Loop Multilayer Neural Networks  above experiments have shown, there are some reasons to make this coefficient differ- ent for the adjustment of different layers of the multilayer neural network. As it was mentioned in Chap. 9, the main goal of the use of stochastic approximation methods is to provide the zero random and dynamic errors in determination of the adjustment coefficient vector in the stationary state. But the use of such methods results in the increase of corresponding dynamic errors in the transient state, i.e., in the adjustment mode. It is unlikely that it is necessary to provide the zero random error in the station- ary state during the multilayer neural network adjustment. Some finite adjustment coefficient distribution dispersion is admissible due to the relatively smooth proper- ties of the secondary optimization functional in its extremum point. This finite disper- sion of distribution fa a  does not result in the significant increase of the secondary optimization functional, and it can be provided by the time-invariant matrix K*. Two engineering methods are possible in this case for the selection of the matrix K* coef- ficients. The first one is based on the analysis of the a priori given problem complexity determined by the modality fx x  under the fixed dimensions of the feature space.  The second method based also on the analysis of experiments shows that the objec- tive necessity to estimate the secondary optimization functional emerges in the real situation during the multilayer neural network adjustment process. If the dependence of the secondary optimization functional upon n strongly oscillates, then it is neces- sary to decrease K*. If this dependence is sufficiently smooth, then it is necessary to increase K* in order to decrease systematic adjustment error up to the emergence of oscillations. The first method for selection of K* can be used for selection of the initial value of K* in the second method.  12.9 Design of the Multilayer Neural Network for the Matrix Inversion Problem  Let us consider the design of the multilayer neural network and its closed-cycle adjust- ment algorithm for matrix inversion when its dimensionality is 2 × 2. Since the result also represents some matrix 2 × 2 then the multilayer neural network output must consist of four neurons with a continuum of solutions. The minimum variant of the open-loop three-layer neural network structure is shown in Fig. 12.46 in the form of a graph-scheme. The initial conditions on the adjustment coefficients of the first layer neurons must be selected in such a way that under B = ∝, four hyperplanes must divide the initial  Fig. 12.46.

The initial condition selec- tion for the second and third layers must be performed in a similar way as in the case of the first layer because the neurons with a continuum of solutions are also used here. The formation of the learning sample for the considered multilayer system is car-  ried out according to the following expressions:  There are practically no constraints upon the amplitude of the multilayer neural network input signal. But the amplitude of the output signal is limited by the interval [–1, + 1] due to the output neurons’ specific character. This requires some normaliza- tion of the input signal in such a way that all the output signal components do not exceed the interval [–1, + 1]. Such normalization must be performed in the following way. Let X be the initial matrix and  Division of  X by x gives the  matrix  X–1 with elements belonging to the interval  [–1,  + 1]. Let us designate  Then  Consequently, the multiplication of matrix X elements at the input by 1 xD1 and the  following application of this matrix to the inversion system provide the matrix  with elements inside the interval [–1, + 1]. Multiplication of this matrix by 1 xD1 gives the final result X–1.  The structure of the open-loop multilayer neural network is described by the fol-  lowing relationships:   260  Chapter 12  ·  Analysis of Closed-Loop Multilayer Neural Networks  The teacher instruction ε  h3 for the multilayer system must be formed in the algorith- mic way using one of the known matrix inversion algorithms and inversion precision control. The expressions for the mean-root-square error of the elements of the matrix  have the following form:  Here  These expressions form the basis for the design of the adaptation algorithm of the  multilayer system aimed at the inversion of matrix 2 × 2.   12.10  ·  Design of the Multilayer Neural Network for the Number Transformation  261  12.10 Design of the Multilayer Neural Network for the Number Transformation from the Binary System into the Decimal One  The transformation of the four-bit binary number will be considered as an example.

We considered below the case K = 2 and arbitrary objective teacher qualification b0.  The pattern recognition system represented a two-layer neural network based on the neurons with arc tangent characteristics and B = 5. The adjustment algorithm was modeled in the learning  bc = 1  and self-learning  bc = 0  modes. The algorithm block diagram is represented in Fig. 12.47.  The main aim of the experimental study was to test the system operation capability.  The plan of experiments included two main points:  1. The investigation of the system behavior under the optimal coefficient values and  different relationships between b0 and bc;  2. The investigation of the system dynamics for different b0 and bc and non-optimal  neurons.  The pseudo-random-number generator with the distribution close to the normal one and with equal covariance matrices for both classes was used as the generator of the input signals. The experimental study showed the following results concerning p. 1:  Fig. 12.47.

The system remains in the optimal state in the case bc = 0 independently of b0.  The investigations under the non-optimal initial coefficients showed that in the case b0 = bc, the adjustment procedure leads the system into the optimal state. In the case bc = 1 ≠ b0, the system is not adjustable in spite of the long adjustment duration  Fig. 12.48 . and bc  12.12 Analytical Methods of Investigations of the Neural Network Closed Cycle Adjustment  We describe below the general analytical methods for the investigation of the closed- cycle neural network adjustment. The particular examples are used for illustration. The complications of the described methods are discussed.  The general methods of analysis of the closed-cycle neural network adjustment are similar by its structure to the methods used for the analysis of the open-cycle adjust- ment. They include the following stages:  1. The analysis of the probability distribution density for the vector of the secondary  optimization functional gradient estimation;  2. The derivation of the stochastic differential equation for the change of the adjust-  able coefficient distribution density in the course of the adjustment procedure;  3. The solution of this equation; 4. The determination of the probability distribution for the correct recognition by means of integrating across the feature space and across the neural network state space  the space of the adjustment coefficients .   264  Chapter 12  ·  Analysis of Closed-Loop Multilayer Neural Networks  In principle, the problem of the parameter matrix K* selection must be performed according to the results of p. 3. However, it will be shown below that this task is rather complicated.

The stochastic difference equation for the change of the probability distribution density of the threshold a0 has the following form:  The third stage of analysis. The solution of this stochastic difference equation is rather difficult. Let us consider the stationary state  n = ∝ .  Taking a0 0  = 0 and proceeding to the limit n → ∝ one obtains  Consequently,   12.12  ·  Analytical  Methods  of  Investigations  of  the  Neural  Network  Closed  Cycle  Adjustment  265  It follows from the normalization condition for the distribution density of coeffi-  cient a0 by m that W mK*  = 0.

It follows from  12.13  that the mathematical expectation and distribution disper-  sion of the threshold are finite.  For the neuron with arbitrary memory mn in the adjustment block  mn = const, N = 1 ,   12.15   The expression  12.15  is valid in spite of the remark made in Chap. 9 about the impossibility to design the analytical adjustment algorithm with arbitrary values of mn in the general case with the minimum α 1g criterion and the system with two so- lutions. This is explained by the fact that the expression  12.15  concerns the particular one–dimensional case  N = 1  with x0 = –1= const. The coefficient adjustment in  12.15  is performed after each mn cycle of patterns entering the system input.  The expression for the transfer probability in the given Markovian chain is similar  to the case mn = 1:  where mK* is the current value of the adjustment coefficient a0.

Such a walk is described by the multidimensional Markovian chain. The analysis of the closed- loop system here consists in the derivation of expressions for the transition probabili- ties, derivation of the stochastic equation, and investigation of its solution.

However, the probability of correct recognition is restricted in the former case by the neural network structure fixation.

These hyperplanes form the resultant hypersurface up to the achievement of the required recognition quality or some other condition for the learning process termination. The learning process is reduced to the formation of the logical tree. Geometric interpretation is the following. The feature space is optimally divided into two parts by some fixed structure neural network. Then the obtained subspaces are divided again, and so on.  Fig. 13.1.

Then regions Φ  12 are obtained after partitioning of Φ  that θ 1 by the hy- perplane. Then θ 12 are calculated and the recognition errors are compared. If θ 1 > θ 12, then the introduction of the new hyperplane improves the recognition quality. In this case, the sample L1 is divided into sub-samples L11 and L12. Then the pro- cess is repeated. As a result, one obtains the set of regions Φ i,j,k,…,t, where indexes i, j, k,…, t take the values 1 and 2.

If the error does not decrease at the given number of steps, then the initial region Φ i,j,k,…,t is excluded. The following rules for the algorithm termination are considered in [13-1]:  1  Termination at the given value of the error probability;  2  Termination at the given value of the hyper- plane number  the number of neurons in the first layer . The block diagram of the pro- gram realizing the algorithm of the piecewise linear divisional surface drawing is shown in Fig. 13.5. Let us describe the operators that are not clear from the previous description.  Operator “Logical tree”. As it is seen in Fig. 13.4, the tops of the tree are of two types: intermediate tops and terminations. The tree root is the knot with index 0, and termina- tions correspond to certain pattern classes. Each pattern x after the pass of the operator “Logical tree” enters one of the terminations. Function ϕ i,j,k,…,t x  is used for making a decision about further movement direction from the top i, j, k,…, t. If ϕ i,j,k,…,t x  ≥ 0 then the movement is to the right branch and vice versa. The logical tree in Fig. 13.4a takes the form shown in Fig. 13.4b under the sequential numeration of the tree tops. The logical tree is convenient for describing the following with the three-column matrix:  The s-th row of matrix C corresponds to the s-th top of the logical tree. The matrix rows, similar to the tops, are of two types. The row  0 s s + 1  describes the intermedi- ate top of the tree. One takes the divisional surface ϕ s = 0 corresponding to this top, and the transfer to the top s is performed if sign ϕ s = 1. If the row has the form  k 0 0 , where k = 1,2, then it describes one of the tree termi- nations. If the point xj appears in such a point after the sequential use of several divi- sional surfaces, then it belongs to the class Ak. The drawing of the new hyperplane ϕ i x  results in the appearance of two new tree branches going from the top i. Matrix with U rows obtains two new rows  U + 1  and  U + 2  of the following form:  s = –1 or to the top s + 1 if sign ϕ  U + 1: 1 0 0  U + 2: 2 0 0  0 U + 1 U + 2  and the i-th row gets the record  i.e., the i-th top now becomes the intermediate top of the logical tree.   13.2  ·  Learning Algorithm for the First Neuron Layer of the Multilayer Neural Network  277  Operator “Drawing of a new divisional surface” can use any neuron adjustment algo- rithm described in Chap. 9. It can realize any fixed structure neural network described in Chap. 9 and 10.  Operator “Quality improvement estimation” is used for the recognition quality improve- ment estimation. The results of its application are used for the logical tree design: the improvement of the quality leads, for example, to the division of the region with the highest value of the average risk function. In the opposite case, the division of the lastly obtained regions takes place.  13.2 Learning Algorithm for the First Neuron Layer of the Multilayer Neural Network Using the Method of Random Search of Local and Global Function Extrema  This algorithm was designed on the basis of methods described in Chap. 8. One can ignore in this case the tree structure design, and all the neurons providing local ex- trema of the average risk function are included in the first layer  Figs. 13.6, 13.7 .  Four hyperplanes in the two-dimensional feature space shown in Fig. 13.6 deter- mine four local extrema of the average risk function. Figures inside the circles corre- spond to the numbers of the logical function arguments in each region of the multi- dimensional feature space. Table 13.1 gives the logical function values in the example shown in Fig. 13.6. Tick marks correspond to the values that are not defined at the given argument values. Zero index corresponds to the regions without patterns.  Fig. 13.6.

Multi-extremum  property of the average risk function under multi-modal distribu- tions f  x ε    278  Chapter 13  ·  Synthesis of Multilayer Neural Networks with Flexible Structure  It is evident that deterministic search methods do not provide the local extremum overrunning. The solution is the introduction of the random elements into the search procedure.  The main algorithm stages are the following:  a The adjustment coefficient vector components of the current neuron are randomly  b The next local extremum of the average risk function is found by some neuron learn-  selected;  ing method;  c This extremum is recorded if it was not found earlier.  The transfer to the first stage is performed after the termination of the third one,  and the adjustment coefficient vector of the next first layer neuron is determined.  The experimental investigation of one performance cycle of such a learning algo- rithm for the first layer neuron was described in Chap. 12. Figure 13.8 shows the block diagram of the program that realizes this algorithm.  The plan of experiments with this program was aimed at the analysis of the learn- ing process properties. The input signal characteristics and the adjustment algorithm were similar to those described in Sect. 12.2. The following characteristics must be analyzed:  1. The experimental estimation of the random procedure convergence; 2. Dependence of the total calculating time on the feature space dimensionality N, number of extrema U, and step value ∆. The learning procedure is performed until the sequential random initial condition injection results in the search of all the quality functional local extrema under the given modality of the distribution functions of the input signal. The number of the random search steps required for the search of all the local extrema is given in Table 13.2, where U is the number of the desired extrema, and η U is the number of the random procedure steps required for the search of all the U extrema. The approximate estimations for the mathematical expecta- tion and variance of the step number have the form  8.16a .  Table 13.2 and the data described in Sect. 8.6 provide the estimation of the total learning time under the particular modality of the input signal. This time increases linearly with the feature space dimensionality increase.   13.2  ·  Learning Algorithm for the First Neuron Layer of the Multilayer Neural Network  279  Fig. 13.8.

Illustration of the process for the increase of the error prob- ability at some step of the sequential algorithm perfor- mance: I – the first class; II – the second class  13.3 Analysis of Algorithm Convergence under the Hyperplane Number Increase  The algorithm convergence under the neural network structure complication depends on the rules for the selection of the sub-region for partitioning and the learning algorithm at each partition step. The method described above of the selection of the sub-region for partitioning is optimal by the algorithm convergence rate. The simplified methods of the feature space sequential partitioning usually used in practice and consisting in the neu- ron open-cycle adjustment using the initial learning samples moments often result in the increase of the error probability at some step of the algorithm performance  Fig. 13.9 . The non-shaded area in Fig. 13.9 corresponds to the next partition region, and the divisional surface is drawn perpendicular to the line linking the centers of two classes. The error at this partition step increased because some patterns of the first class ap- peared to be classified as second class patterns. To provide the stable decrease of the error probability, one must use the closed-cycle adjustment with the second discrete error distribution moments α 2g minimization at each procedure step. This provides the minimum number of the first layer neurons. However, it is sometimes necessary to increase the number of the first layer neurons voluntarily at the expense of the sharp simplification of the neuron learning algorithm.  The increase of the hyperplane number in the most unfavorable case results in the error probability estimation convergence to zero due to the finite learning sample length.   13.3  ·  Analysis  of  Algorithm Convergence under the Hyperplane Number  Increase  281  Fig. 13.10. The analysis of algorithm convergence under the hyper- plane number increase on the learning and recognition stages  Fig. 13.11. Formation of the learning sample at the first layer neu- ron output  Two stages of the neural network design therefore exist: the algorithm learning stage and the algorithm precision estimation stage. At the sample length equal to M, only its minority part M1 is used for the algorithm learning. The trained algorithm is then used for the recognition performance on the sample part M2 = M – M1, and the real algo- rithm  precision  is  estimated  by  the  recognition  probability  error  Pp H1 . Function ∆Pp H1  = Pp H1  – P0 H1  shown in Fig. 13.10 must in principle increase with the in- crease of the hyperplane number due to the decrease of the algorithm capability for generalization. Here P0 H1  is the function of the error probability change on the neu- ral network learning stage. Function Pp H1  often has a local minimum under the given finite value of H1, amounting, for example, to H′ 1. It is recommended to use namely this number H′  1 of hyperplanes if Pp H′  1  satisfies the initial conditions.  The particular result of the first layer neuron learning in the case of the multilayer neural network with two solutions is the logical function that determines the sequence of multidimensional feature space partitioning. This logical function is sometimes not defined not only on the complete sets of arguments but on some separate arguments. The simplest illustration of underdefiniteness of such a kind of logical functions is represented in Fig. 13.11 and Table 13.3. The Roman numerals indicate the initial re- gions of the feature space for the formation of some set of the logical function ε y  arguments. The cells marked by the tick marks indicate variable sets that never appear at the output of the first neuron layer. The cells marked by the sign ⊕ indicate the variable values out of the complete set of 2H1 values that also never appear at the output of the first neuron layer. The procedure of the sequential partitioning shown in Fig. 13.11   282  Chapter 13  ·  Synthesis of Multilayer Neural Networks with Flexible Structure  can be illustrated by the tree and matrix with the form represented in Fig. 13.12. Here I–IV are the regions obtained as a result of the sequential partitioning.  The problem of the extension of a definition of the logical function ε y  emerges in connection with the necessity to form the arrays of the learning vectors at the output of the first layer neurons required for the adjustment of the following neuron layers. The main problem here is to extend the logical function definition onto the partially given sets of its arguments. The definition extension onto set 8  Fig. 13.11, Table 13.3  is not necessary because this set never appears in this particular task of the piecewise linear divisional surface design. The definition extension is carried out in the following way. Vectors with existent coordinates, initial teacher instruction, and complete sweep- ing across the absent variable values are recorded in the learning array for the second layer neurons of the multilayer neural network represented in Table 13.4.  The logical function for the adjustment of all the neuron layers except the first one  is formed in Table 13.4.  Fig. 13.12.

If the result of this test is negative, then the transfer to the synthesis of a three-layer neural network must be performed.  Figure 13.13 is the illustration of the logical function realizability using one neuron. Here, the value of the neuron output analogous signal g n  is less than zero across all sets of the input binary variables y z   z is the number of the set  of the first class and less than zero across all sets of the input binary variables of the second class. The value ∆g = g 2  max is termed “interval” [13-5]. The necessary and sufficient condition for the logical function realizability using one neuron can be written in the following form:  min – g 1   The summation of the first members and second members of equations  13.1  gives the condition for the logical function realizability using one neuron in the following form:   13.1    13.2    13.3   or in another form  The expressions  Fig. 13.13.

Similarly to [13-5], let us introduce the expression   13.4    13.5    13.6   Expressions  13.3  and  13.4  give  Notice that  or  function ε y  realizability.  The expression  13.5  gives the necessary and sufficient condition for the logical Let the logical function ε z  determined in Z points of H1-dimensional binary ar- gument  y z  not be realizable using only one neuron with the weighting coefficient vector a. The scalar product of vector a and characteristic vector of the logical function is less than the sum of absolute values of the neuron output analogous signal across all z = 1,…, Z. Consequently, the weighting coefficient vector of the neuron realizing the given logical function with characteristic vector b must minimize  to zeroth value  the following functional:  Vector b is to some sense close to the weighting coefficient vector a of the neuron  realizing the logical function that corresponds to b. The difference  can be regarded as an error of the logical function realization [13-5]. Then the mean- root-square error is minimal at c = b. Consequently, the corresponding vector b can sometimes be taken as a weighting coefficient vector a realizing the logical function. However, in general, vector b cannot be always taken as vector a.   13.4  ·  Learning Algorithms for the Second Layer Neurons of the Two-Layer Neural Network  285  The expression  13.5  is similar to the expression  13.2 . The latter one can be repre- sented as a system of linear inequalities and the former one as a nonlinear equation. The use of  13.5  is slightly simplified because the initial logical function ε y  defined in 2H1 points of H1-dimensional space of binary  –1, 1  variables is represented in  13.5  by an H1-di- mensional analogous vector, whereas in  13.2  it is represented by 2H1 binary numbers.  13.4.2 Synthesis of a Neuron by the Functional Minimization Method  The aforementioned correspondence between  13.2  and  13.5  indicates the advantages of  13.5 . However, the complexity of the explicit expression for the nonlinear term  emerges here. This complexity can be overcome by the use of the appropriate approxi- mation. According to  13.6 , the minimized functional has the following form:   13.7   Here c is the arbitrary weighting coefficient vector that provides a non-zero analogous error of the neuron; b is the characteristic vector of the given logical function. The follow- ing condition is assumed at the determination of the vector providing a minimum of  13.7 : either vector a = c is the weighting coefficient vector realizing the given logical function, or the given logical function cannot be realized with the use of only one neuron. Figure 13.14 shows conditionally the dependencies of summands in  13.7  upon ci for realizable and non-realizable logical functions with the use of only one neuron: 1 – physically realizable logical function; 2 – non-realizable logical function.

General form of the quality functional for physically real- izable and non-realizable logi- cal function with the use of only one neuron   286  Chapter 13  ·  Synthesis of Multilayer Neural Networks with Flexible Structure  The described synthesis method for the second layer of the multilayer neural net-  work is based on the following representation:  qg z  ≈ ξ  2[q2g2 z ] + ξ  4[q4g4 z ] + …  where q is the normalizing factor limiting the approximation region in the following way: 1 ≤ qg z  < 0. The approximation of qg z  by k terms is the k-th order approxi- mation.  In the case of k = 1,  g z  ≈ ξ  2[qg2 z ]  Consequently,  or  The sum  is totally determined by the given logical function  by its argument values  and can be calculated before the neuron synthesis solution. The same is valid for its characteristic vector. The following expression is valid for the whole set of arguments of the logical function defined in 2H1 points of H1-dimensional space of binary  –1, 1  variables:  where δ ij is Kronecker symbol. This expression is not valid in the general case of the multilayer neural network synthesis. In this particular case, taking into account  13.8 , one obtains   13.8    13.9    13.4  ·  Learning Algorithms for the Second Layer Neurons of the Two-Layer Neural Network  287  In the general case,  If  13.9  takes place, then   13.10   The expression for the optimal vector c providing minimum I 0  has the following form: ≈ Pibi  ci  where  The realizability of the logical function using one neuron is invariant with respect to the multiplication of ai by the constant coefficient. Then the expression for the de- sired weighting coefficient vector realizing the logical function with the characteristic vector b under condition  13.8  has the following form:  ≈ bi   ,     i = 0, ... H1  ai   13.11   It is seen therefore that at the first-order approximation under the condition  13.8 , the weighting coefficient vector is equal to the logical function characteristic vector. If in this case the first-order approximation doesn’t appear to be valid, then one usually assumes  ≈ bi   ,      only for     i = 1, ... H1,  ai  and the value a0 is varied for providing the possibility to realize the logical function using only one neuron  see an example below . In the general case, when  13.8  is not valid  and the desired weighting coefficient vector is calculated according to the equation  a = D–1b  This is the main expression for the neuron synthesis by means of the functional minimization at the first-order approximation. Matrix D–1 and vector b are calculated by the initial values of the realized logical function. The calculation of a0 is similar to the case of the validity of  15.8 .   288  Chapter 13  ·  Synthesis of Multilayer Neural Networks with Flexible Structure  Example. Let the divisional surface configuration be the same as that which is shown in Fig. 13.15.  Table 13.5 gives the values of the logical function of four variables. The tick mark indicates the argument values that do not participate in the formation of the initial piecewise linear divisional surface. The values of the binary input variables are ordered by the increase of the corresponding decimal numbers z. The full set of the logical function values is realized by the following transformation:  ε= x1x3 + x3x4 + x1x2x4  The logical function characteristic vector is  Fig. 13.15. Illustration of the synthesis of the second layer neurons in the two-layer neural network by method of the functional minimization   13.4  ·  Learning Algorithms for the Second Layer Neurons of the Two-Layer Neural Network  289  In the considered example, b0 = –2, b1 = 6, b2 = –2, b3 = 10, and b4 = 6. It is easy to check that these neuron coefficients provide the realization of the initial logical func- tion using this neuron. However, in the case of the first-order approximation, the ad- ditional variation of coefficient b0 is required. Using the calculated coefficients bi and  13.11  for i = 1,…, Hi, one obtains the following value  Table 13.6 :  The sweeping of the neuron threshold  b0 = a0  values is performed per unit in the  interval [B z max – 0.5]÷[B z min + 0.5].  The method of the neuron synthesis by means of the functional minimization and first-order approximation at the incomplete variable set determined by the divisional surface form  Fig. 13.16, Table 13.7  can be illustrated in a similar way.  Consequently, the general procedure for the neuron synthesis by the method of functional minimization includes the following stages  step by step with dependence on the logical function realizability :  1  determination of the characteristic vector b;  2  determination of the threshold b0;  3  the use of the second-order approximation, etc. It is evident that the described method of the neuron synthesis is equivalent to the usual neural network synthesis methods with open-cycle adjustment and input signal high-order moment consideration. In the described method, at the first-order approxi- mation, the characteristic vector is the vector of the divisional surface drawn in the middle between the centers of two classes.  Fig. 13.16.

Neuron synthesis by the threshold function tables [13-5] is based on the use of the logical function characteristic vectors. This method allows one to obtain the neuron optimal parameters in the case when the one-neuron logical function realization is possible [13-5]. The method of the neuron synthesis by the threshold function tables can be used when the first-layer neuron number is not more than seven. The process of design of the characteristic vector tables and corresponding weighting coefficient vectors of the second-layer neuron is described in detail in [13-5]. The procedure con- sists in the following steps:  1. Vector b determination; 2. Formation of the decreasing sequence of bi values  i = 0,…, H1  and checking its presence in the corresponding table. If it is absent, then the given logical function is not realizable by one neuron, and the synthesis procedure is terminated;  3. If the sequence in the table is found, then the given logical function is realizable by one neuron. The weighting coefficient vector a can be found in the following way. Write out sequence ai related in the table to sequence bi. Then make the replacements and sign changes of ai in the precise correspondence with those made in vector b for its canoni- cal representation in the table. The obtained sequence of H1 + 1 elements ai =  i0,…, H1  represents the weighting coefficients of the neural network second-layer neuron.  13.5 Learning Algorithm for Neurons of the Second and Third Layers in the Three-Layer Neural Network  The training of the second and third layers in the three-layer neural network in the case when the first layer is adjustable is equivalent to the independent learning prob- lem for the two-layer neural network with binary input signals. This section deals with two kinds of neural network design: design in the form of a threshold-disjunctive neural network [13-5] and in the form of two neuron layers with adjustable coefficients.  The initial data in the case of the threshold-disjunctive neural network synthesis is the completely defined logical function ε y , and the synthesis is performed in the following order:  1. Execution of the Kwine-McKlaski procedure over the ε y  function until all its prime  implicants are obtained;  2. Find all common intersections  centers of gravity  of two or more prime implicants and combine into wyes the prime implicants that have a common center of gravity; 3. Find characteristic vector of each wye, and check these wyes’ realizability using one  neuron  use any method described in the previous chapter ;   13.5  ·  Learning Algorithm for Neurons of the Second and Third Layers in the Three-Layer Network  291  4. Find all possible sub-wyes for each wye that cannot be realized using one neuron. The sub-wye is defined as the wye subset that can be realized using one neuron and that is not a subset of any other wye;  5. Add wyes and sub-wyes from p. 3, 4 to the list with prime implicants realizable by  one neuron and mark the sets covered by each record from this list;  6. Select the minimum number of records covering all the units of the logical function ε y . The linear threshold elements that realize these records constitute either the first layer of the threshold-disjunctive network or the tandem network [13-5] equiva- lent to this threshold-disjunctive network.  The method of the sub-wye search includes the following procedures:  1. Determine all the implicants that have the intersection with the center of gravity of  the considered wye;  2. These implicants together with the prime implicants are considered thereafter in all possible combinations, their characteristic vectors are calculated, and then the test on their one-neuron realizability is performed.  This method appears to be rather complex when the number of prime implicants is  large. One can use therefore another method for the sub-wye search:  1. If the wye that cannot be realized by one neuron consists of the prime implicants, then one must consider all the groups of these prime implicants  G–1 implicants in each group  and test each group on its one-neuron realizability;  2. If at least one of such groups is one-neuron realizable then this wye is two-neuron  realizable without its further partitioning;  3. If all the groups are not realizable by one neuron then the procedure must be re-  peated but with  G-2  prime implicants in each group;  4. The described process continues until all the prime implicants are spent. The ob-  tained one-neuron realizable groups are the desired sub-wyes.  The synthesis procedure in the case of a nonstrictly defined logical function ε y   consists of the following steps:  1. Extend a definition of the logical function ε y  to all the variable sets where it takes  the arbitrary values;  2. Perform the process of the threshold-disjunctive network synthesis described above for the case of a completely defined logical function until it is discovered that all the wyes and sub-wyes are one-neuron realizable;  3. Compose the table of prime implicants with the number of rows equal to the num- ber of wyes, sub-wyes and prime implicants obtained at the second step of the syn- thesis procedure, and with the number of columns equal to the number of logical function ε y  sets. Thus, all the arbitrary values of ε y  are taken equal to  –1 ;  4. The minimal table record set covering all the units of ε y  is selected. At that point, the definition extension of its arbitrary values is automatically performed. Then the synthesis process is terminated.   292  Chapter 13  ·  Synthesis of Multilayer Neural Networks with Flexible Structure  The design of two output neural network layers in the form of a neural network with  adjustable coefficients can be carried out on the basis of the following considerations.  The feature space in this case is binary, and the space dimensionality is equal to the number of the first-layer neurons. Therefore, training of the second-layer neurons in the three-layer neural network can be performed using any method described in Sects. 13.1 and 13.2. Then, after the second-layer neuron learning termination, the logical-tree struc- ture of the third layer can be tested on its realizability by one third-layer neuron.  13.6 General Methods of the Multilayer Neural Network Successive Synthesis  The methods described above of successive adjustment of the three-layer neural network can be generalized for the case of multilayer neural networks in the following way:  1. The first neuron layer of the multilayer neural network is adjusted by the initial samples.  The number of neurons and the values of adjustment coefficients are selected;  2. The  one-neuron  realizability  of  the  obtained  logical  function  is  checked.  In  the  positive case, the network synthesis is terminated;  3. In the negative case, the second-layer neurons are trained according to p. 1. The  number of neurons and the values of adjustment coefficients are selected;  4. The one-neuron realizability of the obtained logical function is checked…, and so  on similar to p. 2.  It is simple to generalize this technique for the neural network with a solution con- tinuum. Here, the number of first-class and second-class patterns is preserved at the transfer from one layer to another. The multilayer neural network quality criterion is not only the correct recognition probability at the neural network output but also the function of this probability change during the transfer from one layer to another.  The results of the application of the described technique for the multilayer neural network synthesis are the neural network layer number, the number of neurons in each layer, and the adjustable coefficient values. It must be mentioned that the described method of the multilayer neural network learning allows one to train any structure considered in Chap. 9 instead of one neuron at each learning step.  The successive adjustment procedure can be simply generalized for the self-learn- ing mode. The optimization criterion for the next hyperplane drawing in this case is the criterion of the specific average risk function minimum.  13.7 Learning Method for the First-Layer Neurons of a Multilayer Neural Network with a Feature Continuum  This section deals with the learning algorithm for the first-layer of a multilayer neural network with a feature continuum and the ways of its physical realization. The pecu- liarity of the learning process for the multilayer neural networks with a feature con- tinuum emerges at the first-layer neuron training. The expressions for a i -functions and coefficients a0 in the simplest case have the following form:   13.8  ·  Application of the Adjustment Algorithm of the Multilayer Neural Networks  293  a i  = m1 i  – m2 i   If x1 i,n  and  x2 i,n  are the sets of patterns of the first and second classes, then  functions m1 i  and m2 i  are  The implementation of functional transformations described above can be  per- formed using photographic methods in the case of two-dimensional i. The result of learning in this case are photomasks realizing functions an i  that model the light flux x i,n , see Chap. 4, and coefficients a0.  In the case of one-dimensional i, at the recognition of curves or electrical signals inside a fixed observation interval, functions an i and coefficients a0 can be sufficiently and simply obtained by analogous facilities.  The sequential learning technique for the neuron with a feature continuum remains  the same as in the case of the discrete feature set.  13.8 Application of the Adjustment Algorithm of the Multilayer Neural Networks with Flexible Structure for the Problem of Initial Condition Selection  Figure 13.17 shows the block diagram of the program realizing the process of sequen- tial design for the piecewise linear divisional surface at the initial condition selection. The idea of its application for the initial condition selection at the closed-cycle learn- ing procedure of multilayer fixed structure neural networks is discussed below. The fixed structure of the multilayer neural network imposes constraints upon the number of neurons, at least in the first layer, and the algorithm can diverge. Therefore, the use of statistical methods for the calculation of the error recognition probability is neces- sary. However, this can be ignored at the initial condition selection procedure. There is a possibility to improve the divisional surface position after the algorithm termination by means of a sequential closed-cycle adjustment of each neuron with the learning quality test for the whole piecewise linear surface. The closed-cycle adjustment must × M iterations, where H1 is the number of the first- be performed 2H1 times, i.e., 2H1 layer neurons, and M is the sample length. It is useful to decrease the sub-sample size up to some optimal value.  One of the methods to design such an optimal sub-sample is the deterministic se- lection of K  or 2K, 3K, etc.  patterns each belonging to one of the K pattern classes. In the case of the ultimate decrease of the sample size, one transfers to the deterministic or  random  selection  of  initial  conditions  in  dependence  of  respective  presence  or absence of a priori information.   294  Chapter 13  ·  Synthesis  of  Multilayer Neural Networks  with  Flexible  Structure  Fig. 13.17.

Then the multi- layer neural network is trained to recognize two pattern classes:   cid:1  The first class represents the initial sample;  cid:1  The second class represents an artificially generated random sample with the uni- form probability distribution function in the range of feature variation. The feature space dimension for the samples of the first and second classes are equal.  Literature  [13-1] Galushkin AI  1970  Multilayer pattern recognition systems.

The existence ap- proaches to this solution and description of so-called structural methods based on the multilayer neural network pattern recognition systems synthesis [14-1, 14-2] are discussed in this book.  Three statements form the basis of the proposed method:  1. The usual idea about the possibility of a preliminary informative feature selection before the stage of multilayer neural network adjustment is incorrect because the trained multilayer neural network already presents, explicitly or implicitly, in any known selection procedure;  2. Only the primary optimization criterion accepted for the given system can serve as a criterion of feature informativity. Any other criteria usually introduce additional errors and restrict their domain of applicability;  3. It is necessary to select multilayer neural networks of such types that are the most objective in the informative feature selection procedure, i.e., that provide the op- timal solution in the sufficiently wide variation range of the multilayer neural net- work input signal characteristics  number of classes, distribution complexity in- side the classes .  The problem of the informative feature selection was initially stated as the problem of selection of N1 = const. features out of N initial features. These N1 selected features are supposed to provide minimum recognition probability error. This problem state- ment can be interpreted in another form: selection of minimum feature number N1  Fig. 14.1. Selection of informative features in the initial feature space   296  Chapter 14  ·  Informative Feature Selection in Multilayer Neural Networks  Fig. 14.2. Classification of methods for the informative feature selection  providing a given probability of correct recognition. Let us determine in this case the feature informativity criterion. Suppose that NN0, NN1 and NN2  Neural Network  with corresponding numbers of features N = N1 + N2, N1 and N2  Fig. 14.1  provide the prob- abilities of correct recognition P, P1 and P2. If P1 > P2 then the group of N1 features is more informative than the group of N2 features. In this case, if the increment ∆P = P – P1 of the correct recognition probability is sufficiently enough to cover the expenses re- lated to the system complexity increase due to the addition of N2 features, then the use of the group of N2 features is useful.  Such a problem statement for the informative feature selection is used in a wide range of practical tasks. For example, in some particular task of feature informativity estimation; the analysis of correct recognition probability Pcorr can be performed for four feature groups:  x1,…, xN ,   x1,…, xN  ∩ xi ,   x1,…, xN  ∩ xj , and   x1,…, xN  ∩  xi, xj  . * features out of N We considered that such a particular problem as the selection of N1 ones for the achievement of maximum correct recognition probability cannot be solved without a solution in the statements described above.  In  the  particular  case  of  a  multilayer  neural  network  with  full  connections,  the problem consists in the minimization of the number of threshold elements in each layer. Further, the minimization criterion described above is also valid. Both aforemen- tioned statements for the problem of informative feature selection are combined in the general structural approach to the this problem when the first layer is considered to be a priori organized in the form shown in Fig. 14.1.  Figure 14.2 shows the block diagram illustrating methods of informative feature selection in connection with the considered above problem statements and informa- tive feature selection criteria.   14.2  ·  About Structural Methods for the Informative Feature Selection in the Multilayer Networks  297  This block diagram represents only the main ways of the considered solution, and it does not pretend to be complete, but it is only aimed at the introduction of the struc- tural methods for the informative feature selection. The main development relates to divergence, conditional entropy, and some of their simplified estimations. They also include the approaches based on the component analysis and analysis of variance.  The main goal of the present chapter is the consideration of structural methods for the informative feature selection. They are based on the feature informativity estima- tion by the results of the multilayer neural network adjustment. At the solution of the adjusted multilayer neural network structure minimization, the minimization method depends on the adjustment method.  14.2 About Structural Methods for the Informative Feature Selection in the Multilayer Neural Networks with Fixed Structure  The structural methods of the informative feature selection are based on the initial feature space informativity estimation by parameters and structure of the optimally adjusted multilayer neural network. This section illustrates the structural methods for the informativity estimation in the example of a neuron.  Let us consider the multilayer neural networks of one neuron type or a neuron with a layer of nonlinear or random-nonlinear transformations  Chap. 1 and 2 . The mul- tilayer neural network in the form of one neuron is optimal for the pattern assem- blages with normal multidimensional distribution laws and equal covariance matrices. In the case of the unit  to an accuracy of constant multiplier  covariance matrices, the level of class intersection by each of the features is determined by the corresponding inclination of the optimal linear divisional surface  Fig. 14.3 .  The circles in Fig. 14.3 indicate the isolines of the densities  f1 x  and f2 x . If the main feature informativity criterion is the correct recognition probability as it was considered above, then it is easy to show that the i-th coefficient of the optimal divi- sional surface can serve as the relative estimation of the i-th feature informativity.  Fig. 14.3. The proof of the possibility to use the neuron coefficients as the feature informativity esti- mations   298  Chapter 14  ·  Informative Feature Selection in Multilayer Neural Networks  The coefficients of the optimal neuron can also serve as the estimation of the fea- ture informativity in the case of abnormal distributions. But it can be done only on the level of such an open-loop structure as a neuron. In the case of abnormal distributions and  a  nonlinear  multilayer  neural  network,  the  neuron  coefficients  in  the  optimal nonlinear network represent the complex feature informativity estimations determined by the nonlinear transformation layer. A similar conclusion can be made for the three- layer Rosenblatt perceptron.  The structure minimization at the multilayer fixed structure neural network adjust- ment algorithm and the set of adjustment stages with random selection of initial con- ditions represent a separate problem. It includes the necessity to average the results of the adjustment procedure across the set of random initial condition injections. These injections are required for the local optimal adjustable coefficient search. The com- parison of the minimized structures and the local optimal average risk function pro- vides a direct rule for minimization of the number of neurons in the fixed structure multilayer neural network adjusted by the closed cycle.  It is necessary to consider distinctly the problem of minimization of the neuron number in the independent learning procedure for each neuron with the random ini- tial condition selection separate for each neuron. After the independent training ter- mination for H1 neurons of the first layer, and, as a result, search of the local optimi- zation functional extremum, the problem of selection by the adjustment results for one of the H1 neurons that provides the optimization functional extremum value becomes 0 < H1 neurons that provide the optimization trivial. The problem of selection of  H1 functional extremum is rather complicated and maybe unsolvable in such a statement. This is illustrated by the example shown in Fig. 14.4. Here the error probability value is indicated in percents for each threshold selection. The numeric characters near the arrows indicate the class number.  Fig. 14.4. Example of minimization of the first-layer neuron number in the multilayer neural net- work: 1 – the first class; 2 – the second class   14.3  ·  Selection of the Initial Space Informative Features  299  Fig. 14.5. Illustration of the local optimality property of the informative feature selection procedure: 1 – the first class; 2 – the second class  This approach reveals its limitations in its generalization for the case of unknown and complicated form of distribution  f ′ x ε . However, this limitation is completely explained taking into account the impossibility to select the informative features be- fore the adjustment stage termination. Figure 14.5 illustrates this property in the par- ticular example. The isolines of f ′ x ε  in the multi-modal case and four positions of the piecewise linear divisional surface providing the local extremum Pcorr are shown here. Consequently, any informativity estimation at the fixed structure of the open-loop multilayer neural network is not only subjective but is also local because the adjusted multilayer neural network with fixed structure provides only a local optimization func- tional extremum. These arguments are also valid in the case of the self-learning mode.  14.3 Selection of the Initial Space Informative Features Using Multilayer Neural Networks with Sequential Algorithms of the First-Layer Neuron Adjustment  The main problem consists in the possibility to estimate the relative value of the cor- rect recognition probability by the trained neural network structure form and the results of learning. Two feature groups are compared. Several methods of feature informativity can be proposed.  1. Let us assume that the given value of Pcorr = const. is provided  in particular, Pcorr = 1  using multilayer neural networks with sequential learning algorithms of the first- layer neurons and some finite learning sample. Then, if the first neural network with characteristics N1, P1corr has a higher number of neurons than the second neu- ral network with characteristics N2, P2corr = P1corr,then the group with N1 features is less informative as compared with the group of N2 features. This method of estima- tion is valid only under some conditions described below.  2. Let us assume that the minimal recognition error is provided at each step of the first layer learning procedure. The learning results are represented in Fig. 14.6a by the curves of Pcorr vs. the number of the first-layer neurons H1 on the feature samples N1  NN1  and N2  NN2 . It is seen that feature group N1 is less informative than N2. This method includes that which is described in p. 1 as its particular case.   300  Chapter 14  ·  Informative Feature Selection in Multilayer Neural Networks  Fig. 14.6. Selection of informative features using a multilayer neural network with flexible structure  3. Dependence Pcorr H1  has the form shown in Fig. 14.6b when the learning sample is sufficiently large. The curve Pcorr H1  is close to its asymptote. This means the trans- fer from the statistical mode to the deterministic one. The informativity estimation is reduced to the comparison of the steady values of Pcorr H1 .  4. Fig. 14.6b,c shows the general case of a non-optimal adjustment algorithm for the first-layer of neurons of the multilayer neural network. The informativity estima- tion in this case is performed either according to p. 3 or at any H1 but with the re- mark that this estimation is valid for the given adjustment algorithm and the given number of the first-layer neurons.  5. It was assumed above that the learning sample is the same as the initial sample. In order to take into account the case when the representation of the learning sample in the initial sample is smaller, one must perform the learning procedure on some part ∆Mi of the initial sample. The recognition by the trained multilayer neural network is carried out on the full sample. The analysis of the learning Plearn H1, ∆Mi  and recognition Precogn H1  results that are illustrated by Fig. 14.6d allow one to es- timate the stationary properties and representativity of the learning sample, as well as informativity of different feature groups.  14.4 Neuron Number Minimization  The adjustment sequence process for the first-layer neurons of the multilayer neural network  Chap. 13  is described by the graph in the form of the logical tree. Each top of the tree corresponds to a neuron and an increment Pcorr that takes place after the   14.4  ·  Neuron Number Minimization  301  introduction of this neuron. Such a graph represents the initial information for the aforementioned minimization procedure. This graph can be minimized according to one of the following statements: to minimize the number of tops under the given Pcorr, or to provide maximal Pcorr under the given number of tops.  Figure 14.7 represents an illustration of the initial information for the graph mini- mization. The top number of the initial graph is indicated at the left part of the circle. The top number of the resultant minimized graph is indicated at the right part of the circle. The number of each graph rib coincides with the number of the divided region  Chap. 13 . The sub-region containing the maximum number of vectors of the first and second classes is selected for the next division. The dashed lines correspond to the sub- regions with a relatively small number of vectors. The corresponding increment Pcorr  either positive or negative  is written near each graph top in the square brackets. The logical tree optimization is performed in the following way:  1. The increments Pcorr are compared in the case of the first branching  neurons 3 and 8 in the initial graph . The neuron with maximum Pcorr is selected for the optimized graph  neuron 3 in this case ; 2. Then the neurons of the given and the next branchings are compared by ∆Pcorr  neu- rons 8 and 4  and again the neuron with maximum Pcorr is included into the opti- mized graph;  3. The process continues until the sum of correct recognition probability achieves some  given value Pcorr or the number of tops achieves some given value.  The described procedure results in the optimal tree traversal as it is shown in Fig. 14.7a in the circles  tops  from the right. Figure 14.7b presents the result of optimization of the graph in Fig. 14.7a for two criteria: Pcorr > 0.7 and Pcorr > 0.73. The course of tree traversal in the optimal graphic design does not coincide with that on the learning stage.  Fig. 14.7. Minimization of the first-layer neurons of a multilayer neural network with flexible structure   302  Chapter 14  ·  Informative Feature Selection in Multilayer Neural Networks  The idea of the use of sequential algorithms for the second-layer neuron learning consists in the use of sequential algorithms for each learning vector with consideration of the weight determined by the Perr in the sub-region corresponding to this vector. The principle of the number minimization for the second-layer neurons as well as for the neurons of the following layers is the same in this case as for the first-layer neurons. Notice that the significance of the neuron number minimization decreases with the increase of the layer number due to the specific properties of the open-loop multilayer neural network structure  decrease of the neuron number due to the data compression from the first layer to the output .  14.5 About the Informative Feature Selection for Multilayer Neural Networks in the Self-Learning Mode  All the problem statements for the informative feature selection described in Sect. 14.1 are valid in the self-learning mode. Only the informative feature selection criterion is modified. In the learning mode, such a criterion is the value of the average risk func- tion  in particular, the correct recognition probability  whereas in the self-learning mode this criterion is the value of the special average risk function. The methods of the informative feature selection described in Sect. 14.3 concerning the learning mode and recognition systems with flexible structure, as well as concerning corresponding methods of the network structure minimization can be methodologically generalized in a relatively simple manner for the case of the self-learning mode. The structure minimization for the recognition system with fixed structure must be performed by means of the analysis of the adjusted multilayer neural network structure as well as the analysis of the obtained value of the special average risk function.

I.   Chapter 15  Neural Network Reliability  15.1 Methods for the Neural Network Functional Reliability Investigation  The first attempts to estimate the neural network functional reliability were experi- mental [15-1] or qualitative [15-2]. The qualitative estimations showed that the neu- ron-like elements are characterized by the logical redundancy [15-2, 15-3], i.e., the failures of some elements do not result in the errors at the neural network output.  The attempts of the analytical neural network reliability investigation face math- ematical  difficulties. Some  works  [15-4  to  15-6]  claim  the  impossibility  of  the  full analytical neural network investigation. Several particular neural networks were con- sidered in these studies and analyzed on the basis of the Markovian process theory by means of graphic design. The disadvantage of such an approach is related to the pres- ence of the system of differential equations that is very complicated for the explicit solution even in the case of the simplest graphs.  The work [15-7] deals with the neural network reliability in the sense of its logical stability. The logical stability is investigated with the help of stability maps that can be written in the explicit form only for the simplest neural networks such as the threshold element triplet. This approach cannot be used in practice.  In the study [15-7], some empirical expressions for the specific neural networks with several constraints on their complexity were derived. But the calculations per- formed according to these expressions cannot simulate the objective estimation of the reliability functional for the considered threshold element networks.  The attempt to investigate the reliability of one neuron taking into account that its weighting coefficients and input values are random is performed in [15-9 to 15-12]. The authors failed to obtain an analytical result even in the simplest considered case. These studies are characterized by several disadvantages: all the analytical calculations were based on the experimental data and extrapolated neuron probabilistic relay func- tion  PRF ; some intermediate results, for example, the PRF mathematical expectation in [15-7], were obtained by means of additional simplifications because of their math- ematical  complexity;  the  final  expression  can  be  integrated  only  using  numerical methods. However, we consider this investigation as the most successful analytical investigation of the neuron reliability because it takes into account the neuron func- tional structure and the probabilistic model of its functioning.  Thus, one can conclude that analytical investigation of the multilayer neural net- work reliability must be based on the principally new approach, or this reliability must be studied experimentally by means of Monte Carlo methods.   306  Chapter 15  ·  Neural Network Reliability  The reliability of the so-called generalized threshold element is analytically inves- tigated in [15-13]. The originality of such an approach relates to the fact that any combi- national network of neurons  multilayer neural network with sequential or cross [15-14] connection  can be realized in the form of a neuron layer. Since the functional reliabil- ity of the neuron layer can sometimes be reduced to the reliability of one neuron, then the analysis investigation in this case is principally significant.  The experimental investigation of reliability can be performed on three levels: cir- cuit, functional, and logical. Functional and logical levels are considered in [15-4, 15-5]. The  neuron  failures  are  usually  divided  [15-15]  into  two  classes:  parametrical  and catastrophic failures. The parametrical failures are caused by the gradual changes of weighting coefficients and threshold under the influence of the external factors  sup- ply voltage or temperature changes, components aging, etc. . The catastrophic failures are caused by disconnection faults or short-circuit failures.  Experimental methods of the parametrical failure investigation are based on the assumption that the weighting coefficients and thresholds of all the neurons are the random values with normal probability distributions. The distribution parameters are considered to be known and to be modeled by the Monte Carlo method. Such an in- vestigation technique allows one not only to analyze a wide class of multilayer neural networks and make resumptive conclusions, but also to estimate the parametrical re- liability of particular implementations.  It is clear that the multilayer neural network’s functional reliability investigation is not complete without catastrophic failure analysis. A special technique for such analy- sis was developed and used to study failures of the logical constant type at the neuron input-output  input-output stuck-at faults . The analysis is based on the successive modeling of stuck-at faults of all types for each neuron and the following calculation of the failure-free performance probability. Such an approach allows one to reveal “poten- tially dangerous” failures that result in the drastic decrease of the failure-free performance as compared with the other failures. The obtained results can be used for eliminating the possibility of “potentially dangerous” failures in the design planning stage.  The developed experimental technique for reliability investigations allows one to obtain some quantitative characteristics of multilayer neural network reliability and provides the practical possibility to perform reliability investigations of concrete neu- ral network implementations.  15.2 Investigation of Functional Reliability of Restoring Organs Implemented in the Form of Multilayer Neural Networks  The problem of reliability of digital devices implemented on any basis and particu- larly on the basis of multilayer neural networks is of great interest at this time due to the complication of computers and functions performed on their base. This problem is of special significance for computers functioning in a nonrestorable mode  for ex- ample, on-board computers , i.e., without access to reparation performance.  After the foundational work of von Neumann [15-16], the synthesis of reliable digi- tal devices made of unreliable elements was investigated by different researchers. The works [15-17 to 15-21] must be specially mentioned in this connection. The proposed   15.2  ·  Investigation of Functional Reliability of Restoring Organs  307  Fig. 15.1. Classification of methods for redundancy introduction  methods are based on the introduction of some logical redundancy into the digital device construction. The redundancy can be classified [15-22] as hardware  structural, [15-23] , temporal and informational. Such a classification is conditional because the redundancy of any of these types is usually accompanied by redundancies of other types. The classification represented in Fig. 15.1 is carried out according to the redun- dancy properties to increase the system reliability.  The hardware redundancy can be used at any functional level beginning from com- ponents up to the whole system. Three types of hardware redundancy can be imple- mented according to the activity of the main and redundant components [15-24]: static [15-25], dynamic [15-4], and hybrid [15-2, 15-26, 15-27].  In the case of static redundancy, all the components, main and redundant, are func- tioning. Overcoming the failure effects is performed automatically by the error correc- tion at the expense of redundancy in the system components.  In the case of dynamic redundancy, the redundant devices start functioning only under the requirement to substitute the failure units. This redundancy provides the system self- restoration. It requires the use of testing and diagnostic methods for failure detection. The hybrid redundancy is the combination of static and dynamic redundancies. Some duplicated devices are permanently functioning. The failure of one of them re- sults in its substitution by the redundant device.  The following main peculiarities of the static redundancy are usually distinguished:   cid:1  Error correction without interruption of functioning;  cid:1  Correction of errors that occurs as a result of permanent failures as well as short-  duration failures;   cid:1  Significant increase of the failure-free performance probability of the low-reliable  devices at the expense of the low redundancy level;   cid:1  Significant advantages of the static redundancy are the universality and the absence of necessity to develop special software for detection, localization and correction of errors.   308  Chapter 15  ·  Neural Network Reliability  The scheme of the majority redundancy [15-17, 15-28] is often used for the static redundancy design. It implies the n-fold duplication of components or units, and the outputs of backup units are loaded by the restoring organ [15-17, 15-29]. The restoring organ realizes the following decision rule in the case of majority voting: its output is equal to the value that is accepted by the majority of the restoring organ inputs.  The dependence of the restoring organ free-failure functioning probability upon the type of decision rule is investigated. Different restoring organ schemes implemented in the form of multilayer neural networks are considered. Accessible regions of param- eter variation for the restoration of organ optimal functioning are discussed.  15.3 Investigation of Multilayer Neural Network’s Functional Reliability  Methods of investigation of multilayer neural network’s functional reliability can be classified as analytical and experimental ones. Analytical investigation at the level of the neuron deals with mathematical complexity. Consequently, the main attention is paid to the experimental investigation of multilayer neural network reliability  see Sect. 15.4 below . The main results described below are represented in [15-30, 15-33 to 15-36].  The multilayer neural network class with binary inputs is considered. The investigation  of multilayer neural network’s functional reliability is based on the following settings:  a Functional reliability criterion; b Probabilistic model of the neural network functioning; c Set of the input values.  The correct multilayer neural network functioning probability and the output signal probability distribution function are considered below as a functional reliability criterion. The probabilistic model of the neural network functioning depends on the physical essence of the considered failure types  parametrical, catastrophic . For example, in Sect. 15.4, parametric failures are considered, and the weighting coefficients and thresh- olds of all the neural network elements are assumed to be random.  It is useful to divide the experimental investigation into several stages according to the number of neuron failure classes. The neuron failures are usually divided into two classes [15-15, 15-37]: parametric and catastrophic ones. The experimental investiga- tion is therefore divided into two stages: the investigation of reliability for parametrical failures  parametrical reliability  and the investigation of catastrophic failures  cata- strophic reliability .  The experimental technique was developed for the class of neural networks with se- quential connections. It allows one to analyze the neural networks with an arbitrary num- ber of inputs, arbitrary number of neurons in the layers, and arbitrary number of layers. The parametrical failures of neurons [15-15] include the errors at the neuron outputs caused by the gradual changes of weighting coefficients and threshold under the influ- ence of the external physical factors: temperature changes, supply voltage changes, etc. Experimental methods of the parametrical failure investigation using the Monte Carlo  method  include  the  normal  probability  distribution  modeling  for  weighting coefficients and thresholds.   15.4  ·  Investigation of the Neural Network’s Parametrical Reliability  309  The catastrophic failures include the failures caused by disconnection faults or short- circuit failures. The failures of such a type can be reduced to the failures of the logical constant type  const. = 0 and const. = 1  at the neuron input-output [15-37]. It is as- sumed that the neuron failures are random, independent, and equally probable. The deterministic choice of the failure type and the number of the failure neuron is per- formed at the catastrophic reliability investigation. The considered approach allows one to reveal “potentially dangerous” failures that result in the drastic decrease  with respect to some a priori given value  of the failure-free performance.  The obtained concrete values of the correct recognition probabilities can be used for eliminating the possibility of “potentially dangerous” failures in the design plan- ning stage. The advantage of the developed experimental technique for reliability in- vestigations consists in the fact that it allows one not only to analyze a wide class of multilayer neural networks and to make resumptive conclusions, but also to estimate the reliability of particular implementations.  15.4 Investigation of the Neural Network’s Parametrical Reliability  Several logical function implementations and two- and three- layer neural networks with a different number of neurons in the first layer were considered in the investiga- tion of the neural network’s parametrical reliability. The following objectives were pursued in the experimental study:  1. To  analyze  parametrical  reliability,  i.e.,  the  correct  probability  dependence  on variance D[a] of the weighting coefficients and thresholds, at different fixed shifts of mathematical expectation –∆a for different one-neuron realizations of some logi- cal function; to find an optimal realization on the base of this analysis;  2. To analyze the change of correct recognition probability with the change of vari-  ance of the weighting coefficients and thresholds with dependence on:  a The increase of the first-layer neurons in the two-layer neural networks; b The increase of the first-layer neurons in the three-layer neural networks; c Transfer from the two-layer to the three-layer neural network realizing the same  logical function and fixed number of the first-layer neurons;  d Transfer from the two-layer to the three-layer neural network with the same total  number of neurons.  The stages of the performed investigations are described below.  Stage 1. The optimal realization selection by the maximum parametrical reliability criterion is shown in the example of three different majority votes. Each neuron real- izes some hyperplane crossing a unit N-dimensional hypercube  N is the number of neuron inputs  and separating two vertex classes:  1  vertexes with the unit compo- nent number less than  N 2 and  2  vertexes with the unit component number more than N 2  the zero component number is less than N 2 . Let us choose a neuron with unit weighting coefficients out of all of the neuron set realizing the majority decision   310  Chapter 15  ·  Neural Network Reliability  rule. Their corresponding hyperplanes are parallel and cross the coordinate axes un- der 45 . The majority element that determines the majority rule is usually chosen in this case, and it satisfies the following equation:  ∈ {0,1} are the input values and a0 =  N – 1  2 is the threshold of the majority   15.1    15.2   This realization is the limiting case for the threshold decrease because  15.2  is not  where xi element  valid at  where ε is an indefinitely small value. The hyperplane corresponding to the majority element for the case n = 3 is shown in Fig. 15.2.  Here and below, the criss-crosses indicate the input and intermediate values corre- sponding to the unit output, and the circles indicate the values corresponding to the zero output. A realization limiting the threshold increase of the considered family of neurons is a neuron with the threshold  N + 1  2 described by the expressions  15.1  and  15.2 .  Figure 15.3 shows a hyperplane corresponding to such a realization for N = 3. Therefore, let us investigate neurons with unit weights and thresholds from the interval [ N – 1  2,  N + 1  2]. Three neurons with the thresholds  N – 1  2,  N + 1  2, and N 2 were taken for the experimental study.  Fig. 15.2. Hyperplane realized by the majority el- ement in the space of inputs  a'0 =  N – 1  2   Fig. 15.3. Hyperplane realized by the neuron with unit weights and the threshold  N + 1  2 in the space of inputs   15.4  ·  Investigation of the Neural Network’s Parametrical Reliability  311  Since the change of the weighting coefficient mathematical expectation shift –∆a indicates some hyperplane shift and rotation, then the investigation of the three afore- mentioned realizations for different ∆a results in the determination of the optimal realization for the arbitrary ∆a. The experiment was performed for three values of the mathematical expectation shifts: ∆a = 0.15; 0.0; –0.15. The average experimental curves are represented in Fig. 15.4a–c.  Fig. 15.4. Average curves for correct recognition probability de- pendence upon the variance of weighting coefficients in the case of three realizations of one neuron: a ∆a = 0; b ∆a = 0.15;  c ∆a = –0.15   312  Chapter 15  ·  Neural Network Reliability  Fig. 15.5. Hyperplane realized by the optimal neuron  Variance D[a] is measured in the same units as for the weighting coefficients. It is seen that the correct recognition probability decreases in general with the variance increase. In Fig. 15.4a, at ∆a = 0, the optimal realization is the realization of the neuron with the threshold  a0 = 1.5. In Fig. 15.4b, at ∆a = 0.15, the optimal realization is the realization of the neuron with the threshold  a0 = 2. In Fig. 15.4c, at ∆a = –0.15, the optimal realization is the realization of the neuron with the threshold  a0 = 1.0. The averaging of all corresponding correct recognition probability values across realiza- tions for three values of ∆a shows that the neuron with the threshold a0 = 1.5 repre- sents an optimal realization for arbitrary ∆a. Thus, one can make a general conclusion for the case of the optimal neuron with the threshold a0 = N 2, and, consequently, with the thresholds  N – 1  2 at ∆a > 0 and  N + 1  2 at ∆a < 0. The value ∆a for the real neurons can be either positive or negative. The optimal neu- ron realization in this case corresponds to the hyperplane equidistant from the symmetri- cal points of both classes, i.e., the hyperplane drawn through the middles of the corre- sponding hypercube ribs. This hyperplane position for N = 3 is represented in Fig. 15.5. The following conclusion can be made on the basis of the obtained results. Each hyperplane must be drawn through the middles of the corresponding hypercube ribs at the multilayer neural network synthesis on the binary input signal set. Then the neurons and the neural network possess maximal parametrical reliability with respect to all other possible realizations. Only such optimal neural networks with optimal neurons are considered at all the following stages.  Stage 2. Let us consider six different neural networks with two,three,…,seven neu- rons in the first layer. All the neurons realize the optimal hyperplanes according to the results obtained at stage 1.  Figure 15.6 shows one of such realizations  two-layer neural network with  H1 = 2 j is the output value of i-th neuron of j-th layer.

The obtained results show that the parametrical reliability is constant when H1 in- creases and variance is small: 0 ≤ D[a] ≤ D*[a]  D*[a] ≅ 0.6 . The probability increases with the increase of H1 in the case D*[a] ≤ D[a] ≤ 2. This probability increase is espe- cially stressed at H1 = 6.7.

Let us consider five different neural networks with three, four,…,  seven neu- rons in the first layer, two neurons in the second layer, and one neuron in the third layer. All the neurons realize optimal hyperplanes. The parametrical reliability curves for H1 = 3,5,7 are represented in Fig. 15.8.  On the basis of the obtained curve analysis, one can make a conclusion similar to that made at stage 2: three-layer neural networks are characterized by the increase of the parametrical reliability with the increase of H1.  Stage 4. This investigation stage deals with the problem concerning the change of parametrical reliability at the transfer from the two-layer neural network to the three- layer neural network that realizes the same logical function under the fixed value of H1. The previously obtained results at stages 2 and 3 can be used in this case. The corre- sponding comparative characteristics for two- and three- layer neural networks with H1 = 3, 5, 7 are represented in Figs. 15.9–15.11.  It is seen that the transfer from the two-layer neural network to the three-layer neural network results in the decrease of the parametrical reliability. For demonstrativeness, in addition to the aforementioned curves, the curve for one neuron realizing the same logical function is represented in Fig. 15.9. One can make a conclusion that the in- crease of the number of layers results in the decrease of parametrical reliability.   15.4  ·  Investigation of the Neural Network’s Parametrical Reliability  315  Fig. 15.10.

Let us consider all possible two- and three-layer neural networks from the assem- blage that was described above. The total number of neurons in these neural networks is assumed to be equal. There are only three such pairs: with six neurons  3 + 2 + 1 and 5 + 1 , seven neurons  4 + 2 + 1 and 6 + 1 , and eight neurons  5 + 2 + 1 and 7 + 1 . The corresponding curves are represented in Fig. 15.12a–c. One can conclude that the two- layer neural network possesses the highest parametrical reliability.  The performed experiments allow one to make the following conclusions:  1. The correct recognition probability decreases with the increase of variance of the weighting coefficients and threshold at the fixed mathematical expectation shift; 2. The neuron possesses maximal parametrical reliability when the hyperplane real- ized by this neuron is drawn through the middles of the corresponding hypercube ribs;  3. Neural network parametrical reliability increases with the increase of the number of neurons in the first layer in the case of both two- and three-layer neural net- works;  4. The transfer from the two-layer neural network to the three-layer neural network realizing the same logical function with the same number of neurons in the first layer results in the decrease of the parametrical reliability;   316  Chapter 15  ·  Neural Network Reliability  Fig. 15.12.

The number of neurons at the fixed number of the neural network inputs.  15.5 Investigation of the Multilayer Neural Network’s Functional Reliability in the Case of Catastrophic Failures  The experimental methods for investigation of the multilayer neural network func- tional reliability in the case of catastrophic failures consist in the successive modeling of the single-fold failures of the logical constant type at the neuron inputs and outputs and calculation of the correct recognition probability value for each failure.   318  Chapter 15  ·  Neural Network Reliability  Let us describe the process of the “potentially dangerous” failure search on the basis of the network catastrophic reliability investigation and methods of the network logi- cal redundancy determination.  The results of the investigation are represented in Table 15.1. They indicate that on the failure class of the logical constant type at the neuron’s input-output, under the failure equal probability, the analyzed network possesses the logical redundancy coef- ficient of 6 46, i.e., at six failures out of 46 possible ones, the correct recognition prob- ability amounts to 1. One can also select “potentially dangerous” failures taking the minimum acceptable value of the correct recognition probability. Let it be equal to 0.75. Then only eleven “potentially dangerous” failures having the correct recognition probability of 0.375 exist. For example, const. = 1 at the output 1 of the first layer neu- rons; const. = 1 at the input 1 of the second layer neurons, etc.  Thus, the experimental study of the neural network catastrophic reliability allows one to take into account and to use the logical redundancy for eliminating the possi- bility of “potentially dangerous” failures. This can significantly increase the reliability of the designed logical devices.  Literature  No. 3, vol. EC-13  [15-1] Coates CL, Lewis PM  1964  DONUT-a threshold gate computer. IEEE Trans.

ASU 3:56–61   Chapter 16  Neural Network Diagnostics  The introduction of dynamic redundancy into the structure of digital devices for re- liability improvement requires the development of technical diagnostics of failures that occur in the structures implementing these devices.  Such diagnostic methods proposed in several works can be divided into two groups: methods of diagnostics and control of separate neurons at the level of separate functional components  multiplier, adder  and methods of diagnostics of neural networks at the level of separate neurons. The algorithms of the first group are described in detail in [15- 15, 15-37, 16-1 to 16-4]. The authors made a complete classification of neuron failure types and developed synthesis algorithms for tests of neuron failure control and localization to an accuracy of the input-output. The algorithms of the neuron synthesis without logically indistinguishable failures to an accuracy of the input-output are developed in [15-15]. The proposed algorithms are sufficiently efficient for the separate neuron diagnostics, but they are practically inapplicable to the neural networks with a large number of neurons.  The algorithms of the second group are described in [16-5, 16-6]. They include di- agnostic methods of neuron circuits of special types  2-neurons combination, cascade circuit, etc. . The disadvantage of the proposed diagnostic procedures is their low prac- tical applicability.  The algorithms of the neural networks’ technical diagnostics that provide the con- trol over their performance and failure localization to an accuracy of a separate neu- ron are described below. The algorithm of neuron failure localization in the neural network is based on the investigation of the network state graph represented in Sect. 16.1. This technique provides the algorithm of minimum fault detection test for failures of the logical constant type. The method of adaptive diagnostics presented in Sect. 16.4 is based on the synthesis of an adaptive diagnostic network in the form of a neural net- work. It localizes any failure of the logical constant type that occurs in the neural network at the neuron input-output during one cycle of the neural network performance.  All the diagnostic algorithms considered in this chapter can be divided into two  groups by methods of their realization: software or hardware.  The following algorithms belong to the first group: the algorithm of failure localiza- tion in the neural network  Sect. 16.2  and the algorithm of the minimum fault detec- tion test design for the failures of the logical constant type. The former algorithm is based on the construction and investigation of the neural network state graph. The latter algorithm is based on the construction of the minimum neural network state graph corresponding to the minimum fault detection test for the logical constant fail- ure type at the neuron outputs.   322  Chapter 16  ·  Neural Network Diagnostics  The second group includes the method of adaptive diagnostics of failures of the logical constant type at the neuron inputs-outputs. This method is based on the mod- eling of all possible failures of some given type, learning sample creation, and synthe- sis of the adaptive diagnostics network.  16.1 Neural Network State Graph – The Main Notions and Definitions  Different methods for the description of the neural network functioning exist: analyti- cal, structural, geometrical, etc. Though each of these methods provides a complete description of a given neural network, it mainly reflects one particular characteristic of the network functioning. We introduce below the notion for the neural network state that describes the logics of its functioning.  Definition 1. Let us call the value aij that represents the outputs of all the neurons of the i-th layer and satisfies the condition  as a j-th node of the i-th layer of the state graph. Here Hi is the number of neurons in the i-th layer; al  ij is the output value of the j-th neuron in the i-th layer.  Definition 2. The state graph branch is a directed segment linking two state graph nodes and designated as  aij → alk   ,     l = i+1  Definition 3. The state graph nodes of the zero level representing the input variable values are called the tops of the state graph.  Definition 4. The state graph nodes of the W-th level  W is the number of neural net- work layers  are called the roots of the state graph.  Definition 5. A path in the state graph is an arbitrary chain consisting of nodes linked by branches according to the functioning of the neural network possessing a top and a root.  Definition 6. The state graph represents a tree-like directed disconnected graph com- posed of paths and nodes located at corresponding levels.  Statement 1. Let us show that the state graph completely describes the neural network functioning for all values of the input variable. Consider all the nodes of the state graph related to the arbitrary path:  Since  the  node a0j0 represents the value of the input variable, and the nodes aiji  i = 1, 2, …,W  represent the outputs of all the neurons and all the layers in the order of the number increase, then the network functioning, i.e., its total response to the given   16.2  ·  Algorithm of Failure Localization in the Neural Networks  323  input action a0j0, is completely determined. Since the state graph is the aggregate of all the possible paths, then it determines the neural network response to all the input actions.  Definition 7. Neuron  failure  is  considered  as  critical  if the  fault  that  results  in  the emergence of the error at this neuron output  when one or several input values occur at the input of this neuron  finally results in the error at the output of the whole neural network. Neuron failure is considered as uncritical if any error at its output does not result in the error at the output of the whole neural network.  Definition 8. A path in the state graph is considered as a faulty one if it corresponds to the neural network with a critical failure. I.e., the fault path possesses the root corre- sponding to the wrong value of the logical function realized by the neural network.  Definition 9. A path possessing a required root, i.e., a path corresponding to the neural network without failures, or with uncritical failures, or with critical failures that do not influence upon the given neural network input value, is considered as a correct one.  Definition 10. A complete state graph is a graph with 2n tops, where n is the dimensio- nality of the neural network input.  Definition 11. A  closed  region  formed  by  hyperplanes   realized  by  neurons   and hypercube faces is called a hypercube compartition. Each compartition has its number determined by the number of the neuron outputs, i.e., the number of compartitions is the state graph node.  16.2 Algorithm of Failure Localization in the Neural Networks  The essence of the proposed algorithm will be explained in some particular examples. Let us first consider the case of the single-fold failures and then generalize the ob- tained results for the case of multiple failures.  Let us take the three-layer neural network with three neurons in the first layer, two neurons in the second layer, and one neuron in the third layer. The location of hyper- planes realized by the first-, second-, and third-layer neurons is shown in Fig. 16.1a–c j is the output value of the i-th neuron in the j-th layer  at j = 0, it is respectively, where xi an input variable value . The criss-crosses indicate the values that provide 1 at the neural network output, and circles indicate the value providing 0 at the neural network output. The numeric characters at each hyperplane indicate the number of neurons in the layer. The full state graph corresponding to the considered neural network is represented in Fig. 16.2. Let us consider, for example, a parametrical critical failure of the first neuron in the first layer. The hyperplane positions in this case are represented in Fig. 16.3a–c. As a result of the failure neuron weighting coefficient changes, the hypercube top 110 appeared in another compartition with the number 100  it was initially in compartition 000 . This results in the neural network output error: not all the criss-crosses and circles are in the different compartitions. The full state graph corresponding to this failure is shown in Fig. 16.4. The dashed line indicates the one-valued branches of the fault paths.   324  Chapter 16  ·  Neural Network Diagnostics  Fig. 16.1.

The state graph of the three- layer neural network with failure  Fig. 16.3   A single path in the state graph corresponds to each neural network input value. Consequently, the transfer of the hypercube top into the given compartition corre- sponds to the path transformation, related to this given top, into some fault path. This new path has the same top but some of its other tops are changed.   16.2  ·  Algorithm of Failure Localization in the Neural Networks  325  Fig. 16.5. Hyperplanes realized by the three-layer neural network with failure  Fig. 16.6. The state graph of the three- layer neural network with failure  Fig. 16.5   Figure 16.5a–c represents another example of the parametrical failure of the con- sidered neuron. As a result of the fault, the tops 100 and 110 of the unit hypercube appeared in the new compartitions 000 and 100, respectively. It corresponds to the emergence of two fault paths in the state graph in Fig. 16.6.  The problem of the failure neuron search using the state graph consists in the search of such a transformation of one or several fault paths into correct paths that does not result in the emergence of additional fault paths. The form of this transformation  num- bers of node positions in the state graph that changed their values  must indicate the number of the failure neuron. In the example represented in Fig. 16.4, the only fault path  110 → 100 → 00 → 1  must be transformed into another path  110 → 000 → 10 → 0   16.1    16.2   It is seen from  16.1  and  16.2  that some node positions changed their values. The first distinct position indicates the possible failure of the first neuron in the first layer. The validity of such a proposition can be shown if proving the following statement.  Statement 2. Only one-valued branches of the fault paths can be transformed with the help of the state graph at the search of the neuron failure in the neural network. Let us prove this. The values of the logical function  the roots of the state graph  are correctly and unambiguously put into correspondence with all the tops of the state graph cor- responding to the failure-free neural network. Some of the branches change, and the   326  Chapter 16  ·  Neural Network Diagnostics  fault branch emerges at the failure occurrence. Each of the fault paths corresponds to a single error at the neural network output. The required transformation is the inverse to the failure emergence transformation, i.e., the transformation that eliminates the failure and does not add any new failure. Let us assume that we transform the many- valued branch of the fault path. This means that all the other paths possessing this node will obtain another root. And since these paths were correct according to the initial assumption, then the transformation converts them into the fault ones. But this contradicts the transformation feasibility, and therefore the statement is proved.  In the case of another failure in the state graph shown in Fig. 16.6, one observes two fault paths with the tops 100 and 110. The first path has the single one-value branch at the zero level. Let us consider all the possible transformations of this branch into the branches  of  the  corresponding  parts  of  correct  paths:   → 100 → 00 → 1   and  → 010 → 11 → 1 . As a result, the transformations have the following form:  100 →  0 → 1 00 → 00 → 1  100 →  0 → 1 0 → 11 → 1  110 →  1 → 0 00 → 10 → 0  110 → 100 →  0 → 1 0 → 0  where two values in brackets indicate the value change at this position during the trans- formation performance. One can expect from  16.3  that the failure neuron is the first neuron in the first layer. Similarly, one can expect from  16.4  that the failure neuron is the second neuron in the first layer. It can be written for the branch of the zero level in the second fault path:  i.e., the first neuron of the first layer is under a cloud. The second path is also one- valued at the first layer. Consequently, the following transformation is possible:   16.3    16.3    16.5    16.6   This suggests the possible failure of the first neuron in the second layer. Let us prove the following statement in order to reveal the required neuron out of the whole assem- blage of the suspected neurons.  Statement 3. Let us assume that one critical neuron failure exists in the neural network, and more than one fault path exists in the state graph. If the set of neuron numbers suspected to be the numbers of the failure neurons is obtained, then there exists a neuron number that is found in this set a maximum number of times, and it represents the number of the failure neuron. Let us assume that there are N fault paths and one critical neuron failure in the state graph. It follows from the nature of any failure that there always exists a transformation inverse to the failure. Let us assume that this trans- formation corresponds to the neuron number that is not maximal out of all suspected neuron numbers. It means that not all the fault paths are transformed  as it follows from the search procedure for the suspected neuron . And the latter conclusion contra- dicts the above assumptions.   16.2  ·  Algorithm of Failure Localization in the Neural Networks  327  According to the above statements, the first neuron in the first layer in the afore- mentioned example is the failure neuron because its number is found twice among the suspected neurons.  The search process of the failure neuron number can be simplified on the basis of  the following statement.  Statement 4. Let us perform a sequential  from the top to the root  comparison be- tween the fault path in the state graph and the corresponding correct path. The first distinct position indicates the number of the failure neuron. Let us prove this state- ment. According to the above statement 2, in the case of several one-valued branches in the considered fault path, it is necessary to search the individual transformation for each branch. However, we want to prove that it is sufficient to find the only one trans- formation for one correct branch belonging to the uppermost level.  Let us consider one failure in the neural network. Compare sequentially the nodes of the fault path in the state graph. Let the node aij be distinct, and the branches of the j-th and  j + 1 -th level be one-valued. The noncoincidence of the node aij indicates the error at the output of the i-th neuron in the j-th layer. Since the nodes of the previous layers coincided, then namely the i-th neuron in the j-th layer is a failure neuron.  Only a single failure occurred in the neural network according to the assumption. Then all other noncoincidences of the nodes are caused by the failure of namely the i-th neuron in the j-th layer.  Let us list the sequence of the main stages of the algorithm for the failure neuron localization in the case of the single-fold failure. The state graph of the correct func- tioning neural network is considered to be given.  1. The values of the input variable are sequentially applied to the neural network input; 2. The neuron outputs are stored for each input value  a path in the state graph is  3. The obtained output value is compared with the root of the corresponding path in the given state graph  a path with the same top . If the roots coincide then go to p. 1, otherwise go to p. 4;  4. The positions of both paths in the state graph are compared from the top to the  created ;  root;  5. The first distinct position indicates the number of the failure neuron, and the pro-  cess terminates because the failures are single-fold.  The proposed algorithm can be easily generalized for the case of multi-fold failures. The example represented in Figs. 16.5 and 16.6 shows that the failure can influence the appearance of errors in the following layers, and the comparison between nodes can result in the wrong consideration of the failure after-effect as the failure itself. The failure search algorithm in the case of many-fold failures is  1. The values of the input variable are sequentially applied to the neural network input; 2. The neuron outputs are stored for each input value  a path in the state graph is  created ;   328  Chapter 16  ·  Neural Network Diagnostics  3. The obtained output value is compared with the root of the corresponding path in the given state graph  a path with the same top . If the roots coincide and the ap- plied input value is not the last one then go to p. 1, otherwise go to p. 4;  4. Positions of both paths in the state graph are compared from the top to the root; 5. The first distinct position indicates the number of the failure neuron. If the applied  input value is not the last one then go to p. 1, otherwise, go to p. 6;  6. Perform the failure correction and go to p. 6.  If the failure neurons are located in W layers, then the process is repeated W times. In order to estimate the operation speed of the proposed method, let us compare it with the enumerative technique consisting in the test of each neuron in the neural network with single-fold failures. The state graph of the correct functioning neural network is considered to be given. Let us create the state graph corresponding to the neural network with failures.  A. Apply sequentially all the input variable values to the neural network input and obtain a state graph path and an output value for each input value. Compare the result with a correct neural network  without failures . If both outputs coincide, then apply the next input value, otherwise go to p. B. Thus, 2H0 elementary operations of bit-by-bit comparison are performed after the application of the full set of values to the neural network input.  B. A fault path is detected in the state graph. Compare it with the corresponding path of the correct neural network. The first distinct position indicates the number of the failure neuron. If only one neuron failure exists, then  of elementary comparisons is performed after the application of the full set of the input values. Then the maximum comparison operation number in the case of the failure localization algorithm can be expressed in the following form:  The  value N1 reaches  its  maximum   16.7   because  the  suspected  failure  neuron  possesses the last number in the last layer and the last fault path.  Let us consider now the neural network test using the enumerative technique. If the complete test for one neuron has a length of 2Ni, and all the neurons must be tested  Ni is the number of neurons inputs in the  i-th layer; Ni = Hi–1 , then the number of elementary comparisons in the case of enumeration is   16.7    16.8    16.2  ·  Algorithm of Failure Localization in the Neural Networks  329  The value N2 reaches its maximum in the sense that the test length for one neuron  is estimated as 2Ni.  Let us show the validity if the inequality  N1max < N2max  Taking into account  16.7  and  16.8 , one obtains for the inequality  16.9   Removing the summation symbols in the latter expression, one gets  Taking into account the evident inequalities,  the inequality  16.10  takes the following form:  The cases of practical interest are H0 The expression  16.11  in this case takes the following form:  ≥ 3 and H1max = 2H0.  Taking the logarithm of  16.12 , one gets H0 > 1, which is always valid. The inequal-  ity  16.9  is therefore proved.  based on the enumerative technique.  Thus, the proposed failure localization algorithm is always faster than the algorithms  Let us perform the similar operation speed estimations in the case of multi-fold failures. Consider the case of m failures in k layers. Additionally, let the neuron failure localization be the worst one: k = kmax = W. Then the inequality  16.9  has the follow- ing form:   16.9    16.10    16.11    16.12    16.13    330  Chapter 16  ·  Neural Network Diagnostics  Since W ≤ H1, then the inequality  16.13  takes the form  In the case H1  ≥ H2 > 1, W ≤ H1, one obtains  and the inequality  16.14  takes the following form:   16.14    16.15    16.16    16.17   The inequality  16.15  is valid if H1 > H2 > … > HW and H1 = … = HW. Then the in-  equality  16.13  is also valid.  Let us estimate now  by the lower-bound estimation  the relative speed gain at the transfer from the enumerative technique to the failure localization algorithm in the case of multi-fold failures:  where N* 1max is the lower-bound estimation for the failure localization algorithm op- eration speed in the case of multi-fold failures. If H1 = H2 = … = HW, then the inequal- ity  16.16  takes the following form:  – If H1 > H2 > … > HW, then one can use some average value H  instead of H in  16.17 .  For example, one can take       or  It is evident that one can ignore the second summand in the sum  16.17  at suffi- ciently high values of H. Hence, according to the lower-bound estimation, the relative speed gain at the transfer from the sequential enumerative testing to the proposed failure localization algorithm increases linearly with the increase of the number of neurons in the layers.   16.3  ·  Algorithm of the Minimum Test Design for the Failures of the Logical Constant Type  331  16.3 Algorithm of the Minimum Test Design for the Failures of the Logical Constant Type at the Neuron Outputs  The proposed algorithm for the minimum fault detection test design has a restricted application field because this test checks not all the faults of the constant type, but only the faults of the logical constant types at the neuron outputs. It can be used only in the cases of failure-free neuron inputs.  Let us consider the neural network input space representing a unit hypercube divided by hyperplanes into compartitions. The considered hyperplanes are realized by the first- layer neurons. Let all the compartitions except one include one hypercube corner, and the selected compartition includes n corners. Let the number of compartition be aijj=1  Let us assume that the failure of some neuron results in the change of some value al i1. Then the compartition number for all  n corners lying inside it will change because only the failures of the logical constant types are considered. Consequently, this failure appeared to be displayed at all n input values. However, it is necessary that one failure must be displayed at not more than one input value. Then the procedure for the full test minimization  the test with 2n input values  consists in the search of compartitions including  more  than  one  corner  and  eliminating  any  excessive  corners  in  this compartition in order to provide only one corner inside it.  Since the hypercube corners are simultaneously the tops of the state graph, then the process of the full test minimization described above is similar to the full state graph minimization. Let us consider the case represented in Figs. 16.1  neural network  and 16.2  state graph . The belonging of several hypercube corners to one compartition is reflected in the state graph by the fact that all the paths with these corners have com- mon branches beginning from the first level. Let us eliminate such corners. There are five of them in the considered example:   000, 011, 101, 110, 111    16.18   Let us compose one top, for example 000, from the assemblage  16.18 . Then the  state graph looks like that represented in Fig. 16.7.  Fig. 16.7. Minimized state graph   332  Chapter 16  ·  Neural Network Diagnostics  The tops of this minimized state graph represent the input values for the minimized test   000, 001, 010, 100    16.19   Let us prove that this test is minimal across the given above set of failures.  Statement 5. The number of tops of the neural network minimized state graph in the case of logical constant type failures is equal to the length of the minimum test disclos- ing all the failures of the given class.  The number of tops determines the length of the corresponding test according to the definition of the state graph. Let us prove now that the corresponding test is mini- mal for the given number of failures.  The state graph minimization consists in the sequential enumeration of the nonempty compartitions formed by the first layer neurons and in the elimination of the second, third, etc., input space hypercube corners belonging to one compartition. This proce- dure results in the state graph minimization corresponding to the state with only one argument value in each nonempty compartition.  Let us assume that the obtained test is not minimal. Then the elimination of any top from the obtained assemblage results in the emergence of a new empty compartition, and the logical function value in this compartition is undetermined. Therefore, the neural network minimized test cannot result in the emergence of the fault path corre- sponding to the eliminated top. Taking into account a single-valued correspondence between any path in the minimized state graph and some failure group, it appears that this failure group becomes undetectable at this test. This contradicts the test definition, i.e., the detectability of all the failures of a given class. Since the eliminated top was an arbitrary one, then the test corresponding to the minimized state graph is minimal, and the statement is therefore proved.  Taking into account all the aforesaid, the procedure for the minimal test design in the case of the logical constant type failures at the neuron output can be performed according to the following scheme:  1. Two levels of the full state graph  zero-order and first-order ones  are constructed for the correct functioning neural network. In this case, each input value corresponds to the first-level state graph node;  2. The number of non-recurrent graph nodes gives the length of the minimal test, and  their corresponding tops provide the minimal test input values.  16.4 Method of the Neural Network Adaptive Failure Diagnostics  If the neural network must function in the continuous mode with high reliability, then it is impossible to interrupt its functioning for the diagnostic performance. The failure neuron therefore must be localized at the first application of the input signal that cor- responds to the neuron failure. The method of the neural network adaptive failure diagnostics is used in this case. The adaptive diagnostic network is synthesized in the   16.4  ·  Method of the Neural Network Adaptive Failure Diagnostics  333  Fig. 16.8. Hyperplanes realized by the two-layer neural network  Fig. 16.9. State graph of the two-layer neural network  Fig. 16.8   form of the neural network with full sequential connections. It must be able to localize any failure of the logical constant type at the neuron input-output at the first applica- tion of the input value that corresponds to the neuron failure, i.e., to perform diagnos- tics parallel to the neural network functioning. This method can be therefore called as “a method of parallel diagnostics”.  Let us consider the case of the learning sample generation for the adaptive diagnos- tic network synthesis in the example of the two-layer neural network with two neurons in the first layer and one neuron in the second layer  Fig. 16.8 .  Let us assume here and below the existence of only one failure in the neural net- work. The test is carried out during one cycle of the neural network functioning. Fig- ure 16.9 represents the full state graph of the considered neural network without fail- ures. Figures 16.10–16.12 represent state graphs for all the possible failures of the given class, where xl ij is the value of the j-th input of the i-th neuron in the j-th layer, and xl ki is the value of the i-th output of the l-th layer.  Let us divide all the failures into classes corresponding to their neurons. The num- ber of classes is equal to the number of neurons plus 1  the last class is the class of the neural network without failures . Figures 16.10–16.12 represent state graphs of the two- layer neural network for all failures of constant types respectively of the first neuron in the first layer, of the second neuron in the first layer, and of the second-layer neuron output. Let us compose aggregates of the state graph fault paths  in the case of failure classes  or failure-free paths  in the case of failure-free classes . All the repeated paths in all the classes are excluded. Each fault path corresponds to one failure. All the fault paths are considered as a part of the learning sample that represents the failures classes.   334  Chapter 16  ·  Neural Network Diagnostics  Fig. 16.10.

State graphs of the two-layer neural network  Fig. 16.8  for all failures of constant types of the second-layer neuron output  It has the following form in the considered example:   16.20    16.21   Let us take all the failure-free paths from the state graph represented in Fig. 16.9. They are considered as the second part of the learning sample that represents the fail- ure-free neural networks class:  The numeric characters near the curly braces indicate the class numbers. It is evident that all the paths in the state graph from the obtained aggregate  16.20 ,   16.21  represent the tops of the unit hypercube with dimensionality  N = 5 in the considered example. The problem of the adaptive diagnostic network synthesis is solved as a usual pattern recognition problem. The neural network is syn- thesized using the learning samples  16.20 ,  16.21  by some adaptive algorithm. This neural network divides the unit N-dimensional hypercube into several compartitions consisting of the elements of one class. Such a partition is possible with the unit prob- ability if there are no equal elements in different classes. Let us prove the following statement.  Statement 6. Any two paths in the neural network state graph are different if they cor- respond to the failures of two different neurons.  Let us consider two fault paths in the state graph:   16.22    336  Chapter 16  ·  Neural Network Diagnostics  They are equal under the following requirements:  Consequently, the equal paths in the state graph have equal tops:  Thus, in order to prove the statement, one must show that the corresponding fail- ure-free path at the different failure neurons transforms into the different fault paths. Let this failure-free path be  There are two different failure types:  1  the failures corresponding to the neurons of different layers and  2  the failures corresponding to the neurons of the same layer. Let us consider the first case, when the failure neurons are located in the l-th and → bkjk, where the arrows indicate to the k-th layers. Then it is evident that cljl transformation of one node to another one in the case of neuron failures. Thus, when the neuron failure in the failure-free path  16.23  occurs in the l-th layer, then the nodes ciji with the numbers l, l + 1,…,W transform into the nodes biji with the numbers l, l + 1,…,W respectively. When the neuron failure in the failure-free path  16.23  occurs in the k-th layer, then the nodes ciji transform into the nodes biji with the numbers k, k + 1,…,W respectively. Consequently, one can write  → aljl, ckjk   16.23    16.24   Let us assume that l<k, then according to  16.24 , aiji  the paths a and b are different.  ≠ biji, i = l, l + 1, …, k – 1, k, i.e.,  Let us consider the second case, when the failure neurons are located in the same  layer. Let the l-th and s-th neurons in the i-th layer be the failure neurons. Then  and consequently, ak iji  ≠ bk  iji, k = l, s, i.e., the paths a and b are different.  Since there are no other neural network failure types beside the aforementioned  ones, then the statement is proved.  As an example, the adaptive diagnostic neural network was synthesized using the learning samples  16.20 ,  16.21  according to an adaptive algorithm. Its block diagram is represented in Fig. 16.13.  The block diagram is reduced to the form of the neural network with full sequential connections. The connections with zero weights are not shown. The weights between   16.4  ·  Method of the Neural Network Adaptive Failure Diagnostics  337  Fig. 16.13. Block diagram of the adaptive diagnostic network in the case of the two-layer neural net- work  Fig. 16.8   the neurons of the first and second layers are  + 1. The weighting coefficients of the first-layer neurons are indicated near the corresponding inputs by the numerical char- acters. The threshold values are indicated inside the rectangles corresponding to the respective neurons. The neural network has four outputs, and it is synthesized in such a way that the emergence of 1 at one of the outputs  with 0 at all other outputs  means that the input value is considered to belong to the corresponding class.  The high structure redundancy observed at the adaptive diagnostic network syn- thesis is related to the disadvantages of this method. Such a redundancy is the “pay- ment” for the high operation speed provided by such an approach. Another disadvan-   338  Chapter 16  ·  Neural Network Diagnostics  tage of this method is the existence of only one neuron at the neural network output. In this case, the failures at the outputs of neurons in the penultimate layer and the corresponding inputs of the last layer are logically undistinguishable. But the advan- tage of high operation speed makes this disadvantage insignificant for the neural net- works with a large number of neurons.  Let us consider the peculiarities of the adaptive diagnostics method. The learning sample generation requires the modeling of all the failures of the given class. This is the most time-consuming part of the adaptive diagnostic neural network synthesis. The automation of this process allows one to simplify significantly the adaptive diag- nostic network synthesis, and the use of the advanced algorithms allows one to obtain the optimal implementation of this network.  The realization of the neural network itself, as well as of the adaptive diagnostic net- work using mono-functional element with single-type connections, provides an advan- tage at the implementation of the whole device in the form of VLSI circuit. It also allows one to use one and the same synthesis technique for both networks. Since the neuron redundancy exists in the process of the adaptive diagnostic network synthesis, then it is advisable to use this method for production of devices with high reliability requirements. The enhancement of the described approach application can be performed at the expense of the parametrical failure class. In order to prove this statement, one must show that all possible fault paths corresponding to the parametrical failures belong to the set of fault paths for the failures of the logical constant type at the neuron inputs- outputs. The check of this condition in the case of the simplest neural networks showed its validity. However, its proof in the general case seems to be rather complicated.

The objective  reason  for  providing  the  development  of  this  new  part  of  computational mathematics is a 30-year stock in the field of neural network theory that allows for the development of the universal approach of the neural network algorithms aimed at the solution in the domain of general and applied mathematics.  We shall call the computational procedure that can be realized mainly by the neural network of a different structure the neuron algorithm  or neural network algorithm . The main task that solves by the neurocomputer is the fast problem solving.  The  first  attempts  to  solve  the  computational  problems  with  the  help  of neurocomputers relate to the 1960s and 1970s when the pattern recognition task was actual and included the problem of function approximation  K-classes of patterns in the multi-dimensional feature space . Thereafter, some other attempts to solve the clas- sical computational problems with the help of neural networks were taken. One of the examples of such tasks is the matrix inversion problem. The number of problems solved with the help of neurocomputers was significantly enlarged at the end of the 1980s. One can tell now about the potential universalism of neurocomputers. It is clear that any mathematical problem can be solved on the neural network logical basis.  Even such problems that seem to be trivial  addition, multiplication, division, ex- tracting a root, numerical inversion, etc.  can be solved with the help of neurocomputers much more effectively than with the help of the usual Boolean elements.  The field of application of the tasks that can be efficiently solved by neurocomputers is permanently and rapidly widening. The class of general mathematic tasks that can be efficiently solved by neurocomputers is rather wide. It includes, for example, the following kinds of tasks:   cid:1  Systems of linear and nonlinear algebraic equations and inequalities;  cid:1  The tasks of function approximation and extrapolation;  cid:1  The optimization tasks  linear, nonlinear, and dynamic programming; combinato- rial tasks; the commercial traveler task; the task of the timetable arrangement; dif- ferent tasks with graphs ;   cid:1  The solution of ordinary nonlinear differential equations;  cid:1  The solution of differential equations in partial derivatives.   342  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  Various transformations can be realized in the neural network logical basis whereas their implementation using classical computers requires the development of special algorithms  algorithms of direct and inverse trigonometric and exponential functions that are the activation functions in the neural network approach .  An especially important part of general neuromathematics is a complex of prob- lems related to graphs. In particular, these are the problems of the search formalization and calculation of the routes, cycles and cutsets in graphs, and the problems of parti- tion of graph, its drawing and arrangement.  It is evident that the class of problems of general neuromathematics will increase in the nearest future. In the world, the number of scientific studies related to the neural network algorithms is rather large. The peculiarity of the Russian school of neuro- mathematics is the use of effective scientific results in the field of neural networks and corresponding effective methods for the neural network algorithm development ad- equate to the specific solution.  The  development  of  neuromathematics  was  initiated  not  by  mathematicians but by the specialists in the theory of control and neurocomputers under the “nonver- bal behavior” of the single-functioned workers in the field of computational math- ematics. The methods of control theory, analytical self-adaptive systems and adaptive filtering  formed  the  basis  of  the  development  of  the  neural  network  algorithm methods. The neural network algorithms are rather “similar” for different mathematical tasks because a large number of common problems are present in the methods of neural network algorithm development in the wide variety of solutions. The majority of these common problems are either not taken into consideration or passed over in silence.  The objective reasons for the transition to the neural network algorithms for the  solution of different tasks are the following:   cid:1  The inability to solve complex tasks of general and applied mathematics in a given time by the use of computational systems of other architectures  at the equal cost of neurocomputers and these computational systems ;   cid:1  The objective necessity for the use of the neural network algorithm and its adequacy  to the task under consideration.  This results in the following main distinctions between the neural network algo-  rithm and any other one:   cid:1  The super-high parallelism  the parallelism of the neural network algorithms is  always higher than that of technical facilities for their implementation ;   cid:1  The high capacity-to-cost  or capacity-to-size  ratio of technical facilities for the  neural network algorithms implementation.  As the development of neuromathematics  a part of computational mathematics realizing the tasks of general and applied mathematics in the neural network logical basis  is in progress, neurocomputers will pretend to the role of universal computa- tional systems.  The main reasons to write the present article are the following:   17.2  ·  Neural Network Theory – A Logical Basis for the Development of Problem Solution Algorithms  343   cid:1  The primitiveness of the neural network algorithm that is used in the initial stages of the tasks’ solution  as a rule, after some solution quality is achieved, there are no methods for its further improvement ;   cid:1  The necessity for the elaboration of the neural network algorithms adequate to the task under consideration in the framework of some unified tasks solution technique in the neural network logical basis.  A large number of the known works in the domain of the neural network theory, neuromathematics, neural control and neurocomputers can be conditionally divided into two parts. The first one resulted from the general reflections of different authors who are interested in these problems and who want to improve the solutions which they have found in the scientific publications or which they invented on the basis of some general ideas. The second one deals with the development of ideas that are born in the process of specific problem solving. The long-term practice shows that the real and serious theoretical statements and studies in this field of activity are developed namely in the second part of these works. This fact is not a simple appeal for the more active solution of practical problems but is a result of the long-term analysis of the large number of theoretical studies in this field of knowledge.  The present study defines in some sense the logical pathway for the development of the neural network algorithms for the problem solutions and can serve as a basis for the creation of the intellectual program package implementing the neural network program solution algorithms.  17.2 Neural Network Theory – A Logical Basis for the Development of the Neural Network Problem Solution Algorithms  The neural network theory presents the logical basis for the solution of the tasks of general and applied mathematics in the same way as earlier Boolean logic was the basis for the solution of the tasks by the computers with Neumann architecture.  The neural network is a network with a finite number of layers consisting of single- type elements. Each element is similar to the neuron with different types of connec- tions between layers. The number of neurons in the layers must provide the given quality of the solution, and the number of layers must be as small as possible in order to minimize the time for this solution.  The main properties of the neural networks are given below:   cid:1  The homogeneous neural networks are characterized by the gradual degradation due to the breakdown of separate elements. This fact was shown by Rosenblatt who constructed the three-layer perceptron with random connections in the first layer with a redundant number of elements in this layer. Here, the function realized by the neural network is distributed across the structure;   cid:1  The structure of the homogeneous neural network provides the possibility of large- scale parallelism during the performance of the large number of synchronous op- erations  addition, multiplication, and nonlinear fast-response transformation. The neural network structure does not contain complicated and “long” irrational opera-   344  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  tions over the operands  division, extraction of root, etc.  that the algorithms used in the monoprocessor computers;   cid:1  The neural networks implement a rather flexible and complex functional transforma- tion of the input state space into the output one. Hence, the flexibility of this transfor- mation can be controlled by the number of layers and type of the used connection.  cid:1  The neural network structure allows for the analytical description of the input space  transformation into the output one;   cid:1  The previous property of the neural network structure allows for the analytical adjustment of the neural network and for the control of the algorithm functioning in the process of solution;   cid:1  The complexity of the neural network used for the solution of the particular prob-  lem reflects the complexity of the problem itself;   cid:1  In the future, with the use of the linear serial Gill machines, the neural network structure will allow for the solution of the problem of analytical description and the design of the adaptation algorithm synthesis in multilayer neural networks.  The main advantages of the neural networks being the logical basis of the complex  problem solution algorithms are the following:   cid:1  The invariance of the neural network synthetic procedure, respectively the feature  space dimensionality and size;   cid:1  Correspondence to the modern and cutting-edge technology in microelectronics;  cid:1  Fault-tolerance in the sense of monotonous, rather than catastrophic quality changes sums depending on the number of hors de combat elements in the sense of monoto- nous, rather than catastrophic problem-solution quality changes depending on the number of the breakdown elements.  The postulatory base of the neural network theory is the stochastic Bayesian model of the outward things. In this connection, the formation input signal is carried out in terms of the pattern channel and the channel of supervisor instructions. Additionally, the input signal represents in general the nonstationary random signal with a complex, unknown, multimodal density of probability distribution.  17.3 Selection of the Problems Adequate to the Neural Network Logical Basis  The bottom-line goal of the present study is the design of the program package in the neural network logical basis. The use of such a program package is necessary when the development engineer working over the solution algorithm has already finished the stage of decision concerning the necessity of the neural network approach and has assured himself that such an approach is necessary for him.  The investigator begins the development of the neural network algorithm from the physical problem statement. The description of the physical problem statement must be performed not verbally, but in the form of the specific document, describing the initial data and the essence of the physical result that must be obtained as the result of calculations. If the development engineer of the neural network algorithm gets the   17.3  ·  Selection of the Problems Adequate to the Neural Network Logical Basis  345  physical problem statement from some other person, then he must update the problem statement together with the problem originator. At any rate, the problem originator must not necessarily be a specialist in neural network algorithms.  All the problems in the physical  not mathematical  problem statement are divided into two parts: unformalized and the formalized problems. Unformalized problems are the problems that cannot be formalized in the form of some mathematical terms, formulas, structures, graphs, etc. As it was mentioned above, the number of such prob- lems permanently grows. These problems are usually complex and hypercomplex and they can be solved only in the framework of the neural network approach. The formal- ized problems are the problems that can be represented in the form of the system of linear or nonlinear algebraic equations, or in the form of the system of ordinary non- linear differential equations, in terms of the system of equations in partial derivatives. The question concerning the class of problems that can be solved in the most effi- cient manner by different computing devices designed according to the new principles is always topical. It was considered for a long time that neurocomputers are efficient in the solution of the unformalized or ill-formalized problems that obligatorily include the algorithms with the learning procedure using real experimental data.  The problem of approximation of the particular functions with the discrete domain of variation is one of the main problems of this type. This is the problem of pattern recognition. The unformalized problems are evidently an important argument for the use of neurocomputers. However, it is necessary to remember that the problem of pattern recognition is only a special case of function approximation. And not statistical  re- gression models  but rather flexible nonlinear  neural network  approximation meth- ods are used in this case.  At the present time, a new class of problems with pronounced natural parallelism has emerged  signal processing, image processing . This class of problems does not require the learning procedure using the experimental data. However, it is well repre- sented in the neural network logical basis.  It is also efficient to use the neural network algorithms for the problems with the input information space  input data  generated by the Monte Carlo method, rather then analytically.  The question about the efficiency and necessity of the representation and solution  of the problem class in the neural network logical basis is very important.  The first problem class was the problem of pattern recognition. A lot of different algo- rithms and different architectures of computers were used for its solution in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, the neural network algorithms for its solution became dominant. The second problem class with the dominant use of the neural network algorithms is the problem of function approximation and extrapolation. At present, the main prob- lem consists in the methods of the neural network solution algorithm development in each particular case.  The third problem class in which the advantages of the neural network algorithms are practically proofed is the problem of the dynamic system control or neural control. Two main tasks concerning the dynamic object identification  analysis  and construction of the correcting filters in the control loop  synthesis  that can be solved in the neural network logical basis make the use of the approximation methods unnecessary for the nonlinear differential equation solutions that are oriented on von Neumann computers.   346  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  The aforementioned problems can be conditionally divided into two groups: the first one is adequate to the neural network logical basis and the second one is “general”. The time required for the solution of the “general” problems of large dimensionality using von Neumann computers or transputer-like  claster  computers can exceed the admissible time. The achievement of the admissible time in this case can result in exceeding the capacity or the cost of the computer system. Then the necessity to de- velop the neural network algorithms and the neural network hardware emerges.  The  necessity  of  the  solution  of  mathematical  problems  of  high  dimensionality appears as a rule in the case of the solution of practical tasks related to high technolo- gies  in  various  scientific  studies,  industry  and  economics. Namely  the  widespread development and application of neurocomputers are an indication of the development of high technologies.  The problems that cannot be solved by the computational facilities of the current development level were always observed in the history of computer engineering. Gen- erally, at the present time, the transfer to the neural network logical basis is used in the case of the sharp increase of the solution space dimensionality or in the case of the requirement of a sharp decrease of the solution time.  The iteration algorithms are the natural solution under the condition of the prob- lem of high dimensionality. The known iteration solution algorithms in the neural network logical basis such as, for example, the algorithms for the solution of the sys- tems of linear algebraic equations, are often rather primitive, consisting of only one layer. This decreases the problem solving quality. The use of the neural networks with different structures including the neural networks with feedback coupling opens a broad perspective of development in such a field of neuromathematics.  The increase of the class of problems solved in the neural network logical basis can be efficiently estimated by the ratio of the productivity rate to the cost as compared with the classical von Neumann computers. This estimation shows that neurocomputers are close to the class of general-purpose computers.  It is assumed that the algorithms and programs will be efficiently used on any ex- istent and prospective neurocomputer and form the basis of the future mathematical program libraries for neurocomputers, i.e., the basis of the applied software for the prospective neurocomputers as general-purpose computers. The developed algorithm software will constitute the basis of neuromathematics.  It  must  be  mentioned  that  the  neural  network  solution  algorithms  for  different problems are often “similar” to each other. They have a canonical neural network struc- ture selected for some particular problem: the number of layers and the number of neurons in the layers, the neural network adjustment procedure. Therefore develop- ment engineers and users obtain the possibility for the objective quantitative compari- son of the different algorithms.  We consider that any problem can be solved with the help of the neurocomputer much more effectively than with the usual computer due to the fact that any problem algorithm can be represented in the neural network logical basis with the controlled neural layer number and minimized number of iterations of the adjustment procedure.  This means that the neural network algorithm for the solution of any problem on the logical level is much more parallel than any of its physical implementation. This property differentiates neural computers from such systems as transputer-like ones in   17.3  ·  Selection of the Problems Adequate to the Neural Network Logical Basis  347  which the software designers usually modify the solution algorithms developed ini- tially for the single-processor computers. These modifications are aimed at minimiz- ing the expenses related to the information exchange between processors in the prob- lem solving process.  According to the aforementioned remarks, it is necessary to comment on Fig. 17.1 that represents the logical structure of the selection procedure for the problems ad- equate to the neural network logical basis. As it was mentioned, all the problems can be divided into two types as formalized and unformalized problems. The author con- siders that the unformalized problems can practically be solved only on the neural network logical basis.  After the development of the neural network solution algorithm for the unformalized problem, its programming on the workstation computer, and analysis of the solution time dependence on the neural network parameters  in particular, such a parameter is the problem dimensionality , one can determine if the time required for the solution is sufficient for the customer. If this time is sufficient enough, then the neurocomputer implementation is the workstation computer program. In the opposite case, one can choose, in practice, only two possible decisions:  1. The design of the hardware for the neural network problem solving accelerator based on some technology with dependence on the customer’s requirements concerning the duration of the development work and concerning the weight, size and cost of the hardware unit.  In this case, for the particular selected technology of the neurochip and neuro- plate  implementation,  one  can  approximately  calculate  the  number  of  these neurochips and neuro-plates in the hardware accelerator. Then the neuro-plate, the unit or the pillar of the neural network hardware accelerator with the host-com- puter, represents the neurocomputer’s implementation.  2. In the case of the strict requirements concerning the duration of the development work and the absence of the requirements concerning the weight, size and cost of the hardware unit, the development of the program for the claster computer with parallelizing of the neural network algorithm using several processors can be done. The number of processors required for the problem implementation in this case can be approximately estimated because the use of the neural network algorithms al- lows for the control performed by the neural network algorithm. The algorithm can provide smoothness of the processors’ loading and minimize the expenses related to the information exchange between processors. Then the neurocomputer imple- mentation  is  the  program  for  the  claster  computer  realizing  the  parallel  neural network algorithm.  Computational mathematics deals with the solution of formalized problems. And if the customer is satisfied with the operation speed that provides the solution algorithm in the classical logical basis adequate to the von Neumann architecture then there is no necessity in the use of the neural network logical basis. The development of advanced technology and the complexity of the formalized problems due to the increase of the dimensionality often result in the unsatisfactory time required for the solution on the workstation computers with the use of the classical algorithms.   348  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  Fig. 17.1. Logical structure of the selec- tion procedure  Then, as it was mentioned above, the designer has only two possible decisions:  1. To develop the neural network algorithm for the formalized problem and then use the procedure described above for the unformalized problems, see [17-4], and ref- erences in that study, see also [17-6] and references in that study given in the section “Neuromathematics;”  2. To develop the program for the claster computer with parallelizing of the classic algorithm. This method is used by the majority of the claster computer users. How- ever, one must take into account that the designer is solving – Either a purely scientific problem without constraints on the weight, size and  cost of the computer, i.e. using the claster computer that is available to him;  – Or the practical problem with significant constraints on the weight, size and cost of the computer. Then the designer is often forced to use the neural network logical basis and to develop the neurocomputer, i.e., to elaborate the neural net- work solution algorithm.  Notice that even in the case of the solution of purely scientific problems without constraints on the weight, size and cost of the computer, it is sometimes necessary to use the neural network logical basis for the solution of the problem of optimization of the loading distribution between processors of the claster computers. Therefore, Fig. 17.1 shows a set of possibilities for the neurocomputer implementation with the reasonable selection of the problems adequate to the neural network logical basis.   17.4  ·  The General Structure of the Program Package for Problem Solution  349  17.4 The General Structure of the Program Package for Problem Solution in the Neural Network Logical Basis  The foundation of the unified method for the problem solution in the neural network logical basis is the method of the adaptation algorithm synthesis for the multilayer neural networks. According to this method, the following adjustment algorithms for the mul- tilayer neural networks were developed:  Neural networks for the general performance mode  learning, self-learning, learning with the supervisor of the finite qualification, etc. ;  Neural networks for the wide class of the primary optimization criteria  minimum of the average risk function, average risk function under the constraints on its components, maximum of the a priory probability, maximum of the a-posteriori probability, etc. ;  Neural networks for the wide class of the secondary optimization functionals  gradient, gradient with memory, combination of the gradient procedure with the random search for the initial condition selection, etc. ;  Neural networks for the different multilayer neural network structures  with the arbi- trary number of neuron layers, with complete sequential, cross and feedback connec- tions, etc. .  The following principles form the basis of the neural network solution algorithm  development:  digms;  ematical problem;   cid:1  The refusal from the known neuro-packages of neural network programs and para-   cid:1  The synthesis of the neural network algorithms adequate to each particular math-   cid:1  The synthesis of the neural network algorithms and structures of the tuned neural networks without intrusion from the stated problem but with flexible and desired structure selection aimed at the improvement of the problem solving quality.  We consider the problem solving quality  as the precision of the solution and the operation speed determined, in particular, by the number of iterations in the adapta- tion procedure of the neural network.  The general methods of the mathematical problem solution in the neural network logical basis were described in [17-2]. The neural network solution algorithms are represented in this study in the whole structure defined by the methods of synthesis of the multilayer neural networks that include the following stages of the problem statement:   cid:1  Physical, geometrical;  cid:1  Mathematical;  cid:1  Neural network.   350  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  The neural network problem statement includes in turn the following stages:   cid:1  Description of the initial data;  cid:1  Determination of the input signal x n  of the neural network;  cid:1  Generation of the primary optimization functional of the neural network for the  solution of the problem;   cid:1  Determination of the output signal y n  of the neural network;  cid:1  Determination of the desired output signal of the neural network;  cid:1  Determination of the neural network error signal vector for the solution of the problem;  cid:1  Generation of the neural network secondary optimization functional through the sig-  nals in the system;   cid:1  Selection of the secondary optimization functional extremum search method;  cid:1  Analytical determination of the transformation performed by the neural network;  cid:1  Selection of the particular structure of the neural network;  cid:1  The search of the analytical expression for the gradient of the secondary optimiza-  tion functional through the adjustment parameter;   cid:1  Generation of the neural network adjustment algorithm for the solution;  cid:1  Selection of the initial conditions for the neural network adjustment;  cid:1  Selection of the typical input signals for the verification of the solution procedure  for the problem;   cid:1  Development of the plan of experiments.  The aforementioned stages of the neural network solution algorithm synthesis deter- mine the complete circuit diagram of the user work with the program package  Fig. 17.2 . Figure 17.2  see p. 372 373  represents the current version of the general structure of the program package for the solution in the neural network logical basis. This structure is the pathway for the development of the neural network solution algorithm and can serve as the basis for the design of the menu for the considered program package.  After the designer’s decision to use namely the neural network solution algorithm,  he can use the two following types of neural networks:   cid:1  Neural network with flexible  variable  structure [17-1];  cid:1  Neural network with the fixed structure.  The author believes that there is no third possibility at the present time. It must be mentioned that in the Russian school of the neural network solution algorithms, the process of the solution for both possibilities was considered as some dynamical process with the use of some significantly nonlinear neural network envi- ronment. This approach was formed on the basis of the general theory of adaptive search and analytical systems.  17.5 Multilayer Neural Networks with Flexible Structure  The main advantage of the multilayer neural networks with flexible structure is the absence of the obligatory a priori information about the neural network structure  the   17.5  ·  Multilayer Neural Networks with Flexible Structure  351  number of layers and the number of neurons in the layers . This structure is formed in the process of the neural network adjustment, i.e., in the process of the solution. The obtained structure indirectly reflects the problem complexity. The more complex the trained neural network is  the number of layers and the number of neurons in the layers , the more complex the solution is.  The neural networks with flexible structure [17-1], [17-2], and [17-3] can be effi-  ciently used for different types of the input feature space:   cid:1  Binary, when the variables of the input N-dimensional vectors are represented by  the set of zeros and units;   cid:1  Κ-digital variables of the N-dimensional vector;  cid:1  Real-valued variables of the N-dimensional vector.  The multilayer neural networks with flexible structure were mostly used for the case of the N-dimensional space of the real-valued feature when the input information represents the continuum signals from some fixed time interval.  The limitation of the multilayer neural networks with flexible structure is the fact  that they can be used only for the solution of two problem classes:   cid:1  Recognition of two classes of patterns;  cid:1  Recognition of Κ classes of patterns  with generation of κΚ neural networks, rec-  ognizing each κ-th  κ= 1, …, Κ  class from the other one ;   cid:1  Self-learning  clasterization , when the input sample presented for the clasterization without the supervisor instruction about belonging to the different classes is the sample of the first class for the multilayer neural network with flexible structure, whereas the output of the white noise generator is the sample of the second class.  It is evident that the number of problems solved with the help of the multilayer  neural networks with flexible structure will increase in the future.  In the procedure of the adjustment of the multilayer neural network with flexible structure, the first layer is trained at the beginning of the procedure when the required number of neurons H1 of this layer is determined. Thereafter, the results of the first layer adjustment are used for the adjustment of the second and third layers. The num- ber of layers in the solution of the two-pattern recognition equals 2 or 3 and only the single neuron is at the output.  Then the stages of development of tests for verification of the trained neural net- work quality are executed. Thereafter, the plan of experiments is elaborated for the investigation of the quality of the neural network performance. These stages are com- mon for the multilayer neural networks with flexible structure, and they will be con- sidered below after the consideration of the neural networks with fixed structure.  At the end of the section dedicated to the multilayer neural networks with flexible structure, one must notice that at the present time, these neural networks are used for the solution of the problems of a relatively narrow class including the recognition of patterns  of  two  or Κ  classes  and  clasterization   self-learning .  There  is  a  potential probability of using such neural networks for the solution of wider classes of the prob- lems  function approximation and extrapolation, etc. .   352  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  17.6 Neural Network with Fixed Structure  According to author’s opinion, in contrast to the neural networks with flexible struc- ture, the neural networks with the fixed structure can be used for the solution of any problems in the case that they satisfy the aforementioned selection criterion No. 3. The restriction on the neural network structure selected a priori is the payment for this universalism in the problems that can be solved. The neural network structure in this case is one of the components of the vector that includes all the types of the a priori information that are required for the neural network solution algorithm development. The complete description of this vector will be given in the conclusion of the present study. The stages of the neural network solution algorithm development with the help of the neural networks with fixed structure are given below. These stages are the following:  1. Generation of the input signal including the formation of the supervisor instructions; 2. Generation of the output signal; 3. Formation of the primary optimization functional; 4. Generation of the open neural network structure; 5. Formation of the secondary optimization functional; 6. Formation of the search algorithm for the secondary optimization functional extremum; 7. Formation of the algorithm for the adaptation of the coefficients of the multilayer  neural network with fixed structure;  8. Development of tests for the verification of the performance quality of the trained  9. Elaboration of the plan of experiments for the verification of the performance quality  neural network;  of the trained neural network.  The last two items in this list are common for the neural networks of flexible as well  as fixed structures.  17.6.1 Generation of the Input Signal of the Neural Network  This problem is not trivial and sometimes it is not single-valued but has several solu- tions. It can be relatively simply formulated in the pattern recognition tasks where the patterns are already represented by the vectors of features. However, in the particular problems of signals or pattern recognition, the generation of these patterns is a rather complicated problem. This problem is complicated even in such a transparent task as the function extrapolation because of the introduction of the additional parameter  filter memory  and the special method for the further generation of the supervisor instructions for the neural network. Similar problems exist in the tasks of the neural network equalizer development, systems of neuron control, etc.  The input signal of the neural network is the signal [x– n , ε– n ], where x– n  is the series of the input patterns, ε– n  is the supervisor instruction about the patterns x– n  belonging to a particular class. Thus, both x– n  as well as ε– n  can be represented in different ways with dependence on the particular problem statement. The series x– n    17.6  ·  Neural Network with Fixed Structure  353  can be the vector of the real-valued variables, the function of some argument, some vector-function, etc.; the series ε– n  can be the real-valued variable that takes two, Κ or a continuum of values, or it can be the vector or some vector function.  The probabilistic approach to the perception of the outside makes it necessary to generate the input signal for the neural network in the form of the joint distribution function f  x–, ε– . The detailed form of this function in the different particular cases can be rather different. In the majority of the investigations of the neural network learning algorithms, it is assumed that the supervisor qualification is complete, i.e., the super- visor can exactly determine the belonging of the particular pattern to a given class.  17.6.1.1 About the Supervisor Qualification  However, in practice, the problems with the limited supervisor qualification also exist and they are not sufficiently investigated.  The elaboration of the neural network algorithms adequate to the real conditions of getting  information  for  their  adjustment  requires  an  estimation  of  real  supervisor qualification. Due to this requirement, along with the widespread learning modes of the multilayer neural network in which it is assumed that the supervisor is aware about the patterns’ belonging to a particular class with unit probability, one must consider in more detail three more learning modes introduced in [17-2]:   cid:1  Learning with the supervisor having zero qualification  self-learning, clasterization ;  cid:1  Learning with the supervisor having finite qualification;  cid:1  Learning with the supervisor having negative qualification  the “harm” mode in which the supervisor wittingly gives false information about the pattern belonging to a particular class .  Neural networks in the self-learning mode. Clasterization. In spite of the long-term his- tory of this problem, it remains still poorly investigated. The main task here consists in the processing of the set of multi-dimensional vectors aimed at the selection, according to a certain rule, of compact vectors’ groups termed clasters. The investigations in this domain were not activated during last decades due to the absence of the socio-significant problems in which the self-learning mode would play an important role. But today such problems have begun to appear. From our viewpoint, the most significant one is the prob- lem of information compression  compression of images, speech information, etc.  the solution of which by the existent classical methods have achieved the real limits of its capacity. In the scope of this problem, the aforementioned tasks that accompany the prob- lem must also be further developed. Namely these tasks are the following:   cid:1  The typical input signals;  cid:1  The initial adjustment conditions;  cid:1  The control over the iteration procedure parameters, etc.  Neural networks in the mode of learning with supervisor having finite qualification. Since the 1970s, when designing some specific systems of electrocardiogram recogni-   354  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  tion, it has been noted that in the process of electrocardiogram archive verification, an expert physician or a group of expert physicians cannot relate some electrocardio- grams to a particular class of diseases with full reliability. The investigation of the dynamics and of the results of the multilayer neural network adjustment as a function of the real idea about supervisor qualification is an important subject for future inves- tigations in the field of neural network theory.  Neural networks in the “harm” mode of learning. The neural network operation mode in which the supervisor wittingly gives false information about the pattern belonging to a certain class is completely unstudied. Probably this mode will be used under war information conditions in order to estimate the information safety of the corporate systems and regions with the help of multilayer neural networks in the case of infor- mation about weapon utilization.  Notice that in the known scientific literature, two different operating modes of the neural networks, namely the learning mode  the supervisor qualification is complete  and the self-learning mode  the supervisor qualification is zero , are regarded inde- pendently from each other. In the proposed methods, these two modes differ only by the value of some parameter. The variation of this parameter allows for the consider- ation of a lot of new modes.  17.6.1.2 Taking into Account A Priori Probabilities of the Classes’ Emergence  The necessity of taking into account the a priori probabilities of the classes’ emergence appears in different practical tasks. A typical example is the task of letter recognition in the printed text of the scanned document in the case when the probability of any letter appearance is known. The possibility to use the a priori probabilities of the classes’ emergence during the adjustment of the multilayer systems for image recognition is investigated in the study [17-2]. This possibility was permanently used in that study for the construction of the different particular systems. However, this technique re- quires additional investigation in order to use it efficiently.  17.6.1.3 Continuum of Classes  The general representation of the input signal for the multilayer neural networks of two, Κ and continuum pattern classes in the learning mode with the limited supervi- sor qualification allows for the use of the neural networks in the problem of quantita- tive estimation of the object state described by the signal x– n . In this case, the series ε– n  is real-valued and varies in some limited interval.  17.6.1.4 About the Nonstationarity of the Input Signal  In the majority of the practical problems, the neural network input signal is consid- ered to be stationary with some unknown and complex distribution function f  x–, ε– .   17.6  ·  Neural Network with Fixed Structure  355  However, problems with the non-stationary input signal f  x–, ε–  exist, and it must in- fluence the characteristics of the multilayer neural network adjustment algorithms. In the learning mode, the pattern distribution functions of each class are time depen- dent. In the self-learning mode  clasterization , both coordinates of the classes’ centers as well as their characteristics can be time dependent.  17.6.2 The Multilayer Neural Network Output Signal Generation  The output signal of the neural network is formed according to the type of solved problem.  This  signal  can  be  the  binary  value   or  the  vector  of  the  binary  values , Κ-digit value  or the vector of Κ-digit values  and real-valued variable  or the vector of the real-valued variables . The number of neurons in the output layer of the neural network and the form of the activation function of the neurons in the output layer are determined according to the output signal type. In the particular case, the output sig- nal represents some spatial argument. The output layer in this case represents the neuron continuum with the real-valued output signals rather than the discrete set.  17.6.3 Formation of the Primary Optimization Criteria  The basis of the multilayer neural network primary optimization criteria includes the following items:   cid:1  The assumed probability concept of the external world;  cid:1  The consideration of the external world as a significantly nonlinear one.  Namely this basis allows for the formation of the primary optimization criterion as the main goal that the designer wants to achieve in the development of the multilayer neural network with the adaptation algorithm for the particular solution. The prob- ability criteria described below are valid for the relatively wide class of problems, but this class can be further enlarged.  The recently developed methods for the multilayer neural network adaptation algo-  rithm synthesis can be used for the following primary optimization criteria:   cid:1  min R = p1r1 + p2r2 of the average risk function;  cid:1  min p1r1 under p2r2 = const.;  cid:1  min R for K and continuum of classes;  cid:1  The aforementioned variants for two Kp and continuum of classes;  cid:1  Different modifications of the aforementioned criteria, for example, the criterion of  maximum of the a-posteriori probability.  All these criteria can be used for the solution of the particular practical problems. One must consider the aforementioned criteria for the neural network synthesis in the proce- dure of the formation of the error-cost matrix. This matrix is used to make the decision that the pattern of one class belongs to another class  the error function in the continuum case .   356  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  As a rule, in the known studies, the error-cost matrices that emerge in the course of the assignment of the particular pattern to a particular class are assumed to be diago- nal. However, it is not often in agreement with reality. For example, in the case of the neurocomputer design for the mine recognition system with the use of the geolocator, in the matrix of costs for errors  the coefficients l21  the cost for the error to consider the mine as an irrelevant object  and l21  the cost for the error to consider the irrelevant object as a mine  cannot be equal in principle, and it must be taken into account during the adjustment of the multilayer neural network in a similar way to how it was carried out in the studies [17-2, 17-3].  The often used criterion of the minimum of the mean-root square error is the primi-  tive and particular case of the aforementioned criteria.  17.6.4 Selection of the Open Neural Network Structure.  The a priori information about the neural network structure that is used in this stage of  the  neural  network  synthesis  is  the  payment  for  the  solution  universalism.  It  is necessary to mention two main classes of the neural network structure that are used at the present time for the solution:   cid:1  Neural networks with complete sequential connections;  cid:1  Neural networks with complete feedback connections.  The selection of the neural network structure results in the following:   cid:1  The selection of the number of neuron layers;  cid:1  The selection of the number of neurons in all the layers except the last one  the number of neurons in the last layer is selected in the stage of the generation of the neural network output signal .   cid:1  The selection of the activation function in all the neuron layers except the last one  the activation function for the last layer is also selected in the stage of the genera- tion of the neural network output signal .  17.6.5 Remarks about the Selection of the Open Neural Network Structure that is Adequate to the Class of Solution Tasks  In the majority of the scientific literature, the structure of the open neural network is introduced by the authors without any explanation. The main idea of the Russian works in this field is the development of the multilayer neural network adjustment algorithms adequate to the particular solution.   17.6  ·  Neural Network with Fixed Structure  357  If the class of solution tasks allows one to define the class of effective neural net- work structures adequate to these tasks, then the elaboration of the special methods for the coefficient adjustment namely for this class of the neural network structures will increase the adaptation effectiveness for the task solution of this specific class. We describe below some variants of the neural network structures and the task classes adequate to them.  Neural networks with random connections. In his classical monograph, Rosenblat sug- gested introducing the random connections between the retina and the first layer of the multilayer neural network. Under the proper increase in the number of neurons, the systems’ reliability, related to the possible break-down of several neurons, increases. At present and in perspective of the development of microelectronic technology, the number of emulated neurons inside the super-large-scale integration on the board and in the unit is quite large. And this number will continue to increase in the future. This makes the variant of the random connections more and more necessary for implemen- tation and research.  Neural networks with lateral connections. This specific type of connections between layers in the multilayer neural network is interesting from the viewpoint of imple- mentation of the invariance to the transformation group and has been poorly inves- tigated. This is not only the invariance to the simplest affinity transformations, such as rotation, transition and the change of the affinity ratio, but also the invariance to the  more  complex  transformations  and  the  search  of  the  connections’  structures ensuring such invariance.  Cell-like neural networks. Cell-like neural networks are networks with a special topo- logical structure that is adequate, in particular, to the task of pattern processing. In this case, the natural task parallelism results in the natural parallelism in the structure organization of the processing neural network. It is necessary to note that the cell-like neural networks are adequate to the other tasks with natural parallelism; for example, to the task of lattice generation and other tasks emerging at the solution of two-dimen- sional differential equations in partial derivatives. When changing from 2D- to 3D-tasks, the similar three-dimensional cell-like neural networks will be adequate to the tasks of three-dimensional pattern processing, 3D-lattice generation, virtual reality, and the solution of three-dimensional differential equations in partial derivatives.  Neural networks with feedback loops. The conception of the neural network with feed- back loops in its classical sense was introduced in [17-2]. In this case, the feedback channels are present in the structure of the adjusted multilayer neural network. These channels are used for the transmission of the intermediate and output signals of the neural network to the input channels of the previous layers through the delay lines  for a given number of cycles . In the past, in the 1960s–1970s, it was considered that such neural network structures could be used only for the design of the memory units of a different functional destination. In the last ten to fifteen years, in foreign litera- ture, the investigations of such neural networks, conventionally called recurrent ones, were sharply activated. Moreover, the range of their application increased including   358  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  the  tasks  of  function  approximation  and  extrapolation  and  the  systems’ dynamic control tasks. The neural networks with feedback  recurrent neural networks  are the natural control devices and nonlinear controlled object identification devices in the nonlinear systems of control. This is similar to the case of the linear systems of con- trol in which Z-filter is the linear control device and Z-transformation is the formal description of the controlled object. The neural network with feedback channels is a typical  example  of  how  the  structure  of  the  adjusted  multilayer  neural  network  is selected from the criterion of adequacy to the solution task but not from the simple fact that an author is familiar with this or that neural network structure. In case of a neural network with feedback channels, such additional problems for investigations emerge as the determination of the degree of an equivalent decrease in the number of neurons in the adjusted multilayer neural network after introducing the feedback into its structure.  Neural networks with variable  flexible  structure. Since the 1960s, the multilayer neu- ral networks with variable structure have been an effective tool in solving the task of pattern recognition [17-1]. This is the variant of the adjustment algorithms whose neural network structure  the number of neurons in the layers and the number of layers  grows in the process of adjustment up to a certain value of the solution quality index. The synthesis of the adjustment algorithms for the multilayer neural network with variable structure is a promising technique to solve a wide range of practical tasks.  Continual neural networks. Continual neural networks [17-3] are used mainly in two cases:   cid:1  When the number of indications in the layer is large;  cid:1  When the signal or pattern processing is performed on a real time basis and with-  out preliminary quantification of the input information.  It is shown in [17-2] that the neural network adjustment algorithms under the con- tinuum of indications or under the continuum of the neurons in the layer are the objects of independent consideration and research.  Complex neural networks. The input signals and the weighting coefficients in the neu- ral networks of this type are represented in the form of complex numbers, and all the operations in the open neural networks and in the adjustment algorithms include the complex numbers. This type of neural network is widely used for nonlinear signal processing.  Interval neural networks. In this case, the input signals are determined not by their values but rather by the interval to which they belong.  17.6.6 Remarks about the Activation Function Selection  The activation function selection is an important element of the neural network syn- thesis procedure. More than ten types of the neuron activation function are described   17.6  ·  Neural Network with Fixed Structure  359  in the known literature. Usually their selection is performed arbitrarily. In the studies [17-1, 17-2] the activation function  2 π arctg Bg was used, where g – is the analogous output signal of the neuron. At the end of the 1980s to the beginning of the 1990s, the sigmoid activation function became widely used. Wavelet and RBF networks are in fact the neural network with the activation function of a particular type.  As a rule, the introduction of the new peculiar type of the activation function rep- resents an attempt to make the neural network be more adequate to the solution task in order to decrease the number of neurons and adjusted coefficients. However, the desired goal is not always achieved because the task of the neural network adjustment simplification is also desired, in addition to the task of the simplification for the cal- culations of the output signal from the input signal. It is necessary to note that the complication of the activation function results in the sufficiently sharp complication of the adjustment algorithm due to the fact that the computational units for the activa- tion function derivatives’ calculations are used in the adjustment algorithm.  On the whole, at present, the problem of selection of the neurons’ activation func-  tion in the multilayer neural network is far from its solution.  17.6.7 Selection of the Multilayer Neural Network Structure According to its Hardware Implementation Technology  Some types of the open neural network structures are used due to the constraints of the neural network hardware implementation technology. The following neural net- works belong to this class:   cid:1  The neural networks with cross-connections  from the i-th to the i + 2,… layers  for the decrease of the number of the realized neurons with some increase of the num- ber of weight coefficients [17-2, 17-3];   cid:1  The neural networks that realize the feature continuum, the continuum of the neu- ron  number  in  the  layer,  etc.,  for  the  implementation  of  the  analog-to-digital neurocomputers and the signals and pattern processing [17-3];   cid:1  The neural networks with the weight coefficients of the finite digit capacity or with  the adaptation algorithms for the weight coefficient digit capacity control.  The  problem  of  the  weight  coefficient  digit  capacity  for  processing  signals  and patterns of different digit capacity representation is independent and very important. The low digit capacity of the weight coefficients results in additional errors, and the high digit capacity results in the high cost of the system and long processing time. This  problem  was  correctly  solved  in  the  implementation  of  the  linear  z-filter hardware using very large-scale IC IMS A100 of the Inmos firm in 1986. These very large-scale IC z-filters have the digit capacity that can be programmatically changed in  the  range  2 … 16  with  the  corresponding  decrease  of  the  processing  speed.  In nonlinear  filtering,  this  digit  capacity  can  be  changed  according  to  some  complex criterion. The problem of the adaptation algorithm development for the digit capac- ity control using very large-scale IC is the problem of future investigation. It emerges in the following domains:   360  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis   cid:1  The neural networks with the Boolean values of the weight coefficients for the sim- plification of the implementation of the open neural network. This simplification increases the number of neurons in the solution of the given quality;   cid:1  The neural networks without multiplier units because the multiplier units represent  the main difficulty of the hardware implementation;   cid:1  The neural networks with the limitations on the weight coefficients that must be considered during the formal description of the open neural network structure and during the adjustment algorithm development [17-2, 17-3].  The introduction of constraints on the open neural network structure is a very signifi- cant  problem  in  the  analogous,  analog-to-digital, optical,  molecular  and  quantum neurocomputers, as well as in the development of neurocomputers based on the single- electron nanocircuits.  17.6.8 Generation of the Secondary Optimization Functional in the Multilayer Neural Networks  In general, the primary optimization functional describes the neural network optimi- zation criterion implemented in the hardware level. In contrast, the secondary optimi- zation functional must be defined through the input and intermediate signals in the multilayer  neural  network  and  through  the  formal  description  of  the  open  neural network structure. In the simple case, the goal of the secondary optimization func- tional development is the development of the analytical transformation at the neural network output that provides the second distribution moment of the signal correspond- ing or equal to the primary optimization functional [17-2, 17-3].  17.6.9 Generation of the Algorithm of the Search Procedure for the Secondary Optimization Functional Extremum  During the period of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, neural networks were considered as the particular case of the nonlinear multi-dimensional object with the adjustable parameters implementing the adaptation self-learning control system.  In that period, the adaptation self-learning systems were developed mainly in the  following two domains:   cid:1  The search systems with artificial search oscillations of the adjustment parameters  for the following calculation of the optimization functional gradient;   cid:1  The analytical systems without artificial search oscillations of the adjustment param- eters. The optimization functional gradient was calculated directly through the cur- rent input and output neural network signals as in the particular object of control.  The analytical methods of self-learning were developed mainly in Russian investi- gations, though in the theory and practice of the self-learning automated control, the search methods were dominant.   17.6  ·  Neural Network with Fixed Structure  361  The following four variants of the secondary optimization functional gradient search  were used before 1974:   cid:1  Gradient method;  cid:1  Gradient method with the time averaging of the gradient value estimation;  cid:1  Gradient method with the constraints on the neural network weight coefficients;  cid:1  Combination of the random selection of the search initial conditions and the gra-  dient procedure for the search and analysis of the local extremum values.  The experience showed the high efficiency of the analytical search methods when the estimation of the secondary optimization functional gradient is performed by the current output and intermediate signals.  The main problems considered in the field of the secondary optimization functional extremum search are related to the fact that this functional is multi-extremal and it exists in a rather multi-dimensional space of the neural network adjustment coeffi- cients.  This is the reason that the modern neural network methods of the secondary opti- mization functional extremum search require the development in different directions, and some of them are described below.  17.6.9.1 The Control of Parameters in the Extremum Search Procedure for the Multi-Extremum Secondary Optimization Functional  The gradient local extremum search procedure for the multi-extremum optimization functional is a very important element of the multilayer neural network adjustment algorithm. In the simplest case, the weight coefficient K* at the functional gradient is determined in the empirical way in the process of solution of each specific task and is left constant in the adjustment procedure. Since the 1960s, researches have tried to make coefficient K* be variable  decreasing  with time during the adjustment proce- dure. This was done in order to decrease the adjustment error in the steady state. But this led to the significantly sharp increase in the adjustment duration  in the transient process of the multilayer neural network adjustment . At present, a considerable part of  this  problem  remains  open.  Some  efforts  are  made  to  control  the  value  of  the coefficient K* by the current error value and by the gradient functional.  17.6.9.2 The Modifications of the Global Extremum Search Algorithms for the Multi-Extremal Secondary Optimization Functional  The  secondary  optimization  functional  in  the  multilayer  neural  network  is  multi- extremal by definition. The reasons for this are the following:   cid:1  The input signal is rather complex  for example, the distribution of patterns aggre- gate in the multi-dimensional space of indications at the patterns’ recognition task solution is multi-modal ;   362  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis   cid:1  The variants of the task solution are multivariate;  cid:1  The open neural network structure is flexible.  The search methods for the global extremum  or, in addition, for several local ex-  trema  are at present only in the stage of formation.  One of such methods related to the set of ejections of the random initial conditions in the space of the neural network weight coefficients and to the search of the global extremum for the secondary optimization functional was presented and investigated in [17-2]. The convergence of the presented procedure by the number of initial condi- tions under the fixed number of local extrema was shown there. Some methods of this procedure resulting in the time decrease for the global extremum search are known. The method of “annealing” is an example.  The method of “annealing” can be used in the adjustment process in the following way. The independent variables  the neuron weights in the case of the neural network  undergo random changes. The values of the minimized neural network’s functional are stored for each changed set of variables, and then the best set is selected. A rela- tively large range of the random-value generator that changes the neuron weights is taken at the beginning of the process. The set of the variables’ values  weights  corre- sponding to the best functional value is then selected after several changes. And this set of variables is then taken as the initial one for the following procedure of random changes but with the decreased range of the random-value generator.  The gradient algorithm is effective in finding the local minimums in the case of neural network weight adjustment during the learning procedure. In general, the mix- ture of the “annealing” and gradient methods is the most effective algorithm. First, the “annealing” algorithm is used to find the initial weights. The gradient descent algo- rithm is used thereafter to bring the system to the nearest local minimum. Then the “annealing” algorithm is used at this point again in order to leave this local minimum. These  stages  are  repeated  until  one  has  the  possibility  to  leave  the  recurrent  local minimum. In the latter case, it can be considered that the global minimum is obtained.  17.6.9.3 Filtering and Extrapolation of the Signal corresponding to the Estimation of the Secondary Optimization Functional Gradient  As a rule, the decision to change the weight coefficients in the known neural network adaptation algorithms is taken in each operation cycle according to the results of one single pattern passing through the network. The experience of using the filter with the ≠ 1 [17-2] in the adjustment circuit showed the increase in the adjustment memory mn effectiveness for stationary and non-stationary patterns at the multilayer neural net- work input. Some attempts to speed up the learning process through the application of the weight coefficients’ extrapolation procedure during the neural network adjustment are known from the literature. The filter synthesis in the weight coefficients’ adjust- ment circuit is poorly investigated though it is a perspective algorithm in the general procedure of the multilayer neural network synthesis.  The following parameters must be determined in the process of the multilayer neural  network adjustment algorithm:   17.6  ·  Neural Network with Fixed Structure  363   cid:1  The filter memory;  cid:1  The filter type according to the a priori selected form of the neural network input  signal nonstationarity.  17.6.9.4 The Multilayer Neural Network Adaptation Algorithms with the Adjustment of the Coefficients for the “Slope” of the Activation Function  When using the activation function with a variable “slope,” the separate neuron in the neural network is described by the expression  It is seen therefore that there is no sense in organizing the adjustment circuit for the coefficients B and ai at the construction of adaptation algorithms. In the neural network consisting of the neuron set that contains a separate neuron subset or all the sets with the activation function of the same “slope,” the organization of the adjustment circuit for the coefficient B, as well as for the separate coefficients, is necessary in order to decrease the whole adjustment duration, i.e., to decrease the time required for the task solution.  17.6.9.5 About the Use of the Second Derivative of the Secondary Optimization Functional  The multilayer neural network adjustment algorithms with the use of the second de- rivative of the secondary optimization functional were developed at the end of the 1960s. The works of the 1990s did not contribute significantly in this field. However, at the beginning of the 1970s, the experiments using the second derivatives showed that the noise level in this case is very high and the use of the second derivative becomes inefficient. At present, this situation is the same.  17.6.9.6 Selection of the Initial Conditions for the Gradient Procedure of the Extremum Search of the Secondary Optimization Functional  The choice of the initial weight coefficients of the adaptive neural network is an im- portant condition to speed up the task solution procedure. Therefore, from our point of view, the widespread approach to choose the zero values for the weight coefficients or the random values with the uniform distribution in the given turn-down as the initial conditions is incorrect.  Even during the solution of the problem of recognition of two pattern classes, it was clear that the initial weight coefficient values must be selected by generating the dividing surface configuration, implemented by the neural network, in the form of a multidimen- sional “chess-board” with the uniform distribution of “black” and “white” squares. Each color corresponds to the first and second classes of patterns in the physically implemented multidimensional space of indications [17-2, 17-3]. Such a multidimensional “chess-board” is formed by the hyperplanes corresponding to the neurons of the first layer.   364  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  The initial weight coefficients of the adaptive neural network can also be chosen as the weight coefficients of the neural network with variable structure after its learning stage termination. As it was mentioned above, this is possible only for the pattern rec- ognition solution and for clasterization  self-learning  with the developed adjustment algorithms for the multilayer neural networks with flexible structure.  The problem of function approximation  extrapolation  is an example of the effective solution of the problem of the initial weight coefficients’ selection for the multilayer neural network adjustment. In this case, assuming that the neural network is an effective nonlinear filter  extrapolator , it is expedient to choose the weight coefficients of the neural network implementing the equivalent nonlinear filter or extrapolator as the initial conditions.  Hence, the choice of the initial conditions for the multilayer neural network adjust-  ment possesses the following properties:   cid:1  It is specific for each specific task that is solved by the neural network;  cid:1  It is aimed at the acceleration of the adjustment process  and therefore at the accel- eration of the task solution  by putting the neural network into the domain of the global extremum of the secondary optimization functional;   cid:1  As a result, it allows one to increase the equivalent ratio between productivity and  the cost during the specific task solution.  The examples of the particular solutions for the problem of the initial condition  choice are given in [17-7].  17.6.10 Formation of the Adaptation Algorithms in the Multilayer Neural Networks  The base for the formation of the adjustment  adaptation  algorithms in the multi- layer neural networks includes   cid:1  The analytical expression for the secondary optimization functional and the analytical expression for its first derivative or the estimation of the sign of the first derivative;  cid:1  The  analytical  expression  for  the  secondary  optimization  functional  extremum search with the use of its first derivative expressed through the input and output signals of the adjusted multilayer neural network.  17.7 Verification of the Adjusted Multilayer Neural Network  The elaboration of the special test system for the neural networks with different structures is an important element for the increase in the reliability of prospective neurocomputers. The development of such tests for the adjusted neural network is a branch of the perspec- tive investigations in the neural network theory domain. This section relates both to the neural networks with variable structure as well as to those with fixed structure.  The elaboration of the typical neural network input signal classes is necessary for the objective test of the adaptive neural network performance quality. Furthermore, the system of tests is always specific for the specific solution task.   The class of signals with Laplace transformation  17.8  ·  Elaboration of the Plan of Experiments  365  is a typical example of the neural network input signal class. In this case, the test of the control system performance quality is carried out by the feed of the corresponding typical signals  δ-function, unit step, linear signal, etc.  to the system input with the following analysis of the transient process and of the error in the terminal steady state  the order of the control system astaticism .  The typical neural network input signal class must always possess some parameter characterizing the complexity of the solution task. This parameter is apparent in the aforementioned example. As far back as the beginning of the 1960s, for the pattern recognition tasks oriented onto the performance with the random samples of complex unknown multi-modal distributions, the random samples of multi-modal distributions were suggested as typical neural network input signals. Hence, the distribution modes represented  a  normal  distribution  and  the  mode  centers  were  situated  along  the hyperbisector of the multidimensional space of indications alternating for each class [17-2, 17-3]. Two parameters were taken as the solution task complexity indexes, namely the number of the distribution modes and the variance of each separate mode. The indications of the modes belonging to the specific class in the case of a self-learning neural network performance mode were absent.  The selection of the typical neural network input signal class is an important task for the researcher who desires to demonstrate, more or less objectively, the advantages of his neural network algorithm elaborated for the solution of the specific formulated task. The typical neural network input signal class must always possess some parameter characteriz- ing the complexity of the solution task. This parameter is apparent in the aforementioned example. As far back as the beginning of the 1960s, for the pattern recognition tasks ori- ented onto the performance with the random samples of complex unknown multi-modal distributions, the random samples of multi-modal distributions were suggested as typical neural network input signals. Hence the distribution modes represented a normal distri- bution, and the mode centers were situated along the hyperbisector of the multidimen- sional space of indications alternating for each class [17-2, 17-3]. Two parameters were taken as the solution task complexity indexes, namely the number of the distribution modes and the variance of each separate mode. The indications of the modes belonging to the specific class in the case of a self-learning neural network performance mode were absent. The selection of the typical neural network input signal class is an important task for the researcher who desires to demonstrate, more or less objectively, the advantages of his neural network algorithm elaborated for the solution of the specific formulated task.  17.8 Elaboration of the Plan of Experiments  All the undefined parameters of the neural network and the input and output test signals must be taken into account during the elaboration of the plan of experiments. These parameters must be ordered and represented in the form of the experimental plan with the elaborated neural network solution algorithm.   366  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  The problem of the small-size sample of the input signal presented to the neural network for its training must be considered separately. This problem is a significant problem in the large number of information processes aimed at decision making. This problem was also significant in the process of standard statistical decision making. However, in this case, the strict limitations related to the small-size sample made it necessary to take into account the a priori information concerning the distribution function of the processed signals. The neural network methods of the information processing were elaborated namely because this a priori information is absent and therefore the distribution functions can be very different, complex or unknown.  The problem of the small-size sample is very significant in the following two cases:  1. When the number of measurements is small and cannot be increased in principle; 2. When the number of measurements is increasing but the decision must be made as  far as the measurement results are obtained.  We present below the part of the technique for planning of experiments. This part deals with the specific multilayer neural network performance under the conditions of the small-size learning sample for the adjustment of the multilayer neural network with fixed structure:  1. The procedure of multiple repetition of the sample with a relatively small size on the input of the neural network is an effective technique to increase the adequacy of decision making by the multilayer neural network. The adequacy of decision means the estimation of the correct recognition probability, the mean-square error of the function approximation, or any other evaluation depending on the task that the multilayer neural network solves;  2. One of the possible ways the neural network is implemented for the property of generalization by the similarity is the artificial generation of additional samples on the neural network input. Moreover, the additional samples must possess the math- ematical expectation in the form of initial small-size sample components, and they must have a different variance. With that, the value of the variance may change in the process of execution in the plan of experiments;  3. The initial conditions’ selection at the multilayer neural network adjustment is a very important problem that actively influences the speed of computations in the neural network logical basis  the speed of the adjustment algorithms’ convergence with one of the local extrema or with the global extremum of the optimization functional  and the quality of the task solution. Under the different methods of the initial conditions’ selection, each time different adjustment results will be obtained. Averaging across the results will give thereafter, at the limited specified sample, additional information about the neural network performance quality. In this case, the initial conditions can be taken either randomly  by the initial weight coefficient generation through the random-value generator  or by calculation across the lim- ited sample with the help of the adjustment algorithms with variable structure;  4. The division of the initial sample into the smaller samples, the multilayer neural network adjustment with the use of technique mentioned in points 2 and 3, and the results’ averaging across the set of the mentioned smaller parts of the initial sample   17.9  ·  Importance of Unification of Designations in the Synthesis of Neural Network Adjustment  367  can be regarded as an additional method to analyze the neural network generaliza- tion properties;  5. The resultant stage of the suggested technique is the stage of the averaging of the adjustment results across the set of variants mentioned in points 2, 3 and 4. The obtained distribution function for the quality index will have some mathematical expectation and variance. The mathematical expectation of the quality index is the main characteristic of the multilayer neural network operation with the sample of the ultimate object. The value of the quality index variance is the evaluation of its uncertainty. At the high value of the obtained variance, one must undertake some efforts that would result in the improvement of the solution quality. One of such possible efforts consists in the increase of the structure complexity of the multilayer neural network.  One can use methods mentioned in points 2 and 4 when operating with the small-  size sample in the case of the multilayer neural network with flexible structure.  The presented technique is an illustration of the possibility to partially compensate the shortage of the experimental information by the additional computational resource. This technique can be used not only for the recognition pattern or function approxi- mation task solutions under the relatively small number of the experimental observa- tions but also for the general task solutions.  17.9 About the Importance of the Unification of Designations in the Process of Synthesis of the Neural Network Adjustment Algorithms  The investigations in this field show that the understanding of the essence of the stud- ies and of the peculiarities in the different algorithmic approaches will be much more transparent in the case of some unification of designations in the scientific literature. We present below some version of such a unification.  Designations  – the neural network input signal;  x N – the dimensionality of the feature space; w – the neural network weight coefficient; – the number of the feature  i = 0, …, N ; i g – the analogous output signal of the neuron  the input signal of the unit imple-  menting the activation function after the multi-input summation unit ;  – the output signal of the neuron or the neural network;  y K – the number of classes; Kp – the number of solutions; f  g  – the activation function; H1 – the number of neurons in the first layer; W – the number of layers in the multilayer neural network; Hw –  w = 1, …, W  – the number of neurons in the m-th layer of the multilayer neu-  ral network.   368  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  17.10 About Myths in Neural Network Theory  Fuzzy logic is one of the bases of neural network theory development. The neural network  is  one  of  the  most  efficient  methods  for  the  implementation  of  the  fuzzy logic concept.  Along with that, different scientific fields emerge in neural network theory develop- ment. But the detailed analysis shows that these fields are only some narrow and par- ticular case of the separate aspects of neural network theory. Therefore, we propose discussing some of the definitions, such as   cid:1  Genetic algorithms;  cid:1  Support vector machines;  cid:1  Wavelet networks;  cid:1  RBF-networks;  cid:1  Principle component analysis;  cid:1  Evolutionary programming.  The attempts to pull out some parts of the neural network theory and to make them independent only weaken these parts. The aforementioned list shows the examples of such neural network theory divisions.  The same particular interpretations of the neural network theory are the classic methods of the mathematical statistics and methods of the potential functions that were actively discussed at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s.  The main idea consists in the proposition to transform the earlier suggestions con- cerning the “emotional” definition of the algorithm and the similar suggestions that will be made in the future for some vector of quantitative parameters with the corresponding quantitative explanation of why the new algorithm changes this or that parameter.  Such a qualitative description can be made for the various known neural network types:   cid:1  Kohonen networks;  cid:1  Elman networks;  cid:1  Hopfield networks;  cid:1  ART neural network, etc.  17.11 Conclusion  In this case, the  quantitative limitation of the different neural networks will be  immediately seen for their users.  In this section, we represent the most optimal, from our point of view, design cycle for the neural network solution algorithms that can be implemented at present.  The number of investigations in the domain of the neural network theory is in- creasing. This strengthens the requirements for the comparison and the detailed clas- sification of the different neural network synthesis algorithms. It must be done by means   17.11  ·  Conclusion  369  of the comparison of the a priori information on the neural network synthesis in each particular case.  1. A priori characteristics of the neural network “supervisor instruction” space, i.e.,  the number of the pattern classes  two, Κ, continuum ;  2. A priori characteristics of the neural network input signal nonstationarity; 3. The two-argument function of the “supervisor qualification” of the neural network.  The arguments are the indexes of the corresponding classes;  4. The function of the “supervisor’s own opinion” about its abilities. This is also the two-argument function with the arguments that are the indexes of the correspond- ing classes;  5. A priori probabilities of the classes’ emergence; 6. A priori characteristics of the neural network solution space  two, Κ  p, continuum of  solutions ;  7. The class of criteria for the primary neural network optimization; 8.

A priori information about the class of structures during the development of the  neural network with flexible structure;  12.A priori information about the difference between the primary and secondary op- timization functionals during the development of the neural network with fixed structure that is tuned through the closed-cycle procedure;  13.A priori information about the method of searching of the secondary optimization  functional extremum;  14.A priori information about the limitations on the adjustment coefficients; 15.A priori information about the procedure of selection of the elements of the para- metric matrix  K* of the search system for the secondary optimization functional extremum;  16.A priori information about the search oscillation parameters in the case of when the neural network adaptation algorithm cannot be designed in the analytical form;  17.A priori information about the initial conditions for the adjustment procedure; 18.A priori information about the class of the typical neural network input signals; 19.A priori information about the degree of complication of the open neural network  structure on each iteration step and about the form of this complication.  The objective comparison between the multilayer neural networks of different types must be performed through the comparison of the a priori information about their design and the comparison of their performance quality with the typical and real in- put signals.  Table 17.1 shows the comparison of the neural network synthesis procedures de- scribed in [17-2, 17-3] and in the large number of American studies concerning the error back-propagation methods.   370  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis   17.11  ·  Conclusion  371   372  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  e h t   r o f   e r u t c u r t s   e l c y c   n g i s e D  n o i t a c i l p p a k r o w t e n       l a r u e n  .  .  2 7 1    .  g F  i   17.11  ·  Conclusion  373   374  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  Figure 17.2 represents the structure of the neural network synthesis for the solu- tion  algorithms.  This  structure  was  developed  for  several  years.  On  the  one  hand, it includes the results of the large number of investigations that are represented by their  authors  as “a  new  method…”  or “original  approach…”.  However,  these  ap- proaches are rather particular. On the other hand, this structure is incomplete and represents only the additional line in the neural network theory that might not be known to the author.  However, the author does not consider each new study that comes in his sight, from the point of view reflected in this figure. And he asks himself if this new study might be the particular case of some already known works. This was the reason for writing the aforementioned section “About Myths in the Neural Network Theory”. At any rate, the author conceives all the works that further develop the structure shown in Fig. 17.2 with great satisfaction.  When considering the neural network solution algorithms, the problem of a so- called “false” statement of the mathematical problem often arises. Let us explain it in some examples. The solution of the systems of the linear algebraic equations is some- times considered as the problem of the matrix inversion in the classical mathematic approach. However, the neural network algorithms for the solution of these two prob- lems are very different. And the problem of the matrix inversion becomes not neces- sary, i.e., this problem becomes “false”. A similar situation is observed in the problem of solution of the systems of the ordinary nonlinear differential equations. These equa- tions are the formalized description of the behavior of physical objects. The use of the neurocomputers eliminates both the necessity of the formalized description of the physical objects as well as the necessity of the solution of the systems of the ordinary nonlinear differential equations. In this case, the formalized description of the physical objects is performed by the use of the neural networks of different structures. Namely due to this reason, the neural network control decreases significantly the interest in the solution of the systems of the ordinary nonlinear differential equations.  Neuromathematics establishes some new problems for computational mathematics that either were not solved before or were solved insufficiently. Some of these problems are the following:   cid:1  The initial condition selection;  cid:1  The universalization of the different problem solution algorithms;  cid:1  The selection of the classes of typical input signals for the test  verification  of the  neural network performance quality;   cid:1  The selection and rejection of the “false” problem statements;  cid:1  The investigation and dynamic control of the solution procedure;  cid:1  The problem of the number of solutions related to the multi-extremum properties  of the optimization functional.  The development of the neural network solution algorithms allows for the efficient selection of the initial conditions as well  as for the use of several methods for the dynamic control of the problem solving procedure including the control of the rate of convergence:   17.11  ·  Conclusion  375   cid:1  The control of parameters  the modification selection  of the iteration procedure for the multi-extremum optimization functional search in the problem solving pro- cess;   cid:1  The filtering and extrapolation of the signal corresponding to the estimation of the  optimization functional gradient in the problem solving process;   cid:1  The adjustment of the multilayer neural network’s activation function slope;  cid:1  The selection and analysis of the special structures of the neural networks adequate to the class of the solved problems  cellular-like or continuum neural networks, neural networks with lateral, random and feedback coupling, neural networks with flexible structure .  The problem of the number of solutions in the algorithms development is very important. In the case of the neural network algorithms, this problem is related to the multi-extremum characteristics of the optimization functional and to the possibility of the formation of the multi-extremum functional through the variation of the open neural network structure.  The neural network theory at the present time represents an independent field of science. The main prospective lines of the neural network theory relate to the solution of the complex practical problems. Some of them are the following:   cid:1  The  continuum  neural  networks  with  the  formal  consideration  of  the  con- tinuum number of the input signals, of the input channels or of the neurons in the layers;   cid:1  The investigation of the structural or parametric reliability of the neural networks  used in the neurocomputer implementation technology;   cid:1  The parallelizing of the neural network algorithms for the different types of the  commutation kernels in the super-neurocomputers;   cid:1  The  neural  networks  that  provide  the  invariance  to  the  group  of  transforma- tions   for  example,  the  scale-invariance  or  signal-invariance,  Lorentz  invari- ance, etc. ;   cid:1  The analytical description of the neural networks with continuum adaptation using  the apparatus of the linear sequential Gill machines, etc.  Unfortunately, perhaps due to poor awareness, a large number of “home-bred” neural network algorithms emerge. The achievement of the first positive results on the basis of these algorithms can provoke an illusion about the “completeness” of the neural network theory. However, this theory is only in the initial phase of its development. Evidently, in the present work, the entire list of neural network theory problems is not all enumerated. The gradual progress in this domain must improve the solution of the vast number of existent problems as well as pose new problems. We consider that the neural networks will be the foremost essential tool for the investigation of complex problems of the modern world.  The  present  study  was  performed  in  the  framework  of  the  state  agreement with  the  Federal Agency  for  Science  and  Innovations  in  the  development  works No. 02.435.11.1003.   376  Chapter 17  ·  Methods of Problem Solving in the Neural Network Logical Basis  References  [17-1] Galushkin AI  1970  Multilayer systems of pattern recognition, Moscow: MIEM [17-2] Galushkin AI  1974  Synthesis of multilayer systems for pattern recognition.

Neurocomputer 5   Conclusion  Neural network theory is an independent branch of science at present. The main per- spective lines of the neural network theory relate to the solution of complex practical problems. The following fundamental problems can be mentioned:   cid:1  Continuum neural networks with a formally considered continuum of input chan-  nels, neurons in the layers, etc.;   cid:1  Neural network reliability;  cid:1  Neural  networks  providing  the  invariance  to  the  group  of  transformations   for  example, to the shift, rotation, patterns or signal scaling ;   cid:1  Analytical description of neural networks with adaptation circuits using technique  of Gill linear sequential machines, etc.  The number of scientific investigations in the field of neural network theory is in- creasing. That is why the analytical approach is required for detailed classification of different methods for the neural network synthesis problem solutions. And the most important domain for the application of such approaches is the selection of the a priori information required for the multilayer neural network synthesis in each particular case.  1. A priori characteristics of the neural network teacher instruction space – the num-  ber of pattern classes  2, K, continuum ;  2. A priori nonstationary characteristics of the neural network input signal; 3. Neural network teacher qualification function of two arguments representing the  indexes of corresponding classes;  4. Function of “teacher’s slant about his capabilities” of the neural network. This is also a function of two arguments representing the indexes of corresponding classes;  5. A priori probabilities of classes’ appearance; 6. A priori characteristics of the neural network solution space  2, Kp, continuum ; 7. Class of the neural network primary optimization criteria; 8. Function of losses that take place when the system considers a pattern to belong to  a wrong class;  9. A priori information about conditional distribution functions f ′ x ε ; 10.A priori information about the fixed structure of the open-loop neural network in the design of the neural network with fixed structure adjustable in the closed cycle; 11.A priori information about the structure class in the design of the neural network  with flexible structure;   378  Conclusion  12.A priori information about the distinguishing features of the primary and second- ary functionals in the design of the neural network with fixed structure adjustable in the closed cycle;  13.A priori information about a search method for the secondary optimization func-  tional;  the adjustable coefficients;  14.A priori information about the presence and form of the constraints imposed upon  15.A priori information about a selection method for the coefficients of the parametric  matrix K* of the secondary optimization functional extremum search system;  16.A priori information about the search oscillation parameters in the case of when the neural network adaptation algorithm cannot be designed in the form of the analytical system;  17.A priori information about the initial conditions for the adjustment procedure; 18.A priori information about the class of the neural network’s typical input signals; 19.A priori information about the degree of the open-loop neural network structure complication at each step and about a method of such a complication realization;  The objective comparison between the multilayer neural networks of different types must be performed on the basis of comparison of the available a priori information for their design and their operation quality at the typical and real input signals.

This book, written by a leader in neural network theory in Russia, uses mathematical methods in combination with complexity theory, nonlinear dynamics and optimization. It details more than 40 years of Soviet and Russian neural network research and presents a systematized methodology of neural networks synthesis. The theory is expansive: covering not just traditional topics such as network architecture but also neural continua in function spaces as well.
