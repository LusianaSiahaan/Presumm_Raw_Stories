One step further, patterns are templates for solving categories of problems. Patterns help you split a problem into Lego-like blocks and focus on the unique parts of the problem while abstracting out a lot of “been there, done that, got the T-shirt” kind of details. Patterns also help us communicate better by simply providing a common vocabulary. It’s therefore important to identify and study patterns.  Target Audience This book is not a beginner’s book; it’s targeted at professional developers and pro- grammers who want to take their JavaScript skills to the next level. Some of the basics  like loops, conditionals, and closures  are not discussed at all. If you find you need to brush up on some of those topics, refer to the list of suggested reading. At the same time, some topics  such as object creation or hoisting  may look too basic to be in this book, but they are discussed from a patterns perspective and, in my opinion, are critical to harnessing the power of the language. If  you’re  looking  for  best  practices  and  powerful  patterns  to  help  you  write  better, maintainable, robust JavaScript code, this book is for you.

Reading This is not a beginner’s book and some basic topics such as loops and conditions are skipped. If you need to learn more about the language, following are some suggested titles:    Object-Oriented JavaScript by yours truly  Packt Publishing    JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan  O’Reilly    JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford  O’Reilly    Pro JavaScript Design Patterns by Ross Hermes and Dustin Diaz  Apress    High Performance JavaScript by Nicholas Zakas  O’Reilly    Professional JavaScript for Web Developers by Nicholas Zakas  Wrox   xvi   Preface   CHAPTER 1 Introduction  JavaScript is the language of the Web. It started as a way to manipulate a few selected types of elements in a web page  such as images and form fields , but it has grown tremendously.  In  addition  to  client-side  browser  scripting,  these  days  you  can  use JavaScript to program for an increasing variety of platforms. You can write server-side code  using .NET or Node.js , desktop applications  that work on all operating sys- tems  and application extensions  e.g., for Firefox or Photoshop , mobile applications, and command-line scripts. JavaScript is also an unusual language. It doesn’t have classes, and functions are first- class objects used for many tasks. Initially the language was considered deficient by many developers, but in more recent years these sentiments have changed. Interest- ingly, languages such as Java and PHP started adding features such as closures and anonymous functions, which JavaScript developers have been enjoying and taking for granted for a while. JavaScript is dynamic enough that you can make it look and feel like another language you’re already comfortable with. But the better approach is to embrace its differences and study its specific patterns.  Patterns A pattern in the broader sense of the word is a “theme of recurring events or objects… it can be a template or model which can be used to generate things”  http:  en.wikipedia .org wiki Pattern . In software development, a pattern is a solution to a common problem. A pattern is not necessarily a code solution ready for copy-and-paste but more of a best practice, a useful abstraction, and a template for solving categories of problems.  1   It is important to identify patterns because:    They help us write better code using proven practices and not reinvent the wheel.   They provide a level of abstraction—the brain can hold only so much at a given time, so when you think about a more complex problem, it helps if you don’t bother with the low-level details but account for them with self-contained building blocks  patterns .    They improve communication between developers and teams, which are often in remote locations and don’t communicate face to face. Simply putting a label on some coding technique or approach makes it easier to make sure we’re talking about the same thing. For example, it’s easier to say  and think  “immediate func- tion,” than “this thing where you wrap the function in parentheses and at the end of it put another set of parentheses to invoke the function right where you’ve de- fined it.”  This book discusses the following types of patterns:    Design patterns   Coding patterns   Antipatterns  Design patterns are those initially defined by the “Gang of Four” book  named so after its four authors , originally published in distant 1994 under the title Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. Examples of design patterns are sin- gleton,  factory,  decorator,  observer,  and  so  on.  The  thing  about  design  patterns  in relation to JavaScript is that, although language-independent, the design patterns were mostly studied from the perspective of strongly typed languages, such as C++ and Java. Sometimes it doesn’t necessarily make sense to apply them verbatim in a loosely typed dynamic language such as JavaScript. Sometimes these patterns are workarounds that deal with the strongly typed nature of the languages and the class-based inheritance. In JavaScript there might be simpler alternatives. This book discusses JavaScript im- plementations of several design patterns in Chapter 7. The coding patterns are much more interesting; they are JavaScript-specific patterns and good practices related to the unique features of the language, such as the various uses of functions. JavaScript coding patterns are the main topic of the book. You might come across an occasional antipattern in the book. Antipatterns have a bit of negative or even insulting sound to their name, but that needn’t be the case. An antipattern is not the same as a bug or a coding error; it’s just a common approach that causes more problems than it solves. Antipatterns are clearly marked with a comment in the code.  2  Chapter 1: Introduction   JavaScript: Concepts Let’s quickly go over a few important concepts that provide a context for the following chapters.  Object-Oriented JavaScript is an object-oriented language, which often surprises developers who have previously looked at the language and dismissed it. Anything you look at in a piece of JavaScript code has a good chance of being an object. Only five primitive types are not objects: number, string, boolean, null, and undefined, and the first three have corre- sponding object representation in the form of primitive wrappers  discussed in the next chapter . Number, string, and boolean primitive values are easily converted to objects either by the programmer or sometimes behind the scenes by the JavaScript interpreter. Functions are objects, too. They can have properties and methods. The simplest thing you do in any language is define a variable. Well, in JavaScript when you define a variable, you’re already dealing with objects. First, the variable automat- ically becomes a property of an internal object known as an Activation Object  or a property of the global object if it’s a global variable . Second, this variable is actually also object-like because it has its own properties  called attributes , which determine whether the variable can be changed, deleted, or enumerated in a for-in loop. These attributes are not directly exposed in ECMAScript 3, but edition 5 offers special de- scriptor methods for manipulating them. So what are the objects? Because they do so many things they must be quite special. Actually they are extremely simple. An object is just a collection of named properties, a list of key-value pairs  almost identical to an associative array in other languages . Some of the properties could be functions  function objects , in which case we call them methods. Another thing about the objects you create is that you can modify them at any time.  Although ECMAScript 5 introduces APIs to prevent mutations.  You can take an ob- ject and add, remove, and update its members. If you’re concerned about privacy and access, we’ll see patterns for this as well. And one last thing to keep in mind is that there are two main types of objects:  Native  Host  Described in the ECMAScript standard  Defined by the host environment  for example, the browser environment   The native objects can further be categorized as built-in  for example, Array, Date  or user-defined  var o = {}; .   JavaScript: Concepts   3   Host objects are, for example, window and all the DOM objects. If you’re wondering whether you’re using host objects, try running your code in a different, nonbrowser environment. If it works fine, you’re probably using only native objects.  No Classes You’ll see this statement repeated on several occasions throughout the book: There are no classes in JavaScript. This is a novel concept to seasoned programmers in other languages  and  it  takes  more  than  a  few  repetitions  and  more  than  a  little  effort  to “unlearn” classes and accept that JavaScript deals only with objects. Not having classes makes your programs shorter—you don’t need to have a class to create an object. Consider this Java-like object creation:     Java object creation HelloOO hello_oo = new HelloOO  ;  Repeating the same thing three times looks like an overhead when it comes to creating simple objects. And more often than not, we want to keep our objects simple. In JavaScript you create a blank object when you need one and then start adding in- teresting members to it. You compose objects by adding primitives, functions, or other objects to them as their properties. A “blank” object is not entirely blank; it comes with a few built-in properties already but has no “own” properties. We talk about this more in the next chapter. One of the general rules in the Gang of Four book says, “Prefer object composition to class inheritance.” This means that if you can create objects out of available pieces you have lying around, this is a much better approach than creating long parent-child in- heritance chains and classifications. In JavaScript it’s easy to follow this advice—simply because there are no classes and object composition is what you do anyway.  Prototypes JavaScript does have inheritance, although this is just one way to reuse code.  And there’s an entire chapter on code reuse.  Inheritance can be accomplished in various ways, which usually make use of prototypes. A prototype is an object  no surprises  and every function you create automatically gets a prototype property that points to a new blank object. This object is almost identical to an object created with an object literal or Object   constructor, except that its constructor property points to the function you create and not to the built-in Object  . You can add members to this blank object and later have other objects inherit from this object and use its properties as their own. We’ll discuss inheritance in detail, but for now just keep in mind that the prototype is an object  not a class or anything special  and every function has a prototype property.  4  Chapter 1: Introduction   Environment JavaScript programs need an environment to run. The natural habitat for a JavaScript program is the browser, but that’s not the only environment. The patterns in the book are  mostly  related  to  the  core  JavaScript   ECMAScript   so  they  are  environment- agnostic. Exceptions are:    Chapter 8, which specifically deals with browser patterns   Some other examples that illustrate practical applications of a pattern  Environments can provide their own host objects, which are not defined in the ECMA- Script standard and may have unspecified and unexpected behavior.  ECMAScript 5 The core JavaScript programming language  excluding DOM, BOM, and extra host objects  is based on the ECMAScript standard, or ES for short. Version 3 of the standard was accepted officially in 1999 and is the one currently implemented across browsers. Version 4 was abandoned and version 5 was approved December 2009, 10 years after the previous. Version 5 adds some new built-in objects, methods, and properties to the language, but its most important addition is the so-called strict mode, which actually removes features from the language, making the programs simpler and less error-prone. For example the usage of the with statement has been disputed over the years. Now in ES5 strict mode it raises an error, although it’s okay if found in nonstrict mode. The strict mode is triggered by an ordinary string, which older implementations of the language simply ignore. This means that the usage of strict mode is backward compatible, be- cause it won’t raise errors in older browsers that don’t understand it. Once per scope  either function scope, global scope, or at the beginning of a string passed to eval   , you can use the following string:  function my   {     "use strict";        rest of the function... }  This means the code in the function is executed in the strict subset of the language. For older browsers this is just a string not assigned to any variable, so it’s not used, and yet it’s not an error. The plan for the language is that in the future strict mode will be the only one allowed. In this sense ES5 is a transitional version—developers are encouraged, but not forced, to write code that works in strict mode.  ECMAScript 5  5   The book doesn’t explore patterns related to ES5’s specific additions, because at the time of this writing there’s no browser that implements ES5. But the examples in this book promote a transition to the new standard by:    Ensuring the offered code samples will not raise errors in strict mode   Avoiding and pointing out deprecated constructs such as arguments.callee   Calling out ES3 patterns that have ES5 built-in equivalents such as Object.create    JSLint JavaScript is an interpreted language with no static compile-time checks. So it’s possible to deploy a broken program with a simple typing mistake without realizing it. This is where JSLint helps. JSLint  http:  jslint.com  is a JavaScript code quality tool created by Douglas Crockford that inspects your code and warns about potential problems. It’s highly recommended that you run your code through JSLint. The tool “will hurt your feelings” as its creator warns, but only in the beginning. You can quickly learn from your mistakes and adopt the essential habits of a professional JavaScript programmer. Having no JSLint error in your code also helps you be more confident in the code, knowing that you didn’t make a simple omission or syntax error in a hurry. Starting with the next chapter, you’ll see JSLint mentioned a lot. All the code in the book successfully passes JSLint’s check  with the default settings, current at the time of writing  except for a few occasions clearly marked as antipatterns. In its default settings, JSLint expects your code to be strict mode–compliant.  The Console The console object is used throughout the book. This object is not part of the language but part of the environment and is present in most current browsers. In Firefox, for example, it comes with the Firebug extension. The Firebug console has a UI that enables you  to  quickly  type  and  test  little  pieces  of  JavaScript  code  and  also  play  with  the currently loaded page  see Figure 1-1 . It’s also highly recommended as a learning and exploratory  tool.  Similar  functionality  is  available  in  WebKit  browsers   Safari  and Chrome   as  part  of  the  Web  Inspector  and  in  IE  starting  with  version  8  as  part  of Developer Tools. Most  code  examples  in  the  book  use  the  console  object  instead  of  prompting alert  s or updating the current page, because it’s an easy and unobtrusive way to print some output.  6  Chapter 1: Introduction   Figure 1-1. Using the Firebug console  We often use the method log  , which prints all the parameters passed to it, and some- times dir  , which enumerates the object passed to it and prints all properties. Here’s an example usage:  console.log "test", 1, {}, [1,2,3] ; console.dir {one: 1, two: {three: 3}} ;  When you type in the console, you don’t have to use console.log  ; you can simply omit it. To avoid clutter, some code snippets skip it, too, and assume you’re testing the code in the console:  window.name === window['name'];    true  This is as if we used the following:  console.log window.name === window['name'] ;  and it printed true in the console.  The Console  7    CHAPTER 2 Essentials  This chapter discusses essential best practices, patterns, and habits for writing high- quality JavaScript code, such as avoiding globals, using single var declarations, pre- caching length in loops, following coding conventions, and more. The chapter also includes  some  habits  not  necessarily  related  to  the  code  itself,  but  more  about  the overall code creation process, including writing API documentation, conducting peer reviews, and running JSLint. These habits and best practices can help you write better, more understandable, and maintainable code—code to be proud of  and be able to figure out  when revisiting it months and years down the road.  Writing Maintainable Code Software bugs are costly to fix. And their cost increases over time, especially if the bugs creep into the publicly released product. It’s best if you can fix a bug right away, as soon you find it; this is when the problem your code solves is still fresh in your head. Otherwise you move on to other tasks and forget all about that particular code. Revis- iting the code after some time has passed requires:    Time to relearn and understand the problem   Time to understand the code that is supposed to solve the problem  Another  problem,  specific  to  bigger  projects  or  companies,  is  that  the  person  who eventually fixes the bug is not the same person who created the bug  and also not the same person who found the bug . It’s therefore critical to reduce the time it takes to understand code, either written by yourself some time ago or written by another de- veloper in the team. It’s critical to both the bottom line  business revenue  and the developer’s happiness, because we would all rather develop something new and excit- ing instead of spending hours and days maintaining old legacy code. Another fact of life related to software development in general is that usually more time is spent reading code than writing it. In times when you’re focused and deep into a problem, you can sit down and in one afternoon create a considerable amount of code.  9   The code will probably work then and there, but as the application matures, many other things happen that require your code to be reviewed, revised, and tweaked. For example:    Bugs are uncovered.   New features are added to the application.   The application needs to work in new environments  for example, new browsers  appear on the market .    The code gets repurposed.   The code gets completely rewritten from scratch or ported to another architecture  or even another language.  As a result of the changes, the few man-hours spent writing the code initially end up in man-weeks spent reading it. That’s why creating maintainable code is critical to the success of an application. Maintainable code means code that:    Is readable   Is consistent   Is predictable   Looks as if it was written by the same person   Is documented  The rest of this chapter addresses these points when it comes to writing JavaScript.  Minimizing Globals JavaScript uses functions to manage scope. A variable declared inside of a function is local  to  that  function  and  not  available  outside  the  function.  On  the  other  hand, global variables are those declared outside of any function or simply used without being declared. Every JavaScript environment has a global object accessible when you use this outside of  any  function.  Every  global  variable  you  create  becomes  a  property  of  the  global object. In browsers, for convenience, there is an additional property of the global object called window that  usually  points to the global object itself. The following code snippet shows how to create and access a global variable in a browser environment:  myglobal = "hello";    antipattern console.log myglobal ;    "hello" console.log window.myglobal ;    "hello" console.log window["myglobal"] ;    "hello" console.log this.myglobal ;    "hello"  10  Chapter 2: Essentials   The Problem with Globals The problem with global variables is that they are shared among all the code in your JavaScript application or web page. They live in the same global namespace and there is always a chance of naming collisions—when two separate parts of an application define global variables with the same name but with different purposes. It’s also common for web pages to include code not written by the developers of the page, for example:    A third-party JavaScript library   Scripts from an advertising partner   Code from a third-party user tracking and analytics script   Different kinds of widgets, badges, and buttons  Let’s say that one of the third-party scripts defines a global variable, called, for example, result. Then later in one of your functions you define another global variable called result. The outcome of that is the last result variable overwrites the previous ones, and the third-party script may just stop working. Therefore it’s important to be a good neighbor to the other scripts that may be in the same page and use as few global variables as possible. Later in the book you learn about strategies to minimize the number of globals, such as the namespacing pattern or the self-executing immediate functions, but the most important pattern for having fewer globals is to always use var to declare variables. It is surprisingly easy to create globals involuntarily because of two JavaScript features. First, you can use variables without even declaring them. And second, JavaScript has the notion of implied globals, meaning that any variable you don’t declare becomes a property of the global object  and is accessible just like a properly declared global var- iable . Consider the following example:  function sum x, y  {        antipattern: implied global     result = x + y;     return result; }  In this code, result is used without being declared. The code works fine, but after calling the function you end up with one more variable result in the global namespace that can be a source of problems. The rule of thumb is to always declare variables with var, as demonstrated in the im- proved version of the sum   function:  function sum x, y  {     var result = x + y;     return result; }  Minimizing Globals   11   Another antipattern that creates implied globals is to chain assignments as part of a var  declaration.  In  the  following  snippet,  a  is  local  but  b  becomes  global,  which  is probably not what you meant to do:     antipattern, do not use function foo   {     var a = b = 0;         ... }  var a =  b = 0 ;  function foo   {     var a, b;        ...     a = b = 0;    both local }  If you’re wondering why that happens, it’s because of the right-to-left evaluation. First, the expression b = 0 is evaluated and in this case b is not declared. The return value of this expression is 0, and it’s assigned to the new local variable declared with var a. In other words, it’s as if you’ve typed:  If you’ve already declared the variables, chaining assignments is fine and doesn’t create unexpected globals. Example:  Yet another reason to avoid globals is portability. If you want your code to run in different environments  hosts , it’s dangerous to use globals because you can accidentally overwrite a host object that doesn’t exist in your original environment  so you thought the name was safe to use  but which does in some of the others.  Side Effects When Forgetting var There’s one slight difference between implied globals and explicitly defined ones—the difference is in the ability to undefine these variables using the delete operator:    Globals created with var  those created in the program outside of any function     Implied globals created without var  regardless if created inside functions  can be  cannot be deleted.  deleted.  This shows that implied globals are technically not real variables, but they are properties of the global object. Properties can be deleted with the delete operator whereas varia- bles cannot:     define three globals var global_var = 1; global_novar = 2;    antipattern  function    {  12  Chapter 2: Essentials       global_fromfunc = 3;    antipattern }   ;     attempt to delete delete global_var;    false delete global_novar;    true delete global_fromfunc;    true     test the deletion typeof global_var;    "number" typeof global_novar;    "undefined" typeof global_fromfunc;    "undefined"  In ES5 strict mode, assignments to undeclared variables  such as the two antipatterns in the preceding snippet  will throw an error.  Access to the Global Object In  the  browsers,  the  global  object  is  accessible  from  any  part  of  the  code  via  the window property  unless you’ve done something special and unexpected such as de- claring a local variable named  window . But in other environments this convenience property may be called something else  or even not available to the programmer . If you need to access the global object without hard-coding the identifier window, you can do the following from any level of nested function scope:  var global =  function    {     return this; }   ;  This way you can always get the global object, because inside functions that were in- voked as functions  that is, not as constrictors with new  this should always point to the global object. This is actually no longer the case in ECMAScript 5 in strict mode, so you have to adopt a different pattern when your code is in strict mode. For example, if you’re developing a library, you can wrap your library code in an immediate function  discussed in Chapter 4  and then from the global scope, pass a reference to this as a parameter to your immediate function.  Single var Pattern Using a single var statement at the top of your functions is a useful pattern to adopt. It has the following benefits:    Provides a single place to look for all the local variables needed by the function   Prevents logical errors when a variable is used before it’s defined  see “Hoisting: A  Problem with Scattered vars” on page 14     Helps you remember to declare variables and therefore minimize globals   Is less code  to type and to transfer over the wire   Minimizing Globals   13   The single var pattern looks like this:  function func   {     var a = 1,         b = 2,         sum = a + b,         myobject = {},         i,         j;         function body...  You use one var statement and declare multiple variables delimited by commas. It’s a good practice to also initialize the variable with an initial value at the time you declare it. This can prevent logical errors  all uninitialized and declared variables are initialized with the value undefined  and also improve the code readability. When you look at the code later, you can get an idea about the intended use of a variable based on its initial value—for example, was it supposed to be an object or an integer? You can also do some actual work at the time of the declaration, like the case with sum = a + b in the preceding code. Another example is when working with DOM  Docu- ment Object Model  references. You can assign DOM references to local variables to- gether with the single declaration, as the following code demonstrates:  function updateElement   {     var el = document.getElementById "result" ,         style = el.style;         do something with el and style...  }  }  Hoisting: A Problem with Scattered vars JavaScript enables you to have multiple var statements anywhere in a function, and they all act as if the variables were declared at the top of the function. This behavior is known as hoisting. This can lead to logical errors when you use a variable and then you declare it further in the function. For JavaScript, as long as a variable is in the same scope  same function , it’s considered declared, even when it’s used before the  var declaration. Take a look at this example:     antipattern myname = "global";    global variable function func   {     alert myname ;    "undefined"     var myname = "local";     alert myname ;    "local" } func  ;  14  Chapter 2: Essentials   In this example, you might expect that the first alert   will prompt “global” and the second will prompt “local.” It’s a reasonable expectation because, at the time of the first alert, myname was not declared and therefore the function should probably “see” the global  myname. But that’s not how it works. The first alert will say “undefined” because myname is considered declared as a local variable to the function.  Although the declaration  comes  after.   All  the  variable  declarations  get  hoisted  to  the  top  of  the function. Therefore to avoid this type of confusion, it’s best to declare upfront all var- iables you intend to use. The preceding code snippet will behave as if it were implemented like so:  myname = "global";    global variable function func   {     var myname;    same as -> var myname = undefined;     alert myname ;    "undefined"     myname = "local";     alert myname ;    "local" } func  ;  For  completeness,  let’s  mention  that  actually  at  the  implementation level things are a little more complex. There are two stages of the code handling, where variables, function declarations, and formal parameters are created at the first stage, which is the stage of parsing and entering the context. In the second stage, the stage of runtime code execution, function expressions and unqualified identifiers  undeclared variables  are created. But for practical purposes, we can adopt the concept of hoisting, which is actually not defined by ECMAScript standard but is commonly used to describe the behavior.  for Loops In  for  loops  you  iterate  over  arrays  or  array-like  objects  such  as  arguments  and HTMLCollection objects. The usual for loop pattern looks like the following:     sub-optimal loop for  var i = 0; i < myarray.length; i++  {        do something with myarray[i] }  A problem with this pattern is that the length of the array is accessed on every loop iteration. This can slow down your code, especially when myarray is not an array but an HTMLCollection object. HTMLCollections are objects returned by DOM methods such as:    document.getElementsByName     document.getElementsByClassName     document.getElementsByTagName    for Loops   15   There are also a number of other HTMLCollections, which were introduced before the DOM standard and are still in use today. There include  among others :  document.images  All IMG elements on the page  document.links  All A elements  document.forms  All forms  document.forms[0].elements  All fields in the first form on the page  The trouble with collections is that they are live queries against the underlying docu- ment   the  HTML  page .  This  means  that  every  time  you  access  any  collection’s length, you’re querying the live DOM, and DOM operations are expensive in general. That’s why a better pattern for for loops is to cache the length of the array  or collection  you’re iterating over, as shown in the following example:  for  var i = 0, max = myarray.length; i < max; i++  {        do something with myarray[i] }  This way you retrieve the value of length only once and use it during the whole loop. Caching the length when iterating over HTMLCollections is faster across all browsers— anywhere between two times faster  Safari 3  and 190 times  IE7 .  For more details, see High Performance JavaScript by Nicholas Zakas [O’Reilly].  Note that when you explicitly intend to modify the collection in the loop  for example, by adding more DOM elements , you’d probably like the length to be updated and not constant. Following the single var pattern, you can also take the var out of the loop and make the loop like:  function looper   {     var i = 0,         max,         myarray = [];         ...      for  i = 0, max = myarray.length; i < max; i++  {            do something with myarray[i]     } }  This pattern has the benefit of consistency because you stick to the single var pattern. A  drawback  is  that  it  makes  it  a  little  harder  to  copy  and  paste  whole  loops  while refactoring code. For example, if you’re copying the loop from one function to another,  16  Chapter 2: Essentials   you have to make sure you also carry over i and max into the new function  and probably delete them from the original function if they are no longer needed there . One  last  tweak  to  the  loop  would  be  to  substitute  i++  with  either  one  of  these expressions: i = i + 1 i += 1  JSLint prompts you to do it; the reason being that ++ and -- promote “excessive trick- iness.” If you disagree with this, you can set the JSLint option plusplus to false.  It’s true by default.  Later in the book, the last pattern is used: i += 1. Two variations of the for pattern introduce some micro-optimizations because they:    Use one less variable  no max    Count down to 0, which is usually faster because it’s more efficient to compare to  0 than to the length of the array or to anything other than 0  The first modified pattern is:  var i, myarray = [];  for  i = myarray.length; i--;  {        do something with myarray[i] }  And the second uses a while loop:  var myarray = [],     i = myarray.length;  while  i--  {        do something with myarray[i] }  These are micro-optimizations and will only be noticed in performance-critical opera- tions. Additionally, JSLint will complain about the use of i--.  for-in Loops for-in loops should be used to iterate over nonarray objects. Looping with for-in is also called enumeration. Technically, you can also use for-in to loop over arrays  because in JavaScript arrays are objects , but it’s not recommended. It may lead to logical errors if the array object has already been augmented with custom functionality. Additionally, the order  the sequence  of listing the properties is not guaranteed in a for-in. So it’s preferable to use normal for loops with arrays and for-in loops for objects. It’s important to use the method hasOwnProperty   when iterating over object properties to filter out properties that come down the prototype chain.  for-in Loops   17   Consider the following example:     the object var man = {     hands: 2,     legs: 2,     heads: 1 };     somewhere else in the code    a method was added to all objects if  typeof  Object.prototype.clone === "undefined"  {     Object.prototype.clone = function    {}; }  In this example we have a simple object called man defined with an object literal. Some- where before or after man was defined, the Object prototype was augmented with a useful method called  clone  . The prototype chain is live, which means all objects automatically get access to the new method. To avoid having the clone   method show up when enumerating man, you need to call hasOwnProperty   to filter out the prototype properties. Failing to do the filtering can result in the function clone   showing up, which is undesired behavior in mostly all scenarios:     1.    for-in loop for  var i in man  {     if  man.hasOwnProperty i   {    filter         console.log i, ":", man[i] ;     } }  * result in the console hands : 2 legs : 2 heads : 1 *      2.    antipattern:    for-in loop without checking hasOwnProperty   for  var i in man  {     console.log i, ":", man[i] ; }  * result in the console hands : 2 legs : 2 heads : 1 clone: function   *   18  Chapter 2: Essentials   Another  pattern  for  using  hasOwnProperty    is  to  call  that  method  off  of  the Object.prototype, like so:  for  var i in man  {     if  Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call man, i   {    filter         console.log i, ":", man[i] ;     } }  The benefit is that you can avoid naming collisions is case the man object has redefined hasOwnProperty. Also to avoid the long property lookups all the way to Object, you can use a local variable to “cache” it:  var i,     hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty; for  i in man  {     if  hasOwn.call man, i   {    filter         console.log i, ":", man[i] ;     } }  Strictly speaking, not using hasOwnProperty   is not an error. Depending on the task and the confidence you have in the code, you may skip it and slightly speed up the loops. But when you’re not sure about the contents of the object  and its prototype chain , you’re safer just adding the hasOwnProperty   check.  A formatting variation  which doesn’t pass JSLint  skips a curly brace and puts the if on the same line. The benefit is that the loop statement reads more like a complete thought  “for each element that has an own property X, do something with X” . Also there’s less indentation before you get to the main purpose of the loop:     Warning: doesn't pass JSLint var i,     hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty; for  i in man  if  hasOwn.call man, i   {    filter     console.log i, ":", man[i] ; }   Not  Augmenting Built-in Prototypes Augmenting the prototype property of constructor functions is a powerful way to add functionality, but it can be too powerful sometimes. It’s  tempting  to  augment  prototypes  of  built-in  constructors  such  as  Object  , Array  , or Function  , but it can seriously hurt maintainability, because it will make your code less predictable. Other developers using your code will probably expect the built-in JavaScript methods to work consistently and will not expect your additions.   Not  Augmenting Built-in Prototypes   19   Additionally, properties you add to the prototype may show up in loops that don’t use hasOwnProperty  , so they can create confusion. Therefore it’s best if you don’t augment built-in prototypes. You can make an exception of the rule only when all these conditions are met:  1. It’s expected that future ECMAScript versions or JavaScript implementations will implement this functionality as a built-in method consistently. For example, you can add methods described in ECMAScript 5 while waiting for the browsers to catch up. In this case you’re just defining the useful methods ahead of time.  2. You check if your custom property or method doesn’t exist already—maybe al- ready implemented somewhere else in the code or already part of the JavaScript engine of one of the browsers you support.  3. You clearly document and communicate the change with the team.  If these three conditions are met, you can proceed with the custom addition to the prototype, following this pattern:  if  typeof Object.protoype.myMethod !== "function"  {     Object.protoype.myMethod = function    {            implementation...     }; }  switch Pattern You can improve the readability and robustness of your switch statements by following this pattern:  var inspect_me = 0,     result = '';  switch  inspect_me  { case 0:     result = "zero";     break; case 1:     result = "one";     break; default:     result = "unknown"; }  20  Chapter 2: Essentials  The style conventions followed in this simple example are:    Aligning each case with switch  an exception to the curly braces indentation rule .   Indenting the code within each case.   Ending each case with a clear break;.     Avoiding fall-throughs  when you omit the break intentionally . If you’re abso- lutely convinced that a fall-through is the best approach, make sure you document such cases, because they might look like errors to the readers of your code.    Ending the switch with a default: to make sure there’s always a sane result even  if none of the cases matched.  Avoiding Implied Typecasting JavaScript implicitly typecasts variables when you compare them. That’s why compar- isons such as false == 0 or "" == 0 return true. To  avoid  confusion  caused  by  the  implied  typecasting,  always  use  the  ===  and  !== operators that check both the values and the type of the expressions you compare:  var zero = 0; if  zero === false  {        not executing because zero is 0, not false }     antipattern if  zero == false  {        this block is executed... }  There’s another school of thought that subscribes to the opinion that it’s redundant to use === when == is sufficient. For example, when you use typeof you know it returns a string, so there’s no reason to use strict equality. However, JSLint requires strict equal- ity; it does make the code look consistent and reduces the mental effort when reading code.  “Is this == intentional or an omission?”   Avoiding eval   If you spot the use of eval   in your code, remember the mantra “eval   is evil.” This function takes an arbitrary string and executes it as JavaScript code. When the code in question is known beforehand  not determined at runtime , there’s no reason to use eval  . If the code is dynamically generated at runtime, there’s often a better way to achieve the goal without eval  . For example, just using square bracket notation to access dynamic properties is better and simpler:     antipattern var property = "name"; alert eval "obj." + property  ;     preferred var property = "name"; alert obj[property] ;  Using eval   also has security implications, because you might be executing code  for example coming from the network  that has been tampered with. This is a common  Avoiding Implied Typecasting  21   antipattern when dealing with a JSON response from an Ajax request. In those cases it’s better to use the browsers’ built-in methods to parse the JSON response to make sure it’s safe and valid. For browsers that don’t support JSON.parse   natively, you can use a library from JSON.org. It’s also important to remember that passing strings to setInterval  , setTimeout  , and the Function   constructor is, for the most part, similar to using eval   and there- fore should be avoided. Behind the scenes, JavaScript still has to evaluate and execute the string you pass as programming code:     antipatterns setTimeout "myFunc  ", 1000 ; setTimeout "myFunc 1, 2, 3 ", 1000 ;     preferred setTimeout myFunc, 1000 ; setTimeout function    {     myFunc 1, 2, 3 ; }, 1000 ;  Using the new Function   constructor is similar to eval   and should be approached with care. It could be a powerful construct but is often misused. If you absolutely must use eval  , you can consider using new Function   instead. There is a small potential benefit because the code evaluated in new Function   will be running in a local function scope, so any variables defined with var in the code being evaluated will not become globals  automatically.  Another  way  to  prevent  automatic  globals  is  to  wrap  the eval   call into an immediate function  more about immediate functions in Chapter 4 . Consider the following example. Here only un remains as a global variable polluting the namespace:  console.log typeof un ;       "undefined" console.log typeof deux ;     "undefined" console.log typeof trois ;    "undefined"  var jsstring = "var un = 1; console.log un ;"; eval jsstring ;    logs "1"  jsstring = "var deux = 2; console.log deux ;"; new Function jsstring   ;    logs "2"  jsstring = "var trois = 3; console.log trois ;";  function    {     eval jsstring ; }   ;    logs "3"  console.log typeof un ;       "number" console.log typeof deux ;     "undefined" console.log typeof trois ;    "undefined"  Another difference between  eval   and the  Function constructor is that  eval   can interfere with the scope chain whereas Function is much more sandboxed. No matter where you execute Function, it sees only the global scope. So it can do less local variable  22  Chapter 2: Essentials   pollution. In the following example, eval   can access and modify a variable in its outer scope,  whereas  Function  cannot   also  note  that  using  Function  or  new  Function  is  identical :   function    {     var local = 1;     eval "local = 3; console.log local " ;    logs 3     console.log local ;    logs 3 }   ;   function    {     var local = 1;     Function "console.log typeof local ;"   ;    logs undefined }   ;  Number Conversions with parseInt   Using parseInt   you can get a numeric value from a string. The function accepts a second radix parameter, which is often omitted but shouldn’t be. The problems occur when the string to parse starts with 0: for example, a part of a date entered into a form field. Strings that start with 0 are treated as octal numbers  base 8  in ECMAScript 3; however, this has changed in ES5. To avoid inconsistency and unexpected results, al- ways specify the radix parameter:  var month = "06",     year = "09"; month = parseInt month, 10 ; year = parseInt year, 10 ;  In this example, if you omit the radix parameter like parseInt year , the returned value will be 0, because “09” assumes octal number  as if you did parseInt year, 8   and 09 is not a valid digit in base 8. Alternative ways to convert a string to a number include:  +"08"    result is 8 Number "08"     8  These are often faster than parseInt  , because parseInt  , as the name suggests, parses and  doesn’t  simply  convert.  But  if  you’re  expecting  input  such  as  “08  hello”, parseInt   will return a number, whereas the others will fail with NaN.  Coding Conventions It’s important to establish and follow coding conventions—they make your code con- sistent, predictable, and much easier to read and understand. A new developer joining the team can read through the conventions and be productive much sooner, under- standing the code written by any other team member.  Coding Conventions   23   Many flamewars have been fought in meetings and on mailing lists over specific aspects of certain coding conventions  for example, the code indentation—tabs or spaces? . So if you’re the one suggesting the adoption of conventions in your organization, be pre- pared to face resistance and hear different but equally strong opinions. Remember that it’s much more important to establish and consistently follow a convention, any con- vention, than what the exact details of that convention will be.  Indentation Code without indentation is impossible to read. The only thing worse is code with inconsistent indentation, because it looks like it’s following a convention, but it may have  confusing  surprises  along  the  way.  It’s  important  to  standardize  the  use  of indentation. Some developers prefer indentation with tabs, because anyone can tweak their editor to  display  the  tabs  with  the  individually  preferred  number  of  spaces.  Some  prefer spaces—usually four. It doesn’t matter as long as everyone in the team follows the same convention. This book, for example, uses four-space indentation, which is also the default in JSLint. And what should you indent? The rule is simple—anything within curly braces. This means the bodies of functions, loops  do, while, for, for-in , ifs, switches, and object properties in the object literal notation. The following code shows some examples of using indentation:  function outer a, b  {     var c = 1,         d = 2,         inner;     if  a > b  {         inner = function    {             return {                 r: c - d             };         };     } else {         inner = function    {             return {                 r: c + d             };         };     }     return inner; }  Curly Braces Curly braces should always be used, even in cases when they are optional. Technically, if you have only one statement in an if or a for, curly braces are not required, but you  24  Chapter 2: Essentials   should  always  use  them  anyway.  It  makes  the  code  more  consistent  and  easier  to update. Imagine you have a for loop with one statement only. You could omit the braces and there will be no syntax error:     bad practice for  var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1      alert i ;  But what if, later on, you add another line in the body of the loop?     bad practice for  var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1      alert i ;     alert i + " is " +  i % 2 ? "odd" : "even"  ;  The second alert is outside the loop although the indentation may trick you. The best thing to do in the long run is to always use the braces, even for one-line blocks:     better for  var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1  {     alert i ; }  Similarly for if conditions:     bad if  true      alert 1 ; else     alert 2 ;     better if  true  {     alert 1 ; } else {     alert 2 ; }  Or:  if  true  {     alert "It's TRUE!" ; }  if  true  {     alert "It's TRUE!" ; }  Opening Brace Location Developers also tend to have preferences about where the opening curly brace should be—on the same line or on the following line?  Coding Conventions   25   In this specific example, it’s a matter of preference, but there are cases in which the program might behave differently depending on where the brace is. This is because of the semicolon insertion mechanism—JavaScript is not picky when you choose not to end your lines properly with a semicolon and adds it for you. This behavior can cause troubles when a function returns an object literal and the opening brace is on the next line:  If you expect this function to return an object with a name property, you’ll be surprised. Because of the implied semicolons, the function returns undefined. The preceding code is equivalent to this one:     warning: unexpected return value function func   {     return     {         name: "Batman"     }; }     warning: unexpected return value function func   {       return undefined;          unreachable code follows...       {           name: "Batman"       }; }  function func   {     return {         name: "Batman"     }; }  In conclusion, always use curly braces and always put the opening one on the same line as the previous statement:  A note on semicolons: Just like with the curly braces, you should always use semicolons, even when they are implied by the JavaScript parsers. This not only promotes discipline and a more rigorous approach to the code  but  also  helps  resolve  ambiguities,  as  the  previous  example showed.  White Space The use of white space can also contribute to improved readability and consistency of the code. In written English sentences you use intervals after commas and periods. In JavaScript you follow the same logic and add intervals after list-like expressions  equiv- alent to commas  and end-of-statements  equivalent to completing a “thought” .  26  Chapter 2: Essentials   Good places to use a white space include:    After the semicolons that separate the parts of a for loop: for example, for  var i    Initializing multiple variables  i and max  in a for loop: for  var i = 0, max = 10;  = 0; i < 10; i += 1  {...}  i < max; i += 1  {...}    After the commas that delimit array items: var a = [1, 2, 3];   After commas in object properties and after colons that divide property names and  their values: var o = {a: 1, b: 2};    Delimiting function arguments: myFunc a, b, c    Before the curly braces in function declarations: function myFunc   {}   After function in anonymous function expressions: var myFunc = function    {};  Another good use for white space is to separate all operators and their operands with spaces, which basically means use a space before and after +, -, *, =,  ,  =, ===, !==, &&, , +=, and so on:     generous and consistent spacing    makes the code easier to read    allowing it to "breathe" var d = 0,     a = b + 1; if  a && b && c  {     d = a % c;     a += d; }     antipattern    missing or inconsistent spaces    make the code confusing var d= 0,     a =b+1; if  a&& b&&c  { d=a %c;     a+= d; }  And a final note about white space—curly braces spacing. It’s good to use a space:    Before opening curly braces  {  in functions, if-else cases, loops, and object literals   Between the closing curly brace  }  and else or while  A case against liberal use of white space might be that it could increase the file size, but minification  discussed later in the chapter  takes care of this issue.  An  often-overlooked  aspect  of  code  readability  is  the  use  of  vertical white space. You can use blank lines to separate units of code, just as paragraphs are used in literature to separate ideas.  Coding Conventions   27   Naming Conventions Another way to make your code more predictable and maintainable is to adopt naming conventions. That means choosing names for your variables and functions in a con- sistent manner. Below are some naming convention suggestions that you can adopt as-is or tweak to your liking. Again, having a convention and following it consistently is much more important than what that convention actually is.  Capitalizing Constructors JavaScript doesn’t have classes but has constructor functions invoked with new:  var adam = new Person  ;  Because constructors are still just functions, it helps if you can tell, just by looking at a function name, whether it was supposed to behave as a constructor or as a normal function. Naming constructors with a capital first letter provides that hint. Using lowercase for functions and methods indicates that they are not supposed to be called with new:  function MyConstructor   {...} function myFunction   {...}  In the next chapter there are some patterns that enable you to programmatically force your constructors to behave like constructors, but simply following the naming con- vention is helpful in itself, at least for programmers reading the source code.  Separating Words When you have multiple words in a variable or a function name, it’s a good idea to follow a convention as to how the words will be separated. A common convention is to use the so-called camel case. Following the camel case convention, you type the words in lowercase, only capitalizing the first letter in each word. For your constructors, you can use upper camel case, as in MyConstructor  , and for function  and  method  names,  you  can  use  lower  camel  case,  as  in  myFunction  , calculateArea   and getFirstName  . And  what  about  variables  that  are  not  functions?  Developers  commonly  use  lower camel case for variable names, but another good idea is to use all lowercase words delimited  by  an  underscore:  for  example,  first_name,  favorite_bands,  and old_company_name. This notation helps you visually distinguish between functions and all other identifiers—primitives and objects.  28  Chapter 2: Essentials   ECMAScript uses camel case for both methods and properties, although the multiword property names are rare  lastIndex and ignoreCase properties of regular expression objects .  Other Naming Patterns Sometimes developers use a naming convention to make up or substitute language features. For example, there is no way to define constants in JavaScript  although there are some built-in such as Number.MAX_VALUE , so developers have adopted the convention of using all-caps for naming variables that shouldn’t change values during the life of the pro- gram, like:     precious constants, please don't touch var PI = 3.14,     MAX_WIDTH = 800;  There’s another convention that competes for the use of all caps: using capital letters for names of global variables. Naming globals with all caps can reinforce the practice of minimizing their number and can make them easily distinguishable. Another case of using a convention to mimic functionality is the private members con- vention. Although you can implement true privacy in JavaScript, sometimes developers find it easier to just use an underscore prefix to denote a private method or property. Consider the following example:  var person = {     getName: function    {         return this._getFirst   + ' ' + this._getLast  ;     },     _getFirst: function    {            ...     },     _getLast: function    {            ...     } };  In  this  example  getName    is  meant  to  be  a  public  method,  part  of  the  stable  API, whereas  _getFirst   and  _getLast   are meant to be private. They are still normal public methods, but using the underscore prefix warns the users of the person object that these methods are not guaranteed to work in the next release and shouldn’t be used directly. Note that JSLint will complain about the underscore prefixes, unless you set the option nomen: false. Following are some varieties to the _private convention:    Using a trailing underscore to mean private, as in name_ and getElements_     Using  one  underscore  prefix  for  _protected  properties  and  two  for  __private  properties  Naming Conventions   29     In Firefox some internal properties not technically part of the language are avail- able, and they are named with a two underscores prefix and a two underscore  suffix, such as __proto__ and __parent__  Writing Comments You have to comment your code, even if it’s unlikely that someone other than you will ever touch it. Often when you’re deep into a problem you think it’s obvious what the code does, but when you come back to the code after a week, you have a hard time remembering how it worked exactly. You shouldn’t go overboard commenting the obvious: every single variable or every single line. But you usually need to document all functions, their arguments and return values, and also any interesting or unusual algorithm or technique. Think of the com- ments as hints to the future readers of the code; the readers need to understand what your code does without reading much more than just the comments and the function and property names. When you have, for example, five or six lines of code performing a specific task, the reader can skip the code details if you provide a one-line description describing the purpose of the code and why it’s there. There’s no hard and fast rule or ratio of comments-to-code; some pieces of code  think regular expressions  may ac- tually require more comments than code.  The most important habit, yet hardest to follow, is to keep the com- ments up to date, because outdated comments can mislead and be much worse than no comments at all.  And  as  you’ll  see  in  the  next  section,  comments  can  help  you  auto-generate documentation.  Writing API Docs Most developers consider writing documentation a boring and unrewarding task. But that doesn’t have to be the case. API documentation can be auto-generated from com- ments in the code. This way you can have the documentation written without actually writing  it.  Most  programmers  find  this  idea  fascinating,  because  auto-generating  a readable reference from specific keywords and specially formatted “commands” looks much like actual programming. Traditionally  API  docs  come  from  the  Java  world,  where  a  utility  called  javadoc  is distributed together with the Java SDK  Software Developer Kit . But the same idea has been ported to many other languages. And for JavaScript there are two excellent tools, both free and open source: the JSDoc Toolkit  http:  code.google.com p jsdoc-toolkit   and YUIDoc  http:  yuilibrary.com projects yuidoc .  30  Chapter 2: Essentials   The process of generating API documentation includes:    Writing specially formatted code blocks   Running a tool to parse the code and the comments   Publishing the results of the tool, which are most often HTML pages  The special syntax you need to learn consists of a dozen or so tags, which look like this:   **  * @tag value  *   For example, say you have a function called reverse   that flips a string around. It takes a string parameter and at the end returns another string. Documenting it could look like this:   **  * Reverse a string  *  * @param  {String} input String to reverse  * @return {String} The reversed string  *  var reverse = function  input  {        ...     return output; };  You can see that @param is the tag for input parameters and @return is the tag used to document return values. The documentation tool parses these tags and produces a set of nicely formatted HTML documents at the end.  YUIDoc Example YUIDoc was originally created with the purpose of documenting the YUI  Yahoo! User Interface  library, but it can be used for any project. It has some conventions that you should follow to make the best use of the tool, for example, the notion of modules and classes.  Although there’s no such thing as classes in JavaScript.  Let’s see a complete example of generating documentation using YUIDoc. Figure 2-1 shows a preview of the nicely formatted documentation you’ll get at the end. You can actually tweak the HTML template to make it even nicer and more customized to your project needs, look, and feel. For a live demo of the example, visit http:  jspatterns.com book 2 . In this example, the whole application consists of one file only  app.js  with only one module  myapp  in it. You’ll learn more about modules in the following chapters, but for now, just think of the module as a comment tag you need to make YUIDoc work.  Writing API Docs   31   And then you define an object math_stuff that has two methods: sum   and multi  :  Figure 2-1. Documentation generated by YUIDoc  The contents of app.js starts like this:   **  * My JavaScript application  *  * @module myapp  *   Then you define a blank object to use as a namespace:  var MYAPP = {};   **  * A math utility  * @namespace MYAPP  * @class math_stuff  *  MYAPP.math_stuff = {       **      * Sums two numbers  32  Chapter 2: Essentials        *      * @method sum      * @param  {Number} a First number      * @param  {Number} b The second number      * @return {Number} The sum of the two inputs      *      sum: function  a, b  {         return a + b;     },       **      * Multiplies two numbers      *      * @method multi      * @param  {Number} a First number      * @param  {Number} b The second number      * @return {Number} The two inputs multiplied      *      multi: function  a, b  {         return a * b;     } };  And that completes the first “class.” Note the highlighted tags:  The global reference that contains your object.  @namespace  @class  @method  @param  @return  A misnomer  no classes in JavaScript  that is used to mean either an object or a constructor function.  Defines a method in an object and specifies the method name.  Lists the arguments that a function takes. The types of the parameters are in curly braces, followed by the parameter name and its description.  Like @param, only it describes the value returned by the method and has no name.  For the second “class,” let’s use a constructor function and add a method to its proto- type, just to get a feeling for how the documentation system works with the different ways to create objects:   **  * Constructs Person objects  * @class Person  * @constructor  * @namespace MYAPP  * @param {String} first First name  * @param {String} last Last name  *  MYAPP.Person = function  first, last  {  Writing API Docs   33        **      * Name of the person      * @property first_name      * @type String      *      this.first_name = first;      **      * Last  family  name of the person      * @property last_name      * @type String      *      this.last_name  = last;  };   **  * Returns the name of the person object  *  * @method getName  * @return {String} The name of the person  *  MYAPP.Person.prototype.getName = function    {     return this.first_name + ' ' + this.last_name; };  In Figure 2-1 you can see what the generated documentation for this Person constructor looks like. The highlighted parts here are:    @constructor hints that this “class” is actually a constructor function   @property and @type describe properties of an object  The YUIDoc system is language-agnostic and only parses the comment blocks, not the JavaScript code. The drawback is that you have to state the names of properties, pa- rameters, and methods in the comments, for example, @property first_name. The ben- efit is that when you’re comfortable with it, you can use the same system to document code in any language.  Writing to Be Read Writing the comments for the API doc blocks is not only a lazy way to provide reference documentation, but it also serves another purpose—improving code quality by making you revisit your code. Any writer or editor will tell you that editing is important: probably the most important step in producing a good book or article. Getting it down on paper is only the first step, the first draft. The draft communicates some information to the reader but probably not in the most clear, structured, or easy-to-follow manner. The same applies to writing code. When you sit down and solve a problem, that solution is merely a first draft. It produces the desired output, but does it do so in the best way? Is it easy to read, understand, maintain, and update? When you revisit your code, ideally  34  Chapter 2: Essentials   after some time has passed, you will most certainly see areas for improvement—ways to make the code easier to follow, remove some inefficiencies, and so on. That’s es- sentially editing, and it can help enormously toward your goal of creating high-quality code. But more often than not, we work under tight deadlines  “here’s the problem, the solution is due yesterday”  and there’s no time for editing. That’s why writing API docs is an editing opportunity. Often when you write doc comment blocks, you revisit the problem. Sometimes revis- iting makes it clear that, for example, this third parameter to a method is actually more often needed than the second, and the second will almost always default to true, so it makes sense to tweak the method’s interface and swap them. Writing to be read means writing code, or even just the API, with the idea that someone else will read it. This fact alone will make you edit and think of better ways to solve the problem you have at hand. Talking about first drafts, there’s also the idea of “plan to throw one away.” It may look a little extreme at first, but it makes a lot of sense, especially when you have a mission- critical project at hand  and human lives depend on it . The idea is that the first solution you come up with should be thrown away and then you start from scratch. The first solution may be a working solution, but it’s nothing more than a draft, one example way to solve a problem. The second solution will always be better, because you now have a much deeper understanding of the problem. In the second solution, you’re also not allowed to copy-paste from the first one, which helps prevent you from taking shortcuts or settling for the nonperfect solution.  Peer Reviews Another way to make your code better is to have it peer reviewed. Peer reviews could be formal and standardized, even aided by specialized tools, and this is a great way to make the reviews a streamlined part of the development process. But not having the time to research and adopt review tools shouldn’t be in the way. You can simply ask the developer next to you to take a look at your code or you can walk her through it. Again, as with writing API docs or any type of documentation, peer reviews help you write clearer code, simply because you know someone else will need to read and un- derstand what you’re doing. Peer reviews are a good practice not only because the resulting code is better, but also because both reviewer and creator share and exchange knowledge and learn from each other’s experience and individual approaches. If you’re a one-person shop and don’t have any peers to review your code, that also shouldn’t be an obstacle. You can always open-source at least a part of the code or simply blog about an interesting piece of it and this way have the world be your reviewer.  Peer Reviews   35   Another good practice is to have your source control system  CVS, Subversion, Git  send an email notification to the team any time someone checks in code. Most of these emails will be unread, but every once in a while a spontaneous peer review might hap- pen when someone decides to take a break from their work and take a look at the code you just checked in.  Minify…In Production Minification  is  the  process  of  eliminating  white  space,  comments,  and  other nonessential parts of the JavaScript code to decrease the size of the JavaScript files that need to be transferred from the server to the browser. This is usually done by a tool  a minifier  such as the Yahoo! YUICompressor or Google’s Closure Compiler and helps speed up the page loading time. It is important to minify the production-ready scripts because this results in significant savings, often cutting the size in half. Here’s what a sample of a minified code looks like  this is part of YUI2 Library’s Event utility :  YAHOO.util.CustomEvent=function D,C,B,A {this.type=D;this.scope=Cwindow;this.silent =B;this.signature=AYAHOO.util.CustomEvent.LIST;this.subscribers=[];if !this.silent  {}var E="_YUICEOnSubscribe";if D!==E {this.subscribeEvent=new YAHOO.util.CustomEvent E,this,true ;}...  In addition to stripping white space, new lines, and comments, minifiers also rename variables to shorter names  but only when it’s safe to do so , such as the parameters D, C, B, A in the preceding code. Minifiers can rename only local variables because re- naming  globals  might  break  the  code.  This  is  why  it’s  a  good  practice  to  use  local variables whenever possible. If you use a global variable, such as a DOM reference, more than once or twice in a function, it’s a good practice to assign it to a local variable. This will speed up the lookups when resolving a variable name, and so the code will be faster during runtime in addition to minifying better and being downloaded faster. As a side note, Google Closure Compiler will also attempt to minify global variables as well  in “advanced” mode , which is risky and requires some attention and discipline on your end to take advantage of that extra minification. Minifying your production code is important because it helps the page performance, but you should leave this job to the minifier. It’s a mistake to attempt to write pre- minified  code.  You  should  always  use  descriptive  variable  names,  consistent  white space  and  indentation,  comments,  and  so  on.  The  code  you  write  will  be  read   by humans , so make it easy for the maintainer to understand it quickly and let the minifier  the machine  take care of reducing the file sizes.  36  Chapter 2: Essentials   Run JSLint JSLint was already introduced in the previous chapter and is also mentioned on nu- merous occasions in this chapter. At this point you’re probably convinced that it’s a good programming pattern to run JSLint on your code. What does JSLint look for? It looks for violations of some of the patterns discussed in this chapter  single var pattern, radix for parseInt  , always using curly braces  and many other violations including:    Unreachable code   Using variables before they are defined   Unsafe UTF characters   Using void, with, or eval   Improperly escaped characters in regular expressions  JSLint is written is JavaScript  and would most probably pass a JSLint check ; the good news is that it’s available as a web-based tool and as downloadable code for many platforms and JavaScript interpreters. You can download it and run it locally on any platform using WSH  Windows Scripting Host, part of all Windows systems , JSC  JavaScriptCore, part of Mac OSX , or Rhino  JavaScript interpreter by Mozilla . It’s a great idea to download JSLint and integrate it with your text editor so that you adopt the habit of running it every time you save a file.  Making a keyboard shortcut for it can also help.   Summary In this chapter we looked at what it means to write maintainable code—a topic that is important not only for the success of a software project but also to the sanity and well- being of the developers and those around them. Then we talked about some of the essential best practices and patterns including:    Reducing the number of globals, ideally to one per application   Using a single var per function, which helps keep an eye on all variables in a single  spot and prevents surprises caused by the variable hoisting behavior    for  loops,  for-in  loops,  switches,  “eval    is  evil,”  not  augmenting  built-in  prototypes    Following coding conventions  consistent white space, indentation, using curly braces and semicolons even when they are optional  and naming conventions  for constructors, functions, and variables   Summary  37   The chapter also discussed some additional practices, not related to the code, but to the programming process in general—writing comments, creating generated API doc- umentation,  conducting  peer  reviews,  not  attempting  to  write  minified  code  at  the expense of readability, and always checking your code with JSLint.  38  Chapter 2: Essentials   CHAPTER 3 Literals and Constructors  Literal notation patterns available in JavaScript enable more concise, more expressive, and less error-prone object definitions. This chapter discusses literals such as object, array, and regular expression literals and why they are preferable to using equivalent built-in constructor functions, such as Object   and Array  . The JSON format is in- troduced to demonstrate how array and object literals are used to define a data transfer format. The chapter also discusses custom constructors and ways to enforce new to make sure constructors behave as intended. To extend the main message of the chapter  which is to avoid constructors and use literals  instead ,  there’s  a  discussion  of  the  built-in  wrapper  constructors  Number  , String  , and Boolean   and how they compare to the primitive number, string, and boolean  values.  Finally  there’s  a  quick  note  on  the  use  of  the  different  built-in Error   constructors.  Object Literal When you think about objects in JavaScript, simply think about hash tables of key- value pairs  similar to what are called “associative arrays” in other languages . The values can be primitives or other objects; in both cases they are called properties. The values can also be functions, in which case they are called methods. The custom objects you create in JavaScript  in other words, the user-defined native objects  are mutable at any time. Many of the properties of the built-in native objects are also mutable. You can start with a blank object and add functionality to it as you go. The object literal notation is ideal for this type of on-demand object creation. Consider the following example:    start with an empty object var dog = {};     add one property dog.name = "Benji";  39      now add a method dog.getName = function    {     return dog.name; };  In the preceding example, you begin with a clean slate—a blank object. Then you add a property and a method to it. At any time in the life of the program you can:    Change the values of properties and methods, for example:  dog.getName = function    {        redefine the method to return        a hardcoded value     return "Fido"; };    Remove properties methods completely:  delete dog.name;    Add more properties and methods:  dog.say = function    {     return "Woof!"; }; dog.fleas = true;  You are not required to start with an empty object. The object literal pattern enables you  to  add  functionality  to  the  object  at  the  time  of  creation,  as  the  next  example demonstrates. var dog = {     name: "Benji",     getName: function    {         return this.name;     } };  You'll see “blank object” and “empty object” in a few places throughout this book. It’s important to understand that this is for simplicity and there’s no such thing as an empty object in JavaScript. Even the simplest {}  object  already  has  properties  and  methods  inherited  from Object.prototype. By “empty” we’ll understand an object that has no own properties other than the inherited ones.  The Object Literal Syntax If you’re not used to the object literal notation, it may look a little odd at the beginning, but the more you use it, the more you’ll love it. In essence, the syntax rules are:    Wrap the object in curly braces  { and } .   Comma-delimit the properties and methods inside the object. A trailing comma after the last name-value pair is allowed but produces errors in IE, so don’t use it.  40  Chapter 3: Literals and Constructors     Separate property names and property values with a colon.   When  you  assign  the  object  to  a  variable,  don’t  forget  the  semicolon  after  the  closing }.  Objects from a Constructor There are no classes in JavaScript and this allows for great flexibility, because you don’t have to know anything about your object in advance; you don’t need a class “blueprint.” But JavaScript also has constructor functions, which use syntax similar to the class- based object creation in Java or other languages. You can create objects using your own constructor functions or using some of the built- in constructors such as Object  , Date  , String   and so on. Here’s an example showing two equivalent ways to create two identical objects:     one way -- using a literal var car = {goes: "far"};     another way -- using a built-in constructor    warning: this is an antipattern var car = new Object  ; car.goes = "far";  As you can see from this example, an obvious benefit of the literal notation is that it’s shorter to type. Another reason why the literal is the preferred pattern for object crea- tion is that it emphasizes that objects are simply mutable hashes and not something that needs to be baked from a “recipe”  from a class . Another reason for using literals as opposed to the Object constructor is that there is no scope resolution. Because it’s possible that you have created a local constructor with the same name, the interpreter needs to look up the scope chain from the place you are calling Object   all the way up until it finds the global Object constructor.  Object Constructor Catch You have no reason to use the new Object   constructor when you can use an object literal, but you might be inheriting legacy code written by others, so you should be aware of one “feature” of this constructor  or yet another reason not to use it . The feature in question is that the Object   constructor accepts a parameter and, depending on the value passed, it may decide to delegate the object creation to another built-in constructor and return a different object than you expect. Following are a few examples of passing a number, a string, and a boolean value to new Object  ; the result is that you get objects created with a different constructor:     Warning: antipatterns ahead     an empty object var o = new Object  ;  Object Literal   41   console.log o.constructor === Object ;    true     a number object var o = new Object 1 ; console.log o.constructor === Number ;    true console.log o.toFixed 2  ;    "1.00"     a string object var o = new Object "I am a string" ; console.log o.constructor === String ;    true    normal objects don't have a substring      method but string objects do console.log typeof o.substring ;    "function"     a boolean object var o = new Object true ; console.log o.constructor === Boolean ;    true  This behavior of the Object   constructor can lead to unexpected results when the value you pass to it is dynamic and not known until runtime. Again, in conclusion, don’t use new Object  ; use the simpler and reliable object literal instead.  Custom Constructor Functions In addition to the object literal pattern and the built-in constructor functions, you can create objects using your own custom constructor functions, as the following example demonstrates:  var adam = new Person "Adam" ; adam.say  ;    "I am Adam"  This new pattern looks very much like creating an object in Java using a class called Person.  The  syntax  is  similar,  but  actually  in  JavaScript  there  are  no  classes  and Person is just a function. Here’s how the Person constructor function could be defined.  var Person = function  name  {     this.name = name;     this.say = function    {         return "I am " + this.name;     }; };  When you invoke the constructor function with new, the following happens inside the function:    An empty object is created and referenced by this variable, inheriting the prototype  of the function.    Properties and methods are added to the object referenced by this.   The newly created object referenced by this is returned at the end implicitly  if no  other object was returned explicitly .  42  Chapter 3: Literals and Constructors   It’s as if something like this happens behind the scenes:  var Person = function  name  {         create a new object        using the object literal        var this = {};         add properties and methods     this.name = name;     this.say = function    {         return "I am " + this.name;     };         return this; };  For simplicity in this example, the say   method was added to this. The result is that any time you call new Person   a new function is created in memory. This is obviously inefficient, because the say   method doesn’t change from one instance to the next. The better option is to add the method to the prototype of Person:  Person.prototype.say = function    {     return "I am " + this.name; };  We’ll talk more about prototypes and inheritance in the chapters to come, but just remember that reusable members, such as methods, should go to the prototype. There is one more thing that will become clear later in the book, but it is worth men- tioning here for the sake of completeness. We said that inside of the constructor some- thing like this happens behind the scenes:     var this = {};  That’s not the whole truth, because the “empty” object is not actually empty; it has inherited from the Person’s prototype. So it’s more like:     var this = Object.create Person.prototype ;  We’ll discuss what Object.create   means later in the book.  Constructor’s Return Values When invoked with new, a constructor function always returns an object; by default it’s the object referred to by this. If you don’t add any properties to this inside of your constructor, an “empty” object is returned  “empty” aside from inheriting from the constructor’s prototype . Constructors implicitly return this, even when you don’t have a return statement in the function. But you can return any other object of your choosing. In the next example, a new object referenced by that is created and returned.  Custom Constructor Functions   43   var Objectmaker = function    {         this `name` property will be ignored        because the constructor        decides to return another object instead     this.name = "This is it";         creating and returning a new object     var that = {};     that.name = "And that's that";     return that; };     test var o = new Objectmaker  ; console.log o.name ;    "And that's that"  As can you see, you have the freedom to return any object in your constructors, as long as it’s an object. Attempting to return something that’s not an object  like a string or a boolean false, for example  will not cause an error but will simply be ignored, and the object referenced by this will be returned instead.  Patterns for Enforcing new As mentioned already, constructors are still just functions but invoked with new. What happens if you forget new when you invoke a constructor? This is not going to cause syntax or runtime errors but might lead to logical errors and unexpected behavior. That’s because when you forget new, this inside the constructor will point to the global object.  In browsers this will point to window.  When your constructor has something like this.member and you invoke the constructor without  new,  you’re  actually  creating  a  new  property  of  the  global  object  called member and accessible through window.member or simply member. This behavior is highly undesirable, because you know you should always strive for keeping the global name- space clean.     constructor function Waffle   {     this.tastes = "yummy"; }     a new object var good_morning = new Waffle  ; console.log typeof good_morning ;    "object" console.log good_morning.tastes ;    "yummy"     antipattern:    forgotten `new` var good_morning = Waffle  ; console.log typeof good_morning ;    "undefined" console.log window.tastes ;    "yummy"  44  Chapter 3: Literals and Constructors   This undesired behavior is addressed in ECMAScript 5, and in strict mode this will no longer point to the global object. If ES5 is not available, there’s still something you can do to make sure that a constructor function always behaves like one even if called without new.  Naming Convention The simplest alternative is to use a naming convention, as discussed in the previous chapter, where you uppercase the first letter in constructor names  MyConstructor  and lowercase it in “normal” functions and methods  myFunction .  Using that Following a naming convention can certainly help, but it merely suggests and doesn’t enforce the correct behavior. Here’s a pattern that helps you make sure your constructor always behaves as a constructor. Instead of adding all members to this, you add them to that and then return that.  For simpler objects, you don’t even need a local variable such as that; you can simply return an object from a literal like so:  function Waffle   {     var that = {};     that.tastes = "yummy";     return that; }  function Waffle   {     return {         tastes: "yummy"     }; }  Using any of the implementations above Waffle   always returns an object, regardless of how it’s called:  var first = new Waffle  ,     second = Waffle  ; console.log first.tastes ;    "yummy" console.log second.tastes ;    "yummy"  The problem with this pattern is that the link to the prototype is lost, so any members you add to the Waffle   prototype will not be available to the objects.  Note that the variable name that is just a convention; it’s not a part of the  language.  You  can  use  any  name,  where  other  common  variable names include self and me.  Patterns for Enforcing new  45   Self-Invoking Constructor To address the drawback of the previous pattern and have prototype properties avail- able to the instance objects, consider the following approach. In the constructor you check whether this is an instance of your constructor, and if not, the constructor in- vokes itself again, this time properly with new:  function Waffle   {      if  ! this instanceof Waffle   {         return new Waffle  ;     }      this.tastes = "yummy";  } Waffle.prototype.wantAnother = true;     testing invocations var first = new Waffle  ,     second = Waffle  ;  console.log first.tastes ;    "yummy" console.log second.tastes ;    "yummy"  console.log first.wantAnother ;    true console.log second.wantAnother ;    true  Another  general-purpose  way  to  check  the  arguments.callee instead of hard-coding the constructor name.  instance   is  to  compare  with  if  ! this instanceof arguments.callee   {     return new arguments.callee  ; }  This pattern uses the fact that inside every function, an object called arguments is created containing all parameters passed to the function when it was invoked. And arguments has a property called callee, which points back to the function that was called. Be aware that arguments.callee is not allowed in ES5’s strict mode, so it’s best if you limit its future use and also remove any instances should you find them in existing code.  Array Literal Arrays in JavaScript, as most other things in the language, are objects. They can be created with the built-in constructor function Array  , but they also have a literal no- tation and, just like the object literal, the array literal notation is simpler and preferred. Here’s how you can create two arrays with the same elements in two different ways— using the Array   constructor and using the literal pattern.  46  Chapter 3: Literals and Constructors      array of three elements    warning: antipattern var a = new Array "itsy", "bitsy", "spider" ;     the exact same array var a = ["itsy", "bitsy", "spider"];  console.log typeof a ;    "object", because arrays are objects console.log a.constructor === Array ;    true  Array Literal Syntax There’s not much to the array literal notation: it’s just a comma-delimited list of ele- ments and the whole list is wrapped in square brackets. You can assign any type of value to the array elements, including objects or other arrays. The array literal syntax is simple, straightforward, and elegant. After all, an array is just a zero-indexed list of values. There’s no need to complicate things  and write more code  by including a constructor and using the new operator.  Array Constructor Curiousness One more reason to stay away from new Array   is to avoid a possible trap that this constructor has in store for you. When you pass a single number to the Array   constructor, it doesn’t become the value of the first array element. It sets the length of the array instead. This means that new Array 3  creates an array with length of 3, but no actual elements. If you try to access any of the elements, you get the value undefined because the elements don’t exist. The following code example shows the different behavior when you use the literal and the constructor with a single value.     an array of one element var a = [3]; console.log a.length ;    1 console.log a[0] ;    3     an array of three elements var a = new Array 3 ; console.log a.length ;    3 console.log typeof a[0] ;    "undefined"     using array literal var a = [3.14]; console.log a[0] ;    3.14  Although this behavior might be a little unexpected, it gets worse when you pass a floating point number to new Array   as opposed to an integer. This results in an error because the floating point is not a valid value for the array’s length:  Array Literal   47   var a = new Array 3.14 ;    RangeError: invalid array length console.log typeof a ;    "undefined"  To avoid potential errors when creating dynamic arrays at runtime, it’s much safer to stick with the array literal notation.  There are some clever uses of the Array   constructor though, for ex- ample, for repeating strings. The following snippet returns a string with 255 white spaces  why not 256, I’ll leave the curious reader to think about :  var white = new Array 256 .join ' ' ;  Check for Array-ness Using the typeof operator with array operands returns “object.”  console.log typeof [1, 2] ;    "object"  Although this behavior makes sense  arrays are objects , it’s not too helpful. Often you need to know if a value actually is an array. Sometimes you can see code checking for the presence of length property or some array method such as slice   to determine “array-ness.” But these checks are not robust because there’s no reason why a nonarray object shouldn’t have properties and methods with the same names. Also people some- times use instanceof Array, but this check works incorrectly when used across frames in some IE versions. ECMAScript 5 defines a new method Array.isArray  , which returns true if the argu- ment is an array. For example:  Array.isArray [] ;    true     trying to fool the check    with an array-like object Array.isArray {     length: 1,     "0": 1,     slice: function    {} } ;    false  If this new method is not available in your environment, you can make the check by  calling the Object.prototype.toString   method. If you invoke the call   method of toString in the context of an array, it should return the string “[object Array]”. If the context is an object, it should return the string “[object Object]”. So you can do some- thing like this:  if  typeof Array.isArray === "undefined"  {     Array.isArray = function  arg  {         return Object.prototype.toString.call arg  === "[object Array]";     }; }  48  Chapter 3: Literals and Constructors   JSON Now that you’re familiar with the array and object literals previously discussed, let’s take a look at JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a data transfer format. It’s lightweight and convenient to work with in many languages, especially in JavaScript. There’s actually nothing new to learn about JSON. It’s only a combination of the array and the object literal notation. Here’s an example of a JSON string:  {"name": "value", "some": [1, 2, 3]}  The only syntax difference between JSON and the object literal is that property names need to be wrapped in quotes to be valid JSON. In object literals the quotes are required only when the property names are not valid identifiers, for example, they have spaces {"first name": "Dave"}. In JSON strings you cannot use functions or regular expression literals.  Working with JSON As mentioned in the previous chapter, it’s not recommended to blindly evaluate any JSON string with eval   because of the security implications. It’s best if you use the JSON.parse   method, which is part of the language since ES5 and is natively provided by the JavaScript engines in modern browsers. For older JavaScript engines, you can use the JSON.org library  http:  www.json.org json2.js  to gain access to the JSON object and its methods.     an input JSON string var jstr = '{"mykey": "my value"}';     antipattern var data = eval ' ' + jstr + ' ' ;     preferred var data = JSON.parse jstr ;  console.log data.mykey ;    "my value"     an input JSON string var jstr = '{"mykey": "my value"}';     parse the string and turn it into an object    using a YUI instance YUI  .use 'json-parse', function  Y  {     var data = Y.JSON.parse jstr ;     console.log data.mykey ;    "my value" } ;  If you already use a JavaScript library, chances are that it comes with a utility to parse JSON, so you may not need the additional JSON.org library. For example, using YUI3, you can do:  JSON  49   The opposite of JSON.parse   method is JSON.stringify  . It takes any object or array  or a primitive  and serializes it into a JSON string.  In jQuery, there’s the parseJSON   method:     an input JSON string var jstr = '{"mykey": "my value"}';  var data = jQuery.parseJSON jstr ; console.log data.mykey ;    "my value"  var dog = {     name: "Fido",     dob:  new Date  ,     legs: [1, 2, 3, 4] };  var jsonstr = JSON.stringify dog ;     jsonstr is now:    {"name":"Fido","dob":"2010-04-11T22:36:22.436Z","legs":[1,2,3,4]}  Regular Expression Literal Regular expressions in JavaScript are also objects, and you have two options to create them:  The following sample code demonstrates two ways to create a regular expression that matches a backslash:    Using the new RegExp   constructor   Using the regular expression literal     regular expression literal var re =  \\ gm;     constructor var re = new RegExp "\\\\", "gm" ;  As you can see, the regular expression literal notation is shorter and doesn’t force you to think in terms of class-like constructors. Therefore it’s preferable to use the literal. Additionally, when using the RegExp   constructor, you also need to escape quotes and often you need to double-escape backslashes, as shown in the preceding snippet, where we need four backslashes to match a single one. This makes your regular expression patterns longer and harder to read and modify. Regular expressions are hard enough to begin with, and any chance to simplify them is welcome, so it’s best to stick to the literal notation.  50  Chapter 3: Literals and Constructors   Regular Expression Literal Syntax The regular expression literal notation uses forward slashes to wrap the regular ex- pression pattern used for matching. Following the second slash, you can put the pattern modifiers in the form of unquoted letters:    g—Global matching   m—Multiline   i—Case-insensitive matching  The pattern modifiers can appear in any order or combination:  var re =  pattern gmi;  Using the regular expression literal helps write more concise code when calling methods such  as  String.prototype.replace    that  accept  regular  expression  objects  as parameters.  var no_letters = "abc123XYZ".replace  [a-z] gi, "" ; console.log no_letters ;    123  One reason to use new RegExp   is that the pattern is not known in advance but is created as a string at runtime. Another distinction between the regular expression literal and the constructor is that the literal creates an object only once during parse time. If you create the same regular expression in a loop, the previously created object will be returned with all its properties  such as lastIndex  already set from the first time. Consider the following example as an illustration of how the same object is returned twice.  function getRE   {     var re =  [a-z] ;     re.foo = "bar";     return re; }  var reg = getRE  ,     re2 = getRE  ;  console.log reg === re2 ;    true reg.foo = "baz"; console.log re2.foo ;    "baz"  This behavior has changed in ES5 and the literal also creates new ob- jects. The behavior has also been corrected in many browser environ- ments, so it’s not to be relied on.  And one last note that calling RegExp   without new  as a function, not as a constructor  behaves the same as with new.  Regular Expression Literal   51   Primitive Wrappers JavaScript  has  five  primitive  value  types:  number,  string,  boolean,  null,  and undefined.  With  the  exception  of  null  and  undefined,  the  other  three  have  the  so- called primitive wrapper objects. The wrapper objects can be created using the built-in  constructors Number  , String  , and Boolean  . To illustrate the difference between a primitive number and a number object, consider the following example:    a primitive number var n = 100; console.log typeof n ;    "number"     a Number object var nobj = new Number 100 ; console.log typeof nobj ;    "object"  The wrapper objects have some useful properties and methods—for example, number objects  have  methods  such  as  toFixed    and  toExponential  .  String  objects  have substring  , charAt  , and toLowerCase   methods  among others  and a length prop- erty. These methods are convenient and can be a good reason to decide to create an object, as opposed to using a primitive. But the methods work on primitives, too—as soon as you invoke a method, the primitive is temporarily converted to an object behind the scenes and behaves as if it were an object.    a primitive string be used as an object var s = "hello"; console.log s.toUpperCase   ;    "HELLO"  Because primitives can act as objects as soon as you need them to, often there’s no reason to use the more verbose wrapper constructors. For example, you don’t have to write new String "hi" ; when you can simply use "hi":     the value itself can act as an object "monkey".slice 3, 6 ;     "key"     same for numbers  22   7 .toPrecision 3 ;    "3.14"     avoid these: var s = new String "my string" ; var n = new Number 101 ; var b = new Boolean true ;     better and simpler: var s = "my string"; var n = 101; var b = true;  One reason to use the wrapper objects is when you want to augment the value and persist  state.  Because  primitives  are  not  objects,  they  cannot  be  augmented  with properties.  52  Chapter 3: Literals and Constructors      primitive string var greet = "Hello there";     primitive is converted to an object    in order to use the split   method greet.split ' ' [0];    "Hello"     attemting to augment a primitive is not an error greet.smile = true;     but it doesn't actually work typeof greet.smile;    "undefined"  In the preceding snippet, greet was only temporarily converted to an object to make the property method access work without errors. On the other hand, if  greet were defined as an object using new String  , then the augmented smile property would’ve worked as expected. Augmenting a string, number, or boolean value is rarely used, and unless this is what you need, you probably don’t need the wrapper constructors. When used without new, wrapper constructors convert the argument passed to them to a primitive value:  typeof Number 1 ;    "number" typeof Number "1" ;    "number" typeof Number new Number   ;    "number" typeof String 1 ;    "string" typeof Boolean 1 ;    "boolean"  Error Objects JavaScript has a number of built-in error constructors, such as Error  , SyntaxError  , TypeError  , and others, which are used with the throw statement. The error objects created by these constructors have the following properties:  name  message  The name property of the constructor function that created the object; it could be the general “Error” or a more specialized constructor such as “RangeError”  The string passed to the constructor when creating the object  The error objects have other properties, such as the line number and filename where the error happened, but these extra properties are browser extensions inconsistently implemented across browsers and are therefore unreliable. On the other hand, throw works with any object, not necessarily an object created with one of the error constructors, so you can opt in for throwing your own objects. Such error objects can have the properties “name,” “message,” and any other type of infor- mation you want to pass to be handled by the catch statement. You can be creative when it comes to your custom error objects and use them to restore the application state back to normal.  Error Objects   53   try {        something bad happened, throw an error     throw {         name: "MyErrorType",    custom error type         message: "oops",         extra: "This was rather embarrassing",         remedy: genericErrorHandler    who should handle it     }; } catch  e  {        inform the user     alert e.message ;    "oops"         gracefully handle the error     e.remedy  ;    calls genericErrorHandler   }  The error constructors invoked as functions  without new  behave the same as con- structors  with new  and return the same error objects.

They perform a variety of tasks for which other languages may have special syntax. In this chapter you will learn about the different ways to define a function in JavaScript, you will learn about function expressions and function declarations, and you will see how the local scope and the variable hoisting works. Then you will learn about a num- ber of patterns that help your APIs  providing better interfaces to your functions , code initializations   with  fewer  globals ,  and  performance   in  other  words—work avoidance . Let’s dive into functions, starting by first reviewing and clarifying the important basics.  Background There are two main features of the functions in JavaScript that make them special— the first is that functions are first-class objects and the second is that they provide scope. Functions are objects that:    Can be created dynamically at runtime, during the execution of the program   Can be assigned to variables, can have their references copied to other variables,  can be augmented, and, except for a few special cases, can be deleted    Can be passed as arguments to other functions and can also be returned by other  functions    Can have their own properties and methods  So it could happen that a function A, being an object, has properties and methods, one of which happens to be another function B. Then B can accept a function C as an argument and, when executed, can return another function D. At first sight, that’s a lot of functions to keep track of. But when you’re comfortable with the various appli- cations of the functions, you get to appreciate the power, flexibility, and expressiveness  57   that functions can offer. In general, when you think of a function in JavaScript, think of an object, with the only special feature that this object is invokable, meaning it can be executed. The fact that functions are objects becomes obvious when you see the new Function   constructor in action:     antipattern    for demo purposes only var add = new Function 'a, b', 'return a + b' ; add 1, 2 ;    returns 3  In this code, there’s no doubt that add   is an object; after all it was created by a con- structor. Using the Function   constructor is not a good idea though  it’s as bad as eval    because code is passed around as a string and evaluated. It’s also inconvenient to write  and read  because you have to escape quotes and take extra care if you want to properly indent the code inside the function for readability. The second important feature is that functions provide scope. In JavaScript there’s no curly braces local scope; in other words, blocks don’t create scope. There’s only func- tion scope. Any variable defined with var inside of a function is a local variable, invisible outside the function. Saying that curly braces don’t provide local scope means that if you define a variable with var inside of an if condition or inside of a for or a while loop, that doesn’t mean the variable is local to that if or for. It’s only local to the wrapping function, and if there’s no wrapping function, it becomes a global variable. As discussed in Chapter 2, minimizing the number of globals is a good habit, so func- tions are indispensable when it comes to keeping the variable scope under control.  Disambiguation of Terminology Let’s take a moment to discuss the terminology surrounding the code used to define a function, because using accurate and agreed-upon names is just as important as the code when talking about patterns. Consider the following snippet:    named function expression var add = function add a, b  {     return a + b; };  The preceding code shows a function, which uses a named function expression. If you skip the name  the second add in the example  in the function expression, you get an unnamed function expression, also known as simply as function expression or most commonly as an anonymous function. An example is:     function expression, a.k.a. anonymous function var add = function  a, b  {     return a + b; };  58  Chapter 4: Functions   So the broader term is “function expression” and the “named function expression” is a specific case of a function expression, which happens to define the optional name. When you omit the second add and end up with an unnamed function expression, this won’t affect the definition and the consecutive invocations of the function. The only difference is that the name property of the function object will be a blank string. The name property is an extension of the language  it’s not part of the ECMA standard  but widely available in many environments. If you keep the second add, then the property add.name will contain the string “add.” The name property is useful when using debug- gers, such as Firebug, or when calling the same function recursively from itself; other- wise you can just skip it. Finally, you have function declarations. They look the most similar to functions used in other languages: function foo   {        function body goes here }  In terms of syntax, named function expressions and function declarations look similar, especially if you don’t assign the result of the function expression to a variable  as we’ll see in the callback pattern further in the chapter . Sometimes there’s no other way to tell the difference between a function declaration and a named function expression other than looking at the context in which the function occurs, as you’ll see in the next section. There’s syntax difference between the two in the trailing semicolon. The semicolon is not needed in function declarations but is required in function expressions, and you should always use it even though the automatic semicolon insertion mechanism might do it for you.  The term function literal is also commonly used. It may mean either a function expression or a named function expression. Because of this ambiguity, it’s probably better if we don’t use it.  Declarations Versus Expressions: Names and Hoisting So what should you use—function declarations or function expressions? In cases in which syntactically you cannot use a declaration, this dilemma is solved for you. Ex- amples include passing a function object as a parameter or defining methods in object literals:     this is a function expression,    pased as an argument to the function `callMe` callMe function    {        I am an unnamed function expression        also known as an anonymous function } ;  Background  59      this is a named function expression callMe function me   {        I am a named function expression        and my name is "me" } ;     another function expression var myobject = {     say: function    {            I am a function expression     } };     global scope function foo   {}  function local   {        local scope     function bar   {}     return bar; }  Function declarations can only appear in “program code,” meaning inside of the bodies of other functions or in the global space. Their definitions cannot be assigned to vari- ables or properties, or appear in function invocations as parameters. Here’s an example of the allowed usage of function declarations, where all the functions foo  , bar  , and local   are defined using the function declaration pattern:  Function’s name Property Another thing to consider when choosing a function definition pattern is the availability of the read-only name property. Again, this property is not standard but available in many  environments.  In  function  declarations  and  named  function  expressions,  the name property is defined. In anonymous function expressions, it depends on the im- plementation;  it  could  be  undefined   IE   or  defined  with  an  empty  string   Firefox, WebKit :  function foo   {}    declaration var bar = function    {};    expression var baz = function baz   {};    named expression  foo.name;    "foo" bar.name;    "" baz.name;    "baz"  The name property is useful when debugging code in Firebug or other debuggers. When the debugger needs to show you an error in a function, it can check for the presence of the name property and use it as an indicator. The name property is also used to call the same function recursively from within itself. If you were not interested in these two cases, then an unnamed function expression would be easier and less verbose.  60  Chapter 4: Functions   The case against function declarations and the reason to prefer function expressions is that the expressions highlight that functions are objects like all other objects and not some special language construct.  It’s technically possible to use a named function expression and assign it to a variable with a different name, for example:  var foo = function bar   {};  However,  the  behavior  of  this  usage  is  not  properly  implemented  in some browsers  IE , so it’s not recommended to use this pattern.  Function Hoisting From the previous discussion you may conclude that the behavior of function decla- rations is pretty much equivalent to a named function expression. That’s not exactly true, and a difference lies in the hoisting behavior.  The term hoisting is not defined in ECMAScript, but it’s common and a good way to describe the behavior.  As you know, all variables, no matter where in the function body they are declared, get hoisted to the top of the function behind the scenes. The same applies for functions because they are just objects assigned to variables. The only “gotcha” is that when using a function declaration, the definition of the function also gets hoisted, not only its declaration. Consider this snippet:     antipattern    for illustration only     global functions function foo   {     alert 'global foo' ; } function bar   {     alert 'global bar' ; }  function hoistMe   {      console.log typeof foo ;    "function"     console.log typeof bar ;    "undefined"      foo  ;    "local foo"     bar  ;    TypeError: bar is not a function         function declaration:        variable 'foo' and its implementation both get hoisted  Background  61       function foo   {         alert 'local foo' ;     }         function expression:        only variable 'bar' gets hoisted        not the implementation     var bar = function    {         alert 'local bar' ;     };  } hoistMe  ;  In this example you see that, just like with normal variables, the mere presence of foo and bar anywhere in the hoistMe   function moves them to the top, overwriting the global foo and bar. The difference is that local foo  ’s definition is hoisted to the top and works fine; although it’s defined later. The definition of bar   is not hoisted, only its  declaration.  That’s  why  until  the  code  execution  reaches  bar  ’s  definition,  it’s undefined and not usable as a function  while still preventing the global bar   from being “seen” in the scope chain . Now that the required background and terminology surrounding functions is out of the way, let’s see some of the good patterns related to functions that JavaScript has to offer, starting with the callback pattern. Again, it’s important to remember the two special features of the functions in JavaScript:    They are objects.   They provide local scope.  Callback Pattern Functions are objects, which means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions. When you pass the function introduceBugs   as a parameter to the function writeCode  ,  then  at  some  point  writeCode    is  likely  to  execute   or  call  introduceBugs  . In this case introduceBugs   is called a callback function or simply a callback:  function writeCode callback  {        do something...     callback  ;        ... }  function introduceBugs   {        ... make bugs }  writeCode introduceBugs ;  62  Chapter 4: Functions   Note how introduceBugs   is passed as an argument to writeCode   without the pa- rentheses. Parentheses execute a function whereas in this case we want to pass only a reference to the function and let writeCode   execute it  in other words, call it back  when appropriate.  A Callback Example Let’s take an example and start without a callback first and then refactor later. Imagine you have a general-purpose function that does some complicated work and returns a large  data  set  as  a  result.  This  generic  function  could  be  called,  for  example, findNodes  , and its task would be to crawl the DOM tree of a page and return an array of page elements that are interesting to you:  var findNodes = function    {     var i = 100000,    big, heavy loop         nodes = [],    stores the result         found;    the next node found     while  i  {         i -= 1;            complex logic here...         nodes.push found ;     }     return nodes; };  var hide = function  nodes  {     var i = 0, max = nodes.length;     for  ; i < max; i += 1  {         nodes[i].style.display = "none";     } };     executing the functions hide findNodes   ;  It’s a good idea to keep this function generic and have it simply return an array of DOM nodes, without doing anything with the actual elements. The logic of modifying nodes could be in a different function, for example a function called hide   which, as the name suggests, hides the nodes from the page:  This implementation is inefficient, because hide   has to loop again through the array of nodes returned by findNodes  . It would be more efficient if you could avoid this loop and hide the nodes as soon as you select them in findNodes  . But if you implement the hiding logic in findNodes  , it will no longer be a generic function because of the coupling of the retrieval and modification logic. Enter the callback pattern—you pass your node hiding logic as a callback function and delegate its execution:     refactored findNodes   to accept a callback var findNodes = function  callback  {     var i = 100000,         nodes = [],         found;  Callback Pattern  63          check if callback is callable     if  typeof callback !== "function"  {         callback = false;     }      while  i  {         i -= 1;             complex logic here...             now callback:         if  callback  {             callback found ;         }          nodes.push found ;     }     return nodes; };     a callback function var hide = function  node  {     node.style.display = "none"; };     find the nodes and hide them as you go findNodes hide ;     passing an anonymous callback findNodes function  node  {     node.style.display = "block"; } ;  The implementation is straightforward; the only additional task that findNodes   per- forms is checking if an optional callback has been provided, and if so, executing it. The callback is optional, so the refactored findNodes   can still be used as before and won’t break the old code that relies on the old API. The hide   implementation will be much simpler now because it doesn’t need to loop through nodes:  The callback can be an existing function as shown in the preceding code, or it can be an anonymous function, which you create as you call the main function. For example, here’s how you can show nodes using the same generic findNodes   function:  Callbacks and Scope In the previous examples, the part where the callback is executed was like so:  callback parameters ;  Although this is simple and will be good enough in many cases, there are often scenarios where the callback is not a one-off anonymous function or a global function, but it’s a  64  Chapter 4: Functions   method of an object. If the callback method uses this to refer to the object it belongs to, this can cause unexpected behavior. Imagine the callback is the function paint  , which is a method of the object called myapp:  var myapp = {}; myapp.color = "green"; myapp.paint = function  node  {     node.style.color = this.color; };  The function findNodes   does something like this:  var findNodes = function  callback  {        ...     if  typeof callback === "function"  {         callback found ;     }        ... };  If you call findNodes myapp.paint , it won’t work as expected, because this.color will not be defined. The object this will refer to the global object, because findNodes   is a global  function.  If  findNodes    were  a  method  of  an  object  called  dom   like dom.findNodes   , then this inside of the callback would refer to dom instead of the expected myapp. The solution to this problem is to pass the callback function and in addition pass the object this callback belongs to:  findNodes myapp.paint, myapp ;  Then you also need to modify findNodes   to bind that object you pass:  var findNodes = function  callback, callback_obj  {       ...     if  typeof callback === "function"  {         callback.call callback_obj, found ;     }       ... };  There will be more on the topics of binding and using call   and apply   in future chapters. Another option for passing an object and a method to be used as a callback is to pass the method as a string, so you don’t repeat the object twice. In other words:  findNodes myapp.paint, myapp ;  can become:  findNodes "paint", myapp ;  Then findNodes   would do something along these lines:  Callback Pattern  65   var findNodes = function  callback, callback_obj  {      if  typeof callback === "string"  {         callback = callback_obj[callback];     }        ...     if  typeof callback === "function"  {         callback.call callback_obj, found ;     }       ... };  Asynchronous Event Listeners The callback pattern has many everyday uses; for example, when you attach an event listener to an element on a page, you’re actually providing a pointer to a callback func- tion  that  will  be  called  when  the  event  occurs.  Here’s  a  simple  example  of  how console.log   is passed as a callback when listening to the document’s click event:  document.addEventListener "click", console.log, false ;  Most of the client-side browser programming is event-driven. When the page is done loading, it fires a load event. Then the user interacts with the page and causes various events to fire, such as click, keypress, mouseover, mousemove, and so on. JavaScript is especially suited for event-driven programming, because of the callback pattern, which enables your programs to work asynchronously, in other words, out of order. “Don’t call us, we’ll call you” is a famous phrase in Hollywood, where many candidates audition for the same role in a movie. It would be impossible for the casting crew to answer phone calls from all the candidates all the time. In the asynchronous event- driven JavaScript, there is a similar phenomenon. Only instead of giving your phone number, you provide a callback function to be called when the time is right. You may even provide more callbacks than needed, because certain events may never happen. For example, if the user never clicks “Buy now!” then your function that validates the credit card number format will never be called back.  Timeouts Another example of the callback pattern in the wild is when you use the timeout meth- ods provided by the browser’s window object: setTimeout   and setInterval  . These methods also accept and execute callbacks:  var thePlotThickens = function    {     console.log '500ms later...' ; }; setTimeout thePlotThickens, 500 ;  66  Chapter 4: Functions  Note again how the function thePlotThickens is passed as a variable, without paren- theses, because you don’t want it executed right away, but simply want to point to it   for later use by setTimeout  . Passing the string "thePlotThickens  " instead of a func- tion pointer is a common antipattern similar to eval  .  Callbacks in Libraries The callback is a simple and powerful pattern, which can come in handy when you’re designing a library. The code that goes into a software library should be as generic and reusable as possible, and the callbacks can help with this generalization. You don’t need to predict and implement every feature you can think of, because it will bloat the library, and most of the users will never need a big chunk of those features. Instead, you focus on core functionality and provide “hooks” in the form of callbacks, which will allow the library methods to be easily built upon, extended, and customized.  Returning Functions Functions are objects, so they can be used as return values. This means that a function doesn’t need to return some sort of data value or array of data as a result of its execution. A function can return another more specialized function, or it can create another func- tion on-demand, depending on some inputs. Here’s a simple example: A function does some work, probably some one-off initiali- zation, and then works on its return value. The returned value happens to be another function, which can also be executed:  var setup = function    {     alert 1 ;     return function    {         alert 2 ;     }; };     using the setup function var my = setup  ;    alerts 1 my  ;    alerts 2  Because setup   wraps the returned function, it creates a closure, and you can use this closure to store some private data, which is accessible by the returned function but not to the outside code. An example would be a counter that gives you an incremented value every time you call it: var setup = function    {     var count = 0;     return function    {         return  count += 1 ;     }; };     usage var next = setup  ; next  ;    returns 1  Returning Functions   67   next  ;    2 next  ;    3  Self-Defining Functions Functions can be defined dynamically and can be assigned to variables. If you create a new function and assign it to the same variable that already holds another function, you’re overwriting the old function with the new one. In a way, you’re recycling the old function pointer to point to a new function. And all this can happen inside the body of the old function. In this case the function overwrites and redefines itself with a new implementation. This probably sounds more complicated than it is; let’s take a look at a simple example:  var scareMe = function    {     alert "Boo!" ;     scareMe = function    {         alert "Double boo!" ;     }; };     using the self-defining function scareMe  ;    Boo! scareMe  ;    Double boo!  This pattern is useful when your function has some initial preparatory work to do and it needs to do it only once. Because there’s no reason to do repeating work when it can be avoided, a portion of the function may no longer be required. In such cases, the self- defining function can update its own implementation. Using this pattern can obviously help with the performance of your application, because your redefined function simply does less work.  Another name for this pattern is “lazy function definition,” because the function is not properly defined until the first time it’s used and it is being lazy afterwards, doing less work.  A drawback of the pattern is that any properties you’ve previously added to the original function will be lost when it redefines itself. Also if the function is used with a different name, for example, assigned to a different variable or used as a method of an object, then the redefinition part will never happen and the original function body will be executed. Let’s see an example where the scareMe   function is used in a way that a first-class object would be used:  1. A new property is added. 2. The function object is assigned to a new variable.  68  Chapter 4: Functions   3. The function is also used as a method.  Consider the following snippet:     1. adding a new property scareMe.property = "properly";     2. assigning to a different name var prank = scareMe;     3. using as a method var spooky = {     boo: scareMe };     calling with a new name prank  ;    "Boo!" prank  ;    "Boo!" console.log prank.property ;    "properly"     calling as a method spooky.boo  ;    "Boo!" spooky.boo  ;    "Boo!" console.log spooky.boo.property ;     "properly"     using the self-defined function scareMe  ;    Double boo! scareMe  ;    Double boo! console.log scareMe.property ;    undefined  As you can see, the self-definition didn’t happen as you probably expected when the function was assigned to a new variable. Every time prank   was called, it alerted “Boo!” At the same time it overwrote the global scareMe   function, but prank   itself kept seeing the old definition including the property property. The same happened when the function was used as the boo   method of the spooky object. All these invocations kept rewriting the global scareMe   pointer so that when it was eventually called, it had the updated body alerting “Double boo” right from the first time. It was also no longer able to see scareMe.property.  Immediate Functions The immediate function pattern is a syntax that enables you to execute a function as soon as it is defined. Here’s an example:   function    {     alert 'watch out!' ; }   ;  This pattern is in essence just a function expression  either named or anonymous , which is executed right after its creation. The term immediate function is not defined in the ECMAScript standard, but it’s short and helps describe and discuss the pattern.  Immediate Functions   69   The pattern consists of the following parts:    You define a function using a function expression.  A function declaration won’t    You add a set of parentheses at the end, which causes the function to be executed    You wrap the whole function in parentheses  required only if you don’t assign the  The following alternative syntax is also common  note the placement of the closing parentheses , but JSLint prefers the first one:  work.   immediately.  function to a variable .   function    {     alert 'watch out!' ; }   ;  This pattern is useful because it provides a scope sandbox for your initialization code. Think about the following common scenario: Your code has to perform some setup tasks when the page loads, such as attaching event handlers, creating objects, and so on. All this work needs to be done only once, so there’s no reason to create a reusable named function. But the code also requires some temporary variables, which you won’t need after the initialization phase is complete. It would be a bad idea to create all those variables as globals. That’s why you need an immediate function—to wrap all your code in its local scope and not leak any variables in the global scope:   function    {      var days = ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat'],         today = new Date  ,         msg = 'Today is ' + days[today.getDay  ] + ', ' + today.getDate  ;      alert msg ;  }   ;    "Today is Fri, 13"  If  this  code  weren’t  wrapped  in  an  immediate  function,  then  the  variables  days, today, and msg would all be global variables, leftovers from the initialization code.  Parameters of an Immediate Function You  can  also  pass  arguments  to  immediate  functions,  as  the  following  example demonstrates:    prints:    I met Joe Black on Fri Aug 13 2010 23:26:59 GMT-0800  PST    function  who, when  {      console.log "I met " + who + " on " + when ;  } "Joe Black", new Date    ;  70  Chapter 4: Functions   Commonly, the global object is passed as an argument to the immediate function so that it’s accessible inside of the function without having to use window: this way makes the code more interoperable in environments outside the browser:   function  global  {         access the global object via `global`  } this  ;  Note that in general you shouldn’t pass too many parameters to an immediate function, because it could quickly become a burden to constantly scroll to the top and to the bottom of the function to understand how it works.  Returned Values from Immediate Functions Just like any other function, an immediate function can return values and these return values can be assigned to variables:  var result =  function    {     return 2 + 2; }   ;  var result = function    {     return 2 + 2; }  ;  var result =  function    {     return 2 + 2; }   ;  Another way to achieve the same is to omit the parentheses that wrap the function, because they are not required when you assign the return value of an immediate func- tion to a variable. Omitting the first set of parentheses gives you the following:  This syntax is simpler, but it may look a bit misleading. Failing to notice the    at the end of the function, someone reading the code might think that  result points to a function. Actually result points to the value returned by the immediate function, in this case the number 4. Yet another syntax that accomplishes the same results is:  The previous examples returned a primitive integer value as the result of executing the immediate function. But instead of a primitive value, an immediate function can return any type of value, including another function. You can then use the scope of the im- mediate function to privately store some data, specific to the inner function you return. In the next example, the value returned by the immediate function is a function, which will be assigned to the variable getResult and will simply return the value of res, a value that was precomputed and stored in the immediate function’s closure:  var getResult =  function    {     var res = 2 + 2;  Immediate Functions   71       return function    {         return res;     }; }   ;  Immediate functions can also be used when you define object properties. Imagine you need to define a property that will likely never change during the life of the object, but before you define it a bit of work needs to be performed to figure out the right value. You can use an immediate function to wrap that work and the returned value of the immediate function will become the value of the property. The following code shows an example: var o = {     message:  function    {         var who = "me",             what = "call";         return what + " " + who;     }   ,     getMsg: function    {         return this.message;     } };    usage o.getMsg  ;    "call me" o.message;     "call me"  In this example, o.message is a string property, not a function, but it needs a function, which executes while the script is loading and which helps define the property.  Benefits and Usage The immediate function pattern is widely used. It helps you wrap an amount of work you want to do without leaving any global variables behind. All the variables you define will be local to the self-invoking functions and you don’t have to worry about polluting the global space with temporary variables.  Other names for the immediate function pattern include “self-invoking” or “self-executing” function, because the function executes itself as soon as it’s defined.  This pattern is also often used in bookmarklets, because bookmarklets run on any page and keeping the global namespace clean  and your bookmarklet code unobtrusive  is critical. The pattern also enables you to wrap individual features into self-contained modules. Imagine your page is static and works fine without any JavaScript. Then, in the spirit of progressive enhancement, you add a piece of code that enhances the page somehow. You can wrap this code  you can also call it a “module” or a “feature”  into an immediate  72  Chapter 4: Functions   function and make sure the page works fine with and without it. Then you can add more enhancements, remove them, split-test them, allow the user to disable them, and so on. You can use the following template to define a piece of functionality; let’s call it module1:     module1 defined in module1.js  function    {       all the module 1 code ...  }   ;  Following the same template, you can code your other modules. Then when it’s time for releasing the code to the live site, you decide which features are ready for prime time and merge the corresponding files using your build script.  Immediate Object Initialization Another way to protect from global scope pollution, similar to the immediate functions pattern previously described, is the following immediate object initialization pattern. This pattern uses an object with an init   method, which is executed immediately after the object is created. The init   function takes care of all initialization tasks. Here’s an example of the immediate object pattern:   {        here you can define setting values        a.k.a. configuration constants     maxwidth: 600,     maxheight: 400,         you can also define utility methods     gimmeMax: function    {         return this.maxwidth + "x" + this.maxheight;     },         initialize     init: function    {         console.log this.gimmeMax   ;            more init tasks...     } } .init  ;  In terms of syntax, you approach this pattern as if you’re creating a normal object using the object literal. You also wrap the literal in parentheses  grouping operator , which instructs the JavaScript engine to treat the curly braces as object literal, not as a code block.  It’s not an if or a for loop.  After you close the parentheses, you invoke the init   method immediately.  Immediate Object Initialization  73   You can also wrap the object and the  init   invocation into grouping parentheses instead of wrapping the object only. In other words, both of these work:   {...} .init  ;  {...}.init   ;  The benefits of this pattern are the same as the immediate function pattern: you protect the global namespace while performing the one-off initialization tasks. It may look a little more involved in terms of syntax compared to just wrapping a bunch of code in an anonymous function, but if your initialization tasks are more complicated  as they often are  it adds structure to the whole initialization procedure. For example, private helper functions are clearly distinguishable because they are properties of the temporary object, whereas in an immediate function pattern, they are likely to be just functions scattered around. A drawback of this pattern is that most JavaScript minifiers may not minify this pattern as efficiently as the code simply wrapped into a function. The private properties and methods will not be renamed to shorter names because, from a minifier’s point of view, it’s not trivial to do so safely. At the moment of writing, Google’s Closure Compiler in “advanced” mode is the only minifier that renames the immediate object’s properties to shorter names, turning the preceding example into something like:   {d:600,c:400,a:function  {return this.d+"x"+this.c},b:function  {console.log this. a   }} .b  ;  This pattern is mainly suitable for one-off tasks, and there’s no access to the object after the init   has completed. If you want to keep a ref- erence to the object after it is done, you can easily achieve this by adding return this; at the end of init  .  Init-Time Branching Init-time branching  also called load-time branching  is an optimization pattern. When you know that a certain condition will not change throughout the life of the program, it makes sense to test the condition only once. Browser sniffing  or feature detection  is a typical example. For example, after you’ve sniffed that XMLHttpRequest is supported as a native object, there’s no chance that the underlying browser will change in the middle of your program execution and all of a sudden you’ll need to deal with ActiveX objects. Because the environment  doesn’t  change,  there’s  no  reason  for  your  code  to  keep  sniffing   and reaching the same conclusion  every time you need another XHR object. Figuring out the computed styles of a DOM element or attaching event handlers are other candidates that can benefit from the init-time branching pattern. Most developers have coded—at least once in their client-side programming life—a utility with methods for attaching and removing event listeners, like in the following example:  74  Chapter 4: Functions      BEFORE var utils = {     addListener: function  el, type, fn  {         if  typeof window.addEventListener === 'function'  {             el.addEventListener type, fn, false ;         } else if  typeof document.attachEvent === 'function'  {    IE             el.attachEvent 'on' + type, fn ;         } else {    older browsers             el['on' + type] = fn;         }     },     removeListener: function  el, type, fn  {            pretty much the same...     } };  The  problem  with  this  code  is  that  it’s  a  bit  inefficient.  Every  time  you  call utils.addListener   or utils.removeListener  , the same checks get executed over and over again. Using init-time branching, you sniff the browser features once, during the initial loading of the script. At that time you redefine how the function will work throughout the lifespan of the page. The following is an example of how you can approach this task:     AFTER     the interface var utils = {     addListener: null,     removeListener: null };     the implementation if  typeof window.addEventListener === 'function'  {     utils.addListener = function  el, type, fn  {         el.addEventListener type, fn, false ;     };     utils.removeListener = function  el, type, fn  {         el.removeEventListener type, fn, false ;     }; } else if  typeof document.attachEvent === 'function'  {    IE     utils.addListener = function  el, type, fn  {         el.attachEvent 'on' + type, fn ;     };     utils.removeListener = function  el, type, fn  {         el.detachEvent 'on' + type, fn ;     }; } else {    older browsers     utils.addListener = function  el, type, fn  {         el['on' + type] = fn;     };     utils.removeListener = function  el, type, fn  {         el['on' + type] = null;     }; }  Init-Time Branching  75   Here is the moment to mention a word of caution against browser sniffing. When you use this pattern, don’t over-assume browser features. For example, if you’ve sniffed that  the  browser  doesn’t  support  window.addEventListener,  don’t  just  assume  the browser you’re dealing with is IE and it doesn’t support XMLHttpRequest natively either, although it was true at some point in the browser’s history. There might be cases in which  you  can  safely  assume  that  features  go  together,  such  as  .addEventListener and .removeEventListener, but in general browser features change independently. The best strategy is to sniff features separately and then use load-time branching to do the sniffing only once.  Function Properties—A Memoization Pattern Functions are objects, so they can have properties. In fact, they do have properties and methods out-of-the-box. For example, every function, no matter what syntax you use to create it, automatically gets a length property containing the number of arguments the function expects:  function func a, b, c  {} console.log func.length ;    3  You can add custom properties to your functions at any time. One use case for custom properties is to cache the results  the return value  of a function, so the next time the function is called, it doesn’t have to redo potentially heavy computations. Caching the results of a function is also known as memoization. In the following example, the function myFunc creates a property cache, accessible as usual via myFunc.cache. The cache property is an object  a hash  where the parameter param passed to the function is used as a key and the result of the computation is the value. The result can be any complicated data structure you might need:  var myFunc = function  param  {     if  !myFunc.cache[param]  {         var result = {};            ... expensive operation ...         myFunc.cache[param] = result;     }     return myFunc.cache[param]; };     cache storage myFunc.cache = {};  The preceding code assumes that the function takes only one argument param and it’s a primitive data type  such as a string . If you have more parameters and more complex ones, a generic solution would be to serialize them. For example, you can serialize the arguments object as a JSON string and use that string as a key in your cache object:  var myFunc = function    {      var cachekey = JSON.stringify Array.prototype.slice.call arguments  ,  76  Chapter 4: Functions   Be  aware  that  in  serialization,  the  “identify”  of  the  objects  is  lost.  If  you  have  two different objects that happen to have the same properties, both will share the same cache entry. Another way to write the previous function is to use arguments.callee to refer to the function instead of hardcoding the function name. Although this is currently possible, be aware that arguments.callee is not allowed in ECMAScript 5 strict mode:          result;      if  !myFunc.cache[cachekey]  {         result = {};            ... expensive operation ...         myFunc.cache[cachekey] = result;     }     return myFunc.cache[cachekey]; };     cache storage myFunc.cache = {};  var myFunc = function  param  {      var f = arguments.callee,         result;      if  !f.cache[param]  {         result = {};            ... expensive operation ...         f.cache[param] = result;     }     return f.cache[param]; };     cache storage myFunc.cache = {};  Configuration Objects The configuration object pattern is a way to provide cleaner APIs, especially if you’re building a library or any other code that will be consumed by other programs. It’s a fact of life that software requirements change as the software is developed and maintained. It often happens that you start working with some requirements in mind, but more functionality gets added afterward. Imagine you’re writing a function called addPerson  , which accepts a first and last name and adds a person to a list:  function addPerson first, last  {...}  Configuration Objects   77   Later you learn that actually the date of birth needs to be stored, too, and optionally the gender and the address. So you modify the function adding the new parameters  carefully putting the optional parameters at the end of the list :  function addPerson first, last, dob, gender, address  {...}  At this point the signature of this function is already getting a little longer. And then you learn you need to add a username and it’s absolutely required, not optional. Now the caller of the function will have to pass even the optional parameters and be careful not to mix the order of the parameters:  addPerson "Bruce", "Wayne", new Date  , null, null, "batman" ;  Passing a large number of parameters is not convenient. A better approach is to sub- stitute all the parameters with only one and make it an object; let’s call it conf, for “configuration”:  addPerson conf ;  Then the user of the function can do:  var conf = {     username: "batman",     first: "Bruce",     last: "Wayne" }; addPerson conf ;  The pros of the configuration objects are:    No need to remember the parameters and their order   You can safely skip optional parameters   Easier to read and maintain   Easier to add and remove parameters  The cons of the configuration objects are:    You need to remember the names of the parameters   Property names cannot be minified  This pattern could be useful when your function creates DOM elements, for example, or in setting the CSS styles of an element, because elements and styles can have a great number of mostly optional attributes and properties.  78  Chapter 4: Functions   Curry The rest of the chapter discusses the topic of currying and partial function application. But before we dive into this topic, let’s first see what exactly function application means.  Function Application In some purely functional programming languages, a function is not described as being called or invoked, but rather it’s applied. In JavaScript we have the same thing—we can apply a function using the method Function.prototype.apply  , because functions in JavaScript are actually objects and they have methods. Here’s an example of a function application:     define a function var sayHi = function  who  {     return "Hello" +  who ? ", " + who : ""  + "!"; };     invoke a function sayHi  ;    "Hello" sayHi 'world' ;    "Hello, world!"     apply a function sayHi.apply null, ["hello"] ;    "Hello, hello!"  As you can see in the example, both invoking a function and applying it have the same result. apply   takes two parameters: the first one is an object to bind to this inside of the function, the second is an array or arguments, which then becomes the array-like arguments object available inside the function. If the first parameter is null, then this points to the global object, which is exactly what happens when you call a function that is not a method of a specific object. When a function is a method of an object, there’s no null reference passed around  as in the previous example . Here the object becomes the first argument to apply  :  var alien = {     sayHi: function  who  {         return "Hello" +  who ? ", " + who : ""  + "!";     } };  alien.sayHi 'world' ;    "Hello, world!" sayHi.apply alien, ["humans"] ;    "Hello, humans!"  In the preceding snippet, this inside of sayHi   points to alien. In the previous example this points to the global object. As the two examples demonstrate, it turns out that what we think of calling a function is not much more than syntactic sugar, equivalent to a function application.  Curry  79   Note that in addition to apply  , there’s a call   method of the Function.prototype object, but it’s still just syntax sugar on top of apply  . Sometimes it’s better to use the sugar: When you have a function that takes only one parameter, you can save the work of creating arrays with just one element:     the second is more efficient, saves an array sayHi.apply alien, ["humans"] ;    "Hello, humans!" sayHi.call alien, "humans" ;    "Hello, humans!"  Partial Application Now that we know that calling a function is actually applying a set of arguments to a function, is it possible to pass just a few of the arguments, not all of them? This is actually similar to how you would normally do it, if you were dealing with a math function manually. Say you have a function add   that adds two numbers together: x and y. The following snippet shows how you can approach a solution given that x is 5 and y is 4:     for illustration purposes    not valid JavaScript     we have this function function add x, y  {     return x + y; }     and we know the arguments add 5, 4 ;     step 1 -- substitute one argument function add 5, y  {     return 5 + y; }     step 2 -- substitute the other argument function add 5, 4  {     return 5 + 4; }  In this snippet the steps 1 and 2 are not valid JavaScript, but this is how you would solve that problem by hand. You take the value of the first argument and substitute the unknown x with the known value 5 throughout the function. Then repeat with the same until you run out of arguments. Step 1 in this example could be called partial application: we only applied the first argument. When you perform a partial application you don’t get a result  a solution , but you get another function instead. The next snippet demonstrates the use of an imaginary partialApply   method:  var add = function  x, y  {     return x + y;  80  Chapter 4: Functions   };     full application add.apply null, [5, 4] ;    9     partial application var newadd = add.partialApply null, [5] ;    applying an argument to the new function newadd.apply null, [4] ;    9  As you can see, the partial application gives us another function, which can then be called with the other arguments. This would actually be equivalent to something like add 5  4 , because add 5  returns a function that can then be called with  4 . Again, the familiar add 5, 4  may be thought of as not much more than syntactic sugar instead of using add 5  4 . Now, back to Earth: there’s no partialApply   method and functions in JavaScript don’t behave like this by default. But you can make them, because JavaScript is dynamic enough to allow this. The process of making a function understand and handle partial application is called  currying.  Currying Currying has nothing to do with the spicy Indian dish; it comes from the name of the mathematician Haskell Curry.  The Haskell programming language is also named after him.  Currying is a transformation process—we transform a function. An alternative name for currying could be schönfinkelisation, after the name of another mathemati- cian, Moses Schönfinkel, the original inventor of this transformation. So how do we schönfinkelify  or schönfinkelize or curry  a function? Other functional languages may have that built right into the language itself and all functions are curried by default. In JavaScript we can modify the add   function into a curried one that will handle partial application. Let’s take an example:    a curried add      accepts partial list of arguments function add x, y  {     var oldx = x, oldy = y;     if  typeof oldy === "undefined"  {    partial         return function  newy  {             return oldx + newy;         };     }        full application     return x + y; }     test  Curry  81   typeof add 5 ;    "function" add 3  4 ;    7     create and store a new function var add2000 = add 2000 ; add2000 10 ;    2010  In this snippet, the first time you call add  , it creates a closure around the inner function it returns. The closure stores the original values x and y into private variables oldx and oldy. The first one, oldx, is used when the inner function executes. If there’s no partial application and both x and y are passed, the function proceeds to simply add them. This implementation of add   is a little more verbose than needed, just for illustration purposes.  A  more  compact  version  is  shown  in  the  next  snippet,  where  there’s  no oldx and oldy, simply because the original x is stored in the closure implicitly and we reuse y as a local variable instead of creating a new variable newy as we did in the previous example:     a curried add    accepts partial list of arguments function add x, y  {     if  typeof y === "undefined"  {    partial         return function  y  {             return x + y;         };     }        full application     return x + y; }  In these examples, the function add   itself took care of partial applications. But can we do the same in a more generic fashion? In other words, can we transform any func- tion into a new one that accepts partial parameters? The next snippet shows an example of a general-purpose function, let’s call it schonfinkelize  , which does just that. We use the name  schonfinkelize   partially because it’s a challenge to pronounce and partially because it sounds like a verb  using “curry” could be ambiguous  and we need a verb to denote that this is a transformation of a function. Here is the general-purpose currying function:  function schonfinkelize fn  {     var slice = Array.prototype.slice,         stored_args = slice.call arguments, 1 ;     return function    {         var new_args = slice.call arguments ,             args = stored_args.concat new_args ;         return fn.apply null, args ;     }; }  The schonfinkelize   function is probably a little more complicated than it should be, but only because arguments is not a real array in JavaScript. Borrowing the slice   method from Array.prototype helps us turn arguments into an array and work more  82  Chapter 4: Functions   conveniently with it. When schonfinkelize   is called the first time, it stores a private reference to the slice   method  called slice  and also stores the arguments it was called with  into stored_args , only stripping the first, because the first argument is the function being curried. Then schonfinkelize   returns a new function. When the new function is called, it has access  via the closure  to the already privately stored arguments stored_args and the slice reference. The new function has to merge only the old par- tially applied arguments  stored_args  with the new ones  new_args  and then apply them to the original function fn  also privately available in the closure . Now armed with a general-purpose way of making any function curried, let’s give it a try with a few tests:  The transformation function schonfinkelize   is not limited to single parameters or to single-step currying. Here are some more usage examples:     a normal function function add x, y  {     return x + y; }     curry a function to get a new function var newadd = schonfinkelize add, 5 ; newadd 4 ;    9     another option -- call the new function directly schonfinkelize add, 6  7 ;    13     a normal function function add a, b, c, d, e  {     return a + b + c + d + e; }     works with any number of arguments schonfinkelize add, 1, 2, 3  5, 5 ;    16     two-step currying var addOne = schonfinkelize add, 1 ; addOne 10, 10, 10, 10 ;    41 var addSix = schonfinkelize addOne, 2, 3 ; addSix 5, 5 ;    16  When to Use Currying When you find yourself calling the same function and passing mostly the same param- eters, then the function is probably a good candidate for currying. You can create a new function dynamically by partially applying a set of arguments to your function. The new function will keep the repeated parameters stored  so you don’t have to pass them every  time   and  will  use  them  to  pre-fill  the  full  list  of  arguments  that  the  original function expects.  Curry  83   Summary In JavaScript the knowledge and proper use of functions is critical. This chapter dis- cussed the background and terminology related to functions. You learned about the two important features of functions in JavaScript, namely:  1. Functions are first-class objects; they can be passed around as values and augmen-  ted with properties and methods.  2. Functions provide local scope, which other curly braces do not. Also something to keep in mind is that declarations of local variables get hoisted to the top of the local scope.  The syntax for creating functions includes:  1. Named function expressions 2. Function expressions  the same as the above, but missing a name , also known as  anonymous functions  3. Function declarations, similar to the function syntax in other languages  After covering the background and syntax of functions, you learned about a number of useful patterns, which can be grouped into the following categories:  1. API patterns, which help you provide better and cleaner interfaces to your func-  tions. These patterns include: Callback patterns  Pass a function as an argument  Configuration objects  Help keep the number of arguments to a function under control  Returning functions  Currying  When the return value of one function is another function  When new functions are created based on existing ones plus a partial list of arguments  2. Initialization patterns, which help you perform initialization and setup tasks  very common when it comes to web pages and applications  in a clearer, structured way without polluting the global namespace with temporary variables. These include: Immediate functions  Executed as soon as they are defined  Immediate object initialization  Initialization tasks structured in an anonymous object that provides a method to be called immediately  84  Chapter 4: Functions   Init-time branching  Helps branch code only once during initial code execution, as opposed to many times later during the life of the application  3. Performance patterns, which help speed up the code. These include:  Memoization  Self-defining functions  Using function properties so that computed values are not computed again  Overwrite themselves with new bodies to do less work from the second invo- cation and after  Summary  85    CHAPTER 5 Object Creation Patterns  Creating objects in JavaScript is easy—you either use the object literal or you use con- structor functions. In this chapter we go beyond that and see some additional patterns for object creation. The JavaScript language is simple and straightforward and often there’s no special syn- tax for features you may be used to in other languages, such as namespaces, modules, packages, private properties, and static members. This chapter takes you through com- mon patterns to implement, substitute, or just think differently about those features. We take a look at namespacing, dependency declaration, module pattern, and sandbox patterns—they help you organize and structure your application code and mitigate the effect of the implied globals. Other topics of discussion include private and privileged members, static and private static members, object constants, chaining, and one class- inspired way to define constructors.  Namespace Pattern Namespaces help reduce the number of globals required by our programs and at the same time also help avoid naming collisions or excessive name prefixing. JavaScript doesn’t have namespaces built into the language syntax, but this is a feature that is quite easy to achieve. Instead of polluting the global scope with a lot of functions, objects, and other variables, you can create one  and ideally only one  global object for your application or library. Then you can add all the functionality to that object. Consider the following example:     BEFORE: 5 globals    Warning: antipattern     constructors function Parent   {} function Child   {}     a variable  87   You can refactor this type of code by creating a single global object for your application, called,  for  example,  MYAPP,  and  change  all  your  functions  and  variables  to  become properties of your global object:  var some_var = 1;     some objects var module1 = {}; module1.data = {a: 1, b: 2}; var module2 = {};     AFTER: 1 global     global object var MYAPP = {};     constructors MYAPP.Parent = function    {}; MYAPP.Child = function    {};     a variable MYAPP.some_var = 1;     an object container MYAPP.modules = {};     nested objects MYAPP.modules.module1 = {}; MYAPP.modules.module1.data = {a: 1, b: 2}; MYAPP.modules.module2 = {};  For the name of the global namespace object, you can pick, for example, the name of your application or library, your domain name, or your company name. Often devel- opers use the convention of making the global variable ALL CAPS, so it stands out to the readers of the code.  But keep in mind that all caps are also often used for constants.  This pattern is a good way to namespace your code and to avoid naming collisions in your own code, and collisions between your code and third-party code on the same page, such as JavaScript libraries or widgets. This pattern is highly recommended and perfectly applicable for many tasks, but it does have some drawbacks:    A bit more to type; prefixing every variable and function does add up in the total  amount of code that needs to be downloaded    Only one global instance means that any part of the code can modify the global  instance and the rest of the functionality gets the updated state    Long nested names mean longer  slower  property resolution lookups  The sandbox pattern discussed later in the chapter addresses these drawbacks.  88  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns   General Purpose Namespace Function As the complexity of a program grows and some parts of code get split into different files and included conditionally, it becomes unsafe to just assume that your code is the first to define a certain namespace or a property inside of it. Some of the properties you’re adding to the namespace may already exist, and you could be overwriting them. Therefore before adding a property or creating a namespace, it’s best to check first that it doesn’t already exist, as shown in this example:     unsafe var MYAPP = {};    better if  typeof MYAPP === "undefined"  {     var MYAPP = {}; }    or shorter var MYAPP = MYAPP  {};  You can see how these added checks can quickly result in a lot of repeating code. For example,  if  you  want  to  define  MYAPP.modules.module2,  you’ll  have  to  make  three checks, one for each object or property you’re defining. That’s why it’s handy to have a reusable function that takes care of the namespacing details. Let’s call this function namespace   and use it like so:     using a namespace function MYAPP.namespace 'MYAPP.modules.module2' ;  Next is an example implementation of the namespacing function. This implementation is nondestructive, meaning that if a namespace exists, it won’t be re-created:     equivalent to:    var MYAPP = {        modules: {            module2: {}        }    };  var MYAPP = MYAPP  {};  MYAPP.namespace = function  ns_string  {     var parts = ns_string.split '.' ,         parent = MYAPP,         i;         strip redundant leading global     if  parts[0] === "MYAPP"  {         parts = parts.slice 1 ;     }      for  i = 0; i < parts.length; i += 1  {            create a property if it doesn't exist         if  typeof parent[parts[i]] === "undefined"  {             parent[parts[i]] = {};         }  Namespace Pattern  89           parent = parent[parts[i]];     }     return parent; };  This implementation enables all of these uses:     assign returned value to a local var var module2 = MYAPP.namespace 'MYAPP.modules.module2' ; module2 === MYAPP.modules.module2;    true     skip initial `MYAPP` MYAPP.namespace 'modules.module51' ;     long namespace MYAPP.namespace 'once.upon.a.time.there.was.this.long.nested.property' ;  Figure 5-1 shows how the namespaces in the preceding example look like when in- spected in Firebug.  Figure 5-1. MYAPP namespace inspected in Firebug  Declaring Dependencies JavaScript libraries are often modular and namespaced, which enables you to include only the modules you require. For example, in YUI2 there’s a global variable YAHOO, which serves as a namespace, and then modules that are properties of the global vari- able,  such  as  YAHOO.util.Dom   the  DOM  module   and  YAHOO.util.Event   Events module . It’s a good idea to declare the modules your code relies on at the top of your function or module. The declaration involves creating only a local variable and pointing to the desired module:  90  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns   var myFunction = function    {        dependencies     var event = YAHOO.util.Event,         dom = YAHOO.util.Dom;         use event and dom variables        for the rest of the function... };  This is an extremely simple pattern, but at the same time it has numerous benefits:    Explicit declaration of dependencies signals to the users of your code the specific  script files that they need to make sure are included in the page.    Upfront declaration at the top of the function makes it easy to find and resolve  dependencies.    Working with a local variable  such as dom  is always faster than working with a global  such as YAHOO  and even faster than working with nested properties of a global variable  such as YAHOO.util.Dom , resulting in better performance. When following  this  dependency  declaration  pattern,  the  global  symbol  resolution  is performed only once in the function. After that the local variable is used, which is much faster.    Advanced minification tools such as YUICompressor and Google Closure compiler will rename local variables  so event will likely become just one character such as A , resulting in smaller code, but never global variables, because it’s not safe to do so.  The  following  snippet  is  an  illustration  of  the  effect  of  the  dependency  declaration pattern on the minified code. Although test2  , which follows the pattern, looks a bit more involved because it requires more lines of code and an extra variable, it actually results in less code after minification, meaning less code the user has to download:   * minified test1 body: alert MYAPP.modules.m1 ;alert MYAPP.modules.m2 ;alert MYAPP.modules.m51  *   function test1   {     alert MYAPP.modules.m1 ;     alert MYAPP.modules.m2 ;     alert MYAPP.modules.m51 ; }  function test2   {     var modules = MYAPP.modules;     alert modules.m1 ;     alert modules.m2 ;     alert modules.m51 ; }   * minified test2 body:  Declaring Dependencies   91   var a=MYAPP.modules;alert a.m1 ;alert a.m2 ;alert a.m51  *   Private Properties and Methods JavaScript has no special syntax to denote private, protected, or public properties and methods, unlike Java or other languages. All object members are public:  var myobj = {     myprop: 1,     getProp: function    {         return this.myprop;     } }; console.log myobj.myprop ;    `myprop` is publicly accessible console.log myobj.getProp   ;    getProp   is public too  The same is true when you use constructor functions to create objects; all members are still public:  function Gadget   {     this.name = 'iPod';     this.stretch = function    {         return 'iPad';     }; } var toy = new Gadget  ; console.log toy.name ;    `name` is public console.log toy.stretch   ;    stretch   is public  Private Members Although the language doesn’t have special syntax for private members, you can im- plement them using a closure. Your constructor functions create a closure and any variables that are part of the closure scope are not exposed outside the constructor. However, these private variables are available to the public methods: methods defined inside the constructor and exposed as part of the returned objects. Let’s see an example where name is a private member, not accessible outside the constructor:  function Gadget   {        private member     var name = 'iPod';        public function     this.getName = function    {         return name;     }; } var toy = new Gadget  ;     `name` is undefined, it's private console.log toy.name ;    undefined  92  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns      public method has access to `name` console.log toy.getName   ;    "iPod"  As you can see, it’s easy to achieve privacy in JavaScript. All you need to do is wrap the data you want to keep private in a function and make sure it’s local to the function, which means not making it available outside the function.  Privileged Methods The notion of privileged methods doesn’t involve any specific syntax; it’s just a name given to the public methods that have access to the private members  and hence have more privileges . In  the  previous  example,  getName    is  a  privileged  method  because  it  has  “special” access to the private property name.  Privacy Failures There are some edge cases when you’re concerned about privacy:    Some  earlier  versions  of  Firefox  enable  a  second  parameter  to  be  passed  to eval   that is a context object enabling you to sneak into the private scope of the function. Similarly the __parent__ property in Mozilla Rhino would enable you access  to  private  scope.  These  edge  cases  don’t  apply  to  widely  used  browsers today.    When you’re directly returning a private variable from a privileged method and this variable happens to be an object or array, then outside code can modify the private variable because it’s passed by reference.  Let’s examine the second case a little more closely. The following implementation of Gadget looks innocent: function Gadget   {        private member     var specs = {         screen_width:  320,         screen_height: 480,         color: "white"     };         public function     this.getSpecs = function    {         return specs;     }; }  var toy = new Gadget  ,     specs = toy.getSpecs  ;  The problem here is that getSpecs   returns a reference to the specs object. This enables the user of Gadget to modify the seemingly hidden and private specs:  Private Properties and Methods   93   specs.color = "black"; specs.price = "free";  console.dir toy.getSpecs   ;  This result of printing to the Firebug console is shown in Figure 5-2.  Figure 5-2. The private object was modified  The solution to this unexpected behavior is to be careful not to pass references to objects and arrays you want to keep private. One way to achieve this is to have getSpecs   return a new object containing only some of the data that could be interesting to the consumer of the object. This is also known as Principle of Least Authority  POLA , which states that you should never give more than needed. In this case, if the consumer of Gadget is interested whether the gadget fits a certain box, it needs only the dimen- sions. So instead of giving out everything, you can create getDimensions  , which re- turns a new object containing only width and height. You may not need to implement getSpecs   at all. Another  approach,  when  you  need  to  pass  all  the  data,  is  to  create  a  copy  of  the specs object, using a general-purpose object-cloning function. The next chapter offers two such functions—one is called extend   and does a shallow copy of the given object  copies only the top-level parameters . The other one is called extendDeep  , which does a deep copy, recursively copying all properties and their nested properties.  Object Literals and Privacy So far we’ve looked only at examples of using constructors to achieve privacy. But what about the cases when your objects are created with object literals? Is it still possible to have private members? As you saw before, all you need is a function to wrap the private data. So in the case of object literals, you can use the closure created by an additional anonymous immediate function. Here’s an example:  var myobj;    this will be the object  function    {        private members     var name = "my, oh my";         implement the public part        note -- no `var`  94  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns   The  same  idea  but  with  slightly  different  implementation  is  given  in  the  following example:      myobj = {            privileged method         getName: function    {             return name;         }     }; }   ;  myobj.getName  ;    "my, oh my"  var myobj =  function    {        private members     var name = "my, oh my";         implement the public part     return {         getName: function    {             return name;         }     }; }   ;  myobj.getName  ;    "my, oh my"  This example is also the bare bones of what is known as “module pattern,” which we examine in just a bit.  Prototypes and Privacy One drawback of the private members when used with constructors is that they are re- created every time the constructor is invoked to create a new object. This is actually a problem with any members you add to this inside of constructors. To avoid the duplication of effort and save memory, you can add common properties and methods to the prototype property of the constructor. This way the common parts are shared among all the instances created with the same constructor. You can also share the hidden private members among the instances. To do so you can use a com- bination of two patterns: private properties inside constructors and private properties in object literals. Because the prototype property is just an object, it can be created with the object literals. Here’s an example of how you can achieve this:  function Gadget   {        private member     var name = 'iPod';        public function     this.getName = function    {         return name;     };  Private Properties and Methods   95   }  Gadget.prototype =  function    {        private member     var browser = "Mobile Webkit";        public prototype members     return {         getBrowser: function    {             return browser;         }     }; }   ;  var toy = new Gadget  ; console.log toy.getName   ;    privileged "own" method console.log toy.getBrowser   ;    privileged prototype method  Revealing Private Functions As Public Methods The revelation pattern is about having private methods, which you also expose as public methods. This could be useful when all the functionality in an object is critical for the workings of the object and you want to protect it as much as possible. But at the same time you want to provide public access to some of this functionality because that could be useful, too. When you expose methods publicly, you make them vulnerable; some of the users of your public API may modify it, even involuntarily. In ECMAScript 5 you have the option to freeze an object, but not in the previous versions of the language. Enter the revelation pattern  the term coined by Christian Heilmann originally was “revealing module pattern” . Let’s  take  an  example,  building  on  top  of  one  of  the  privacy  patterns—the  private members in object literals:  var myarray;   function    {      var astr = "[object Array]",         toString = Object.prototype.toString;      function isArray a  {         return toString.call a  === astr;     }      function indexOf haystack, needle  {         var i = 0,             max = haystack.length;         for  ; i < max; i += 1  {             if  haystack[i] === needle  {                 return i;             }         }         return −1;     }  96  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns       myarray = {         isArray: isArray,         indexOf: indexOf,         inArray: indexOf     };  }   ;  Here  you  have  two  private  variables  and  two  private  functions—isArray    and indexOf  . Toward the end of the immediate function, the object myarray is populated with the functionality you decide is appropriate to make publicly available. In this case the same private indexOf   is exposed as both ECMAScript 5–style indexOf and PHP- inspired inArray. Testing the new myarray object:  myarray.isArray [1,2] ;    true myarray.isArray {0: 1} ;    false myarray.indexOf ["a", "b", "z"], "z" ;    2 myarray.inArray ["a", "b", "z"], "z" ;    2  Now if something unexpected happens, for example, to the public indexOf  , the pri- vate indexOf   is still safe and therefore inArray   will continue to work:  myarray.indexOf = null; myarray.inArray ["a", "b", "z"], "z" ;    2  Module Pattern The module pattern is widely used because it provides structure and helps organize your code as it grows. Unlike other languages, JavaScript doesn’t have special syntax for packages, but the module pattern provides the tools to create self-contained de- coupled pieces of code, which can be treated as black boxes of functionality and added, replaced, or removed according to the  ever-changing  requirements of the software you’re writing. The module pattern is a combination of several patterns described so far in the book, namely:    Namespaces   Immediate functions   Private and privileged members   Declaring dependencies  The first step is setting up a namespace. Let’s use the namespace   function from earlier in this chapter and start an example utility module that provides useful array methods:  MYAPP.namespace 'MYAPP.utilities.array' ;  The next step is defining the module. The pattern uses an immediate function that will provide private scope if privacy is needed. The immediate function returns an object—  Module Pattern  97   the actual module with its public interface, which will be available to the consumers of the module:  MYAPP.utilities.array =  function    {     return {            todo...     }; }   ;  Next, let’s add some methods to the public interface:  MYAPP.utilities.array =  function    {     return {         inArray: function  needle, haystack  {                ...         },         isArray: function  a  {                ...         }     }; }   ;  Using the private scope provided by the immediate function, you can declare some private properties and methods as needed. Right at the top of the immediate function will also be the place to declare any dependencies your module might have. Following the variable declarations, you can optionally place any one-off initialization code that helps set up the module. The final result is an object returned by the immediate function that contains the public API of your module:  MYAPP.namespace 'MYAPP.utilities.array' ;  MYAPP.utilities.array =  function    {             dependencies     var uobj  = MYAPP.utilities.object,         ulang = MYAPP.utilities.lang,             private properties         array_string = "[object Array]",         ops = Object.prototype.toString;             private methods            ...             end var         optionally one-time init procedures        ...         public API     return {          inArray: function  needle, haystack  {             for  var i = 0, max = haystack.length; i < max; i += 1  {                 if  haystack[i] === needle  {  98  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns                       return true;                 }             }         },          isArray: function  a  {             return ops.call a  === array_string;         }            ... more methods and properties     }; }   ;  The module pattern is a widely used and highly recommended way to organize your code, especially as it grows.  Revealing Module Pattern We already discussed the revelation pattern in this chapter while looking at the privacy patterns. The module pattern can be organized in a similar way, where all the methods are kept private and you only expose those that you decide at the end, while setting up the public API. The above can become:  MYAPP.utilities.array =  function    {             private properties     var array_string = "[object Array]",         ops = Object.prototype.toString,             private methods         inArray = function  haystack, needle  {             for  var i = 0, max = haystack.length; i < max; i += 1  {                 if  haystack[i] === needle  {                     return i;                 }             }             return −1;         },         isArray = function  a  {             return ops.call a  === array_string;         };            end var         revealing public API     return {         isArray: isArray,         indexOf: inArray     }; }   ;  Module Pattern  99   Modules That Create Constructors The preceding example produced an object MYAPP.utilities.array, but sometimes it’s more convenient to create your objects using constructor functions. You can still do that using the module pattern. The only difference is that the immediate function that wraps the module will return a function at the end, and not an object. Consider the following example of the module pattern that creates a constructor func- tion MYAPP.utilities.Array:  MYAPP.namespace 'MYAPP.utilities.Array' ;  MYAPP.utilities.Array =  function    {             dependencies     var uobj  = MYAPP.utilities.object,         ulang = MYAPP.utilities.lang,             private properties and methods...         Constr;             end var         optionally one-time init procedures        ...         public API -- constructor     Constr = function  o  {         this.elements = this.toArray o ;     };        public API -- prototype     Constr.prototype = {         constructor: MYAPP.utilities.Array,         version: "2.0",         toArray: function  obj  {             for  var i = 0, a = [], len = obj.length; i < len; i += 1  {                 a[i] = obj[i];             }             return a;         }     };         return the constructor        to be assigned to the new namespace     return Constr;  }   ;  The way to use this new constructor will be like so:  var arr = new MYAPP.utilities.Array obj ;  100  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns   Importing Globals into a Module In a common variation of the pattern, you can pass arguments to the immediate func- tion that wraps the module. You can pass any values, but usually these are references to global variables and even the global object itself. Importing globals helps speed up the global symbol resolution inside the immediate function, because the imported var- iables become locals for the function:  MYAPP.utilities.module =  function  app, global  {         references to the global object        and to the global app namespace object        are now localized  } MYAPP, this  ;  Sandbox Pattern The sandbox pattern addresses the drawbacks of the namespacing pattern, namely:    Reliance on a single global variable to be the application’s global. In the name- spacing pattern, there is no way to have two versions of the same application or library run on the same page, because they both need the same global symbol name, for example, MYAPP.  to   type  and  resolve  at  runtime,   for  example,    Long,  dotted  names  MYAPP.utilities.array.  As the name suggests, the sandbox pattern provides an environment for the modules to “play” without affecting other modules and their personal sandboxes. The pattern is heavily used in YUI version 3, for example, but keep in mind that the following discussion is a sample reference implementation and does not attempt to describe how YUI3’s sandbox implementation works.  A Global Constructor In the namespacing pattern you have one global object; in the sandbox pattern the single global is a constructor: let’s call it Sandbox  . You create objects using this con- structor, and you also pass a callback function, which becomes the isolated sandboxed environment for your code. Using the sandbox will look like this:  new Sandbox function  box  {        your code here... } ;  The  object  box  will  be  like  MYAPP  in  the  namespacing  example—it  will  have  all  the library functionality you need to make your code work.  Sandbox Pattern  101   Let’s add two more things to the pattern:    With some magic  enforcing new pattern from Chapter 3 , you can assume new and  not require it when creating the object.    The Sandbox   constructor can accept an additional configuration argument  or arguments  specifying names of modules required for this object instance. We want the code to be modular, so most of the functionality Sandbox   provides will be contained in modules.  With these two additional features, let’s see some examples of what the code for in- stantiating objects will look like. You can omit  new and create an object that uses some fictional “ajax” and “event” modules like so:  This example is similar to the preceding one, but this time module names are passed as individual arguments:  Sandbox ['ajax', 'event'], function  box  {        console.log box ; } ;  Sandbox 'ajax', 'dom', function  box  {        console.log box ; } ;  And how about using a wildcard “*” argument to mean “use all available modules”? For convenience, let’s also say that when no modules are passed, the sandbox will assume '*'. So two ways to use all available modules will be like:  And one more example of using the pattern illustrates how you can instantiate sandbox objects multiple times—and you can even nest them one within the other without the two interfering:  Sandbox '*', function  box  {        console.log box ; } ;  Sandbox function  box  {        console.log box ; } ;  Sandbox 'dom', 'event', function  box  {         work with dom and event      Sandbox 'ajax', function  box  {           another sandboxed "box" object           this "box" is not the same as           the "box" outside this function           ...            done with Ajax  102  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns       } ;  } ;         no trace of Ajax module here  As you can see from these examples, when using the sandbox pattern, you can protect the global namespace by having your code wrapped into callback functions. If you need, you can also use the fact that functions are objects and store some data as “static” properties of the Sandbox   constructor. And, finally, you can have different instances depending on the type of modules you need and those instances work independently of each other. Now let’s see how you can approach implementing the Sandbox   constructor and its modules to support all this functionality.  Adding Modules Before implementing the actual constructor, let’s see how we can approach adding modules. The Sandbox   constructor function is also an object, so you can add a static property called modules to it. This property will be another object containing key-value pairs where the keys are the names of the modules and the values are the functions that implement each module: Sandbox.modules = {};  Sandbox.modules.dom = function  box  {     box.getElement = function    {};     box.getStyle = function    {};     box.foo = "bar"; };  Sandbox.modules.event = function  box  {        access to the Sandbox prototype if needed:        box.constructor.prototype.m = "mmm";     box.attachEvent = function    {};     box.dettachEvent = function    {}; };  Sandbox.modules.ajax = function  box  {     box.makeRequest = function    {};     box.getResponse = function    {}; };  In this example we added modules dom, event, and ajax, which are common pieces of functionality in every library or complex web application. The functions that implement each module accept the current instance box as a pa- rameter and may add additional properties and methods to that instance.  Sandbox Pattern  103   Implementing the Constructor Finally, let’s implement the Sandbox   constructor  naturally, you would want to re- name  this  type  of  constructor  to  something  that  makes  sense  for  your  library  or application :  function Sandbox   {            turning arguments into an array     var args = Array.prototype.slice.call arguments ,            the last argument is the callback         callback = args.pop  ,            modules can be passed as an array or as individual parameters         modules =  args[0] && typeof args[0] === "string"  ? args : args[0],         i;         make sure the function is called        as a constructor     if  ! this instanceof Sandbox   {         return new Sandbox modules, callback ;     }         add properties to `this` as needed:     this.a = 1;     this.b = 2;         now add modules to the core `this` object        no modules or "*" both mean "use all modules"     if  !modules  modules === '*'  {         modules = [];         for  i in Sandbox.modules  {             if  Sandbox.modules.hasOwnProperty i   {                 modules.push i ;             }         }     }         initialize the required modules     for  i = 0; i < modules.length; i += 1  {         Sandbox.modules[modules[i]] this ;     }         call the callback     callback this ; }     any prototype properties as needed Sandbox.prototype = {     name: "My Application",     version: "1.0",     getName: function    {         return this.name;     } };  104  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns   The key items in the implementation are:    There’s  a  check  whether  this  is  an  instance  of  Sandbox  and  if  not   meaning  Sandbox   was called without new , we call the function again as a constructor.    You can add properties to this inside the constructor. You can also add properties  to the prototype of the constructor.    The required modules can be passed as an array of module names, or as individual arguments, or with the * wildcard  or omitted , which means we should load all available modules. Notice that in this example implementation we don’t worry about loading required functionality from additional files, but that’s definitely an option. This is something supported by YUI3 for example. You can load only the most basic module  also known as a “seed”  and whatever modules you require will be loaded from external files using a naming convention where the filenames correspond to module names.    When we know the required modules, we initialize them, which means we call the  function that implements each module.    The last argument to the constructor is the callback. The callback will be invoked at the end using the newly created instance. This callback is actually the user’s sandbox, and it gets a box object populated with all the requested functionality.  Static Members Static properties and methods are those that don’t change from one instance to another. In class-based languages, static members are created using special syntax and then used as if they were members of the class itself. For example, a static method max   of some MathUtils class would be invoked like MathUtils.max 3, 5 . This is an example of a public static member, which can be used without having to create an instance of the class. There can also be private static members—not visible to the consumer of the class but still shared among all the instances of the class. Let’s see how to implement both private and public static members in JavaScript.  Public Static Members In JavaScript there’s no special syntax to denote static members. But you can have the same  syntax  as  in  a  “classy”  language  by  using  a  constructor  function  and  adding properties to it. This works because constructors, like all other functions, are objects and  they  can  have  properties.  The  memoization  pattern  discussed  in  the  previous chapter employed the same idea—adding properties to a function. The following example defines a constructor Gadget with a static method isShiny   and a regular instance method setPrice  . The method isShiny   is a static method because it doesn’t need a specific gadget object to work  just like you don’t need a  Static Members   105   particular gadget to figure out that all gadgets are shiny . setPrice  , on the other hand, needs an object, because gadgets can be priced differently:     constructor var Gadget = function    {};     a static method Gadget.isShiny = function    {     return "you bet"; };     a normal method added to the prototype Gadget.prototype.setPrice = function  price  {     this.price = price; };     calling a static method Gadget.isShiny  ;    "you bet"     creating an instance and calling a method var iphone = new Gadget  ; iphone.setPrice 500 ;  Now let’s call these methods. The static isShiny   is invoked directly on the construc- tor, whereas the regular method needs an instance:  Attempting to call an instance method statically won’t work; same for calling a static method using the instance iphone object: typeof Gadget.setPrice;    "undefined" typeof iphone.isShiny;     "undefined"  Sometimes it could be convenient to have the static methods working with an instance too. This is easy to achieve by simply adding a new method to the prototype, which serves as a façade pointing to the original static method:  Gadget.prototype.isShiny = Gadget.isShiny; iphone.isShiny  ;    "you bet"  In such cases you need to be careful if you use this inside the static method. When you do Gadget.isShiny   then this inside isShiny   will refer to the Gadget constructor function. If you do iphone.isShiny   then this will point to iphone. One last example shows how you can have the same method being called statically and nonstatically and behave slightly different, depending on the invocation pattern. Here instanceof helps determine how the method was called:     constructor var Gadget = function  price  {     this.price = price; };     a static method Gadget.isShiny = function    {         this always works  106  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns       var msg = "you bet";      if  this instanceof Gadget  {            this only works if called non-statically         msg += ", it costs $" + this.price + '!';     }      return msg; };     a normal method added to the prototype Gadget.prototype.isShiny = function    {     return Gadget.isShiny.call this ; };  Testing a static method call:  Gadget.isShiny  ;    "you bet"  Testing an instance, nonstatic call:  var a = new Gadget '499.99' ; a.isShiny  ;    "you bet, it costs $499.99!"  Private Static Members The discussion so far was on public static methods; now let’s take a look at how you can implement private static members. By private static members, we mean members that are:    Shared by all the objects created with the same constructor function   Not accessible outside the constructor  Let’s look at an example where counter is a private static property in the constructor Gadget. In this chapter there was already a discussion on private properties, so this part is still the same—you need a function to act as a closure and wrap around the private members. Then let’s have the same wrapper function execute immediately and return a new function. The returned function value is assigned to the variable  Gadget and becomes the new constructor: var Gadget =  function    {         static variable property     var counter = 0;         returning the new implementation        of the constructor     return function    {         console.log counter += 1 ;     };  }   ;    execute immediately  Static Members   107   The new Gadget constructor simply increments and logs the private counter. Testing with several instances you can see that counter is indeed shared among all instances:  var g1 = new Gadget  ;    logs 1 var g2 = new Gadget  ;    logs 2 var g3 = new Gadget  ;    logs 3  Because we’re incrementing the counter with one for every object, this static property becomes an ID that uniquely identifies each object created with the Gadget constructor. The unique identifier could be useful, so why not expose it via a privileged method? Below  is  an  example  that  builds  upon  the  previous  and  adds  a  privileged  method getLastId   to access the static private property:     constructor var Gadget =  function    {         static variable property     var counter = 0,         NewGadget;         this will become the        new constructor implementation     NewGadget = function    {         counter += 1;     };         a privileged method     NewGadget.prototype.getLastId = function    {         return counter;     };         overwrite the constructor     return NewGadget;  }   ;    execute immediately  Testing the new implementation:  var iphone = new Gadget  ; iphone.getLastId  ;    1 var ipod = new Gadget  ; ipod.getLastId  ;      2 var ipad = new Gadget  ; ipad.getLastId  ;      3  108  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns  Static properties  both private and public  can be quite handy. They can contain meth- ods and data that are not instance-specific and don’t get re-created with every instance. In Chapter 7, when we discuss the singleton pattern, you can see an example imple- mentation that uses static properties to implement class-like singleton constructors.   Object Constants There are no constants in JavaScript, although many modern environments may offer you the const statement to create constants. As a workaround, a common approach is to use a naming convention and make vari- ables that shouldn’t be changed stand out using all caps. This convention is actually used in the built-in JavaScript objects:  Math.PI;    3.141592653589793 Math.SQRT2;    1.4142135623730951 Number.MAX_VALUE;    1.7976931348623157e+308  For your own constants you can adopt the same naming convention and add them as static properties to the constructor function:     constructor var Widget = function    {        implementation... };     constants Widget.MAX_HEIGHT = 320; Widget.MAX_WIDTH = 480;  The same convention can be applied for objects created with a literal; the constants could be normal properties with uppercase names. If you really want to have an immutable value, you can create a private property and provide a getter method, but no setter. This is probably overkill in many cases when you can get by with a simple convention, but it is still an option. The  following  example  is  an  implementation  of  a  general-purpose  constant  object, which provides these methods:  set name, value   To define a new constant  isDefined name   To check whether a constant exists  get name   To get the value of a constant  In this implementation, only primitive values are allowed as constants. Also some extra care is taken to assure that it’s okay to declare constants with names that happen to be names  of  built-in  properties,  such  as  toString  or  hasOwnProperty  by  using  a hasOwnProperty   check and additionally prepending all constant names with a ran- domly generated prefix:  var constant =  function    {     var constants = {},         ownProp = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,         allowed = {  Object Constants   109               string: 1,             number: 1,             boolean: 1         },         prefix =  Math.random   + "_" .slice 2 ;     return {         set: function  name, value  {             if  this.isDefined name   {                 return false;             }             if  !ownProp.call allowed, typeof value   {                 return false;             }             constants[prefix + name] = value;             return true;         },         isDefined: function  name  {             return ownProp.call constants, prefix + name ;         },         get: function  name  {             if  this.isDefined name   {                 return constants[prefix + name];             }             return null;         }     }; }   ;  Testing the implementation:     check if defined constant.isDefined "maxwidth" ;    false     define constant.set "maxwidth", 480 ;    true     check again constant.isDefined "maxwidth" ;    true     attempt to redefine constant.set "maxwidth", 320 ;    false     is the value still intact? constant.get "maxwidth" ;    480  Chaining Pattern The chaining pattern enables you to call methods on an object one after the other, without assigning the return values of the previous operations to variables and without having to split your calls on multiple lines:  myobj.method1 "hello" .method2  .method3 "world" .method4  ;  110  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns   When you create methods that have no meaningful return value, you can have them return this, the instance of the object they are working with. This will enable consumers of that object to call the next method chained to the previous:  var obj = {     value: 1,     increment: function    {         this.value += 1;         return this;     },     add: function  v  {         this.value += v;         return this;     },     shout: function    {         alert this.value ;     } };     chain method calls obj.increment  .add 3 .shout  ;    5     as opposed to calling them one by one obj.increment  ; obj.add 3 ; obj.shout  ;    5  Pros and Cons of the Chaining Pattern A benefit of using the chaining pattern is that you can save some typing and create more concise code that almost reads like a sentence. Another benefit is that it helps you think about splitting your functions and creating smaller, more specialized functions, as opposed to functions that try to do too much. This improves the maintainability in the long run. A drawback is that it gets harder to debug code written this way. You may know that an error occurs on a specific line, but there’s just too much going on in this line. When one of the several methods you’ve chained fails silently, you have no idea which one. Robert Martin, author of the book Clean Code, goes so far as to call this a “train wreck” pattern. In any event, it’s good to recognize this pattern, and when a method you write has no obvious and meaningful return value, you can always return this. The pattern is widely used, for example, in the jQuery library. And if you look at the DOM API, you can notice that it’s also prone to chaining with constructs such as: document.getElementsByTagName 'head' [0].appendChild newnode ;  Chaining Pattern  111   method   Method JavaScript could be confusing to programmers who are used to thinking in terms of classes. That’s why some developers opt to make JavaScript more class-like. One such attempt is the idea of the method   method introduced by Douglas Crockford. In ret- rospect, he admits that making JavaScript class-like is not a recommended approach, but  nevertheless  it’s  an  interesting  pattern,  and  you  might  come  across  it  in  some applications. Using constructor functions looks like using classes in Java. They also enable you to add instance properties to this inside of the constructor body. However, adding meth- ods to this is inefficient, because they end up being re-created with every instance and that consumes more memory. That’s why reusable methods should be added to the prototype property of the constructor. The prototype may look alien to many devel- opers, so you can hide it behind a method.  Adding convenient functionality to a language is often referred to as syntactic  sugar  or  simply  sugar.  In  this  case,  you  could  call  the method   method a “sugar method.”  The way to define a “class” using the sugar method   would look like the following:  var Person = function  name  {     this.name = name; }.     method 'getName', function    {         return this.name;     } .     method 'setName', function  name  {         this.name = name;         return this;     } ;  Note how the constructor is chained to the call to method  , which is in turn chained to the next method   call and so on. This follows the chaining pattern previously de- scribed and helps you define the whole “class” with a single statement. The method   takes two parameters:    The name of the new method   The implementation of the method  This new method is then added to the Person “class.” The implementation is just an- other function, and inside the implementation function this points to the object created by Person, as you would expect.  112  Chapter 5: Object Creation Patterns   Here’s how you can use Person   to create and use a new object:  var a = new Person 'Adam' ; a.getName  ;    'Adam' a.setName 'Eve' .getName  ;    'Eve'  Again, note the chaining pattern in action, made possible simply because setName   returned this. And finally, here’s how the method   method is implemented:  if  typeof Function.prototype.method !== "function"  {     Function.prototype.method = function  name, implementation  {         this.prototype[name] = implementation;         return this;     }; }  In the implementation of method  , first we do the due diligence of checking whether the method is not already implemented. If not, we proceed with adding the function passed as argument implementation to the prototype of the constructor. In this case this refers to the constructor function, the prototype of which is augmented.  Summary In this chapter you learned about different patterns to create objects that go beyond the basic patterns of using object literals and constructor functions. You learned about the namespacing pattern that keeps the global space clean and helps organize and structure the code. You also learned about the simple, yet surprisingly helpful pattern of declaring dependencies. Then there was a detailed discussion on pri- vacy patterns including private members, privileged methods, some edge cases with privacy, the use of object literals with private members, and revealing private methods as public ones. All these patterns are the building blocks for the popular and powerful module pattern. Then you learned about the sandbox pattern as an alternative to the long namespacing, which also helps you create independent environments for your code and modules. To wrap up the discussion, we took a deep look into object constants, static methods  both public and private , chaining, and a curious method   method.  Summary  113    CHAPTER 6 Code Reuse Patterns  Code reuse is an important and interesting topic simply because it’s natural to strive for writing as little and reusing as much as possible from existing code, which you or someone else has already written. Especially if it’s good, tested, maintainable, exten- sible, and documented code. When talking about code reuse, the first thing that comes to mind is inheritance, and a great deal of the chapter is dedicated to this topic. You see several ways to do “clas- sical” and nonclassical inheritance. But it’s important to keep the end goal in mind— we want to reuse cod;. Inheritance is one way  means  for us to reach that goal. And it’s not the only way. You see how you can compose objects from other objects, how to use object mix-ins, and how you can borrow and reuse only the functionality you need without technically inheriting anything permanently. When approaching a code reuse task, keep in mind the advice the Gang of Four book has to offer on object creation: “Prefer object composition to class inheritance.”  Classical Versus Modern Inheritance Patterns Often you hear the term “classical inheritance” in discussions on the topic of inheri- tance in JavaScript, so let’s first clarify what classical means. The term is not used in the sense of something antique, settled, or widely accepted as the proper way of doing things. The term is just a play on the word “class.” Many programming languages have the notion of classes as blueprints for objects. In those languages every object is an instance of a specific class and  in the case of Java, for example  an object cannot be created if the class for it doesn’t exist. In JavaScript, because there are no classes, the notion of instances of classes doesn’t make much sense. Objects in JavaScript are simply key-value pairs, which you can create and change on the fly. But JavaScript has constructor functions, and the syntax of the new operator resembles a lot the syntax of using classes.  115   In Java you could do something like:  Person adam = new Person  ;  In JavaScript you would do: var adam = new Person  ;  Other than the fact that Java is strongly typed and you need to declare that adam is of type Person, the syntax looks the same. JavaScript’s constructor invocation looks as if Person were a class, but it’s important to keep in mind that Person is still just a function. The similarity in syntax has led many developers to think about JavaScript in terms of classes and to develop ideas and inheritance patterns that assume classes. Such imple- mentations we can call “classical.” Let’s also say that “modern” are any other patterns that do not require you to think about classes. When it comes to adopting an inheritance pattern for your project, you have quite a few options. You should always strive for picking a modern pattern, unless the team is really uncomfortable if there are no classes involved. This chapter discusses classical patterns first and then moves on to the modern ones.  Expected Outcome When Using Classical Inheritance The goal of implementing classical inheritance is to have objects created by one con- structor function Child   get properties that come from another constructor Parent  .  Although the discussion is about classical patterns, let’s avoid using the word “class.” Saying “constructor function” or “constructor” is longer, but it’s accurate and not ambiguous. In general, strive for eliminating the word “class” when communicating within your team, because when it comes to JavaScript, the word may mean different things to different people.  Here’s an example of defining the two constructors Parent   and Child  :     the parent constructor function Parent name  {     this.name = name  'Adam'; }     adding functionality to the prototype Parent.prototype.say = function    {     return this.name; };     empty child constructor function Child name  {}  116  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns      inheritance magic happens here inherit Child, Parent ;  Here you have the parent and child constructors, a method say   added to the parent constructor’s prototype, and a call to a function called inherit   that takes care of the inheritance. The inherit   function is not provided by the language, so you have to implement it yourself. Let’s see several approaches to implementing it in a generic way.  Classical Pattern 1—The Default Pattern The default method most commonly used is to create an object using the  Parent   constructor and assign this object to the Child  ’s prototype. Here’s the first imple- mentation of the reusable inherit   function:  function inherit C, P  {     C.prototype = new P  ; }  It’s important to remember that the prototype property should point to an object, not a function, so it has to point to an instance  an object  created with the parent con- structor, not to the constructor itself. In other words, pay attention to the new operator, because you need it for this pattern to work. Later in your application when you use new Child   to create an object, it gets func- tionality  from  the  Parent    instance  via  the  prototype,  as  shown  in  the  following example:  var kid = new Child  ; kid.say  ;    "Adam"  Following the Prototype Chain Using this pattern you inherit both own properties  instance-specific properties added to this, such as name  and prototype properties and methods  such as say   . Let’s review how the prototype chain works in this inheritance pattern. For the pur- poses of this discussion, let’s think of the objects as blocks somewhere in memory, which can contain data and references to other blocks. When you create an object using new Parent  , you create one such block  marked block 2 on Figure 6-1 . It holds the data for the  name property. If you attempt to access the  say   method, though  for example, using  new Parent .say   , block 2 doesn’t contain that method. But using the  hidden  link  __proto__  that  points  to  the  prototype  property  of  the  constructor function Parent  , you gain access to object 1  Parent.prototype , which does know about the say   method. All that happens behind the scenes and you don’t need to worry about it, but it’s important to know how it works and where the data you’re accessing or maybe modifying is. Note that __proto__ is used here to explain the pro- totype chain; this property is not available in the language itself, although it’s provided in some environments  for example, Firefox .  Classical Pattern 1—The Default Pattern  117   Figure 6-1. Prototype chain for the Parent   constructor  Now  let’s  see  what  happens  when  a  new  object  is  created  using  var  kid  =  new Child   after using the inherit   function. The diagram is shown on Figure 6-2.  Figure 6-2. Prototype chain after inheritance  The  Child    constructor  was  empty  and  no  properties  were  added  to Child.prototype;  therefore,  using  new  Child    creates  objects  that  are  pretty  much empty, except for the hidden link __proto__. In this case, __proto__ points to the new Parent   object created in the inherit   function. Now what happens when you do kid.say  ? Object 3 doesn’t have such a method, so it looks up to 2 via the prototype chain. Object 2 doesn’t have it either, so it follows the chain up to 1, which does happen to have it. Then inside say   there’s a reference to this.name, which needs to be resolved. The lookup starts again. In this case, this points to object 3, which doesn’t have name. Object 2 is consulted and it does have a name property, with the value “Adam.”  118  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns   Finally, let’s take a look at one more step. Let’s say we have this code:  var kid = new Child  ; kid.name = "Patrick"; kid.say  ;    "Patrick"  Figure 6-3 shows how the chain will look in this case.  Figure 6-3. Prototype chain after inheritance and adding a property to the child object  Setting the kid.name doesn’t change the name property of object 2, but it creates an own property directly on the kid object 3. When you do kid.say  , the method say is looked up in object 3, then 2, and then finally found in 1, just as before. But this time looking up this.name  which is the same as kid.name  is quick, because the property is found right away in object 3. If you remove the new property using delete kid.name, then the name property of object 2 will “shine through” and be found in consecutive lookups.  Drawbacks When Using Pattern 1 One drawback of this pattern is that you inherit both own properties added to this and prototype properties. Most of the time you don’t want the own properties, because they are likely to be specific to one instance and not reusable.  A general rule of thumb with constructors is that the reusable members should be added to the prototype.  Classical Pattern 1—The Default Pattern  119   Another thing about using a generic inherit   function is that it doesn’t enable you to pass parameters to the child constructor, which the child then passes to the parent. Consider this example:  var s = new Child 'Seth' ; s.say  ;    "Adam"  This is not what you’d expect. It’s possible for the child to pass parameters to the parent’s constructor, but then you have to do the inheritance every time you need a new child, which is inefficient, because you end up re-creating parent objects over and  over.  Classical Pattern 2—Rent-a-Constructor This next pattern solves the problem of passing arguments from the child to the parent. It borrows the parent constructor, passing the child object to be bound to this and also forwarding any arguments:  function Child a, c, b, d  {     Parent.apply this, arguments ; }  This way you can only inherit properties added to this inside the parent constructor. You don’t inherit members that were added to the prototype. Using the borrowed constructor pattern, the children objects get copies of the inherited members, unlike the classical 1 pattern where they only get references. The following example illustrates the difference:     a parent constructor function Article   {     this.tags = ['js', 'css']; } var article = new Article  ;     a blog post inherits from an article object    via the classical pattern 1 function BlogPost   {} BlogPost.prototype = article; var blog = new BlogPost  ;    note that above you didn't need `new Article  `    because you already had an instance available     a static page inherits from article    via the rented constructor pattern function StaticPage   {     Article.call this ; } var page = new StaticPage  ;  alert article.hasOwnProperty 'tags'  ;    true alert blog.hasOwnProperty 'tags'  ;    false alert page.hasOwnProperty 'tags'  ;    true  120  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns   In this snippet, the parent Article   is inherited in two ways. The default pattern causes the blog object to gain access to the tags property via the prototype, so it doesn’t have it as an own property and hasOwnProperty   returns false. The page object has an own tags property because using the rented constructor the new object got a copy of  not a reference to  the parent’s tags member. Note the difference when modifying the inherited tags property:  blog.tags.push 'html' ; page.tags.push 'php' ; alert article.tags.join ', '  ;    "js, css, html"  In this example the child blog object modifies the tags property, and this way it also modifies the parent because essentially both blog.tags and article.tags point to the same array. Changes to page.tags don’t affect the parent article because page.tags is a separate copy created during inheritance.  The Prototype Chain Let’s take a look at how the prototype chain looks when using this pattern and the familiar Parent   and Child   constructors. Child   will be slightly modified to follow the new pattern:     the parent constructor function Parent name  {     this.name = name  'Adam'; }     adding functionality to the prototype Parent.prototype.say = function    {     return this.name; };     child constructor function Child name  {     Parent.apply this, arguments ; }  var kid = new Child "Patrick" ; kid.name;    "Patrick" typeof kid.say;    "undefined"  If you take a look at Figure 6-4, you’ll notice that there’s no longer a link between the new Child object and the Parent. That’s because Child.prototype was not used at all, and it simply points to a blank object. Using this pattern, kid got its own property name, but the say   method was never inherited, and an attempt to call it will result in an error. The inheritance was a one-off action that copied parent’s own properties as child’s own properties and that was about it; no __proto__ links were kept.  Classical Pattern 2—Rent-a-Constructor   121   Figure 6-4. The broken chain when using the borrowing constructor pattern  Multiple Inheritance by Borrowing Constructors Using the borrowing constructors patterns, it’s possible to implement multiple inher- itance simply by borrowing from more than one constructor:  function Cat   {     this.legs = 4;     this.say = function    {         return "meaowww";     } }  function Bird   {     this.wings = 2;     this.fly = true; }  function CatWings   {     Cat.apply this ;     Bird.apply this ; }  var jane = new CatWings  ; console.dir jane ;  The result is shown in Figure 6-5. Any duplicate properties will be resolved by having the last one win.  122  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns   Figure 6-5. A CatWings object inspected in Firebug  Pros and Cons of the Borrowing Constructor Pattern The drawback of this pattern is obviously that nothing from the prototype gets inherited and,  as  mentioned  before,  the  prototype  is  the  place  to  add  reusable  methods  and properties, which will not be re-created for every instance. A benefit is that you get true copies of the parent’s own members, and there’s no risk that a child can accidentally overwrite a parent’s property. So how can the children inherit prototype properties too, in the previous case, and how can kid get access to the say   method? The next pattern addresses this question.  Classical Pattern 3—Rent and Set Prototype Combining the previous two patterns, you first borrow the constructor and then also set the child’s prototype to point to a new instance of the constructor:  function Child a, c, b, d  {     Parent.apply this, arguments ; } Child.prototype = new Parent  ;  The benefit is that the result objects get copies of the parent’s own members and ref- erences to the parent’s reusable functionality  implemented as members of the proto- type . The child can also pass any arguments to the parent constructor. This behavior is probably the closest to what you’d expect in Java; you inherit everything there is in the parent, and at the same time it’s safe to modify own properties without the risk of modifying the parent. A drawback is that the parent constructor is called twice, so it could be inefficient. At the end, the own properties  such as name in our case  get inherited twice. Let’s take a look at the code and do some testing:     the parent constructor function Parent name  {     this.name = name  'Adam'; }     adding functionality to the prototype Parent.prototype.say = function    {     return this.name;  Classical Pattern 3—Rent and Set Prototype  123   };     child constructor function Child name  {     Parent.apply this, arguments ; } Child.prototype = new Parent  ;  var kid = new Child "Patrick" ; kid.name;    "Patrick" kid.say  ;    "Patrick" delete kid.name; kid.say  ;    "Adam"  Unlike the previous pattern, now say   is inherited properly. You can also notice that name is inherited two times, and after we delete the own copy, the one that comes down the prototype chain will shine through. Figure 6-6 shows how the relationships between the objects work. The relationships are similar to those shown in Figure 6-3, but the way we got there was different.  Figure 6-6. The prototype chain is kept in addition to the inherited own members  Classical Pattern 4—Share the Prototype Unlike the previous classical inheritance pattern, which required two calls to the parent constructor, the next pattern doesn’t involve calling the parent constructor at all. The rule of thumb was that reusable members should go to the prototype and not this. Therefore for inheritance purposes, anything worth inheriting should be in the  124  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns   prototype.  So  you  can  just  set  the  child’s  prototype  to  be  the  same  as  the  parent’s prototype:  function inherit C, P  {     C.prototype = P.prototype; }  This gives you short and fast prototype chain lookups because all objects actually share the  same  prototype.  But  that’s  also  a  drawback  because  if  one  child  or  grandchild somewhere down the inheritance chain modifies the prototype, it affects all parents and grandparents. As Figure 6-7 shows, both child and parent objects share the same prototype and get equal access to the say   method. However, children objects don’t inherit the name property.  Figure 6-7. Relationships when sharing the same prototype  Classical Pattern 5—A Temporary Constructor The next pattern solves the same-prototype problem by breaking the direct link be- tween  parent’s  and  child’s  prototype  while  at  the  same  time  benefiting  from  the prototype chain. Below is an implementation of this pattern, where you have an empty function F  , which serves as a proxy between the child and the parent. F  ’s prototype property  points to the prototype of the parent. The prototype of the child is an instance of the blank function:  function inherit C, P  {     var F = function    {};     F.prototype = P.prototype;     C.prototype = new F  ; }  This pattern has a behavior slightly different from the default pattern  classical pattern 1  because here the child only inherits properties of the prototype  see Figure 6-8 .  Classical Pattern 5—A Temporary Constructor   125   Figure 6-8. Classical inheritance by using a temporary  proxy  constructor F    And  that’s  usually  fine,  actually  preferable,  because  the  prototype  is  the  place  for reusable functionality. In this pattern, any members that the parent constructor adds to this are not inherited. Let’s create a new child object and inspect its behavior:  var kid = new Child  ;  If you access kid.name it will be undefined. In this case name is an own property of the parent, and while inheriting we actually never called new Parent  , so this property was never even created. When you access kid.say  , it won’t be available in object 3, so the prototype chain is looked up. Object 4 doesn’t have this method either, but object 1 does and this is the same location in memory, which will be reused by all different constructors that inherit Parent   and all the objects created by all the children.  Storing the Superclass Building on top of the previous pattern, you can add a reference to the original parent. This is like having access to the superclass in other languages and could be handy on occasion. The property is called uber because “super” is a reserved word and “superclass” may lead the unsuspecting developer down the path of thinking that JavaScript has classes. Here’s an improved implementation of this classical pattern:  126  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns   function inherit C, P  {     var F = function    {};     F.prototype = P.prototype;     C.prototype = new F  ;     C.uber = P.prototype; }     parent, child, inheritance function Parent   {} function Child   {} inherit Child, Parent ;     testing the waters var kid = new Child  ; kid.constructor.name;    "Parent" kid.constructor === Parent;    true  function inherit C, P  {     var F = function    {};     F.prototype = P.prototype;     C.prototype = new F  ;     C.uber = P.prototype;     C.prototype.constructor = C; }  Resetting the Constructor Pointer One last thing to add to this almost perfect classical inheritance function is to reset the pointer to the constructor function in case you need it down the road. If you don’t reset the pointer to the constructor, then all children objects will report that Parent   was their constructor, which is not useful. So using the previous imple- mentation of inherit  , you can observe this behavior:  The constructor property is rarely used but could be convenient for runtime intro- spection of objects. You can reset it to point to the expected constructor function with- out affecting the functionality because this property is mostly informational. The final Holy Grail version of this classical inheritance pattern will look like so:  A function similar to this exists in the YUI library  and probably other libraries  and brings the classical inheritance to a language without classes, if you decide that this is the best approach for your project.  This pattern is also referred to as one using a proxy function or a proxy constructor, instead of a temporary constructor, because the temporary constructor is used as a proxy to get to the parent’s prototype.  A common optimization of the Holy Grail pattern is to avoid creating the temporary  proxy  constructor every time you need inheritance. It’s sufficient to create it once and  Classical Pattern 5—A Temporary Constructor   127   only change its prototype. You can use an immediate function and store the proxy function in its closure:  var inherit =  function    {     var F = function    {};     return function  C, P  {         F.prototype = P.prototype;         C.prototype = new F  ;         C.uber = P.prototype;         C.prototype.constructor = C;     } }   ;  Klass Many JavaScript libraries emulate classes, introducing new sugar syntax. The imple- mentations differ but there are often some commonalities, including the following:    There’s a convention on how to name a method, which is to be considered the constructor of the class, for example initialize, _init, or something similar and which gets called automatically.    Classes inherit from other classes.   There’s access to the parent class  superclass  from within the child class.  Let’s shift gears here and, in this part of the chapter only, use the word “class” freely because the topic is emulating classes.  Without going into too much detail, let’s see an example implementation of simulated classes in JavaScript. First, how will the solution be used from the client’s perspective?  var Man = klass null, {     __construct: function  what  {         console.log "Man's constructor" ;         this.name = what;     },     getName: function    {         return this.name;     } } ;  The syntax sugar comes in the form of a function called klass  . In some implemen- tations you may see it as Klass   constructor or as augmented Object.prototype, but in this example, let’s keep it a simple function. The function takes two parameters: a parent class to be inherited and implementation of the new class provided by an object literal. Influenced by PHP, let’s establish the convention that the class’s constructor must be a method called __construct. In the  128  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns   preceding snippet, a new class called Man is created and doesn’t inherit from anything  which means inherit from Object behind the scenes . The Man class has an own property name created inside __construct and a method getName  . The class is a constructor function, so the following will still work  and will look just like a class instantiation :  var first = new Man 'Adam' ;    logs "Man's constructor" first.getName  ;    "Adam"  Now let’s extend this class and create a SuperMan class:  var SuperMan = klass Man, {     __construct: function  what  {         console.log "SuperMan's constructor" ;     },     getName: function    {         var name = SuperMan.uber.getName.call this ;         return "I am " + name;     } } ;  Here,  the  first  parameter  to  klass    is  the  class  Man  to  be  inherited.  Notice  also  in getName   that the parent class’s getName   function is called first by using the uber  super  static property of SuperMan. Let’s test:  var clark = new SuperMan 'Clark Kent' ; clark.getName  ;    "I am Clark Kent"  The first line logs to the console “Man’s constructor” and then “Superman’s construc- tor.” In some languages the parent’s constructor is called automatically every time the child’s constructor is called, so why not emulate that as well? Testing that instanceof operator returns expected results:  Finally, let’s see how the klass   function can be implemented:  clark instanceof Man;    true clark instanceof SuperMan;    true  var klass = function  Parent, props  {      var Child, F, i;         1.        new constructor     Child = function    {         if  Child.uber && Child.uber.hasOwnProperty "__construct"   {             Child.uber.__construct.apply this, arguments ;         }         if  Child.prototype.hasOwnProperty "__construct"   {             Child.prototype.__construct.apply this, arguments ;         }     };         2.        inherit     Parent = Parent  Object;  Klass   129       F = function    {};     F.prototype = Parent.prototype;     Child.prototype = new F  ;     Child.uber = Parent.prototype;     Child.prototype.constructor = Child;         3.        add implementation methods     for  i in props  {         if  props.hasOwnProperty i   {             Child.prototype[i] = props[i];         }     }         return the "class"     return Child; };  The klass   implementation has three interesting and distinct parts:  1. A Child   constructor function is created. This is the function that will be returned at the end and will be used as a class. In this function the __construct method is called if it exists. Also before that the parent’s __construct is called  again, if it exists   using  the  static  uber  property.  There  might  be  cases  when  uber  is  not defined—when  you  inherit  from  Object  for  example,  as  the  case  was  with  the Man class definition.  2. The second part takes care of the inheritance bit. It’s simply using the classical inheritance’s Holy Grail pattern discussed in the previous section of the chapter. There’s only one new thing: setting the Parent to Object if no Parent was passed to inherit from.  3. The  final  section  is  looping  through  all  the  implementation  methods   such  as __construct and getName in the examples , which are the actual definition of the class and adding them to the prototype of Child.  When to use such a pattern? Well, it’s actually better if you avoid it, because it brings the whole confusing notion of classes, which don’t technically exist in the language. It adds new syntax and new rules to learn and remember. That said, if you or the team feel at ease with classes and at the same time feel uncomfortable with prototypes, then this could be something to explore. This pattern allows you to forget about the proto- types completely, and the good thing is you can tweak the syntax and the conventions to resemble another of your favorite languages.  Prototypal Inheritance Let’s start the discussion of “modern” classless patterns with a pattern called prototypal inheritance. In this pattern there are no classes involved; here objects inherit from other objects. You can think about it this way: you have an object that you would like to reuse and you want to create a second object that gets its functionality from the first one.  130  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns   Here’s how you would go about this:     object to inherit from var parent = {     name: "Papa" };     the new object var child = object parent ;     testing alert child.name ;    "Papa"  In the preceding snippet, you have an existing object called parent created with the object literal, and you want to create another object called child that has the same properties and methods as the parent. The child object was created with a function called object  . This function doesn’t exist in JavaScript  not to be mistaken with the constructor function Object   , so let’s see how you can define it. Similarly to the classical Holy Grail, you would use an empty temporary constructor function F  . You then set the prototype of F   to be the parent object. Finally, you return a new instance of the temporary constructor:  function object o  {     function F   {}     F.prototype = o;     return new F  ; }  Figure 6-9 shows the prototype chain when using the prototypal inheritance pattern. Here child always starts as an empty object, which has no properties of its own but at the same time has all the functionality of its parent by benefiting from the __proto__ link.  Figure 6-9. Prototypal inheritance pattern  Prototypal Inheritance  131   Discussion In the prototypal inheritance pattern, your parent doesn’t need to be created with the literal notation  although that is probably the more common way . You can have con- structor functions create the parent. Note that if you do so, both “own” properties and properties of the constructor’s prototype will be inherited:     parent constructor function Person   {        an "own" property     this.name = "Adam"; }    a property added to the prototype Person.prototype.getName = function    {     return this.name; };     create a new person var papa = new Person  ;    inherit var kid = object papa ;     test that both the own property    and the prototype property were inherited kid.getName  ;    "Adam"  In another variation of this pattern you have the option to inherit just the prototype object of an existing constructor. Remember, objects inherit from objects, regardless of how the parent objects were created. Here’s an illustration using the previous ex- ample, slightly modified:    parent constructor function Person   {        an "own" property     this.name = "Adam"; }    a property added to the prototype Person.prototype.getName = function    {     return this.name; };     inherit var kid = object Person.prototype ;  typeof kid.getName;    "function", because it was in the prototype typeof kid.name;    "undefined", because only the prototype was inherited  Addition to ECMAScript 5 In ECMAScript 5, the prototypal inheritance pattern becomes officially a part of the language. This pattern is implemented through the method Object.create  . In other  132  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns   words, you won’t need to roll your own function similar to object  ; it will be built into the language:  var child = Object.create parent ;  Object.create   accepts an additional parameter, an object. The properties of the extra object will be added as own properties of the new child object being returned. This is a convenience that enables you to inherit and build upon the child object with one method call. For example:  var child = Object.create parent, {     age: { value: 2 }    ECMA5 descriptor } ; child.hasOwnProperty "age" ;    true  YUI  .use '*', function  Y  {     var child = Y.Object parent ; } ;  You may also find that the prototypal inheritance pattern is implemented in JavaScript libraries; for example, in YUI3 it’s the Y.Object   method:  Inheritance by Copying Properties Let’s take a look at another inheritance pattern—inheritance by copying properties. In this pattern, an object gets functionality from another object, simply by copying it. Here’s an example implementation of a sample function extend   that does that:  function extend parent, child  {     var i;     child = child  {};     for  i in parent  {         if  parent.hasOwnProperty i   {             child[i] = parent[i];         }     }     return child; }  var dad = {name: "Adam"}; var kid = extend dad ; kid.name;    "Adam"  It’s a simple implementation, just looping through the parent’s members and copying them over. In this implementation child is optional; if you don’t pass an existing object to be augmented, then a brand new object is created and returned:  The implementation given is a so-called “shallow copy” of the object. A deep copy on the other hand would mean checking if the property you’re about to copy is an object or an array, and if so, recursively iterating through its properties and copying them as well. With the shallow copy  because objects are passed by reference in JavaScript , if you change a property of the child, and this property happens to be an object, then  Inheritance by Copying Properties   133   you’ll be modifying the parent as well. This is actually preferable for methods  as func- tions are also objects and are passed by reference  but could lead to surprises when working with other objects and arrays. Consider this:  var dad = {     counts: [1, 2, 3],     reads: {paper: true} }; var kid = extend dad ; kid.counts.push 4 ; dad.counts.toString  ;    "1,2,3,4" dad.reads === kid.reads;    true  Now let’s modify the extend   function to make deep copies. All you need is to check if a property’s type is an object, and if so, recursively copy its properties. Another check you need is if the object is a true object or if it’s an array. Let’s use the check for array- ness discussed in Chapter 3. So the deep copy version of extend   would look like so:  function extendDeep parent, child  {     var i,         toStr = Object.prototype.toString,         astr = "[object Array]";      child = child  {};      for  i in parent  {         if  parent.hasOwnProperty i   {             if  typeof parent[i] === "object"  {                 child[i] =  toStr.call parent[i]  === astr  ? [] : {};                 extendDeep parent[i], child[i] ;             } else {                 child[i] = parent[i];             }         }     }     return child; }  Now testing the new implementation gives us true copies of objects, so child objects don’t modify their parents:  var dad = {     counts: [1, 2, 3],     reads: {paper: true} }; var kid = extendDeep dad ;  kid.counts.push 4 ; kid.counts.toString  ;    "1,2,3,4" dad.counts.toString  ;    "1,2,3"  dad.reads === kid.reads;    false kid.reads.paper = false;  134  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns   kid.reads.web = true; dad.reads.paper;    true  This property copying pattern is simple and widely used; for example, Firebug  Firefox extensions are written in JavaScript  has a method called extend   that makes shallow copies  and  jQuery’s  extend    creates  a  deep  copy.  YUI3  offers  a  method  called Y.clone  , which creates a deep copy and also copies over functions by binding them to the child object.  There will be more on binding later in this chapter.  It’s worth noting that there are no prototypes involved in this pattern at all; it’s only about objects and their own properties.  Mix-ins Taking the idea of inheritance by property copying a step further, let’s consider a “mix- in” pattern. Instead of copying from one object, you can copy from any number of objects and mix them all into a new object. The implementation is simple; just loop through arguments and copy every property of every object passed to the function:  function mix   {     var arg, prop, child = {};     for  arg = 0; arg < arguments.length; arg += 1  {         for  prop in arguments[arg]  {             if  arguments[arg].hasOwnProperty prop   {                 child[prop] = arguments[arg][prop];             }         }     }     return child; }  Now that you have a generic mix-in function, you can pass any number of objects to it, and the result will be a new object that has the properties of all the source objects. Here is an example use:  var cake = mix     {eggs: 2, large: true},    {butter: 1, salted: true},    {flour: "3 cups"},    {sugar: "sure!"}  ;  Figure 6-10 shows the result of displaying the properties of the new mixed-in  cake objects by executing console.dir cake  in the Firebug console.  Mix-ins   135   Figure 6-10. Examining the cake object in Firebug  If you’re used to the mix-in concept from languages in which it’s an official part of the language, you might expect that changing one or more of the parents will affect the child, but that’s not true in the given im- plementation. Here we simply loop, copy own properties, and break the link with the parent s .  Borrowing Methods Sometimes it may happen that you only like one or two methods of an existing object. You want to reuse them, but you don’t really want to form a parent-child relationship with that object. You want to use just the methods you like, without inheriting all the other methods that you’ll never need. This is possible with the borrowing methods pattern, which benefits from the function methods call   and apply  . You’ve seen this  pattern  already  in  the  book  and  even  in  this  chapter  in  the  implementation  of extendDeep  , for example. As you know, functions in JavaScript are objects, and they come with some interesting methods of their own, such as call   and apply  . The only difference between the two is that one takes an array of parameters to be passed to the method being called, and the other one takes parameters one by one. You can use these methods to borrow functionality from existing objects:     call   example notmyobj.doStuff.call myobj, param1, p2, p3 ;    apply   example notmyobj.doStuff.apply myobj, [param1, p2, p3] ;  Here  you  have  an  object  called  myobj  and  you  know  that  some  other  object  called notmyobj has this useful method called doStuff  . Instead of going through the inher- itance hassle and inheriting a number of methods your myobj will never need, you can simply borrow the method doStuff   temporarily. You pass your object and any parameters, and the borrowed method binds your object as its own this. Basically, your object pretends to be the other object for a bit to benefit from the method you like. It’s like getting an inheritance but without paying the in- heritance tax  where the “tax” comes in the form of extra properties and methods you have no need for .  136  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns   Example: Borrow from Array A common use for this pattern is borrowing array methods. Arrays have useful methods, which array-like objects such as arguments don’t have. So arguments can borrow array methods, such as the method slice  . Here’s one example:  function f   {     var args = [].slice.call arguments, 1, 3 ;     return args; }     example f 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ;    returns [2,3]  In this example, there’s an empty array created just for the sake of using its method. A slightly longer way to do the same is to borrow the method directly from Array’s pro- totype, using Array.prototype.slice.call ... . This way is a little longer to type, but you’ll save the work of creating one empty array.  Borrow and Bind When borrowing methods either through call   apply   or through simple assign- ment, the object that this points to inside of the borrowed method is determined based on the call expression. But sometimes it’s best to have the value of this “locked” or bound to a specific object and predetermined in advance. Let’s see an example. There’s an object called one that has a say   method:  var one = {     name: "object",     say: function  greet  {         return greet + ", " + this.name;     } };     test one.say 'hi' ;    "hi, object"  var two = {     name: "another object" };  Now another object two doesn’t have a say   method, but it can borrow it from one:  one.say.apply two, ['hello'] ;    "hello, another object"  In the preceding case, this inside say   pointed to two and this.name was therefore “another object.” But what about scenarios in which you assign the function pointer to a global variable or you pass the function as a callback? In client-side programming there are a lot of events and callbacks, so that does happen a lot:     assigning to a variable    `this` will point to the global object  Borrowing Methods   137   var say = one.say; say 'hoho' ;    "hoho, undefined"     passing as a callback var yetanother = {     name: "Yet another object",     method: function  callback  {         return callback 'Hola' ;     } }; yetanother.method one.say ;    "Holla, undefined"  In both of those cases this inside say   was pointing to the global object, and the whole snippet didn’t work as expected. To fix  in other words, bind  an object to a method, we can use a simple function like this:  function bind o, m  {     return function    {         return m.apply o, [].slice.call arguments  ;     }; }  This bind   function accepts an object o and a method m, binds the two together, and then returns another function. The returned function has access to o and m via a closure. Therefore even after bind   returns, the inner function will have access to o and m, which will always point to the original object and method. Let’s create a new function using bind  :  var twosay = bind two, one.say ; twosay 'yo' ;    "yo, another object"  As you can see, even though twosay   was created as a global function, this didn’t point to the global object, but it pointed to object two, which was passed to bind  . Regardless of how you call twosay  , this will always be bound to two. The price you pay for the luxury of having a bind is the additional closure.  Function.prototype.bind   ECMAScript 5 adds a method bind   to Function.prototype, making it just as easy to use as apply   and call  . So you can do expressions like:  var newFunc = obj.someFunc.bind myobj, 1, 2, 3 ;  This means bind together someFunc   and myobj and also prefill the first three arguments that someFunc   expects. This is also an example of partial function application dis- cussed in Chapter 4. Let’s see how you can implement Function.prototype.bind   when your program runs in pre-ES5 environments:  if  typeof Function.prototype.bind === "undefined"  {     Function.prototype.bind = function  thisArg  {         var fn = this,  138  Chapter 6: Code Reuse Patterns               slice = Array.prototype.slice,             args = slice.call arguments, 1 ;          return function    {             return fn.apply thisArg, args.concat slice.call arguments   ;         };     }; }  This implementation probably looks a bit familiar; it’s using partial application and concatenating the list of arguments—those passed to bind    except the first  and those passed when the new function returned by bind   is called later. Here’s an example use:  var twosay2 = one.say.bind two ; twosay2 'Bonjour' ;    "Bonjour, another object"  In the preceding example, we didn’t pass any parameters to bind   other than the object to be bound. In the next example, let’s pass an argument to be partially applied:  var twosay3 = one.say.bind two, 'Enchanté' ; twosay3  ;    "Enchanté, another object"  Summary There are many options available when it comes to inheritance in JavaScript. It’s ben- eficial to study and understand the different patterns because they help improve your grasp of the language. In this chapter you learned about several classical and several modern patterns to approach inheritance. However, inheritance is probably not a problem you face often during development. This is partially due to the fact that this problem is probably already solved in some way or another by the library you use—and partially because it’s rare that you need to establish long and complicated inheritance chains in JavaScript. In static strongly typed languages, inheritance may be the only way to reuse code. In JavaScript you may often have much simpler and elegant ways, including borrowing methods, binding them, copying properties, and mixing-in properties from several objects. Remember  that  code  reuse  is  the  goal,  and  inheritance  is  just  one  of  the  ways  to accomplish that goal.  Summary  139    CHAPTER 7 Design Patterns  The design patterns from the Gang of Four book offer solutions to common problems related to the object-oriented software design. They have been around for quite a while and have been proven useful in many situations. That’s why it’s good to familiarize yourself with them and to talk about them. Although  these  design  patterns  are  language-independent  and  implementation- agnostic, they have been studied for many years, mainly from the perspective of strongly typed static-class languages, such as C++ and Java. JavaScript, being an untyped dynamic prototype-based language, sometimes makes it surprisingly easy, even trivial, to implement some of these patterns. Let’s start with the first example of how things are different in JavaScript compared to a static class-based language—the singleton pattern.  Singleton The idea of the singleton pattern is to have only one instance of a specific class. This means that the second time you use the same class to create a new object, you should get the same object that was created the first time. And how does this apply to JavaScript? In JavaScript there are no classes, just objects. When you create a new object, there’s actually no other object like it, and the new object is already a singleton. Creating a simple object using the object literal is also an example of a singleton:  var obj = {     myprop: 'my value' };  141   In JavaScript, objects are never equal unless they are the same object, so even if you create an identical object with the exact same members, it won’t be the same as the first one:  var obj2 = {     myprop: 'my value' }; obj === obj2;    false obj == obj2;     false  So you can say that every time you create an object using the object literal, you’re actually creating a singleton, and there’s no special syntax involved.  Note that sometimes when people say “singleton” in a JavaScript con- text, they mean the module pattern discussed in Chapter 5.  Using new JavaScript doesn’t have classes, so the verbatim definition for singleton doesn’t tech- nically make sense. But JavaScript has the new syntax for creating objects using con- structor functions, and sometimes you might want a singleton implementation using this syntax. The idea is that when you use new to create several objects using the same constructor, you should get only new pointers to the exact same object.  Usefulness warning: The following discussion is not so useful as a prac- tical pattern but more as a theoretical exercise in imitating the work- arounds for issues related to the designs of some  statically, strongly typed   class-based  languages  in  which  functions  are  not  first-class objects.  The following snippet shows the expected behavior  assuming that you dismiss the idea of the Multiverse and accept that there’s only one Universe out there :  var uni  = new Universe  ; var uni2 = new Universe  ; uni === uni2;    true  In this example, uni is created only the first time the constructor is called. The second time  and the third, fourth, and so on  the same uni object is returned. This is why uni === uni2—because they are essentially two references pointing to the exact same object. And how to achieve this in JavaScript? You need your Universe constructor to cache the object instance this when it’s created and then return it the second time the constructor is called. You have several options to achieve this:  142  Chapter 7: Design Patterns     You can use a global variable to store the instance. This is not recommended be- cause of the general principle that globals are bad. Plus, anyone can overwrite this global variable, even by accident. So let’s not discuss this option any further.    You can cache in a static property of the constructor. Functions in JavaScript are objects,  so  they  can  have  properties.  You  can  have  something  like Universe.instance and cache the object there. This is a nice, clean solution with the only drawback that the instance property is publicly accessible, and code out- side of yours might change it, so you lose the instance.    You can wrap the instance in a closure. This keeps the instance private and not available for modifications outside of your constructor at the expense of an extra closure.  Let’s take a look at an example implementation of the second and third options.  Instance in a Static Property Here’s  an  example  of  caching  the  singular  instance  in  a  static  property  of  the Universe constructor:  function Universe   {         do we have an existing instance?     if  typeof Universe.instance === "object"  {         return Universe.instance;     }         proceed as normal     this.start_time = 0;     this.bang = "Big";         cache     Universe.instance = this;         implicit return:        return this; }     testing var uni  = new Universe  ; var uni2 = new Universe  ; uni === uni2;    true  As you see, this is a straightforward solution with the only drawback that instance is public. It’s unlikely that other code will change it by mistake  much less likely than if instance was a global  but still possible.  Singleton  143   Instance in a Closure Another way to do the class-like singleton is to use a closure to protect the single in- stance. You can implement this by using the private static member pattern discussed in Chapter 5. The secret sauce here is to rewrite the constructor:  function Universe   {         the cached instance     var instance = this;         proceed as normal     this.start_time = 0;     this.bang = "Big";         rewrite the constructor     Universe = function    {         return instance;     }; }     testing var uni  = new Universe  ; var uni2 = new Universe  ; uni === uni2;    true     adding to the prototype Universe.prototype.nothing = true;  var uni  = new Universe  ;     again adding to the prototype    after the initial object is created Universe.prototype.everything = true;  var uni2 = new Universe  ;  Testing:     only the original prototype was    linked to the objects  144  Chapter 7: Design Patterns  The original constructor is called the first time and it returns this as usual. Then the second, third time, and so on the rewritten constrictor is executed. The rewritten con- structor has access to the private instance variable via the closure and simply returns it. This implementation is actually another example of the self-defining function pattern from Chapter 4. The drawback, as we discussed there, is that the rewritten function  in this case the constructor Universe    will lose any properties added to it between the moment of initial definition and the redefinition. In our specific case anything you add to the prototype of Universe   will not have a live link to the instance created with the original implementation. Here’s how you can see the problem with some testing:   The reason that uni.constructor is no longer the same as the Universe   constructor is because uni.constructor still points to the original constructor, not the redefined one. If getting the prototype and the constructor pointer working as expected is a require- ment, it’s possible to achieve this with a few tweaks:  uni.nothing;    true uni2.nothing;    true uni.everything;    undefined uni2.everything;    undefined     that sounds right: uni.constructor.name;    "Universe"     but that's odd: uni.constructor === Universe;    false  function Universe   {         the cached instance     var instance;         rewrite the constructor     Universe = function Universe   {         return instance;     };         carry over the prototype properties     Universe.prototype = this;         the instance     instance = new Universe  ;         reset the constructor pointer     instance.constructor = Universe;         all the functionality     instance.start_time = 0;     instance.bang = "Big";      return instance; }  Now all the test cases should work as expected:     update prototype and create instance Universe.prototype.nothing = true;    true var uni = new Universe  ; Universe.prototype.everything = true;    true var uni2 = new Universe  ;     it's the same single instance uni === uni2;    true     all prototype properties work    no matter when they were defined  Singleton  145   uni.nothing && uni.everything && uni2.nothing && uni2.everything;    true    the normal properties work uni.bang;    "Big"    the constructor points correctly uni.constructor === Universe;    true  An alternative solution would also be to wrap the constructor and the instance in an immediate function. The first time the constructor is invoked, it creates an object and also points the private instance to it. From the second invocation on, the constructor simply returns the private variable. All the tests from the previous snippet will work as expected, too, with this new implementation:  var Universe;   function    {      var instance;      Universe = function Universe   {          if  instance  {             return instance;         }          instance = this;             all the functionality         this.start_time = 0;         this.bang = "Big";      };  }   ;  Factory The purpose of the factory is to create objects. It’s usually implemented in a class or a static method of a class, which has the following purposes:    Performs repeating operations when setting up similar objects   Offers a way for the customers of the factory to create objects without knowing  the specific type  class  at compile time  The second point is more important in static class languages in which it may be non- trivial to create instances of classes, which are not known in advance  in compile time . In JavaScript, this part of the implementation is quite easy. The objects created by the factory method  or class  are by design inheriting from the same parent object; they are specific subclasses implementing specialized functionality. Sometimes the common parent is the same class that contains the factory method.  146  Chapter 7: Design Patterns   Let’s see an example implementation where we have:    A common parent CarMaker constructor.   A static method of the CarMaker called factory  , which creates car objects.   Specialized  constructors  CarMaker.Compact,  CarMaker.SUV,  and  CarMaker. Convertible that inherit from CarMaker. All of them will be defined as static prop- erties of the parent so that we keep the global namespace clean, and so we also know where to find them when we need them.  Let’s first see how the finished implementation will be used:  var corolla  = CarMaker.factory 'Compact' ; var solstice = CarMaker.factory 'Convertible' ; var cherokee = CarMaker.factory 'SUV' ; corolla.drive  ;     "Vroom, I have 4 doors" solstice.drive  ;    "Vroom, I have 2 doors" cherokee.drive  ;    "Vroom, I have 17 doors"  This part:  var corolla = CarMaker.factory 'Compact' ;  is probably the most recognizable in the factory pattern. You have a method that accepts a type given as a string at runtime and then creates and returns objects of the requested type.  There  are  no  constructors  used  with  new  or  any  object  literals  in  sight,  just  a function that creates objects based on a type identified by a string. Here’s an example implementation of the factory pattern that would make the code in preceding snippet work:    parent constructor function CarMaker   {}     a method of the parent CarMaker.prototype.drive = function    {     return "Vroom, I have " + this.doors + " doors"; };     the static factory method CarMaker.factory = function  type  {     var constr = type,         newcar;         error if the constructor doesn't exist     if  typeof CarMaker[constr] !== "function"  {         throw {             name: "Error",             message: constr + " doesn't exist"         };     }         at this point the constructor is known to exist        let's have it inherit the parent but only once     if  typeof CarMaker[constr].prototype.drive !== "function"  {  Factory  147           CarMaker[constr].prototype = new CarMaker  ;     }        create a new instance     newcar = new CarMaker[constr]  ;        optionally call some methods and then return...     return newcar; };     define specific car makers CarMaker.Compact = function    {     this.doors = 4; }; CarMaker.Convertible = function    {     this.doors = 2; }; CarMaker.SUV = function    {     this.doors = 24; };  There’s nothing particularly difficult about the implementation of the factory pattern. All you need to do is look for the constructor function that creates an object of the required type. In this case a simple naming convention was used to map object types to the constructors that create them. The inheritance part was just an example of a common repeating piece of code that could be put into the factory method instead of repeated for every constructor type.  Built-in Object Factory And for an example of “factory in the wild,” consider the built-in global Object   con- structor. It also behaves as a factory, because it creates different objects, depending on the input. If you pass it a primitive number, it can create an object with the Number   constructor behind the scenes. The same is true for the string and boolean values. Any other values, including no input values, will create a normal object. Here are some examples and tests of the behavior. Note that Object can be called with or without new:  var o = new Object  ,     n = new Object 1 ,     s = Object '1' ,     b = Object true ;     test o.constructor === Object;     true n.constructor === Number;     true s.constructor === String;     true b.constructor === Boolean;    true  148  Chapter 7: Design Patterns  The fact that Object   is also a factory is of little practical use, just something worth mentioning as an example that the factory pattern is all around us.   Iterator In the iterator pattern, you have an object containing some sort of aggregate data. This data may be stored internally in a complex structure, and you want to provide easy access to each element of that structure. The consumer of your object doesn’t need to know how you structure your data; all they need is to work with the individual elements. In the iterator pattern, your object needs to provide a next   method. Calling next   in sequence must return the next consecutive element, where it’s up to you to decide what “next” means in your particular data structure. Assuming that your object is called agg, you could access each data element by simply calling next   in a loop like so:  var element; while  element = agg.next    {        do something with the element ...     console.log element ; }  In the iterator pattern, the aggregate object usually also provides a convenience has Next   method, so the users of the object can determine if they’ve reached the end of your data. Another way to access all elements sequentially, this time using hasNext  , would be the like the following:  while  agg.hasNext    {        do something with the next element...     console.log agg.next   ; }  Now that we have the use cases, let’s see how to implement such an aggregate object. When implementing the iterator pattern, it makes sense to privately store the data and a pointer  index  to the next available element. To demonstrate a sample implemen- tation, let’s assume the data is just an ordinary array and the “special” logic for retrieval the next consecutive element will be to return every other array element:  var agg =  function    {      var index = 0,         data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],         length = data.length;      return {          next: function    {             var element;             if  !this.hasNext    {                 return null;             }             element = data[index];             index = index + 2;             return element;  Iterator   149           },          hasNext: function    {             return index < length;         }      }; }   ;  rewind    current    To provide easier access and ability to iterate several times over the data, your object may provide additional convenience methods:  To reset the pointer back to the beginning  To return the current element, because you cannot do this with next   without advancing the pointer  Implementing those methods will not present any difficulty:  var agg =  function    {         [snip...]      return {             [snip...]          rewind: function    {             index = 0;         },         current: function    {             return data[index];         }      }; }   ;  Now testing the iterator:     this loop logs 1, then 3, then 5 while  agg.hasNext    {     console.log agg.next   ; }     go back agg.rewind  ; console.log agg.current   ;    1  150  Chapter 7: Design Patterns  The result will be logging in the console: 1, 3, 5  from the loop  and finally 1  after the  rewind .   Decorator In the decorator pattern, additional functionality can be added to an object dynami- cally, at runtime. When dealing with static classes, this could be a challenge. In Java- Script, objects are mutable, so the process of adding functionality to an object is not a problem in itself. A convenient feature of the decorator pattern is the customization and configuration of the expected behavior. You start with your plain object, which has some basic func- tionality. Then you pick and choose from an available pool of decorators which ones you  want  to  use  to  enhance  your  plain  object  and  in  which  order,  if  the  order  is important.  Usage Let’s take a look into an example usage of the pattern. Say you’re working on a web application that sells something. Every new sale is a new sale object. The sale “knows” about the price of the item and can return it by calling the sale.getPrice   method. Depending on the circumstances, you can start decorating this object with extra func- tionality. Imagine a scenario where the sale for a customer is in the Canadian province of Québec. In this case the buyer needs to pay a federal tax and a provincial Québec tax. Following the decorator pattern, you’ll say that you “decorate” the object with a federal tax decorator and a Québec tax decorator. You can then also decorate the object with price formatting functionality. This scenario could look like the following:  var sale = new Sale 100 ;           the price is 100 dollars sale = sale.decorate 'fedtax' ;     add federal tax sale = sale.decorate 'quebec' ;     add provincial tax sale = sale.decorate 'money' ;      format like money sale.getPrice  ;                    "$112.88"  In another scenario the buyer could be in a province that doesn’t have a provincial tax, and you might also want to format the price using Canadian dollars, so you can do:  var sale = new Sale 100 ;           the price is 100 dollars sale = sale.decorate 'fedtax' ;     add federal tax sale = sale.decorate 'cdn' ;        format using CDN sale.getPrice  ;                    "CDN$ 105.00"  As you can see, this is a flexible way to add functionality and tweak an object at runtime. Let’s see how to approach an implementation of the pattern.  Implementation One way to implement the decorator pattern is to have each decorator be an object containing the methods that should be overwritten. Each decorator actually inherits the object enhanced so far after the previous decorator. Each decorated method calls  Decorator   151   the same method on the uber  the inherited object  and gets the value and proceeds with doing something in addition. The end effect is that when you do sale.getPrice   in the first usage example, you’re calling the method of the money decorator  see Figure 7-1 . But because each decorated method  first  calls  the  parent’s  method,  money’s  getPrice    first  calls  quebec’s getPrice  , which in turn calls fedtax’s getPrice   and so on. The chain goes all the way up to the original undecorated getPrice   implemented by the Sale   constructor.  Figure 7-1. Implementation of the decorator pattern  The implementation starts with a constructor and a prototype method:  function Sale price  {     this.price = price  100; } Sale.prototype.getPrice = function    {     return this.price; };  Sale.decorators = {};  The decorator objects will all be implemented as properties of a constructor property:  Let’s see one example decorator. It’s an object that implements the customized get Price   method. Note that the method first gets the value from the parent method and then modifies that value:  152  Chapter 7: Design Patterns   Similarly we can implement other decorators, as many as needed. They can be exten- sions to the core Sale   functionality, implemented like plugins. They can even “live” in additional files and be developed and shared by third-party developers:  Sale.decorators.fedtax = {     getPrice: function    {         var price = this.uber.getPrice  ;         price += price * 5   100;         return price;     } };  Sale.decorators.quebec = {     getPrice: function    {         var price = this.uber.getPrice  ;         price += price * 7.5   100;         return price;     } };  Sale.decorators.money = {     getPrice: function    {         return "$" + this.uber.getPrice  .toFixed 2 ;     } };  Sale.decorators.cdn = {     getPrice: function    {         return "CDN$ " + this.uber.getPrice  .toFixed 2 ;     } };  Finally let’s see the “magic” method called decorate   that ties all the pieces together. Remember it will be called like:  sale = sale.decorate 'fedtax' ;  The  'fedtax'  string  will  correspond  to  an  object  that’s  in Sale.decorators.fedtax. The newly decorated object newobj will inherit the object we have so far  either the original, or the one after the last decorator has been added , which is the object this. To do the inheritance part, let’s use the temporary constructor pattern from the previous chapter. We also set the uber property of newobj so the chil- dren have access to the parent. Then we copy all the extra properties from the decorator to the newly decorated object newobj. At the end, newobj is returned and, in our concrete usage example, it becomes the new updated sale object:  implemented   Sale.prototype.decorate = function  decorator  {     var F = function    {},         overrides = this.constructor.decorators[decorator],         i, newobj;     F.prototype = this;     newobj = new F  ;     newobj.uber = F.prototype;     for  i in overrides  {  Decorator   153           if  overrides.hasOwnProperty i   {             newobj[i] = overrides[i];         }     }     return newobj; };  Implementation Using a List Let’s  explore  a  slightly  different  implementation,  which  benefits  from  the  dynamic nature of JavaScript and doesn’t need to use inheritance at all. Also instead of having each decorated method call the method previously in the chain, we can simply pass the result of the previous method as a parameter to the next method. Such implementation could also allow for easy undecorating or undoing a decoration, which means simply removing an item from the list of decorators. The usage example will be slightly simpler because we don’t assign the return value from decorate   to the object. In this implementation, decorate   doesn’t do anything to the object, it simply appends to a list:  var sale = new Sale 100 ;    the price is 100 dollars sale.decorate 'fedtax' ;     add federal tax sale.decorate 'quebec' ;     add provincial tax sale.decorate 'money' ;      format like money sale.getPrice  ;             "$112.88"  The Sale   constructor now has a list of decorators as an own property:  function Sale price  {     this.price =  price > 0   100;     this.decorators_list = []; }  implemented  as  properties  of The  available  decorators  are  once  again  Sale.decorators. Note that the getPrice   methods are now simpler because they don’t call the parent getPrice   to get the intermediate result; this result is passed to them as a parameter:  Sale.decorators = {};  Sale.decorators.fedtax = {     getPrice: function  price  {         return price + price * 5   100;     } };  Sale.decorators.quebec = {     getPrice: function  price  {         return price + price * 7.5   100;     } };  Sale.decorators.money = {  154  Chapter 7: Design Patterns       getPrice: function  price  {         return "$" + price.toFixed 2 ;     } };  The interesting part happens in the parent’s decorate   and getPrice   methods. In the previous implementation, decorate   was somewhat complex and getPrice   was quite simple. In this implementation it’s the other way around: decorate   just appends to a list while getPrice   does all the work. The work includes going through the list of currently added decorators and calling each of the getPrice   methods, passing the result from the previous:  Sale.prototype.decorate = function  decorator  {     this.decorators_list.push decorator ; };  Sale.prototype.getPrice = function    {     var price = this.price,         i,         max = this.decorators_list.length,         name;     for  i = 0; i < max; i += 1  {         name = this.decorators_list[i];         price = Sale.decorators[name].getPrice price ;     }     return price; };  This second implementation of the decorator pattern is simpler, and there’s no inher- itance involved. The decorating methods are also simpler. All the work is done by the method that “agrees” to be decorated. In this sample implementation, getPrice   is the only method that allows decoration. If you want to have more methods that can be decorated, then the part of going through the list of decorators should be repeated by each additional method. However, this can be easily abstracted into a helper method that takes a method and makes it “decoratable.” In such an implementation the deco rators_list property would become an object with properties named after the methods and values being arrays of decorator objects.  Strategy The strategy pattern enables you to select algorithms at runtime. The clients of your code can work with the same interface but pick from a number of available algorithms to handle their specific task depending on the context of what they are trying to do. An example of using the strategy pattern would be solving the problem of form vali- dation.  You  can  create  one  validator  object  with  a  validate    method.  This  is  the method that will be called regardless of the concrete type of form and will always return the same result—a list of data that didn’t validate and any error messages.  Strategy  155   But depending on the concrete form and the data to be validated, the clients of your validator may choose different types of checks. Your validator picks the best strategy to handle the task and delegates the concrete data checks to the appropriate algorithm.  Data Validation Example Let’s say you have the following piece of data, probably coming from a form on a page, and you want to verify whether it’s valid:  var data = {     first_name: "Super",     last_name: "Man",     age: "unknown",     username: "o_O" };  validator.config = {     first_name: 'isNonEmpty',     age: 'isNumber',     username: 'isAlphaNum' };  For the validator to know what is the best strategy to use in this concrete example, you need to configure the validator first and set the rules of what you consider to be valid and acceptable. Let’s say you will not require a last name and you’ll accept anything for first name, but you require the age to be a number and the username to have letters and numbers only and no special symbols. The configuration will be something like:  Now  that  the  validator  object  is  configured  to  handle  your  data,  you  call  its validate   method and print any validation errors to the console:  validator.validate data ; if  validator.hasErrors    {     console.log validator.messages.join "\n"  ; }  This could print the following error messages:  Invalid value for *age*, the value can only be a valid number, e.g. 1, 3.14 or 2010 Invalid value for *username*, the value can only contain characters and numbers, no special symbols  Now let’s see how the validator is implemented. The available algorithms for the checks are objects with a predefined interface—they provide a validate   method and a one- line help information to be used in error messages:     checks for non-empty values validator.types.isNonEmpty = {     validate: function  value  {         return value !== "";     },     instructions: "the value cannot be empty"  156  Chapter 7: Design Patterns   };     checks if a value is a number validator.types.isNumber = {     validate: function  value  {         return !isNaN value ;     },     instructions: "the value can only be a valid number, e.g. 1, 3.14 or 2010" };     checks if the value contains only letters and numbers validator.types.isAlphaNum = {     validate: function  value  {         return ! [^a-z0-9] i.test value ;     },     instructions: "the value can only contain characters and numbers, no special symbols" };  And finally the core of the validator object:  var validator = {         all available checks     types: {},         error messages in the current        validation session     messages: [],         current validation config        name: validation type     config: {},         the interface method        `data` is key => value pairs     validate: function  data  {          var i, msg, type, checker, result_ok;             reset all messages         this.messages = [];          for  i in data  {              if  data.hasOwnProperty i   {                  type = this.config[i];                 checker = this.types[type];                  if  !type  {                     continue;    no need to validate                 }                 if  !checker  {    uh-oh                     throw {                         name: "ValidationError",                         message: "No handler to validate type " + type  Strategy  157                       };                 }                  result_ok = checker.validate data[i] ;                 if  !result_ok  {                     msg = "Invalid value for *" + i + "*, " + checker.instructions;                     this.messages.push msg ;                 }             }         }         return this.hasErrors  ;     },         helper     hasErrors: function    {         return this.messages.length !== 0;     } };  As you can see, the validator object is generic and could be kept like this for all vali- dation use cases. The way to improve it would be to add more types of checks. If you use it on several pages, soon you’ll have a nice collection of specific checks. Then all you  need  to  do  for  each  new  use  cases  is  to  configure  the  validator  and  run  the validate   method.  Façade The façade is a simple pattern; it provides only an alternative interface to an object. It’s a good design practice to keep your methods short and not have them handle too much work. Following this practice you’ll end up with a greater number of methods than if you have uber methods with lots of parameters. Sometimes two or more methods may commonly be called together. In such cases it makes sense to create another method that wraps the repeating method calls. For example, when handling browser events, you have the following methods:  stopPropagation    preventDefault    Traps the event and doesn’t let it bubble up to the parent nodes  Doesn’t let the browser do the default action  for example, following a link or submitting a form   These are two separate methods with different purposes, and they should be kept sep- arate, but at the same time, they are often called together. So instead of duplicating the two method calls all over the application, you can create a façade method that calls both of them:  var myevent =  {        ...     stop: function  e  {  158  Chapter 7: Design Patterns           e.preventDefault  ;         e.stopPropagation  ;     }        ... };  The façade pattern is also suitable for browser scripting where the differences between the browsers can be hidden behind a façade. Continuing from the previous example, you can add the code that handles the differences in IE’s event API:  var myevent =  {        ...     stop: function  e  {            others         if  typeof e.preventDefault === "function"  {             e.preventDefault  ;         }         if  typeof e.stopPropagation === "function"  {             e.stopPropagation  ;         }            IE         if  typeof e.returnValue === "boolean"  {             e.returnValue = false;         }         if  typeof e.cancelBubble === "boolean"  {             e.cancelBubble = true;         }     }        ... };  The façade pattern is also helpful with redesign and refactoring efforts. When you want to replace an object with a different implementation, you have to do it over a period of time  it’s a complex object , while at the same time new code is being written that uses this object. You can start with thinking about the new object’s API and then proceed to create a façade in front of the old object that follows the new API. This way, when you get to fully replacing the old object, you’ll have less client code to modify because any recent client code will already use the new API.  Proxy In the proxy design pattern, one object acts as an interface to another object. It’s dif- ferent from the façade pattern, where all you have is convenience methods that combine several other method calls. The proxy sits between the client of an object and the object itself and protects the access to that object. This pattern may look like overhead but it’s useful for performance purposes. The proxy serves as a guardian of the object  also called a “real subject”  and tries to have the real subject do as little work as possible.  Proxy  159   One example use would be something we can call lazy initialization. Imagine that ini- tializing the real subject is expensive, and it happens that the client initializes it but never actually uses it. In this case the proxy can help by being the interface to the real subject. The proxy receives the initialization request but never passes it on until it’s clear that the real subject is actually used. Figure 7-2 illustrates the scenario where the client makes an initialization request and the proxy responds that all is good but doesn’t actually pass on the message until it’s obvious that the client needs some work done by the subject. Only then does the proxy pass both messages together.  Figure 7-2. Relationship between client and real subject when going through a proxy  An Example The proxy pattern is useful when the real subject does something expensive. In web applications, one of the most expensive operations you can do is a network request, so it makes sense to combine HTTP requests as much as possible. Let’s take an example that does just that and demonstrates the proxy pattern in action.  A video expando Let’s have a little application that plays videos of a selected artist  Figure 7-3 . You can actually play with the live example and look at the code at http:  www.jspatterns.com  book 7 proxy.html. You have a list of video titles on a page. When the user clicks a video title, the area below the title expands to show more information about the video and also enables the video to be played. The detailed video information and the URL of the video are not part of the page; they need to be retrieved by making a web service call. The web service can accept multiple video IDs, so we can speed up the application by making fewer HTTP requests whenever possible and retrieving data for several videos at one time. Our application enables several  or all  videos to be expanded at the same time, so this is a perfect opportunity to combine web service requests.  160  Chapter 7: Design Patterns   Figure 7-3. Video expando in action Without a proxy The main “actors” in the application are the two objects:  videos  http  Responsible for info areas expand collapse  method videos.getInfo    and playing videos  method videos.getPlayer     Responsible for communication with the server via the method http.makeRequest    When there’s no proxy, videos.getInfo   will call http.makeRequest   once for every video. When we add a proxy, it will become a new actor called proxy and will be sitting between videos and http and delegating the calls to makeRequest  , combining them when possible.  Proxy  161   Let’s examine the code without the proxy first and then add the proxy to improve the responsiveness of the application.  HTML The HTML code is just a list of links:    Toggle Checked           <a         href="http:  new.music.yahoo.com videos --2158073">Gravedigger         <a         href="http:  new.music.yahoo.com videos --4472739">Save Me         <a         href="http:  new.music.yahoo.com videos --45286339">Crush         <a         href="http:  new.music.yahoo.com videos --2144530">Don't Drink The Water         <a         href="http:  new.music.yahoo.com videos --217241800">Funny the Way It Is         <a         href="http:  new.music.yahoo.com videos --2144532">What Would You Say      Event handlers Now let’s take a look at the event handlers. First we define the convenience shorthand $ function:  Using event delegation  more on this pattern in Chapter 8 , let’s handle all clicks oc- curring in the ordered list id="vids" with a single function:  var $ = function  id  {     return document.getElementById id ; };  $ 'vids' .onclick = function  e  {     var src, id;      e = e  window.event;     src = e.target  e.srcElement;      if  src.nodeName !== "A"  {         return;     }      if  typeof e.preventDefault === "function"  {         e.preventDefault  ;     }     e.returnValue = false;      id = src.href.split '--' [1];      if  src.className === "play"  {         src.parentNode.innerHTML = videos.getPlayer id ;         return;  162  Chapter 7: Design Patterns       }      src.parentNode.id = "v" + id;     videos.getInfo id ; };  In the catch-all click handler we’re interested in two clicks: one to expand collapse the info section  calling getInfo    and one to play the video  when the target has class name “play” , which means the info section has already been expanded, and we can then call getPlayer  . The IDs of the videos are extracted from the link hrefs. The other click handler reacts to clicks to toggle all info sections. It’s essentially just calling getInfo   again, but in a loop:  $ 'toggle-all' .onclick = function  e  {      var hrefs,         i,         max,         id;      hrefs = $ 'vids' .getElementsByTagName 'a' ;     for  i = 0, max = hrefs.length; i < max; i += 1  {            skip play links         if  hrefs[i].className === "play"  {             continue;         }            skip unchecked         if  !hrefs[i].parentNode.firstChild.checked  {             continue;         }          id = hrefs[i].href.split '--' [1];         hrefs[i].parentNode.id = "v" + id;         videos.getInfo id ;     } };  videos object The videos object has three methods:  getPlayer    updateList    getInfo    Returns HTML required to play the Flash video  not relevant to the discussion .  The callback that receives all the data from the web service and produces HTML code to be used in the expanded info section. There’s nothing particularly inter- esting happening in this method either.  The method that toggles the visibility of the info sections and also makes the calls to http passing updateList   as a callback.  Proxy  163   Here’s a snippet of the object:  var videos = {      getPlayer: function  id  {...},     updateList: function  data  {...},      getInfo: function  id  {          var info = $ 'info' + id ;          if  !info  {             http.makeRequest [id], "videos.updateList" ;             return;         }          if  info.style.display === "none"  {             info.style.display = '';         } else {             info.style.display = 'none';         }      } };  http object The http object has only one method, which makes the JSONP request to Yahoo!’s YQL web service:  var http = {     makeRequest: function  ids, callback  {         var url = 'http:  query.yahooapis.com v1 public yql?q=',             sql = 'select * from music.video.id where ids IN  "%ID%" ',             format = "format=json",             handler = "callback=" + callback,             script = document.createElement 'script' ;          sql = sql.replace '%ID%', ids.join '","'  ;         sql = encodeURIComponent sql ;          url += sql + '&' + format + '&' + handler;         script.src = url;          document.body.appendChild script ;     } };  YQL  Yahoo! Query Language  is a  meta web service that offers the ability to use SQL-like syntax to consume a number of other web serv- ices without having to study each service’s API.  164  Chapter 7: Design Patterns   When all six videos are toggled, six individual requests will be sent to the web service, with YQL queries that look like:  select * from music.video.id where ids IN  "2158073"   Enter the proxy The code as previously described works just fine, but we can do better. The proxy object enters the scene and takes over the communication between http and videos. It tries to combine the requests using a simple logic: a 50ms buffer. The videos object does not call the HTTP service directly but calls the proxy instead. The proxy then waits before forwarding the request. If other calls from videos come in the 50ms waiting period, they will be merged into one. A delay of 50ms is pretty much imperceptible for the user but can help combine requests and speed up the experience when clicking “toggle” and expanding more than one video at once. It also reduces the server load significantly since the web server has to handle a smaller number of requests. The combined YQL query for two videos will be like:  select * from music.video.id where ids IN  "2158073", "123456"   In the modified version of the code, the only change is that videos.getInfo   now calls proxy.makeRequest   instead of http.makeRequest  , as shown here:  proxy.makeRequest id, videos.updateList, videos ;  The proxy sets up a queue to collect the IDs of the videos received in the past 50ms and then flushes the queue calling http and provides its own callback function, because the videos.updateList   callback can handle only a single data record. Here’s the code for the proxy:  var proxy = {     ids: [],     delay: 50,     timeout: null,     callback: null,     context: null,     makeRequest: function  id, callback, context  {             add to the queue         this.ids.push id ;          this.callback = callback;         this.context  = context;             set up timeout         if  !this.timeout  {             this.timeout = setTimeout function    {                 proxy.flush  ;             }, this.delay ;  Proxy  165           http.makeRequest this.ids, "proxy.handler" ;          }     },     flush: function    {             clear timeout and queue         this.timeout = null;         this.ids = [];      },     handler: function  data  {         var i, max;             single video         if  parseInt data.query.count, 10  === 1  {             proxy.callback.call proxy.context, data.query.results.Video ;             return;         }             multiple videos         for  i = 0, max = data.query.results.Video.length; i < max; i += 1  {             proxy.callback.call proxy.context, data.query.results.Video[i] ;         }     } };  Introducing the proxy provides the ability to combine multiple web service requests into one with only a simple change to the original code. Figures 7-4 and 7-5 illustrate the scenarios of making three roundtrips to the server  without a proxy  versus one roundtrip when using a proxy.  Figure 7-4. Three roundtrips to the server  166  Chapter 7: Design Patterns   Figure 7-5. Using a proxy to combine and reduce the number of roundtrips to the server  Proxy As a Cache In this example the client object  videos  was smart enough not to request the video information for the same video again. But that may not always be the case. The proxy can go further in protecting the real subject http by caching the results of previous requests into a new cache property  see Figure 7-6 . Then if the videos object happens to request information about the same video ID for a second time, proxy can pull it out of the cache and save the network roundtrip.  Figure 7-6. The proxy cache  Mediator Applications—large and small—are made up of separate objects. All these objects need a way to communicate among themselves in a manner that doesn’t hurt maintenance and your ability to safely change a part of the application without breaking the rest of it. As the application grows, you add more and more objects. Then, during refactoring, objects are removed and rearranged. When objects know too much about each other and communicate directly  call each other’s methods and change properties  this leads to undesirable tight coupling. When objects are closely coupled, it’s not easy to change  Mediator   167   one object without affecting many others. Then even the simplest change in an appli- cation is no longer trivial, and it’s virtually impossible to estimate the time a change might take. The mediator pattern alleviates this situation promoting loose coupling and helping improve maintainability  see Figure 7-7 . In this pattern the independent objects  col- leagues  do not communicate directly, but through a mediator object. When one of the colleagues changes state, it notifies the mediator, and the mediator communicates the change to any other colleagues that should know about it.  Figure 7-7. Participants in the mediator pattern  Mediator Example Let’s explore an example of using the mediator pattern. The application will be a game where two players are given half a minute to compete for who will press a button more times than the other. Player 1 competes by pressing 1 and player 2 presses 0  so they are more comfortable and don’t have to fight over the keyboard . A scoreboard is up- dated with the current score. The participating objects will be:    Player 1   Player 2   Scoreboard   Mediator  168  Chapter 7: Design Patterns   The mediator knows about all other objects. It communicates with the input device  keyboard , handles keypress events, determines which player has a turn, and notifies it  see Figure 7-8 . The player plays  meaning just updates its own score with one point  and notifies the mediator that he’s done. The mediator communicates the updated score with the scoreboard, which in turn updates the display. Other than the mediator, none of the other objects knows anything about any other object. That makes it trivial to update the game, for example, by adding a new player or another display showing the remaining time. You can see the live version of the game and peek at the source at http:  jspatterns.com  book 7 mediator.html.  Figure 7-8. Participants in the keypress game  The player objects are created with a Player   constructor and have own properties points and name. The play   method from the prototype increments the points with one and then notifies the mediator:  function Player name  {     this.points = 0;     this.name = name; } Player.prototype.play = function    {     this.points += 1;     mediator.played  ; };  Mediator   169   The scoreboard object has an update   method, which gets called by the mediator object after every player’s turn. The scoreboard doesn’t know about any players and doesn’t keep score; it displays only the score given by the mediator:  var scoreboard = {         HTML element to be updated     element: document.getElementById 'results' ,         update the score display     update: function  score  {          var i, msg = '';         for  i in score  {             if  score.hasOwnProperty i   {                 msg += '  ' + i + ' : ';                 msg += score[i];                 msg += ' ';             }         }         this.element.innerHTML = msg;     } };  And now let’s take a look at the mediator object. It initializes the game, creating player objects in its setup   method, and keeps track of the players in its players property. The played   method is called by each player after each turn. This method updates a score hash and sends it to the scoreboard for display. The last method, keypress  , handles the keyboard events, determines which player has a turn, and notifies it:  var mediator = {         all the players     players: {},         initialization     setup: function    {         var players = this.players;         players.home = new Player 'Home' ;         players.guest = new Player 'Guest' ;      },         someone plays, update the score     played: function    {         var players = this.players,             score = {                 Home:  players.home.points,                 Guest: players.guest.points             };          scoreboard.update score ;     },  170  Chapter 7: Design Patterns          handle user interactions     keypress: function  e  {         e = e  window.event;    IE         if  e.which === 49  {    key "1"             mediator.players.home.play  ;             return;         }         if  e.which === 48  {    key "0"             mediator.players.guest.play  ;             return;         }     } };     go! mediator.setup  ; window.onkeypress = mediator.keypress;     game over in 30 seconds setTimeout function    {     window.onkeypress = null;     alert 'Game over!' ; }, 30000 ;  And the last thing is to set up and tear down the game:  Observer The  observer  pattern  is  widely  used  in  client-side  JavaScript  programming.  All  the browser events  mouseover, keypress, and so on  are examples of the pattern. Another name for it is also custom events, meaning events that you create programmatically, as opposed to the ones that the browser fires. Yet another name is subscriber publisher pattern. The main motivation behind this pattern is to promote loose coupling. Instead of one object calling another object’s method, an object subscribes to another object’s specific activity and gets notified. The subscriber is also called observer, while the object being observed is called publisher or subject. The publisher notifies  calls  all the subscribers when an important event occurs and may often pass a message in the form of an event object.  Example 1: Magazine Subscriptions To understand how to implement this pattern, let’s take a concrete example. Let’s say you have a publisher paper, which publishes a daily newspaper and a monthly maga- zine. A subscriber joe will be notified whenever that happens. The paper object needs to have a property subscribers that is an array storing all sub- scribers. The act of subscription is merely adding to this array. When an event occurs, paper loops through the list of subscribers and notifies them. The notification means  Observer   171   calling a method of the subscriber object. Therefore, when subscribing, the subscriber provides one of its methods to paper’s subscribe   method. The paper can also provide unsubscribe  , which means removing from the array of subscribers. The last important method of paper is publish  , which will call the sub- scribers’ methods. To summarize, a publisher object needs to have these members:  subscribers An array subscribe    unsubscribe    publish    Add to the array of subscribers  Remove from the subscribers array  Loop though subscribers and call the methods they provided when they signed up  All the three methods need a type parameter, because a publisher may fire several events  publish both a magazine and a newspaper  and subscribers may chose to subscribe to one, but not to the other. Because these members are generic for any publisher object, it makes sense to imple- ment them as part of a separate object. Then we can copy them over  mix-in pattern  to any object and turn any given object into a publisher. Here’s an example implementation of the generic publisher functionality, which defines all the required members previously listed plus a helper visitSubscribers   method:  var publisher = {     subscribers: {         any: []    event type: subscribers     },     subscribe: function  fn, type  {         type = type  'any';         if  typeof this.subscribers[type] === "undefined"  {             this.subscribers[type] = [];         }         this.subscribers[type].push fn ;     },     unsubscribe: function  fn, type  {         this.visitSubscribers 'unsubscribe', fn, type ;     },     publish: function  publication, type  {         this.visitSubscribers 'publish', publication, type ;     },     visitSubscribers: function  action, arg, type  {         var pubtype = type  'any',             subscribers = this.subscribers[pubtype],             i,             max = subscribers.length;          for  i = 0; i < max; i += 1  {  172  Chapter 7: Design Patterns               if  action === 'publish'  {                 subscribers[i] arg ;             } else {                 if  subscribers[i] === arg  {                     subscribers.splice i, 1 ;                 }             }         }     } };  And here’s a function that takes an object and turns it into a publisher by simply copying over the generic publisher’s methods:  function makePublisher o  {     var i;     for  i in publisher  {         if  publisher.hasOwnProperty i  && typeof publisher[i] === "function"  {             o[i] = publisher[i];         }     }     o.subscribers = {any: []}; }  Now let’s implement the paper object. All it can do is publish daily and monthly:  var paper = {     daily: function    {         this.publish "big news today" ;     },     monthly: function    {         this.publish "interesting analysis", "monthly" ;     } };  Making paper a publisher:  makePublisher paper ;  Now  that  we  have  a  publisher,  let’s  see  the  subscriber  object  joe,  which  has  two methods:  var joe = {     drinkCoffee: function  paper  {         console.log 'Just read ' + paper ;     },     sundayPreNap: function  monthly  {         console.log 'About to fall asleep reading this ' + monthly ;     } };  Now the paper subscribes joe  in other words joe subscribes to the paper :  paper.subscribe joe.drinkCoffee ; paper.subscribe joe.sundayPreNap, 'monthly' ;  Observer   173   As you see, joe provides a method to be called for the default “any” event and another method to be called when the “monthly” type of event occurs. Now let’s fire some events:  paper.daily  ; paper.daily  ; paper.daily  ; paper.monthly  ;  All these publications call joe’s appropriate methods and the result in the console is:  Just read big news today Just read big news today Just read big news today About to fall asleep reading this interesting analysis  The good part here is that the paper object doesn’t hardcode joe and joe doesn’t hard- code paper. There’s also no mediator object that knows everything. The participating objects are loosely coupled, and without modifying them at all, we can add many more subscribers to paper; also joe can unsubscribe at any time. Let’s take this example a step further and also make joe a publisher.  After all, with blogs and microblogs anyone can be a publisher.  So joe becomes a publisher and can post status updates on Twitter:  Now imagine that the paper’s public relations department decides to read what its readers tweet and subscribes to joe, providing the method readTweets  :  makePublisher joe ; joe.tweet = function  msg  {     this.publish msg ; };  paper.readTweets = function  tweet  {     alert 'Call big meeting! Someone ' + tweet ; }; joe.subscribe paper.readTweets ;  Now as soon as joe tweets, the paper is alerted:  joe.tweet "hated the paper today" ;  The result is an alert: “Call big meeting! Someone hated the paper today.” You can see the full source code and play in the console with a live demo at http:   jspatterns.com book 7 observer.html.  174  Chapter 7: Design Patterns   Example 2: The Keypress Game Let’s take another example. We’ll implement the same keypress game from the medi- ator pattern example but this time using the observer pattern. To make it slightly more advanced, let’s accept an unlimited number of players, not only two. We’ll still have the Player   constructor that creates player objects and the scoreboard object. Only the mediator will now become a game object. In the mediator pattern the mediator object knows about all other participating objects and calls their methods. The game object in the observer pattern will not do that; instead it will leave it to the objects to subscribe to interesting events. For example, the score board will subscribe to game’s “scorechange” event. Let’s first revisit the generic publisher object and tweak its interface a bit to make it closer to the browser world:    Instead of publish  , subscribe  , and unsubscribe  , we’ll have fire  , on  , and  remove  .  three functions.    The type of event will be used all the time, so it becomes the first argument to the    An extra context can be supplied in addition to the subscriber’s function to allow  the callback method to use this referring to its own object.  The new publisher object becomes:  var publisher = {     subscribers: {         any: []     },     on: function  type, fn, context  {         type = type  'any';         fn = typeof fn === "function" ? fn : context[fn];          if  typeof this.subscribers[type] === "undefined"  {             this.subscribers[type] = [];         }         this.subscribers[type].push {fn: fn, context: context  this} ;     },     remove: function  type, fn, context  {         this.visitSubscribers 'unsubscribe', type, fn, context ;     },     fire: function  type, publication  {         this.visitSubscribers 'publish', type, publication ;     },     visitSubscribers: function  action, type, arg, context  {         var pubtype = type  'any',             subscribers = this.subscribers[pubtype],             i,             max = subscribers ? subscribers.length : 0;          for  i = 0; i < max; i += 1  {             if  action === 'publish'  {  Observer   175                   subscribers[i].fn.call subscribers[i].context, arg ;             } else {                 if  subscribers[i].fn === arg && subscribers[i].context === context  {                     subscribers.splice i, 1 ;                 }             }         }     } };  The new Player   constructor becomes:  function Player name, key  {     this.points = 0;     this.name = name;     this.key  = key;     this.fire 'newplayer', this ; }  Player.prototype.play = function    {     this.points += 1;     this.fire 'play', this ; };  The new parts here are that the constructor accepts key, the keyboard key that the player presses to make points.  The keys were hardcoded before.  Also, every time a new player object is created, an event “newplayer” is fired. Similarly, every time a player plays, the event “play” is fired. The scoreboard object remains the same; it simply updates the display with the current score. The new game object can keep track of all players, so it can produce a score and fire a “scorechange” event. It will also subscribe to all “keypress” events from the browser and will know about the keys that correspond to each player:  var game = {      keys: {},      addPlayer: function  player  {         var key = player.key.toString  .charCodeAt 0 ;         this.keys[key] = player;     },      handleKeypress: function  e  {         e = e  window.event;    IE         if  game.keys[e.which]  {             game.keys[e.which].play  ;         }     },      handlePlay: function  player  {         var i,             players = this.keys,  176  Chapter 7: Design Patterns               score = {};          for  i in players  {             if  players.hasOwnProperty i   {                 score[players[i].name] = players[i].points;             }         }         this.fire 'scorechange', score ;     } };  The function makePublisher   that turns any object into a publisher is still the same as in the newspaper example. The game object becomes a publisher  so it can fire “score- change” events  and the Player.protoype becomes a publisher so that every player ob- ject can fire “play” and “newplayer” events to whomever decides to listen:  makePublisher Player.prototype ; makePublisher game ;  The game object subscribes to “play” and “newplayer” events  and also “keypress” from the browser , while the scoreboard subscribes to “scorechange”:  Player.prototype.on "newplayer", "addPlayer",  game ; Player.prototype.on "play",      "handlePlay", game ; game.on "scorechange", scoreboard.update, scoreboard ; window.onkeypress = game.handleKeypress;  As you see here, the on   method enables subscribers to specify the callback as a ref- erence to a function  scoreboard.update  or as a string  "addPlayer" . The string works as long as the context  for example, game  is also provided. The final bit of setup is to dynamically create player objects  with their corresponding keys to be pressed , as many as the user wants:  var playername, key; while  1  {     playername = prompt "Add player  name " ;     if  !playername  {         break;     }     while  1  {         key = prompt "Key for " + playername + "?" ;         if  key  {             break;         }     }     new Player playername,  key ; }  And that concludes the game. You can see the full source and play it at http:  jspatterns .com book 7 observer-game.html. Notice that in the mediator pattern implementation, the mediator object had to know about every other object to call the correct methods at the right time and coordinate the  whole  game.  Here  the  game  object  is  a  little  dumber  and  relies  on  the  objects  Observer   177   observing certain events and taking action: for example, the scoreboard listening to the “scorechange” event. This results in an even looser coupling  the less one object knows, the better  at the price of making it a little harder to keep track of who listens to what event. In this example game, all the subscriptions happened in the same place in the code, but as an application grows, the on   calls may be all over the place  for example, in each object’s initialization code . This will make it harder to debug, as there will be no single place to look at the code and understand what’s going on. In the observer pattern, you move away from the procedural sequential code execution where you start from the beginning and can follow the program to the end.  Summary In this chapter you learned about several popular design patterns and you saw how you could approach their implementation in JavaScript. The design patterns we discussed were:  Singleton  Factory  Iterator  Decorator  Strategy  Façade  Proxy  Creating only one object of a “class.” We looked at several approaches if you want to substitute the idea of a class with a constructor function and preserve the Java- like syntax. Otherwise, technically all objects in JavaScript are singletons. And also sometimes developers would say “singleton,” meaning objects created with the module pattern.

Summary  179    CHAPTER 8 DOM and Browser Patterns  In  the  previous  chapters  of  the  book,  the  main  focus  was  on  the  core  JavaScript  ECMAScript  and not so much on patterns for using JavaScript in the browser. In contrast, this chapter explores a number of browser-specific patterns, because this is the most common environment for JavaScript programs. Browser scripting is also what most people have in mind when they say they don’t like JavaScript. And that’s under- standable, given all the inconsistent host objects and DOM implementations that exist in the browsers. It’s obvious that we can benefit from any good practices that help make the client scripting less of a pain. In this chapter you see some patterns divided into several areas, including DOM script- ing, event handling, remote scripting, strategies for loading JavaScript on the page, and steps to deploying JavaScript to production websites. But  first,  let’s  start  with  a  brief  and  somewhat  philosophical  discussion  on  how  to approach client-side scripting.  Separation of Concerns The three main concerns in web application development are:  The HTML document  Content  Presentation  Behavior  The CSS styles that specify how the document looks  The JavaScript, which handles the user interaction and any dynamic changes to the document  Keeping the three concerns as separate as possible improves the delivery of the appli- cation to a vast array of user agents—graphic browsers, text-only browsers, assistive technology for disabled users, mobile devices, and so on. The separation of concerns also goes hand in hand with the idea of progressive enhancement—you start with the  181   basic experience  HTML only  for the simplest user agents and add more to the expe- rience as the user agent capabilities improve. If the browser supports CSS, then the user gets a better presentation of the document. If the browser supports JavaScript, then the document becomes more of an application that adds more features to enhance the experience. In practice, the separation of concerns means:    Testing the page with CSS turned off to see if the page is still usable and the content  is present and readable    Testing with JavaScript turned off and making sure the page can still perform its main purpose, all links work  no instances of href="" , and any forms still work and submit properly    Not using inline event handlers  such as onclick  or inline style attributes, because  these do not belong to the content layer    Using semantically meaningful HTML elements such as headings and lists  The JavaScript layer  the behavior  should be unobtrusive, meaning it shouldn’t be in the way of the user, it shouldn’t make the page unusable in unsupported browsers, and it shouldn’t be a requirement for the page to work. Instead it should just enhance the page. A common technique to handle browser differences elegantly is the capability detec- tion. It suggests that you shouldn’t use user agent sniffing to determine a code path, but you should check if a method or a property you want to use exists in the current environment. User agent sniffing is generally regarded as an antipattern. Sometimes it’s unavoidable, but it should be the last resort and only in cases where capability detection cannot give a conclusive result  or will cause a significant performance hit :     antipattern if  navigator.userAgent.indexOf 'MSIE'  !== −1  {     document.attachEvent 'onclick', console.log ; }     better if  document.attachEvent  {     document.attachEvent 'onclick', console.log ; }     or even more specific if  typeof document.attachEvent !== "undefined"  {     document.attachEvent 'onclick', console.log ; }  Separating concerns also helps development, maintenance, and ease of updates to an existing web application, because you know where to look when something breaks. When there’s a JavaScript error, you don’t need to look at the HTML or the CSS to fix it.  182  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns   DOM Scripting Working with the DOM tree of a page is one of the most common tasks in client-side JavaScript. This is also a major cause of headaches  and gives JavaScript a bad name  because the DOM methods are inconsistently implemented across browsers. That’s why using a good JavaScript library, which abstracts the browser differences, can sig- nificantly speed up development. Let’s see some recommended patterns when accessing and modifying the DOM tree, mainly addressing performance concerns.  DOM Access DOM access is expensive; it’s the most common bottleneck when it comes to JavaScript performance. This is because the DOM is usually implemented separately from the JavaScript engine. From a browser’s perspective, it makes sense to take this approach, because a JavaScript application may not need DOM at all. And also languages other than JavaScript  for example, VBScript in IE  can be used to work with the page’s DOM. The bottom line is that DOM access should be reduced to minimum. This means:    Avoiding DOM access in loops   Assigning DOM references to local variables and working with the locals   Using selectors API where available   Caching the length when iterating over HTML collections  see Chapter 2   Consider the following example where the second  better  loop, despite being longer, will be tens to hundreds of times faster, depending on the browser:     antipattern for  var i = 0; i < 100; i += 1  {     document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML += i + ", "; }     better - update a local variable var i, content = ""; for  i = 0; i < 100; i += 1  {     content += i + ","; } document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML += content;  In the next snippet, the second example  using a local variable style  is better, although it requires one more line of code and one more variable:     antipattern var padding = document.getElementById "result" .style.padding,     margin  = document.getElementById "result" .style.margin;     better var style   = document.getElementById "result" .style,  DOM Scripting  183       padding = style.padding,     margin  = style.margin;  Using selector APIs means using the methods:  document.querySelector "ul .selected" ; document.querySelectorAll "widget .class" ;  These methods accept a CSS selector string and return a list of DOM nodes that match the selection. The selector methods are available in modern browsers  and in IE since version 8  and will always be faster than if you do the selection yourself using other DOM methods. Recent versions of popular JavaScript libraries take advantage of the selector APIs, so you should make sure you use an up-to-date version of your preferred library. It will also help if you add id="" attributes to elements you’ll be accessing often, because document.getElementById myid  is the easiest and fastest way to find a node.  DOM Manipulation In addition to accessing the DOM elements, you often need to change them, remove some of them, or add new ones. Updating the DOM can cause the browser to repaint the  screen  and  also  often  reflow   recalculate  elements’  geometry ,  which  can  be expensive. Again, the general rule of thumb is to have fewer DOM updates, which means batching changes and performing them outside of the “live” document tree. When you need to create a relatively big subtree, you should do so without adding to the live document until the end. For this purpose you can use a document fragment to contain all your nodes. Here’s how not to append nodes:     antipattern    appending nodes as they are created  var p, t;  p = document.createElement 'p' ; t = document.createTextNode 'first paragraph' ; p.appendChild t ; document.body.appendChild p ;  p = document.createElement 'p' ; t = document.createTextNode 'second paragraph' ; p.appendChild t ; document.body.appendChild p ;  A better version will be to create a document fragment, update it “offline,” and add it to the live DOM when it’s ready. When you add a document fragment to the DOM tree, the content of the fragment gets added, not the fragment itself. And this is really  184  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns   convenient. So the document fragment is a good way to wrap a number of nodes even when you’re not containing them in a suitable parent  for example, your paragraphs are not in a div element . Here’s an example of using a document fragment:  var p, t, frag;  frag = document.createDocumentFragment  ;  p = document.createElement 'p' ; t = document.createTextNode 'first paragraph' ; p.appendChild t ; frag.appendChild p ;  p = document.createElement 'p' ; t = document.createTextNode 'second paragraph' ; p.appendChild t ; frag.appendChild p ;  document.body.appendChild frag ;  In this example the live document is updated only once, causing a single reflow repaint, as opposed to one for every paragraph, as was the case in the previous antipattern snippet. The document fragment is useful when you add new nodes to the tree. But when you update an existing part of the tree, you can still batch changes. You can make a clone of the root of the subtree you’re about to change, make all the changes to the clone, and then when you’re done, swap the original with the clone:  var oldnode = document.getElementById 'result' ,     clone = oldnode.cloneNode true ;     work with the clone...     when you're done: oldnode.parentNode.replaceChild clone, oldnode ;  Events Another area of browser scripting that is full of inconsistencies and a source of frus- tration is working with the browser events, such as click, mouseover, and so on. Again, a JavaScript library can take away much of the double work that needs to be done to support IE  before version 9  and the W3C-conforming implementations. Let’s go over the main points, because you may not always be using an existing library for simple pages and quick hacks, or you may be creating your own library.  Events   185   Event Handling It all starts with attaching event listeners to elements. Say you have a button that in- crements a counter each time you click it. You can add an inline onclick attribute and that will work across all browsers but will be violating the separation of concerns and the progressive enhancement. So you should strive for attaching the listener in Java- Script, outside of any markup. Say you have the following markup:   Click me: 0   You can assign a function to the onclick property of the node, but you can do this only once:     suboptimal solution var b = document.getElementById 'clickme' ,     count = 0; b.onclick = function    {     count += 1;     b.innerHTML = "Click me: " + count; };  If you want to have several functions executed on click, you cannot do it with this pattern while maintaining loose coupling. Technically you can check if onclick already contains a function and if so, add the existing one to your own function and replace the onclick value with your new function. But a much cleaner solution is to use the addEventListener   method. This method doesn’t exist in IE up to and including ver- sion 8, so you need attachEvent   for those browsers. When we looked at the init-time branching pattern  Chapter 4  you saw an example of  implementing  a  good  solution  for  defining  a  cross-browser  event  listener  utility. Without going into all the details right now, let’s just attach a listener to our button:  var b = document.getElementById 'clickme' ; if  document.addEventListener  {    W3C     b.addEventListener 'click', myHandler, false ; } else if  document.attachEvent  {    IE     b.attachEvent 'onclick', myHandler ; } else {    last resort     b.onclick = myHandler; }  Now when this button is clicked, the function myHandler   will be executed. Let’s have this function increment the number in the “Click me: 0” button label. To make it a little more interesting, let’s assume we have several buttons and a single myHandler   for all of them. Keeping a reference to each button node and a counter for the number will be inefficient, given that we can get that information from the event object that is created on every click. Let’s see the solution first and comment on it after:  186  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns   function myHandler e  {      var src, parts;         get event and source element     e = e  window.event;     src = e.target  e.srcElement;         actual work: update label     parts = src.innerHTML.split ": " ;     parts[1] = parseInt parts[1], 10  + 1;     src.innerHTML = parts[0] + ": " + parts[1];         no bubble     if  typeof e.stopPropagation === "function"  {         e.stopPropagation  ;     }     if  typeof e.cancelBubble !== "undefined"  {         e.cancelBubble = true;     }         prevent default action     if  typeof e.preventDefault === "function"  {         e.preventDefault  ;     }     if  typeof e.returnValue !== "undefined"  {         e.returnValue = false;     }  }  A live example is available at http:  jspatterns.com book 8 click.html. There are four parts in the event handler function:    First, we need to gain access to the event object, which contains information about the event and the page element that triggered that event. This event object is passed to the callback event handler, but not when using the onclick property where it’s accessible through the global property window.event instead.    The second part is doing the actual work of updating the label.   Next is canceling the propagation of the event. This is not required in this particular example, but in general if you don’t do it, then the event bubbles up all the way to the document root or even the window object. Again we need to do it two ways: the  W3C  standard  way   stopPropagation     and  then  differently  for  IE   using cancelBubble .    Finally, prevent the default action, if this is required. Some events  clicking a link, submitting  a  form   have  default  actions,  but  you  can  prevent  them  by  using preventDefault    or for IE, by setting returnValue to false .  As you see there’s quite a bit of duplicate work involved, so it makes sense to create your event utility with façade methods as discussed in Chapter 7.  Events   187   Event Delegation The event delegation pattern benefits from the event bubbling and reduces the number of event listeners attached to separate nodes. If there are 10 buttons inside a div element, you can have one event listener attached to the div as opposed to 10 listeners attached to each button. Let’s have an example with three buttons inside a div  see Figure 8-1 . A live demo of the event delegation example is available at http:  jspatterns.com book 8 click-delegate .html.  Figure 8-1. Event delegation example: three buttons that increment their labels on click  So we’re working with the following markup:       Click me: 0     Click me too: 0     Click me three: 0     Instead of attaching listeners to each button, you attach one to the “click-wrap” div. Then you can use the same myHandler   function from the previous example with only one little change: you have to filter out clicks you’re not interested in. In this case you look only for clicks on any button, so all other clicks in the same div could be ignored. The change to myHandler   would be to check if the nodeName of the source of the event is a “button”:     ...    get event and source element e = e  window.event; src = e.target  e.srcElement;  if  src.nodeName.toLowerCase   !== "button"  {     return; }    ...  The drawback of the event delegation is the slightly more code to filter out the events that  happen  in  the  container  that  are  not  interesting  for  you.  But  the  benefits— performance and cleaner code—outweigh the drawbacks significantly, so it’s a highly recommended pattern. Modern JavaScript libraries make it easy to use event delegation by providing conven- ient APIs. For example YUI3 has the method Y.delegate  , which enables you to specify a CSS selector to match the wrapper and another selector to match the nodes you’re interested  in.  This  is  convenient  because  your  callback  event  handler  function  will  188  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns   actually never be called when the event happens outside the nodes you care about. In this case, the code to attach an event listener would be simply:  Y.delegate 'click', myHandler, "click-wrap", "button" ;  And thanks to the abstraction of all browser differences done in YUI and the fact that the source of the event is determined for us, the callback function will be much simpler:  function myHandler e  {      var src = e.currentTarget,         parts;      parts = src.get 'innerHTML' .split ": " ;     parts[1] = parseInt parts[1], 10  + 1;     src.set 'innerHTML', parts[0] + ": " + parts[1] ;      e.halt  ; }  A live example is available at: http:  jspatterns.com book 8 click-y-delegate.html.  Long-Running Scripts You have noticed that sometimes the browser complains that a script has been running for too long and asks the user if the script should be stopped. You don’t want this to happen in your application, no matter how complicated your task is. Also, if the script works too hard, the browser’s UI becomes unresponsive to the point where the user cannot click anything. This is bad for the experience and should be avoided. In JavaScript there are no threads, but you can simulate them in the browser by using setTimeout   or, in more modern browsers, web workers.  setTimeout   The idea is to split a big amount of work into smaller chunks and perform each chunk with a timeout of 1ms. Using 1ms timeout chunks can cause the task to be completed slower overall, but the user interface will remain responsive, and the user is more com- fortable and in control of the browser.  Timeout of 1  or even 0 milliseconds  will actually become more than that, depending on the browser and the operating system. Setting a 0 timeout doesn’t mean right away, but rather “as soon as possible.” In Internet  Explorer,  for  example,  the  shortest  clock  “tick”  is  15 milliseconds.  Long-Running Scripts   189   Web Workers Recent browsers offer another solution to long-running scripts: web workers. Web workers provide background thread support in the browser. You put your heavy com- putations in a separate file, for example, my_web_worker.js, and then call it from the main program  page  like so:  var ww = new Worker 'my_web_worker.js' ; ww.onmessage = function  event  {     document.body.innerHTML +=         " message from the background thread: " + event.data + " "; };  The source for a web worker that does a simple arithmetic operation 1e8 times  1 with 8 zeros  is shown here:  var end = 1e8, tmp = 1;  postMessage 'hello there' ;  while  end  {     end -= 1;     tmp += end;     if  end === 5e7  {    5e7 is the half of 1e8         postMessage 'halfway there, `tmp` is now ' + tmp ;     } }  postMessage 'all done' ;  The worker uses postMessage   to communicate with the caller and the caller subscribes to the onmessage event to receive updates. The onmessage callback receives an event object as an argument and this object contains the property data, which can be anything that the worker wants to pass. Similarly the caller can pass data to the worker using  in this example  ww.postMessage   and the worker can subscribe to those messages using an onmessage callback. The previous example will print in the browser: message from the background thread: hello there message from the background thread: halfway there, `tmp` is now 3749999975000001 message from the background thread: all done  Remote Scripting Today’s web applications often use remote scripting to communicate with the server without  reloading  the  current  page.  This  enables  for  much  more  responsive  and desktop-like  web  applications.  Let’s  consider  a  few  ways  to  communicate  with  the server from JavaScript.  190  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns   XMLHttpRequest XMLHttpRequest is a special object  a constructor function  available in most browsers today, which lets you make an HTTP request from JavaScript. There are three steps to making a request:  1. Set up an XMLHttpRequest object  called XHR for short . 2. Provide a callback function to be notified when the request object changes state. 3. Send the request.  The first step is as easy as:  var xhr =  new XMLHttpRequest  ;  But in IE prior to version 7, the XHR functionality was implemented as an ActiveX object, so a special case is needed there. The second step is providing a callback to the readystatechange event:  xhr.onreadystatechange = handleResponse;  The last step is to fire off the request—using two methods  open   and send  . The open   method sets up the HTTP request method  for example, GET, POST  and the URL. The send   method passes any POST data or just a blank string in the case of GET.  The  last  parameter  to  open    specifies  whether  the  request  is  asynchronous. Asynchronous means that the browser will not block waiting for the response. This is definitely the better user experience, so unless there’s a strong reason against it, the asynchronous parameter should always be true:  xhr.open "GET", "page.html", true ; xhr.send  ;  Below is a complete working example of fetching the contents of a new page and up- dating the current page with the new content  demo available at http:  jspatterns.com  book 8 xhr.html :  var i, xhr, activeXids = [     'MSXML2.XMLHTTP.3.0',     'MSXML2.XMLHTTP',     'Microsoft.XMLHTTP' ];  if  typeof XMLHttpRequest === "function"  {    native XHR     xhr =  new XMLHttpRequest  ; } else {    IE before 7     for  i = 0; i < activeXids.length; i += 1  {         try {             xhr = new ActiveXObject activeXids[i] ;             break;         } catch  e  {}     } }  Remote Scripting  191   xhr.onreadystatechange = function    {     if  xhr.readyState !== 4  {         return false;     }     if  xhr.status !== 200  {         alert "Error, status code: " + xhr.status ;         return false;     }     document.body.innerHTML += " " + xhr.responseText + " "; };  xhr.open "GET", "page.html", true ; xhr.send "" ;  Some comments on the example:    Because of IE versions 6 and below, the process of creating a new XHR object is a little more complicated. We loop through a list of ActiveX identifiers from the latest to the earliest version and attempt to create an object, wrapping it in a try-catch block.    The callback function checks the readyState property of the xhr object. There are five possible values of that property—from 0 to 4—where 4 means “complete.” If the state is not yet complete, we keep waiting for the next readystatechange event.   The callback also checks the status property of the xhr object. This property cor- responds to the HTTP status code, for example, 200  OK  or 404  Not found . We’re only interested in the 200 response codes and report all others as errors  for simplicity; otherwise there are other valid status codes you could check for .    The code, as listed, will make a check for the supported way to create an XHR object every time a request is made. Having seen some patterns in previous chapters  for example, init-time branching , you could rewrite this to make the check only once.  JSONP JSONP  JSON with padding  is another way to make remote requests. Unlike XHR, it’s not restricted by the same-domain browser policy, so it should be used carefully because of the security implications of loading data from third-party sites. The response to an XHR request can be any type of document:    XML documents  historically    HTML chunks  quite common    JSON data  lightweight and convenient    Simple text files and others  192  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns  With JSONP the data is most often JSON wrapped in a function call, where the function name is provided with the request.   An example JSONP request URL would commonly look like this:  http:  example.org getdata.php?callback=myHandler  getdata.php could be any type of page or script. The callback parameter specifies which JavaScript function will handle the response. The URL is then loaded into a dynamic   element, like so:  var script = document.createElement "script" ; script.src = url; document.body.appendChild script ;  The server responds with some JSON data passed as a parameter to the callback func- tion. The end result is that you’ve actually included a new script in the page, which happens to be a function call. For example:  myHandler {"hello": "world"} ;  JSONP example: Tic-tac-toe Let’s put the JSONP to work with an example—a game of tic-tac-toe, where the players are the client  the browser  and the server. Both will generate random numbers between 1 and 9, and we’ll use JSONP to get the value of the server’s turn  see Figure 8-2 . You can play the game live at http:  jspatterns.com book 8 ttt.html.  Figure 8-2. Tic-tac-toe JSONP challenge  There are two buttons: to start a new game and to get the server’s turn  the client’s turn will be automatic after a timeout :   New game   Server play   Remote Scripting  193   The board will contain nine table cells with corresponding id attributes. For example:   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ...  var ttt = {        cells played so far     played: [],  The whole game is implemented in a ttt global object:         shorthand     get: function  id  {         return document.getElementById id ;     },         handle clicks     setup: function    {         this.get 'new' .onclick = this.newGame;         this.get 'server' .onclick = this.remoteRequest;     },         clean the board     newGame: function    {         var tds = document.getElementsByTagName "td" ,             max = tds.length,             i;         for  i = 0; i < max; i += 1  {             tds[i].innerHTML = "&nbsp;";         }         ttt.played = [];     },         make a request     remoteRequest: function    {         var script = document.createElement "script" ;         script.src = "server.php?callback=ttt.serverPlay&played=" + ttt.played.join ',' ;         document.body.appendChild script ;     },         callback, server's turn to play     serverPlay: function  data  {         if  data.error  {             alert data.error ;             return;         }         data = parseInt data, 10 ;         this.played.push data ;          setTimeout function    {             ttt.clientPlay  ;         }, 300 ;    as if thinking hard  194  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns          this.get 'cell-' + data .innerHTML = ' X ';       },         client's turn to play     clientPlay: function    {         var data = 5;          if  this.played.length === 9  {             alert "Game over" ;             return;         }             keep coming up with random numbers 1-9            until one not taken cell is found         while  this.get 'cell-' + data .innerHTML !== "&nbsp;"  {             data = Math.ceil Math.random   * 9 ;         }         this.get 'cell-' + data .innerHTML = 'O';         this.played.push data ;      }  };  The object ttt maintains a list of cells played so far in ttt.played and sends them to the server, so the server can return a new number excluding the ones that were already played. If an error occurs, the server will respond with output like:  ttt.serverPlay {"error": "Error description here"} ;  As you can see, the callback in JSONP has to be a publicly and globally available func- tion, not necessarily a global, but it can be a method of a global object. If there are no errors, the server will respond with a method call like:  ttt.serverPlay 3 ;  Here 3 means that cell number 3 is the server’s random choice. In this case the data is so simple that we don’t even need the JSON format; a single value is all it takes.  Frames and Image Beacons An alternative way to do remote scripting is to use frames. With JavaScript you can create an iframe and change its src URL. The new URL can contain data and function calls that update the caller—the parent page outside the iframe. The simplest form of remote scripting is when all you need to do is to send data to the server, and you’re not expecting a response. In those cases you can create a new image and point its src to the script on the server:  new Image  .src = "http:  example.org some page.php";  This pattern is called an image beacon and is useful when you want to send data to be logged by the server, for example for collecting visitor statistics. Because you have no  Remote Scripting  195   use for a response of such a beacon, a common practice  but an antipattern  is to have the server respond with a 1×1 GIF image. A better option will be to respond with a “204 No Content” HTTP response. This means that only a header and no response body is sent back to the client.  Deploying JavaScript There are a few performance considerations when it comes to serving JavaScript. Let’s discuss  the  most  important  ones  at  a  high  level.  For  all  the  details,  check  High Performance Web Sites and Even Faster Web Sites, both published by O’Reilly.  Combining Scripts The first rule when building fast-loading pages is to have as few external components as possible, because HTTP requests are expensive. When it comes to JavaScript, that means you can speed up the page loading times significantly by combining external script files together. Let’s say your page is using the jQuery library. This is one .js file. Then you’re also using a few jQuery plugins, which also come each in a separate file. This way you can quickly end up with 4 or 5 files before you’ve written a single line. It makes sense to combine these files into one, especially given that some of them will be small in size  2 to 3 Kb  and the HTTP overhead will cost more time than the actual download. Combining the scripts simply means creating a new file and pasting the contents of each. Of course, this concatenation of files should happen only right before the code goes to production and not in development, where it will make debugging more painful. The drawbacks of combining script files are:    It’s one more step before going live, but it can easily be automated and done on  the command line, for example using cat in Linux Unix:  $ cat jquery.js jquery.quickselect.js jquery.limit.js > all.js    Losing some of the caching benefits—when you make a small change in one of the files, you invalidate the whole bundle. That’s why it’s good to have a release sched- ule for bigger projects or consider having two bundles: one that contains files that are expected to change and one “core” bundle that hardly changes at all.    You need to come up with some naming and versioning pattern for the bundle,  such as using a timestamp: all_20100426.js or a hash of the file’s content.  The drawbacks can be summed up as mainly an inconvenience, but the benefit is well worth the trouble.  196  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns   Minifying and Compressing In Chapter 2 we talked about code minification. It’s important to make the minification process also a part of your build go-live process. When you think from the user perspective, there’s no reason why they should have to download all the comments in your code, which serve no purpose for the way the application works. The  benefit  of  minification  can  be  different  depending  on  how  generously  you  use comments and white space, and also on the specific minification tools you use. But on average you would be looking at around 50% file size reduction. Serving the script file compressed is also something you should always do. It’s a simple one-time server configuration to enable gzip compression, and it gives you an instant speed up. Even if you’re using a shared hosting provider that doesn’t give you much freedom  in  terms  of  server  configuration,  most  providers  at  least  allow  you  to  use Apache’s .htaccess configuration files. So in your web root, add this to the .htaccess file:  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text html text css text plain text xml  application javascript application json  Compression will give you 70% smaller files on average. Combining compression with minification, you can expect your users to download a mere 15% of the file size of unminified, uncompressed source code you wrote.  Expires Header Contrary to the popular belief, files do not get to stay for too long in the browser cache. You can do your due diligence and increase the chances of having your files in the cache for repeat visits by using an Expires header. Again, this is a one-off server configuration you can do in .htaccess:  ExpiresActive On ExpiresByType application x-javascript "access plus 10 years"  The drawback is that if you want to change the file, you also need to rename it, but you’ll probably be doing this already if you’ve established a naming convention for your bundles of combined files.  Using a CDN CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. This is a paid  sometimes quite pricey  hosting  service  that  lets  you  distribute  copies  of  your  files  in  different  data  centers around the world and have them served quicker to your users, while still keeping the same URL in your code.  Deploying JavaScript   197   Even if you don’t have a budget for CDN, you can still benefit from some free options:    Google hosts a number of popular open-source libraries, which you can link to for  free and benefit from its CDN.    Microsoft hosts jQuery and its own Ajax libraries.   Yahoo! hosts YUI library on its CDN.  Loading Strategies How you include a script in a web page seems like a straightforward question at a first glance—you use a   element and either inline the JavaScript code or link to a separate file in the src attribute:     option 1   console.log "hello world" ;      option 2     But there are some more patterns and considerations you should be aware of when your goal is building high-performance web applications. As  a  side  note,  there  are  some  common  attributes  developers  tend  to  use  with  the   element:  language="JavaScript"  In many forms of capitalizing “JavaScript” and sometimes with a version number. The language attribute shouldn’t be used, because it’s implied that the language is JavaScript. The version number doesn’t work that well and is considered a mistake in retrospect.  type="text javascript"  This attribute is required by the HTML4 and XHTML1 standards, but it shouldn’t be, because the browsers assume JavaScript anyway. HTML5 is making this at- tribute  not  required.  Other  than  satisfying  markup  validators,  there’s  no  other reason to use the type attribute.  defer   And better yet, HTML5’s async  is also a way, albeit not widely supported, to specify that downloading the external script file shouldn’t block the rest of the page. More on blocking next.  198  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns   The Place of the   Element The script elements block progressive page downloads. Browsers download several components at a time, but when they encounter an external script, they stop further downloads until the script file is downloaded, parsed, and executed. This hurts the overall page time, especially if it happens several times during a page load. To minimize the blocking effect, you can place the script element toward the end of the page, right before the closing   tag. This way there will be no other resources for the script to block. The rest of the page components will be downloaded and already engaging the user. The worst antipattern is to use separate files in the head of the document:             My App                                            ...      A better option is to combine all the files:             My App                 ...                 My App          ...             And the best option is to put the combined script at the very end of the page:  Loading Strategies   199   HTTP Chunking The HTTP protocol supports the so-called chunked encoding. It enables you to send the page in pieces. So if you have a complicated page, you don’t have to wait for all the server-side work to complete before you start sending the more or less static head of the page. One simple strategy is to send the   content of the page with the first chunk while the rest of the page is being assembled. In other words you can have something like this:  A simple improvement would be to also move the JavaScript back into the   and serve it with the first chunk. This way the browser has a head start downloading the script file while the rest of the page is not ready yet on the server side:             My App            ...                          My App                   ...                   My App                            ...              200  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns  An even better option would be to have a third chunk, which contains only the script at the very bottom of the page. You can also send a part of the body with the first chunk if you have a somewhat static header at the top of every page:       ... The full body of the page ...                      This approach fits well in the spirit of progressive enhancement and unobtrusive Java- Script. Right after the end of the second chunk of HTML you should have a completely loaded, displayed, and usable page, just as if JavaScript were disabled in the browser. Then when the JavaScript arrives with the third chunk, it enhances the page, adding all the bells and whistles.  Dynamic   Element for Nonblocking Downloads As mentioned already, JavaScript blocks the download of the files that follow it. But several patterns enable you to prevent this:    Loading the script with an XHR request and then eval   it as a string. This ap- proach suffers from same-domain restrictions and also involves eval  , which is an antipattern of itself.    Using defer and async attributes, but these don’t work across all browsers.   Using a dynamic   element.  The last one is a good and doable pattern. Similar to what you saw with JSONP, you create a new script element, set its src, and append it to the page. This is an example that will load a JavaScript file asynchronously without blocking the rest of the downloads:  var script = document.createElement "script" ; script.src = "all_20100426.js"; document.documentElement.firstChild.appendChild script ;  The drawback of this pattern is that you cannot have any other script elements that follow this pattern if they rely on the main .js being loaded. The main .js is loaded asynchronously, so there’s no guarantee when it will arrive, and the scripts that come after that might assume objects that are not yet defined. To solve this drawback you can have all the inline scripts not execute right away but be collected as functions in an array. Then when the main script arrives, it can execute all the function collected in the buffer array. So there are three steps in achieving this. First, create an array to store all inline code, as early in the page as possible:  var mynamespace = {     inline_scripts: [] };  Loading Strategies   201   Then you need to wrap all the individual inline scripts into a function and append each function to the inline_scripts array. In other words:     was:     console.log "I am inline" ;      becomes:   mynamespace.inline_scripts.push function    {     console.log "I am inline" ; } ;    And the last step is to have your main script loop through the buffer of inline scripts and execute all of them:  var i, scripts = mynamespace.inline_scripts, max = scripts.length; for  i = 0; i < max; max += 1  {     scripts[i]  ; }  Appending the   element Commonly scripts are appended to the   of the document, but you can append them to any element, including the body  as with the JSONP example . In the previous example we used documentElement to append to the  , because documentElement is the   and its first child is the  :  document.documentElement.firstChild.appendChild script ;  This is also commonly written as:  document.getElementsByTagName "head" [0].appendChild script ;  This is fine when you control the markup, but what if you’re creating a widget or an ad and you have no idea what type of page will host it? Technically you may have no   and no   on the page; although document.body will most certainly work even without a   tag:  document.body.appendChild script ;  But there’s actually one tag that will always exist on the page where your script is run— a script tag. If there were no script tag  for an inline or external file , then your code would not run. To use that fact you can insertBefore   the first available script element on the page:  var first_script = document.getElementsByTagName 'script' [0]; first_script.parentNode.insertBefore script, first_script ;  Here  first_script  is  the  script  element  that’s  guaranteed  to  be  on  the  page  and script is the new script element you create.  202  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns   Lazy-Loading The technique known as lazy-loading refers to loading an external file after the page load event. It’s often beneficial to split a large bundle of code into two parts:    One part that is required for the page to initialize and attach event handlers to the  UI elements    A second part that is only needed after user interaction or other conditions  The goal is to load the page progressively and give the use something to work with as soon  as  possible.  Then  the  rest  can  be  loaded  in  the  background  while  the  user  is engaged and looking around the page. The way to load the second part of the JavaScript is again to simply use a dynamic script element appended to the head or the body:    ... The full body of the page ...                 window.onload = function    {       var script = document.createElement "script" ;       script.src = "all_lazy_20100426.js";       document.documentElement.firstChild.appendChild script ;   };            For many applications, the lazy part of the code will most often be bigger than the core part, because the interesting “action”  such as drag and drop, XHR, and animations  happens only after the user initiates it.  Loading on Demand The previous pattern loaded additional JavaScript unconditionally after page load, as- suming that the code will likely be needed. But can we do better and load only parts of the code and only the parts that are really needed? Imagine you have a sidebar on the page with different tabs. Clicking on a tab makes an XHR request to get content, updates the tab content, and animates the update fading the color. And what if this is the only place on the page you need your XHR and ani- mation libraries, and what if the user never clicks on a tab? Enter the load-on-demand pattern. You can create a require   function or method that takes a filename of a script to be loaded and a callback function to be executed when the additional script is loaded.  Loading Strategies   203   The require   function can be used like so:  require "extra.js", function    {     functionDefinedInExtraJS  ; } ;  Let’s see how you can implement such a function. Requesting the additional script is straightforward—you just follow the dynamic   element pattern. Figuring out when the script is loaded is a little trickier due to the browser differences:  function require file, callback  {      var script = document.getElementsByTagName 'script' [0],         newjs = document.createElement 'script' ;         IE     newjs.onreadystatechange = function    {         if  newjs.readyState === 'loaded'  newjs.readyState === 'complete'  {             newjs.onreadystatechange = null;             callback  ;         }     };         others     newjs.onload = function    {         callback  ;     };      newjs.src = file;     script.parentNode.insertBefore newjs, script ; }  A few comments on this implementation:    In  IE  you  subscribe  to  the  readystatechange  event  and  look  for  a  readyState  “loaded” or “complete.” All other browsers will ignore this.    In  Firefox,  Safari,  and  Opera,  you  subscribe  to  the  load  event  via  the  onload  property.    This approach doesn’t work in Safari 2. If this browser is a requirement, to make it work there you’ll have to set up an interval to periodically check if a specified variable  which you define in the additional file  has been defined. When it becomes defined, it means the new script has been loaded and executed.  You can test this implementation by creating an artificially delayed script  to simulate network latency , called ondemand.js.php, for example:  <?php header 'Content-Type: application javascript' ; sleep 1 ; ?> function extraFunction logthis  {     console.log 'loaded and executed' ;     console.log logthis ; }  204  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns   Now testing the require   function:  require 'ondemand.js.php', function    {     extraFunction 'loaded from the parent page' ;     document.body.appendChild document.createTextNode 'done!'  ; } ;  This snippet will write two lines to the console and update the page saying “done!” You can see the live example at http:  jspatterns.com book 7 ondemand.html.  Preloading JavaScript In the lazy-loading pattern and the on-demand pattern, we post-load scripts required by the current page. In addition, you can also post-load scripts that are not needed on the current page but on the page that is likely to follow. This way, when the user lands on the second page, the user already has the script preloaded, and the overall experience becomes much faster. Preloading can be implemented simply by using the dynamic script pattern. But this means that the script will be parsed and executed. Although parsing merely adds to the total time spent in preloading, the execution can additionally cause JavaScript errors when the preloaded script assumes it’s running on the second page and, for example, expects to find certain DOM nodes. It is possible to load scripts without parsing and executing them; this works for CSS and images, too. In IE you can make a request with the familiar image beacon pattern:  new Image  .src = "preloadme.js";  In all other browsers you can use an   instead of a script element and set its data attribute to point to the URL of the script:  var obj = document.createElement 'object' ; obj.data = "preloadme.js"; document.body.appendChild obj ;  To  prevent  the  object  from  being  visible,  you  should  also  set  its  width  and  height attributes to 0. You can create a general-purpose preload   function or method and also use the init- time branching pattern  Chapter 4  to handle the browser differences:  var preload; if   *@cc_on!@* false  {    IE sniffing with conditional comments     preload = function  file  {         new Image  .src = file;     }; } else {     preload = function  file  {         var obj = document.createElement 'object' ,             body = document.body;  Loading Strategies   205           obj.width = 0;         obj.height = 0;         obj.data = file;         body.appendChild obj ;     }; }  Using the new function:  preload 'my_web_worker.js' ;  The drawback of this pattern is the presence of user agent sniffing, but it cannot be avoided because, in this case, the capability detection doesn’t tell us enough about the browser  behavior.  In  this  pattern,  for  example,  theoretically  you  can  test  if  typeof Image is a “function” and use that instead of the sniffing. However this won’t help here, because all browsers support new Image  ; it’s just that some have a separate cache for images, which means that preloading components as an image will not be used as a script from the cache on the second page but will be downloaded again.  Browser sniffing using conditional comments is interesting in itself. It is slightly safer than looking for strings in navigator.userAgent, because these strings are easy to change by the user.  Having this:  var isIE =  *@cc_on!@* false;  will set isIE to false in all browsers  because they ignore the comment , but it will be true in Internet Explorer, because of the negation ! in the conditional comment. It’s as if IE sees:  var isIE = !false;    true  The preloading pattern can be used for all kinds of components, not only scripts. It’s useful, for example, on login pages. When the user starts typing his or her username, you can use this typing time to start preloading  nothing sensitive, of course , because it’s likely that the user will end up on the second logged-in page.  Summary Whereas the previous chapters in the book covered mostly JavaScript core patterns, independent of the environment, this one focused on patterns applicable only in the client-side browser environment. We looked at:    The  ideas  of  separation  of  concerns   HTML:  content,  CSS:  presentation,  Java- Script: behavior , unobtrusive JavaScript, and capability detection versus browser sniffing.  Although toward the end of the chapter you learned how to break this pattern.   206  Chapter 8: DOM and Browser Patterns     DOM scripting—patterns to speed up DOM access and manipulation, mainly by batching DOM operations together because touching the DOM always comes at a cost.    Events, cross-browser event handling, and using event delegation to reduce the  number of event listeners and improve performance.    Two patterns for handling cases of long-running heavy computations—using set Timeout   to break long operations into smaller chunks and using web workers in modern browsers.    Various  patterns  for  remote  scripting  and  communication  between  server  and  client—XHR, JSONP, frames and image beacons.    Steps to deploy JavaScript in production environment—making sure the scripts are combined into fewer files, minified and gzipped  85% total savings , and ideally hosted on a CDN and sent with Expires header to improve caching.    Patterns for including the scripts on a page for best performance, including: various places to put the   element, while also benefiting from HTTP chunking. Also in order to reduce the initial “hit” of loading a big script we looked at various patterns such as lazy-loading, preloading, and on-demand loading JavaScript.

Colophon The animal on the cover of JavaScript Patterns is a European partridge  Perdix per- dix , also called a gray partridge, English partridge, Hungarian partridge, or Bohemian partridge. This widespread bird is native to Europe and western Asia, but it has been introduced in North America and is now common in some parts of southern Canada and the northern United States. Partridges are members of the pheasant family, Phasianidae. They are nonmigratory ground-nesters that eat mainly grain and seeds. Originally residents of grasslands, they became adapted to and spread with human agriculture; they are now most often found near cultivated fields. European partridges are rotund, chicken-like birds  about 12 inches long  with short necks and tails. They have brown backs, gray underparts  with a dark chestnut belly patch , rusty faces, and dull bills and legs. Their clutches, consisting of 15 to 20 eggs, are among the largest of any bird. Widely introduced as gamebirds, partridges were extensively hunted in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The bird’s scientific name comes from Perdix of Greek mythology, the nephew of the inventor Daedalus. Daedalus was jealous of his young student—credited with having invented the saw, the chisel, the geometric compass, and the potter’s wheel—and seized an opportunity to shove him off of the Acropolis. Athena, sympathetic to the clever boy, came to his rescue and turned him into a partridge, a bird that avoids heights and prefers to nest on the ground.

What's the best approach for developing an application with JavaScript? This book helps you answer that question with numerous JavaScript coding patterns and best practices. If you're an experienced developer looking to solve problems related to objects, functions, inheritance, and other language-specific categories, the abstractions and code templates in this guide are ideal -- whether you're writing a client-side, server-side, or desktop application with JavaScript. Author Stoyan Stefanov includes several examples for each pattern as well as practical advice for implementing them
