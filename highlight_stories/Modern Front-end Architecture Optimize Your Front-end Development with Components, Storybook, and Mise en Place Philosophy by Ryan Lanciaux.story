I’m super appreciative of the developer community in Ann Arbor, MI,   and Toledo, OH. While we’re not currently meeting in person due to a  global pandemic, it’s great to have a developer community to learn from  and discuss ideas with.  Also, I’d like to thank Scott Sanzenbacher and Steven Cramer  for helping me solidify my thinking on building applications with  components. Through discussion, debate, and seeing things succeed  or fail in real applications, their insight was instrumental to my current  development processes.  Lastly, I’d like to thank the maintainers of React, Storybook, Cypress,  Testing Library, and all of the other great open source tools that make the  craft of developing software a lot easier and more fun.  xiii   CHAPTER 1  The Mise en Place  Philosophy  There is nothing quite like the feeling of creating something that didn’t  exist before.  Whenever someone unfamiliar with coding asks me about why I am   interested in software development, I like to talk about my love for creating  things. While writing code, you can create your own worlds and build  things that didn’t exist previously.  The questioner may gloss over this response and see coding as an   exercise in tedious algorithms, equations, and syntax. To those who write  code and enjoy it, however, I would argue that this is a relatable mindset.  As opposed to software, many industries have years of standards,   structure, and guidelines. Some may question if these principles help in  the creation process. In most cases, they are both necessary and offer a  head start. It would be tragic if someone in the construction industry threw  out years of physics and structural engineering concepts to start with a  “blank slate,” so to speak. I wouldn’t want to go to a dentist who performed  creative root canals.  Think of the medical and aerospace industries. In both industries,  the pace at which they are moving today is staggering. These fields are  achieving great things by applying novel concepts to principles that have  been around for decades. To start anything completely from scratch would  be a terrible mistake.    Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R. Lanciaux, Modern Front-end Architecture, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6625-0_1  1   Chapter 1    the Mise en plaCe philosophy   Software Is Different, Right? Compared to many fields, software seems different. Software development,  as a profession, is a very young field. Many developers are familiar with  concepts like SOLID and design patterns from the Gang of Four. While  helpful, these philosophies only go back several generations, not hundreds  or thousands of years, as is the case in many other industries.  This relative “newness” of software development can be both freeing   and problematic, especially in front-end development! Time and time  again, a project that started off fun and exciting to work on turns into a  nightmare after years of development. We often rewrite our applications  only to find ourselves in the same situation a couple of years later. As we  progress through this book, we’ll discuss some strategies we can employ to  keep our software both fun to work on and maintainable.   Good Software Merely mentioning “good” software can cause fights among the developer  population of the Internet. Many developers have some opinion of what  good software is. While each person’s opinion may be different, there is an  ideal that we often don’t live up to.  We  build  our  computers  [systems]  the  way  we  build  our    cities—over time, without a plan, on top of ruins.  —Ellen Ullman, programmer and author  At various points in my career, I’ve encountered software built like the   proverbial city previously described. In these systems, you could see the  reign of different CTOs in the company. You could tell when frameworks  were popular and when they fell out of favor. It was clear where developers   2   Chapter 1    the Mise en plaCe philosophy  gave up attempts to maintain any level of consistency and just tried to  get something accomplished. These shortcomings ultimately led to  applications being rewritten, only to start the process over again.  Have you ever     Found code with the exact same functionality sprinkled   throughout a codebase?     Updated styles for one part of an application only to   find out that you broke an entirely separate part of the  application?     Been on a team that found the challenges of   maintaining a codebase so overwhelming that it  warranted a rewrite?  Bonus question: Did the rewrite  solve all the problems that were encountered?   I don’t know about you, but I can answer “yes” to all of the preceding   questions. The sad thing about these responses is that things don’t need to  be this way. Few areas in the history of software prepare us for the constant  change that besieges most front-end development teams. Thankfully, we  can leverage ideas from other industries to write better software.  You don’t have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas  from all these disciplines.  —Charlie Munger, investor  There are many industries that we, software developers, can obtain   inspiration from, but one I particularly like is the culinary world—mise en  place.  For generations, chefs tout the French term mise en place as a mindset  that is critical to success in the kitchen. “What is mise en place?” you might  ask. According to Wikipedia, mise en place means “everything in its place.”  3   Chapter 1    the Mise en plaCe philosophy  In many cases, a mise en place could refer to the setup that one takes   before actually cooking a dish. This setup might look like organizing a  workspace, chopping vegetables and other ingredients, and measuring  seasonings, sauces, and other elements. When this workflow is in place,  the final act of preparing a dish can consist of composing parts of the  previous steps.  In some restaurants, the mise en place philosophy is so trusted that   working with an entirely new kitchen staff is not seen as an impediment to  success.  We’ll see as we progress through this book that there are other parts to   the mise en place philosophy we can use in software. For now, however,  this focus on organization is where we’ll start.  While constant staffing turbulence is to be avoided, it would be   excellent to have this sort of resiliency in front-end applications.   What Does This Have to Do with Software? You might be thinking, “Okay, this is neat, but what does this have to do  with creating things outside the kitchen?” Adam Savage, the famed cohost  of MythBusters and renowned crafter maker, is a fan of the mise en place  philosophy. He dedicates a whole chapter of his book to this concept. He  describes the value of this philosophy outside the kitchen this way:  For  all  the  alchemy  that  goes  into  building  something,  the  magic of making is only possible because of the many repetitive  processes we endure in preparation for final assembly.  —Adam Savage  In other words, a great outcome is only possible because of the little   steps we take to build something.  4   Chapter 1    the Mise en plaCe philosophy  In software development, there are many repetitive processes that we   undertake. These processes may not always seem like they are helping  us prepare for a great outcome, but with attention to detail and a focus  on the individual aspects of an application, we can achieve great results.  One such way we can focus on aspects of our application individually is by  effectively leveraging components.   Components We’re in an exciting time for front-end development. Today’s frameworks  and libraries offer functionality that those developing front-end  applications even five years ago could only dream of. Despite a lot of the  new, fancy features that we get from today’s libraries, the most significant  impact is this convergence around components. Components are a central  concept to Angular, Vue, React, Svelte, and others. Most browsers even  support native web components!  Components let us break down our applications into what seems like a  series of smaller applications. Frameworks like React provide an interface  or contract that allows developers to compose components into other  components. We can craft pages or screens out of a series of components.  Let’s take a look at a product search mockup shown in Figure 1-1.  5   Chapter 1    the Mise en plaCe philosophy  Figure 1-1.  A mockup of an online coffee retailer product search  How do you imagine we would structure this product search? Do you  visualize this mockup as a single page, or perhaps you see it as a series of  components?  There’s no wrong answer here, but in many cases, we could break this   down into a product search input and search results. Continuing on this  path, we could deconstruct these components to fields  the input and  input label , buttons, photos, heading, text display, and links, as shown in  Figure 1-2.  6   Chapter 1    the Mise en plaCe philosophy  Figure 1-2.  Foundational components  As ingredients in cooking can be used in other dishes, these   components can be used as part of other screens.  This component concept that is foundational to many of today’s   front-end frameworks is great. Unfortunately, using components to build  applications and using components effectively are not one and the same.   Meetings Don’t Ensure Success  Earlier in my career, I was a front-end developer at an organization  that had multiple teams working against a single codebase. Each team  was responsible for its own part of the application. There should be no  indication to someone using this application that they were switching into  another team’s domain.  7   Chapter 1    the Mise en plaCe philosophy  A major challenge was making sure the teams were aligned and   using similar components that looked the same. Every couple of weeks,  some developers from these teams would meet to discuss the challenges  and successes that their teams had. At almost every meeting someone  would speak up, “We made a great component that solves this problem.”  Someone else would speak up, “Our team made one of these also.” In some  cases, it turned out that we had four instances of a component that served  the same purpose!  This meeting was great to align on common, future goals, but it didn’t   help achieve this necessary consistency. There had to be a better way to  not only make applications from a series of components but communicate  what components exist.   The Workspace  In commercial kitchens, this mise en place philosophy is what promotes  making consistent meals quickly. In many restaurants, there are different  stations for a variety of elements of a meal. There could be stations for  chopping vegetables, stations for cooking meat, stations for operating  grilled items, and so forth. Pieces cooked in these various stations  are composed together, transforming them into the meals served to  customers.  If you’re building web applications with components, you should  consider adding a component workspace. This workspace highlights  the components rather than standard application logic. A component  workspace is a separate web application that you can run in development  instead of your web application.  8   Chapter 1    the Mise en plaCe philosophy  Building components in isolation has numerous benefits, but there are   several key things to keep in mind:     Using a component workspace can help us write   truly reusable components. It’s easy to have tunnel  vision while working on a component as part of a  page. Instead of thinking about the responsibilities of  the page, we can focus on the responsibilities of the  component.     Focusing on one component at a time helps us ensure   the quality of the component we are building. Like a  chef in a kitchen taste testing individual parts of a meal  to ensure a stellar outcome, high-quality components  lead to better applications.     A component workspace can communicate with   other developers, designers, and stakeholders  which elements are available in a system. This  communication helps us avoid scenarios where  components are duplicated simply because others were  not aware that they existed.   Storybook In this book, we will use Storybook as our component workspace.  Storybook is an open source project to assist in building component  libraries. While there are other ways to build component libraries and  many great tools, Storybook has a mature developer ecosystem and is a  solid choice.  In the next few chapters, we’ll start coding with Storybook and React,   but for now, let’s take a quick look at what Storybook is in Figure 1-3.  9   Chapter 1    the Mise en plaCe philosophy  Figure 1-3.  Storybook inside a sample project  Using Storybook, we interact with our workspace through stories.   Stories are visual representations of a component in a specific state. By default, we see our stories in a treelist view with all available   component stories on the left and the workspace on the right. Selecting a  different story from the treelist changes the component that’s available in  the workspace. Typically, we will configure our application to run with a  script for launching Storybook by itself. This may look something like npm  run storybook or yarn storybook.  In the next chapter, we’ll begin adding Storybook to a project and   continue to see some of the benefits that this tool unlocks in our codebase.   Key Takeaways In this chapter, we talked about some of the challenges that we encounter  in the front end today. Consistency, communication, and developer  productivity can be hard to achieve in a large codebase.  10   Chapter 1    the Mise en plaCe philosophy  Other industries have strategies for organization and systems in place   to help achieve consistency and quality in an efficient way.  Mise en place is one such strategy that is used in the culinary world   that we can use in software development. Mise en place refers to the  organization and preparation that goes on prior to assembling a meal.  A workspace is an integral part of mise en place in commercial   kitchens. We can think of “mise en place” as both the architecture and  organization we apply to our codebase. Developers can benefit from a  workspace to help focus on parts of the codebase in isolation.  Storybook is an excellent tool that serves as a workspace for our code.  11   CHAPTER 2  Configuring Our  Workspace  Now that we understand a bit more about the mise en place philosophy we  want to emulate, let’s move on to the code. In this chapter, we’re going to  ensure our computer is set up and configured for our success.   System Requirements Before we embark on our adventure, let’s ensure that we have a great  JavaScript environment at our fingertips. We’ll walk through operating  system–level details in the following, but from a high level, our  requirements are     Node.js version 8 or higher – In this book, we’re going   to assume you’re using v10.     An editor you feel comfortable using for working  with JavaScript files – Visual Studio Code  https:   code.visualstudio.com  is a solid choice, but any  editor should work. This editor is a great choice  because it works on many operating systems, has a  great set of plugins, and has a large number of users.    Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R. Lanciaux, Modern Front-end Architecture, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6625-0_2  13   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  Note  You should consider only using even-numbered major  versions of Node.js for production applications. According to the  Node.js documentation, even-numbered major releases have long- term support, or they will receive bug fixes for 30 months. Odd- numbered releases only have six months of support  https:   nodejs.org en about releases  .  Even though we are not working with Node.js directly, the tools and   libraries that we’ll be using, such as npm  a CLI tool for managing installed  Node packages  and Create React App  CRA , depend on Node.js.   Installing Node.js Today, Node.js comes preloaded on many computers and operating  systems. Unfortunately, depending on a system-wide Node.js version can  cause trouble as many codebases depend on a particular version of Node.js.  What happens if we are working on several applications where each   expects a different version of Node.js? How do we know we update Node.js   for one of our projects without changing all of our codebases? These  questions may seem like hard problems to solve. Thankfully, version  managers make this a nonissue.   Version Managers  A version manager is a software that allows us to install and manage  many Node.js installations on our computer. This software will enable us  to easily use one version of Node.js in one application and a completely  different version in another. We are going to use nvm  https:  github. com nvm- sh nvm  on Mac Linux and nvm-windows   https:  github. com coreybutler nvm- windows  on Windows to achieve version  management excellence.  14   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  Note  While the names of the projects Node Version Manager  NVM   and Node Version Manager for Windows are similar, they are entirely  separate projects that have a similar purpose.  Throughout the next several sections, we will walk through how to  configure our device to run Node.js. Feel free to jump to the operating  system you use and skip all the rest.   Windows Installation Instructions As noted previously, we’re going to use nvm-windows to manage Node.js  versions on our device. We’ll start out by opening the Command Prompt.  From the Start menu, type cmd and open the Command Prompt, as shown  in Figure 2-1.  Figure 2-1.  Command Prompt application  15    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe ChApter 2   Confirming Node Version We want to ensure that we don’t have any existing versions of Node.js  installed. We can check this from the Command Prompt by typing node -v.  This command will show the version of Node.js that is installed on our  device or confirm that Node.js is not present. For instance, the following is  what it looks like if Node.js is currently installed:  > node -v v10.20.1  whereas a device without Node.js appears as  > node 'node' is not recognized as an internal or external command,  operable program or batch file.  If we see a version listed, it means we currently have Node.js installed   and should remove it before proceeding with a version manager.   Removing Existing Node.js Installations   Windows   Caution  proceed with careful consideration before applying these  changes. thoughtfully evaluate the impact these changes could  have on your device. While these instructions work for me and  countless others, you are making changes to the software that other  applications on your system may depend on. this operation may be  unnecessary depending on the version of Node.js you have on your  computer.  16   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  We’ll start off by navigating to Apps & features in Windows Settings to   remove the installed Node.js runtime. Click Node.js and select Remove.  Figure 2-2.  The Apps & features window  Next, we’ll ensure that Node.js is removed by opening the Command   Prompt again and typing node -v. Upon typing node, we should be  presented with the message that node is not recognized as a command:  > node 'node' is not recognized as an internal or external command,  operable program or batch file.  We’re now ready to install nvm-windows.   Install nvm-windows NVM for Windows is a Node.js version manager software running on  the Microsoft Windows operating system. Navigate to the Node Version  Manager for Windows project on GitHub available at https:  github. com coreybutler nvm- windows and download the latest nvm-windows  installer  https:  github.com coreybutler nvm- windows releases .  Once downloaded, we can run the installer using the default settings.  17   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  Figure 2-3.  The NVM for Windows installation wizard  Once the installation is complete, we are ready to install Node.js.   Installing Node.js  Windows  We’re going to use the command line once again. From the Start menu,  type cmd. Right-click the Command Prompt app  Figure 2-4  listing and  select “Run as administrator.” Node Version Manager requires running as  an admin.  18   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  Figure 2-4.  Start the Command Prompt as an administrator  Once we’re in the Command Prompt, type “nvm.” If everything is   installed as expected, we should see the version of nvm followed by a list of  usage instructions:  > nvm Running version 1.1.7.  From here, we’re ready to turn nvm on and install a version of Node.js:  > nvm install 10.20.1 Downloading node.js version 10.20.1  64-bit ... ... Installation complete. If you want to use this version, type nvm use 10.20.1  Now, if we run nvm on, nvm will use the version of Node.js we just   > nvm on nvm enabled Now using node v10.20.1  64-bit   installed:  > node -v v10.20.1  19   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  Node.js is now configured and running on our Windows computer.   Feel free to skip the following section on how to configure a Mac or Linux  device.   Mac Linux Installation Instructions If you skimmed through the Windows installation instructions, you may  have noticed that there were quite a few steps to install a Node.js version  manager on Microsoft’s platform. On Mac and most Linux devices, the  installation instructions are much simpler. Following along with the  nvm project’s documentation, we can install nvm on our machine by  downloading and running an install script. Launch the terminal you use  and run the following command:  curl -o- https:  raw.githubusercontent.com nvm-sh nvm v0.35.3  install.sh  bash  This command uses curl to obtain an install script and pipes it into our  bash shell. In other words, it takes the output of the downloaded script and  runs it in bash. At the time of writing, the latest version of nvm is v0.35.3.  The referenced install command references this version. To obtain the  most up-to-date version, please view the nvm project’s documentation on  GitHub: https:  github.com nvm- sh nvm.   Verify Version Manager Installation  Mac Linux   Continuing with the project’s documented steps, we should now confirm  that our installation is a success. We should start off by either restarting our  terminal or running source ~ .bashrc  or ~ .bash_profile, ~ .zshrc, or the  file containing the shell configuration . From there, run the following:  > command -v nvm nvm  20   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  If the command output is nvm, it means that the installation was  successful. If you encounter any problems, consult the nvm project  documentation  https:  github.com nvm- sh nvm  as it contains some  excellent troubleshooting tips.   Install Node.js  Mac Linux   We can now install a version of Node.js and set it as the default version on  our system:  > nvm install v10.20.1 Downloading and installing node v10.20.1... ... Now using node v10.20.1  npm v6.14.4   Since nvm allows us to install many versions of Node.js on our   computer, it can be a good idea to set a default version. Run the following  command to set the recently installed v10.20.1 as the default Node version:  > nvm alias default v10.20.1 default -> v10.20.1  We’re all set up and ready to start creating our application.   Leveraging Node.js Built-In Utilities Now that our system is configured, we’re ready to begin creating our  application. Before we do this, however, let’s briefly discuss two built-in  tools that we will use while building our application, npm and npx. The  npx tool allows us to run any command-line library stored in the npm   21   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  registry on our device. Before npx, it was necessary to install a CLI tool  locally before using it. Let’s take a look at how we can create a React app  leveraging npx:   with npx we can create a react app quickly > npx create-react-app MyApp   previously a command line tool would need to be installed  before it could be used > npm install -g create-react-app . . . > create-react-app MyApp   Creating Our React Application We’re finally ready to start constructing the application that we’ll be  building upon throughout this book. We’re going to build a web experience  for a coffee and tea shop—we’ll call it Rocket Coffee.  Most applications have humble beginnings, and ours is no different.  Right now, we simply want to build something that is basically a “Hello  World.” While there are many ways to build a React application, we’re  going to stick with the “Create React App” tool released by the React team  at Facebook  https:  create- react- app.dev  .  We’ll start by running the npx command to create our application. This   will handle all of the setup steps that we need to build a React application:  > npx create-react-app rocket-coffee . . . Happy Hacking!  This command initialized a new React app. This command took   the steps of creating a new Node.js package, installing the default  dependencies, and providing a starting point for our application. We can  now run our basic application and see it in action.  22   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe   Running the Application To run the application, we’ll navigate to our newly created directory,  “rocket-coffee,” and run the script that starts our application. In the root  of our app directory is a package.json file that contains the listing of  dependencies, scripts, and other information about our application:  > cd rocket-coffee > npm run start  Once the application is running, we should be able to navigate to   http:  localhost:3000 to see the default React application as seen in  Figure 2-5.  Figure 2-5.  The default output of the Create React App application  running in a browser  23   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  Fantastic! Our application environment is now fully operational.   Before we get started on the app-level features, let’s add our component  workspace.   Adding Our Workspace Now that we have our dependencies in place and a working “Hello  World”–style application, we should add a component workspace. As we  discussed in Chapter 1, a component workspace can be an incredible asset  in creating excellent software as opposed to building components directly  within the pages where they live.  This component workspace should be a little bit like the different   stations in a restaurant where culinary artists build the elements of a dish.  Similarly, our component workspace will be where we focus on individual  elements of a page screen.   Storybook Storybook is an excellent tool for building component libraries. This tool  is organized around the concept of stories. A story represents a unique  state of a component. A quick look at an example Storybook is seen in  Figure 2- 6.  24   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  Figure 2-6.  Example Storybook implementation  from the Storybook  Examples   Let’s break this down a bit. On the right-hand side of Figure 2-6, we see  the visual output of the story. Each component can have many stories, but  in this example, we only have one.  On the left hand, we see a listing of all possible stories, organized in a  tree view. We can change the active story by selecting a different item in  this tree view.   Installing Storybook From the terminal within our project directory, we’ll run the following to  install Storybook in our application:  > npx -p @storybook cli sb init  25   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  This command will analyze our codebase, install Storybook, and add  some scripts to our package.json file to make it easy to run the tool. Let’s  run Storybook from the command line now:  > npm run storybook  After this command completes, we should see the default example   Storybook stories  Figure 2-7 .  Figure 2-7.  Default example Storybook stories  In the next several chapters, we’ll begin to leverage Storybook to help us   build well-structured, component-based applications. For now, however,  take some time to explore the out-of-the-box Storybook experience.   Key Takeaways This chapter was all about preparation. In many cases, using a system-  wide version of Node.js can cause problems that we would like to avoid.  We installed Node.js through a version manager that won’t tie us to a  particular version of the framework.  26   ChApter 2    CONfiguriNg Our WOrkspACe  We created a React application through Create React App and   initialized a default Storybook component workspace. Although preparing  a codebase may not be as fun as writing the code that powers our  applications, it is an integral step in obtaining a great outcome.  Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.  —Alexander Graham Bell  27   CHAPTER 3  Our First Storybook  Stories  Now that the system configuration is complete and you’ve created  an application and added Storybook, we’ll dive into creating our  real Storybook stories and components that serve as the basis of our  application. In this chapter, we’re going to dive into the code a bit more.  Feel free to follow the steps we’re taking directly, or navigate to github. com ryanlanciaux example- rocket- coffee and view the code on the  branch labeled chapter3.  We are going to create an ecommerce store for a coffee tea shop called   Rocket Coffee. We’ll pretend our designer gave us some designs to work  with but not much direction outside of that. Let’s take a look at the product  listing in Figure 3-1.    Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R. Lanciaux, Modern Front-end Architecture, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6625-0_3  29   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  Figure 3-1.  Home page design  We don’t want to tackle this entire page at once. For now, we’re going   to focus on building a component for a single product item  Figure 3-2 .  30   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  Figure 3-2.  Product item  We’ll continue with the React app we started in Chapter 2. Let’s start   off by creating a new folder under src called components. From there, we’ll  add a folder called ProductListItem with two JavaScript files, index.js and  ProductListItem.js. We should end up with something like in Figure 3- 3.   You may notice that we’re capitalizing the folders and filenames for  components but using standard pascalCase for other types of files.  Figure 3-3.  Folder file structure  31   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  With our file and folder structure in place, we’re ready to start adding   some code. We’ll begin by adding what amounts to the component  equivalent of a “Hello World” application to ensure that we have everything  wired up properly:     ProductListItem.js import React from 'react';  export default function ProductListItem   {   return  Hello from Product List Item!  }     index.js export { default } from '. ProductListItem';  Note  We could place all our code inside the index.js file and avoid  creating what’s basically a pass-through file. i’ve often found that  storing my code with a very specific filename helps me find that code  later. While a well-structured application will be broken down into  concise folders, creating a separate file for your component can help  you avoid getting lost in a sea of index.js files.   Our First Storybook Stories We’re now ready to see these new components in action. Instead of  updating our application screens to include the components while we’re  actively developing them, we’re going to add a story to serve as our  workspace.  There are a couple of ways that we can create Storybook stories. Each   has its own benefits and trade-offs. In the following examples, we’ll end  up with a Storybook workspace that looks like the image in Figure 3-4   32   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  after running npm run storybook  or yarn storybook  from the command  line. We will create a story for the ProductListItem  src components  ProductListItem ProductListItem.stories.js. You might have noticed that  there is a global stories folder that’s created when we install Storybook.  Some teams prefer to place their stories in a folder outside the main src  directory. We will place our stories next to the components they represent  instead of this global stories folder. This is a personal team preference  item for discussion, but I often find that it’s easier to navigate stories when  they are near the components they describe.  Figure 3-4.  First ProductListItem story   StoriesOf The StoriesOf API is the original way to create stories in Storybook.  StoriesOf uses a custom function, provided by Storybook, to define our  stories and render them in a structured way in our component workspace.  For our example, usage of the StoriesOf methods may look like the  following code example:  33   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  import React from 'react'; import { storiesOf } from '@storybook react'; import ProductListItem from '. ProductListItem';  storiesOf 'Product List Item', module   .add ‘standard’,    =>     The StoriesOf API is a FluentInterface or a mechanism to use method  chaining to define our stories. We supply the story group in the storiesOf  method and the subsequent stories with the chained add method. We  could continue to tack on add methods, but for right now, we’re only  representing one state of our component. We’re supplying the story  name as the first parameter followed by the story method as the second  parameter. The story method can be a standard function, but I find the  arrow functions a little more readable.   Component Story Format In 2019, the Storybook team released another strategy for creating stories  called the Component Story Format. The Component Story Format is a  succinct way to create stories using, what is mostly, idiomatic JavaScript.  While the StoriesOf API uses a custom, Storybook-specific interface to  define stories, the Component Story Format uses JavaScript objects and  functions:  import React from 'react'; import ProductListItem from '. ProductListItem';  export default { title: 'ProductListItem' };  export const standard =    =>    34   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  Using the Component Story Format, we create an object with the story   properties  or metadata  as the default export. In this case, we’ve set the  property of the story title to ProductListItem. Every named export function  will be picked up by Storybook as a story to display.  According to the documentation, this API is the recommended way   to write stories and is how we will write stories throughout the remainder  of this book. There are many great reasons for this recommendation  as we’ll see in later chapters. From a high level, stories written with the  Component Story Format are more portable and reusable in other areas of  our codebase, such as tests, which we’ll explore deeper in Chapter 6.   Component Code  Now that we’ve wired up our Storybook and ensured that the story and  our component are in sync, we’re ready to create the actual component  code. We’ll start out by thinking about what our component should do.  This ProductListItem is responsible for displaying the product name,  image, price, and a function that will be activated when a shopper clicks  “Add to Cart.” In code, we’ll translate this to the React props, the inputs that  the component receives, as name, price, image, and onAddToCart. Our  example component could look like the following code output. If you’re  not currently running Storybook, now would be a good time to run npm  run storybook  or yarn storybook .  We’ll update ProductListItem.js to the following:  import React from 'react'; import '. ProductListItem.css';  export default function ProductListItem { name, price,  imageUrl, onAddToCart }  {   return                {name}   35   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries                 {price}         Add to Cart           ; }  You may notice that we’re referencing a CSS  Cascading Style Sheets    file that doesn’t exist yet. The Storybook output should be displaying an  error noting that there’s “No such file or directory” for ProductListItem. css. Go ahead and create an empty ProductListItem.css file and check the  Storybook output for the ProductListItem story.  Next, we’ll update our story to include values for the necessary props:  import React from 'react'; import ProductListItem from '. ProductListItem';  export default { title: 'ProductListItem' }; export const standard =    =>     <ProductListItem     name="Standard Coffee"     price="2.50"     onAddToCart={   => {       console.log "CLICKED" ;     }}     imageUrl="https:  source.unsplash.com tNALoIZhqVM 200x100 "    >  ;  We’re supplying some fake values to this component as well as an   excellent coffee image that we’re pulling in from the Unsplash placeholder  image API.  Now, if we go back to Storybook, we should see something like   Figure 3-5 in the content area of the Storybook window.  36   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  Figure 3-5.  First phase of the ProductListItem output in Storybook  It looks like all the items are present, but the style doesn’t quite match   up. We’ll make this a bit better with the following CSS in our CSS file:  .card {   display: flex;   flex-direction: column;    border: 1px solid EDEDED;   padding: 8px;   max-width: 240px; }  .card button {   background-color: 0A84FF;   color: fff;   padding: 8px;   border-radius: 4px; }  .card small::before {   content: '$' }  37   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  While there are a lot of things we could improve here, this is  “good enough” styling for now. We’re creating a card style for our  ProductListItem, as well as stating that we want to arrange the component  as a column view. Finally, we’re applying some basic colors and noting  that a “$” should show up before the element that we’re using to display  prices. Our story output should look like Figure 3-6.  Figure 3-6.  Updated ProductListItem  Clicking Add to Cart should now be adding log messages with the text  “CLICKED” in the browser’s JavaScript console. This can be accessed on  Chrome by selecting “View ➤ Developer ➤ JavaScript Console” from the  browser’s file menu. While it’s useful to see that our callbacks are working,  there is a much better way to interact with our components.  38   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries   Storybook Add-ons Storybook has a series of add-ons that provide additional capabilities to  the platform. There are a couple that come preinstalled when we installed  Storybook. We’re going to use Storybook’s actions add-on to remove our  log statement in the story while still seeing when our event runs.  We’ll start by importing “@storybook addon-actions” and referencing  the “action” method instead of “console.log.” We’ll pass the label we want  to apply to the callback as the parameter to this method, “Add to cart  clicked.” When we’re done, our updated story for ProductListItem.stories.js  should look like the following  only relevant updates displayed :  ... import { action } from '@storybook addon-actions';  export const standard =    =>     <ProductListItem     ...     onAddToCart={action "Add to cart clicked" }     ...    >  ;  When we click the action, we should see a pane “Actions” at the bottom   of our Storybook window that displays a message when the “Add to Cart”  button is clicked. If additional parameters are sent with the callback, these  values will show up here as well.  39   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  Figure 3-7.   Storybook Actions output  Now, what if we want to see our component with different names,   prices, and other parameters, without hardcoding a new story for each?  This is a perfect use case for the Knobs Storybook add-on.  We’ll add Knobs to the project npm install —save-dev @storybook   addon-knobs and import and register it in .storybook main.js:  module.exports = {   stories: ['.. src ** *.stories.js'],   addons: [     '@storybook preset-create-react-app',     '@storybook addon-actions',     '@storybook addon-links',     '@storybook addon-knobs'   ], };  Next, we’ll switch back to our story, import Knobs, and register it as  a decorator in our story options. The story options object is our default  export that previously contained the story’s title. The decorators property  is an array of add-ons we wish to register with this story:  import { text, withKnobs } from '@storybook addon-knobs'; export default {  40   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries    title: 'ProductListItem',   decorators: [withKnobs]  };  Following this, we’ll want to switch out our hardcoded text props to   take advantage of the newly imported Knobs. We’ll supply a name to our  knob as well as an initial value:  export const standard =    =>     <ProductListItem     name={text "Name", "Standard Coffee" }     price={text "price", "2.50" }     onAddToCart={action "Add to cart clicked" }      imageUrl={text "imageUrl", "https:  source.unsplash.com   tNALoIZhqVM 200x100 " }     >  ;  We are only using the text knob currently, but the add-on supports   arrays, numbers, Boolean, dates, colors, and many others. Since we  changed .storybook main.js, we will need to restart our Storybook server.  Once the server is restarted, at the bottom portion of our Storybook  window, we should see the Knobs tab added to the add-ons pane.  Figure 3-8.  Storybook Knobs add-on form  41   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  Typing in this pane will update our component in real time. Knobs are   a fantastic way to interact with our components, but Storybook provides  other ways that we can see our components in different states as well.   Story Variants How should we represent different global states of our component, such as  noting that an item is sold out? In the following example, let’s assume that  we add a prop called isSoldOut to our ProductListItem component. This  prop will determine if the “Add to Cart” button is enabled, as well as what  text should be displayed inside the button:  export default function ProductListItem {   name,   price,   imageUrl,   onAddToCart,   isSoldOut }  {   return                {name}                 {price}                  {isSoldOut ? "Sold out" : "Add to Cart"}                  ; }  42   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  We could interact with this property as a Boolean knob, as we did with  our text props. While this would work, it may be clearer to highlight this as  a unique story:  export const soldOut =    =>     <ProductListItem     name={text "Name", "Standard Coffee" }     price={text "price", "2.50" }     onAddToCart={action "Add to cart clicked" }      imageUrl={text "imageUrl",  "https:  source.unsplash.com   tNALoIZhqVM 200x100 " }      isSoldOut    >  ;  Figure 3-9.  Sold out story  43   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries   When Should We Create a Story vs. a Knob?  You may have noticed that we used different techniques to change how  we’re presenting our components. The distinction between what could  be a knob vs. what warrants a new story can be a nuanced decision. While  they are conceptually the same, in other words, changing which props are  passed into a component, I generally like to use the following criteria:  Knob – For changing props that do not greatly change how a user is  interacting with a component or change the purpose of the component. Story – When the purpose of the story is impacted by the addition of  a given prop or props. In our case, we slightly changed the purpose of the  ProductListItem when we passed in the isSoldOut prop. Shoppers can no  longer purchase an item by interacting with this component—it’s purely  an indicator noting that there is an item that’s typically available but it’s  currently sold out.  One other mechanism that I use when determining when to use a   knob vs. a new story is whether or not I would like to write unit tests for a  component with the presence of given props. Any time I find it would be  helpful to test a component with specific props, it generally is an indicator  that a separate story would also be useful.   Key Takeaways In this chapter, we created our first Storybook stories and discussed the  front-end application that we’ll be working on throughout a good portion  of this book. We walked through a couple different ways that we can  construct our stories and why we’ll be using the Component Story Format  to craft our stories. Finally, we talked about how to supply variants to our  stories through Knobs and creating new stories and some reasons for  choosing one strategy over another.  44   Chapter 3    Our First stOrybOOk stOries  If you’d like to dive in a bit further, there are some ways that you can   make this ProductListItem a little more ready for production.  EXERCISE: HIGHLIGHT A PRODUCT AS ON SALE  We want to call out a product as an item we want to sell. this should be a  little bit like the issoldOut prop, but it should cause the background color to  change to e8F6FF and should add the text  On sale  after the product name.  Create a new story to represent the On sale state of the productListitem. When  complete, storybook should look like Figure 3-10.  Figure 3-10.  Sale ProductListItem  45   CHAPTER 4  Creating Reusable  Components  So far, we’ve created a product list component for our Rocket Coffee  example. While this component works, we want to start employing  strategies that ensure reusability and resiliency to change.   What Makes a Good Component? Within the front-end ecosystem, there are many opinions about how a  component should be structured. If we polled the community about how  we should structure our product list example, we might receive conflicting  suggestions. Some may say we should simply make one component for  all the product list item concerns. Others may suggest creating a new  component for every HTML element.  Either of these strategies will work, but I find there’s often nuance in   what makes a good component.   It All Comes Down to Purpose  This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing  and do it well. Write programs to work together.  —Doug McIlroy, programmer known   for proposing Unix pipelines    Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R. Lanciaux, Modern Front-end Architecture, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6625-0_4  47   Chapter 4    Creating reusable Components  I like to structure my components around purpose. Like the Unix  philosophy, components should do one thing well. A series of smaller  components working in concert can serve us better than HTML tag soup  that can plague our front-end code.  Have you ever been involved in a project where adding a feature was  challenging because it was hard to determine which div to place the new  feature in? Building components by purpose can help us clearly see how a  component is structured.  Let’s go back to our product listing that we looked at in Chapter 3. As a   refresher, our ProductListItem looks like this:  import React from 'react'; import '. ProductListItem.css'; export default function ProductListItem { name, price,  imageUrl, onAddToCart }  {   return                {name}                 {price}         Add to Cart           ; } ProductListItem.js  from Chapter 3   While this isn’t too complex, we have plans to build a larger   application. Many areas of our codebase will need ways to present content  within a consistent card, display text and headings, handle click press  interactions, and so on. With that in mind, let’s refactor this component  into a series of reusable components.  48   Chapter 4    Creating reusable Components   Additional Components We’ll start off by moving the reusable elements to be wrapped in their own  components. These will mostly be pass-through components for now— that is, we’ll simply pass props to the JSX elements. As we progress through  this book, we’ll apply some powerful functionality to these components,  taking advantage of this separation:  function Heading { children }  {   return  {children} ; } function Card { children, highlight }  {   const cardClassName = highlight ? "card sale" : "card";   return  {children} ; } function Text { children }  {   return  {children} ; } function Button { onClick, children }  {   return  {children} ; }  With this in place, we can update our existing ProductListItem:  export default function ProductListItem {   name, price, imageUrl, onAddToCart,   isSoldOut, isOnSale, }  {   return                         {name} {isOnSale && " On Sale "}          49   Chapter 4    Creating reusable Components                 {price}                  {isSoldOut ? "Sold out" : "Add to Cart"}                  ; }  You may notice that the structure is relatively close as when we were   using HTML elements in this ProductListItem component. However, we’re  mostly using components that match the purpose they serve. Assuming  we were looking at this code fresh, we’d have a pretty clear understanding  of what it was doing just based on the component structure. Instead of  needing to parse CSS classNames and make sense of the hierarchy, our  component structure gives us some pretty strong clues.  If we type npm run storybook in our terminal, Storybook should load as   it did before.  Figure 4-1.  Storybook output  50   Chapter 4    Creating reusable Components   When Should We Abstract Components? This process of removing some elements from one component into a  new component can be referred to as abstracting a component. There’s a  problem with simply creating a new component out of any element that  could be a new component. It’s important to determine when we should  create an abstraction.  Prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction.  —Sandi Metz, programmer and author  Sandi Metz offers one of my favorite quotes in all of software   development. This warning reminds us that it’s often better to duplicate  code until we know we’ll end up with an abstraction that will be valuable  to our codebase.  The primary factor I use for determining if a new component would be  useful is if there are other components in a codebase that have or will need  a component that serves the same purpose. In our simple example, we can  assume that other components built for Rocket Coffee will need a Card  component. If we aren’t sure that an element will be reused, it’s a safer bet  to wait before creating an abstraction.   Component States Many components require the ability to represent different states. It seems  reasonable that we may need to represent a state for when the product list  is loading or when loading failed. Let’s create a ProductList folder next to  the ProductListItem folder in  src components. We want to have a state for  when the component is loading and when an error has occurred. We could  represent these states with Boolean flags as follows:  51   Chapter 4    Creating reusable Components  export default function ProductList  {   isLoading, hasError, ...otherProps }  {   if isLoading  {     return  ;   }   if hasError  {     return  ;   }   return    standard output when data present }  This can work, but can lead to bugs. What happens if we are technically   in the loading state, but an error occurred? We could end up with both  isLoading and isErrored set to true. Our component should never be in a  state where it’s both loading and an error occurred. To anyone using our  application, this would look like the data is consistently loading, when  they should be presented with a note that there was an error loading the  data. While there are many ways around this, such as error boundaries and  handling errors higher up in the component hierarchy, we should strive to  ensure that our components only end up in one, accurate state.  Taking a cue from state machines and state charts, we can change our   props to take a status prop instead of several Boolean flags. According to  Smashing Magazine, “the machine can have different states, but at a given  time fulfills only one of them”  www.smashingmagazine.com 2018 01  rise- state- machines  . For our simple example, this means the state or  status of our component is either loading, loaded, or errored. It wouldn’t be  possible to be in both loading and error states at the same time as it would  with Boolean flags that control the component state.  52   Chapter 4    Creating reusable Components  Figure 4-2.  visualization of our simple state machine  With that philosophy in place, we could update our simple example.   We’ll start by adding a statusTypes object to contain our component states:  export const statusTypes = {   loading: "loading",   errored: "errored",   loaded: "loaded" };  This object contains all the states that our component can be in. These   values could be any other string, but using the same property name and  value should work well enough for most instances:  export default function ProductList { status, ...otherProps }  {   if  status === statusTypes.loading  {     return  ;   }   if  status === statusTypes.errored  {     return  ;   }    return ...    standard output when data present }  53   Chapter 4    Creating reusable Components  Next, we can create some stories to see our various component states   in action. We’ll create ProductList.stories.js.   How Should We Arrange Our Components? By default, React, the library, has very little opinion about where  components should live in our codebase. While some libraries and  frameworks are very opinionated about where things belong, React doesn’t  offer any strong recommendations. I’ve found when building a component  library, there are a couple guidelines I like to follow.   Classifying Component Types One guideline I like to follow is grouping like components together. There’s  a problem here—we don’t necessarily have a great metric to ensure that  we’re classifying components the same way.  There’s a fantastic book  https:  atomicdesign.bradfrost.com    and article  https:  bradfrost.com blog post atomic- web- design    by Brad Frost called Atomic Design. In Atomic Design, Brad describes a  mechanism for classifying UI elements based on the periodic table of  elements. In this philosophy, he references building design systems out  of components, where the lowest-level components are atoms, which  can be composed into molecules, organisms, and so on. In other words,  the foundational components, or atoms, get composed together into  bigger components, which eventually make up our application screens or  pages. I love this philosophy and find it’s a really useful way to think about  components that make up our applications.  54   Chapter 4    Creating reusable Components  That all said, I generally use a slightly different naming schema: Atoms – Inspired by the naming in Atomic Design, I generally call my  foundational components atoms. These are things like buttons, headings,  text, and things that don’t stand up so well on their own, but are necessary  for the success of the other elements in our application.  Patterns – These components are reusable UI patterns that are   composed from the atom-level components. I would classify our  ProductListItem component as a pattern, since it is composed of the Card,  Button, Heading, and Text components and can be valuable in many  contexts.  Screens – These components represent our pages or screens in an   application. A screen could be something like the product listing page that  a user would see. This could consist of a layout, product list, and various  other elements.  While this is the naming schema that I generally use right now,   it’s important to note that this is not a set of definitive rules. The more  important thing is to use consistent naming classification that works for  you or your team.  With this in mind, we can go ahead and update our ProductList.js and   ProductListItem.js to be in components patterns.  While we’re at it, we should create new folders that match the other   components we moved out of the main ProductListItem component  but  kept in the ProductListItem.js file . When we’re done, we should end up  with a file structure like this:  55   Chapter 4    Creating reusable Components  RocketCoffee  ├─ src    ├── components      ├── atoms        ├── Button        ├── Card        └── Heading      ├── patterns        ├── ProductList        └── ProductListItem   Once we restart Storybook, everything should be working, using this   structure. It should be noted that we’re only looking at the folder listing for  src right now. These folders should contain the index.js, component, and  {componentName}.stories.js files as we’ve seen with the ProductListItem:  ProductListItem          ├── index.js          ├── ProductListItem.js          └── ProductListItem.stories.js  EXERCISE: HIGHLIGHT A PRODUCT AS ON SALE  using the productlistitem folder listing as a guide, create files for the atomic  components in productlistitem.js. these components should live in the folders  we created in the preceding text under src components atoms. Feel free to  reference the Chapter 4 example code if you get stuck.  56   Chapter 4    Creating reusable Components   Key Takeaways In this chapter, we discussed how to write components that scale well.  Taking inspiration from the Unix philosophy, we built components that  focus on one thing and handle that one thing well. We talked about how  a component’s purpose should be clear and focusing on this purpose can  help illuminate what items should exist as unique components. Finally, we  talked about components as a series of states and some strategies we can  use to classify our components.  57   CHAPTER 5  Styling  In this chapter, we’re going to talk about styling front-end applications.  Styling is an exciting topic. It’s fun to see our code change how our  application looks. Unfortunately, merely mentioning CSS can cause  some developers to run away and look for any other development task  to work on. Styling applications has unique challenges that other coding  paradigms do not, but few areas of our code make quite as big of an impact  as quickly as how we style our code.  How we style our applications can be a huge topic too! There are entire   books and volumes of books dedicated to this topic, and many of these  may fall short. To make things more challenging, the front-end landscape  for styling has exploded with options lately regarding how we can style our  apps. Like anything in programming, fans of a particular paradigm will  often suggest that their preference is the best way, making it challenging to  separate useful information from hype.  Navigating the styling landscape can be challenging, but it doesn’t  have to be. In this chapter, we’re going to discuss some of the options  we have and where we may want to choose one over another. We will  mostly be focused on choosing how to style our applications and the  structure we may want to put in place to ensure our styles scale with our  applications. This chapter will not be a deep dive on the syntax of styling  our applications.    Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R. Lanciaux, Modern Front-end Architecture, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6625-0_5  59   Chapter 5    Styling   CSS Any discussion around styling web applications should start with CSS   Cascading Style Sheets . CSS is the browser-supported way to style web  applications. Using CSS, we apply attributes to HTML elements and  define the styles that should be applied to these elements by referring to  them through selectors. A selector is a way that we can refer to an HTML  element. In some cases, this can be through applying a className prop or  an id attribute to an element or finding the element through other means:     index.html            Login box here...            One     Two     Three     * index.css *  login-box {   border: 1px solid ededed;   border-radius: 5px;   ... } .points li:nth-child 2  {   background-color: ccc; }  60   Chapter 5    Styling  In the preceding example, we’re using CSS to style some HTML   elements. In the case of login-box, we’re selecting this element with an  id. Element IDs should be unique—we could use a class if we wanted to  select multiple elements by an identifier. We’re also applying a background  color to the second element in list using the nth-child pseudo class. This  allows us to select a single item by its order in a group. This example  only scratches the surface of what we can do with CSS. For a more  exhaustive exploration of CSS, you may want to look at Architecting CSS:  The Programmer’s Guide to Effective Style Sheets by Martine Dowden and  Michael Dowden.   Benefits of CSS CSS can be interpreted in just about every browser we will encounter  when developing applications. Many of the other ways we can style an  application, preprocessors and so on, require a translation or compilation  step to work in a browser. By default, CSS needs no such translation.  Additionally, while there is nuance to how different developers use CSS, it’s  a ubiquitous paradigm. Many web developers have some experience with  CSS, where a more specialized styling library may be a foreign concept.   Drawbacks of CSS This headline is intentionally misleading. When talking about the  pros and cons of different styling technologies, one of the items that  constantly comes up with CSS is cascading  the C in CSS . Cascading is the  characteristic of CSS that allows properties to overwrite other properties.  This can be confusing to some developers who aren’t aware of this  feature—especially in codebases that treat styling as an afterthought.  While the argument could definitely be made that cascading is one   of the benefits of CSS, we’re discussing it as a drawback as well, as it’s  something that those who may not be as comfortable with CSS may trip   61   Chapter 5    Styling  over as they’re styling applications. Have you ever tried to change the  styling in one area of a codebase only to find that the styles you added were  not getting applied? It’s likely that something else in your application was  overriding your styles. With CSS, the last property that’s interpreted is the  last one that is applied.  Due to how CSS selectors work, it can be easy to have naming conflicts  or misapply styles to elements we’re not intending to style. Careful naming  and code structure should be applied to help avoid conflicts.  Note  there is a technique called BeM  Block element Modifier  that  can help with element specificity and avoiding conflicts. you can learn  more about BeM at getbem.com.   Preprocessors A CSS preprocessor is, as the name implies, something that processes  different styling syntax and converts it to CSS the browser understands.  One common preprocessor is Sass. An example of Sass SCSS syntax is as  follows:  $heading-color: 00F; $text-color: 2A2A2A; .card {   width: 300px;   border-radius: 5px;   border: 1px solid EDEDED;   padding: 12px;    h3 {     color: $heading-color;   }  62   Chapter 5    Styling    p {     color: $text-color;   } }  This styling corresponds to the following HTML:       This is the heading     This is some text     At first glance, this code may seem just like CSS. Upon further   inspection, however, it may be apparent that Sass SCSS and standard  CSS are quite a bit different. Sass gives additional functionality to styling  like variables and nested element styles. This can be a solid option, but  it should be noted that CSS supports custom properties  or variables .  Additionally, as of the writing of this book, the CSS Working Group is  discussing the addition of nesting to CSS.  Note  Sass SCSS and other CSS preprocessors can add a lot of  useful functionality beyond the items discussed here. that said, the  individual features are outside the scope of this book.   Benefits of Preprocessors Preprocessors can add great functionality to CSS. Using a preprocessor  allows us to write styling code in a way that can feel closer to how we  write our application’s logic by providing additional utilities to our styling  code. Some such capabilities that preprocessors unlock are variables,  conditional statements, loops, and property nesting.  63    Styling  Chapter 5   Drawbacks of Preprocessors Preprocessors can add extra build steps that may add time or even file size  to our exported code. Additionally, the preprocessor syntax can add new  code that developers may need to learn.   CSS-in-JS Handling styles in JavaScript is potentially one of the most controversial  topics in this book. Some developers love pushing more of the front-end  responsibility into JavaScript, while others see it as a high crime.  CSS-in-JS techniques are a popular choice for many React codebases   since they push the “Everything is a component” mentality that often  comes with React. Where other frameworks promote separation of  concerns, React components layer styling, markup, and functionality as  one cohesive unit of code. Using CSS-in-JS pushes this concept a little  further as it treats styles as a responsibility of the component.  One way we can leverage CSS-in-JS is using the React component   style prop:  const Card =    => {   return       <div       style={{         backgroundColor: "EDEDED",         borderRadius: 5,         padding: 12       }}     >       ...           }  64   Chapter 5    Styling  In our preceding card example, we are supplying a background-color,  border-radius, and padding. Notice that we’re using camel case instead of  the traditional CSS property names since dashes are not valid as JavaScript  properties. Also, since this is just a JavaScript object, we could move this  style, so it’s not inline:  const cardStyle = {   backgroundColor: "EDEDED",   ... } return  <div style={cardStyle} ... ;  In addition to React’s style prop, there are other libraries in the   React ecosystem that provide mechanisms for styling such as emotion  and styled-components. Using styled-components, we can style our  application with tagged template literals and styled’s API. We’ll start off  creating a Card component:  const Card = styled.div`   width: 300px;   border-radius: 5px;   border: 1px solid EDEDED;   padding: 12px;   h3 {     color: ${ props  => props.headingColor};   }   p {     color: ${ props  => props.textColor}   } `;  65   Chapter 5    Styling  After this, we’ll supply default props. Since Card is a React component,   we will use the same API to add defaultProps as we would to any other  React component:  Finally, we can render our Card component similar to how we would   Card.defaultProps = {   headingColor: "00F",   textColor: "2A2A2A" }  any other component:  export default function App   {   return                This is a card heading         This is the text description           ; }  It’s worth repeating that this Card we created with styled-components  is a React component. The styled-components API allows us to nest styles  and even receive props! This can be an extremely powerful way to style our  React applications.  Note  We’re only scratching the surface of what we can achieve  using styled-components or emotion. Both libraries have a  mechanism for themes that provides a clear path for providing  consistent styles to varying components. additionally, there are entire  ecosystems of plugins that these libraries can utilize such as styled-  system, rebass, and theme-ui.  66   Chapter 5    Styling   Benefits of CSS-in-JS Using CSS-in-JS to style our components allows us to stick with a single  paradigm to develop and style our components. It can be incredibly useful  to style our components using the same properties that we’re using to  build our component functionality. Additionally, developers who are not  comfortable with the cascading aspects of CSS may feel more at home  using CSS-in-JS.   Drawbacks of CSS-in-JS Like preprocessors, CSS-in-JS introduces new syntax that developers need  to learn. Additionally, styling with JavaScript doesn’t necessarily take  advantage of performance benefits that we get by using raw CSS in the  browser.   Utility-First Styling Libraries In recent years, utility-first styling libraries have risen to the forefront  of app styling options, popularized by libraries such as Tailwind and  Tachyons. By using a utility-first approach, developers build many small  CSS classes or styling functions that can be used repeatedly throughout a  codebase. Instead of applying styles directly to a component, we reference  a number of utility class names to define how it is styled. Using Tailwind,  we could style a Card component like this:  A Card component using Tailwind       ...     ...     67   Chapter 5    Styling  What do you think about this approach? My first reaction upon   seeing Tailwind was negative, but having used Tailwind on some projects,  I gradually found it to be a very quick and consistent way to style UI  applications. Utility-first libraries embrace the “Do one thing well”  philosophy that we discussed in Chapter 4 and provide a nice way to build  UIs with composition.   Benefits of Utility-First Libraries Leveraging utility-first libraries allows us to quickly build consistent  UI applications. In many cases, the styles that we need to apply are  available, and utilizing the style utilities can help us ensure that all of our  components have the same look and feel.   Drawbacks of Utility-First Libraries Oftentimes, utility-first libraries still depend on CSS preprocessors to  achieve their results. This is useful because it can eliminate utilities  that aren’t used, but also adds an additional build step. What’s more,  some developers don’t like having multiple class names to determine a  component or element’s styling.   How to Choose a Styling Solution There are trade-offs we must consider when choosing any of these options.  There are many factors that come into play when choosing a method for  styling your application. Unfortunately, there is no way we can come up  with a one-size-fits-all approach to choosing how you or your team should  style your application.  What I often evaluate when recommending a styling solution is the  level of comfort a team may have with CSS vs. JavaScript. Additionally, I   68   Chapter 5    Styling  think about how a team may embrace composing class names to create  components vs. providing unique styles. Finally, I explore the build steps  that must occur to successfully use one of the techniques.  For this book, we’re going to use CSS to style our components. All of   the other options we discussed depend on CSS knowledge. The things we  learn for CSS will almost always be valuable for other libraries, while the  same may not be true of other techniques.   Building a Theme When constructing a component library, we want our components to  use consistent colors, spacing, fonts, and so on. Have you ever used an  app where you could tell a different team was responsible for a different  area of the codebase based solely on how it looked? We want to avoid this  scenario, and we’ll achieve this through the use of themes.  We’ll start by creating a CSS file that contains the custom properties   we’ll use in our app to define our global template. We’ll use :root to define  variables that apply to any element in our codebase:  :root {   --background: fff;   --text: 222;   ...   --border-default: 1px solid;   --font-sm: 12px;   --spacing-sm: 4px;   ...   --spacing-xlarge: 48px;   --shadow-default: 10px 9px 33px -17px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.75 ;   --radius-default: 8px; }  69   Chapter 5    Styling  Next, we’ll define our card styles:  .card {   background-color: var --background ;   color: var --primary ;   padding: var --spacing-medium ;   margin: var --spacing-large ;   border: var --border-default ;   border-color: var --light ;   border-radius: var --radius-default ;   box-shadow: var --shadow-default ; }  import React from "react"; import ".. .. .. theme.css"; import ".. .. .. Card.css"; export default function Card   {   return                  ...          ; }  Finally, we’re ready to use this style for our Card component:  Now that we have a pretty good handle on how we’re going to style   components in our application, let’s jump back to our Rocket Coffee  example and apply these findings there. We’ll start off by copying our  theme.css file to  src theme.css. Next, we’ll create a new file under  src  components atoms Card  called Card.css:  70   Chapter 5    Styling  .card {   background-color: var --background ;   color: var --primary ;   padding: var --spacing-medium ;   margin: var --spacing-large ;   border: var --border-default ;   border-color: var --light ;   border-radius: var --radius-default ;   box-shadow: var --shadow-default ; }  If we run Storybook or the app directly, we’ll notice that our styles are   not showing up. We need to import our theme.css file in both our main  app’s entry point and Storybook’s entry point.  For our main app, navigate to src index.js and import the following line   after the rest of the imports:  import '. theme.css'  For Storybook, navigate to the .storybook directory and add a new file,   config.js. Add the following import statement to the newly created file:  import ".. src theme.css";  Now, if we run npm run storybook, the Card with the styles based on   the theme should be present.  71   Chapter 5    Styling   Key Takeaways In this chapter, we discussed the various strategies we can use to style our  applications and some of the pros and cons of the various techniques. We  also discussed why using CSS is a solid choice for our exploration. Finally,  we talked about CSS custom properties and how we can use them to  establish themes for our application.  EXERCISE  So far, we’ve only added the styling for our Card component in rocket Coffee.  Spend some time and add styles for the rest of the items. Check to ensure that  it’s working with Storybook by running npm run storybook.  72   CHAPTER 6  Ensuring the Quality  of Our Components  So far, we’ve built our components in isolation and have tested them  for quality manually through Storybook. We’ve verified that our code is  working by running our components directly through Storybook, but there  are other techniques we may want to apply to ensure that we’re providing  a quality codebase. Can you imagine checking every component in a web  app before every release?   Unit Tests Storybook is an excellent workspace for our components. So far, it’s also  served as the primary method of ensuring our components are working  as expected. This works great for our smaller examples, but we are in  the business of creating professional applications. In these professional  applications, there are generally a lot of components in play. Testing each  thing manually will not scale as well as we would like. Thankfully, we can  automate this process through unit testing.  Unit tests are blocks of code that we can use to test a specific unit of   application code. In other words, we write code to ensure that the various  elements of our codebase are functioning as intended. This may seem odd  to write code to verify that our code functions, but creating tests can result  in code that scales better over time, with lesser bugs and higher resiliency     Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R. Lanciaux, Modern Front-end Architecture, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6625-0_6  73   ChApTeR 6    ensuRIng The QuAlITy of ouR ComponenTs  to change. Instead of manually going through all of our components and  features, we can run a test script to verify that our application is working as  intended.  JavaScript has a built-in way that we can perform unit tests:  > console.assert 1 + 3 === 7 ; Assertion failed  While this assert works, it suffers from a lack of tooling. We would have  to come up with our own way of running these tests. Thankfully, there are  many open source options that we can leverage to achieve a great testing  experience for our applications.  In our time together, we’ll use Jest to write tests. Jest is an open source   unit testing library created by Facebook. Jest serves as the tool that we  will run our tests with and provides some guidance on how we should  structure our unit test code. It balances ease of use with flexibility and has  a pretty large ecosystem of developers. This large ecosystem generally  results in more people who have encountered and fixed issues and more  plugins.  Let’s take a look at simple calculator and related Jest tests. By   default, Create React App  or CRA , the starting point we are using for  our application, comes with Jest preconfigured. We’ll proceed with the  assumption that we are using Jest under this CRA umbrella.  If you need Jest outside of Create React App, the configuration   Note  is relatively straightforward. Check out the Jest documentation for  more on that at https:  jestjs.io . The information on this site  also provides information on how to use Jest outside of React!  74   ChApTeR 6    ensuRIng The QuAlITy of ouR ComponenTs  We’ll also assume that we have a test script in our package.json file that   runs jest for us when we type npm run test from the command line:  export function add a, b  {   return a + b; }  We’re going to write a simple test and ensure that things are working   as expected. But before we check that that things are working as expected,  it can be a good practice to make sure that a scenario that should result  in a failed test actually causes a test failure. I’ve seen tests that appeared  to be working, but failed to catch a number of bugs. Examining the tests  while fixing the bugs, it turned out that the tests always passed. The tests  gave a false sense of security. To help avoid this situation, we’ll start out by  making sure that our test fails before we make it pass:  import { add } from '. calculate';  it 'adds two numbers correctly',    => {   expect add 5, 6  .toEqual 17 ; }   We’re using Jest to state that the test adds two numbers correctly. This   is described in the it method. The first parameter to the method is the  test label, or what we’ll see in the output to reference this test. The expect  method is where we will add our assertions. Jest and the testing ecosystem  provide many other extension methods, like toEqual, we can use to verify  our assertions. Additionally, we have an arrow function that performs the  test. Clearly, adding 5 to 6 does not result in 17. First, we want to ensure  that our test fails with incorrect values supplied. We make sure the test   75   ChApTeR 6    ensuRIng The QuAlITy of ouR ComponenTs  fails initially because want to avoid any scenario where our tests provide us  with false confidence. Running npm run test will result in the following  message:  adds two numbers correctly   expect received .toEqual expected     deep equality   Expected: 17   Received: 11  Excellent. As expected, the test failed as we hoped. We see the title of  the test “adds two numbers correctly” followed by the result. Now, let’s go  ahead and fix this test so it runs:  it 'adds two numbers correctly',    => {   expect add 5, 6  .toEqual 11 ; }   Jest test runner:  Test Suites:     1 passed, 1 total Tests:             1 passed, 1 total  Running npm run test again results in the following message from the   This is a great way to test standard JavaScript methods and classes, but   how would you approach testing a React component?   Testing React Components It’s true that React components are standard JavaScript methods or classes,  but there is more nuance to these components since they have the concept  of a rendering surface. On the Web, React components render to the DOM   document object model . Tests need some way to handle rendering as  well. There are many things we could do to obtain a rendering surface in  our React component tests. We’re going to focus on React Testing Library.  76   ChApTeR 6    ensuRIng The QuAlITy of ouR ComponenTs  In my opinion, React Testing Library offers an incredible testing   experience. In this paradigm, we’ll use React Testing Library to render  our components and then interact with our components using the query  methods that React Testing Library provides.  Let’s add some tests to our product listing for Rocket Coffee. We’ll start   off adding Testing Library to our project via the CLI:  npm install —save-dev @testing-library react  From there, we’ll move on to our code. We’re going to start by adding  tests to the ProductListItem.js component, located in src components  patterns ProductListItem . For our exploration, this component  has a good balance between number of features within the component  and succinctness. We can cover the items that we wish to without being  overwhelmed.  We’ll start by thinking about the things that can test. Personally, I  usually think about the branching code paths  things that show up in  one context and not another  and the items that have interaction points.  We could add more testing for ensuring things render the items we’re  expecting, but we’ll leave that as an exercise for you.  In this case, we want to test the following:     Show  On Sale  when the component is on sale.     Call onAddToCard when the button is enabled and   clicked.     Disable the button when sold out.  We’ll create a new file ProductListItem.test.js next to the   ProductListItem.js. We’ll open the test file and create our first test. Keep  in mind, we won’t need to import anything for Jest, but we will for React,  React Testing Library, and our component.  One thing that would be good to quickly discuss before we embark on   testing these components: React Testing Library has quite a few helper   77   ChApTeR 6    ensuRIng The QuAlITy of ouR ComponenTs  methods and functions that we will not be using in these examples. It  would be good to familiarize yourself a bit with the documentation at some  point, as these helper functions may save you a lot of time and debugging  heartache if you’re aware of them.  With that out of the way, let’s continue adding our tests!  it 'shows on sale label when isOnSale',    => {   const { getByText } = render <ProductListItem     name="Mocha"     price={3.50}     imageUrl="..."     isOnSale    >      expect getByText ` On Sale `         .toBeInTheDocument  ; }   Here, we are rendering our component with React Testing Library with   an isOnSale prop. We’re expecting the text “ On Sale ” to exist in the text  rendered here. If we open up our terminal and type in npm run test, we  should be presented with a note that our test passed:  Test Suites:  1 passed, 1 total Tests:          1 passed, 1 total  Note  Keep in mind it can be a good practice to ensure that the test  fails so we don’t think that the test works when it does not. Tests that  provide false security are worse than no tests.  With this test out of the way, let’s continue on. We’ll start with the   test for checking that we disable the button when the isSoldOut prop is  present:  78   ChApTeR 6    ensuRIng The QuAlITy of ouR ComponenTs  it 'disables the button when disabled',    => {   const { getByText } = render <ProductListItem     name="Mocha"     price={3.50}     isSoldOut    >    expect getByText "Sold out"       .toHaveAttribute 'disabled' ; } ;  The last test we want to add is for ensuring that clicking addToCart actually   fires an event. We’re going to use a Jest mock function. A mock function is  something that we can use while testing in place of a real function. We’ll interact  with the mock function as jest.fn. In the following example, we’re setting a value  onAddToCart to this mock function and referencing it in our component. In addition to a mock function, we’ll want to click the button in our   test to ensure that the onAddToCart method is being called. React Testing  Library has a fireEvent helper that we will use to achieve our goals:  import { render, fireEvent }   from '@testing-library react'; ...  it 'calls callback when button Add to Cart pressed',    => {   const onAddToCart = jest.fn  ;   const { getByText } = render <ProductListItem     name="Mocha"     price={3.50}     onAddToCart={onAddToCart}    >     fireEvent.click getByText "Add to Cart"     expect onAddToCart .toHaveBeenCalled   }   79   ChApTeR 6    ensuRIng The QuAlITy of ouR ComponenTs   Testing Alongside Storybook These tests may feel a little familiar. That’s because they closely resemble  our Storybook stories. In both the Storybook stories and tests, we’re  examining our component in different states. For instance, we have a  standard state, an “On Sale” state, and a “Sold out” state.  What if we could eliminate the areas where we’re defining the JSX  elements to render and leverage what we already set up for Storybook  instead? We can, and there are a couple of immediate advantages to this:     We can visually “debug” our tests. If one of our tests fails,   instead of logging out the rendered HTML  a common  debugging technique , we could fire up Storybook and  manually step through the same steps. Since the test and the  story are using the same code to determine how an element  should be rendered, we can have confidence that we’re not  out of sync between manually walking through our code and  the automated test.     We keep our stories up to date. I’ve seen many projects  where Storybook eventually became out of sync with the  current state of a product. What started as a useful tool lost its  relevance as developers became less vigilant about creating  and maintaining stories. This is a tragedy as Storybook can  provide a lot of value, but treating Storybook as part of the  testing process helps us ensure that Storybook stays up to date.      It’s less code less duplication. While duplication is a better  option when things are not the same, we want to run our  components in different states in Storybook. Similarly, we  want to test our components in various states in our unit  tests. Take our example of the ProductListItem. We have one  state of the component when the product is in stock and  another state of the component when the product is sold out.   80   ChApTeR 6    ensuRIng The QuAlITy of ouR ComponenTs  We’ll make some adjustments to our ProductListItem stories. Instead   of applying the Storybook Knobs and actions directly to our elements, we’ll  bring in the values as default parameters to the story. This way, our tests  can override properties as necessary while still providing the default add-  on values when desired:  export const Standard =  {   name=text "Name", "Standard Coffee" ,   price=text "price", "2.50" ,   onAddToCart=action "Add to cart clicked" ,   imageUrl=text        "imageUrl",       "https:  source.unsplash.com tNALoIZhqVM 200x100 "       }  =>     <ProductListItem     name={name}     price={price}     onAddToCart={onAddToCart}     imageUrl={imageUrl}    >  ;  Now, we can import these stories and use them in our test, instead of   duplicating the creation of these elements:  import { OnSale, SoldOut, Standard } from '. ProductListItem. stories'; it 'shows on sale label when isOnSale',    => {   const { getByText } = render      expect getByText ` On Sale `  .toBeInTheDocument  ; }   81   ChApTeR 6    ensuRIng The QuAlITy of ouR ComponenTs  it 'disables the button when disabled',    => {   const { getByText } = render      expect getByText "Sold out"  .toHaveAttribute 'disabled' ; } ;  it 'calls onAddToCart when button pressed',    => {   const onAddToCart = jest.fn  ;   const { getByText } = render <Standard     onAddToCart={onAddToCart}    >    fireEvent.click getByText "Add to Cart"     expect onAddToCart .toHaveBeenCalled   }   While less code isn’t the goal, especially when testing, this is a great   way to share our stories with other areas of our codebase to achieve better  software.   Key Takeaways In this chapter, we discussed ways in which we can test our components  automatically and why we may wish to do so. We discussed Jest and React  Testing Library from a high level. Finally, we talked about how we can  leverage our existing Storybook stories to power our unit tests.  EXERCISE: CREATE ADDITIONAL TESTS  so far, we’ve added tests to the productlistItem only. go through  src  components atoms and src components patterns ProductList and add tests to  the components in those folders.  Be sure to check out the included examples if you get stuck!  82   CHAPTER 7  Interacting with   API Data  So far, we’ve worked on very specific components for a small portion of  our application. In this chapter, we’re going to discuss ways that we can  promote consistency beyond simply defining where our components live.  In Chapter 4, we talked about classifying our component types and   how component classification should have some impact on where those  files live in our codebase. In addition, we discussed using atoms, patterns,  and screen or page components. Atoms are lowest-level building block  components in our system, whereas patterns are slightly more complex  reusable components. Lastly, we discussed screens; these would be the  page-level features.  Unfortunately, in very large systems, there can be a lot of space   between what we call patterns and screens. That is, so far, we’ve mostly  focused on creating components in a reusable way and not focused on  how we should glue everything together into a cohesive application. With  anything in software development, there are quite a few options at our  disposal. We’ll discuss a couple of these options and some of the trade-offs  we should consider when employing the various techniques.    Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R. Lanciaux, Modern Front-end Architecture, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6625-0_7  83   Chapter 7    InteraCtIng wIth apI Data    Some Main Considerations Several of the major considerations we need to take into account are how  we’re handling data loading, application state management, and routing  between pages.  Data loading – This part of the code refers to how we interact with   systems outside of our front-end application. This could be something like  API servers or third-party platforms.  State management – One of the trickier things we need to consider  when building applications is how we manage the application state. In  many scenarios, we’ll need to keep track of variables that are shared  between pages and components. Additionally, we need to determine how  to pass application state between various components. There could be  entire books on this topic alone, but in this book, we’ll use React’s built-in  state management.  Additionally, we’ll structure our application in such a way that our   folder hierarchy can help us determine where to place our state variables.  We’ll see this in action more as we progress through this chapter.  Routing – We link our various pages and provide entry points to our   application via the browser’s URL with routing. Our front-end applications,  much like standard static HTML documents, have paths that they respond  to from the browser bar.  We’re going to organize our system around the concept of routing.   What this means is our src components pages folder will be arranged to  match the routes that the patrons of our coffee shop will visit to purchase  coffee.  This means that for every main route, we’ll have a corresponding  folder in our pages directory and every subroute will map to a specific  subcomponent within that directory. Let’s assume that we will have a  Checkout screen in our application and the checkout process consists of  a screen where a customer will input their payment information and a   84   Chapter 7    InteraCtIng wIth apI Data   screen where they confirm their order and payment information is correct.  On this second screen is where the purchase will actually occur. Our folder  structure in our pages may look a little bit like this:  RocketCoffee _ src __ pages ____ Checkout ______ Checkout.js ______ Confirm.js ______ index.js ______ PaymentInfo.js  Our screens would then map to  checkout,  checkout paymentInfo,   and checkout confirm. A little bit later, we’ll set this up, but for now,  we’re building our mental model of how the various pieces we’re building  connect.  Now, our routing structure is established, but how do we handle   application state and data loading?   Feature-Based Development We’re going to take a cue from a technique called feature-based  development to determine where our data loading will occur. In feature-  based development, we arrange our code around features. Features  represent a unit of value in our application and encapsulate everything  that the feature may need.  Applications not embracing this paradigm will often organize files   around technology. This is especially pronounced in applications using  Redux. While we are not using Redux in our application, this example  can illuminate some of the overhead we can incur when arranging our  codebase around the technologies that are in play.  85   Chapter 7    InteraCtIng wIth apI Data   Let’s assume we are building our shopping cart functionality with  Redux. In a traditional application, there are folders for components,  pages, and the various technologies that are used with Redux, actions,  reducers, selectors, and so on. We would end up with something like this:  Product lists, user accounts, and everything else would theoretically  have files dispersed between actions, reducers, selectors, and so on. This  works and provides some consistency, but it can be trouble when you want  to update, move, or delete things since files are dispersed throughout the  codebase.  In a feature-based codebase, we would end up with a base folder for   our cart, and all of the unique items of the cart would live within that folder  instead of spread out by technology:  src _ actions ___ cartActionCreators.js _ components ___ cart _____ Cart.js _ reducers ___ cartReducers.js _ selectors ___ cartSelectors.js  src _ features  ___ cart  _____ components  _____ actionCreators.js _____ index.js _____ reducer.js _____ selectors.js  86   Chapter 7    InteraCtIng wIth apI Data   While we are not going to use feature folders directly, at some level,  we will treat our pages folder a little bit like a feature. That is, everything  distinct to the page will live within the pages folder. What that means is  we’ll keep our data loading and state management mechanisms near the  page they represent.  With this mindset established, we’re going to update our product list   page with data loading that we can use throughout that section of our  application. In Chapter 8, we’ll look at routing and how we can view our  page screens outside of Storybook.   Loading Data For the data loading, we’re going to start by performing an API request  directly in a Products component. We’ll create a component named  Products in src screens Products Product.js, along with sibling files for our  Storybook story Products.stories.js and an index.js file.  Inside our Products component, we’ll use our ProductList that we   created earlier and render data fetched from an API. Our initial component  could look a little like this:  import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'; import ProductList, { statusTypes }  from '.. .. components  patterns ProductList';  export default function Products   {   const [ productState, setProductState ] = useState {     data: [],     status: statusTypes.loading   } ;  87   Chapter 7    InteraCtIng wIth apI Data     return <ProductList     data={productState.data}     status={productState.status}    > }  In this component, we’re building state to eventually hold our product  data that we’ll pass to our ProductList component. In our Products.stories. js file, we will reference the newly created component as follows:  import React from 'react'; import Products from '. Products';  export default { title: 'screens products' }  export const standard =    => {   return   }  Now, when we run Storybook and navigate to screens ➤ products from   the tree view, we see our component in a Loading state.  Figure 7-1.  Storybook output  88   Chapter 7    InteraCtIng wIth apI Data   Now, let’s fetch some data in our component. We’re going to assume   that in the production version of our application, we’re running an API on  the same server as our front-end application on the path  api. We’ll add a  useEffect statement in our component directly before the return statement  for interacting with this API:  import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'; import ProductList, { statusTypes }  from '.. .. components  patterns ProductList'; export default function Products   {   const [ productState, setProductState ] = useState {     data: [],     status: statusTypes.loading   } ;   useEffect    => {     const getData = async    => {       try {         const productFetch = await fetch ' api products' ;         const productResponse = await productFetch.json  ;          setProductState { data: productResponse.data, status:   statusTypes.loaded }         } catch  ex  {         console.error ex ;         setProductState { data: [], status: statusTypes.errored }        }     }      getData  ;   }, [] ;   return <ProductList     data={productState.data}     status={productState.status}    > }  89   Chapter 7    InteraCtIng wIth apI Data   For those who aren’t familiar, useEffect is a little bit like   componentDidMount in class-based React components. We’re defining an  async method to interact with our API and setting our state when we get a  response back. We don’t need to change anything in the return statement,  because we are already basing the results off of the data property on our  productState object.  Note  we normally don’t need to use another method inside a  useeffect statement. when we want to use async await, however, we  create another method since useeffect cannot be async directly.  Running Storybook may illuminate a problem, however. We our   attempting to interact with an API. In our stories and our tests, we do not  want to use a real API to obtain our data.  Figure 7-2.  Storybook output after attempting to obtain data from  an API  90   Chapter 7    InteraCtIng wIth apI Data   This is great that we can see the component in an error state; however,   we’re trying to see the list of products as the standard view of this screen.  There are a couple of strategies we could employ to ensure that  we could still derive value from Storybook for our screen page-level  components.   Container Presentational Components The first thing we could attempt is split up our component into a Container  and View component. The Container component would be responsible  for obtaining data, and the View component would only be responsible for  displaying data. With this strategy, we would have distinct files Products. container.js and Products.js where Products.js is the View component. This is a strategy that I’ve used successfully on many projects, but   there’s a downside. You’re creating more files than you may need. More  code means there is more surface area for bugs and things you need to  maintain.   Mock Data The technique we’re going to use in this book is mocking the API endpoint  for Storybook  and since we’re using Storybook stories to power our tests,  our tests too . This functionality is provided through the open source  tool Mirage JS  miragejs.com . Mirage will allow us to interact with the  endpoint in our components while replacing any calls to the API with the  data when viewing components in Storybook. We’ll install miragejs with  npm:  npm install —save-dev miragejs  Once npm has finished, we’ll update our test to build a mock API   endpoint that’s used in Storybook  Listing 7-1 .  91   Chapter 7    InteraCtIng wIth apI Data   Listing 7-1.  Products.stories.js  import { Server } from 'miragejs';  let server = new Server  ; server.get ' api products ', { data:   [     {       id: 1,       name: "Mocha",       price: 3.5,        imageUrl: "https:  source.unsplash.com tNALoIZhqVM    200x100 ",      },     ...   ] } ;  We import the server from Mirage and set up a mock that says “when I  request  api products , respond with this data.” Now if we run Storybook,  we can see our mock data being returned instead of the error we saw  previously.  92   Chapter 7    InteraCtIng wIth apI Data   Figure 7-3.  Products page   Wrapping Up In this chapter, we discussed how we can load data in our Screen Page  components. We talked about some of the various techniques we can use  to load data and how we can quickly mock data for Storybook stories and  unit tests.  EXERCISE  So far, we’ve used our mock data to power our Storybook story. the goal  is that we will have a nice test coverage as well. a great exercise would be  creating a series of unit tests that covers this functionality. Using some of the  concepts from this chapter and Chapter 6, create a suite of unit tests that  ensure that we load and display the product list.  93   CHAPTER 8  Building Our  Application  We’ve been working in the safety of our component workspace.  Unfortunately, unless our product is a component library, our users won’t  receive much value from our components unless we place them in our real  application. In this chapter, we’re going to take everything we’ve made so  far using Storybook and apply it to a real application. Our approach with  Storybook is a bit different from how many applications are built, but as  we’ll see in this chapter, when we’re ready to build our actual application,  everything falls into place pretty quickly.   Navigating Between Pages One thing that we’ll need in our application is a way for our coffee  shoppers to visit different pages. We could simply show and hide our  components based on which part of our application is active. This could  work for small applications, but would be unmaintainable at scale. There  are some other problems with this strategy that may be more apparent  with a simple example.  Let’s assume we have some basic page components that represent a   Home and About page:  const Home =    =>  Hi from the home page! ; const About =    =>  Hi from about! ;    Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R. Lanciaux, Modern Front-end Architecture, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6625-0_8  95   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn  Next, we’ll add a basic Navigation component that receives a callback   that’s called when one of the navigation items is clicked. In this case,  we’re going to use a button since we’re currently technically providing  button-like functionality instead of typical link functionality  i.e., we’re not  changing the browser route and instead switching out which content is  present—there’s some nuance here, but we’ll fix this up later :  export const Navigation =  { onChangeNavigation }  => {   return                                        onChangeNavigation "home" }>                                    onChangeNavigation "about" }>   Home   About                              ; };  Next, we’re going to add our Application component as follows. This   Application component will use our pages and our navigation:  function App   {   const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState "home" ;   let content = undefined;   if  currentPage === "home"  {     content =  ;   }  96   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn    if  currentPage === "about"  {     content =  ;   }    return                       {content}          ; } export default App;  In the previous App component, we’re defining a variable, content, that  will hold our page-level content and switching the content based on state.  What are some problems you see with this approach?  While this may seem pretty straightforward, there are some definite   challenges that we may run into using this strategy. First and foremost, this  will not scale well. For two pages, it’s pretty clear what’s going on, but how  would we handle this if we had 20 or more pages? Beyond the developer  experience, this technique would not provide a great experience to our  coffee shoppers either.  What would happen if a patron wanted to bookmark the About page?  Every time they tried to visit the bookmark, they would come back to the  main page since this is controlled by the App state unless we created some  mechanism for rehydrating the active page based on a URL parameter.  At that point, we may be asking ourselves, “Are we just reinventing  the concept of a router?” The answer to that question would be “Yes.”  Thankfully, there is an excellent router that we can use.  97   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn   Routing We’re going to utilize the awesome React Router library. We can now  change our example application to the following:  export default function App   {   return                                                              ; }  From there, we’ll update our Navigation component to use the React   Router–provided Link component, instead of the button elements we were  previously using:     still wrapped in existing nav   ul      Home         About     With this strategy, we define our browser router; this is the top-level  provider for our router and creates our routes contained within a Switch  component. The Switch component basically allows us to say that only  one route is active at a time. Conceptually, we can think of this like a   98   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn  switch statement where only one code path will be executed based on  the provided values. The Route components receive a path and the  component that should be active based on the given path.  For our Navigation component, we’ve updated the buttons to the Link  component from React Router. The link renders as an anchor tag and will,  as the name implies, link to another route. We provide the route path to  our Link components via the to prop  i.e.,   .  Using a router has numerous benefits over manually handling content   visibility based on state and so on. First, using React Router scales quite  a bit better than manually handling content visibility based on state. We  could continue to add routes to our switch statement or even provide  nested routes  see the React Router documentation for more on nested  routes .  React Router provides URL route updates. You may notice if you   run the preceding router example, clicking a link updates the URL. This  means that users can bookmark the pages that they’re on. Additionally,  the Link component is more sensible, since it’s an actual anchor tag rather  than buttons that manipulate state. Buttons worked well as the element  for calling callbacks, but since we’re actually changing the URL with the  router, an anchor tag is better.   Updating Our Application to Use Routes Let’s update our Rocket Coffee application to use routes. Since Chapter 7,  I’ve added some pages for Cart and “My Account.” They’re not hooked up  to a real database or anything, but should suffice for dealing with routing.  99   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn  Figure 8-1.  Basic Cart and User Profile components  We want to organize our system around the concept of routing. What   this means is our src components pages folder will be moved to match the  routes that the patrons of our coffee shop will visit to purchase coffee. This means that for every main route, we’ll have a corresponding  folder in our pages directory and every subroute will map to a specific  subcomponent within that directory. Our file structure could look like the  following:  RocketCoffee _ src  __ components  ____ atoms  ____ patterns  __ screens  ____ Cart  ____ Products  ____ UserProfile   100  Each of our screen folders contains a component, an index file, and a  story  and optionally contains a test and style information . We can view  our pages through Storybook, but we want a real functioning application.  Let’s go ahead and add React Router and use our real app outside of  Storybook.   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn  We’ll start by adding the react-router-dom package from npm. We’re   building a web application, so the DOM version of React Router is what we  want. It has some areas that interact directly with the browser:  npm install react-router-dom  From there, we’re going to add a new file called Routes.js at the top  level of our src directory. We’re going to include React, BrowserRouter,  Switch, and Route from react-router-dom and our page-level components.  Finally, we’ll return the routes to our pages in the Switch component:  import React from "react"; import { BrowserRouter, Switch, Route } from "react-router- dom";  import Cart from ". screens Cart"; import Products from ". screens Products"; import UserProfile from ". screens UserProfile";  export default function Routes   {   return                                                                ; }  Our application screens depend on an API for the data we present.   Unfortunately, this API doesn’t exist. We’ll use the mocking technique that  we applied in Chapter 7 to provide a mock API to our application. We’ll  start by creating a file, Mock.server.js, in our src directory. This file will be  responsible for  101   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn  import { Server } from "miragejs";  const productData = [   {     id: 1,     name: "Mocha",     price: 3.5,     imageUrl: "https:  source.unsplash.com tNALoIZhqVM 200x100 ",   },   {     id: 2,     name: "Latte",     price: 3.5,     imageUrl: "https:  source.unsplash.com tNALoIZhqVM 200x100 ",   },   {     id: 3,     name: "Vanilla Latte",     price: 3.5,     imageUrl: "https:  source.unsplash.com tNALoIZhqVM 200x100 ",   }, ];  const server = new Server {   routes   {     this.namespace = " api";     this.get " cart",    =>  { data: [productData[1]] }  ;     this.get " products",    =>  { data: productData }  ;     this.get " profile",    =>  {         name: "Saige McDermott",         memberSince: "June 12th, 2018",         recentOrders: [  102   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn            { orderId: 12, name: "Latte" },           { orderId: 27, name: "Cafe Miel" },         ],     }  ;      this.get " users",    => [       { id: "1", name: "Luke" },       { id: "2", name: "Leia" },       { id: "3", name: "Anakin" },     ] ;   }, } ;  export default server;  Next, we need to import this mock server in our app. When we have   our real API, we’ll want to remove the code that imports our mock, but for  now, it works out well:  import React from "react"; import '. Mock.server' import Routes from '. Routes';  function App   {   return           ; }  export default App;  Now if we run our application via npm start  or yarn , we should  be able to visit our pages by typing in localhost:3000 , localhost:3000  userProfile, and localhost:3000 cart, respectively.  103   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn   Navigation Let’s add a basic navigation using the Link component from React Router  as well. For the sake of example, we’ll do this by creating a Navigation  component under patterns along with a corresponding index.js barrel  file. We’ll go ahead and create patterns Navigation, an index.js file that  only exports our soon-to-be-created Navigation component, and our  component Navigation.js:     patterns Navigation Navigation.js import React from "react"; import { Link } from "react-router-dom"; export default function Navigation   {   return                                      Products                                 Cart                                 Profile                             ;  }  104   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn  We’ll jump back over to our Routes.js file and add our navigation. We  can use our Products screen from Chapter 7 and other screens from the  example code. From a high level, these screens all obtain data from our  API and use the existing components to present that data to our customers.  We’ll import these screens in our Routes.js file and place them in a React  Router browser router as follows:  import React from "react"; ... import Navigation from ". components patterns Navigation  Navigation";  export default function Routes   {   return                                                                        ; }  We now have a rudimentary navigation along with routes that can be   bookmarked in our application.  105   Chapter 8    Building Our appliCatiOn  Figure 8-2.  Navigation + route output   Wrapping Up In this chapter, we discussed how we can start migrating out of Storybook  into our real application. We were able to quickly make pages out of our  existing components and provide navigation through React Router.  EXERCISE  Our navigation is currently pretty rudimentary. We want something a bit  more sophisticated for our real application. please create a header Footer  component that will show up on each page. the header should link to “ ” and  the footer should contain the same links as our navigation component. Finally,  this header Footer component should live in a layout component that will  contain the header, footer, navigation, and page-level content.  106   CHAPTER 9  Automating Repetitive  Tasks  In this chapter, we’re going to look into how we can speed up our  development. We’ve discussed constructing our application out of a series  of smaller parts. For every page component, pattern component, and  atom component, we end up creating a component, an index file, a test  file, a story, and in many cases a style file. I don’t know about you, but  that’s a lot of effort that I’d rather not do. It’s weird to say, because it’s not a  complicated task, but it is tedious.  Do not use humans for jobs computers can do better—this is a  waste of human energy and creativity, the only real resource  on this planet, and demeans the human spirit.  —J. Paul Morrison, programmer and inventor  I really appreciate this quote. To me, it brings up thoughts of Tony Stark   Iron Man’s alter ego  being assisted by computers to do his job way better  so he can focus on more important things like saving the world. I don’t  know about you, but I wish I had a robot assistant. I would love to hand  off tedious work to a computer so I can keep my attention on the more  important things in a project.    Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R. Lanciaux, Modern Front-end Architecture, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6625-0_9  107   Chapter 9    automating repetitive tasks  While we’re not going to be using as sophisticated computing powers   as science fiction stories, we can leverage computers to make our jobs  easier. Constructing our directory structure is not hard. Let’s use some  software to make that job more straightforward.   Our Own CLI We’re going to create a CLI specific to our project. A CLI is a command-line  interface, that is, an application that runs in the command line. If you’ve  ever used Create React App, npm, yarn, or git, you have interacted with a  CLI. We’re going to construct one that makes the process of creating our  files and directories in the structure we want a process that requires almost  no thought at all.  There are a number of tools that we could use to achieve this goal, such   as Gluegun, Plop, and others. In this book, however, we’re going to use  Hygen  www.hygen.io  .  Hygen is deemed “The scalable code generator that saves you time”  by its documentation. I’ve used several other generators CLI tools, and  I appreciate the clear-cut results-driven architecture of Hygen. Let’s take  a look at a simple example where we’ll create a file with a hello world  function in a specific location. Don’t worry. Hello world isn’t exciting,  but we’ll soon be applying these concepts to our Rocket Coffee codebase.  Ideally, we will be able to run Listing 9-1 from the command line to  generate a component in our app.  Listing 9-1.  Theoretical CLI code generator  > yarn generate component UserForm —location atom  added: src components atoms Button index.js  added: src components atoms Button Button.js  added: src components atoms Button Button.stories.js  added: src components atoms Button Button.test.js  added: src components atoms Button Button.css  108   Chapter 9    automating repetitive tasks   A Brief Example We’ll start by adding Hygen to our computer. There are a couple of ways we  could handle this, but adding it as a global module via npm works well:  npm install -g hygen  if we don’t want to add the hygen tool to our computer, we   Note  could take advantage of npx to achieve a similar result. the npx tool  is a way that we can run a CLi tool that’s hosted on the npm registry.  if you prefer to use npx, anywhere where we reference the globally  installed version of the tool in this guide, use npx instead.  For our example, we’re going to use the Rocket Coffee project that  we’ve been building throughout this book. That said, these same steps  should work in any project.  Hygen uses template files and the surrounding folders to generate CLI   commands. For our “hello world” example, we simply want to run hygen  function new HelloWorld. There are some things beyond installing Hygen  that we need to do to initialize our generator. We’ll start off by running the  following:  hygen init self added: _templates generator help index.ejs.t added: _templates generator with-prompt hello.ejs.t added: _templates generator with-prompt prompt.ejs.t added: _templates generator new hello.ejs.t  This statement initializes Hygen with a generator that we’ll use to   create our other generators. We’re ready to create our function generator:  hygen generator new function  109   Chapter 9    automating repetitive tasks  Hygen will create a new folder in our project. We should navigate to  our _templates function new folder and edit “hello.ejs.t.” Hygen uses the  .t filetype to prevent editors from trying to apply additional IDE features to  this file. It’s likely the IDE won’t know about these templates. The generator  command we will soon run corresponds directly to the folder structure. For  instance, we will run hygen function new {Name} where Name is the input  we’ll provide to our generator. You may notice we have a folder for function,  the first statement in our command, and a function for new as well.  Note  For this example, keeping the template name as hello should  be fine. the template name is more important when we plan on  keeping these files around; the name helps our teammates and  “future us” recognize the intent of the template.  We’ll update the code in _templates function new hello.ejs.t to the   following:  --- to: src components  .js --- console.log "hello world!"   Hygen templates are based on ejs, a popular templating engine for   Node applications. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with this, as knowing  the ins and outs of ejs is not necessary for building a generator. For our  purposes, we want to understand that code in between   will be  output to the file. For example, we are using the variable name to populate  the filename for our document.  In addition to ejs, it’s important to realize that this template consists   of two parts. The top part of the template, surrounded in “—-”, is the front  matter section of the template. Template settings belong in this section  of the document. In the front matter for our “hello world” example, we’re  supplying where the generated output of this generator belongs as the   110   Chapter 9    automating repetitive tasks  to property. For this generator, we’re stating that we want a file with a  given name placed in src components. Now what happens if we run our  generator? If you run into any errors, please ensure that you’ve run the  previous steps, hygen init self  and  hygiene generator new function. Hygen  will not function as we’re anticipating without these steps:  > hygen function new Test Loaded templates: _templates        added: src components Test.js   Building Some Generators for Our Project With this knowledge in hand, let’s build the generators we want to make  working in our codebase easier. We’ll start by renaming the function  folder used in the preceding text from _templates function to _templates  component. You could remove the folder and start the generator process  over again, but I generally prefer this route.  From there, we’ll navigate to _templates component new , rename  the hello.ejs.t file to component.ejs.t, and copy this file to create a basic  index.ejs.t, component.stories.ejs.t, and component.test.ejs.t file. We’ll give  each one of these templates a purpose that relates to its name. We’ll start  by editing the component file. We want it to contain the code in Listing 9-2.  Listing 9-2.  component.ejs.t  --- to: src components atoms    .js --- import React from 'react'  export default function      {   return  Hello from   ; }  111   Chapter 9    automating repetitive tasks  Now, when we run our generator, we see that we create an atom   component in our src folder:  > hygen component new First Loaded templates: _templates        added: src components atoms First First.js  Let’s go ahead and add our basic stories, tests, and index files. These   are definitely not profound, but the time this saves scales as we need more  files in our codebase.  We’ll start with the basic index file  _templates component new   index.ejs.t . For now, we only want this to export the default output from  our component file:  --- to: src components atoms   index.js --- export { default } from '.  ';  Next, we’ll move on to the Storybook stories file  _templates   component new component.stories.ejs.t :  --- to: src components atoms    .stories.js --- import React from 'react' import   from '.  '  export default { title: 'atoms  '} export const Standard =    =>    >  Lastly, we’ll create our test file   _templates component new   component.test.ejs.t :  112   Chapter 9    automating repetitive tasks  --- to: src components atoms    .test.js --- import React from 'react' import { screen, render } from '@testing-library react';  import   from '.  '; describe ' ',    => {   it 'renders as expected',    => {     const { container } = render    > ;     expect container .toMatchSnapshot  ;   }  }   Now, we can run our generator and see that it created a new   component and sibling story test files:  > hygen component new TextInput Loaded templates: _templates   added: src components atoms TextInput TextInput.js   added: src components atoms TextInput TextInput.stories.js   added: src components atoms TextInput TextInput.test.js   added: src components atoms TextInput index.js  We can run our tests or Storybook and everything works as expected,  and our new tests pass. This is great and can save a lot of time; however,  we have a problem. Remember we are classifying our components as  atoms, patterns, and pages? Unfortunately, we’re currently hardcoding our  generated components to be atoms. Let’s fix that.  113    automating repetitive tasks  Chapter 9   Adding Additional Variables to Our Generator We need to make our generator accept an additional parameter, type.  While there are a couple ways we could handle this  such as logic in our  template files , we’re going to build a reusable helper. All of our templates  need to know what type of component is being created, so this reusable  technique will help us avoid duplicating code.  Hygen has a top-level h object that has the default Hygen helpers. We   can add on to this object by creating a file in the root of our project named   .hygen.js and creating a helpers object with the functions we wish to leverage  in our templates  Listing 9-3 . We’re going to make two helper functions that  receive the type supplied from the command line: one to obtain the folder path  and one to obtain the name of the type. We’ll create an object to hold the values  for each possible type. That way, we can add on to this later or change things  without needing to update every helper function where a value is present.  Listing 9-3.  .hygen.js in the root of our project  const types = {   atom: { name: 'atoms', path: 'components atoms '},   pattern: { name: 'patterns', path: 'components patterns '},   screen: { name: 'screens', path: 'screens '} } module.exports = {   helpers: {     getTypePath:  type = 'atom'  => {       return types[type].path;     },     getType:  type = 'atom'  => {       return types[type].name     }    } }  114   Chapter 9    automating repetitive tasks  Now when we use this helper method, any type that we pass in as an   argument to our generator will be used to determine where the files live. Now,  let’s update the story template to use our helper methods. One thing to note is  we generally could reference our type variable simply as type; however, that  would imply that type is required. We have our generator set up so that when  type is not specified, it will default to an atom. We will use Hygen’s locals object  to obtain our type rather than the type variable directly  Listing 9-4 .  Listing 9-4.  _templates component new component.stories.ejs.t  --- to: src       .stories.js --- import React from 'react' import   from '.  '  export default { title: '  <%=   name %>'}  export const Standard =    =>    >  We can go ahead and update the rest of our templates to use this new   helper method. After that’s complete, running our generator works for  atoms, patterns, and screen components. The following command will  generate a new component under our screens directory with supporting  test, story, and index files:  > hygen component new UserProfile --type screen  Loaded templates: _templates   added: src screens UserProfile UserProfile.js   added: src screens UserProfile UserProfile.stories.js   added: src screens UserProfile UserProfile.test.js   added: src screens UserProfile index.js  115   Chapter 9    automating repetitive tasks   Wrapping Up We now have the ability to generate our files that we’ll use to power our  front-end application. While some may argue that creating files is not  challenging, this now frees us to focus on more important things. We’ve  placed the responsibility of building our app structure on a repeatable  process. Instead of needing to constantly check pull requests for correct  folder structure, we can rely on the “robot doing it just effectively.”  Additionally, the generator can help facilitate communication. When   a new developer is onboarded to our team, we can talk about running  the generator instead of tedious discussions around where different files  belong. Additionally, if we ever want to update where a file belongs, we  can update the template and avoid scenarios where we create files in their  previous schema out of habit.  EXERCISE  our primary focus has been on the component, test, and story files. We didn’t  address the creation of a style file. Create a template that will generate a local  Css module as part of the hygen component new command.  116   CHAPTER 10  Communicating Our  Components  So far, we’ve mostly been focused on strategies to make developing our  applications more straightforward. Success in software development  hinges on much more than merely writing good code, however. Projects  can be a win or a loss, depending on how well people communicate.  Thankfully, Storybook helps us here too.  As you may have guessed, Storybook helps us communicate with other   developers which components exist in a codebase. How many projects  have you been on where the same component or snippet of code lived in  many places, simply because a developer had no idea the functionality  existed elsewhere? Using a component workspace that all the developers  can reference and see a working version of the component helps with  this communication. The strategies we’ve employed so far are useful to  developers, but we can do a bit more.   Documenting Our Components We want to help other developers get up to speed with components as  quickly as possible. Only having stories helps in that endeavor, but we  could make the experience a bit nicer than merely directing developers to  look at the code that powers the stories. We’ll start by adding additional  documentation properties to our stories. Using our Rocket Coffee  codebase, let’s start making these updates.    Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R. Lanciaux, Modern Front-end Architecture, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6625-0_10  117   Chapter 10    CommuniCating our Components  Storybook can help us with this documentation also. Remember  that our stories’ default export is an object? We have some additional  properties we can use to provide some documentation with our stories.  To add some detailed documentation to our stories, we’ll need to   include the docs add-on:  > yarn add @storybook addon-docs  From there, we’ll need to update our Storybook’s main.js file to include   this new add-on in Listing 10-1.  Listing 10-1.  .storybook main.js  module.exports = {   stories: [".. src ** *.stories.js"],   addons: [     "@storybook preset-create-react-app",     "@storybook addon-actions",     "@storybook addon-links",     "@storybook addon-knobs",     "@storybook addon-docs"   ], };  Now, if we fire up Storybook, we’ll see a new tab called Docs next to the  main Storybook output. You’ll notice it shows our component, a way to see  the markup for the component, and our args table.  Now, if we fire up Storybook we’ll see a new tab called docs next to the   main Storybook output.  118   Chapter 10    CommuniCating our Components  Figure 10-1.  Storybook’s Docs tab  This Docs tab is pretty useful out of the box. We have another view of   our stories and have a way to quickly view the code. Let’s add a description  to the args table at the bottom of the listing.  In addition to the standard, title, and component properties that   we’ve seen before on our story’s default export, we’re going to leverage the  argTypes property  Listing 10-2 . This property allows us to provide some  additional metadata to the args table.  Listing 10-2.  Button.stories.js  export default {   title: "atoms button",   component: Button,   argTypes: {     children: {        description: "The element s  that should be rendered   within the button",        default: "undefined",     },  119   Chapter 10    CommuniCating our Components      onClick: {        description: "The action that is fired when the button is   pressed",      },   }, };  the args table.  If we load our Storybook, we will see the descriptions we provided in   Figure 10-2.  Updated args table  These descriptions that we’ve provided as part of the argTypes   property support Markdown to provide some light styling to our text.  If you’re not familiar with Markdown, I recommend visiting Mastering  Markdown from GitHub  https:  guides.github.com features  mastering-markdown  .  Note  markdown is a nice addition, but it’s not necessary to use  with storybook docs. Feel free to only dive into learning more about  markdown if it’s something you want to use.  Taking a similar approach, we can now add an overall description to   the story as well:  export default {   title: "atoms button",   component: Button,  120   Chapter 10    CommuniCating our Components    parameters: {     docs: {       description: {         component:            "The **button** is the component that should fire an   action based on a click event.",        },     },   },   ... };  We’ll add a property on our default export parameters.docs.description. component that contains the description we want to display with our story.  This field also supports Markdown.  Figure 10-3.  Our story docs with a description   More Advanced Documentation This works pretty well, but what if we want more control over our  documentation? There’s quite a lot we can do with the Storybook  default object, but it can be tedious to update our docs entirely through  a JavaScript object. Thankfully, we can provide documentation using a  different strategy.  121    CommuniCating our Components  Chapter 10   MDX We also can use Markdown, or more specifically MDX, to write our stories.  According to the documentation site  mdxjs.com , “MDX is an authorable  format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents.”  This is an optional way to document Storybook stories, but may be  preferred if the goal is to provide stories alongside documentation.  We’ll start off by updating our .storybook main.js to add support for   mdx files:  module.exports = {    stories: [".. src ** *.stories.js", ".. src ** *.stories.mdx"],   addons: [...], };  Next, we’ll create a new file to contain our MDX documentation at src   components atoms Button Button.stories.mdx and populate it with the  following MDX content. Remember, MDX is a combination of JSX and  Markdown. We’ll still import our references as we would in any standard  JavaScript file:  import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from "@storybook addon-docs blocks"; import Button from ". Button";    Button  This is the **Button** component. The intent of the **Button** is ...   Click here   _This is a button outside of the Storybook Canvas_   More documentation           <Button  122   Chapter 10    CommuniCating our Components        onClick={...}     >       Click me             Other markdown like [Links] http:  www.google.com  work also!  In the previous example, we’re rendering some standard Markdown,   along with our Button component inline with the Markdown and our  Button component contained within a Storybook canvas.  Now, visiting the Docs tab for the button story displays Figure 10-4.  Figure 10-4.  Storybook docs output  123   Chapter 10    CommuniCating our Components  This provides great documenting functionality to our component   workspace. The ease and flexibility of Markdown coupled with the power  of JSX give us documentation superpowers.   Sharing Our Workspace We mentioned that one of the goals we have in using Storybook is to use it  as a communication tool, as well as a tool for developers. Unfortunately,  right now, anyone that wants to view the component workspace needs  to pull down our repository from git and run npm run storybook  or yarn  storybook . This works really well for developers, but isn’t so great for those  who don’t want to interact with the code  or git . Thankfully, it’s pretty  straightforward to build our Storybook in a way that we can deploy it to a  server:  npm run build-storybook  We should be notified that Storybook has created a compiled version of  our workspace in storybook-static. We can deploy the code from this folder  to a server or have this happen automatically as part of a CI process. This is  a bit outside the scope of this study, but it is a scenario that is supported by  Storybook.   Wrapping Up In this book, we’ve looked at why we should use a component workspace,  how it helps us build better software, and how we can use it to help us  facilitate better communication. It’s interesting that these are things that  we need to write good software. The tooling isn’t the only way that we can  achieve good software, but it certainly helps.  124   Index  A, B API data  considerations, 84, 85 data loading  container presentational   components, 91 mock data, 91–93 ProductList component, 88 products component, 87 Storybook output, 88, 90 useEffect statement, 89  argTypes property, 119 Automating repetitive tasks  build generators  adding variables, 114, 115 component file, 111 index file, 112 navigation, 111 run, 112, 113 Storybook stories file, 112 test file, 112, 113  CLI  generator, 108 Hygen, 108 tools, 108  C Cascading Style Sheets  CSS , 60  benefits, 61 building theme, 69, 70 drawbacks, 61, 62 element IDs, 61 HTML elements, 60 JavaScript  benefits, 67 Card component, 65 defaultProps, 66 drawbacks, 67 emotion, 66 React components, 64 rendering, 66 style, 65 styled-components, 66  login box, 61 preprocessors, 62, 63  benefits, 63 drawbacks, 64  selector, 60 styling solution, 68 utility-first styling   libraries, 67, 68    Ryan Lanciaux 2021  R.

Learn how to build front-end applications that can help you ship applications faster with fewer defects. Many software projects fail because they are not planned well, or lack organization. Applying strategies from other industries can help you create better software. This book explores the “mise en place” technique from cooking and reveals how you can apply it to the art of creating software.

In many professional kitchens, the work of preparing a meal is divided and performed in workstations to help create the whole. You'll review the philosophy behind this and see how to leverage this approach in your code. You'll also learn to visualize your applications as a series of components and build parts of your application in isolation - just like a professional chef crafting each part of the meal.

The book describes to how to structure your code base for reuse, and how to communicate the code’s intent to other developers. You’ll develop your components in isolation and test these building blocks for quality at a granular level. Then compose these components as building blocks in increasingly complicated features. Finally, you’ll apply some strategies not directly related to code to ensure maximum quality and efficiency.

With Modern Front-end Architecture, developers of all levels will learn strategies that they and their teams can leverage to be more productive.
