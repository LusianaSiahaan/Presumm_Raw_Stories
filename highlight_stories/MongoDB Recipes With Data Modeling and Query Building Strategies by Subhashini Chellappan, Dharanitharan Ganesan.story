Ganesan, MongoDB Recipes,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4891-1_1  1   Chapter 1    MongoDB Features anD InstallatIon   The Need for NoSQL Databases There are several database challenges for modern applications, including  the following.     Modern application storage capacity exceeds the   storage capabilities of the traditional relational  database management system  RDBMS .     Modern applications require unknown level of   scalability.     Modern applications should be available 24 7.     Data needs to be distributed globally.     Users should be able to read and write data anywhere.     Users always seek reduction of software and    hardware costs.  All these challenges have given birth to the NoSQL databases.   What Are NoSQL Databases? NoSQL databases are open source, nonrelational, distributed databases  that allow organizations to analyze huge volumes of data.  The following are some of the key advantages of NoSQL databases:     Availability.     Fault tolerance.     Scalability.  2   Chapter 1    MongoDB Features anD InstallatIon  NoSQL databases have the following characteristics:     They do not use SQL as a query language.     Most NoSQL databases are designed to run on clusters.     They operate without a schema, freely adding fields to  the database without having to define any changes in  structure first.     They are polygot persistent, meaning there are different   ways to store the data based on the requirements.     They are designed in such a way that they can be    scaled out.   CAP Theorem The CAP theorem states that any distributed system can satisfy only two of  these three properties:     Consistency implies that every read fetches the    last write.     Availability implies that reads and writes always   succeed. In other words, each nonfailing node will  return a response in a reasonable amount of time.     Partition tolerance implies that the system will   continue to function even when there is a data loss or  system failure.  3   Chapter 1    MongoDB Features anD InstallatIon  Figure 1-1 is a graphical representation of the CAP theorem.  Figure 1-1.  CAP theorem  CAP therorem categorizes a system according to three categories:    1.  Consistency and availability.    2.  Consistency and partition tolerance.    3.  Availability and partition tolerance.  Note  the partition tolerance property is a must for nosQl databases.   BASE Approach NoSQL databases are based on the BASE approach. BASE stands for:     Basic availability: The database should be available   most of the time.     Soft state: Tempory inconsistency is allowed.     Eventual consistency: The system will come to a   consistent state after a certain period.  4   Chapter 1    MongoDB Features anD InstallatIon   Types of NoSQL Databases NoSQL databases are generally classified into four types, as shown in  Table 1-1.  Table 1-1.  Types of NoSQL Databases  Data Model  Example  Description  Key Value store  Dynamo DB, riak  Column store  hBase, Big table  Document store MongoDB, CouchDB  graph Database  neo4j       least complex nosQl options.      Key and a value.       also known as wide column store.       storing data tables as sections of   columns of data.       extends key value idea.      storing data as a document.      Complex nosQl options.       each document contains a unique   key that is used to retrieve the  document.       Based on graph theory.       storing data as nodes, edges, and   properties.   MongoDB Features MongoDB is an open source, document-oriented NoSQL database written  in C++. MongoDB provides high availability, automatic scaling, and high  performance. The following sections introduce the features of MongoDB.  5    MongoDB Features anD InstallatIon  Chapter 1   Document Database In MongoDB, a record is represented as a document. A document is a  combination of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar  to JavaScript Object Notation  JSON  documents. Figure 1-2 represents a  document.  Figure 1-2.  A document  These are the advantages for using documents.      In many programming languages, a document  corresponds to native data types.     Embedded documents help in reducing expensive joins.   MongoDB Is Schemaless MongoDB is a schemaless database, which means a collection  like a table  in an RDBMS  can hold different documents  like records in an RDBMS .  This way, MongoDB provides flexibility in dealing with the schemas in a  database. Refer to the following collection, Person.  {name:"Aruna M S", age:12 }   document with two fields. {ssn:100023412, name:"Anbu M S",groups:["sports","news"]}     document with three fields.  Here, the collection Person has two documents, each with different   fields, contents, and size.  6   Chapter 1    MongoDB Features anD InstallatIon   MongoDB Uses BSON JSON is an open source standard format for data interchange. Document  databases use JSON format to store records. Here is an example of a JSON  document.  {       name:"John",       addresses:[                 {                     address:"123,River Road",                     status:"office"                 },                 {                     address:"345,Mount Road",                     status:"personal"                  }                  ]     }  MongoDB represents JSON documents in a binary-encoded format,  Binary JSON  BSON , behind the scenes. BSON extends the JSON model  to provide additional data types such as dates that are not supported by  JSON. BSON uses the _id field called ObjectId as the primary key. The  value of the _id field is generated either by the MongoDB service or by an  application program. Here is an example of ObjectId:  "_id": ObjectId "12e6789f4b01d67d71da3211"   7    MongoDB Features anD InstallatIon  Chapter 1   Rich Query Language MongoDB provides a rich query language to support create, read, update,  and delete  CRUD  operations, data aggregation, and text searches. Let  us understand how to query a collection in MongoDB with an example.  Consider the following collection, Employee.  {_id: 10001, name:"Subhashini",unit:"Hadoop"} {_id: 10002, name:"Shobana", unit:"Spark"}  To display employee details, the MongoDB query would be  db.Employee.find  ;  We discuss MongoDB query language in detail in Chapter 2.   Aggregation Framework MongoDB provides an aggregation framework to perform aggregation  operations. The aggregation framework can group data from multiple  documents and perform variety operations on that grouped data.  MongoDB provides an aggregation pipeline, the map-reduce function, and  single-purpose aggregation methods to perform aggregation operations.  We discuss the aggregation framework in detail in Chapter 3.   Indexing Indexes improve the performance of query execution. MongoDB uses  indexes to limit the number of documents scanned. We discuss various  indexes in Chapter 4.  8   Chapter 1    MongoDB Features anD InstallatIon   GridFS GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving large files. GridFS can  be used to store files that exceed the BSON maximum document size of  16 MB. GridFS divides the file into parts known as chunks and stores them  as separate documents. GridFS divides the file into chunks of 255 KB,  except the last chunk, the size of which is based on the file size.   Replication Replication is a process of copying an instance of a database to a different  database server to provide redundancy and high availability. Replication  provides fault tolerance against the loss of a single database server. In  MongoDB, the replica set is a group of mongod processes that maintain the  same data set. We discuss how to create replica sets in Chapter 5.   Sharding A single server can be a challenge when we need to work with large data  sets and high throughput applications in terms of central processing  unit  CPU  and inout output  I O  capacity. MongoDB uses sharding to  support large data sets and high-throughput operations. Sharding is a  method for distributing data across multiple systems, discussed in detail in  Chapter 5.   The mongo Shell The mongo shell is an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB. The  mongo shell is used to query, update data, and perform administrative  operations. The mongo shell is a component of MongoDB distributions.  When you start the mongod process, the mongo shell will be connected to a  MongoDB instance.  9   Chapter 1    MongoDB Features anD InstallatIon   Terms Used in MongoDB Let us understand the terms used in MongoDB, provided in Table 1-2.

Subhashini Chellappan and Dharanitharan Ganesan 2020  S. Chellappan and D. Ganesan, MongoDB Recipes,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4891-1_2  25   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   Collections MongoDB collections are similar to tables in RDBMS. In MongoDB,  collections are created automatically when we refer to them in a  command. For an example, consider the following command.  db.person.insert {_id:100001,name:"Taanushree A S",age:10}   This command creates a collection named person if it is not present.    If it is present, it simply inserts a document into the person collection.   Recipe 2-1. Create a Collection In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to create a collection.   Problem You want to create a collection named person using the db. createCollection   command.   Solution Use the following syntax to create a collection.  db.createCollection       How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to create a collection named person.  26   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  To create a collection by the name person use the following command.   Step 1: Create a Collection  db.createCollection "person"   Here is the output,  > db.createCollection "person"  { "ok" : 1 } >  in the mongo shell.  > show collections person >  To confirm the existence of the collection, type the following command   We can now see the collection named person.   Recipe 2-2. Create Capped Collections In this recipe, we are going to discuss what a capped collection is and how  to create one. Capped collections are fixed-size collection for which we  can specify the maximum size of the collection in bytes and the number of  documents allowed. Capped collections work similar to a circular buffer:  Once it fills its allocated space, it makes room for new documents by  overwriting the oldest documents in the collection.  There are some limitations of capped collections:     You can’t shard capped collections.     You can’t use the aggregation pipeline operator $out to   write results to a capped collection.  27   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations     You can’t delete documents from a capped collection.     Creating an index allows you to perform efficient   update operations.   Problem You want to create a capped collection named student using the db. createCollection   method.   Solution Use the following syntax to create a collection.  db.createCollection   ,{capped: ,size: ,max : }    How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to create a capped collection named  student.   Step 1: Create a Capped Collection  To create a capped collection named student, use the following command.  db.createCollection "student",{capped: true,size:1000,max:2}   Here, size denotes the maximum size of the collection in bytes and   max denotes the maximum number of documents allowed. Here is the output,  > db.createCollection "student",{capped: true,size:1000,max:2}  { "ok" : 1 } >  28   To check if a collection is capped, type the following command in the   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  mongo shell.  > db.student.isCapped   true >  We can see that the student collection is capped. Now, we will insert   few documents into the student collection, as shown next.  db.student.insert [{ "_id" : 10001, "name" : "Taanushree A S",  "age" : 10 },{ "_id" : 10002, "name" : "Aruna M S", "age" : 14 }]   Here is the output,  > db.student.insert [{ "_id" : 10001, "name" : "Taanushree A  S", "age" : 10 },{ "_id" : 10002, "name" : "Aruna M S", "age" :  14 }]  BulkWriteResult {         "writeErrors" : [ ],         "writeConcernErrors" : [ ],         "nInserted" : 2,         "nUpserted" : 0,         "nMatched" : 0,         "nModified" : 0,         "nRemoved" : 0,         "upserted" : [ ] }  >   Step 2: Query a Capped Collection  To query a capped collection, use the following command.  db.student.find    29   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  > db.student.find   { "_id" : 10001, "name" : "Taanushree A S", "age" : 10 } { "_id" : 10002, "name" : "Aruna M S", "age" : 14 } >  Here, MongoDB retrieves the results in the order of insertion. To   retrieve documents in the reverse order, use sort   and set the $natural  parameter to -1 as shown here.  > db.student.find  .sort {$natural:-1}  { "_id" : 10002, "name" : "Aruna M S", "age" : 14 } { "_id" : 10001, "name" : "Taanushree A S", "age" : 10 } >  We can see the results are now in the reverse order.   Step 3: Insert a Document into a Full Capped Collection  Let’s see what happens when we try to insert a document into a capped  collection that has reached its capacity already using the following  command.  db.student.insert {_id:10003,name:"Anba V M",age:16}   Here is the output,  > db.student.insert {_id:10003,name:"Anba V M",age:16}  WriteResult { "nInserted" : 1 }   To query the student collection, use the following command.  > db.student.find   { "_id" : 10002, "name" : "Aruna M S", "age" : 14 } { "_id" : 10003, "name" : "Anba V M", "age" : 16 } >  30   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Notice that the first document is overwritten by the third document,  as the maximum number of documents allowed in the student capped  collection is two.   Create Operations Create operations allow us to insert documents into a collection. These  insert operations target a single collection. All write operations are atomic  at the level of a single document.  MongoDB provides several methods for inserting documents, listed in   Table 2-1.  Table 2-1.  Insert Methods  db.collection.insertOne  inserts a single document  db.collection.insertMany  inserts multiple documents  db.collection.insert  inserts a single document or multiple documents   Recipe 2-3. Insert Documents In this recipe, we are going to discuss various methods to insert documents  into a collection.   Problem You want to insert documents into the collection person.  31    MongoDB CrUD operations  Chapter 2   Solution Use the following syntax to insert documents.  db.collection.insertOne   db.collection.insertMany     How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to insert documents into the collection  person.   Step 1: Insert a Single Document  To insert a single document into the collection person, use the following  command.  db.person.insertOne {_id:1001,name:"Taanushree AS",age:10}   Here is the output,  > db.person.insertOne {_id:1001,name:"Taanushree AS",age:10}  { "acknowledged" : true, "insertedId" : 1001 } >  insertOne   returns a document that contains the newly inserted   document’s _id.  If you don’t specify an _id field, MongoDB generates an _id field with   an ObjectId value. The _id field act as the primary key.  32   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is an example:  > db.person.insertOne {name:"Aruna MS",age:14}  {         "acknowledged" : true,         "insertedId" : ObjectId "5bac7a5113572c1fb994d2fe"  } >   Step 2: Insert Multiple Documents  To insert multiple documents into the collection person, use the following  command.  db.person.insertMany [{_id:1003,name:"Anba V M",age:16},{_id:10 04,name:"shobana",age:44}]   Pass an array of documents to the insertMany   method to insert   multiple documents. Here is the output,  > db.person.insertMany [{_id:1003,name:"Anba V M",age:16},{_id: 1004,name:"shobana",age:44}]  { "acknowledged" : true, "insertedIds" : [ 1003, 1004 ] } >   Read Operations Read operations allow us to retrieve documents from a collection.  MongoDB provides the find   method to query documents.  The syntax for the find   command is  db.collection.find    33   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  You can specify query filters or criteria inside the find   method to   query documents based on conditions.   Recipe 2-4. Query Documents In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to retrieve documents from a  collection.   Problem You want to retrieve documents from a collection.   Solution Use the following syntax to retrieve documents from a collection.  db.collection.find     How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to query documents in a collection.   Step 1: Select All Documents in a collection  To select all documents in a collection, use the following command.  db.person.find {}   find   method.  You need to pass an empty document as a query parameter to the   34   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  > db.person.find {}  { "_id" : 1001, "name" : "Taanushree AS", "age" : 10 } { "_id" : ObjectId "5bac86dc773204ddade95819" , "name" : "Aruna  MS", "age" : 14 } { "_id" : 1003, "name" : "Anba V M", "age" : 16 } { "_id" : 1004, "name" : "shobana", "age" : 44 } >   Step 2: Specify Equality Conditions  To specify an equality condition, you need to use  :   expressions in the query to filter documents.  To select a document from the collection person where the name   equals "shobana", here is the command:  db.person.find {name:"shobana"}   Here is the output,  > db.person.find {name:"shobana"}  { "_id" : 1004, "name" : "shobana", "age" : 44 } >   Step 3: Specify Conditions Using Query Operator  To select all documents from the collection person where age is greater  than 10, here is the command:  db.person.find {age:{$gt:10}}   35   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  > db.person.find {age:{$gt:10}}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5bac86dc773204ddade95819" , "name" : "Aruna  MS", "age" : 14 } { "_id" : 1003, "name" : "Anba V M", "age" : 16 } { "_id" : 1004, "name" : "shobana", "age" : 44 } >   Step 4: Specify AND Conditions  In a compound query, you can specify conditions for more than one field.  To select all documents in the person collection where the name equals  "shobana" and the age is greater than 10, here is the command:  db.person.find { name:"shobana",age:{$gt:10}}   Here is the output,  > db.person.find { name:"shobana",age:{$gt:10}}  { "_id" : 1004, "name" : "shobana", "age" : 44 }   Step 5: Specify OR Conditions  You can use $or in a compound query to join each clause with a logical or  conjunction.  The operator $or selects the documents from the collection that match   at least one of the selected conditions.  To select all documents in the person collection where the name   equals "shobana" or age equals 20, here is the command:  db.person.find  { $or: [ { name: "shobana" }, { age: { $eq: 20  } } ] }    >  36   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  >  > db.person.find  { $or: [ { name: "shobana" }, { age: { $eq:  20 } } ] }   { "_id" : 1004, "name" : "shobana", "age" : 44 }   Update Operations Update operations allow us to modify existing documents in a collection.  MongoDB provides the update methods listed in Table 2-2.  Table 2-2.  Update Methods  db.collection.updateone  to modify a single document  db.collection.updateMany  to modify multiple documents  db.collection.replaceone  to replace the first matching document in the  collection that matches the filter  In MongoDB, update operations target a single collection.   Recipe 2-5. Update Documents In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to update documents.   Problem You want to update documents in a collection.  37    MongoDB CrUD operations  Chapter 2   Solution The following methods are used to update documents in a collection.  db.collection.updateOne   db.collection.updateMany   db.collection.replaceOne    Execute the following code in the mongo shell to create the student   collection.  db.student.insertMany [{_id:1001,name:"John",marks:{english:35, maths:38},result:"pass"},{_id:1002,name:"Jack",marks:{english:1 5,maths:18},result:"fail"},{_id:1003,name:"John",marks:{english :25,maths:28},result:"pass"},{_id:1004,name:"James",marks:{engl ish:32,maths:40},result:"pass"},{_id:1005,name:"Joshi",marks:{e nglish:15,maths:18},result:"fail"},{_id:1006,name:"Jack",marks: {english:35,maths:36},result:"pass"}]    How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to update documents in a collection.   Step 1: Update a Single Document  MongoDB provides modify operators to modify field values such as $set.  To use the update operators, pass to the update methods an update   document of the form:  {    : {  :  , ... },    : {  :  , ... },   ... }  38   To update the first document where name equals joshi, execute the   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  db.student.updateOne {name: "Joshi"},{$set:{"marks.english": 20}}   following command.  Here is the output,  > db.student.updateOne {name: "Joshi"},{$set:{"marks.english": 20}}  { "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 1, "modifiedCount" : 1 } >  Confirm that the field marks has been updated in the student collection:  > db.student.find {name:"Joshi"}  { "_id" : 1005, "name" : "Joshi", "marks" : { "english" : 20,  "maths" : 18 }, "result" : "fail" } >  Note  You cannot update the _id field.   Step 2: Update Multiple Documents  Use the following code to update all documents in the student collection  where result equals fail.  db.student.updateMany  { "result":"fail" }, { $set: { "marks. english": 20, marks.maths: 20 }  }   Here is the output,  > db.student.updateMany  { "result":"fail" }, { $set: {"marks. english": 20, "marks.maths": 20 }}  { "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 2, "modifiedCount" : 2 } >  39   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here, the modifiedCount is 2, which indicates that the preceding   command modified two documents in the student collection.   Step 3: Replace a Document  You can replace the entire content of a document except the _id field  by passing an entirely new document as the second argument to db. collection.replaceOne   as shown here.  Execute the following command to replace the first document from the   student collection where name equals "John".  db.student.replaceOne  { name: "John" }, {_id:1001,name:"John", marks:{english:36,maths:39},result:"pass"}   Here is the output,  > db.student.replaceOne  { name: "John" }, {_id:1001,name:"John ",marks:{english:36,maths:39},result:"pass"}  { "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 1, "modifiedCount" :  1 } >  Note  Do not include update operators in the replacement  document. You can omit the _id field in the replacement document  because the _id field is immutable. however, if you want to include  the _id field, use the same value as the current value.   Delete Operations Delete operations allow us to delete documents from a collection.  MongoDB provides two delete methods, as shown in Table 2-3.  40   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Table 2-3.  Delete Methods  db.collection.deleteOne  to delete a single document  db.collection.updateMany  to delete multiple documents  In MongoDB, delete operations target a single collection.   Recipe 2-6. Delete Documents In this recipe, we discuss how to delete documents.   Problem You want to delete documents from a collection.   Solution The following methods are used to delete documents from a collection.  db.collection.deleteOne   db.collection.deleteMany     How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to delete documents in a collection.   Step 1: Delete Only One Document That Matches  a Condition  To delete a document from the collection student where name is John, use  this code.  db.student.deleteOne {name: "John"}   41   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  > db.student.deleteOne {name: "John"}  { "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 1 } >   Step 2: Delete All Documents That Match a Condition  To delete all documents from the collection student where name is Jack,  use this code.  db.student.deleteMany {name: "Jack"}   Here is the output,  > db.student.deleteMany {name: "Jack"}  { "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 2 } >   Step 3: Delete All Documents from a Collection  To delete all documents from the collection student, pass an empty  filter document to the db.student.deleteMany   method.  db.student.deleteMany {}   Here is the output,  > db.student.deleteMany {}  { "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 3 } >  42   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   MongoDB Import and Export The MongoDB import tool allows us to import content from JSON,  comma-separated value  CSV , and tab-separated value  TSV  files.  MongoDB import only supports files that are UTF-8 encoded.  The MongoDB export tool allows us to export data stored in MongoDB   instances as JSON or CSV files.   Recipe 2-7. Work with Mongo Import In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to import data from a CSV file.   Problem You want to import data from the student.csv file to the students collection.   Solution The following command is used to perform a Mongo import.  mongoimport  Note  to work with the Mongo import command, start the mongod  process and open another command prompt to issue the mongo  import command.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to work with Mongo import.  43   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Create a student.csv file using the following data in the C:\Sample\   directory.  _id,name,class 1,John,II 2,James,III 3,Joshi,I  Execute the following command to import data from the student.csv   file to the students collection.  mongoimport --db student --collection students --type csv  --headerline --file c:\Sample\student.csv  Here is the output,  C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>mongoimport --db  student --collection students --type csv --headerline --file  c:\Sample\student.csv 2018-09-28T07:00:20.909+0530    connected to: localhost 2018-09-28T07:00:20.969+0530    imported 3 documents  C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>  To confirm the existence of the students collection, issue the following   commands.  > use student switched to db student > show collections students > db.students.find   { "_id" : 1, "name" : "John", "class" : "II" } { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Joshi", "class" : "I" } { "_id" : 2, "name" : "James", "class" : "III" } >  44   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   Recipe 2-8. Work with Mongo Export In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to export data from the  students collection to a student.json file.   Problem You want to export data from the students collection to a student.json file.   Solution The following command is used to perform a Mongo export.  mongoexport  Note  to work with the Mongo export command, start the mongod  process and open another command prompt to issue the Mongo  export command.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to work with Mongo export.  Execute the following command to export data from the students   collection to a student.json file.  mongoexport --db student --collection students --out C:\Sample\ student.json  45   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>mongoexport --db  student --collection students --out C:\Sample\student.json 2018-09-28T07:11:19.446+0530    connected to: localhost 2018-09-28T07:11:19.459+0530    exported 3 records  The confirm the export, open the student.json file.  {"_id":1,"name":"John","class":"II"} {"_id":2,"name":"James","class":"III"} {"_id":3,"name":"Joshi","class":"I"}   Embedded Documents in MongoDB Using embedded documents allows us to embed a document within  another document. Consider this example.  {_id:1001,name:"John",marks:{english:35,maths:38},result:"pass"}  Here, the marks field contains an embedded document. Execute the following code to create an employee database and   employee collection.  use employee  db.employee.insertMany [{_id:1001,name:"John",address:{previous :"123,1st Main",current:"234,2nd Main"},unit:"Hadoop"},  {_id:1002,name:"Jack", address:{previous:"Cresent  Street",current:"234,Bald Hill Street"},unit:"MongoDB"},  {_id:1003,name:"James", address:{previous:"Cresent  Street",current:"234,Hill Street"},unit:"Spark"}]   46   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   Recipe 2-9. Query Embedded Documents In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to query embedded documents.   Problem You want to query embedded documents.   Solution The following command is used to query embedded documents.  db.collection.find    You need to pass the filter document { : } to the find     method where   is the document to match.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to query embedded documents.   Step 1: Match an Embedded or Nested Document  To perform an equality match on the embedded document, you need to  specify the exact match document in the   document, including the  field order.  To select all documents where the address field equals the document   {previous:"Cresent Street",current:"234,Bald Hill Street"}:  db.employee.find  { address: { previous:"Cresent  Street",current:"234,Bald Hill Street" }}    47   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  > db.employee.find  { address: { previous:"Cresent  Street",current:"234,Bald Hill Street" }}   { "_id" : 1002, "name" : "Jack", "address" : { "previous" :  "Cresent Street", "current" : "234,Bald Hill Street" }, "unit"  : "MongoDB" } >   Step 2: Query on a Nested Field  We can use dot notation to query a field of the embedded document.  To select all documents where the previous field nested in the address   field equals "Cresent Street",  db.employee.find  { "address.previous": "Cresent Street" }    Here is the output,  > db.employee.find  { "address.previous": "Cresent Street" }   { "_id" : 1002, "name" : "Jack", "address" : { "previous" :  "Cresent Street", "current" : "234,Bald Hill Street" }, "unit"  : "MongoDB" } { "_id" : 1003, "name" : "James", "address" : { "previous" :  "Cresent Street", "current" : "234,Hill Street" }, "unit" :  "Spark" } >   Working with Arrays In MongoDB, we can specify field values as an array.  48   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   Recipe 2-10. Working with Arrays In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to query an array.   Problem You want to query an array.   Solution The following command is used to query an array.  db.collection.find     How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to query embedded documents.   Step 1: Match an Array  Execute the code shown here to create the employeedetails collection  under the employee database.  db.employeedetails.insertMany [     { name: "John", projects: ["MongoDB", "Hadoop","Spark"],   scores:[25,28,29] }, { name: "James", projects: [  "Cassandra","Spark"], scores:[26,24,23]}, { name: "Smith",  projects: [ "Hadoop","MongoDB"], scores:[22,28,26]} ]    To specify an equality condition on an array, you need to specify   the exact array to match in the   of the query document  { : }.  49   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  To select all documents where the projects value is an array with   exactly two elements, "Hadoop" and "MongoDB", in the specified order, use  the following commands.  db.employeedetails.find  { projects: ["Hadoop", "MongoDB"] }    Here is the output,  > db.employeedetails.find  { projects: ["Hadoop", "MongoDB"] }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f072a" , "name" :  "Smith", "projects" : [ "Hadoop", "MongoDB" ], "scores" : [ 22,  28, 26 ] } >   Step 2: Query an Array for an Element  To query all documents where projects is an array that contains the string  "MongoDB" as one of its elements, execute the following command.  db.employeedetails.find  { projects: "MongoDB" }    Here is the output,  > db.employeedetails.find  { projects: "MongoDB" }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f0728" , "name" :  "John", "projects" : [ "MongoDB", "Hadoop", "Spark" ], "scores"  : [ 25, 28, 29 ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f072a" , "name" : "Smith",   "projects" : [ "Hadoop", "MongoDB" ], "scores" : [ 22, 28, 26 ] } >  50   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   Step 3: Specify Query Operators  To query all documents where the scores field is an array that contains at  least one element whose value is greater than 26 we can use the $gt operator.  db.employeedetails.find  { scores:{$gt:26} }    Here is the output,  > db.employeedetails.find  { scores:{$gt:26} }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f0728" , "name" :  "John", "projects" : [ "MongoDB", "Hadoop", "Spark" ], "scores"  : [ 25, 28, 29 ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f072a" , "name" : "Smith",   "projects" : [ "Hadoop", "MongoDB" ], "scores" : [ 22, 28, 26 ] } >   Step 4: Query an Array with Compound Filter  Conditions on the Array Elements  A compound filter condition on the array can be specified as shown here.  db.employeedetails.find  { scores: { $gt: 20, $lt: 24 } }    Here is the output,  > db.employeedetails.find  { scores: { $gt: 20, $lt: 24 } }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f0729" , "name" :  "James", "projects" : [ "Cassandra", "Spark" ], "scores" :   [ 26, 24, 23 ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f072a" , "name" :  "Smith", "projects" : [ "Hadoop", "MongoDB" ], "scores" :   [ 22, 28, 26 ] } >  51   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here, one element of the scores array can satisfy the greater than 20   condition and another element can satisfy the less than 24 condition, or a  single element can satisfy both the conditions.   Step 5: Using the $elemMatch operator  The $elemMatch operator allows us to specify multiple conditions on the  array elements such that at least one array element should satisfy all of the  specified conditions.  db.employeedetails.find  { scores: { $elemMatch: { $gt: 23,  $lt: 27 } } }    Here is the output,  > db.employeedetails.find  { scores: { $elemMatch: { $gt: 23,  $lt: 27 } } }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f0728" , "name" :  "John", "projects" : [ "MongoDB", "Hadoop", "Spark" ], "scores"  : [ 25, 28, 29 ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f0729" , "name" : "James",   "projects" : [ "Cassandra", "Spark" ], "scores" : [ 26, 24, 23 ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f072a" , "name" : "Smith",   "projects" : [ "Hadoop", "MongoDB" ], "scores" : [ 22, 28, 26 ] } >   Step 6: Query an Array Element by Index Position  Use dot notation to query an array element by its index position.  Use this code to select all documents where the third element in the   scores array is greater than 26.  db.employeedetails.find  { "scores.2": { $gt: 26 } }    52   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  > db.employeedetails.find  { "scores.2": { $gt: 26 } }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f0728" , "name" :  "John", "projects" : [ "MongoDB", "Hadoop", "Spark" ], "scores"  : [ 25, 28, 29 ] } >   Step 7: Using the $size Operator  You can use the $size operator to query an array by number of elements. To select all documents where the projects array has two elements,   use this code.  Here is the output,  db.employeedetails.find  { "projects": { $size: 2 } }    > db.employeedetails.find  { "projects": { $size: 2 } }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f0729" , "name" :  "James", "projects" : [ "Cassandra", "Spark" ], "scores" : [  26, 24, 23 ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "5badcbd5f10ab299920f072a" , "name" :  "Smith", "projects" : [ "Hadoop", "MongoDB" ], "scores" : [ 22,  28, 26 ] }   Step 8: Using the $push Operator  You can use the $push operator to add a value to an array.  To add work location details, use this code.  db.employeedetails.update {name:"James"},{$push:{Location: "US"}}   53   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the query to check the result:  > db.employeedetails.find {name:"James"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5c04bef3540e90478dd92f4e" , "name" :  "James", "projects" : [ "Cassandra", "Spark" ], "scores" :   [ 26, 24, 23 ], "Location" : [ "US" ] }  To append multiple values to an array, use the $each operator.  db.employeedetails.update {name: "Smith"},{$push:{Location:{$ea ch:["US","UK"]}}}   Here is the query to check the result:  > db.employeedetails.find {name:"Smith"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5c04bef3540e90478dd92f4f" , "name" :  "Smith", "projects" : [ "Hadoop", "MongoDB" ], "scores" : [ 22,  28, 26 ], "Location" : [ "US", "UK" ] } >   Step 9: Using the $addToSet Operator  You can use the $addToSet operator to add a value to an array. $addToSet  adds a value to an array only if a value is not present. If a value is present, it  does not do anything.  To add hobbies to the employeedetails collection, use this code.  db.employeedetails.update  {name: "James"},  { $addToSet:  {hobbies: [ "drawing", "dancing"]} }   54   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the query to check the result:  > db.employeedetails.find {name:"James"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5c04bef3540e90478dd92f4e" , "name" : "James",   "projects" : [ "Cassandra", "Spark" ], "scores" : [ 26, 24, 23 ],   "Location" : [ "US" ], "hobbies" : [ [ "drawing", "dancing" ] ] } >   Step 10: Using the $pop Operator  You can use the $pop operator to remove the first or last element of an array.  To remove the first element in the scores array, use this code.  db.employeedetails.update  {name: "James"},{ $pop:  {scores:-1}}   Here is the query to check the result:  > db.employeedetails.find {name:"James"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5c04bef3540e90478dd92f4e" , "name" :  "James", "projects" : [ "Cassandra", "Spark" ], "scores" : [  24, 23 ], "Location" : [ "US" ], "hobbies" : [ [ "drawing",  "dancing" ] ] } >  To remove the last element in the scores array, use this code.  db.employeedetails.update  {name: "James"},{ $pop: {scores:1}}   Here is the query to check the result:  > db.employeedetails.find {name:"James"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5c04bef3540e90478dd92f4e" , "name" :  "James", "projects" : [ "Cassandra", "Spark" ], "scores" : [ 24 ],   "Location" : [ "US" ], "hobbies" : [ [ "drawing", "dancing" ] ] } >  55   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   Recipe 2-11. Query an Array of Embedded  Documents In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to query an array of embedded  documents.   Problem You want to query an array of embedded documents.   Solution The following command is used to query an array of embedded  documents.  db.collection.find     How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to query an array of embedded  documents.   Step 1: Query for a Document Nested in an Array  Execute the following code to create a student database and studentmarks  collection.  > use student  > db.studentmarks.insertMany [{name:"John",marks:[{cla ss: "II", total: 489},{ class: "III", total: 490 }]},{name:  "James",marks:[{class: "III", total: 469 },{class: "IV",  total: 450}]},{name:"Jack",marks:[{class:"II", total: 489 },{   56   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  class: "III", total: 390}]},{name:"Smith", marks:[{class:  "III", total: 489}, {class: "IV", total: 490}]},  {name:"Joshi",marks:[{class: "II", total: 465}, { class: "III",  total: 470}]}]   The command shown here selects all documents in the array field   marks that match the specified document.  db.studentmarks.find  { "marks": {class: "II", total: 489}}   Here is the output,  > db.studentmarks.find  { "marks": {class: "II", total: 489}}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5bae10e6f10ab299920f073f" , "name" :  "John", "marks" : [ { "class" : "II", "total" : 489 }, {  "class" : "III", "total" : 490 } ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "5bae10e6f10ab299920f0741" , "name" : "Jack",   "marks" : [ { "class" : "II", "total" : 489 }, { "class" :  "III", "total" : 390 } ] } >  Note  equality matching on the array of an embedded document  requires an exact match of the specified document, including field order.   Step 2: Query for a Field Embedded in an Array  of Documents  You can use dot notation to query a field embedded in an array of  documents. The following command selects all documents in the marks  array where at least one embedded document contains the field total that  has a value that is less than 400.  db.studentmarks.find  { 'marks.total': { $lt: 400 } }    57   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  > db.studentmarks.find  { 'marks.total': { $lt: 400 } }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5bae10e6f10ab299920f0741" , "name" :  "Jack", "marks" : [ { "class" : "II", "total" : 489 }, {  "class" : "III", "total" : 390 } ] } >   Step 3: Array Index to Query for a Field  in the Embedded Document  The command shown here selects all the documents in the marks array  where the first element of the document contains the field class, which  has a value that is equal to "II".  db.studentmarks.find  { 'marks.0.class': "II" }    Here is the output,  > db.studentmarks.find  { 'marks.0.class': "II" }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5bae10e6f10ab299920f073f" , "name" :  "John", "marks" : [ { "class" : "II", "total" : 489 },   { "class" : "III", "total" : 490 } ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "5bae10e6f10ab299920f0741" , "name" :  "Jack", "marks" : [ { "class" : "II", "total" : 489 },   { "class" : "III", "total" : 390 } ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "5bae10e6f10ab299920f0743" , "name" :  "Joshi", "marks" : [ { "class" : "II", "total" : 465 },   { "class" : "III", "total" : 470 } ] } >  58   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   Project Fields to Return from Query By default, queries in MongoDB return all fields in matching documents.  You can restrict the fields to be returned using a projection document. Execute the following code to create a studentdetails collection   under the student database.  db.studentdetails.insertMany  [ {name: "John", result: "pass",  marks: { english: 25, maths: 23, science: 25 }, grade: [ {  class: "A", total: 73 } ] },{name: "James", result: "pass",  marks: { english: 24, maths: 25, science: 25 }, grade: [ {  class: "A", total: 74 } ] },{name: "James", result: "fail",  marks: { english: 12, maths: 13, science: 15 }, grade: [ {  class: "C", total: 40 } ] }]    Recipe 2-12. Restricting the Fields Returned  from a Query In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to restrict the fields to return  from a query.   Problem You want to restrict the fields to return from a query.   Solution The following command is used to restrict the fields to return from a query.  db.collection.find    59    MongoDB CrUD operations  Chapter 2   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to restrict the fields to return from a  query.   Step 1: Return the Specified Fields and the _id   Field Only  You can project the required fields by setting the   value to 1 in the  projection document.  The command shown here returns only the _id, marks, and result   fields where name equals "John" in the result set.  db.studentdetails.find  { name: "John" }, { marks: 1, result: 1  }    Here is the output,  > db.studentdetails.find  { name: "John" }, { marks: 1, result:  1 }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5bae3ed2f10ab299920f0744" , "result" :  "pass", "marks" : { "english" : 25, "maths" : 23, "science" :  25 } } >   Step 2: Suppress the _id Field  You can suppress the _id field by setting its exclusion   to 0 in the  projection document.  The following command suppresses the _id field in the result set.  db.studentdetails.find  { name: "John" }, { marks: 1, result:  1,_id:0 }    60   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  > db.studentdetails.find  { name: "John" }, { marks: 1, result:  1,_id:0 }   { "result" : "pass", "marks" : { "english" : 25, "maths" : 23,  "science" : 25 } } >   Step 3: Exclude More Than One Field  You can exclude fields by setting   to 0 in the projection document.  The following command suppresses the _id and result fields in the   db.studentdetails.find  { name: "John" }, { result:0,_id:0 }    result set.  Here is the output,  > db.studentdetails.find  { name: "John" }, { result:0,_id:0 }    { "name" : "John", "marks" : { "english" : 25, "maths" : 23,  "science" : 25 }, "grade" : [ { "class" : "A", "total" : 73 } ]  } >   Step 4: Return a Specific Field in an Embedded  Document  You can use dot notation to refer to the embedded field and set the    to 1 in the projection document.  Here is an example:  db.studentdetails.find  { name: "John }, { result:1, grade: 1,  "marks.english": 1 }   61   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  Here is the output,  > db.studentdetails.find  { name: "John" }, { result:1, grade:  1, "marks.english": 1 }  { "_id" : ObjectId "5bae3ed2f10ab299920f0744" , "result" : "pass",   "marks" : { "english" : 25 }, "grade" : [ { "class" : "A",  "total" : 73 } ] } >   Query for Null or Missing Fields Execute the following code to create the sample collection.  db.sample.insertMany [ { _id: 1, name: null }, { _id: 2 }]    Recipe 2-13. To Query Null or Missing Fields In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to query null or missing values  in MongoDB.   Problem You want to query null or missing values.   Solution The following command is used to query null or missing values.  db.collection.find    62   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to query null or missing values.   Step 1: Equality Filter  The {name:null} query matches documents that either contain the name  field with a value of null or do not contain the name field.  db.sample.find  { name: null }    Here is the output,  > db.sample.insertMany [{ _id: 1, name: null }, { _id: 2 }]  { "acknowledged" : true, "insertedIds" : [ 1, 2 ] } >  Here, it returns both the documents.   Step 2: Type Check  The query shown here returns the documents that only contain the name  field with a value of null. In BSON, set the null value to 10.  db.sample.find  { name: { $type: 10 } }    Here is the output,  > db.sample.find  { name: { $type: 10 } }   { "_id" : 1, "name" : null } >  63   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   Step 3: Existence Check  You can use the $exist operator to check for the existence of a field.  The following query returns the documents that do not contain the   name field.  Here is the output,  db.sample.find  { name: { $exists: false } }    > db.sample.find  { name: { $exists: false } }   { "_id" : 2 } >   Iterate a Cursor The db.collection.find   method of MongoDB returns a cursor. You  need to iterate a cursor to access the documents. You can manually iterate  a cursor in the mongo shell by assigning a cursor returned from the find    method to a variable using the var keyword.  If you are not assigning a cursor to a variable using the var keyword, it   is automatically iterated up to 20 times to print the first 20 documents.   Recipe 2-14. Iterate a Cursor In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to iterate a cursor in the mongo shell.   Problem You want to iterate a cursor in the mongo shell.  64   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations   Solution The following syntax is used to iterate a cursor.  var myCursor = db.collection.find   myCursor   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to iterate a cursor. First, create a  numbers collection.  db.numbers.insert {_id:1,number:1} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:2,number:2} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:3,number:3} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:4,number:4} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:5,number:5} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:6,number:6} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:7,number:7} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:8,number:8} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:9,number:9} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:10,number:10} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:11,number:11} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:12,number:12} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:13,number:13} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:14,number:14} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:15,number:15} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:16,number:16} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:17,number:17} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:18,number:18} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:19,number:19} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:20,number:20} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:21,number:21} ;  65   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  db.numbers.insert {_id:22,number:22} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:23,number:23} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:24,number:24} ; db.numbers.insert {_id:25,number:25} ;  Issue the following commands to iterate a cursor.  var myCursor = db.numbers.find   myCursor  Here is the output,  > var myCursor = db.numbers.find   > myCursor { "_id" : 1, "number" : 1 } { "_id" : 2, "number" : 2 } { "_id" : 3, "number" : 3 } { "_id" : 4, "number" : 4 } { "_id" : 5, "number" : 5 } { "_id" : 6, "number" : 6 } { "_id" : 7, "number" : 7 } { "_id" : 8, "number" : 8 } { "_id" : 9, "number" : 9 } { "_id" : 10, "number" : 10 } { "_id" : 11, "number" : 11 } { "_id" : 12, "number" : 12 } { "_id" : 13, "number" : 13 } { "_id" : 14, "number" : 14 } { "_id" : 15, "number" : 15 } { "_id" : 16, "number" : 16 } { "_id" : 17, "number" : 17 } { "_id" : 18, "number" : 18 } { "_id" : 19, "number" : 19 }  66   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  You can also use the cursor method next   to access the document.  { "_id" : 20, "number" : 20 } Type "it" for more  > it { "_id" : 21, "number" : 21 } { "_id" : 22, "number" : 22 } { "_id" : 23, "number" : 23 } { "_id" : 24, "number" : 24 } { "_id" : 25, "number" : 25 } >  var myCursor=db.numbers.find {} ; while myCursor.hasNext   {   print tojson myCursor.next    ; }  Here is the output,  > var myCursor=db.numbers.find {} ; > while myCursor.hasNext   { ... print tojson myCursor.next    ; ... } { "_id" : 1, "number" : 1 } { "_id" : 2, "number" : 2 } { "_id" : 3, "number" : 3 } { "_id" : 4, "number" : 4 } { "_id" : 5, "number" : 5 } { "_id" : 6, "number" : 6 } { "_id" : 7, "number" : 7 } { "_id" : 8, "number" : 8 } { "_id" : 9, "number" : 9 } { "_id" : 10, "number" : 10 }  67   Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  { "_id" : 11, "number" : 11 } { "_id" : 12, "number" : 12 }  { "_id" : 13, "number" : 13 } { "_id" : 14, "number" : 14 } { "_id" : 15, "number" : 15 } { "_id" : 16, "number" : 16 } { "_id" : 17, "number" : 17 } { "_id" : 18, "number" : 18 } { "_id" : 19, "number" : 19 } { "_id" : 20, "number" : 20 } { "_id" : 21, "number" : 21 } { "_id" : 22, "number" : 22 } { "_id" : 23, "number" : 23 } { "_id" : 24, "number" : 24 } { "_id" : 25, "number" : 25 } >  document.  var myCursor = db.numbers.find   myCursor.forEach printjson ;  > var myCursor = db.numbers.find   > myCursor.forEach printjson ; { "_id" : 1, "number" : 1 } { "_id" : 2, "number" : 2 } { "_id" : 3, "number" : 3 } { "_id" : 4, "number" : 4 } { "_id" : 5, "number" : 5 } { "_id" : 6, "number" : 6 } { "_id" : 7, "number" : 7 }  68  You can also use forEach to iterate the cursor and access the    Chapter 2    MongoDB CrUD operations  { "_id" : 8, "number" : 8 } { "_id" : 9, "number" : 9 } { "_id" : 10, "number" : 10 } { "_id" : 11, "number" : 11 } { "_id" : 12, "number" : 12 } { "_id" : 13, "number" : 13 } { "_id" : 14, "number" : 14 } { "_id" : 15, "number" : 15 } { "_id" : 16, "number" : 16 } { "_id" : 17, "number" : 17 } { "_id" : 18, "number" : 18 } { "_id" : 19, "number" : 19 } { "_id" : 20, "number" : 20 } { "_id" : 21, "number" : 21 } { "_id" : 22, "number" : 22 } { "_id" : 23, "number" : 23 } { "_id" : 24, "number" : 24 } { "_id" : 25, "number" : 25 } >   Working with the limit   and skip    Methods The limit   method is used to limit the number of documents in  the query results and the skip   method skips the given number of  documents in the query result.

In this chapter, we cover the following topics.     Data models.     Data model relationship between documents.     Modeling tree structures.     Aggregation operations.     SQL aggregation terms and corresponding MongoDB   aggregation operations.   Data Models MongoDB provides two data model designs for data modeling:     Embedded data models.     Normalized data models.    Subhashini Chellappan and Dharanitharan Ganesan 2020  S. Chellappan and D. Ganesan, MongoDB Recipes,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4891-1_3  79    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Chapter 3   Embedded Data Models In MongoDB, you can embed related data in a single document. This  schema design is known as denormalized models. Consider the example  shown in Figure 3-1.  {  _id: 10001,  studName:"John",  marks: {  english:24  maths:25      science:23  }  }  Embedded   sub document  Figure 3-1.  A denormalized model  This embedded document model allows applications to store   the related piece of information in the same records. As a result, the  application requires only few queries and updates to complete common  operations.  We can use embedded documents to represent both one-to-one   relationships  a “contains” relationship between two entities  and one-to-  many relationships  when many documents are viewed in the context of  one parent .  Embedded documents provide better results in these cases:     For read operations.     When we need to retrieve related data in a single   database operation.  Embedded data models update related data in a single atomic   operation. Embedded document data can be accessed using dot notation.  80   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation   Normalized Data Models Normalized data models describe relationships using references, as  illustrated in Figure 3-2.  Figure 3-2.  Normalized data model  Normalized data models can best be used in the following   circumstances:  of data.     When embedding data model results duplication       To represent complex many-to-many relationships.     To model large hierarchical data sets.  Normalized data models do not provide good read performance.   Data Model Relationship Between Documents Let’s explore a data model that uses an embedded document and references.   Recipe 3-1. Data Model Using an Embedded  Document In this recipe, we are going to discuss a data model using an embedded  document.  81    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Chapter 3   Problem You want to create a data model for a one-to-one relationship.   Solution Use an embedded document.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to design a data model for a one-to-  one relationship.   Step 1: One-to-One Relationships  Consider this example.  {    _id: "James",    name: "James William" }  {    student_id: "James",    street: "123 Hill Street",    city: "New York",    state: "US",  }  Here, we have student and address relationships in which an address   belongs to the student. If we are going to retrieve address data with the  name frequently, then referencing requires multiple queries to resolve  references. In this scenario, we can embed address data with the student  data to provide a better data model, as shown here.  82   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  {    _id: "James",    name: "James William",    address: {               street: "123 Hill Street",               city: "New York",               state: "US",               } }  With this data model, we can retrieve complete student information   with one query.   Step 2: One-to-Many Relationships  Consider this example.  {    _id: "James",    name: "James William" }  {    student_id: "James",    street: "123 Hill Street",    city: "New York",    state: "US",  }  {    student_id: "James",    street: "234 Thomas Street",    city: "New Jersey",    state: "US",  }  83   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Here, we have a student and multiple address relationships  a student   has multiple addresses . If we are going to retrieve address data with the  name frequently, then referencing requires multiple queries to resolve  references. In this scenario, the optimal way to design the schema is to  embed address data with the student data as shown here.  {    _id: "James",    name: "James William",    address: [{               street: "123 Hill Street",               city: "New York",               state: "US",               },             {               street: "234 Thomas Street",               city: "New Jersey",               state: "US",              }]  }  This data model allows us to retrieve complete student information   with one query.   Recipe 3-2. Data Model Using Document  References In this recipe, we are going to discuss a data model using document  references.  84   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation   Problem You want to create a data model for a one-to-many relationship.   Solution Use a document reference.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to design a data model for a one-to-  many relationship.   Step 1: One-to-Many Relationships  Consider the following data model that maps a publisher and book  relationship.  {    title: "Practical Apache Spark",    author: [ "Subhashini Chellappan", "Dharanitharan Ganesan" ],    published_date: ISODate "2018-11-30" ,    pages: 300,    language: "English",    publisher: {               name: "Apress",               founded: 1999,               location: "US"             } }  85   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  {    title: "MongoDB Recipes",    author: [ "Subhashini Chellappan"],    published_date: ISODate "2018-11-30" ,    pages: 120,    language: "English",    publisher: {               name: "Apress",               founded: 1999,               location: "US"             } }  Here, the publisher document is embedded inside the book document,   which leads to repetition of the publisher data model.  In this scenario, we can document references to avoid repetition of  data. In document references, the growth of relationships determines  where to store the references. If the number of books per publisher is  small, then we can store the book reference inside the publisher document  as shown here.  {    name: "Apress",    founded: 1999,    location: "US",    books: [123456, 456789, ...] }  {     _id: 123456,     title: "Practical Apache Spark",     author: [ "Subhashini Chellappan", "Dharanitharan Ganesan"  ],  86   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation      published_date: ISODate "2018-11-30" ,     pages: 300,     language: "English"  {    _id: 456789,    title: "MongoDB Recipes",    author: [ "Subhashini Chellappan"],    published_date: ISODate "2018-11-30" ,    pages: 120,    language: "English" }  }  }  {    _id:"Apress",    name: "Apress",    founded: 1999,    location: "US"  If the number of books per publisher is unbounded, this data model   would lead to mutable, growing arrays. We can avoid this situation by  storing the publisher reference inside the book document as shown here.  {    _id: 123456,    title: "Practical Apache Spark",    author: [ "Subhashini Chellappan", "Dharanitharan Ganesan" ],    published_date: ISODate "2018-11-30" ,    pages: 300,  87   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation     language: "English",    publisher_id: "Apress" }  {    _id: 456789,    title: "MongoDB Recipes",    author: [ "Subhashini Chellappan"],    published_date: ISODate "2018-11-30" ,    pages: 120,    language: "English",    publisher_id: "Apress" }   Step 2: Query Document References  Let’s discuss how to query document references. Consider the following  collections.  db.publisher.insert {_id:"Apress",name: "Apress", founded:  1999,location:"US"}   db.authors.insertMany [{_id: 123456,title: "Practical Apache  Spark",author:["Subhashini Chellappan", "Dharanitharan Ganesan"  ], published_date: ISODate "2018-11-30" ,pages: 300,language:  "English",publisher_id: "Apress"},{_id: 456789,title: "MongoDB  Recipes",  author: [ "Subhashini  Chellappan"],published_ date: ISODate "2018-11-30" ,  pages: 120,language:  "English",publisher_id: "Apress"}]   To perform a left outer join, use $lookup as shown here.  db.publisher.aggregate [{$lookup:{from:"authors",localField:"_id", foreignField:"publisher_id",as:"authors_docs"}}]   88   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Here is the output,  > db.publisher.aggregate [{$lookup:{from:"authors",localFie ld:"_id", ... foreignField:"publisher_id",as:"authors_docs"}}]  { "_id" : "Apress", "name" : "Apress", "founded" : 1999,  "location" : "US", "authors_docs" : [ { "_id" : 123456,  "title" : "Practical Apache Spark", "author" : [ "Subhashini  Chellappan", "Dharanitharan Ganesan" ], "published_date" :  ISODate "2018-11-30T00:00:00Z" , "pages" : 300, "language"  : "English", "publisher_id" : "Apress" }, { "_id" : 456789,  "title" : "MongoDB Recipes", "author" : [ "Subhashini  Chellappan" ], "published_date" : ISODate "2018-11-  30T00:00:00Z" , "pages" : 120, "language" : "English",  "publisher_id" : "Apress" } ] } >   Modeling Tree Structures Let’s look at a data model that describes a tree-like structure.   Recipe 3-3. Model Tree Structure  with Parent References In this recipe, we are going to discuss a tree structure data model using  parent references.   Problem You want to create a data model for a tree structure with parent references.  89    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Chapter 3   Solution Use the parent references pattern.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to design a data model for a tree  structure with parent references.   Step 1: Tree Structure with Parent References  The parent references pattern stores each tree node in a document; in  addition to the tree node, the document stores the _id of the node’s parent.  Consider the following author tree model with parent references.  db.author.insert  { _id: "Practical Apache Spark", parent:  "Books" }   db.author.insert  { _id: "MongoDB Recipes", parent: "Books" }   db.author.insert  { _id: "Books", parent: "Subhashini" }   db.author.insert  { _id: "A Framework For Extracting  Information From Web Using VTD-XML ' s XPath", parent:  "Article" }   db.author.insert  { _id: "Article", parent: "Subhashini" }   db.author.insert  { _id: "Subhashini", parent: null }    The tree structure of this author collection is shown in Figure 3-3.  90   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Figure 3-3.  Tree structure for the author collection  The following command retrieves the parent of a node MongoDB   Recipes.  Here is the output,  db.author.findOne  { _id: "MongoDB Recipes" }  .parent  > db.author.findOne  { _id: "MongoDB Recipes" }  .parent Books >  The next command retrieves the immediate children of the parent.  db.author.find  { parent: "Subhashini" }    Here is the output,  > db.author.find  { parent: "Subhashini" }   { "_id" : "Books", "parent" : "Subhashini" } { "_id" : "Article", "parent" : "Subhashini" } >  91   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation   Step 2: Tree Structure with Child References  The child references pattern stores each tree node in a document; in  addition to the tree node, the document stores in an array the _id value s   of the node’s children.  Consider the following author tree model with child references.  db.author.insert  { _id: "Practical Apache Spark", children: [] }   db.author.insert  { _id: "MongoDB", children: [] }   db.author.insert  { _id: "Books", children: [ "Practical Apache  Spark", "MongoDB Recipes" ] }   db.author.insert  { _id: " A Framework For Extracting  Information From Web Using VTD-XML ' s XPath ", children: [] }   db.author.insert  { _id: "Article", children: [ " A Framework For  Extracting Information From Web Using VTD-XML ' s XPath " ] }   db.categories.insert  { _id: "Subhashini", children: [  "Books","Article" ] }    The following command retrieves the immediate children of node Books.  db.author.findOne  { _id: "Books" }  .children  Here is the output,  > db.author.findOne  { _id: "Books" }  .children [ "Practical Apache Spark", "MongoDB Recipes" ] >  The next command retrieves the MongoDB Recipes parent node and its   db.author.find  { children: "MongoDB Recipes" }    siblings.  92   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Here is the output,  > db.author.find  { children: "MongoDB Recipes" }   { "_id" : "Books", "children" : [ "Practical Apache Spark",  "MongoDB Recipes" ] } >  Child references are a good choice to work with tree storage when   there are no subtree operations.   Step 3: Tree Structure with an Array of Ancestors  The array of ancestors pattern stores each tree node in a document; in  addition to the tree node, the document stores in an array the _id value s   of the node’s ancestors or path.  Consider this author tree model with an array of ancestors.  db.author.insert  { _id: "Practical Apache Spark", ancestors: [  "Subhashini", "Books" ], parent: "Books" }   db.author.insert  { _id: "MongoDB Recipes", ancestors: [  "Subhashini", "Books" ], parent: "Books" }   db.author.insert  { _id: "Books", ancestors: [ "Subhashini" ],  parent: "Subhashini" }   db.author.insert  { _id: " A Framework For Extracting  Information From Web Using VTD-XML ", ancestors: [  "Subhashini", "Article" ], parent: "Article" }   db.author.insert  { _id: "Article", ancestors: [ "Subhashini"  ], parent: "Subhashini" }   db.author.insert  { _id: "Subhashini", ancestors: [ ], parent:  null }    The array of ancestors field stores the ancestors field and reference to   the immediate parent.  93   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  To retrieve the ancestors, use this command.  db.author.findOne  { _id: "MongoDB Recipes" }  .ancestors  Here is the output,  > db.author.findOne  { _id: "MongoDB Recipes" }  .ancestors [ "Subhashini", "Books" ] >  Use this command to find all its descendants.  db.author.find  { ancestors: "Subhashini" }    Here is the output,  > db.author.find  { ancestors: "Subhashini" }   { "_id" : "Practical Apache Spark", "ancestors" : [  "Subhashini", "Books" ], "parent" : "Books" } { "_id" : "MongoDB Recipes", "ancestors" : [ "Subhashini",  "Books" ], "parent" : "Books" } { "_id" : "Books", "ancestors" : [ "Subhashini" ], "parent" :  "Subhashini" } { "_id" : " A Framework For Extracting Information From Web  Using VTD-XML ", "ancestors" : [ "Subhashini", "Article" ],  "parent" : "Article" } { "_id" : "Article", "ancestors" : [ "Subhashini" ], "parent" :  "Subhashini" } >  This pattern provides an efficient solution to find all descendants and  the ancestors of a node. The array of ancestors pattern is a good choice for  working with subtrees.  94   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation   Aggregation Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents and can  perform variety of operations on the grouped values to return a single  result. MongoDB provides following aggregation operations:     Aggregation pipeline.     Map-reduce function.     Single-purpose aggregation methods.   Aggregation Pipeline The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation. It is modeled  based on the concept of data processing pipelines. Pipelines execute  an operation on some input and use that output as an input to the next  operation. Documents enter a multistage pipeline that transforms them  into an aggregated result.   Recipe 3-4. Aggregation Pipeline In this recipe, we are going to discuss how the aggregation pipeline works.   Problem You want to work with aggregation functions.   Solution Use this method.  db.collection.aggregate    95    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Chapter 3   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to work with the aggregation pipeline.   Step 1: Aggregation Pipeline  Execute the following orders collection to perform aggregation.  db.orders.insertMany [{custID:"10001",amount:500,status:"A"},{c ustID:"10001",amount:250,status:"A"},{custID:"10002",amount:200 ,status:"A"},{custID:"10001",amount: 300, status:"D"}] ;  To project only customer IDs, use this syntax.  db.orders.aggregate  [ { $project : { custID : 1 , _id : 0 } } ]    Here is the output,  > db.orders.aggregate  [ { $project : { custID : 1 , _id : 0 }  } ]   { "custID" : "10001" } { "custID" : "10001" } { "custID" : "10002" } { "custID" : "10001" } >  To group on custID and compute the sum of amount use the following   db.orders.aggregate {$group:{_id:"$custID",TotalAmount:{$sum:"$ amount"}}} ;  In the preceding example, the value of the variable is accessed by using   command.  the $ sign.  96   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Here is the output,  > db.orders.aggregate {$group:{_id:"$custID",TotalAmount:{$sum: "$amount"}}} ; { "_id" : "10002", "TotalAmount" : 200 } { "_id" : "10001", "TotalAmount" : 1050 } >  To filter on status: "A" and then group it on "custID" and compute   the sum of amount, use the following command.  db.orders.aggregate {$match:{status:"A"}},{$group:  {_id:"$custID",TotalAmount:{ $sum:"$amount"}}} ;  Here is the ouput:  >db.orders.aggregate {$match:{status:"A"}},{$group:  {_id:"$custID",TotalAmount:{ $sum:"$amount"}}} ; { "_id" : "10002", "TotalAmount" : 200 } { "_id" : "10001", "TotalAmount" : 750 } >  To group on "custID" and compute the average of the amount for each   group, use this command.  db.orders.aggregate {$group:{_id:"$custID",AverageAmount:  {$avg:"$amount"}}} ;  Here is the output,  > db.orders.aggregate {$group:{_id:"$custID",AverageAmount:  {$avg:"$amount"}}} ; { "_id" : "10002", "AverageAmount" : 200 } { "_id" : "10001", "AverageAmount" : 350 } >  97    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Chapter 3   Map-Reduce MongoDB also provides map-reduce to perform aggregation operations.  There are two phases in map-reduce: a map stage that processes each  document and outputs one or more objects and a reduce stage that  combines the output of the map operation.  A custom JavaScript function is used to perform map and reduce   operations. Map-reduce is less efficient and more complex compared to  the aggregation pipeline.   Recipe 3-5. Map-Reduce In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to perform aggregation  operations using map-reduce.   Problem You want to work with aggregation operations using map-reduce.   Solution Use a customized JavaScript function.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to work with map-reduce.  98   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation   Step 1: Map-Reduce  Execute the following orders collection to perform aggregation operations.  db.orders.insertMany [{custID:"10001",amount:500,status:"A"},{c ustID:"10001",amount:250,status:"A"},{custID:"10002",amount:200 ,status:"A"},{custID:"10001",amount: 300, status:"D"}] ;  To filter on status:"A" and then group it on custID and compute the   sum of amount, use the following map-reduce function.  var reduce = function key, values { return Array.sum values  ; }  Map function:  var map = function  { emit  this.custID, this.amount ;}  Reduce function:  To execute the query:  db.orders.mapReduce map, reduce,{out: "order_ totals",query:{status:"A"}} ;  db.order_totals.find    Here is the output,  > var map = function  { ... emit  this.custID, this.amount ;} > var reduce = function key, values { return Array.sum values   ; } > db.orders.mapReduce map, reduce,{out: "order_ totals",query:{status:"A"}} ; {         "result" : "order_totals",         "timeMillis" : 82,  99   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation          "counts" : {                 "input" : 3,                 "emit" : 3,                 "reduce" : 1,                 "output" : 2         },         "ok" : 1 } > db.order_totals.find   { "_id" : "10001", "value" : 750 } { "_id" : "10002", "value" : 200 } >   Single-Purpose Aggregation Operations MongoDB also provides single-purpose aggregation operations such  as db.collection.count   and db.collection.distinct  . These  aggregate operations aggregate documents from a single collection. This  functionality provides simple access to common aggregation processes.   Recipe 3-6. Single-Purpose Aggregation  Operations In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to use single-purpose  aggregation operations.   Problem You want to work with single-purpose aggregation operations.  100   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation   Solution Use these commands.  db.collection.count   db.collection.distinct     How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to work with single-purpose  aggregation operations.   Step 1: Single-Purpose Aggregation Operations  Execute the following orders collection to perform single-purpose  aggregation operations.  db.orders.insertMany [{custID:"10001",amount:500,status:"A"},{c ustID:"10001",amount:250,status:"A"},{custID:"10002",amount:200 ,status:"A"},{custID:"10001",amount: 300, status:"D"}] ;  Use the following syntax to find a distinct "custID".  db.orders.distinct "custID"   Here is the output,  > db.orders.distinct "custID"  [ "10001", "10002" ] >  101   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  To count the number of documents, use this code.  db.orders.count    Here is the output,  > db.orders.count   4 >   SQL Aggregation Terms and Corresponding  MongoDB Aggregation Operators Table 3-1 shows SQL aggregation terms and their corresponding MongoDB  aggregation operators.

Matching SQL Aggregation  to MongoDB Aggregation Operations In this recipe, we are going to discuss examples of matching MongoDB  operations to equivalent SQL aggregation terms.   Problem You want to understand the equivalent of MongoDB queries for any SQL  queries.   Solution Refer to Table 3-1 and use the equivalent MongoDB operator for a  respective SQL clause.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to understand the MongoDB queries  for certain SQL operations.   Step 1: Converting SQL Aggregation Operations  to MongoDB  Execute the following query to check the details of the orders collection.  > db.orders.find    103   Chapter 3    Data MoDeling anD aggregation  Here is the output,  > db.orders.find   { "_id" : ObjectId "5d636112eea2dccfdeafa522" , "custID" :  "10001", "amount" : 500, "status" : "A" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d636112eea2dccfdeafa523" , "custID" :  "10001", "amount" : 250, "status" : "A" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d636112eea2dccfdeafa524" , "custID" :  "10002", "amount" : 200, "status" : "A" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d636112eea2dccfdeafa525" , "custID" :  "10001", "amount" : 300, "status" : "D" }  Now, let’s find the count of records from the orders colletion. Imagine this is the same as an orders table in any RDBMS and the SQL   to get the count of records from the table is as follows:  SELECT COUNT *  AS count FROM orders  Use the following query to get the count of documents from the   collection in MongoDB.  > db.orders.aggregate  [ { $group: {  _id: null,  count: {  $sum: 1 } } } ]    Here is the output,  > db.orders.aggregate  [ { $group: {  _id: null,  count: {  $sum: 1 } } } ]   { "_id" : null, "count" : 4 }  104   CHAPTER 4  Indexes      Indexes.     Types of indexes.      Index properties.  In Chapter 3, we discussed data modeling patterns and the aggregation  framework. In this chapter, we to discuss the following topics:     The various indexing strategies to be considered.  Indexes are used to improve the performance of the query. Without   indexes, MongoDB must search the entire collection to select those  documents that match the query statement. MongoDB therefore uses  indexes to limit the number of documents that it must scan.  Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of the   collection’s data set in an easy-to-transform format. The index stores a set  of fields ordered by the value of the field. This ordering helps to improve  the performance of equality matches and range-based query operations. MongoDB defines indexes at the collection level and indexes can be  created on any field of the document. MongoDB creates an index for the  _id field by default.  Note  MongoDB creates a default unique index _id field, which  helps to prevent inserting two documents with the same value of the  _id field.    Subhashini Chellappan and Dharanitharan Ganesan 2020  S. Chellappan and D. Ganesan, MongoDB Recipes,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4891-1_4  105   Chapter 4    InDexes   Recipe 4-1. Working with Indexes In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to work with indexes in  MongoDB.   Problem You want to create an index.   Solution Use the following command.  db.collection.createIndex     How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to create an index.  Consider the following employee collection.  db.employee.insert {empId:1,empName:"John",state:"KA",country:" India"}  db.employee.insert {empId:2,empName:"Smith",state:"CA",country: "US"}  db.employee.insert {empId:3,empName:"James",state:"FL",country: "US"}  db.employee.insert {empId:4,empName:"Josh",state:"TN",country:" India"}   db.employee.insert {empId:5,empName:"Joshi",state:"HYD",country :"India"}   106   Chapter 4    InDexes   Step 1: Create an Index  To create single-field index on the empId field, use the following command.  db.employee.createIndex {empId:1}   Here, the parameter value “1” indicates that empId field values will be   To create an index on multiple fields, known as a compound index, use   stored in ascending order. Here is the output,  > db.employee.createIndex {empId:1}  {         "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,         "numIndexesBefore" : 1,         "numIndexesAfter" : 2,         "ok" : 1 } >  this command.  Here is the output,  db.employee.createIndex {empId:1,empName:1}   > db.employee.createIndex {empId:1,empName:1}  {         "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,         "numIndexesBefore" : 2,         "numIndexesAfter" : 3,         "ok" : 1 } >  107   Chapter 4    InDexes  To display a list of indexes, this is the syntax.  db.employee.getIndexes    Here is the output,  > db.employee.getIndexes   [         {                 "v" : 2,                 "key" : {                         "_id" : 1                 },                 "name" : "_id_",                 "ns" : "test.employee"         },         {                 "v" : 2,                 "key" : {                         "empId" : 1                 },                 "name" : "empId_1",                 "ns" : "test.employee"         },         {                 "v" : 2,                 "key" : {                         "empId" : 1,                         "empName" : 1                 },  108   Chapter 4    InDexes                  "name" : "empId_1_empName_1",                 "ns" : "test.employee"         } ] >  To drop a compound index, use the following command.  db.employee.dropIndex {empId:1,empName:1}   Here is the output,  > db.employee.dropIndex {empId:1,empName:1}  { "nIndexesWas" : 3, "ok" : 1 } >  To drop all the indexes, use this command.  db.employee.dropIndexes    Here is the output,  > db.employee.dropIndexes   {         "nIndexesWas" : 2,         "msg" : "non-_id indexes dropped for collection",         "ok" : 1 } >  Note  We can’t drop _id indexes. MongoDB creates an index for the  _id field by default.  109   Chapter 4    InDexes   Recipe 4-2. Index Types In this recipe, we are going to discuss various types of indexes.   Problem You want to create different types of indexes.   Solution Use the following command.  db.collection.createIndex     How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to create the different types of indexes  shown in Figure 4-1.  Types of  Indexes  Single Field Indexes Compound Indexes MultiKey Indexes Text Indexes Hashed Indexes 2dSphere Indexes  Figure 4-1.  Types of indexes  110   Chapter 4    InDexes   Step 1: Multikey Index  Multikey indexes are useful to create an index for a field that holds an array  value. MongoDB creates an index key for each element in the array.  Consider the below collection, you can create if the collection is not   available.  db.employeeproject.insert {empId:1001,empName:"John",projects:[ "Hadoop","MongoDB"]}  db.employeeproject.insert {empId:1002,empName:"James",projects: ["MongoDB","Spark"]}   To create an index on the projects field, use the following command.  db.employeeproject.createIndex {projects:1}   Here is the output,  > db.employeeproject.createIndex {projects:1}  {         "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,         "numIndexesBefore" : 1,         "numIndexesAfter" : 2,         "ok" : 1 }  Note  You can’t create a compound multikey index.   Step 2: Text Indexes  MongoDB provides text indexes to support text search queries on string  content. You can create a text index on a field that takes as its value a string  or an array of string elements.  111   Chapter 4    InDexes  Consider this post collection.  db.post.insert {    "post_text": "Happy Learning",    "tags": [       "mongodb",       "10gen"    ] }   To create text indexes, use the following command.  db.post.createIndex {post_text:"text"}   This command creates a text index for the field post_text.  Here is the output,  > db.post.createIndex {post_text:"text"}  {         "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,         "numIndexesBefore" : 1,         "numIndexesAfter" : 2,         "ok" : 1 } >  To perform a search, use the command shown here.  db.post.find {$text:{$search:"Happy"}}   Here is the output,  > db.post.find {$text:{$search:"Happy"}}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5bb215286d8d957bcedc225e" , "post_text" :  "Happy Learning", "tags" : [ "mongodb", "10gen" ] } >  112   Chapter 4    InDexes   Step 3: Hashed Indexes  The size of the indexes can be reduced with the help of hashed indexes.  Hashed indexes store the hashes of the values of the indexed field. Hashed  indexes support sharding using hashed shard keys. In hashed-based  sharding, a hashed index of a field is used as the shard key to partition data  across the sharded cluster. We discuss sharding in Chapter 5.  To create a hashed-based index on the field userId, use the following   Hashed indexes do not support multikey indexes. Consider the user collection shown here.  db.user.insert {userId:1,userName:"John"}  db.user.insert {userId:2,userName:"James"}  db.user.insert {userId:3,userName:"Jack"}   command.  Here is the output,  db.user.createIndex  { userId: "hashed" }    > db.user.createIndex  { userId: "hashed" }   {         "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,         "numIndexesBefore" : 1,         "numIndexesAfter" : 2,         "ok" : 1 } >  113   Chapter 4    InDexes   Step 4: 2dsphere Index  The 2dsphere index is useful to return queries on geospatial data.  Consider the schools collection given here.  db.schools.insert  {    name: "St.John's School",    location: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.97, 40.77 ] },    }  ; db.schools.insert  {    name: "St.Joseph's School",    location: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.9928, 40.7193 ] },    }  ; db.schools.insert  {    name: "St.Thomas School",    location: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.9375, 40.8303 ] },    }  ;  Use the following syntax to create a 2dsphere index.  db.schools.createIndex  { location : "2dsphere" }    The following code uses the $near operator to return documents that  are at least 500 meters from and at most 1,500 meters from the specified  GeoJSON point.  db.schools.find {location:{$near:{$geometry: { type:  "Point",  coordinates: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ] },$minDistance:  500,$maxDistance: 1500}}}   114   Chapter 4    InDexes  Here is the output,  > db.schools.find {location:{$near:{$geometry: { type:  "Point",  coordinates: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ] },$minDistance:  500,$maxDistance: 1500}}}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5ca47a184b034d4cc1345f45" , "name" : "St. John's School", "location" : { "type" : "Point", "coordinates"  : [ -73.97, 40.77 ] } } >   Recipe 4-3. Index Properties Indexes can also have properties. The index properties define certain  characteristics and behaviors of an indexed field at runtime. For example,  a unique index ensures the indexed fields do not support duplicates. In  this recipe, we are going to discuss various index properties.   Problem You want to work with index properties.   Solution Use this command.  db.collection.createIndex     How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to work with index properties.  115   Chapter 4    InDexes   Step 1: TTL Indexes  Time to Live  TTL  indexes are single-field indexes that are used to  remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of time. Data  expiration is useful for certain types of information such as logs, machine- generated data, and so on.  Consider the sample collection shown here.  db.credit.insert {credit:16}  db.credit.insert {credit:18}  db.credit.insert {credit:12}   To create a TTL index on the field credit, issue the following command.  db.credit.createIndex  { credit: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 35 }  ;  Here is the output,  > db.credit.createIndex  { credit: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds:35  }  ; {         "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,         "numIndexesBefore" : 1,         "numIndexesAfter" : 2,         "ok" : 1 } >   Step 2: Unique Indexes  A unique index ensures that the indexed fields do not contain any duplicate  values. By default, MongoDB creates a unique index on the _id field.  116   Chapter 4    InDexes  Consider the following student collection.  db.student.insert {_id:1,studid:101,studname:"John"}  db.student.insert {_id:2,studid:102,studname:"Jack"}  db.student.insert {_id:3,studid:103,studname:"James"}   To create unique index for the field studId, use this command.  db.student.createIndex {"studid":1}, {unique:true}   Here is the output,  > db.student.createIndex {"studid":1}, {unique:true}  {         "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,         "numIndexesBefore" : 1,         "numIndexesAfter" : 2,         "ok" : 1 } >  When we try to insert the value studid:101,  db.student.insert [{_id:1,studid:101,studname:"John"}]   throws the following error message:  "errmsg" : "E11000 duplicate key error collection: test.student  index: _id_ dup key: { : 1.0 }",   Step 3: Partial Indexes  Partial indexes are useful when you want to index the documents in a  collection that meet a specific filter condition. The filter condition could  be specified using any operators. For example, db.person.find  { age:  { $gt: 15 } }   can be used to find the documents that have an age   117   Chapter 4    InDexes  greater than 15 in the person collection. Partial indexes reduce storage  requirements and performance costs because they store only a subset of  the documents.  Use the db.collection.createIndex   method with the   partialFilterExpression option to create a partial index.  The partialFilterExpression option accepts a document that   specifies the filter condition using:  equality expressions  i.e., field: value or using the $eq  operator .                      $exists: true expression.  $gt, $gte, $lt, and $lte expressions.  $type expressions.  $and operator at the top level only.  Consider the following documents of a person collection.  db.person.insert {personName:"John",age:16}  db.person.insert {personName:"James",age:15}  db.person.insert {personName:"John",hobbies:["sports","music"]}   To index only those documents in the person collection where the   value in the age field is greater than 15, use the following command.  db.person.createIndex   { age: 1},{partialFilterExpression: {  age: { $gt: 15 }}}   The query shown here uses a partial index to return those documents   in the person collection where the age value is greater than 15.  db.person.find  { age: { $gt: 15 } }    118   Chapter 4    InDexes  Here is the output,  > db.person.find  { age: { $gt: 15 } }   { "_id" : ObjectId "5ca453954b034d4cc1345f3b" , "personName" :  "John", "age" : 16 } >   Step 4: Sparse Indexes  Sparse indexes store entries only for the documents that have the indexed  field, even if it contains null values. A sparse index skips any documents  that do not have the indexed field. The index is considered sparse because  it does not include all the documents of a collection.  Consider the following person collection.  db.person.insert {personName:"John",age:16}  db.person.insert {personName:"James",age:15}   db.person.insert {personName:"John",hobbies:["sports","mus ic"]}   To create a sparse index on the age field, issue this command.  db.person.createIndex  { age: 1 }, { sparse: true }  ;  Here is the output,  > db.person.createIndex  { age: 1 }, { sparse: true }  ; {         "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,         "numIndexesBefore" : 1,         "numIndexesAfter" : 2,         "ok" : 1 } >  119   Chapter 4    InDexes  To return all documents in the collection named person using the   index on the age field, use hint    to specify a sparse index.  db.person.find  .hint  { age: 1 }  .count  ;  Here is the output,  > db.person.find  .hint  { age: 1 }  .count  ; 2 >  To perform a correct count, use this code.  db.person.find  .count  ;  Here is the output,  > db.person.find  .count  ; 3 >  Note  partial indexes determine the index entries based on the filter  condition, whereas sparse indexes select the documents based on  the existence of the indexed field.   Recipe 4-4. Indexing Strategies We must follow different strategies to create the right index for our  requirements. In this recipe, we are going to discuss various indexing  strategies.  120   Chapter 4    InDexes   Problem You want to learn about indexing strategies to ensure you are creating the  right type of index for different purposes.   Solution The best indexing strategy is determined by different factors, including     Type of executing query.     Number of read write operations.     Available memory.  Figure 4-2 illustrates the different indexing strategies.  Create Index to support your   Use Index to sort the query   queries  results  INDEXING STRATEGIES  Indexes to fit in RAM, i.e.  Index to cache the recent   values in memory  Indexes to ensure selectivity,  i.e. Queries to limit number   of possible documents  Figure 4-2.  Indexing strategies   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to work with different indexing  strategies.  121   Chapter 4    InDexes   Step 1: Create an Index to Support Your Queries  Creating the right index to support the queries increases the query  execution performance and results in great performance.  Create a single-field index if all the queries use the same single key to   retrieve the documents.  > db.employee.createIndex {empId:1}   Create a multifield compound index if all the queries use more than   one key  multiple filter condition  to retrieve the documents.  > db.employee.createIndex {empId:1,empName:1}    Step 2: Using an Index to Sort the Query Results  Sort operations use indexes for better performance. Indexes determine the  sort order by fetching the documents based on the ordering in the index.  Sorting can be done in the following scenarios:     Sorting with a single-field index.     Sorting on multiple fields.  Sorting with a Single-Field Index  The index can support ascending or descending order on a single field  while retrieving the documents.  > db.employee.createIndex {empId:1}   The preceding index can support ascending order sorting.  > db.employee.find  .sort {empId:1}   122   Chapter 4    InDexes  Here is the output,  MongoDB Enterprise > db.employee.createIndex {empId:1}  {         "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,         "numIndexesBefore" : 1,         "numIndexesAfter" : 2,         "ok" : 1 } MongoDB Enterprise > db.employee.find   { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde439" , "empId" : 1,  "empName" : "John", "state" : "KA", "country" : "India" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43a" , "empId" : 2,  "empName" : "Smith", "state" : "CA", "country" : "US" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43b" , "empId" : 3,  "empName" : "James", "state" : "FL", "country" : "US" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43c" , "empId" : 4,  "empName" : "Josh", "state" : "TN", "country" : "India" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43d" , "empId" : 5,  "empName" : "Joshi", "state" : "HYD", "country" : "India" } MongoDB Enterprise > db.employee.find  .sort {empId:1}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde439" , "empId" : 1,  "empName" : "John", "state" : "KA", "country" : "India" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43a" , "empId" : 2,  "empName" : "Smith", "state" : "CA", "country" : "US" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43b" , "empId" : 3,  "empName" : "James", "state" : "FL", "country" : "US" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43c" , "empId" : 4,  "empName" : "Josh", "state" : "TN", "country" : "India" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43d" , "empId" : 5,  "empName" : "Joshi", "state" : "HYD", "country" : "India" }  123   Chapter 4    InDexes  order.

Sharding.   Replication Replication is the process of creating and managing a duplicate version   of a database across servers to provide redundancy and increase  availability of data.  In MongoDB, replication is achieved with the help of a replica set, a  group of mongod instances that maintain the same data set. A replica set  contains one primary node that is responsible for all write operations and  one or more secondary nodes that replicate the primary’s oplog and apply  the operations to their data sets to reflect the primary’s data set. Figure 5-1  is an illustration of a replica set.    Subhashini Chellappan and Dharanitharan Ganesan 2020  S. Chellappan and D.

Set Up a Replica Set In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to set up a replica set  one  primary and two secondaries  in Windows.   Problem You want to create a replica set.   Solution Use a group of mongod instances.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to set up a three-member replica set.  128   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding   Step 1: Three-Member Replica Set  First, create three data directories:  md c:\mongodb\repset\rs1 md c:\mongodb\repset\rs2 md c:\mongodb\repset\rs3  Here is the output,  c:\>md c:\mongodb\repset\rs1  c:\>md c:\mongodb\repset\rs2  c:\>md c:\mongodb\repset\rs3  Next, start three mongod instances as shown here  see Figures 5-2, 5-4,   and 5-6 .  start mongod --bind_ip hostname --dbpath c:\mongodb\repset\rs1  --port 20001 --replSet myrs  Figure 5-2.  Starting mongod with replica set 1  Note  hostname must be replaced as with ipaddress or  localhost if it is the same local machine.  Refer to Figure 5-3 for a mongod instance that is waiting for connection   on port 20001.  129   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding  Figure 5-3.  mongod instance waiting for connection on port 20001  start mongod --bind_ip hostname --dbpath c:\mongodb\repset\rs2  --port 20002 --replSet myrs  Figure 5-4.  Starting mongod with replica set 2  Refer to Figure 5-5 for a mongod instance that is waiting for connection   on port 20002.  130   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding  Figure 5-5.  mongod instance waiting for connection on port  20002  start mongod --bind_ip hostname --dbpath c:\mongodb\repset\rs3  --port 20003 --replSet myrs  Figure 5-6.  Starting mongod with replica set 3  Refer Figure 5-7 for a mongod instance that is waiting for connection on   port 20002.  131   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding  Figure 5-7.  mongod instance waiting for connection on port 20003  Next, issue the following command to connect to a mongod instance   running on port 20001.  mongo hostname:20001  Figure 5-8 shows the mongo shell that is running on port 20001.  132   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding  Figure 5-8.  Connect to mongo instance on port 20001  Issue the following command in the mongo shell to create a three-   member replica set.  Here is the output,  rs.initiate  ;      to initiate replica set  > rs.initiate  ; {         "info2" :  "no configuration specified. Using a default   configuration for the set",          "me" : "hostname:20001",         "ok" : 1,         "operationTime" : Timestamp 1538362864, 1 ,         "$clusterTime" : {                 "clusterTime" : Timestamp 1538362864, 1 ,                 "signature" : {  133   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding                          "hash" :  BinData 0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAA=" ,                          "keyId" : NumberLong 0                  }         } }  After initiating the replica set, we can add the secondary node by using   this command.  Here is the output,  rs.add "hostname:20002" ;     to add secondary  myrs:SECONDARY> rs.add "hostname:20002" ; {         "ok" : 1,         "operationTime" : Timestamp 1538362927, 1 ,         "$clusterTime" : {                 "clusterTime" : Timestamp 1538362927, 1 ,                 "signature" : {                         "hash" :  BinData 0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAA=" ,                          "keyId" : NumberLong 0                  }         } } myrs:PRIMARY>  Here, the mongod instance running on port 20001 becomes primary. We can add another secondary node by using the following command.  rs.add "hostname:20003" ;       to add secondary  134   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding  Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY>  rs.add "hostname:20003" ; {         "ok" : 1,         "operationTime" : Timestamp 1538362931, 1 ,         "$clusterTime" : {                 "clusterTime" : Timestamp 1538362931, 1 ,                 "signature" : {                         "hash" :  BinData 0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAA=" ,                          "keyId" : NumberLong 0                  }         } } myrs:PRIMARY>  Now, you can check the status of the replica set by issuing the following   command.  rs.status    node.  Next, create a collection named employee using the primary replica    db.employee.insert {_id:10001,name:'Subhashini'} ;  db.employee.insert {_id:10002,name:'Shobana'} ;  Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> db.employee.insert {_ id:10001,name:'Subhashini'} ; WriteResult { "nInserted" : 1 }  myrs:PRIMARY>  db.employee.insert {_id:10002,name:'Shobana'} ; WriteResult { "nInserted" : 1 }  myrs:PRIMARY>  135   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding  Now, connect to the mongo shell running on port 20002 by issuing this   command.  mongo hostname:20002  Here is the output,  myrs:SECONDARY>  Now, issue the following command to find all employees as shown here.  myrs:SECONDARY> db.employee.find   Error: error: {         "operationTime" : Timestamp 1538364766, 1 ,         "ok" : 0,         "errmsg" : "not master and slaveOk=false",         "code" : 13435,         "codeName" : "NotMasterNoSlaveOk",         "$clusterTime" : {                 "clusterTime" : Timestamp 1538364766, 1 ,                 "signature" : {                         "hash" :  BinData 0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAA=" ,                          "keyId" : NumberLong 0                  }         } } myrs:SECONDARY>  The output Error: error: { ........... } shows that we are  getting an error message because we are trying to read data from the  secondary node.  136   Issue the following command to perform a read operation from a   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding  secondary node.  myrs:SECONDARY> rs.slaveOk    myrs:SECONDARY> db.employee.find   { "_id" : 10001, "name" : "Subhashini" } { "_id" : 10002, "name" : "Shobana" }  Next, try to perform a write operation from a secondary node.  myrs:SECONDARY> db.employee.insert {_id:10003,name:"Arunaa MS"}  WriteCommandError {         "operationTime" : Timestamp 1538364966, 1 ,         "ok" : 0,         "errmsg" : "not master",         "code" : 10107,         "codeName" : "NotMaster",         "$clusterTime" : {                 "clusterTime" : Timestamp 1538364966, 1 ,                 "signature" : {                         "hash" :  BinData 0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAA=" ,                          "keyId" : NumberLong 0                  }         } }  myrs:SECONDARY>  In the preceding output, WriteCommandError { ........... } shows   that we are getting an error message because we can’t perform write  operations in a secondary node. We can perform write operations only in  the primary node.  137   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding  All the secondary nodes replicate the primary’s log and apply their  operations to ensure the secondary’s data set reflects the primary’s data  set, as shown in Figure 5-9.

To check the status of free monitoring, use this command.  db.getFreeMonitoringStatus    139   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding   Sharding Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. There  are two methods for addressing system growth: vertical and horizontal  scaling.     Vertical scaling: We need to increase the capacity of  a single server such as using a more powerful CPU,  adding more RAM, or increasing the amount of storage  space.     Horizontal scaling: We need to divide the data set and   distribute the workload across the servers by adding  additional servers to increase the capacity as required.  MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding. A MongoDB   sharded cluster consists of the following components:    1.  Shard: Each shard contains a subset of the sharded   data. Each shard can be deployed as a replica set.    2.  mongos: The mongos acts as a query router, providing   an interface between client applications and the  sharded cluster.    3.  Config servers: Config servers store metadata and   configuration settings for the cluster.   Recipe 5-2. Sharding In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to create sharding to distribute  data across servers.  140   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding   Problem You want to create sharding to distribute data across servers.   Solution The solution is a group of mongod instances.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to set up a sharding.   Step 1: Sharded Cluster  First, create data directories for three shards as shown here.  shard1  shard2  shard3  md c:\shard_data\shard1\data1 md c:\shard_data\shard1\data2 md c:\shard_data\shard1\data3  md c:\shard_data\shard2\data1 md c:\shard_data\shard2\data2 md c:\shard_data\shard2\data3  md c:\shard_data\shard3\data1 md c:\shard_data\shard3\data2 md c:\shard_data\shard3\data3  141   Chapter 5    repliCation and Sharding  Next, start the shards as shown here.  shard1  start mongod.exe --shardsvr --port 26017 --dbpath "c:\shard_ data\shard1\data1" --replSet shard1_replset start mongod.exe --shardsvr --port 26117 --dbpath "c:\shard_ data\shard1\data2" --replSet shard1_replset start mongod.exe --shardsvr --port 26217 --dbpath "c:\shard_ data\shard1\data3" --replSet shard1_replset  Figure 5-12 shows the execution of commands.

Multidocument Transactions in MongoDB In MongoDB, a write operation on single document is atomic, even if  the write operation modifies multiple embedded documents within a  single document. When a single write operation  e.g., db.collection. updateMany    modifies multiple documents, the modification of each  document is atomic, but the operation as a whole is not.  Starting with version 4.0, MongoDB provides multidocument   transactions for replica sets. Multidocument transactions help us to  achieve all-or-nothing execution to maintain data integrity.  The multidocument transactions are atomic.     When a transaction commits, all data changes made   in the transaction are saved and visible outside the  transaction. The data changes are not visible outside  the transaction until the transaction is committed.    Subhashini Chellappan and Dharanitharan Ganesan 2020  S. Chellappan and D. Ganesan, MongoDB Recipes,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4891-1_6  157   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons     When a transaction aborts, all data changes made in the  transaction are discarded without ever becoming visible.  Note  Multidocument transactions are available only for a replica  set. If we try to use multidocument transactions on a nonreplica set,  we would get the error “Transaction numbers are only allowed on a  replica set member or mongos,” as shown in Figure 6-1.   Figure 6-1.  Error on usage of multidocument transaction on a  nonreplica set   Limitations of Transactions Transactions do have some limitations, which are given here.     You can specify CRUD operations only on existing   collections. The collections can be in different  databases.     You cannot perform read write operations on config,   admin, and local databases.     You cannot write to system.* collections.     You cannot create or drop indexes inside a transaction.     You cannot perform non-CRUD operations inside a   transaction.     You cannot return an operation’s query plan  i.e., explain .  158   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons   Transactions and Sessions In MongoDB, transactions are associated with sessions. MongoDB’s  sessions provide a framework that supports consistency and writes that  can be retried. MongoDB’s sessions are available only for replica sets  and shared clusters. A session is required to start the transaction. You  cannot run a transaction outside a session, and a session can run only one  transaction at a time. A session is essentially a context.  There are three commands that important in working with   transactions.              session.startTransaction  : To start a new  transaction in the current session.  session.commitTransaction  : To save changes  made by the operations in the transaction.  session.abortTransaction  : To abort the  transaction without saving it.   Recipe 6-1. Working with Multidocument  Transactions In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to work with multidocument  transactions.   Problem You want to work with multidocument transactions.   Solution Use session.startTransaction  , session.commitTransaction  , and  session.abortTransaction  .  159    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons  ChapTer 6   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to work with multidocument transactions.   Step 1: Multidocument Transactions  To work with multidocument transactions, first we create an employee  collection under the employee database as shown here.  use employee  db.createCollection "employee"   Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> use employee switched to db employee myrs:PRIMARY> db.createCollection "employee"  {         "ok" : 1,         "operationTime" : Timestamp 1552385760, 1 ,         "$clusterTime" : {                 "clusterTime" : Timestamp 1552385760, 1 ,                 "signature" : {                         "hash" :  BinData 0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAA=" ,                          "keyId" : NumberLong 0                  }         } }  Next, insert a few documents as shown here.  db.employee.insert [{_id:1001, empName:"Subhashini"},{_id:1002,  empName:"Shobana"}]   160   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons  Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> db.employee.insert [{_id:1001,  empName:"Subhashini"},{_id:1002, empName:"Shobana"}]  BulkWriteResult {         "writeErrors" : [ ],         "writeConcernErrors" : [ ],         "nInserted" : 2,         "nUpserted" : 0,         "nMatched" : 0,         "nModified" : 0,         "nRemoved" : 0,         "upserted" : [ ] }   Now, create a session as shown here.  session = db.getMongo  .startSession    Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> session = db.getMongo  .startSession   session { "id" : UUID "55d56ef2-cab1-40c0-8d01-c2f75b5696b5"  }  Next, start the transaction and insert a few documents as shown here.  session.startTransaction   session.getDatabase "employee" .employee.insert [{_ id:1003,empName:"Taanushree"},{_id:1004, empName:"Aruna M S"}]   161   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons  Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> session.startTransaction   myrs:PRIMARY> session.getDatabase "employee" .employee. insert [{_id:1003,empName:"Taanushree"},{_id:1004,  empName:"Aruna M S"}]  BulkWriteResult {         "writeErrors" : [ ],         "writeConcernErrors" : [ ],         "nInserted" : 2,         "nUpserted" : 0,         "nMatched" : 0,         "nModified" : 0,         "nRemoved" : 0,         "upserted" : [ ] }   Now, we try to read the collection from inside and outside of the   transactions. First, we will read the collection from inside the transaction.  session.getDatabase "employee" .employee.find    Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> session.getDatabase "employee" .employee.find   { "_id" : 1001, "empName" : "Subhashini" } { "_id" : 1002, "empName" : "Shobana" } { "_id" : 1003, "empName" : "Taanushree" } { "_id" : 1004, "empName" : "Aruna M S" }  We can see the modifications from inside the transaction.  162   Second, we will try to read the collection from outside of the transaction.  ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons  db.employee.find    myrs:PRIMARY> db.employee.find   { "_id" : 1001, "empName" : "Subhashini" } { "_id" : 1002, "empName" : "Shobana" }  Because the transactions are not committed, we cannot see   modifications outside the transaction.  Issue the following command to commit the transaction.  session.commitTransaction    Here is the ouput:  myrs:PRIMARY> session.commitTransaction    Now, we can see the modifications outside of the transaction also.  myrs:PRIMARY> db.employee.find   { "_id" : 1001, "empName" : "Subhashini" } { "_id" : 1002, "empName" : "Shobana" } { "_id" : 1003, "empName" : "Taanushree" } { "_id" : 1004, "empName" : "Aruna M S" }   Recipe 6-2. Isolation Test Between Two  Concurrent Transactions In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to perform an isolation test  between two concurrent transactions.  163    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons  ChapTer 6   Problem You want to perform an isolation test between two concurrent  transactions.   Solution Use session.startTransaction  , session.commitTransaction   and  session.abortTransaction  .   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to perform an isolation test between  two concurrent transactions.   Step 1: Isolation Test Between Two Concurrent  Transactions  Create a first connection as shown here.  var session1 = db.getMongo  .startSession   session1.startTransaction   session1.getDatabase "employee" .employee.update {_id:1003},  {$set:{designation: "TL" }}   Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> var session1 = db.getMongo  .startSession   myrs:PRIMARY> session1.startTransaction   myrs:PRIMARY> session1.getDatabase "employee" .employee. update {_id:1003},{$set:{designation: "TL" }}  WriteResult { "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 }   164   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons  Next, read the collection as shown here.  session1.getDatabase "employee" .employee.find    Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> session1.getDatabase "employee" .employee.find   { "_id" : 1001, "empName" : "Subhashini" } { "_id" : 1002, "empName" : "Shobana" } { "_id" : 1003, "empName" : "Taanushree", "designation" : "TL" } { "_id" : 1004, "empName" : "Aruna M S" }  Now, create a second connection and update the documents as    shown here.  var session2 = db.getMongo  .startSession   session2.startTransaction   session2.getDatabase "employee" .employee.update {_id:{$in:  [1001,1004]}},{$set:{designation:"SE"}},{multi:"true"}   Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> var session2 = db.getMongo  .startSession   myrs:PRIMARY> session2.startTransaction   myrs:PRIMARY> session2.getDatabase "employee" .employee. update {_id:{$in:[1001,1004]}},{$set:{designation:"SE"}},{multi :"true"}  WriteResult { "nMatched" : 2, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 2 }   Next, read the collection as shown here.  session2.getDatabase "employee" .employee.find    165   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons  Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> session2.getDatabase "employee" .employee.find   { "_id" : 1001, "empName" : "Subhashini", "designation" : "SE" } { "_id" : 1002, "empName" : "Shobana" } { "_id" : 1003, "empName" : "Taanushree" } { "_id" : 1004, "empName" : "Aruna M S", "designation" : "SE" }  Here, the transactions are isolated, and each transaction shows the   modification that it has made itself.   Recipe 6-3. Transactions with Write  Conflicts In this recipe, we are going to discuss write conflicts with transactions.   Problem You want to see the error message for write conflicts that occurs when two  transactions try to modify the same document.   Solution Use session.startTransaction  , session.commitTransaction   and  session.abortTransaction  .   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to manage write conflicts between two  concurrent transactions.  166   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons   Step 1: Transactions with Write Conflicts  Create a first connection as shown here.  var session1 = db.getMongo  .startSession   session1.startTransaction   session1.getDatabase "employee" .employee.update {empName:  "Subhashini"},{$set:{empName: "Subha" }}   Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> var session1 = db.getMongo  .startSession   myrs:PRIMARY> session1.startTransaction   myrs:PRIMARY> session1.getDatabase "employee" .employee.update  {empName:"Subhashini"},{$set:{empName: "Subha" }}  WriteResult { "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 }  myrs:PRIMARY>  Now, create a second connection and try to update the same   document as shown here.  var session2 = db.getMongo  .startSession   session2.startTransaction   session2.getDatabase "employee" .employee.update {empName:  "Subhashini"},{$set:{empName: "Subha" }}   Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> var session2 = db.getMongo  .startSession   myrs:PRIMARY> session2.startTransaction   myrs:PRIMARY> session2.getDatabase "employee" .employee.update  {empName:"Subhashini"},{$set:{empName: "Subha" }}  WriteCommandError {         "errorLabels" : [                 "TransientTransactionError"  167   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons          ],         "operationTime" : Timestamp 1552405529, 1 ,         "ok" : 0,         "errmsg" : "WriteConflict",         "code" : 112,         "codeName" : "WriteConflict",         "$clusterTime" : {                 "clusterTime" : Timestamp 1552405529, 1 ,                 "signature" : {                         "hash" :  BinData 0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAA=" ,                          "keyId" : NumberLong 0                  }         } }   Here, MongoDB detects a write conflict immediately, even though the   transactions are not yet committed.   Recipe 6-4. Discarding Data Changes  with abortTransaction In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to discard data changes with  abortTransaction.   Problem You want to discard data changes with abortTransaction.  168   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons   Solution Use session.startTransaction  , session.commitTransaction  , and  session.abortTransaction  .   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to discard data changes using the  abortTransaction method.   Step 1: Discard Data Changes  Create a student collection under the student database as shown here.  use student; db.createCollection "student"   Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> use student; switched to db student myrs:PRIMARY> db.createCollection "student"  {         "ok" : 1,         "operationTime" : Timestamp 1552406937, 1 ,         "$clusterTime" : {                 "clusterTime" : Timestamp 1552406937, 1 ,                 "signature" : {                         "hash" :  BinData 0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAA=" ,                          "keyId" : NumberLong 0                  }         } } myrs:PRIMARY>  169   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons  Next, insert a few documents as shown here.  db.student.insert {_id:1001,name:"subhashini"}  db.student.insert {_id:1002,name:"shobana"}   Start a transaction and insert a document.  var session1 = db.getMongo  .startSession   session1.startTransaction   session1.getDatabase "student" .student.insert {_id:1003,  name:"Taanushree"}   Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> var session1 = db.getMongo  .startSession   myrs:PRIMARY> session1.startTransaction   myrs:PRIMARY> session1.getDatabase "student" .student.insert   {_id:1003,name:"Taanushree"}  WriteResult { "nInserted" : 1 }  myrs:PRIMARY>  Now, find the document from the collection and session.  db.student.find    Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> db.student.find   { "_id" : 1001, "name" : "subhashini" } { "_id" : 1002, "name" : "shobana" } myrs:PRIMARY>session1.getDatabase "student" .student.find   myrs:PRIMARY> session1.getDatabase "student" .student.find   { "_id" : 1001, "name" : "subhashini" } { "_id" : 1002, "name" : "shobana" } { "_id" : 1003, "name" : "Taanushree" } myrs:PRIMARY>  170   ChapTer 6    MulTIdoCuMenT TransaCTIons  Now, you can discard the data changes with abortTransaction as   shown here.  session1.abortTransaction    Here is the output,  myrs:PRIMARY> session1.abortTransaction    Now, you can find the collection as shown here.  db.student.find   myrs:PRIMARY> db.student.find   { "_id" : 1001, "name" : "subhashini" } { "_id" : 1002, "name" : "shobana" }  Here, the data changes are discarded.  Note  Multidocument transactions are only available for  deployments that use WiredTiger storage engine.  171   CHAPTER 7  MongoDB Monitoring  and Backup  In Chapter 6, we discussed transactions in MongoDB. In this chapter, we  are going to discuss the following topics:     MongoDB monitoring tools.     Backup and restore with MongoDB.   MongoDB Monitoring MongoDB provides various tools to monitor the database. These  MongoDB monitoring tools help us to understand what is happening with  a database at various levels.   Log File The first basic tool is the log file.   Recipe 7-1. Working with MongoDB Log Files In this recipe, we are going to discuss MongoDB log files.    Subhashini Chellappan and Dharanitharan Ganesan 2020  S. Chellappan and D. Ganesan, MongoDB Recipes,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4891-1_7  173    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  Chapter 7   Problem You want to see the MongoDB log file and set the log level.   Solution The MongoDB log file is present in the following installation path:  c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\log>  Use the db.setLogLevel function to set the log level.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to see the log file in mongo shell.   Step 1: To Display the Log File Content   and Set the Log Level  Type the following command in the mongo shell.  show logs  Here is the output,  > show logs global startupWarnings  show log global  174  You can see the log entries by typing the next command.  We cannot filter the log messages in the console.   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  MongoDB has several logging levels, which can be set using the db.  setLogLevel function.  The syntax for db.setLogLevel is  db.setLogLevel  ,     Here, level indicates the log verbosity level, which ranges from 0  to 5. The default log level is 0, which includes informational messages.  Levels 1 to 5 increase the verbosity level to include debug messages. The  second argument, component, is optional. This refers to the name of the  component for which you want to set the verbosity level. The component  name corresponds to the   from the corresponding systemLog. component. .verbosity setting:  accessControl command control ftdc geo index network query replication recovery sharding storage storage.journal transaction write  command.  To set the log level to 2 on the topic query, issue the following   db.setLogLevel 2,"query"   175   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  Here is the output,  > db.setLogLevel 2,"query"  {         "was" : {                 "verbosity" : 0,                 "accessControl" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "command" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "control" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "executor" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "geo" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "index" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "network" : {                         "verbosity" : -1,                         "asio" : {                                 "verbosity" : -1                         },                         "bridge" : {                                 "verbosity" : -1                         }                 },  176   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup                  "query" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "replication" : {                         "verbosity" : -1,                         "heartbeats" : {                                 "verbosity" : -1                         },                         "rollback" : {                                 "verbosity" : -1                         }                 },                 "sharding" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "storage" : {                         "verbosity" : -1,                         "recovery" : {                                 "verbosity" : -1                         },                         "journal" : {                                 "verbosity" : -1                         }                 },                 "write" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "ftdc" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },  177   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup                  "tracking" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "transaction" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 }         },         "ok" : 1 }  MongoDB echoes back the previous configuration before the new   setting was applied. At the top, you can see the default level, which  indicates that any components that are not set will log at this level. Here, it  will override only the query component. The -1 verbosity indicates that it  inherits the default level from its parent.  To see the current level, issue the following command.  db. getLogComponents  Here is the output,  > db.getLogComponents   {         "verbosity" : 0,         "accessControl" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         },         "command" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         },         "control" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         },  178   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup          "executor" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         },         "geo" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         },         "index" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         },         "network" : {                 "verbosity" : -1,                 "asio" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "bridge" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 }         },         "query" : {                 "verbosity" : 2         },         "replication" : {                 "verbosity" : -1,                 "heartbeats" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "rollback" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 }         },  179   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup          "sharding" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         },         "storage" : {                 "verbosity" : -1,                 "recovery" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 },                 "journal" : {                         "verbosity" : -1                 }         },         "write" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         },         "ftdc" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         },         "tracking" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         },         "transaction" : {                 "verbosity" : -1         } } >  log file:  > db.demos.find   >  180  Here, the query level is set to 2. Now, issue the following query, which we’ll use to add an entry to the    Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  This query will not return any results because there is no collection   named demos in the test database.  Now, issue this command to see the log file.  > show log global  Here are the last few lines of log file output,  2019-02-17T16:08:43.681+0530 D QUERY    [conn1]   Collection test.demos does not exist.

Now set the query log level as -1:  > db.setLogLevel -1,"query"   Then, issue the following query and observe the details in the log file as   explained further later.  > db.demos.find {y:1}   > show log global  Now check the log file by using the following command.  Now check the end of the log file: We cannot see the extra logging   information for this find query.  Use db.setLogLevel 0  to turn off the logging level.  181   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  If we do not specify the option as query or write or anything, it will be   applied for all options.  The log level 5 is very detailed; levels 1 to 3 are more useful options and   these are recommended unless you need all of the detailed information  provided by the highest log level of 5.  Also, setting the appropriate log level helps us to improve the   performance of queries by identifying the query plans logged in the log file  and also by identifying the slow operations by checking the time taken to  execute a query.  Note  refer to recipe 7-10 to learn more about MongoDB query plans.   MongoDB Performance It is mandatory to analyze the performance of the database when we  develop new applications with MongoDB. Performance degradation could  happen due to hardware availability issues, number of open database  connections, and database access strategies.  Performance issues indicate the database is operating at full capacity   and abnormal traffic load due to an increase in the number of connections. The database profiler can help us to understand the various operations   performed on the database that cause performance degradation.   Database Profiler  The database profiler is used to collect information about the commands  that are executed against a running mongod instance. The database profiler  writes all the collected data to the system.profile capped collection in  the admin database.  182   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  MongoDB also has a Performance Advisor tool that automatically   monitors slow queries and suggests new indexes to improve query  performance. A query is considered to be slow if it takes more than 100  milliseconds to execute.  Note  the performance advisor tool is available in the MongoDB  atlas cluster. MongoDB atlas is the global cloud database service for  modern applications.  The profiler is turned off by default. It can be enabled on a per- database   or per-instance basis at any one of the profiling levels mentioned in Table 7-1.  Table 7-1.  Profiling Levels  Level  Description  0  1  2  the profiler is off and does not collect any data. this is the default profiler  level.  the profiler collects data for operations that take longer than the value of  the slowms parameter.  the profiler collects data for all operations.   Recipe 7-2. Working with Database Profiler In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to enable database profiler and  how to set the profiling level.   Problem You want to enable database profiling with a profile level.  183    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  Chapter 7   Solution Use the db.setProfilingLevel   helper in the mongo shell.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to enable the database profiler.   Step 1: Enable and Configure Database Profiler  To enable the database profiler to collect all database information use the  following command.  db.setProfilingLevel 2   Here is the output,  > db.setProfilingLevel 2  { "was" : 0, "slowms" : 100, "sampleRate" : 1, "ok" : 1 }  was is the key value pair indicating the previous level of profiling. You can specify the threshold for slow operations using the next command.  db.setProfilingLevel 1, { slowms: 30 }   Here is the output,  > db.setProfilingLevel 1, { slowms: 30 }  { "was" : 2, "slowms" : 100, "sampleRate" : 1, "ok" : 1 }  Here, the slow operation threshold is 30 milliseconds. To profile a random sample of slow operations, use the following   db.setProfilingLevel 1, { sampleRate: 0.53 }   command.  184   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  That code sets the profiler to sample 53% of all slow operations.  Note  the default threshold value for the slow operation is 100  milliseconds.  You can get the profiling level by issuing the following command.  db.getProfilingStatus    Here is the output,  > db.getProfilingStatus   { "was" : 1, "slowms" : 30, "sampleRate" : 1 }  The was field indicates the current profiling level. To disable the database profiler, use this command.  db.setProfilingLevel 0   Here is the output,  > db.setProfilingLevel 0  { "was" : 1, "slowms" : 30, "sampleRate" : 1, "ok" : 1 }  To enable profiling for an entire mongod instance, pass the following   option to the mongod instance at the time of starting it.  mongod --profile 1 --slowms 20 --slowOpSampleRate 0.5  This command sets the profiling level to 1, the slow operation   threshold to 20 milliseconds, and it profiles only 50% of the slow  operations.  185   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup   Recipe 7-3. View Database Profiler In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to view database profiler.   Problem You want to view database profiler information.   Solution Use db.system.profile.find   in the mongo shell.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to view database profiler information.   Step 1: Enable and Configure Database Profiler  The database profiler logs information in the system.profile collection.  You need to query system.collection to view profiling information.

If you are working  on a shared cluster, it shows information about a mongos instance.  192   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup   Recipe 7-4. Working with mongostat In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to use mongostat to monitor the  MongoDB server.   Problem You want to see the details of a MongoDB server.   Solution Use the mongostat tool, which is available in the installation directory.  Usually the installation directory is C:\Program Files\MongoDB\ Server\4.0\bin or the custom path specified during your installation  process.  Avoid navigating to the directory each time to use the mongostat tool   and add the directory path to your PATH environment variable.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to view server information using  mongostat.   Step 1: mongostat Command  Issue the mongostat command by specifying the hostname and port of  MongoDB server.  193   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  Here is the output,  c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>mongostat --host  localhost:27017  insert query update delete getmore command dirty used flushes  vsize   res qrw arw net_in net_out conn                time     *0    *0     *0     *0       0   1460  0.0% 0.0%       0  4.97G 28.0M 00 10  11.6k   4.49m    2 Feb 17 16:59:19.131     *0    *0     *0     *0       0     20  0.0% 0.0%       0  4.97G 28.0M 00 10   163b   63.6k    2 Feb 17 16:59:20.095     *0    *0     *0     *0       0     20  0.0% 0.0%       0  4.97G 28.0M 00 10   158b   61.7k    2 Feb 17 16:59:21.090     *0    *0     *0     *0       0     10  0.0% 0.0%       0  4.97G 28.0M 00 10   157b   61.3k    2 Feb 17 16:59:22.090     *0    *0     *0     *0       0     10  0.0% 0.0%       0  4.97G 28.0M 00 10   157b   61.2k    2 Feb 17 16:59:23.093     *0    *0     *0     *0       0     20  0.0% 0.0%       0  4.97G 28.0M 00 10   158b   61.4k    2 Feb 17 16:59:24.092     *0    *0     *0     *0       0     20  0.0% 0.0%       0  4.97G 28.0M 00 10   159b   62.1k    2 Feb 17 16:59:25.080     *0    *0     *0     *0       0     10  0.0% 0.0%       0  4.97G 28.0M 00 10   157b   61.2k    2 Feb 17 16:59:26.082     *0    *0     *0     *0       0     10  0.0% 0.0%       0  4.97G 28.0M 00 10   157b   61.0k    2 Feb 17 16:59:27.088     *0    *0     *0     *0       0     20  0.0% 0.0%       0  4.97G 28.0M 00 10   158b   61.6k    2 Feb 17 16:59:28.083  Note  27017 is the default port. We can simply use mongostat  without any options if we want to connect and get statistics of  localhost and default port 27017. to connect a different or remote  instance, specify the option -host as shown.  194   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  You can see that there are multiple columns in the output.                                              insert query update delete: These columns show  the number of insert, query, update, and delete  operations per second.  getmore: This column shows the number of times the  getmore operation is executed in one second.  command: This column shows the number of commands  executed on the server in one second.  flushes: This column shows the number of times data  was flushed to disk in one second.  mapped: This column shows the amount of memory  used by the mongo process against a database. It is the  same as the size of the database.  vsize  virtual size : This column represents virtual  memory allocated to the entire mongod process.  res  resident memory : This column represents the  physical memory used by MongoDB.  faults: This column shows the number of Linux page  faults per second.  qrqw: This column shows queued-up reads and writes  that are waiting for the chance to be executed.  araw: This column shows number of active clients.  netIn and netOut: These columns show the network  traffic in and out of the MongoDB server within a given  time frame.  195   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup          conn: This column shows the number of open  connections.  time: This column shows the time frame in which  operations are performed.   mongotop  mongotop provides a method to track the amount of time spent by the  mongod process during reads and writes. mongotop provides statistics on a  per-collection level.   Recipe 7-5. Working with mongotop In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to use mongotop to track the  amount of time spent by the mongod process during reads and writes.   Problem You want to see the amount of time spent by the mongod process during  reads and writes.   Solution Issue the mongotop command in the installation path of MongoDB.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to view the amount of time spent  during reads and writes.  196   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup   Step 1: mongotop Command  Issue the following command.  c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>mongotop 2019-02-17T21:51:25.975+0530    connected to: 127.0.0.1                        ns    total    read    write     2019-02-   17T21:  51:26+  05:30        admin.system.roles      0ms     0ms      0ms     admin.system.version      0ms     0ms      0ms   config.system.sessions      0ms     0ms      0ms             emp.employee      0ms     0ms      0ms          employee.author      0ms     0ms      0ms         employee.authors      0ms     0ms      0ms      employee.categories      0ms     0ms      0ms        employee.employee      0ms     0ms      0ms employee.employeedetails      0ms     0ms      0ms           employee.names      0ms     0ms      0ms   db.stats    db.stats   provides the statistics of a single database.   Recipe 7-6. Working with db.stats   In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to get the statistics for a single  database.   Problem You want to see the disk and memory usage estimates for a database.  197    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  Chapter 7   Solution Use the db.stats command to display the statistics for a database.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to view the statistics for the database.   Step 1: db.stats   Command  Issue the following commands to display the statistics for a database  named employee.  > use employee switched to db employee > db.stats   {         "db" : "employee",         "collections" : 12,         "views" : 0,         "objects" : 40,         "avgObjSize" : 90.875,         "dataSize" : 3635,         "storageSize" : 401408,         "numExtents" : 0,         "indexes" : 12,         "indexSize" : 212992,         "fsUsedSize" : 208018800640,         "fsTotalSize" : 509929914368,         "ok" : 1 } >  198   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  The details such as data size and storage size are given in bytes. To see   the information in megabytes, issue the following command.  > db.stats 1000000  {         "db" : "employee",         "collections" : 12,         "views" : 0,         "objects" : 40,         "avgObjSize" : 90.875,         "dataSize" : 0.003635,         "storageSize" : 0.401408,         "numExtents" : 0,         "indexes" : 12,         "indexSize" : 0.212992,         "fsUsedSize" : 208020.402176,         "fsTotalSize" : 509929.914368,         "ok" : 1 } >   db.serverStatus    db.serverStatus   returns a document that provides statistics for the  state of a database process.   Recipe 7-7. Working with   db.serverStatus   In this recipe, we are going to discuss the db.serverStatus   command.  199    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  Chapter 7   Problem You want to see the memory status of a database.   Solution Use the db.serverStatus   command.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to view the statistics for the memory  status of a database.   Step 1: db.serverStatus   Command  Issue following command to view the memory statistics for a database.  > db.serverStatus  .mem {         "bits" : 64,         "resident" : 85,         "virtual" : 5089,         "supported" : true,         "mapped" : 0,         "mappedWithJournal" : 0 }   Backup and Restore with MongoDB Tools MongoDB provides mongodump and mongorestore utilities to work with  BSON data dumps. These utilities are useful for creating backups for small  deployments. To create resilient and nondisruptive backups for large  deployments, we can use file system or block-level disk snapshot methods.  200   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  We should use a system-level tool to create a copy of the device file  system that holds MongoDB files. The file system snaphots or the disk- level snapshot backup method require additional system configuration  outside of MongoDB, so we do not cover this in depth in this book.  When deploying MongoDB in production, we should have a backup   and failover strategy for capturing and restoring backups in the case of  data loss events.   Recipe 7-8. Working with mongodump In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to back up data using  mongodump.   Problem You want to back up data using mongodump.   Solution Use the mongodump command.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to back up data.  The mongodump utility makes a backup by connecting to a running   mongod or mongos instance.  When you run the mongodump command without specifying any   arguments, it connects to the mongodb running on localhost on port 27017  and creates a database backup named dump in the current directory.  201   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  Let us discuss how to issue the mongodump command to create a backup.    1.  Ensure mongod is running.    2.  Open a command prompt with administrator  privileges, navigate to the mongodb installation  folder, and type mongodump as shown here.  c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>mongodump    3.  You can see the dump folder in the current directory   as shown in Figure 7-1.  Figure 7-1.  MongoDB installation folder  You can specify the output directory by issuing the following command.  mkdir "c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\dump" mongodump --out "c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server"\4.0\dump  To create a backup of a collection, issue the following command.  mongodump --collection employee --db example --out "c:\Program  Files\MongoDB\Server"\4.0\backup  Here is the output,  c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>mongodump --collection  employee --db example --out "c:\Program Files\MongoDB\ Server"\4.0\backup  202   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  2019-01-14T18:36:28.460+0530    writing example.employee to 2019-01-14T18:36:28.465+0530    done dumping example.employee   1 document   You can make a backup from a remote host by specifying host and   port arguments as shown here.  mongodump --host sample.net --port 5017 --username user  --password "pass"   Automatic and Regular Backup Scheduling  Using mongodump It is good practice to perform a regular backup of all databases in case  of any hard failover. Follow these steps to perform a regular backup at a  specific interval.    1.  We can create scripts to create the backup directory   for the current date and time and export the  database to the same directory.  For Windows, create a bat  batch script  file with the  commands shown in Figure 7-2.  set DIRECTORY=backup_%date:~-4,4%%date:~-10,2%%date:~7,2%  mkdir %DIRECTORY%  mongodump -h   -d   -u   - p   -o %DIRECTORY%  Figure 7-2.  Creating a batch script file in Windows  203   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  For Unix Linux machines, create a shell script file  with the commands shown in Figure 7-3.

Schedule the script file to execute at a certain   interval. Use task scheduler or any other scheduler  for Windows, and use the CRON schedule for Unix  Linux.   Recipe 7-9. Working with mongorestore In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to restore data using  mongorestore.   Problem You want to restore data using mongorestore.   Solution Use the mongorestore command.  204   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to restore data.   Step 1: Restore Data Using mongorestore  To restore data, open a command prompt and navigate to the mongodb  installation folder, then issue the following command.  c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>mongorestore dump   Here, mongorestore imports the data present in the dump directory   to the running mongod instance. By default, mongorestore looks for a  database backup in the dump  directory. We can connect to a different port  of the active mongod instance and a different backup path by using this  command.  mongorestore --port       Step 2: Restore Data Using mongorestore to Remote  Instances  By default, mongorestore connects to running instance on localhost and  default port number 27017. To restore to a different host and different port,  we can specify the same using the --host and --port options as shown  here.  mongorestore --host   --port    --username myuser --password 'mypass'  backup mongodumpfile  Specify the username and password using options --user and   --password only if the remote mongod instance requires authentication.  205   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup   Recipe 7-10. Working with mongodb Query  Plans In this recipe, we are going to discuss query plans to understand the  MongoDB query execution details with query planner and query  optimizer.   Problem You want to understand the query execution plan.   Solution Use the cursor.explain   command.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to understand the query plan.   Step 1: Using explain   to Understand the Query Plan  To see the query plan during the MongoDB command execution, use  cursor.explain  . Let’s assume the employee collection is available in the  authors database with the data shown here.  MongoDB Enterprise > use authors switched to db authors MongoDB Enterprise > db.employee.find   { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde439" , "empId" : 1,  "empName" : "John", "state" : "KA", "country" : "India" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43a" , "empId" : 2,  "empName" : "Smith", "state" : "CA", "country" : "US" }  206   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup  { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43b" , "empId" : 3,  "empName" : "James", "state" : "FL", "country" : "US" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43c" , "empId" : 4,  "empName" : "Josh", "state" : "TN", "country" : "India" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43d" , "empId" : 5,  "empName" : "Joshi", "state" : "HYD", "country" : "India" }  To get the query plan while executing the command db.employee.  find  , use .explain   as shown here.  MongoDB Enterprise > db.employee.find  .explain    Here is the output,  MongoDB Enterprise > db.employee.find  .explain   {         "queryPlanner" : {                 "plannerVersion" : 1,                 "namespace" : "authors.employee",                 "indexFilterSet" : false,                 "parsedQuery" : {                  },                 "winningPlan" : {                         "stage" : "COLLSCAN",                         "direction" : "forward"                 },                 "rejectedPlans" : [ ]         },         "serverInfo" : {                 "host" : "DESKTOP-MEISTBV",                 "port" : 27017,                 "version" : "4.0.11",  207   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup                  "gitVersion" :  "417d1a712e9f040d54beca8e4943edc   e218e9a8c"          },         "ok" : 1 }  Observe in this output that there is no parsedQuery in the query   planner, and the winning plan says that it involves the complete collection  scan.  Now, let’s try to add a filter to the same query and observe the query plan.  MongoDB Enterprise > db.employee.find {country:"India"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde439" , "empId" : 1,  "empName" : "John", "state" : "KA", "country" : "India" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43c" , "empId" : 4,  "empName" : "Josh", "state" : "TN", "country" : "India" } { "_id" : ObjectId "5d50ed688dcf280c50fde43d" , "empId" : 5,  "empName" : "Joshi", "state" : "HYD", "country" : "India" }  We have added the filter condition to retrieve only country:India.  Now check the query plan for the same query with the filter condition.  MongoDB Enterprise> db.employee.find {country:"India"} .explain    Here is the output,  MongoDB Enterprise > db.employee.find {country:"India"} . explain   {         "queryPlanner" : {                 "plannerVersion" : 1,                 "namespace" : "authors.employee",                 "indexFilterSet" : false,                 "parsedQuery" : {  208   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup                          "country" : {                                 "$eq" : "India"                         }                 },                 "winningPlan" : {                         "stage" : "COLLSCAN",                         "filter" : {                                 "country" : {                                         "$eq" : "India"                                 }                         },                         "direction" : "forward"                 },                 "rejectedPlans" : [ ]         },         "serverInfo" : {                 "host" : "DESKTOP-MEISTBV",                 "port" : 27017,                 "version" : "4.0.11",                 "gitVersion" :  "417d1a712e9f040d54beca8e4943e   dce218e9a8c"          },         "ok" : 1 }  the query planner as  Observe in the preceding output that there is a parsed query added by   "parsedQuery" : { "country" : {"$eq" : "India" } }  209   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup   Step 2: Understanding Different Modes in explain    The explain   method accepts queryPlanner, executionStats,  or allPlansExecution as the operating mode. The default mode is  queryPlanner if we don’t specify otherwise.  Use the following command to use explain   with any of these   parameters as a mode.  db.employee.find  .explain "queryPlanner"   Here is the output,  MongoDB Enterprise > db.employee.find  .explain "queryPlanner"  {         "queryPlanner" : {                 "plannerVersion" : 1,                 "namespace" : "authors.employee",                 "indexFilterSet" : false,                 "parsedQuery" : {                  },                 "winningPlan" : {                         "stage" : "COLLSCAN",                         "direction" : "forward"                 },                 "rejectedPlans" : [ ]         },         "serverInfo" : {                 "host" : "DESKTOP-MEISTBV",                 "port" : 27017,                 "version" : "4.0.11",  210   Chapter 7    MongoDB Monitoring anD BaCkup                  "gitVersion" :  "417d1a712e9f040d54beca8e4943ed   ce218e9a8c"  Now use executionStats as a operation mode to the explain             },         "ok" : 1 }  method as shown here.

"nReturned" : 5: This is the number of rows returned.  "executionTimeMillis" : 0: This is the execution  time in milliseconds.  If the executionTimeMillis value is more, then it could be considered   a slow query and we must rewrite the query to optimize the executiuon  time by adding the required filters to retrieve only the required data. We  could also consider using an index on keys for better performance.  213   CHAPTER 8  MongoDB Security  In Chapter 7, we discussed monitoring and backup methods in  MongoDB. In this chapter, we are going to discuss the security features of  MongoDB.   Authentication and Authorization Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of the user, whereas  authorization or access control determines the verified user’s access to  resources and operations.  MongoDB supports the following various authentication mechanisms   for verifying the identity of the user.     SCRAM: This is the default authentication mechanism   for MongoDB. It verifies the user against their  username, password, and authentication database.      x.509 certificates: This mechanism uses x.509 certificates  for authentication. MongoDB supports a number of  authentication mechanisms that clients can use to verify  their identity. These mechanisms allow MongoDB to  integrate into an existing authentication system.  In addition to this, MongoDB Enterprise Edition also supports   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  LDAP  proxy authentication and  Kerberos authentication.    Subhashini Chellappan and Dharanitharan Ganesan 2020  S. Chellappan and D. Ganesan, MongoDB Recipes,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4891-1_8  215   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity  Note  Replica sets and shared clusters require internal  authentication between members when access control is enabled.  Refer to Recipe 8-2 to understand the authentication process for  replica sets.   Access Control MongoDB enforces authentication to identify users and their permissions  to access resources only if access control is enabled. The upcoming recipes  explain the procedure to create various roles and the mechanisms to  enable access control.  When you install MongoDB, it has no users. First, therefore, we need to   create the admin user, which can be used to create other users.   Roles In MongoDB, roles grant users access to MongoDB resources. MongoDB  has certain built-in roles, listed in Figure 8-1, which can be assigned to any  user to access resources. We can also create user-defined roles.  MongoDB  Built In  Roles  DB User Roles Cluster Admin Roles DB Admin Roles Super User Roles All Databases Roles  Figure 8-1.  MongoDB built-in roles  First, let’s look at the commonly used built-in roles.  216   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity   MongoDB User Roles read  The read role gives the holder access to read all of the user-created  collections.  readwrite  The readwrite role gives access to read all of the user-created collections  and also the ability to modify the nonsystem  i.e., user-created  collections.   MongoDB Admin Roles  dbAdmin  The dbAdmin role could help us to perform administrative tasks such as  schema-related tasks, indexing, and collecting statistics. We cannot use  this role to grant privileges for users and others’ role management.  We can perform any administrative tasks on a database using the dbOwner  role. This role also includes the other role previliges such as the readWrite,  dbAdmin, and userAdmin roles.  dbOwner  userAdmin  We can create and modify roles and users on the current active database.  217   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity   Cluster Admin Roles  clusterAdmin  The clusterAdmin role provides cluster management access. This role also  includes other role privileges, such as clusterManager, clusterMonitor,  and hostManager roles.  clusterManager  This role helps us to manage and monitor user actions on the mongodb cluster.   Recipe 8-1. Creating a Superuser  and Authenticating a User In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to create a superuser and  authenticate a user.   Problem You want to create a superuser and authenticate a user.   Solution Here are the commands:  db.createUser   mongo --username username --password password  --authenticationDatabase databasename db.auth     How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to create a superuser.  218   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity   Step 1: Create a Superuser  Connect to a mongod instance and type the following command.  > use admin > db.createUser {user:"superUserAdmin",pwd:"1234",roles:  [{role:    "userAdminAnyDatabase",db:"admin"}]}   Here is the output,  > use admin switched to db admin > db.createUser {user:"superUserAdmin",pwd:"1234",roles:[{role:  "userAdminAnyDatabase",db:"admin"}]}  Successfully added user: {         "user" : "superUserAdmin",         "roles" : [                 {                         "role" : "userAdminAnyDatabase",                         "db" : "admin"                 }         ] } >  To authenticate using the mongo shell, do with either of the following.     Use MongoDB command-line authentication   options  i.e., --username, --password, and – authenticationDatabase  when connecting to a  mongod or mongos instance.     Connect to a mongod or mongos instance, then run the  db.auth method against the authentication database.  219   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity   Step 2: Authenticate a User  Type the following command in the terminal  command prompt  while  connecting to a mongo shell.  > mongo --username superUserAdmin --password 1234  --authenticationDatabase admin  You will be connected to mongoshell. You can also use db.auth   to   authenticate a user.  Connect to a mongod instance by issuing the following command.  > use admin > db.auth "superUserAdmin","1234"   Here is the output,  > use admin switched to db admin > db.auth "superUserAdmin","1234"  1 >   Step 3: Create a New User with Read and Write Access  Control  Type the following command to create a new user with read and write  access control for the admin database.  > db.createUser    {     user: "user1000",pwd: "abc123",     roles: [ { role: "readWriteAnyDatabase", db:"admin" } ]   }      220   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity  Here is the output,  > db.createUser  ...   { ...     user: "user1000", ...     pwd: "abc123", ...     roles: [ { role: "readWriteAnyDatabase", db:"admin" } ] ...   } ...   Successfully added user: {         "user" : "user1000",         "roles" : [                 {                         "role" : "readWriteAnyDatabase",                         "db" : "admin"                 }         ] } >  Now, you can restart your MongoDB with access control enabled as   shown here.  mongod.exe --auth   Recipe 8-2. Authenticating a Server  in a Replica Set Using a Key File In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to authenticate a server in a  replica set using a key file.  221    MongoDB SeCuRity  ChapteR 8   Problem You want to authenticate a server in a replica set using a key file.   Solution Use a replica set and a key file.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to authenticate a server in a replica set  using a key file.   Step 1: Authenticate a Server in a Replica Set Using  a Key File  First, we will create a three-member replica set by following the procedure  given here.  Create three data directories as shown here.  md c:\mongodb\repset\rs1 md c:\mongodb\repset\rs2 md c:\mongodb\repset\rs3  Here is the output,  c:\>md c:\mongodb\repset\rs1 c:\>md c:\mongodb\repset\rs2 c:\>md c:\mongodb\repset\rs3  Next, start three mongod instances as shown here.  start mongod --bind_ip hostname --dbpath c:\mongodb\repset\rs1  --port 20001 --replSet myrs  222   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity  Figure 8-2 shows a mongod instance that is waiting for a connection on   port 20001.  start mongod --bind_ip hostname --dbpath c:\mongodb\repset\rs2  --port 20002 --replSet myrs  Figure 8-2.

Modifying Access  for the Existing User In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to modify access for the   existing user.  Let us use the superUserAdmin user, which we created in Recipe 8-1.   Problem We want to modify the access for superUserAdmin  created earlier .   Solution Check the granted access  i.e., assigned roles and privileges  of the user,  then revoke the permissions that are not needed or grant the new roles and  privileges.  229    MongoDB SeCuRity  ChapteR 8   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to modify the access of  superUserAdmin.   Step 1: Connect to the Instance with User  superUserAdmin and to admin Database  Use the following syntax.  mongo --username superUserAdmin --password 1234  --authenticationDatabase admin  Here is the output,  > mongo --username superUserAdmin --password 1234  --authenticationDatabase admin MongoDB shell version v4.0.11 connecting to: mongodb:  127.0.0.1:27017 ?authSource=admin&gssa piServiceName=mongodb Implicit session: session { "id" : UUID "9f31da4d-ac50-438a-  8dd5-2ebd4fefadbb"  } MongoDB server version: 4.0.11 >   Step 2: Identify the User’s Existing Roles  Use the following commands to get the roles of superUserAdmin in the   use   db.getUser "    admin database.  > use admin  230  > db.getUser "superUserAdmin"    ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity  Here is the output,  > show dbs; admin   0.000GB config  0.000GB local   0.000GB > use admin switched to db admin > db.getUser "superUserAdmin"  {         "_id" : "admin.superUserAdmin",         "userId" :  UUID "f109b62e-5138-487b-aa13-f183f977398c" ,         "user" : "superUserAdmin",         "db" : "admin",         "roles" : [                 {                         "role" : "userAdminAnyDatabase",                         "db" : "admin"                 }         ],         "mechanisms" : [                 "SCRAM-SHA-1",                 "SCRAM-SHA-256"         ] }  This output clearly shows the user superUserAdmin has "role" :   "userAdminAnyDatabase".  231   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity  Note  userAdminAnyDatabase is a built-in role that provides the  ability to perform administration operations as userAdmin on all  databases except local and config.   Step 3: Grant an Additional Role to the User  Use the following commands to assign the read role for the local database  for superUserAdmin.  Repeat the preceding step to identify the roles and to verify the newly   > use admin  > db.grantRolesToUser      "superUserAdmin",     [       { role: "read", db: "local" }     ]    added role to the user superUserAdmin. Here is the output,  > use admin switched to db admin > db.grantRolesToUser  ...     "superUserAdmin", ...     [ ...       { role: "read", db: "local" } ...     ] ...   > db.getUser "superUserAdmin"   232   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity  {         "_id" : "admin.superUserAdmin",         "userId" : UUID "f109b62e-5138-487b-aa13-f183f977398c" ,         "user" : "superUserAdmin",         "db" : "admin",         "roles" : [                 {                     "role" : "read", "db" : "local"                 },                 {                    "role" : "userAdminAnyDatabase","db" : "admin"                 }         ],         "mechanisms" : [                 "SCRAM-SHA-1","SCRAM-SHA-256"         ] }  As you can observe, "role" : "read" is added to the "db" : "local" for   the superUserAdmin user.   Step 4: Revoke an Existing Role from the User  Use this step to revoke the "role":"userAdminAnyDatabase" from the  superUserAdmin user.  > use admin > db.revokeRolesFromUser      "superUserAdmin",     [       { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }     ]    233   Now check the existing roles by repeating the earlier step and verify   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity  that the role is removed.  > db.getUser "superUserAdmin"   Here is the output,  > db.getUser "superUserAdmin"  {         "_id" : "admin.superUserAdmin",         "userId" : UUID "f109b62e-5138-487b-aa13-f183f977398c" ,         "user" : "superUserAdmin",         "db" : "admin",         "roles" : [                 {                         "role" : "read","db" : "local"                 }         ],         "mechanisms" : [                 "SCRAM-SHA-1",                 "SCRAM-SHA-256"         ] }  You can see that "role" : "userAdminAnyDatabase" is removed to the   "db" : "admin" for the superUserAdmin user.   Recipe 8-4. Change the Password  for the Existing User In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to change the password for the  superUserAdmin user.  234   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity   Problem You want to change the password for a specific user.   Solution Use changeUserPassword   with the new password.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to change the password of a user.   Step 1: Connect to the Instance with User  superUserAdmin and to the admin Database  mongo --username superUserAdmin --password 1234  --authenticationDatabase admin  Here is the output,  > mongo --username superUserAdmin --password 1234  --authenticationDatabase admin MongoDB shell version v4.0.11 connecting to: mongodb:  127.0.0.1:27017 ?authSource=admin&  gssapiServiceName=mongodb Implicit session: session { "id" : UUID "9f31da4d-ac50-438a-  8dd5-2ebd4fefadbb"  } MongoDB server version: 4.0.11 >  235   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity   Step 2: Change the Password  > db.changeUserPassword "superUserAdmin", "newpwd@123"   Now disconnect the instance and connect with the new password to  ensure that the password has been changed. Here is the output,  > exit bye C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin> mongo --username super  UserAdmin --password newpwd@123 --authenticationDatabase admin MongoDB shell version v4.0.11 connecting to: mongodb:  127.0.0.1:27017 ?authSource=admin&  gssapiServiceName=mongodb Implicit session: session { "id" : UUID "9676d897-719d-4857-  9570-af7e982e10fe"  } MongoDB server version: 4.0.11 >   Recipe 8-5. Track the Activity of Users  in a Cluster In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to track the various activities of  different users.   Problem You want to track user activity.   Solution Use the auditing feature.  236   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity  Note  the auditing feature is available in MongoDB enterprise  edition only.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to enable the auditing feature and store  the audit information in different output formats like writing audit events  to the console, a JSON file, or a BSON file.  We can record the operations shown in Figure 8-6 using the auditing   feature  Audit  Events  Schema  DDL  operations  Replica set and shared cluster activities  User authentication information  User authorization information to various mongo resources  Various CRUD operations  Figure 8-6.  Audit events   Step 1: Enable and Configure Audit Events  We can use auditDestination to enable the auditing feature and specify  the output location of audit information.  Use the syslog output to print the audit events to syslog.  > mongod --dbpath data testDB --auditDestination syslog  Note  this syslog option is not available for Windows.  237   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity  Use the console output to print the audit events to the console.  > mongod --dbpath data testDB --auditDestination console  Use the auditFormat JSON output to print the audit events to a   separate JSON file in any path.  > mongod --dbpath data testDB --auditDestination file  --auditFormat JSON --auditPath data testDB auditLog.json   Step 2: Create an Audit Filter  Audit filters help us to enable audit features for only certain operations.  Let us say, for example, that we want to create an audit filter to log only the  audit events related to authenticatation operations that are performed on  the local database. Use the following filter.  { atype: "authenticate", "param.db": "test" }  Here, atype refers to the action type and param.db refers to the   monitoring database.  feature.  Use the following command to set the filter while enabling the audit   > mongod --dbpath data testDB --auth --auditDestination file  --auditFilter '{atype: "authenticate", "param.db": "local"}'  --auditFormat JSON --auditPath data testDB auditLog.json   Recipe 8-6. Encryption In this recipe, we are going to discuss how to encrypt the data in MongoDB.   Problem You want to encrypt the data stored or moved into MongoDB.  238   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity   Solution Use encryption at the file level and the whole database level.  Note  the auditing feature is available in MongoDB enterprise  edition only.   How It Works Let’s follow the steps in this section to encrypt the data stored and decrypt  while reading.   Step 1: Understanding Different Encryption Options  MongoDB offers encryption at two levels:     Encrypting data in motion.     Encrypting data in rest.  Encrypting Data in Motion  MongoDB Enterprise Edition supports Transport Layer Security  TLS  and  Secure Sockets Layer  SSL  encryption techniques to secure the data being  sent or received over the networks.  Encrypting Data in Rest  MongoDB Enterprise Edition supports a native storage-based symmetric  key encryption technique to secure the data available on the storage  system. It also provides Transparent Data Encryption  TDE , which is used  to encrypt the whole database.  239   ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity   Step 2: Encrypting the Data at Rest Using Local Key  Management  Create a 16- or 32-character string base64-encoded key file using any  appropriate method. We use the openssl method as shown here.  > openssl rand -base64 32 > mongo-encryption-file  Here is the output,  C:\Users\DHARANI\Downloads\openssl-win>  openssl rand -base64 32 > mongo-encryption-file  Now we can see in Figure 8-7 the encryption file created in the same   directory.  Figure 8-7.  The new encryption file  Now to use the encryption file to encrypt the data in the storage   engine, start MongoDB with the following options.  --enableEncryption --encryptionKeyFile    > mongod --enableEncryption --encryptionKeyFile  " C:\Program  Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\mongo-encryption-file"  240   The output is shown in Figure 8-8.  ChapteR 8    MongoDB SeCuRity  Figure 8-8.
