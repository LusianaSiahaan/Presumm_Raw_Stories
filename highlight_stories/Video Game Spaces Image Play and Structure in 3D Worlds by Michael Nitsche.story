Help  surely was needed as the interdisciplinary approach of this book depended on  a lot of inspiration, guidance, and patience.  First, thanks go to Maureen Thomas, who oversaw my initial approach to  virtual spaces at the University of Cambridge. During my time in Cambridge,  Francois Penz directed the program that put me on the path to game spaces  as  expressive  forms  and  Stanislav  Roudavski  was  not  only  an  inspiring  col- laborator but also a bright critic. Both helped me in the early stages of the  project. More recently, I have to thank my colleagues at the Georgia Institute  of Technology: Ian Bogost for his insightful commentaries, Janet Murray for  her responses to my drafts, and Jay Bolter for the many hours spent on discus- sions and reviews of this book. They provided not only encouragement but  also practical help to get the book done. Another warm thank you to the fan- tastic  students  at  Tech,  including  Calvin  Ashmore,  Clara  Fernandez,  Jose  Zagal, and the many other bright minds I met in the courses and in the Digital  World and Image Group. I am also very grateful to Allison Whitney, Andrea  Wood, Daryl Farmer, Ruben Ramirez-Sanchez, and Shannon Dobranski for  their help in proofreading the manuscript and to Hee Rin Lee who provided  the illustrations.  Portions  of  the  work  presented  here  are  based  on  published  material:  section 5.5  The Concept of the Monomyth  and section 11.2  Labyrinths and  Mazes  draw from a chapter in Playing the Universe, Games and Gaming in Science  Fiction  Nitsche 2007b , section 9.1  Focalization in Games  is based on my  paper for Future Play 2005  Nitsche 2005b , section 7.6  Performing Cameras     is informed by a chapter in New Visions in Performance: The Impact of Digital  Technologies  Nitsche and Thomas 2004 , and the idea of story maps in section  13.3  was  already  introduced  in  a  paper  for  the  International  Conference  on  Virtual Storytelling  Nitsche and Thomas 2003 . These last two publications  were coauthored by Maureen Thomas.  Above all, I am grateful to my whole family—especially my wife Karolina,  our daughter Klara, and our son Nicholas. Their love, patience, and never- ending  support  shine  brightly  over  any  digital  sensation  to  guide  and  carry me.  Acknowledgments  viii   1  Introduction  Interactive media and their most prominent and most diverse representatives,  video  games,  have  unsettled  traditional  media  theory.  They  introduced  the  meta-medium computer into our living rooms, opening up a range of oppor- tunities  so  unfamiliar  and  so  diverse  that  we  are  still  struggling  with  clear  deﬁ nitions. They changed the face of established media and media production  and became a billion-dollar industry along the way. This industry, its fan base,  and  a  range  of  noncommercial  outlets  constantly  generate  new  artifacts  to  analyze  and  learn  from.  Games  have  developed  from  a  niche  market  into  a  culturally  and  commercially  signiﬁ cant  media  form.  They  may  still  be  the  new kid on the block, but they are rapidly growing up.  Games  also  have  entered  academia,  where  they  have  been  investigated  from a variety of perspectives. Occasionally, proponents of different approaches  have engaged in a very lively debate. But we still have to explore much of  the ever-expanding ground covered by the developing media. One challenge  is the disproportion of a still-expanding media form and the often necessarily  slower speed of generating the critical literature about it. Whereas the proph- ets  of  cyberspace  were  restricted  to  relatively  few  digital  artifacts,  often  available to the selected few with access to high-tech research labs, the ﬁ eld  of game studies today faces an overabundance of games to analyze. This body  of  work,  in  many  regards,  was  necessary  to  support  a  wider  analysis  of  new media.  It is incomprehensible that any single theory could do justice to a form as  rich and vivid as the video game. The variety of these games calls for a diver- sity  of  analytical  approaches:  no  one  approach  is  sufﬁ cient,  but  many  offer  different yet interconnected perspectives. The more this analytical spectrum    grows in width and depth, the richer our picture of the video game becomes.  This book tries to add its share to the spectrum. It will refer to the debates  and key issues in games research but will shine a different light on them from  a very speciﬁ c angle—that of navigable three-dimensional virtual spaces. From  this perspective, the book will revisit some models that have been examined  before and suggest new ones that have yet to be debated.  3D game spaces allow players to crawl, jump, run, ﬂ y, and teleport into  new worlds of unheard-of form and function. The game space we can experi- ence,  discover,  and  manipulate  has  become  endless  and  at  the  same  time  more accessible than ever. Video game spaces stage our dreams and nightmares  and  they  seem  to  get  better  at  it  every  year.  We  will  tour  the  landscape  of  video  games  in  an  effort  to  discover  how  the  games  work,  how  they  are  presented, how they can be read, why they are important, and how they can  be improved.  Following this book’s call for an interdisciplinary approach, its argument  draws  on  many  other  disciplines  such  as  literary  studies,  architecture,  and  cinema. Though comparative and interdisciplinary, it does not focus on the  comparison  of  media  as  its  main  goal.  Instead,  the  cross-referencing  is  the  result of the topic. Spaces in video games can only be discussed through these  references.  Like the 2D desktop metaphors that came before, the growing use of 3D  graphics in video games shows signs of an evolutionary process. New and old  game  franchises  adapt  to  the  new  “standard”  or  they  struggle  to  survive.  Whether it is Mario’s step into 3D in Super Mario 64  Miyamoto 1996 , the  polygon worlds of the massively multiplayer online title Meridian 59  Sellers  1996 ,  the  3D  spaces  in  real-time  strategy  games  such  as  Ground  Control  Walﬁ sz and Andersson 2000 , or the jump from a top-down view in Grand Theft Auto II  Akiah, Conroy, and Hirst 1999  to the navigable 3D world of  Liberty City in Grand Theft Auto III  Filshie et al. 2001 , navigable 3D worlds  have become a critical factor of game development. The market is dominated  by  3D  graphics  in  a  way  that  suggests  an  overall  transformation.  This  also  affects the hardware of game systems. 3D graphics have shaped the hardware  development of personal computers in the form of specialized graphic cards  at  least  since  the  mid-1990s  with  the  release  of  the  NV1  and  Voodoo  1 cards.  Often, 3D graphics have become a sine qua non in the modern commercial  video game world—for better or worse. Yet the use of 3D graphics for its own  sake cannot be the goal but rather a means to achieve a more complex task:  the generation of ﬁ ctional worlds in the player’s imagination that grow from  a comprehension of the 3D representations. Like written text or 2D graphics,   Chapter 1  2   3D  worlds  have  unique  ways  to  support  this  imaginary  work.  This  raises  questions: How do game spaces achieve this effect? What are their key quali- ties? How can we improve their impact?  To  answer,  we  have  to  turn  to  the  player  and  the  player’s  experience.  Although  this  book  will  look  at  a  variety  of  design  issues  and  structures,  its fundamental principle is to examine games in terms of the player experi- ence. Space is an important element of this experience—and a very challeng- ing one. The argument here is that game spaces evoke narratives because the  player  is  making  sense  of  them  in  order  to  engage  with  them.  Through  a  comprehension of signs and interaction with them, the player generates new  meaning. The elements that are implemented in the game world to assist in  the comprehension will be called “evocative narrative elements,” because they  do not contain a story themselves but trigger important parts of the narrative  process  in  the  player.  These  processes  can  lead  to  the  generation  of  a  form  of narrative.  Such  an  approach  has  obvious  parallels  to  semiotics.  Video  game  worlds  depend on representation and sign systems and the audiovisual presentation  is  an  important  section  in  this  book.  But  the  main  argument  will  always  return  to  the  concept  of  space  and  spatial  experience.  Game  spaces  are  approached not as foregrounded spectacles based on visual cues such as per- spective and parallax but as presented spaces that are assigned an architectural  quality. The discussion will concentrate on their spatial structures and how  players can interact with them. In the games discussed, players want to engage  not with the screen but with a ﬁ ctional world these images bring to mind.  This indicates the references to phenomenology that guide this investigation.  Experience,  comprehension,  and  spatial  practice  are  phenomenological  key  elements that reappear throughout this discussion of virtual space. But how  this experience is generated in game worlds is new. As much as we can learn  from these approaches, there are fundamental differences in the way experience  of space happens in nondigital settings and the necessarily mediated way we  encounter game worlds.  The screen remains an important layer as it is mainly through the screen  that the game worlds can unfold and become accessible to today’s player. Video  game worlds are navigable spaces that offer a wide range of interactions, but  they are also spaces told to us using certain forms of presentation. This media- tion is an important factor in the narrative processes connected to game worlds.  It is in these presentations that we can ﬁ nd ﬁ lters, which are constantly at work  in 3D video games. Consequently, this book is structured in three main sec- tions:  one  on  the  reappearing  question  of  narrative  and  structure  in  game  worlds, one on presentation, and one on the functionality of game spaces.  Introduction  3   If this book has to be associated with a speciﬁ c school or set of approaches  to  game  research,  it  would  be  with  a  player-focused  and  experience-driven  tier.  This  is  a  result  of  the  topic  at  hand:  the  question  of  space.  It  is  only  logical that the reader will ﬁ nd chapters on identity and player positioning  as well as on camera work and architectural theory. At the same time, this is  a  comparative  survey  driven  by  practical  analyses  of  existent  video  games.  Therefore,  the  reader  will  ﬁ nd  references  to  numerous  games  and  game  worlds.  Ultimately, this book is an exploration of the new universe that opened up  with the introduction of 3D graphics to games. This change has literally added  a new dimension to video games that calls for a reorientation of games research  and design and asks us to adjust our thinking about video games. Due to the  interdisciplinary nature of this undertaking, the book most certainly has to  miss  a  number  of  relevant  sources  and  concepts  but  is  intended  to  provide  balanced arguments and detailed discussion.  1.1  Video, Game, and Space  Space has been a central issue for the study of digital media since the intro- duction of cyberspace  e.g., Benedikt 1991  and Multi-User Dungeons  MUDs    e.g., Anders 1998 . It has been a deﬁ ning element of—at times opposing— studies  in  games  research.  Murray  argues  that  spatiality  is  one  of  the  core  features of digital media  1997 , Aarseth starts his discussion of Cybertexts  with a look at labyrinths  1997 , Ryan writes about narrative aspects of virtual  spaces   2001b ,  and  other  studies  of  video  games  include  often  substantial  chapters on space  e.g., Wolf 2002 . Qvortrup edited a trilogy of books on  different aspects of virtual spaces  2000, 2002; Madsen and Qvortrup 2002 ,  and more recently von Borries, Walz, and Böttger published a large collection  of short essays about spatiality in games and related issues  2007 . Most of  the  work  in  this  area  has  been  discussed  in  numerous  articles,  theses,  and  conference papers. Jenkins’s inﬂ uential essays on game spaces build up from  the mid-1990s  Fuller and Jenkins 1995  to a more rounded view almost a  decade later     Jenkins 2005  and are only one example. This short list is by  no means a full overview of the existing literature, but it shows that a study  as presented in this book has to be clearly positioned to operate in relation to  the other published works. This book touches on a range of established topics,  introduces  new  interpretations  of  them,  and  suggests  some  new  principles  based on the element of game spaces. It connects various approaches to digital  environments and, thus, has to clarify the ﬁ eld covered.  Chapter 1  4   To  avoid  generalizations  two  premises  will  be  applied.  The  games   discussed   cid:2   have to be available on consumer hardware;  cid:2   and have to offer navigable 3D environments.  The  restriction  to  available  consumer  products  ties  the  study  to  a  de  facto  analysis  of  existing  worlds  and  serves  as  a  reality  check  that  prohibits  any  overly enthusiastic prophecies. It avoids the danger of promising unrealistic  future wonders. Yet, where necessary, the argument in this book will refer to  additional examples that are not commonly available. Video game spaces are,  by and large, commercial products and thus limited by production costs and  market considerations. In order to avoid a purely commercial perspective, this  study also points to numerous research projects and art pieces. Notably, most  of these projects do not depend on additional hardware or expensive systems,  but are realized with the same technology that drives commercial video games.  The  author  realized  some  of  these  projects  himself  during  his  work  at  the  University  of  Cambridge  and  at  the  Georgia  Institute  of  Technology.  It  is  the  philosophy  of  the  Digital  Media  program  at  the  School  of  Literature,  Communication, and Culture at Georgia Tech to combine theory and analysis  of digital media with practical experimentation. In this spirit, the book points  to  those  kinds  of  experiments  and  combines  them  with  discussions  of  commercial games.  The second restriction is that each game discussed has to feature an interac- tive and navigable 3D virtual world. In practice, this means that players can  navigate through the world and interact with elements that are staged in it.  One consequence of this deﬁ nition is that these kind of worlds can offer dif- ferent viewing angles to whatever events are realized in them. Clearly, this is  the case for a very large selection of games but it does not cover all games. A  range of titles have very limited spatial features or restrict the virtual environ- ment to other representation forms. These titles will appear as references to  clarify  the  differences  and  to  provide  a  historic  frame  where  necessary,  but  they are not at the heart of this study.  At the same time, this book will try to avoid a number of possible mis- conceptions. Navigable 3D worlds possess speciﬁ c qualities and favor expres- sive  techniques  that  differ  from  other  formats.  Perhaps  we  can  blame  the  blanket term “multimedia” for an uncritical blending of different presentation  formats into “virtual spaces.” MUDs, 2D worlds, interactive cinema, and 3D  video games are too often treated as utilizing basically the same concept of   Introduction  5   “virtual space.” That can be a misleading simpliﬁ cation. There are fundamen- tal differences among a space described in a written text, a cinematic space,  and  an  interactive  navigable  virtual  world.  They  offer  different  forms  of  interactive  experiences  based  on  their  speciﬁ c  qualities.  Developing  these  differences will be one task ahead.  A  different  kind  of  mistake  is  found  in  some  commercial  approaches  to  virtual worlds. Here, space in video games serves too often as polygon-rich  spectacle and “eye candy” that remains largely unused in the actual gameplay.  It is time to revise this immature misconception and build new connections  along the way for further debate.  The purpose of the two self-imposed restrictions is to keep the focus on  the element of space in video games. Space—like time—is a principle at the  heart of Western as well as Eastern philosophy. The study of space enters into  numerous  disciplines,  so  that  we  will  be  able  to  draw  from  disciplines  as  diverse as  in alphabetical order  architecture, computer science, ﬁ lm studies,  game studies, media studies, narratology, philosophy, psychology, and many  more. All of these disciplines contribute to the analysis of video game spaces  but  they  cannot  all  be  covered  in  one  book.  While  this  book  can  easily  be  accused of missing important disciplinary afﬁ nities, it will assemble relevant  points  to  form  a  discussion  of  game  spaces  that  can  serve  as  basis  for  even  more speciﬁ c future work.  Such an interdisciplinary approach requires an understanding of different  terminologies and a clear deployment of them in the new context. It will be  one task to identify and adjust the different terminologies.  1.2  Structure, Presentation, and Functionality  Lefebvre breaks down social space into spatial practice, which secretes a certain  society  from  another;  representations  of  space,  which  is  “conceptualized  space,  the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social  engineers”  Lefebvre 1991, 38 ; and representational space, “space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols, and hence the space of ‘inhabit- ants’ and ‘users’ ”  ibid., 39 . His division informs the approach of this book  but the resulting structure grew more out of the ongoing analysis than from  an upfront subscription to Lefebvre’s theory.  3D graphics open up means of expression to the computer that add a new  dimension to their representation. The use of 3D navigable space changes the  textual qualities of video games and distances them in some way from other  interactive pieces that present their content in a less spatially deﬁ ned manner.  The ﬁ rst part of the book, on Structure, will look at how 3D space can reshape   Chapter 1  6   the textual qualities of video games. It ﬁ rst considers what the new textual  qualities  of  these  game  worlds  are  and  offers  deﬁ nitions  of  the  key  terms  “interaction” and “narrative” as two strongholds of games research and impor- tant factors in the way players make sense of the worlds presented to them.  The main focus rests on the idea of understanding space and movement therein  by ways of narrative comprehension. Narrative is seen as a form of understand- ing of the events a player causes, triggers, and encounters inside a video game  space. From this vantage point, part I reframes key principles of narratology  in the context of video game spaces before discussing quests as space-driven  content structures for these narrative elements. Presentation is understood as  the expressive element of video games. It grows from the necessary interpreta- tion of the processed rules and data into some form the player can read. Pre- sentation in current commercial video games uses predominantly audiovisual  components. Thus, the second part of the book concentrates on the roles of  the moving image and sound in video game spaces. The analysis looks more  speciﬁ cally into cinematic elements at work in video games with a focus on  the  construction  and  guided  comprehension  of  virtual  spaces.  Part  II  will  argue  that  different  forms  of  presentation  create  a  kind  of  narrative  ﬁ lter  through which player interaction is framed into speciﬁ c contexts. Important  factors  are  the  focalization  through  the  narration  and  the  guidance  of  the  player’s reading.  Functionality refers to the interactive access and underlying rules determin- ing what the player can do in the game space and what the space can do to  adjust that. Part III looks at the elements that shape the development of the  actions as they unfold in 3D worlds. Means of functionality are, for example,  artiﬁ cial intelligence  AI , complex rule systems, and interface design. These  topics have been discussed in other works to far greater length. The aim here  is to concentrate on the functionality of virtual 3D spaces. This leads to a focus  on architectural principles and the question of a player’s positioning within  the space. A line is drawn from various architectural principles to their actual  use in video games and the player’s interaction with them. Experiential effects  like immersion and presence are discussed to locate the player as active par- ticipant in the game world. We arrive at the idea of a social space, a place in  video games. The argument closes with a reference back to narrative, for those  social places are understood as narrative landscapes.  While part I differentiates 3D game spaces from other interactive media,  parts  II  and  III  are  more  focused  on  the  workings  of  video  game  spaces  as  such. Both are intrinsically different operational features of video games but  are closely intertwined and interdependent. It will be argued that the level of  presentation is a good example for the gradual development of video games   Introduction  7   and has become part of the functionality and accessible to the player. Realizing  the  combination  of  presentation  and  functionality  is  a  central  goal  and  the  underlying  principle  of  this  book.  Historically,  there  seems  to  be  a  rift  between the discussion of a game’s audiovisual presentation and its functional  interactive elements. But elements of spatial practice and mediation of space  are always closely interconnected. Space—virtual or real—has to be encoun- tered and interacted with. One has to explore the interaction and the media  that present it. Any concentration on either presentation or functionality but  not both would destroy the holistic principle of spatial experience. Thus, space  forces us to interconnect and build new bridges between two central poles in  game design and analysis.  1.3  What Space?  What is a video game space? The question has to be answered to avoid intro- ducing a nebulous concept to the core of this argument. The difﬁ culties in  describing  and  limiting  the  term  do  not  come  as  a  surprise.  The  spatial  is  connected to and debated in literally every possible arena of human thinking.  We cannot reduce such a holistic principle to any single frame or assume a  single  concept  of  “the  space.”  If  space  is  such  an  all-embracing  and  hard- to-restrain phenomenon, the task is not to reduce the term itself but to build  useful frameworks to approach the topic. One has to deﬁ ne the frame for the  speciﬁ c argument at hand and clarify its context. What are these spaces?  1.3.1  Simulating Theme Parks  Video game worlds are processed. They depend on algorithms and mathemati- cal  rules.  These  rules  and  processes  follow  certain  models,  which  makes  all  game spaces simulations. Creating these worlds from rules is a form of simula- tion  that  follows  a  preconceived  model.  But  that  statement  does  not  really  help us to understand video game spaces as the player experiences them.  Thanks to the freedom of the mathematical models, the resulting worlds  can  be  anything  anywhere,  which  makes  them  remarkably  indifferent  and  somewhat meaningless to start with. There is little given context or relevance  present at the origin of these worlds, neither a history nor a physical constraint  is given to the space itself. That is no problem from a mathematical vantage  point but it makes the resulting virtual spaces almost inaccessible for players.  One  has  to  be  a  trained  expert  to  deal  with  them.  In  order  to  project  the  necessary context into the game worlds and in order to make sense of them,  the  player  depends  on  a  legible  presentation  and  meaningful  functionality.  Players  can  overcome  the  nonspeciﬁ c  origins  of  these  spaces  with  the  help   Chapter 1  8   of  a  designer,  who  makes  the  game  worlds  accessible  through  interactive  options  and  shapes  their  mediation  in  speciﬁ c  ways.  The  simulation  of  an  atom bomb explosion in the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the explo- sion  of  the  “anomalous  materials”  in  Half-Life   The  Half-Life  Team  1998   have very different aims and work very differently as simulations. The same  rings  true  for  more  “realistic”  sim  games  like  Sid  Meier’s  work  or  detailed  driving games.  Yet,  the  same  research  labs  that  developed  the  atomic  bombs  famously  provided the Petri dish for modern video games. The Brookhaven National  Laboratory is part of the same Advanced Simulation and Computing program  as, for example, the Los Alamos simulation unit. Both labs were founded to  explore pressing research questions in the “hard” sciences. Nevertheless, about  half a century ago, Brookhaven National Laboratory was the birthplace of the  ﬁ rst documented video game: Tennis for Two  Higinbotham 1958 , a prelude  to Pong. The relationship between the armed forces and the game industry in  the United States has been continuous ever since, inviting the term “military- entertainment complex”  Lenoir 2003 . But tracing games only back to war  simulations would be too simplistic.  Unlike the data-driven scientiﬁ c simulation models, which aim to deliver  reliable ﬁ ndings, accurate training conditions, and highly elaborate answers  to very speciﬁ c scientiﬁ c problems, games are centered on the dramatic experi- ence. They do not provide new knowledge through the execution of their code  but  instead  present  engaging  questions.  The  necessary  dramatization  leads  to a different kind of product that concentrates not on the data, but on the  player.  America’s  Army:  Operations   Capps  2002   is  a  ﬁ rst-person  shooter  game  developed  for  the  U.S.  Army  and  based  on  Epic’s  Unreal  engine.  It  was  intended as a publicity and possible recruitment tool and seems to simulate  an  army  boot  camp,  training  missions,  and  real  combat  situations.  Its  rule  system might copy military concepts but the way these rules get compromised  through the spectacle of the game illustrates more the tendency of the military  complex to embrace the game community than vice versa. In order to raise  its appeal, America’s Army had to simplify and streamline the education of a  soldier,  emphasize  the  dramatic  combat  scenarios,  and  give  up  the  total  control over such training. It remains impossible to track the development of  loyalty, duty, respect, selﬂ ess service, honor, integrity, and personal courage  in  a  world  with  free  chat  options  and  the  default  “ﬁ re  at  will”  setting.  In  addition,  hacks  for  avoiding  the  game’s  initial  and  more  rigidly  controlled  training  phase  were  available  shortly  after  its  release  as  players  started  to  utilize their new toy and tweaked it to meet their demands. As a simulation   Introduction  9   America’s Army is of value mainly for tracking social behavior of gamers, not  for military training purposes.  That is why America’s Army serves as a political platform for Joseph DeLappe  in  his  dead-in-iraq  project,  which  he  calls  “a  ﬂ eeting,  online  memorial”   DeLappe 2006 . In this memorial, DeLappe logs into America’s Army game  sessions as a player named “dead-in-iraq” and uses the chat function to type  in  the  names  of  U.S.  soldiers  who  have  died  in  Iraq.  The  underlying  rule  system remains active but its use is subverted. In the case of America’s Army, such subversion is relatively easy because its title makes the game designer’s  intention  obvious.  At  the  same  time,  the  America’s  Army  website  also  sells  game-related action ﬁ gures of decorated war heroes that represent a very dif- ferent  and  less  critical  memorial  of  military  operations.  Political  activism  obviously works both ways.  But  even  if  the  game  is  based  on  more  complex  simulation  models,  the  author of the game simulation still directs the simulation  Frasca 2003  and  this inﬂ uence cannot be free of an interpretative stand that includes ideological  patterns  Bogost 2006 . These differences between scientiﬁ c simulations and  games are not only on the level of the creator and code; they also reside on  the side of the player. Players engage with video games not like scientists that  operate a simulation program. They often suspend disbelief when activating  a  game  and  they  usually  lack  an  analytical  distance  to  the  data.  Neither  behavior is allowed in a scientiﬁ c community. But what games provide is a  reposition of the player into the “active” spot.  Through the loophole of virtual space we are able to reclaim the space of  the action where we do not “look at” but actively visit the center of the action.  When the player’s game avatar Gordon Freeman pushes the “anomalous mate- rial” into the particle beam deep inside the Black Mesa Research Facility in  Half-Life and causes a chain reaction, he remains at the heart of the disaster  and has to handle it. The player has to handle it, therefore, because the player  handles  Gordon.  We  are  not  analyzing  the  events  as  neutral  onlookers  but  share  the  space  with  them  and  have  to  ﬁ nd  our  way  out  of  the  exploding  chamber and the resulting mayhem. The game might stage the player in the  role of a research scientist, like Gordon Freeman who is introduced as a virtual  MIT graduate, but involvement with the unfolding events is not a scientiﬁ c  research project. It is a fast-paced action adventure. When Valve included a  better physics model into Half-Life 2, this model is neither stable enough nor  intended to be a solid representation of the real world, but most notably adds  to the ﬁ ghting variety in the game.  If games are simulations, then they are social playgrounds based on given  rule sets, but even these set of rules are bound to crack under the pressure of   Chapter 1  10   the player community. Play supports behavioral studies and the bending of  the rules might produce the best results for a scientiﬁ c simulation. But even  here it is difﬁ cult to relate the player’s actions back to real-world behavior.  When Blizzard added the Zul’Gurub dungeon to the virtual world of Azeroth  that is the setting for World of Warcraft  Pardo and Adham 2004 , a special  ﬁ ghting move of an enemy at the end of one of the new quests introduced a  virtual plague to the game world. The “virus” was transmitted over virtual  pets  as  well  as  non-player  characters  and  player-avatars.  It  spread  quickly  throughout the virtual world and led to the display of some real world behav- ior  in  the  player  community.  In  many  ways,  the  resulting  player  behavior  in  the  virtual  world  mirrored  our  behavior  in  the  real  world.  Players  did  heal each other, for example, to contain the plague. Researchers have already  experimented with multiplayer game worlds to teach and investigate disease  control   Neulight  and  Kafai  2005 .  Yet  again,  direct  transfer  of  the  World of  Warcraft  plague  event  to  real-world  behavior  is  impossible,  for  on  the  one hand the game is limited in scope and on the other hand it differs in key  criteria of human behavior. For example, infected World of Warcraft players  could “teleport” into the middle of large cities and infect others on purpose,  making  containment  impossible.  Whoever  “died”  because  of  the  virus  was  instantly reborn, which rendered the plague into an exciting in-game event  instead of a terrible tragedy—it also allowed for a different playing behavior.  Players  could  retaliate  for  being  infected  and  the  plague  could  turn  into  a  subgame in the game.  Other multiplayer worlds host growing player-driven economies that can  become highly complex. A number of problems have been caused by player  behavior  that  concentrates  on  an  optimized  economical  development.  For  example, players started “mining” in-game resources. They concentrated their  whole  game  efforts  on  gathering  valuables  in  the  game  world  to  sell  them  outside the game environment for cash. Others steal property or control over  player-avatars.  Others  again  exploit  in-game  bugs.  Real-world  ﬁ scal  issues,  such as inﬂ ation, are also present in multiplayer game worlds. That is why  CCP Games, which runs the online world Eve Online, has hired an in-game  economist. He observes the development of the in-game economy to analyze  and steer the impact of any changes. “After we opened up an area where there  was more zydrine  an in-game mineral , we saw that price dropped. We did  not announce that there was more explicitly, but in a matter of days the price  had adjusted”  S. Hillis 2007 .  All of these activities can have real ﬁ nancial impact as the virtual riches  often  translate  into  goods  that  can  be  sold  for  real  money.  Through  their  hard-cash  value,  these  events  have  impact  on  the  complex  network  of  real   Introduction  11   economics. In November 2006, Ailin Graef, a prominent ﬁ gure in Second Life, who earns real money in virtual real estate deals and other in-game businesses,  announced that she had acquired more than $1 million through her online  activities   anshechung.com  2006 .  The  result  of  such  activity  is  a  gradual  merging of two complex systems: the rule-driven and social networks of the  game world and economic systems of the real world. It is here that the value  of  games  as  simulations  becomes  relevant,  precisely  because  these  worlds  expand  beyond  their  rule-driven  origins—because  they  break  their  original  simulation frame.  On  the  level  of  presentation  and  engagement,  the  simulation  remains  a  technology that often gets hacked, tweaked, and compromised by players. A  scientiﬁ c simulation has to limit error margins and aim for certain neutrality  with the highest possible data density to provide valuable outcomes. In con- trast, games present their world in the most appealing way to attract players,  insofar as they are simulations that dream of Hollywood, the Cirque du Soleil,  TV commercials, the Taj Mahal, or Las Vegas. 3D graphics fuel that dream  with a more and more elaborate form of presentation. While players in Tennis for Two looked on the playing ground, modern 3D worlds take us into the  event space and onto the stage.  The Back to the Future ride was a main attraction of the Universal Studios  entertainment park in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s. The LA ride had only  opened in 1993 and combined ﬂ ight simulation techniques and OMNIMAX  cinema projection in an elaborate audiovisual and haptic spectacle. Instead of  entering the airplane cockpit, visitors stepped into an oversized time-traveling  DeLorean to race through different time periods in a great spectacle directed  by  Douglas  Trumball  and  driven  by  Industrial  Light  and  Magic’s  effects.  I  had to wait about half an hour in a queue before I could even enter the build- ing that housed the main attraction. To sweeten the bitter pill of waiting, the  designers  had  multiple  monitors  and  various  movie-related  paraphernalia  installed along the queue. The closer the visitor came to the main attraction,  the more one was surrounded by the ﬁ ctional universe created in the Back to  the  Future  movies.  I  found  myself  slowly  fading  into  the  Back  to  the  Future universe  that  gradually  replaced  the  “reality”  of  the  theme  park.  When  I  ﬁ nally  reached  the  last  waiting  line  that  separated  the  visitors  into  smaller  groups—each of them about to enter the pneumatic technical wonders of the  ride itself—I was already inside the Back to the Future world, thanks to the  surrounding artifacts and the expectations of the upcoming ride. Promising  rumbling, mufﬂ ed music, and the screams of visitors who were just experienc- ing the excitement on the other side of the doors, combined to produce an   Chapter 1  12   overwhelming soundscape that was all part of the attraction. At that point,  the  ground  started  to  shake.  Alarm  bells  added  to  the  overall  excitement.  Flashing lights went off on various corners. The doors sprang open and guides  in uniforms hurried us along short hallways. We were about to experience the  latest thrill ride on the planet—not quite.  We went right through the building and out on the other side. Only there,  blinking  at  the  bright  sunlight,  along  with  other  confused  visitors,  did  I  slowly realize a minor earthquake had struck the park. What I had experienced  as part of the attraction was, in fact, nature’s disruption of it. The ﬁ ctional  disaster ride had become the very real scene of danger  albeit minor  and reality  had played its tricks on the virtual. It had reclaimed its space.  Like game spaces, theme park attractions create an expertly directed sense  of place and context in a ﬁ ctional universe within the shortest possible time.  The Back to the Future attraction did not consist solely of the main ride’s few  minutes’  duration  but  also  of  the  experience  of  waiting,  the  gradual  drift  into the unreal world of the attraction. Theme parks have been recognized by  the  game  community  as  important  references   Carson  2000   and  discussed  by a number of researchers  Darley 2000; Manovich 2001; Ndalianis 2004 .  But there are fundamental differences between the two space types. The ﬁ c- tional space of a video game is an imagined space that lacks the physical and  nature-dependent quality of theme parks. My earthquake experience could not  have happened in the game version of the ride as presented in the GameCube  video game Universal Studios Theme Park Adventure  Okuhara 2001 . The game  version of the Back to the Future attraction consists of a racing game featuring  a chase—as does the theme park version—but the game uses it merely as an  occasion to provide a whole range of other effects closer to an interactive racing  game,  far  removed  from  the  physicality  of  the  original  attraction.  If  a  real  quake  would  occur  in  the  play  space  that  houses  the  GameCube  and  my  real  body,  no  virtual  ushers  would  hush  me  along  polygonal  hallways  into  virtual  safety.  The  play  space  in  the  real  Universal  Studios  and  that  in  the  video game differ widely in the way they connect the material world and the  ﬁ ctional one.  Another difference between rides and games grows out of these very real  security  issues  for  life  and  safety:  theme  park  rides  restrict  exploration  and  interaction in order to control the balance of sensations. While players of 3D  video games can explore vast virtual landscapes and learn how to master move- ment in 3D, theme park rides are by and large linear experiences with no or  little interactive access. The player controls the hands and arms of the game  character  and  “reaches”  into  the  game  world.  In  contrast,  visitors  to  theme   Introduction  13   park rides have little chance of interference with the optimized sensual spec- tacle they are “riding.” In the Space Mountain attraction in Disneyland Paris,  visitors literally ride the bullet with no means of interaction whatsoever. The  Space  Mountain  attraction  offers  an  action-packed  version  of  Jules  Verne’s  Voyage dans la Lune that explicitly asks the visitors to “keep your arms and  hands inside the vehicle all time.” It is part of the concept that control in the  peak moments of the attraction is not in the hands of the to-be-overwhelmed  visitor but in those of the designer and engineer.  Theme  park  attractions  that  offer  some  form  of  meaningful  interaction,  like DisneyQuest’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold  Fitzgerald  and  Garlington  2001 ,  turn  more  toward  augmented  reality   AR   games.  Schell and Shochet argue that these mixed forms are neither games nor rides,  but  a  new  medium.  They  draw  a  line  between  theme  park  attraction  and  interactive  virtual  reality   VR   pieces   Schell  and  Shochet  2001 .  Battle  for  Buccaneer Gold is, in fact, an interactive piece modeled after the classic—and  far more linear—Disneyland attraction, Pirates of the Caribbean. It is not a copy  of the attraction but a more game-like in its own right installation. Like the  ﬁ lm  version,  Pirates  of  the  Caribbean:  The  Curse  of  the  Black  Pearl   Verbinski  2003 ,  which  was  inspired  by  the  same  attraction,  the  VR  installation  is  a  different media format.  Finally, theme park attractions often use elaborate interfaces  Pausch et al.  1996; Mine 2003  that differ signiﬁ cantly from consumer-level video games  and their interaction design. While any attraction in a theme park is situated  in the middle of a corporate entertainment complex and visitors stream from  one waiting line to the next, most of the video games discussed here run on  home entertainment systems. That means they are played at home, in a famil- iar environment and with a very different interface predisposition. A theme  park ride game such as Sim Theme Park  Harris, Leinfellner, and Nuttall 2000   includes  a  remediation  of  the  ride  experience,  but  mainly  as  a  test  of  the  player’s  building  skills.  It  ends  up  being  a  reward,  much  like  a  cutscene.  Although this quotes the sensual spectacle of a real rollercoaster, it does so in  the second instance through the eye of a virtual camera. In other titles such  as the original RollerCoaster Tycoon  Sawyer 1999 , the managing of the park  is the sole core of the gameplay and we see again the game-based version of  a simulation.  In order to discuss video game spaces, we need a method that allows us to  distinguish between the various spaces: one precise enough to spawn the dis- cussion  and  allow  for  clear  differentiation  between  game  spaces  and  other  spaces; but also one that is scaleable enough to support more detailed critique  of a game world.  Chapter 1  14   1.3.2  Five Planes  Theorists have offered a range of approaches for analyzing video games. Each  of these approaches deﬁ nes a different set of layers or planes for understanding  how games function  Konzack 2002; Montfort 2006 . Any such a layering has  to  be  selective,  because  game  studies  are  free  to  explore  any  game-related  aspect and no model can provide all possible approaches upfront. The selection  here was made with a view toward the experience of space. If “cyberspace is  a representation of human beings’ space experience”  Qvortrup 2002, 23  and  we  continue  such  a  phenomenological  approach,  then  the  system  has  to  be  able to answer to how we perceive the space, how we are positioned in relation  to it, and the way we practice with this space. In order to address these issues,  the model suggested here distinguishes between ﬁ ve main conceptual planes  for the analysis of game spaces:  Figure 1.1  Five analytical planes  These planes are  rule-based space as deﬁ ned by the mathematical rules that set, for example,   1. physics, sounds, AI, and game-level architecture;  Introduction  15   ﬁ ctional  space  that  lives  in  the  imagination,  in  other  words,  the  space   2. mediated  space  as  deﬁ ned  by  the  presentation,  which  is  the  space  of  the  image  plane  and  the  use  of  this  image  including  the  cinematic  form  of  presentation; 3. “imagined” by players from their comprehension of the available images; 4. video game hardware; and 5. other players affected  e.g., in a multiplayer title .  play space, meaning space of the play, which includes the player and the   social space deﬁ ned by interaction with others, meaning the game space of   All ﬁ ve are conceptual planes that have their own qualities and deﬁ ne them- selves  through  different  elements.  Yet  in  order  to  provide  a  ﬂ uent  gaming  experience, they all have to work in combination.  The rule-based space is deﬁ ned by the code, the data, and hardware restric- tions. It is the world of the functional restrictions that often mirror architec- tural structuring of video game spaces. This world is the basis for the mediated space,  which  consists  of  all  the  output  the  system  can  provide  in  order  to  present the rule-based game universe to the player. In the case of commercial  video games this layer consists mainly of audiovisual and tactile output that  provides a form of presentation. The player is confronted with this presenta- tion and imagines a world from the provided information—the ﬁ ctional space. Based on the ﬁ ctional world players decide on actions to affect the game space.  As long as players continue this engagement, they form a designated space in  the physical world that includes the player and the gaming system—the play space. Finally, actions in the virtual world can affect the spaces of other players  on  the  layer  of  social  space.  The  planes  offer  an  analytical  framework  and  a  perspective to approach the question of game spaces. At the same time, they  are scaleable. Each plane could be broken down into more subsections for a  ﬁ ner granularity of analysis.  Others have suggested different but related categories for the understand- ing of space. Traces of those approaches remain in this game-space model. For  example, Lefebvre distinguishes between “spatial practice”  closest to the rule- based space , “represented space”  closest to the mediated space , and repre- sentational space  which can be read as a combination of ﬁ ctional, play, and  social spaces toward an existential whole   Lefebvre 2001 . Others have chosen  to focus on speciﬁ c planes. Cinematic space has been discussed, for example,  by Heath  1976  and Branigan  1992 , whose ﬁ ndings mainly apply to the  mediated space. Huinzinga suggested the concept of the “magic circle” that  separates  the  world  of  the  player  from  the  not-playing  surrounding  world.  Game  studies  have  adopted  some  of  these  philosophies   e.g.,  L.  N.  Taylor   Chapter 1  16   2002 for a reference to Lefebvre; Wolf 2002 for cinematic space; Salen and  Zimmerman 2003 for Huinzinga  and started to investigate possible relation- ships between separate planes  e.g., Juul 2005 for the relationship between  rule-based  and  ﬁ ctional  space .  Konzack   2002   and  Montfort   2006   offer  relating planes with a different focus and call for an analysis that interconnects  them. Following such a layering, the argument here will try to make connec- tions among all ﬁ ve of these spaces. None of these layers alone is enough to  support a rich game world. That is why the argument will concentrate not  on a separation between these layers but on their interconnections and overlaps  to understand how they work in combination.  The two main forces that connect all layers are the two basic streams of  presentation, which leads to comprehension and motivation, and functional- ity, which allows for interactive access and active game worlds. Functionality  and  presentation  are  the  two  forces  that  constantly  interlink  the  different  planes to bring game spaces to life. Instead of focusing on any single plane,  we will look at the forces that interconnect them all. Ultimately, the division  into ﬁ ve principal spaces for video games provides an orientation map from  which  the  argument  can  embark.  It  also  helps  to  concentrate  on  the  given  topic of game space.  1.3.3  Cyberspace and Text Spaces  One  debate  that  provides  insight  in  video  game  space  concerns  cyberspace.  Discussing cyberspace within any scope is difﬁ cult. The term was derived from  ﬁ ction and never totally shed the element of the ﬁ ctitious. Although there are  conceptual parallels, today’s internet does not work or look like the original  vision of cyberspace as William Gibson introduced it in 1984, yet the term  seems to work as a reference to the web and numerous other digital formats.  From  the  vantage  point  of  space  and  spatial  experience,  the  conﬂ ation  of  Gibson’s cyberspace with the internet is questionable. Data space and navi- gable 3D space do not have to be the same; in fact, they rarely are. Data can  be presented and processed in many different ways: as 2D webpages, mathe- matical  models,  descriptive  text,  or  soundscapes,  for  example.  It  was  only  logical that the idea of a singular all-embracing cyberspace had to break down  into smaller and more speciﬁ c segments once virtual worlds became available  en masse in video games. Once more specialized studies emerged, the idea of  a singular information space gave way to countless smaller spaces. Today there  is not one form of cyberspace.  When  Dodge  and  Kitchin  introduce  their  work  on  the  mapping  of  cyberspace,  they  point  out  that  “at  present,  cyberspace  does  not  consist  of  one homogenous space; it is a myriad of rapidly expanding cyberspaces, each   Introduction  17   providing a different form of digital interaction and communication”  2001,  1 . Consequently, they include maps of continuous 3D worlds such as Alpha- Worlds as well as nodal networks of internet connections and website struc- tures. Since then things have become even messier with user-generated worlds  from Counter-Strike levels to Second Life and Spore.  However, the discussion of cyberspace offers a gateway for a lot of relevant  work on virtual spaces that can serve as key references for video game spaces.  Many  of  these  arguments  remain  valuable  but  need  a  readjustment  to  the  speciﬁ cs of 3D video game worlds.  Benedikt’s  seminal  Cyberspace,  First  Steps   1991   contributes  a  range  of  perspectives to the new phenomenon. A whole body of work on cyberspace in  the 1990s started the discussion of important issues: spiritual and theological   e.g., Heim 1993, 1998; Wertheim 2000 , architectural  e.g., Novak 1996b;  D.  A.  Campbell  1996 ,  political   like  Barlow’s  “A  Declaration  of  Indepen- dence  of  Cyberspace,”  1996 ,  social   e.g.,  Rheingold  1991,  1993 ,  cultural   e.g., Anders 1998 , theatrical  e.g., Schrum 1999 , and the questions of text,  reader, and author that overlapped with some discussions in hypertext  e.g.,  Bolter 2001; Bolter and Grusin 1996 . Most of these approaches will reappear  and inform the discussion.  From the earliest days of video games, the medium was driven by graphic  representation tied to rule-based processing. Titles such as Spacewar!  Graetz  and Russell 1961  or Tennis for Two—arguably among the ﬁ rst video games  in the sense that they could not have been realized outside the computer— featured graphics that became classics for later clones. Their representational  form  and  interactive  design  did  not  derive  from  the  literary  textuality  in  a  literal sense, but rather from spatial realization. In Spacewar, two player-con- trolled  spaceships  try  to  destroy  each  other  with  torpedoes,  while  avoiding  collision with a central star that slowly pulls them into its gravity ﬁ eld. The  gameplay grows from very basic rules that are implemented in very limited  code  9 K , but it remains rich and variable for the player because these rules  are realized in a virtual space that seems to open nearly endless permutations.  For example, experienced players often used the gravity of the central star in  their opening maneuver. They let themselves be pulled toward the star while  shooting at the other spaceship. When performed by both players, the maneu- ver  generated  a  shape  not  unlike  the  CBS  logo—and  thus  was  termed  the  “CBS opening”  Graetz 1981 .  Unlike other opening moves, for example in chess or in the initial stages  of a MUD, Spacewar simulates physical forces and an in-world timeframe that  shape the game universe. Other nondigital formats, like pen and paper role- playing games, can try to simulate spatial behavior and map it onto their rule   Chapter 1  18   systems, but it is difﬁ cult to match the precision of the computer in the way  it  handles  spatial  representation  and  functionality.  Exact  measurement  and  orientation can be difﬁ cult variables in pen and paper games that need sig- niﬁ cant simpliﬁ cation, for example in the form of simpliﬁ ed locations on the  board. As a consequence, a lot of early video games emphasized their speciﬁ c  advantage in the use of space. For example, the ﬁ rst mass-produced commer- cial  arcade  game  Computer  Space   Bushnell  and  Dabney  1971   brought  the  simulation of the spaceﬂ ight to the foreground.  Once the game world expanded into 3D, the precision of the represented  space became the basis of many more game formats. Collisions, spatial rela- tions of bodies to each other, audiovisual representations of the environment,  interaction with objects in the world and with the world itself—all necessarily  highlight the spatial qualities of the game. How, then, do these qualities differ  from other digital formats such as hypertext?  One  way  to  approach  video  games  is  to  look  for  the  deﬁ ning  units  of  meaning within them. Looking for textual units mainly in text-driven games,  Aarseth distinguishes between scriptons as “strings [of signs] as they appear to  readers” and textons as “strings as they exist in the text”  1997, 62 . “A scrip- ton, then, is an unbroken sequence of one of more textons as they are projected  by the text”  Aarseth 1994, 60 . While Aarseth’s scriptons are the signs de  facto delivered to the user, he distinguishes them from the Barthesian lexia. Barthes  deﬁ nes  lexia  as  “brief,  contiguous  fragments  .  .  .  units  of  reading”   1974, 13  that refer more to Aarseth’s textons. In reference to this division,  hypertext theorists divide hypertextual works into lexias—the individual data  segment available at a certain node—and interconnecting links  e.g., Landow  1992 . The overall structure of both can result in a possible rhizome of inter- connected data. The hypertext piece afternoon, a story     Joyce 1987 , for example,  consists of 539 lexia and 950 links that form a complex network of intercon- nections. Interactive ﬁ ction, a relative to hypertext, can generate the text and  thus might be less restrictive but still depends on descriptive textual segments   see,  e.g.,  Montfort  2003 .  These  can  be  arranged  in  various  ways  to  form  networks of lexia with different levels of complexity  Ryan 2001b . Yet none  of these levels reaches the diverse range of a 3D space.  Breaking down a 3D game space in comparable units is nearly impossible.  The  options  offered  in  a  3D  navigable  interactive  game  world  include  countless  opportunities,  possible  positions,  and  directions.  They  cannot  be  separated into a deﬁ nite number of textons. Rules and deﬁ nitions might apply  to  each  element,  but  the  combination  and  dynamics  between  objects  and  worlds make such a breakdown impossible. Any movement in any direction  at  any  point  and  any  speciﬁ c  interaction  at  that  point  change  the  world’s   Introduction  19   condition.  Fighting  games  like  the  Tekken, Virtua  Fighter,  or  Dead  or  Alive series depend on such an optimized combination of spatial control and speciﬁ c  ﬁ ght moves. Any small change in a pattern might be the difference between  glorious victory and miserable failure and will trigger a different move of the  opponent.  The  interactive  options  as  such  are  limited:  spatial  navigation,  blocking, and attacking moves. Their realization is unique due to their use  inside the game world and their dependency on the other character’s actions.  Instead of single nodes, game spaces put the emphasis on the forces between  innumerable  states  and  describe  them  in  minute  detail.  Elements  such  as  speed and direction are implemented in high detail and realized with great  effect in the game world.  For the space creation in ﬁ lm, Chatman distinguishes between the “literal”  story space in cinema, “that is, objects, dimensions and relations are analogous,  at least two-dimensionally, to those in the real world”  1978, 96–97  and the  “abstract” space in verbal narrative “requiring a reconstruction in the mind”   ibid. . In this regard, games are at least as “literal” as ﬁ lm. Virtual set design,  lighting,  visualization,  and  spatial  sound  design  have  become  important  ingredients  in  the  development  and  experience  of  virtual  worlds.  In  the  context of video games, these options have changed the process of writing or  reading a text into a process of designing or exploring a space. The creator  becomes a “spacemaker”  Walser cited from Rheingold 1991, 286  or “narra- tive architect”  Jenkins 2004, 129  and the player an explorer and conqueror  of  space.  In  order  to  identify  game  spaces’  speciﬁ c  features,  the  theorist  as  well as the practitioner must look at their spatiality that distinguishes them  from literary pieces such as MUDs, which use spatial metaphors for orienta- tion but consist of literary representation that offer different functionality and  presentation.  Written texts have a spatial quality but their description of space differs  signiﬁ cantly from the games discussed here. Moving through 3D audiovisual  video game spaces is intrinsically different from interacting with a hypertext  that uses conditional links to let the user create a path or reading through the  available node elements. When clicking on a hypertext link, the user cannot  predict the direction she will take. In fact, it is part of the pleasure of reading   navigating   a  hypertext  such  as  Joyce’s  Twilight:  A  Symphony   1996   to  succumb to his expertise in the writing of each node and his careful arrange- ment of available text elements. Clicking on any hyperlink generates a unique  reading path through the piece, but the reader’s sense of control is limited  because one cannot predict what the next move might be or where the link  might lead.  Chapter 1  20   Video  game  spaces  are  far  more  descriptive  and  graphically  deﬁ ned  and  have developed to a stage where they contain numerous spatial references and  details. In fact, they can overwhelm us with these references. They can be so  detailed that they trap us in their perfection and their presentation can become  too  ﬂ awless,  too  clean.  They  reach  the  uncanny  valley  where  the  distance  between nature and virtual world become reemphasized by the gradual prog- ress  toward  photorealistic  rendering.  The  ﬁ rst  demo  I  saw  running  on  the  PlayStation 2 presented a virtual forest that spread into sheer inﬁ nity—too  pixel-perfect to look alive.  Ultimately,  3D  game  spaces  remain  part  of  the  computer  as  media,  and  the basic textual machine that is responsible for the generation of the game  text applies to them. Game spaces and other interactive media formats rely  on the player to provide input and a system of rules that processes and reacts  to this input. But game spaces differ from other interactive media formats in  their textual units, the way they are generated by designers, and the way they  are experienced by players.  Video  game  spaces  share  qualities  with  simulations,  theme  park  rides,  cyberspace, and hypertext worlds. In fact, they can be seen as simulators or a  subsection of digital space, depending on the preferences of the analyst. But  they offer different assemblies of the ﬁ ve deﬁ ning spatial planes. These differ- ences might be gradual—as seen in the game characteristics of the Pirates of  the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold—but traceable. The ﬁ eld of video game  spaces as they are discussed here is deﬁ ned by the two limitations previously  outlined:  only  games  that  are  available  on  consumer  hardware,  only  games  that  offer  navigable  3D  environments.  We  will  look  at  this  ﬁ eld  with  the  model of the ﬁ ve planes as our analytical framework interconnected by pre- sentation and functionality. The book will proceed with a discussion of these  spaces’ qualities and operational forces.  Introduction  21    I  Structure  The connection among the ﬁ ve analytical planes demands some form of struc- ture for game spaces. Key terms such as “rules,” “narrative,” “interactivity,”  and “space” all provide different methods to provide for this structure. The  problem is that these terms have been overused and, occasionally, misused in  games research. Thus, part I will begin with a clearer deﬁ nition of how these  terms are applied here. Once the individual elements of this framework are  deﬁ ned, we combine them and revisit various elements of narrative structure  in game worlds to see how they can be applied to a game’s spatial qualities.    2  Games and Rules  There is a clear difference between the call for structure and rules that build  the framework of the game on the one hand and the play and comprehension  that  form  the  gaming  experience  itself  on  the  other.  Players  “play”  with  data  and  generate  unique  permutations,  but  the  game’s  code  sets  its  own  “rules”  to  structure  the  play.  “Code  is  the  law”   Mitchell  1999,  50 .  The  computer becomes an embodiment of law and the programmer a “lawgiver”   Weizenbaum in Walker 1994, 230 . This refers to the programmer as the  author of the rule-based space. This plane, together with the emerging ﬁ eld  of platform studies, is immensely important for the discussion of game spaces.  Both what the interactor sees and what can be interacted with are processed  by the code. But rules do not solely apply to the plane of the rule-based space  and not every structural element of a game can be described on that level.  Alan  Kay  approached  computers  not  as  tools  but  as  media,  which  often  hide the operational logic of the code under a layer of representation that is  easier for a non-expert user to understand  1990, 193 . Video games are espe- cially  good  examples  of  this  media  quality.  The  generation  of  experiential  video game space is a direct offspring of this philosophy. Players of a video  game do not look at the underlying code but at dynamically generated audio- visual and tactile results based on it. They look at the mediated plane and see  the  performance  of  the  code.  The  code  itself  stays  hidden  behind  elaborate  virtual  worlds  and  interfaces,  and  the  only  time  one  might  encounter  it  is  when an error crashes the program and a debug message points to certain lines  of broken code. Players do not have to understand the logic of the code but  of the mediated game world. “Beyond the fantasy, there are always the rules,”  argues Turkle  1984, 83 , but from the vantage point of a player’s experience,    it is the ﬁ ctional plane where the player makes sense of the game, the space  of personal interpretation and assessment.  Overwhelmingly, most game players stay on the level of the fantasy world  when playing a video game. For example, they would not realize the funda- mental logical difference between a version of Pac-Man  Iwatani 1980  running  on  the  original  Z80  microprocessor  of  the  arcade  board  or  a  Java  or  C+  + version of the game emulated on a Pentium processor under Windows. At the  level of the code, both forms are completely different, but the player concen- trates on the mediated plane and stays oblivious of the intricacies of object- oriented programming. The code level stays hidden unless it jumps into the  foreground and causes unexpected behavior. In the case of Pac-Man, this refers  to the ﬁ nal, 256th level that produces a virtually unplayable split-screen maze  due to the hexadecimal-level counting in the code. The intricacies of the rule- based  plane  invade  the  mediated  plane,  and  the  game  becomes  virtually  unplayable.  Another example of the code’s reappearance in the ﬁ ctional game world led  to the “Furrer trick,” named after Eric Furrer, who still holds the record in  nonstop Space  Invaders  play  at  thirty-eight  hours  and  thirty-seven  minutes.  Furrer discovered that if one blew up a certain alien ship with a speciﬁ c shot   the  twenty-second  or  fourteenth,  depending  on  the  state  of  the  game   the   Figure 2.1 Pac-Man: the 256th board or “ﬁ nal level”  Wikipedia 2008   Chapter 2  26   game awarded more extra points than it did in other circumstances. Again,  this discovery exceeds the ﬁ ctional game world through inappropriate addi- tional extra points awarded by the way the random number generator works.  But  while  Pac-Man’s  256th  board  renders  the  game  virtually  unplayable  beyond that ﬁ nal level, the Furrer trick at least does not interfere with the  game ﬂ ow and thus keeps the game universe intact. Power players like Furrer  are “grokking” a game, as they take in every detail of its performance until  they share its mathematical logic. However, they still lack access or under- standing of the overall code. We still cannot tell why the Furrer trick works  without looking at the code itself.  2.1  Players Making Rules  As game worlds become increasingly complex, their developers face more and  more  potential  imbalances.  Especially,  massively  multiplayer  online  role- playing games face the danger of some users exploiting certain bugs. In their  “rules  of  conduct”  concerning  player  interaction  and  activity  in  Star  Wars  Galaxies: An Empire Divided  Koster and Barnes 2003 , Sony, the operator of  this  online  world,  explicitly  forbids  the  use  of  bugs,  including  those  “that  grant the user unnatural or unintended beneﬁ ts in-game”  SOE 2007, entry  15631 . In that statement, the “lawgiver” acknowledges possible “unnatural  or unintended” elements in the game world. These do not necessarily have to  be  game  bugs  that  would  crash  the  system.  More  often,  they  are  loopholes  opened up by speciﬁ c player behavior and exploit an imbalance in the system,  for example, to gain more virtual riches faster. Rules appear far more nego- tiable in an environment that acknowledges the existence of those imbalances.  Players should be “fair” as the borderlines between socially accepted behavior  and logical coded rules start to blur. In fact, designers of the earliest graphical  multiplayer  worlds  had  to  learn  that  “detailed  central  planning  is  impossible”  Morningstar and Farmer 1991, 285; italics in original . In particular, interac- tions between players can take utterly unpredicted turns that simply cannot  be predesigned and thus cannot be taken care of at code level. Even if the code  seems solid, there are too many unpredictable variables at work.  In a much-discussed event during the beta test of the Ultima Online world   Koster,  Delashmit,  and  Phillips  1997 ,  the  game  series’  creator,  Richard  Garriott, held an assembly where his über-avatar, Lord British, addressed a  group of players. At that occasion, one player managed to kill Lord British,  the  mighty  monarch  of  the  ﬁ ctional  game  world.  The  event  illustrated  unexpected social in-game behavior on the part of the player as well as Lord  British’s entourage, which retaliated immediately; it also was a glitch in the   Games and Rules  27   running system. The avatar Lord British should have been “ﬂ agged” as inde- structible, but lacked this attribute due to a server reboot shortly before the  event. After the reboot, a system administrator forgot to reset this ﬂ ag.  Code is fundamentally important but it is not the single operational law  in game spaces where unexpected game behavior emerges from the playing  community. Because games are played and player-modiﬁ ed, they are systems  open for transgressive, emergent play.  Emergent  play  is  a  good  example  for  the  complexities  of  video  game  textuality.  It  deviates  from  the  original  game  settings  and  can  develop  to  highly  advanced,  self-deﬁ ned  communities  and  structures.  Kücklich  points  toward  game  editor  programs  and  avatar  customization  that  go  beyond  the immediate game. He addresses the fundamental issue of rules and indi- cates a promising direction for a possible structuring of the outcome of the  processes, but his argument that “we can then deﬁ ne the text as a set of rules  that governs the ﬁ ctional world of the game, whereas the game itself is merely  an  individual  reading  of  this  text”   2001,  51   does  not  cover  the  possible  bending of the rule.  Game modiﬁ cation  MOD  communities represent one culture that often  redeﬁ nes  game  rules.  They  modify  a  game  engine’s  rules  and  assets  to  suit  their special gaming interests and create new forms of games based on existing  ones. The immensely successful Half-Life modiﬁ cation Counter-Strike adapted  many of the original games’ features in its reshaping of the game. What the  modiﬁ ers added was a new setting, a standoff between terrorists and counter- terrorists; new content, including uniforms, levels, weapons, and sounds; and  new rules, mainly in the different setups of the conﬂ ict. Players generate their  own  game  spaces  and  often  change  the  basic  rules  of  the  underlying  game  depending  on  how  accessible  these  rules  are.  But  even  within  given  game worlds, spatiality can support a change in the way players deal with the  given rules.  The  cinematic  and  visual  rules  on  the  mediated  plane  affect  the  player’s  comprehension of the game space; this will be outlined at greater length in  part II. Code alone is not sufﬁ cient to describe and deﬁ ne game spaces and  the experiences they provide.  2.2  Space and Game Structures  3D space implies the option of a different turn at any moment, a new choice,  or  a  different  perspective  that  outweighs  traditional  nodes  and  links.  The  freedom of spatial practice supports a bending or redeﬁ nition of given goals.  That is why Salen and Zimmerman use spatial metaphors to deﬁ ne “play” as   Chapter 2  28   “free movement within a more rigid structure”  2003, 304 . Players’ use of  game spaces often represents exactly such bending and breaking of rules.  A number of game designers have recognized this factor and have taken it  into account in their games—only to ﬁ nd out that players discover options  even  beyond  the  spatial  liberties  provided.  One  example  is  the  ﬁ rst-person  shooter Deus Ex  Spector 2000 , which offers players not only a range of cus- tomizations for their character but also game worlds with multiple routes and  spatial solutions. Yet innovative players discovered ways to expand even on  this “possibility space.” The game allows players to set up mines on walls as  traps  for  other  characters.  Instead  of  traps,  the  same  objects  can  be  used  as  stepping-stones  forming  improvised  ladders,  since  players  can  stand  on  the  small mine object and position mines along walls like ladders. The effect is  based on a rule-driven behavior: your own mines do not explode when you  are  close  to  them;  the  mines  consist  of  polygons  large  enough  to  provide  ample collision control to operate as ﬂ oor elements; ﬁ nally, collision detection  itself is a classic mathematical rule-based problem. At the same time, it results  in new spatial behavior: players can overcome level obstacles and reach areas  of the game space that were supposed to be off limit  Smith 2001 .  Some  game  designers  have  embraced  such  rule  bending  and  offer  what  might appear to be a bug as a conscious playable feature of the game space.  Players of Super Mario Bros.  Miyamoto 1985  can break through the expected  limitations  of  the  game  world,  jump  “outside”  the  frame  of  this  sideward- scrolling  jump-and-run  classic,  and  discover  additional  features   see  also  Gingold 2003 . As previously mentioned, a far more complex case are mas- sively multiplayer online titles. The clearly marked boundaries—here of the  game world—become negotiable within the game design. The surprises are  still implemented via a rule system, but one that seems to have multiple layers  at odds with each other. However, the game space remains the battered play- ground or envelope for the bent rules. Whatever structural model we want to  suggest, it has to work in these conditions. The game world should encompass  the  countless  options  that  grow  out  of  emergent  play  and  multiplayer  conditions.  Games and Rules  29    3  Deﬁ ning Interaction  Interactive access is a deﬁ ning feature of computer-based media—some argue  the most important one—whereby interactive digital media differ from tradi- tional media in allowing the interactor not only to perceive the virtual world  but also to manipulate it. Crawford, a game designer and theorist, explains  interaction as “a conversation: a cyclic process in which two actors alternately  listen, think, and speak”  2000, 5 , a dictum which can be rephrased as the  elements of input, process, and output.  The player in a video game is both reader  of the computer’s output  and  producer  via input  of events. For video game spaces, this means the player  not only enters the game worlds but also changes them and their ingredients.  These event-shaping features separate interactive access from the experience  of  traditional  media  and  pushes  interactive  game  worlds  beyond  Barthes’s  readerly and writerly texts. To describe the new dynamics of texts in interactive  digital  media,  Aarseth  develops  the  concept  of  a  “textual  machine.”  The  textual process in his model depends on the ﬂ uent collaboration of the operator   the human user , the medium  the computer , and the exchanged verbal sign,  to  generate  the   cyber   text   Aarseth  1997,  21 .  The  model  translates  the  technical elements—of input as it happens in the play space; output as pre- sented  in  the  mediated  space;  and  process  as  it  happens  in  the  rule-driven  space  of  the  computer,  but  also  in  the  ﬁ ctional  space  of  the  player—into  a  textual deﬁ nition, and offers an elegant description of the constant production  of interactive text in video games.  A key element of this production is the participation of the user in digital  media. Aarseth suggests the term “ergodic” to describe the difference between  this kind of interaction and other kinds of engagement. Participation depends    on the interactors’ physical activities—their movement in the physical world  that causes some input effect in the virtual world. Aarseth stresses that during  the interactive participation with the virtual world “the user will have effectu- ated a semiotic sequence, and this selective movement is a work of physical  construction that the various concepts of ‘reading’ do not account for’ ”  ibid.,  1 . Traditional media such as books, cinema, or radio do not offer this level  of  ergodic  participation,  and  Aarseth  clearly  separates  ergodic  participation  from any active reading. Examples of ergodic participation are a mouse click,  pressing a key, or moving a joystick—any physical input that can be registered  by  the  input  devices  and  has  an  effect  on  the  video  game  world—or  more  precisely: on the rule-based space. Such a deﬁ nition distinguishes video games  from  basic  forms  of  participatory  shows   such  as  TV  shows  with  audience  participation or radio shows, where listeners can request their favorite tunes ,  as the interactor is affecting the actual text, and the kind, force, and direction  of  muscular  activity  can  directly  change  the  events  at  hand.  Later,  Aarseth  extended his concept to argue that “ergodic phenomena are produced by some  kind  of  cybernetic  system,  i.e.,  a  machine   or  a  human   that  operates  as  an  information feedback loop, which will generate a different semiotic sequence  each time it is engaged”  1999, 32–33 . He allows for computers to talk to  computers within the textual machine without any human interactor being  involved and, consequently, has difﬁ culties in assessing the result, which he  rightly suspects would become a “nihilogue”  ibid., 40 . When two machines  talk  to  each  other  without  any  player  involvement,  the  process  of  semiotic  meaning building does not happen. There is no “semiotic sequence” for the  player. Because there is no meaning assigned by any involved player, no ﬁ c- tional space is generated. Inclusion of a human interactor avoids such a nihi- logue and will be at the heart of this argument.  To keep the communication model that is part of the interactive process  intact, ergodic input has to come from the human user s . Any chain of events  in  video  games  depends  on  the  player  as  an  integral  part  of  the  textual  machine. This relates to and exceeds Barthes’ arguments that the text can be  “experienced only in an activity of production”  1977, 157; italics in original  as  opposed to passively consumed work. Compared to a ﬁ xed work, such texts  can function like a network, standing in a relationship to each other where  “no vital ‘respect’ is due to the Text: it can be broken  .  .  .  it can be read without  the guarantee of its father  .  .  .  It is not that the Author may not ‘come back’  in the Text, in his text, but he then does so as a ‘guest’ ”  ibid., 161; italics  in original . In digital media, game designers—probably the most author-like  personae—often  ﬁ nd  themselves  facing  this  experience  when  returning  to  their ﬁ nished product as visitors in their own creation. In order to return at   Chapter 3  32   all, the game depends on an appropriate interface design that provides access  to the virtual stage.  Interfaces  are  the  gateways  between  player  and  game  system.  They  have  changed  since  the  knob  and  button  that  controlled  the  racket  in  Tennis  for  Two, but a history leading up to the current generation of motion-detecting  input devices is not the goal here. Some references to early interfaces will be  made,  but  the  argument  grows  from  two  points.  The  ﬁ rst  deals  with  the  element of abstraction and how it is applied, especially in interfaces for engag- ing  with  game  spaces.  The  second  is  that  spatiality  implies  a  simultaneous  interactive access on multiple layers. Based on these points, a brief summary  closes this chapter in order to point toward the element of narrative as it might  be implemented in the interface design.  Throughout, the focus remains on spatiality in video games and does not  cover other elements of interface design in video games that might deal with  other representational forms.  3.1  Interface Abstraction  We can distinguish between two interactions with virtual space to simplify  the discussion: movement through space and specialized manipulation of ele- ments  within  that  space.  Movement  through  space  is  a  ubiquitous  form  of  interaction  in  navigable  virtual  worlds  but  it  remains  an  abstraction  that  differs signiﬁ cantly from movement in the real world. Specialized interactions  can include access to objects within the world  e.g., picking up virtual objects  in Shenmue  II  [Suzuki  2001] ,  access  to  the  space  itself   e.g.,  changing  the  virtual environment in SimCity , or interaction with other users  e.g., chatting  in Counter-Strike , among others. On the level of these specialized interactions,  most  games  use  a  “direct  manipulation”  approach.  Players  seem  to  directly  affect objects in the virtual world. One click and Lara Croft operates the lever  to open a door in Tomb Raider or Gordon Freeman swaps ammunition clips  to reload his guns in Half-Life. This is an abstraction of the oldest form of  human-computer  interaction  that  saw  programmers  operating  machines  by  physically adjusting knobs and dials.  Originally,  knobs-and-dials  interfaces  were  found,  for  example,  in  the  analog  machines  build  by  Turing  for  the  decoding  of  the  Enigma  code,  1939–1940.  Coders  interacted  with  the  computer  directly  by  affecting  the  hardware;  knobs  and  dials  allowed  direct  physical  control  over  the  logical  processes.  In  graphical  user  interfaces,  Walker  observed  a  reference  back  to  abstracted forms of this principle: “We’ve taken the computer user, who was  initially in direct control of a dedicated computer, operating it by switches   Deﬁ ning Interaction  33   and gazing at huge arrays of blinking lights, to greater and greater distances  from the computer and direct interaction with it, then back again to contem- plating a virtual control panel on a glowing screen ﬁ lled with slide pots, radio  buttons, meters, all providing direct and expressive control over what’s going  on inside the computer”  1994, 444 .  The  original  knobs-and-dials  principle  worked  with  little  or  no  level  of  abstraction, because no mediated space stood between the computer and its  user. Later, the graphical user interface of the computer desktop introduced  virtual “folders” and “recycle bins” that relate back to this low-level abstrac- tion  via  the  visual  metaphor.  Once  the  2D  plane  extended  into  3D  space,  these options needed to be situated in the newly forming game spaces. The  same metaphors also exist in game worlds in the form of basic physical devices  or images such as virtual levers, buttons, ammunition clips, or guns. Just as  the desktop metaphor helped users to gain access to functions, so do these 3D  objects provide access and heighten the level of immediacy within the virtual  environment. Players seem to interact with an elevator call button within the  game space of Counter-Strike—they do not type in a command line that would  relocate them automatically or use a special key on the computer specialized  for the elevator function. Like the user-avatar, these knobs and dials are part  of one coherent spatial system and can be arranged within the virtual space  in complex combinations.  Combining interface elements this way answers Laurel’s call for interfaces  and  applications  to  be  “couched  in  the  same  context—namely,  the  context  of  the  objects, actions, and tools of the representational world”  1993, 127; italics in origi- nal . The game world becomes more compact as numerous interface objects  are arranged into a coherent and accessible game space. The better this world  operates, the less the players have to understand the code logic underneath,  which was so crucial for the knobs-and-dials system. A game world does not  ask interactors to understand the internal computer processes and the mathe- matical logic of the code. Players do not have to translate the metaphors and  the 3D game spaces back into their technical generation, but instead are asked  to connect them to a consistent ﬁ ctional world.  The metaphor for a virtual gun is one way to exemplify this connection.  Most virtual guns offer the option of ﬁ ring them. Firing itself is usually trig- gered through a pressing or release of a button on the game controller. The  signal calls a script to perform a certain change in the virtual game world,  namely virtually ﬁ ring the polygon gun. The virtual shot can have an immedi- ate impact in the rule-based and mediated planes: a sound might be triggered,  graphics  for  a  virtual  bullet  impact  might  appear,  computer-controlled   Chapter 3  34   entities might react, the virtual gun might recoil and change the viewpoint,  and a force-feedback system might simulate some physical reaction back into  the game controller and back into the play space. These and other effects are  artiﬁ cially  assembled  elements  of  the  gun-interface  metaphor.  They  do  not  demand any consideration of the underlying code by the interactor and appear  natural.  But  however  natural  the  interface  appears,  ﬁ ring  a  virtual  gun  is  a  complex  interface  task  with  a  high  level  of  abstraction  during  which  the  virtual object  the gun  and its effects are positioned in the virtual space and  interact with it. Such a contextualization uses virtual representations of physi- cal interfaces to simulate a coherent game universe. The gun is situated in the  virtual world; the player has access to that gun; therefore the interaction con- nects the player better to the game space. The gun is experienced as a tool to  perform on the virtual, like the knobs and dials were used before. But unlike  the programmer of the 1940s, the twenty-ﬁ rst-century game player remains  oblivious of the true operation of this access. The metaphor of the virtual gun  is part of the ﬁ ctional spatial world and provides a form of consistency within  this world.  Once  this  consistency  is  guaranteed,  these  interface  elements  can  create  new effects that obviously break the real-world metaphor—like “movement”  or  “shooting”—but  stay  true  to  the  virtual  object.  For  example,  the  ﬁ rst- person shooting game series Quake  Carmack 1996  allows the use of a “rocket  launcher” recoil introduced in Marathon     J. Jones 1994  to enhance the jump  height of the user-avatar, exploiting it like a rocket-blast effect. Consistent  with the gun interface-metaphor, the feature of a virtual high jump has been  translated into an in-world effect not advisable in the physical world. Although  the  abstraction  loosely  refers  to  real-world  effects,  it  ultimately  supports  a  ﬁ ctional  world  setting  and  combines  the  basic  movement  through  virtual  space with a specialized object interaction. These forms of combined, different  interactions  are  typical  for  successful  video  games  that  allow  for  multiple  levels of interactive access to the game space.  3.2  Structuring Multilayered Access  Any game world providing the rudimentary interactive features of navigation  and specialized interaction with objects in the virtual space faces the challenge  of dealing with at least two interactive features at the same time. The presen- tation  section  will  later  add  another  option:  control  of  the  virtual  camera.  Insofar  as  3D  virtual  space  calls  for  multiple  simultaneous  interactions,  engagement with video game spaces is less of an “either or” logic and more   Deﬁ ning Interaction  35   of an “and” approach. This steps beyond a ping-pong interaction model where  the ball of interactive access is either in the player’s or the system’s court. A  pure sequential form of abstracted interactive access is possible, for example,  in  titles  such  as  Pong  Bushnell  1972 ,  which  allow  only  extremely  limited  interactive access. However, this is rarely the case in real-time 3D game spaces,  posing a special demand to video-game-space interface design.  Counter-Strike  Le and Cliffe 1999  stages multiple interactors in two oppos- ing  teams  ﬁ ghting  their  way  through  various  virtual  environments.  In  the  middle of a ﬁ ght, I can turn around to face an approaching enemy. This not  only initiates a new spatial orientation, but also allows me while turning to  shoot, throw grenades, change or reload the weapon of my avatar, activate a  special item  e.g., a sniper view , duck crouch jump to avoid impact, call for  help to friendly forces  controlled by other players , or taunt the enemy. In  Counter-Strike, all these functions—examples of direct interactive access with  immediate  audiovisual  feedback—are  accessible  at  the  same  time  through  keyboard, mouse, and optional voice input. Most of these interactions depend  on the avatar’s position in space. It makes a lot of difference for my actions  whether  I  stand  next  to  a  door  that  can  open  or  close,  a  virtual  elevator,  a  pitfall that might stop the enemy, or behind some cover from possible attacks.  The most important variables are the positions and maneuvers of other players  around me in the game world. The Counter-Strike example illustrates some of  the complexities of interface design for 3D video games spaces: because inter- actions  can  happen  on  various  levels  and  with  various  other  entities  at  the  same time, interactive access exists in parallel. Players have to do more than  one thing at any given moment; more than one kind of input might be neces- sary to succeed in the game.  Both multilayered access and spatial conditioning are attempts to mimic  experienced real-world behavior through the abstractions of the game interface  that enhance spatiality. They make interacting with 3D virtual spaces richer  but  also  more  challenging.  Multilayered  access  and  spatial  referencing  can  demand so much attention that non-game-related information might be over- powered  by  the  complexities  of  the  virtual  game  world.  The  player  has  to  perform  not  one  but  many  tasks  in  the  game  space,  which  leaves  even  less  opportunity to recognize the underlying mathematical logic. Players have to  deal with and combine the foregrounded representations of the interfaces, the  virtual guns, doors, environments, and avatars; they often lack the occasion  to study them independently in more detail. Only once a level of mastery is  accomplished  they  might  start  grokking  the  game.  Space  is  a  supporting  factor to bind the player into the game universe and to situate actions, objects,  and other players.  Chapter 3  36   3.3  Game-Space Interfaces in Narrative Context  The  set  of  rules  that  deﬁ ne  the  interactions  cannot  be  “just  like  real  life”   Laurel 1986, 100  but has to be distinctively selective. Limited as it might  be, it offers powerful structural capabilities to the designer. “No playwright,  no  stage  director,  no  emperor,  however  powerful,  has  ever  exercised  such  absolute authority to arrange a stage or ﬁ eld of battle and to command such  unswervingly dutiful actors or troops”  Weizenbaum in Walker 1994, 230 .  The  “command”  is  always  structured  and  it  is  the  task  of  the  designer  to  optimize the structure and to make access to the game space engaging and  effective. A quarter-century ago, Malone already recognized that “fantasies can  be very important in creating intrinsically motivating environments but that,  unless the fantasies are carefully chosen to appeal to the target audience, they  may actually make the environment less interesting rather than more”  1982,  64 . Situating the player without careful consideration and not realizing and  applying the methods correctly can be counterproductive.  The units at the basis of this structuring, the foundational building blocks,  are the evocative narrative elements. Such elements can be anything and any  situation encountered in a game world that is structured to support and pos- sibly  guide  the  player’s  comprehension.  The  elements’  task  is  to  improve  a  player’s experience and understanding of the game world. Players encounter  and read these elements, comprehend the information in the context of a ﬁ c- tional  world,  and  learn  from  them  as  they  build  contextual  connections  between  elements.  Much  the  same  can  be  said  about  other  interfaces,  but  unlike  a  help  function  or  the  task  bar  in  a  word  processing  program,  the  interface in video games is dramatic. This demands a reorientation of deﬁ ning  qualities given that implementing a dramatic interface might not necessarily  lead  to  enhanced  usability  in  the  traditional  sense.  Federoff,  for  example,  highlights  a  dominance  of  the  satisfaction  factor  in  games  versus  efﬁ ciency  and effectiveness  2002, 5 . Here we concentrate on one section of the inter- face: the depicted virtual space and the player’s interaction with it.  The abstraction of the interface into a video game space can be traced back  to  classic  human-computer  interface  work.  Shneiderman  outlined  three  key  criteria as quality standards for graphical direct manipulation:  1.  continuous representation of the object of interest; 2.  physical actions or labeled button presses instead of complex syntax; and 3.  rapid  incremental  reversible  operations  whose  impact  on  the  object  of  interest  is  immediately  visible.   Shneiderman  in  Laurel  1993,  8;  also  Shneiderman 1998, 229   Deﬁ ning Interaction  37   Shneiderman himself distinguishes between interface design for entertain- ment-driven  titles  and  task-driven  applications  where  “users  focus  on  their  task  and  may  resent  too  many  playful  distractions”   1998,  197 .  Forms  of  interaction vary widely in game spaces and can establish their own goals that  might oppose any immediate usability. Efﬁ ciency and satisfaction are impor- tant in games as well as in any other digital application, but they are applied  differently. Because the list of possible interactions is endless, only a very basic  distinction will be made between the spatial exploration of the game world  and more specialized interaction with entities inside the game space. With  this caveat in place, we can look into the necessary adjustments. Shneiderman’s  three criteria for interface design have to be reassessed in reference to the new  directive to engage the player, and in the light of video game spaces.  Continuous representation  Most large-scale virtual spaces can be perceived only  partially at any single moment. A complete representation of the whole space  is not possible or necessary. Complete spatial representation in fact reduces  the dramatic effect of spatial exploration because it removes elements of sur- prise and suspense that can be triggered by a gradual revealing of the game  space. Dramatic moments and references such as suspense and surprise depend  on the nonvisibility of certain elements within the game space. This mirrors  the effect of building up suspense and anticipation in ﬁ lms through camera  work that provides only partial revelations  e.g., Blowup directed by Antonioni  [1966] . In a comparable way, a game world can exploit its intrinsic quality  of  gradually  revealed  space  to  stimulate  curiosity.  This  proposes  a  dramatic representation  that  does  not  have  to  be  continuous,  but  concise  and  focused.  Part II of this book will investigate such a presentation in greater detail. Physical  actions no  complex  syntax  Navigation  in  space  might  be  a  natural,  everyday interaction for human beings, but that does not make it less complex.  In addition, multilayered access often adds more depth to navigation, raising  the  level  of  complexity  further.  The  player  receives  assistance  through  the  level  of  abstraction  in  game  worlds  as  interfaces  often  refer  to  physical  actions—following Shneiderman’s criteria. Nevertheless, while games might  favor direct interaction with relatively simple single units, complexity between  these units and interactions is an important factor in their interface design. Although their basic syntax might seem simple, the range of speciﬁ c condi- tions that can be generated through spatial conditioning of objects accumu- lates in a dynamic game space and leads to very complex situations. That is  why many games start with an introduction of the interface to the player that  explains the basic features step by step. Subsequent levels often increase the  complexity and demand mastery of new and more difﬁ cult spatial conditions.   Chapter 3  38   Mastering  space  is  also  a  mastering  of  the  elements  within  it.  The  Metroid series perfected the gradual improvement of the main characters’ abilities that,  in return, allow for more spatial exploration. This comprehensible multilayered  interactive  access  enhances  the  complexity  and  depth  of  the  game  world  as  well its dramatic structure. It is engaging because the interconnections are so  complex; the conditions of locked doors and necessary upgrades to the char- acter in Metroid games are demanding but also motivating for players. Com- prehensible  multilayered  access  provides  players  with  different  interactive  options  at  any  given  moment  that  can  add  to  the  way  they  encounter  and  engage with the virtual world. Rapid actions  Examples of rapid actions in game spaces are forms of direct  access to objects and entities within them. For example, picking up an object  in virtual space calls for a clear impact of the action on the speciﬁ c object;  shooting at an avatar nearby calls for some reaction in this character; steering  the  player-avatar  calls  for  a  direct  translation  of  the  input  to  the  avatar’s  behavior.  However,  these  forms  of  rapid  actions  in  a  game  world  can  be  restricted in order to implement dramatic key moments. An extreme example  of narrative-deﬁ ned interface limitations can be found in Galyean’s Dogmatic installation at MIT, which uses a head-mounted display that offers free view  control  to  the  user.  While  the  visual  control  is  free,  the  progression  of  the  predeﬁ ned story is not. At one point in the event, once the user-avatar is hit  by a virtual car “the system cuts to black and control is taken from the user.  As it fades back in, the user is given back limited control. They are now only  allowed to look within a limited space to the left, right, up, and down.  .  .  .  It  is motivated by the story content”  Galyean 1995, 129 . This authorial inter- vention mirrors the effect of an injury caused by the car accident through the  interface. This point-of-view restriction is neither reversible nor incremental.  In fact, the limitation of interactive access itself provides meaning for the ﬁ c- tional world. Many ﬁ rst-person shooter games from Half-Life to Deus Ex to  Breakdown  Noguchi 2004  include this form of interface restriction.  At one point, the hero under my control in Metal Gear Solid  Kojima 1997 ,  Solid Snake, faces an obviously disturbed and somewhat disturbing character  named Psychomantis. This enemy claims to have special psychic powers and  ﬁ ghting him is a highlight in the game experience. During this ﬁ ght sequence,  I  am  presented  with  a  cutscene  in  which  Psychomantis  directly  addresses  me—the  player—mocking  me  about  my  saving  habits  as  he  checks  the  memory card of the PlayStation. It seems he not only ﬁ ghts my virtual hero,  Solid Snake, but also the player in the play space. To win this ﬁ ght, Psycho- mantis claims that he can move the controller in my hands using his psycho  powers. When the cutscene ends and gameplay resumes, I realize that indeed   Deﬁ ning Interaction  39   something is terribly wrong with the controls. The ﬁ ght cannot be won using  the usual in-game mechanics and interface set up that was used during the  game so far. Instead I have to unplug the physical game controller from the  default slot and plug into the second input slot in the PlayStation console.  Only then control is regained and this speciﬁ c opponent can be overcome. It  is an extreme example of a narrative-evocative moment that manifests through  an interface restriction. The restriction in this particular case even manages  to reach into the physical play space as it requires a rewiring of the physical  controller.  Precisely through its restriction of rapid access, this example improves the  game’s  spatiality.  It  interconnects  the  different  active  planes:  rule-based,  mediated, play space, and ﬁ ctional. The careful timing and rhythm of interactive  access allows for narrative and dramatic shaping of the experience.  Game interfaces for 3D titles are shaped in reference to their spatial context.  This factor can be used as a strong structuring device. Dramatic representation, comprehensible multilayered access, and timing rhythm are steps in the direction of  an engaging video-game-interface design based on the game’s spatiality. An  interface design following these criteria might not be advisable as the desktop  of an operating system or for bank cash machines. We would not appreciate  an  obviously  disturbed  psychotic  talking  to  us  from  the  screen  of  an  ATM  machine and changing our pin code. But we do like that form of interaction  in game worlds, especially when it supports their spatiality and our position  in it. At the same time, Shneiderman’s original criteria remain useful—indeed  sometimes  essential—for  game  spaces.  That  is  why  they  were  not  replaced  but widened. This widened spectrum already points to important components  for effective virtual game spaces: fragmented space through complex presenta- tion, variable interactive access through specialized and ﬂ exible interfaces, and  interaction  on  multiple  layers.  Many  of  these  components  will  reappear  in  more speciﬁ c discussions on game space presentation and functionality.  Chapter 3  40   4  Deﬁ ning Narrative  The value of narrative and its use for analysis and critique of interactive digital  media have been the point of much debate. The role of narrative in digital  media is widely discussed, and the connection between the two is often attrib- uted to Murray  1997 , who envisioned new representations of stories to be  told by the evolving interactive media. Her inﬂ uential work was soon attacked  by researchers focusing more exclusively on the ludic elements of video games.  Concentrating further on the ﬁ eld of traditional game theory and aspects of  computer  games,  some  of  these  researchers  argue  that  nonlinear  interactive  and narrative structures are mutually exclusive. Juul goes so far as to say that  “the  computer  game  is  simply  not  a  narrative  medium”   1999,  1 .  Others  argue  that  basic  formal  narrative  theories  such  as  Aristotle’s  act  structures,  which have been applied to new media by researchers such as Laurel  1986 ,  oppose  users’  interactive  control   Eskelinen  2001a .  Restricting  the  user’s  freedom in order to implement a predeﬁ ned narrative structure is seen as an  unnatural and patronizing counterforce from traditional media theory limit- ing the interactive features and speciﬁ cs for video games. Thus, it has been  argued  that  research  in  video  games  should  concentrate  on  the  dominating  element of interaction.  Few  narratologists  position  themselves  as  opposed  to  the  ludic  but  rather  more complementary to it, which renders the concept of narratologist difﬁ cult  to  deﬁ ne.  Today,  the  debate  sees  a  number  of  different  approaches  toward  video games of which narrative and ludic are only two. Elements like “play”  or “narrative” remain as attributes of the new media, but are assembled in a  growing network of interconnected qualities that touch on social networks,  gender, politics, ethics, communication, economy, and more. Ultimately, the    question is not whether video games are either one or the other, ludic or nar- rative.  Thankfully,  both  concepts  have  been  taken  onboard  the  research  as  varying  perspectives  with  speciﬁ c  strengths  and  weaknesses   e.g.,  Juul  2005 .  That does not mean that one can take a term like “narrative” as granted.  There is valid critique, especially on the use of the terminology  see also Frasca  2003; Mallon and Webb 2005 . For our discussion of video game spaces, nar- rative  is  best  understood  as  a  form  of  comprehension  that  can  be  triggered  and affected by the game world. This book considers this comprehension as  necessary in order to make sense of the game space.  4.1  Narrative, Comprehension, Meaning, and Space  We are fairly familiar with our physical home environment: the television set,  the favorite chair one sits on when playing games, the game controller, one’s  physical needs such as the ordered pizza, the preferred beverage, the level of  lighting and sound to optimize the game experience. In comparison, we are  initially  far  less  at  home  in  the  world  of  polygons,  textures,  and  interfaces  presented to us on the screen. Yet, the game asks us to master its levels, plan  our actions in them, and execute them with a great level of skill. Players have  to learn to read, use, and predict this world almost as if it were their home  or private backyard.  Acclaimed  game  designer  Sid  Meier  described  a  good  game  as  “a  series  of  interesting  choices”   see  Rollings  and  Morris  2004,  200 .  To  keep  this  interest  alive,  video  games  can  interconnect  the  choices  and  weave  a  net  of  relations among them, thereby creating a context for each single interaction.  Raph Koster, another successful game designer, realized that a player has to  learn this context to engage in the game world. For him, this aspect of learn- ing is the single most important element in gaming because he sees it at the  heart of player engagement and fun. Games, for Koster, are basically learning  tools   2005,  36 .  At  the  same  time,  critics  and  scholars  have  developed  the idea of games that teach on more than this basic level  e.g., Gee 2004;  Johnson 2005 .  I concur with the concept of player engagement via a learning process. But  in comparison to simple pattern recognition, the more complex recognition  and engagement theories promise more value for game spaces. In this case,  the single unit to be recognized is the individual evocative narrative element.  These evocative narrative elements support the necessary understanding of the  game world and the player’s positioning in it. Not unlike Gee  2004 , this  points toward the situatedness of the player. A gamer has to ﬁ rst understand   Chapter 4  42   a situation and his or her position in it before any action can be planned and  executed in relation to it. It is here that narrative enters the picture. Following  Bruner, narrative  is  understood  as  a  dominating  discourse  form  in  human  communication in general  1990, 77 . Bruner’s concept of the ingredients of  narrative  is  rather  applied  and  basic:  stories  consist  of  characters  and  their  expectations  of  and  behavior  in  the  story  world.  This  world  is  often  inter- rupted by a breach that the characters have to deal with. These stories need  to be narrated to come to life. Dealing with these factors has become such an  everyday task, he argues, that “we are so adept at narrative that it seems almost  as natural as language itself”  Bruner 2002, 3 . This idea of narrative as com- prehension that helps to make sense of actions will be adapted here. Narrative  structures are woven into our comprehension of almost any situation—game  or not. This kind of narrative is not a ﬁ xed solution or an end state of any  event, “it is deeply about the plight, about the road rather than about the inn  to which it leads”  ibid., 20 . This road exists in the mind of the player and  is constantly fueled by stimulants from the game. Stimulated by the game,  the  player  weaves  the  connections,  creates  a  narrative  context.  This  mirrors  the concept of ideation formulated by reception theorists like Wolfgang Iser.  Iser  approaches  the  “text  as  event”   1978   that  sees  readers  ﬁ lling  in  gaps  through their imagination and creativity. The structure of a video game might  foreshadow  this  ideation  through  the  design  of  the  evocative  narrative  ele- ments, but it comes to life only through the work of the player. The resulting  story, Bruner’s “road,” exists only in the mind’s eye.  For game spaces, this assembled image is a necessary part of meaningful  interaction. It complements the ludic elements of a 3D game. A fundamental  function of narrative, as it is understood here, is that of providing “a way of  comprehending space, time, and causality”  Branigan 1992, 36 . As the inter- face discussion showed, conditions can become more complex and multilay- ered when players engage in 3D game spaces. Narrative elements can create  a supportive context for the necessary interpretation and prevent a chaotic and  meaningless  explosion  of  possibilities.  The  problem  is  that  such  an  under- standing of narrative is almost all-inclusive and thereby close to useless. The  way it can be applied to video games needs some clariﬁ cation.  New media scholars have pushed the active role of the player reader before   e.g., Aarseth 1997; Ryan 2001a, b; Kücklich 2001  but did so primarily in  the context of MUDs and hypertextual pieces. The element of 3D navigable  space adds a different mechanism to the readers’ involvement. While we can  consider game worlds as a format of video games just like MUDs, players read  and interact with them in very different ways than they do with descriptive  text. Game worlds situate the players in a different relation to the evocative   Deﬁ ning Narrative  43   elements. As we engage in the game space we start that discourse for which  Bruner has identiﬁ ed narrative as a main method.  Narrative is a way for the player to make sense of the in-game situation.  The main process happens in the player, but it can be evoked and directed by  evocative narrative elements, formed by encounters or situations in the game  that prime some form of comprehension. Evocative elements are included in  virtual environments to improve the meaning-building process of the player.  The elements are not “stories” but suggestive markings. They are clustered  in certain ways and aimed to trigger reactions in players in order to help them  to create their own interpretations. One consequence of such a model is that  the stories are never in the piece itself but in the mind of the player.  4.2  More than One Story  Evocative  narrative  elements  encourage  players  to  project  meaning  onto  events, objects, and spaces in game worlds. They help to infuse signiﬁ cance.  Their value is not realized on the level of the element itself but in the way  players read and connect them. Creating these connections, players can form  narratives that refer to the game world. If this meaning assignment becomes  very strong, the virtual items themselves can leave the rule-based space, ﬁ c- tional space, social space, and even the play space.   If  a  player  plays  alongside  a  computer-controlled  character  for  a  long  time—as in Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom  Hartigan et al. 1996 — only to discover that this character is a traitor to what seemed to be the shared  cause, the situation can evoke the sense of betrayal and loss. When a long- standing virtual friend “dies” such as Floyd the robot in Planetfall  Meretzky  1983  and Tassadar in StarCraft  Phinney and Metzen 1998 , and the much  talked-about  death  of  Aeris  in  Final  Fantasy  VII   Kitase  and  Narita  1997 ,  players can report the sense of loss as tangible. But assignments do not have  to be as one-directional. One and the same element can be arranged into dif- ferent constructs encouraging different responses.  At the end of Deus Ex, I am presented with three choices leading to three  different endings, each following a speciﬁ c philosophy with its ethical quali- ties and ﬂ aws. This selection might seem minimal but I make the decision  based on a multihour-playing experience during which I have customized my  virtual hero as well as developed his alignments with the various factions at  work. Answering the questions in the end is only the conclusion of an ongoing  debate  that  consistently  crossed  my  path  as  I  played  the  game.  Value  is  attached through a context and history that grows from a network of actions  I share with the game world through the main character. Some games try to   Chapter 4  44   establish  such  a  network  very  early  on.  The  ﬁ rst  minutes  of  Max  Payne     Järvilehto and Stein 2001  stage me as the virtual action hero Max Payne,  who comes home to discover that he  and I  cannot stop a group of computer- controlled virtual thugs from killing Payne’s young family in the ﬁ rst game  level. The shock is a strong incentive to continue the game Max Payne and a  powerful evocative event.  The aim of narrative elements like these is not to tell a linear story, but to  provide  evocative  means  for  the  interactor  to  comprehend  the  virtual  space  and  the  events  within  it,  and  generate  context  and  signiﬁ cance  in  order  to  make the space and the experience of it more meaningful. While the reader  of  a  novel  is  limited  to  the  given  text,  the  player  of  a  game  interacts  with  these evocative elements, cocreates them, and changes them. Whatever mani- fests itself in the shape of this comprehension is of a unique nature. A game’s  “story” is not a singular entity. This development is covered further in the  research on hypertext and its predecessors  e.g., Montfort 2003 . The differ- ence in video game spaces is the spatial mechanics of the narrative elements  and the interactive access to them.  Uncovering the space, its drama, and meaning goes hand in hand with the  gradual comprehension of events and objects into narrative context. This leads  to the close interconnection of space and narrative. Narrative elements help  to make the space meaningful and space helps to situate these elements. The  most important element that needs positioning is the player. This effect has  parallels in literary studies and narratology in discussions of voice and perspec- tive. How do these and other traditional key elements of narratology apply to  game worlds? Starting from the concept of the ﬁ nal assembly of narrative in  the user’s mind, a set of tools can be adapted from narratology for the descrip- tion of the process of how the evocative elements interact with the user, how  they are read, and where user interaction and predeﬁ ned elements overlap.  Deﬁ ning Narrative  45    5  Combining Interaction and Narrative  Some years ago, I worked on a project at Sony’s game development studios in  Cambridge  with  a  friend  from  a  renowned  British  ﬁ lm  school.  He  had  not  been  playing  games  for  years.  But  the  studio  offered  an  enormous  library  of PlayStation games, constantly updated and available to employees free of  charge. The temptation was overwhelming and, after a few days, he had pur- chased his own PlayStation and spent a considerable amount of time playing  at  home,  during  lunch  breaks,  and  whenever  there  was  an  opportunity.  Gaming fever had struck, and within a week all the symptoms of a dedicated  gamer  were  apparent.  His  favorite  was  Silent  Hill   Kitao  and  Gallo  1999 .  Silent Hill stages its survival horror gameplay in a distinctive narrative setting.  Sequels have reﬁ ned the original formula with varying degrees of success. But  instead of analyzing primarily the structuralist elements of this game  e.g.,  character or setting , I was more intrigued by my friend’s growing relationship  with the game world. Like many other games, Silent Hill takes the player into  ever-deeper pits of horror. My friend continuously got lost in the lower regions  of the game space that seem to be designed in such a way as to turn the space  into a state of an ongoing nightmare. In fact, the last section of the game is  staged in a “Nowhere” world, where spatial orientation in endless repeating  rows  of  blood-stained  hallways  becomes  a  maze  with  seemingly  no  exit.  In  such  a  disorienting  “otherworld,”  any  assisting  ﬁ xation  through  evocative  narrative elements is only too welcome. Helpful non-player characters provide  some of these ﬁ xations. At one point of the game, my friend steered his game  hero into yet another ghastly blood-smeared cellar. But in this particular room  and at this moment in the game, he had to witness how one of the formerly  friendly game-controlled characters turned into a zombie creature herself. The    transformation  itself  was  presented  as  a  linear,  noninteractive  cutscene  ending  with  the  player-avatar  ﬂ eeing  the  scene  and  standing  once  again  outside the room. Left outside, control was given back to the player. There  was an expression of horror not  only in the  hero’s eyes but also in  those of  my  friend.  He  looked  at  me,  shocked,  and  confessed  that  he  really  would  rather not kill this particular person—even if she were a deadly zombie now.  What to do? In fact, there is no choice and this character cannot be “saved.”  The choice was without consequence because there simply was no alternate  game state. However, my friend’s connection to the character went far beyond  a replaceable game token—it grew out of the cognitive work invested into  the game.  This  demonstrates  how  game  events  can  be  interpreted  into  a  personal  meaningful layer. The event located in the game world had become so signiﬁ - cant that it triggered a response that moved beyond the play space and became  quite literally a turning point for the player, one so strong that he turned to  a non-player, in this case me, to discuss the matter at hand. This event created  a social space for the game even after the game shut down, showing the power  of evocative narrative elements and the dilemmas they can create for us when  they are encountered effectively in a video game world’s spatiotemporal uni- verse. The evocative narrative elements can connect different spheres like the  play, social, and rule-based ones and start to weave a network among them.  A number of established and debated principles will be revisited to investigate  this network, with 3D navigable space providing a new perspective.  5.1  Story and Plot  In discussing narrative, Russian formalists distinguished between fabula and  sjužet—the  events  as  they  happen  one  by  one   fabula   versus  the  order  and  manner of their presentation  sjužet . Many researchers have adopted this basic  designation, some equate fabula with story and sjužet with plot, among them  Jefferson  1986, 39  with focus on literary overview, Chatman  1990, 9  on  ﬁ lm,  and  Aarseth   1997,  112   on  cybertext.  Others  interpret  fabula  as  plot  rather than story  Bruner 1990, 43 ; or read sjužet as story and fabula as events   Brooks referring to Ricoeur in Brooks 1984, 14 , which means that the range  of interpretations of the original terms has become so great as to be potentially  confusing in the present context.  Reconciling the usages of the terminology in any ﬁ nal way is outside the  scope  of  this  work.  In  the  context  of  game  spaces,  the  distinction  between  fabula  and  sjužet—as  proposed  by  the  Russian  formalists  before  passing  through  the  mill  of  structuralism,  poststructuralism,  deconstruction,  and   Chapter 5  48   semiotics—seems appropriate. In the analysis that follows, fabula is used to  designate the events and their order, while sjužet refers to the order and manner  of  their  presentation.  The  terms  of  story  and  plot  are  not  directly  equated  with either.  Consequently,  the  fabula  of  video  games  consists  of  the  actual  events  as  they  are  cocreated  by  interactors  during  the  textual  generation  process.  In other words, the fabula in video games consists of the events as they happen during  run-time,  not  as  they  should  happen  as  provided  by  the  work.  The  fabula of the video game Myst  Miller and Miller 1993 , for example, is not  the underlying background story of a conﬂ ict between two brothers and their  father,  but  the  player’s  uncovering  of  it.  Any  development  of  the  fabula  is  positioned  within  the  responsibility  of  the  user’s  interaction  that  is  itself  informed  by  the  evocative  narrative  elements  of  the  title.  A  fabula  is  only  processed when the player engages.  The sjužet is present in 3D video games through the work of the presenta- tion.  For  current  3D  spaces,  the  presentation  of  events  in  the  game  space  mainly  happens  through  audiovisual  as  well  as  limited  tactile  output.  The  sjužet of Max Payne can structure, for example, ﬂ ashbacks, replays, or dream  interludes.  As real-time environments represent the events as they happen in run-time,  fabula and sjužet are closely intertwined. Events are created on the level of the  fabula and, at the same time, they are presented and interpreted in the sjužet and told back to the player. Sjužet and fabula are tied together on the level of  interaction  and  immediate  audiovisual  presentation.  In  this  combination,  sjužet  has  the  option  to  position  events  in  the  ﬁ ctional  game  universe  and  fabula has the power to realize the event as such. This interpretation of inter- connected, yet separate levels of sjužet and fabula allows the investigation into  the narrative layers of video game spaces. It demands a closer investigation of  camera  work,  for  example,  as  the  virtual  camera  provides  the  main  ﬁ lter  through which the sjužet is presented to the player.  The concept of plot is useful in the context of video games for a description  of the comprehension of the fabula by the interactor. Barthes clearly makes  the distinction: “To interpret a text is not to give it a  more or less justiﬁ ed,  more  or  less  free   meaning,  but  on  the  contrary  to  appreciate  what  plural constitutes it”  1974, 5; italics in original . In video games, this “plural” has  to be concretized, at least to some extent, as the interactor is asked to draw  conclusions and further interact based on these conclusions. Players have to  interact in some way with the ﬁ ctional world, which excludes a passive dwell- ing in a polysemic text. Continuous passivity lacks the necessary ergodic input  and usually leads to the end of the game as interactive text. A video game   Combining Interaction and Narrative  49   that demands meaningful action in a 3D world from its players also demands  a plot creation from them.  In contrast to the reader, who follows the events in a book, the player in  a video game is obliged to act in order to keep the textual machine working.  Agency is not only an option but also a demand. It can even turn into a curse,  for  example,  in  any  moral  dilemma  that  a  video  game  might  pose  to  the  interactor and that demands a dubious decision. This was the dilemma my  Silent  Hill-playing  colleague  encountered.  The  necessity  to  act  can  enforce  meaning assessment and situates the plot into this assessment.  Fortunately, some literary scholars have already developed the concept of  plot  for  traditional  media.  Brooks  situates  the  plot  in  between  sjužet  and  fabula: “Plot could be thought of as the interpretive activity elicited by the  distinction between sjužet and fabula, the way we use the one against the other”   1984,  13 .  Likewise,  Iser  emphasizes  the  “convergence  of  text  and  reader”  where the reader interacts with the plot and the text merely provides the rules  for this interaction  1976, 176 . Plot is happening on the side of the player— in the ﬁ ctional space. Plot is neither the factual order of events nor their pre- sentation, but the order and connections between events as understood by the  reader. Plot is the result of a cognitive process.  This relocation of the plot answers some dilemmas posted by researchers  of interactive media. Locating the plot within the game world, Laurel claims  that  it  would  be  too  much  to  expect  any  interactor  to  have  to  fulﬁ ll  his  embodiment in the ﬁ ctional world and to create a unique plot at the same  time.  “He  [=  the  user]  cannot  lose  himself  in  the  experience  of  creating  a  character  because  he  must  keep  an  eye  on  the  development  of  the  plot;  he  cannot enjoy the act of playwriting because he is constantly distracted by the  requirements of acting”  1986, 29 . Referring to Aristotle, she equates play- writing   work  creation   with  the  plot  creation  in  an  attempt  to  situate  all  narrative  elements  within  the  work  itself.  The  result  is  a  dilemma  of  “plot  versus  interactivity”—one  that  shines  through  a  number  of  arguments  in  game studies.  Indeed, there are games that are less plot-driven than others. Tetris  Pajit- nov, Pavlovsky, and Gerasimov 1985  offers few means for plot generation. The  world in Tetris is dominated by the rule-driven plane. Its mediated space is  reduced to a 2D representation; the ﬁ ctional space is forced to deal with rather  abstract geometrical tasks and, if successful, mirrors the rule-based plane. This  is by no means a critique of Tetris’s game qualities but of its spatial ones. In  fact, experiments question the value of Tetris as a training tool for spatial rota- tion   Sims  and  Mayer  2002 .  The  original  Tetris  is  a  game  with  an  almost  exclusive focus on the rule-based plane. A number of 3D Tetris versions are   Chapter 5  50   available, which established a far more complex mediated space that includes  its own camera controls and visualization rules; multiplayer versions of Tetris can offer chat options and cross connections between the different player per- formances,  which  exceed  the  sheer  rule-deﬁ ned  game  space  and  incorporate  strategies applied by the other players as well as extend the social space. These  titles operate on planes, and open up gameplay to a more complex and selective  comprehension. The narrative level of the original Tetris is limited because its  spatial qualities are limited.  In  3D  game  worlds,  any  speciﬁ c  route  the  interactor  might  use  to  navigate through the game world of Zelda’s Hyrule is a negotiation with the  structure and the rules coded into the environment; any discovery of a missing  puzzle item in Lara Croft’s Tomb Raider levels, the creation of a city in SimCity, the  troop  maneuver  in  Warcraft,  or  the  chosen  path  in  Deus  Ex  depend  on  spatial conditions, exploration, and comprehension. Based on the growth of  the text from this spatial freedom, we have to reverse Laurel’s argument. In  a 3D video game, one has to write one’s own play in space by acting in it.  Events need to be deﬁ ned and realized in their spatiotemporal setting by the  player. Applying Brooks and Iser’s theories, the comprehension of this per- sonal experience is seen as the plot. Because the plot, then, is an active inter- pretation  of  the  ﬁ ctional  world,  we  can  make  the  argument  that  a  user’s  immersion in a video game space is enhanced, not broken, through the cogni- tive  processes  that  lead  to  the  creation  of  individual  plots  and  signiﬁ cant  spaces. It also becomes clear that the plot grows from the play and is part of  the ﬁ ctional plane.  Games that do not focus on an imagined world, such as the original Tetris, do not need such a plot. In other titles, the very same interactive event can  generate different plots for different interactors. Because the assessment is a  highly  individualized  operation  and  depends  on  the  circumstances  of  each  player,  the  results  can  vary  widely.  What  might  appear  to  be  a  successful  “fragfest” for one group of online players of Counter-Strike will be remembered  as a horrible day of defeat by their opponents. The decision-making moment  in the dungeons of Silent Hill might be highly engaging for some players, but  a mere opportunity for more virtual killing for others. Plot resides in the ﬁ c- tional plane and, although it is evoked by the game experience, its formation  is  subject  to  personal  taste,  physical  condition,  personal  interest,  social  sphere—in  short,  to  any  element  shaping  the  player’s  personality  in  the  real  world.  Because  it  is  living  in  the  ﬁ ctional  space  and  is  highly  player- dependent, it can grow to unexpected results. Players can imagine a greater  space  than  actually  exists,  as  Lyle  Rains  remembers  in  regard  to  the  Atari  game Battlezone  Hoff 1980 : “One letter came in from a Battlezone fan who   Combining Interaction and Narrative  51   said that a friend of his had told him that if you drove far enough you ﬁ nally  got to the volcano, and if you drove over the top of the volcano, you could go  down into the crater. And he said that inside the crater there was a castle, and  that you could go inside and explore the castle. Of course, none of this was  true. It was a great little story to get from a fan. Who knows, we may yet do  a volcano with a castle in it”  Atari Library n.d. .  Plot  is  the  basis  from  which  a  retelling  of  a  game  experience  is  created.  This retelling is outside the framework of the game. That is why it cannot be  directly included in this framework of narrative features that operate in-game  but it is a sign of the evocative narrative elements at work. We can compare  it to a retelling of a holiday stay or a cinema visit.  5.2  Function and Plot  A formalist’s view of the plot would assume that it is constituted by certain  ﬁ xed elements. In traditional linear media, such as folktales, ﬁ lm, or books,  only  the  storyteller  has  the  privilege  of  arranging  a  certain  variety  of  what  Propp terms “functions”  1968  so as to create a comprehensible work telling  the  story,  whereby:  “Function  is  understood  as  an  act  of  a  character,  deﬁ ned  from the point of view of its signiﬁ cance in the unfolding intrigue of the story”  ibid.,  21;  italics  in  original .  Propp  developed  thirty-one  functions  from  an  analysis of Russian folktales. He argues that these functions can be arranged  following mathematical rules to generate the structure of each of the folktales  in question.  A number of analyses of interactive pieces have applied Propp’s method.  The ﬁ rst Ph.D. thesis  Buckles 1985  on video games as texts referred to Propp  in an analysis of the text-adventure Adventure  Crowther and Woods 1976 .  Researchers in the ﬁ elds of artiﬁ cial intelligence and interactive ﬁ ction were  also inspired by Propp’s model  from Meehan 1976 to Weyhrauch 1997 to  Szilas 1999 and Fairclough and Cunningham 2003 .  But there are a lot of problems with a too-literal adaptation of the model.  Many players opt out of any given story and instead engage in less goal-driven  communicative  patterns  or  sheer  spatial  exploration.  The  player-centered  approach proposed here identiﬁ ed plot in 3D video games as a form of users’  comprehension—a  shift  from  Propp’s  model  that  does  not  apply  this  kind  of player-focused approach. But his postulate is clearly of value for the rule- driven space in game worlds, and in the analysis of narrative elements within  it.  Propp’s  principles  have  value  as  a  guideline  and  analytical  tool  but  his  results have to be adjusted to the new setting of interactive digital media in  order to work for video games.  Chapter 5  52   A function  in  the  Proppian  sense  is  understood  as  a  function  for  some- thing—namely the progress of the story but because we have placed the story  in the mental eye of the player, the deﬁ nition and operation of functions in  games has to shift in the world of video game spaces. Interactive access applies  functions as “meaningful choices” or “activities” that are available in the ﬁ c- tional world. In the context of interactivity, a hero’s functions are regarded as  active,  verbal  entities  available  to  the  player.  They  empower  the  player  to  do—or do not. Crawford speaks of “verbs,” “nouns,” and “adjectives” that are  provided by the designer of a game. Crawford calls speciﬁ cally for verbs to  identify what “you want your user to be able to accomplish with your program”   2002, 62 . It is up to the player to call the individual functions into existence  through ergodic participation. Realizing a verb or interactive event assembles  the vocabulary into the unique and personal virtual performance of the player.  It is a creative act, which can only happen in the textual process during the  run-time execution of the underlying code. One important difference is that  Crawford does not force a limited matrix of verbs onto a player.  Notably, the functions or verbs in a video game are not restricted to the  format of Russian folktales, which is the speciﬁ c area of research of Propp’s  investigation. Instead, they might concentrate on entirely different narrative  forms, which have not been accounted for by Propp. Any postmodern, mul- tiperspective, and open-ended text would be difﬁ cult to constrain to Propp’s  concepts. Yet any navigable 3D space can support those forms.  In  a  game,  functions  might  be  provided  by  the  designer  but  are  player- dependent  in  their  execution.  They  do  not  arrange  themselves  into  a  given  formula but are arranged by the player through their execution in the game  world. Lara Croft, game icon and hero of the Tomb Raider series, has a certain  range of functions that allow her to jump, run, walk, swim, and shoot, as well  as perform various other moves. These actions might be limited and directly  correspond to the game world design. Lara’s jumping abilities, for example,  deﬁ ne the distances between different ledges and other surfaces. They directly  affect the level design. Deﬁ ning these game-speciﬁ c functions provides a valu- able element for structuring interactive access and positioning evocative ele- ments in game spaces. Realizing them in a concrete gaming session is left to  the  player.  When  the  textual  machine  is  at  work,  it  transfers  control  over  them to the player. Where the function patterns become too prescriptive and  formulaic—for example, in the exact input patterns a player had to follow to  ﬁ nish Dyer’s Dragon’s Lair  Dyer 1983 —the play gets prescribed.  Interacting with and navigating in a 3D video game world are less limited  functions. If anything, we have seen an expansion of this freedom in the “free- roaming” game world of Grand Theft Auto III, which applies clearly restricted   Combining Interaction and Narrative  53   interactive options in regard to each element within the world: objects, cars,  buildings,  other  characters.  Indeed,  the  limitations  of  the  characters  force  them  often  into  archetypical  schemata  not  unlike  Propp’s  archetypes.  But  their assembly along a free-chosen path of the player through the game world  hides  the  system’s  limitations  and  projects  the  illusion  of  a  complex  game  world. Liberty City, the virtual space of Grand Theft Auto III, can be inter- preted  as  the  spatial  universe  that  qualitatively  changes  and  combines  the  limited character attributes of the inhabiting non-player characters. Because  they all seem to live and act in such a huge open world, they appear to be  more complex themselves. That is why Grand Theft Auto III’s Liberty City is  a example of the way in which virtual space offers a genre-defying arena for  free play, where Proppian functions can deﬁ ne interactive options but add up  to a rich and less-conﬁ ned possibility space.  5.3  Discourse  During  the  growth  of  the  structuralist  movement  in  the  1970s,  language  became a central point of departure for narratology. The position of the reader  in relation to the text became a new focal point in the discourse. Discourse, in its widest sense, has been deﬁ ned by Benveniste as “every utterance assum- ing a speaker and a hearer, and in the speaker, the intention of inﬂ uencing  the  other  in  some  way”   1971,  209 .  The  form  of  the  discourse  varies  and  can  almost  seamlessly  blend  from  oral  to  written  language  and  by  exten- sion—as  Chatman  highlights—between  any  expressive  medium   Chatman  1978,  31 .  Later  approaches  have  further  strengthened  the  position  of  the  reader listener  in  the  discourse  and  inﬂ uenced  the  work  of  Todorov  and  Barthes, among others. This has continued with the discussion in hypertext  and game studies.  Bolter  argued  that  the  notion  of  “readings”  replaces  the  “story”  in  the  encounter of a hypertext such as Joyce’s afternoon, a story  see also Bolter 2001,  125 . To adapt the discourse to video games, interfaces offer options to the  user in the form of possible activities. Performing one of these possible activi- ties allows players to evoke the event in the video game world and deliver a  form of Benveniste’s “utterance.” Players do not bash buttons for the sake of  doing so but because of some signiﬁ cance they ﬁ lter from the game and assign  to the outcome of that button-click and its effects on the game world. Interac- tion is usually intentional.  The discourse in video games comes to life through the interactive func- tionality,  but  also  on  the  level  of  the  presentation.  Video  games  still  tell.  There is an inherent situation of narration in playing a video game because   Chapter 5  54   each game includes the mediated plane. This necessarily opposes some funda- mental  ludologist  statements   see  Juul  2001;  Eskelinen  2001a   but  seems  inevitable.  There  are  few  possible  interactions  in  3D  video  games  without  spatiotemporal localization, and there are no events without a description. The  dominating form of presentation in video games is the cinematic mediation  of sound and moving images, which narrates the events back to the interactor  during the interaction itself and constitutes the telling of the evocative nar- rative  elements.  If  every  3D  video  game  needs  this  presentation  and  at  the  heart of this telling we ﬁ nd a narrative process, does this transform every 3D  game into a story? The simple answer is “no.”  The  presentation  affects  the  narrative  quality  in  games  but  the  mean - ing  and  plot  assembly  remain  with  the  player.  The  very  same  discourse  also includes, for example, clear ludic aspects in the player’s interaction, or  social  aspects  in  player-to-player  communications.  Localizing  the  narrative  situation in games does not exclude other qualities that operate in connection  to it.  What  we  encounter  in  the  narrative  situation  is  a  level  of  narrating. Genette—one of many narratologists drawing from Benveniste—deﬁ ned nar- rating as “the producing narrative action and, by extension, the whole of the  real or ﬁ ctional situation in which that action takes place”  1980, 27 . Like- wise, we ﬁ nd a distinction between event and telling of event in video games.  Often the player might control the actions but their presentation is deﬁ ned  by the game system. Narrating is either entirely controlled by the system or  at least restricted by the limitations set in the game. For example, the freedom  of the virtual camera, an entity necessary to interpret and narrate the 3D space,  can be heavily constrained. Through this shaping of the narration, the game  inﬂ uences the discourse not only on the level of the provided interactive func- tions, but also through their presentation. That does not mean, however, that  games turn into movies.  Narrating in video game spaces differs from that of ﬁ xed literary or cine- matic pieces. It occurs at the same time as the generation of the interactive  event and is inﬂ uenced by it. While literary, cinematic, and many oral forms  of narrating build on events past and retold, real-time virtual worlds—like  live television or radio broadcasts—narrate the events at the moment of their  manifestation. Because of the speciﬁ cs of 3D game worlds, which allow vari- able  camera  and  sound  work  to  customize  the  presentation,  the  narrating  becomes highly ﬂ exible and rich.  These narrating and mediating elements have to be utilized and approached  as valuable expressive vocabulary. They are in no way restricting the interac- tive functionality of 3D video games but are an essential part of their nature   Combining Interaction and Narrative  55   as  mediated  and  player-dependent  texts.  Players  can  only  interact  with  the  game elements as they are presented to them via the narrating entities  like  the virtual camera  and the event can only be narrated when created by the  player. In video games, interacting and narrating are dependent on each other.  In game spaces, any situated interactive event and its presentation are inter- twined. The frequent criticism that confusing camera angles in video games  complicate the playing of the game is one indication of how one affects the  other and how interconnected the two worlds are. Part II of this book will  investigate the way games present their virtual spaces in more detail.  The combination of narrative and interactive elements ultimately has relo- cated the narrative operations. The fabula is connected to the playing of the  game: the interrelation of rule-based space and play space as events are gener- ated; the sjužet is still heavily driven by the game system; the discourse grows  from a combination of these interactive events and their speciﬁ c event narra- tion. It encourages the player to form a plot as a way of comprehension of the  interactive situation and a means for further interaction.  What,  then,  are  typical  spatial  structures  of  3D  video  game  spaces  that  might shape the player experience into a meaningful whole? What are space- driven occasions, in which narrative elements of given game spaces meet with  player activities?  5.4  Quests  A range of models has been suggested for a structuring of video games and  other new media artifacts, and a number of them have been implemented in  commercial  as  well  as  academic  environments.  Some  scholars  have  applied  Aristotelian dramatic principles to interactive pieces  e.g., Laurel 1986, 1993;  Meadows 2002 ; others have used these principles as references but reshaped  them into new frameworks  e.g., Mateas 2002 ; and various dramatic struc- tures have been used  and taught  for interactive digital media  e.g., Wim- berley  and  Samsel  1995;  Garrand  1997;  Siegel  1996 .  Opposing  such  an  approach,  some  ludologists   e.g.,  Juul  1999;  Eskelinen  2001a   as  well  as  hypertext theorists  Landow 1997  have rejected any adaptation of Aristotle’s  principles  for  interactive  media,  or  have  offered  different  references   e.g.,  Frasca 2001, which suggests Boal as a different theatrical model . Approach- ing a possible dramatic structure from the vantage point of space, the follow- ing  paragraphs  will  argue  not  based  on  an  existing  theatrical  structure  but  from the notion of movement and possible dramatic structures evolving from  its  realization  in  game  worlds.  The  structure  that  covers  this  space-driven  approach best is the idea of the quest.  Chapter 5  56   Video  game  worlds  are  not  limited  to  a  depiction  of  motion  such  as  ﬁ lm—they contain it. Unlike the conditional links and passages of MUDs or  hypertextual structures, the navigation of 3D video game spaces offers a mul- tidimensional form of interaction.  Grand Theft Auto III is a game where the player is staged as a small-time  criminal on his way to greater fame and notoriety. I got completely distracted  from that path when I encountered one type of optional sub-mission in the  game. Grand  Theft  Auto  III  offers  randomized  taxi  missions.  To  do  a  taxi  mission in Grand Theft Auto III, I have to hijack a taxi, master the handling  of this speciﬁ c virtual car, ﬁ nd a passenger looking for a ride, compete with  other trafﬁ c, and ﬁ nd the best and shortest route through the city to the des- ignation.  Once  the  ﬁ rst  passenger  is  delivered  I  might  ﬁ nd  more  random  passenger pickups and continue. I am on constantly changing missions that  clearly  involve  me  in  the  game’s  urban  landscape.  As  I  become  part  of  the  ﬂ owing  trafﬁ c  and  the  world  of  Liberty  City,  I  engage  with  the  space—far  more so, for example, than in Tetris. Tetris is a direct engagement with the  spatial as an abstraction. It is about spatial logical relationships but does not  allow for an exploration of changes between them. The single static screen of  a level in Tetris does not allow for shortcuts or customized exploration. Players  do not proceed through this world but deal with the abstract relations within  it, turning and positioning the falling blocks appropriately. In contrast, my  virtual travels stand out as typical experiences of 3D video game spaces. From  the moment of ﬁ nding the right car to the delivery of another costumer, the  structure of the taxi missions mirror largely that of simpliﬁ ed quests in virtual  space.  At  the  same  time,  quests  have  been  heavily  investigated  in  literary  studies. The following paragraphs will try to combine the two.  Movement  in  virtual  worlds  can  be  intuitive,  as  we  project  our  well- established physical spatial experience into the use of those virtual spaces. At  the same time, movement is complex and “deep” in its variety and interaction.  That is why movement and the presentation of movement heavily inﬂ uence the  emerging discourse. This leads to a new focus on spatial design and architecture  in games and has left its mark on the role of the designer of these environments.  According to Walser  cited in Rheingold 1991, 286 : “Whereas the playwright  and  the  ﬁ lmmaker  both  try  to  communicate  the  idea  of  an  experience,  the  spacemaker  tries  to  communicate  the  experience  itself.  .  .  .  Thus  the  space- maker can never hope to communicate a particular reality, but only to set up  opportunities  for  certain  kinds  of  realities  to  emerge.  The  ﬁ lmmaker  says,  ‘Look, I’ll show you.’ The spacemaker says, ‘Here, I’ll help you discover.’ ”  No ultimate, dramatic über-structure can be deﬁ ned for video games. They  are  too  diverse  for  such  an  attempt.  But  a  spacemaker  provides  experiences   Combining Interaction and Narrative  57   through the structure of the virtual world. The designers of Grand Theft Auto  III’s Liberty City had to decide on the layout and appearance as well as the  contents of their city. This fundamental way of shaping can be a starting point  in  the  search  for  a  suitable  dramatic  form.  For  a  player,  this  spatial urban  design  affects  their  constant  interaction  as  movement.  It  changes  the  logic  and form of their spatial progression and points to the motif of the epic quest.  Quests have become a point of interest in a range of game study essays  Aarseth  2004; Fuller and Jenkins 1995; Jenkins and Squire 2002; Jenkins 2004; Tosca  2003; Tronstad 2001; Wibroe, Nygaard, and Bøgh Andersen 2001 . As each  scholar applies a slightly new perspective to the issue, a short clariﬁ cation of  what a quest is seems necessary.  Here, the idea of the quest starts from movement in  virtual  spaces and  the idea of traveling through a world. Travels have been acknowledged as a  powerful literary feature: De Certeau even argued that every story is a travel  story, as it has to include spatial practices that localize events  Certeau 1984 .  These travels can be used by the spacemaker and form an essential ingredient  of 3D game worlds that stands out as a spatially deﬁ ned pointer to possible  dramatic structures. Fuller and Jenkins established this connection and out- lined the parallel between literary travel logs and explorations of virtual spaces   1995 . Every event in these worlds has a certain time and a certain location  and both are often connected to a virtual journey through the environment  that  is  ﬁ lled  with  moments  of  exploration  and  discovery.  Consequently,  Jenkins suggests that we should “think of game designers less as storytellers  than as narrative architects”  2004, 129  who “don’t simply tell stories; they  design  worlds  and  sculpt  spaces”   ibid.,  121 .  His  approach  reiterates  the  spacemaker principle but adds the idea of narrative elements to it. Space can  offer  direction  for  narrative  comprehension,  and  this  book  argues  that  this  direction can be supported by evocative narrative elements.  On the side of the player, these sculpted spaces provide the quest where  spatial comprehension, navigation, and mastery deﬁ ne victory or defeat, prog- ress or entrapment. Players grow into the quest, using the narrative elements  provided by the game as reference points to position themselves on the quest   this  is  what  Tosca  [2003]  termed  the  “semantical  quest” .  Like  any  useful  structural model for content in video games, quests grow from a combination  of  the  various  spatial  planes  involved.  Ultimately,  every  player  embarks  on  his or her own unique quest. But for the spacemaker, the term offers a struc- tural  model.  It  provides  a  guideline  to  position  the  evocative  narrative  ele- ments. The question, then, is whether these quests have any typical, intrinsic  structure.  Chapter 5  58   It  does  not  come  as  a  surprise  that  a  structuralist  like  Propp  provides  a  pattern for quests based on the functions he established before. In his model,  the hero has to make his way from an initial situation  e.g., hero loves princess  and  wants  to  marry  her ,  to  a  preparatory  section   e.g.,  the  queen  mother  forbids the wedding because the hero is not a knight or prince , to a complica- tion section  e.g., but the kingdom is plagued by an evil witch, and killing  the witch would get the hero knighthood , to a donor section  e.g., hero travels  through the kingdom and meets a wise woman, who gives him a magic potion  to defeat the witch , to action section  e.g., hero ﬁ nds witch and defeats her  using the magic potion , from where the action either repeats  e.g., the queen  mother  demands  another  proof ,  or  it  ends   e.g.,  hero  marries  princess  and  they live happily ever after . Propp describes each step along this journey with  the previously mentioned functions. In his approach, the quest is a conglomer- ate of story functions residing in the written text and the hero is but one part  of it. Heroes follow the given path along a ﬁ xed trajectory.  Other approaches are more centered on the ﬁ gure of the hero and interpret  quests as processes of personal growth and maturing of the hero. Such a char- acter-based  approach  better  supports  the  focus  on  the  player’s  experience  through design. A widespread model is that of Joseph Campbell. Inﬂ uenced  by Jung, Campbell developed a cyclic quest model, the “Hero’s Journey,” that  uses the idea of the “monomyth”     J. Campbell 1968 . Campbell argues that  the monomyth provides a basic frame for any myth or quest structure. Fol- lowers  of  Campbell’s  theories  even  transfer  the  model  to  other  disciplines.  Vogler  argues,  for  example,  that  the  monomythical  view  toward  a  quest  is  relevant  not  only  for  analysis  of  narrative  pieces  but  also  for  the  writing  process. The writer’s own life can be seen as a form of a quest  Vogler 1992 .  It  is  impossible  to  conﬁ rm  or  disprove  such  an  all-embracing  approach.  However,  the  monomyth  model  does  offer  one  possible  way  to  imagine  a  dramatic form that is rooted in the element of the video game space and its  exploration.  It  is  relevant,  because  it  can  be  applied  to  the  comprehension  processes thanks to its gradual character development. At the same time, it  depends on the hero’s actions to further develop. The quest is not found in  the  realms  of  the  ﬁ xed  work  but  in  the  experience  of  the  player.  Its  basic  structural schemata however remain.  References  to  the  monomyth  model  have  been  drawn  before   e.g.,  Dunniway 2000 or Tosca 2003 , but as this chapter has shifted the production  of narrative to the player, we look at the monomyth not as an act-like form  that can be condensed to a level-driven, “numbered” structure, but as a guide  for a space-driven approach to Campbell’s principles.  Combining Interaction and Narrative  59   5.5  The Concept of the Monomyth  Joseph Campbell suggested that it does not matter “whether we listen with  aloof  amusement  to  the  dreamlike  mumbo  jumbo  of  some  red-eyed  witch  doctor of the Congo, or read with cultivated rapture thin translations from  the sonnets of the mystic Lao-tse; now and again crack the hard nutshell of  an argument of Aquinas, or catch suddenly the shining meaning of a bizarre  Eskimo  fairy  tale:  it  will  be  always  the  one,  shapeshifting  yet  marvelously  constant story that we ﬁ nd, together with a challengingly persistent sugges- tion of more remaining to be experienced than will ever be known or told”   1968, 3 .  Vogler  translated  the  monomyth  model  into  a  practical  guide  for  writing  screenplays  that  has  been  embraced  by  many  ﬁ lmmakers  and  screenwriters   Schlesinger  and  Cunningham  1996;  Voytilla  1999 .  A  Hero’s  Journey  along the monomyth circle can be summarized as follows: The upper half of  the circle represents the hero’s ordinary world, which is subject to the lack  of  an  essential  element  or  a  wound  that  needs  healing.  This  initial  threat  to  the  status  quo  in  the  ordinary  world  initiates  the  call  to  adventure  for  the  hero.  But  many  heroes   often  initially  unaware  of  their  heroic  status  and duties  refuse this call at ﬁ rst. With the support of a mentor-character,  the  hesitating  hero  crosses  the  threshold  into  the  world  of  the  adventure   Figure 5.1  “Hero’s Journey” following Vogler’s  1992, 18  adaptation of Campbell’s origi- nal analysis  1968, 245   Chapter 5  60   represented in the lower half of the circle. Referring to Jung, Schlesinger and  Cunningham  describe  Campbell’s  ordinary  world  as  the  “day”  world  of  the  consciousness, opposing it to the special world of “night” and the unconscious   Schlesinger and Cunningham 1996 . The hero has to enter this special world  of the adventure and often has to face his own inner demons to save the world.  The special world tests the hero through encounters with friends and enemies  on the way to the most threatening central locus of the problem: the supreme  ordeal, often a death or near-death situation for the hero. Passing the supreme  ordeal grants the hero the reward of the “elixir” needed to heal the ordinary  world. The hero often changes and transforms during these adventures. This  transformed hero returns to the ordinary world, and brings the elixir as the  healing prize to ﬁ ll the needs of the ordinary world, thereby healing the wound  that necessitated the Hero’s Journey in the ﬁ rst place  for the original descrip- tion, see J. Campbell 1968, 245–246 .  The claim of universal applicability made for the monomyth does not go  undisputed—even  in  narratology  circles.  French  rejects  it  as  “sophomoric  oversimpliﬁ cation”  1998, 40 . Likewise, Walker rejects Campbell’s reduction  to one single universal myth  S. Walker 2002, 4; also 114  and argues that  such a generalization sidesteps the highly personal emotional response of an  individual  to  archetypal  images.  This  response  is  crucial  for  the  individual  experience and the claim to universality ignores the vast diversity of myths  known to us. Walker’s critique touches on a fundamental element of video  games, namely that the individual experience of a game is unique and difﬁ cult  to summarize into one common model. This tension is present in game worlds  at the intersection of rule-based and ﬁ ctional planes. Forcing the monomyth  too literally onto the game might ignore fundamental needs of gameplay that  demand freedom and creativity. That is why the model is not suggested as a  universal content-structuring formula in video game spaces, but primarily as  a method for deciphering events in them.  Ultimately, the quest is conducted by the player and merely evoked and  encouraged by the game system. Likewise, the monomyth applies primarily  to the player. Yet, aware of this effect, one has to recognize it in the space- making process. The game designer can support a basic monomythical struc- ture  through  the  use  of  the  evocative  narrative  elements.  That  is  why  the  Hero’s  Journey  has  value  as  a  useful  model  for  the  comprehension—and  in  return the possible design—of 3D game worlds. It is valuable because of three  key reasons.  First,  there  is  a  strong  connection  between  a  spatial  or  personal  quest  and the various stages of Campbell’s model. The monomythical structure is a  character-centered model that depends on a voyage of discovery, which may be   Combining Interaction and Narrative  61   self-discovery as well as discovery of new territory—or both. It mirrors the  growing mastery of the game space by the player and the development of the  player in relation to the video game world. The model is very ﬂ exible. If we see  the game experience as growing from all ﬁ ve spatial planes, quests transcend  these planes. A player might organize a raid in a multiplayer world using email  or some chat program. That means that the ﬁ rst stages of the quest were already  realized before the player logged into the game. Other players might start a  quest but never ﬁ nish it, or be sidetracked in other tasks. Players might share  the same game event on opposing ends of the spatially deﬁ ned quest, or they  might depend on each other in a collaboration mode. Social plane and rule- based plane interlock in these events, and although the results vary widely they  can still be framed as quests.  Second,  the  model’s  widespread  use  in  successful  ﬁ lm  and  television  narratives  Voytilla 1999 , many folktales  J. Campbell 1968 , and other tra- ditional narratives  such as literary pieces ranging from the Iliad to Tolkien’s  Lord of the Rings  1966  that have been adapted in many other media  indicate  its  relevance  for  audience  expectations.  Especially  audiences  of  mainstream  Hollywood  movies  have  been  trained  to  decipher  monomythical  structures.  This increases the likelihood of a reading of the game events in accordance  with the monomyth. Limiting as the dominance of one narrative form may  be, it means that players are familiar with the structure and—consciously or  not—look for clues to generate the context along this formula’s method. In  other  words,  it  has  become  a  convention.  Thus,  a  video  game  can  utilize  the widespread acceptance of the monomyth for its own goal to engage the  player better.  Third, another value of the monomyth structure for video game spaces is  the  fact  that  its  original  concept  does  not  dictate  dramatic  high  points  at  predeﬁ ned moments within a certain timeframe. It is true that the adaptation  of the monomyth into recording media, such as ﬁ lm, has forced the circle to  unfold within a timeframe dictated by commercial and industrial standards.  Twentieth-century  recording  and  distribution  methods  forced  the  playing  times  of  movies  and  TV  shows  into  ﬁ xed  time  slots  and  program  formats.  Authors and ﬁ lmmakers have responded by ﬁ tting the pace of their narratives  into  these  formats,  in  the  form  of  commercial-break-interrupted  television  show or feature ﬁ lm lengths. Restrictions like these depend on a commercial  format  that  demands  a  precise  timing  of  plot  points,  cliffhangers,  and  climaxes and forced the Hero’s Journey into set timeframes. That is why script  doctor Syd Field  1994  can demand that a certain plot point has to be on a  certain page. Such uniformity was never implied in the original model, for  which  Campbell  himself  stated  that  stories  could  concentrate  on  different   Chapter 5  62   parts of the circle or might rearrange and serialize them. The spatial explora- tion of a video game world via movement depends on the player’s participa- tion,  which  generates  a  unique  timeframe  and  event  realization.  In  return,  this  frees  the  content  structures  from  the  time  constraints  of  other  formats  and restores to the Hero’s Journey its original temporal freedom. Games can  include  time  restrictions  and  countdowns,  but  these  merely  reproduce  the  commercial television’s strife for set dramatic blocks. A player’s exploration  of the game space can be  and often is  independent from any temporal pre- conditions. A fan of the taxi missions in Grand Theft Auto III can avoid the  main  missions  for  any  time.  These  factors  interrupt  the  gradual  rise  of  the  thug to a crime lord but there is still continuous participation in the game  universe. A player of World of Warcraft can travel the virtual lands and mine  their resources without participating in the planted mission system. This is  the  basis  for  the  practice  of  gold  mining  where  players  mine  the  virtual  grounds for goods and disregard the game’s dramatic setting completely. The  game worlds are rich enough to provide enough options for personal quests  that might avoid the central dramatic setting altogether. This supports the  shift of the narrative elements out of the ﬁ xed work and into the realm of the  player and the player’s event realization.  Events along the Hero’s Journey do have a logical and narrative order in  relation to each other but no absolute ﬁ xed position in a deﬁ ned timeframe.  The different stages of the circle can vary in size, number, and order. There  might be only one test in the world of the adventure or there can be dozens.  A  virtual  hero  might  immediately  accept  a  call  to  the  adventure  or  might  need a mentor’s help. As Campbell notes: “The changes rung on the simple  scale of the monomyth defy description”  1968, 246 .  Thanks to such ﬂ exibility, the Hero’s Journey can be applied to the whole  Odyssey or just a single adventure in it, to the entire Star Wars saga or just  one ﬁ lm in it  see Voytilla 1999 , a whole interactive experience of a video  game space or just a small segment of it. Such a ﬂ exible form is very promis- ing for structuring game spaces and their experiences, as it does not depend  on a ﬁ xed ending but can stretch one into inﬁ nity, into a never-ending Odyssey setting—an “ever-quest” in which the progression depends on the individual  explorer.  The  ﬂ exibility  of  the  Hero’s  Journey  structure  can  be  illustrated  by  its  operation on player-deﬁ ned goals within a video game space. Often, players  do not follow the goals intended by the designers, but embark on self-deﬁ ned  targets  and  develop  their  own  quests  in  the  game  world  that  the  designer  may never have anticipated. Interactors can set themselves goals outside the  dramatic demands set by the ﬁ ctional world.  Combining Interaction and Narrative  63   The original video game Quake teleports the player into the role of a lone  space marine on an alien planet cast to face and defeat the enemy code-named  “Quake”  in  progressive  levels.  The  basic  goals  of  the  game  are  to  proceed,  survive,  and  kill.  The  Quake  done  Quick  players,  a  community  of  dedicated  Quake players, changed these rules to “survive and proceed  and kill  in the  fastest possible way.” They added the extra difﬁ culty of an optimized perfor- mance time to the original setting. This fundamentally changed the interac- tion with the game world and the playing experience. No changes to the game  itself were made and the expert players play the entire game without cheating,  but  these  players  develop  movement  patterns  and  interactions  that  differ  from a typical player’s behavior. For example, they use virtual blast waves of  their own grenades as near-suicidal jump pads to catapult themselves faster  through  levels.  They  have  optimized  the  time  in  their  so-called  speed-runs  to  twelve  minutes  and  twenty-three  seconds  for  the  entire  game  played  on  the most difﬁ cult level  see the speed-run Quake done Quick with a Vengeance released  on  September  13,  2000 —a  feat  that  might  take  a  regular  player  hours.  Their  speed-runs  still  demonstrate  a  mastery  of  space  and  entities  within the game world, yet optimized to their own terms. Theirs is a different  quest in Quake, but one that is still unfolding in the given game space. Goals,  stages,  difﬁ culties,  and  mastery  are  scaled  up  or  down  to  the  individual  player’s approach.  Ultimately, it is up to the player to drive the exploration of the video game  world, which can initiate a Hero’s Journey, but the monomyth offers a power- ful tool to recognize these journeys and optimize the structure of the game  world accordingly. The spacemaker sends players into the game world not to  follow a predeﬁ ned tale delivered through a linear medium but instead stages  them in the center of the events that come to life through their participation.  The timing of the events depends on their spatial interaction. The result is a  form of quest that comes to live in the player’s comprehension and his or her  interaction with the game space. Not only can monomythical principles be  used  to  support  and  analyze  players’  comprehension,  they  also  can  inform  game world design. The monomyth model provides a scalable and adjustable  matrix to help designers envision the way in which users might make sense  of the events they encounter in a game world. It provides access to one possible  structural  approach  that  is  spatially  dependent  and  less  rigid  than  other  solutions.  Aarseth is correct in his overall claim that “the purpose of adventure games  is to enable players to fulﬁ ll quests. This, not storytelling, is their dominant  structure”   2004,  368 .  Yet  comprehension  of  game  elements  during  play  is  where  the  narrative  elements  come  to  work  in  the  discourse.  Without   Chapter 5  64   narrative  elements,  a  3D  video  game  would  be  in  danger  of  disintegrating  into  singular  unconnected  splinters  of  momentary  interaction.  The  quest  model offers one way to connect these instances through a narrative framework  suitable for game spaces and promises to support a meaningful comprehension  through  spatial  structuring.  In  this  regard,  the  concept  of  the  monomyth  promises to support engaging game worlds as it offers some structural format  but leaves its realization open to the player.  Interactive  and  narrative  elements  merge  in  the  actual  experience  and  realization  of  the  interactive  event  inside  the  game  world.  The  game  space  encompasses and situates these elements while the game system narrates them  to the player. If we have a mainly cinematic form of presentation, where do  video game space and cinematic presentation overlap and where do they differ?  What are the consequences? Part II explores the element of audiovisual pre- sentation, which is the dominating form for narrating in video games. The  chapters outline parallels and differences between the creation of virtual game  spaces and cinematic spaces. In addition, the discussion focuses on the evolv- ing narrative perspective and the position of the interactor in relation to the  ﬁ ctional world before a ﬁ nal analysis of the resulting spatiotemporal setting  closes part II.  Combining Interaction and Narrative  65    II  Presentation  Presentation is understood as the expressive and representational element of 3D  video games, and the way they present the data of the rule-driven plane in  the mediated plane. It is only through some form of presentation that a video  game becomes legible to a player. Consequently, this seemingly noninterac- tive layer has a profound impact on the interaction. On the level of consumer  electronics, the technology mainly provides elaborate audiovisual and limited  haptic forms of presentation through their output devices. Moving images are  the  dominating  representation  of  continuous  movement  in  space,  and  cine- matic techniques are the most elaborate forms of these moving images. That  is why the analysis will concentrate ﬁ rst on cinematic visualization. Following  the discussion of the visuals is an overview of the audio features available in  video games. Finally, part II addresses the narrative layers that are opened up  through these techniques of presentation.    6  Games as Moving Images  There are a wide variety of 3D game titles spanning all genres and conven- tions. They all share the visualization of a virtual game space by means of the  moving  image.  A  perspective  is  created  toward  the  game  environment  in  which  the  interactive  event  is  localized.  Other  interface  elements  such  as  health  indicators,  ammunition  counters,  maps,  and  timers  have  important  functions in the graphical presentation of a game, as well as in the condition  of  an  interactive  event;  however,  because  this  book  concentrates  on  spatial  features, these interface options will be largely left aside. Instead, the follow- ing  pages  will  look  at  the  3D  video  game  as  a  part  of  the  wider  category  of  media  using  the  moving  image.  The  close  relationship  between  games  and moving images will be further discussed in section 6.3. First, a brief his- torical overview and a look at architecture and the moving image will provide  necessary context.  6.1  A Brief History  Early interactive digital titles like Tennis for Two or Spacewar! used simple 2D  animated  graphics  and  depended  on  moving  images  to  simulate  coherent  movement on a display screen. This dependency stayed part of the history of  video  games.  Continuous  movement  through  the  game  world  has  already  pointed to the use of quests as dramatic structure. It is also a driving force in  the  presentation.  The  illusion  of  movement  in  games  as  well  as  in  ﬁ lm  or  television depends on changing images and the speed of their replacement.  The  demand  for  movement  presented  at  a  high  and  stable  rendering  speed  had enormous impact on the development of many video games. Rendering    out  the  images  as  fast  as  possible  occupied  a  signiﬁ cant  percentage  of  the  processing power available. Keeping this image generation at an acceptable  level often demanded changes in the game design. It potentially limited the  number of active objects on display, their appearance and or behavior, as well  as the resolution of the graphic display itself. In every way, the complexity of  a game’s functionality and its dependency on a ﬂ uent presentation were inter- connected from day one.  With the dawn of more powerful technology, developers started to apply  more elaborate animated 2D graphics, animated 3D vector graphics  e.g., Elite by Braben and Bell [1985] , and polygonal characters  e.g., Alone in the Dark by Raynal [1992] . In addition, new data storage methods like CD-ROMs,  console cartridges, and expansion packs allowed for video-playback capabili- ties in games.  Video played a signiﬁ cant role in the shaping of interactive titles from early  research works such as Lippman’s Aspen Movie Map  1978  and artistic experi- ments  like  Weinbren’s  The  Erlking   1986   to  consumer  products  such  as  Psychic  Detective   Sanborn  1995   and  the  role  of  cutscenes  in  today’s  games.  Whether it was the interface, the lack of interactive access, or other design  issues, for one reason or another, “interactive cinema” on the television plat- form and in the public cinema did not catch the interest of the audience. A  direct mapping of ﬁ lmic traditions onto the game proved to be short-lived.  Still, there is interesting work growing from the overlap of the two media, as  seen in research groups such as Glorianna Davenport’s Interactive Cinema Group at  the  MIT  MediaLab   until  2005 ,  Georgia  Tech’s  eTV  group  under  Janet  Murray, and Lev Manovich’s work on Soft Cinema at the University of Cali- fornia, San Diego. Spreading broadband access and HDTV-ready game con- soles seems to have reawakened some of the early enthusiasm in interactive  television, albeit in a different, more game-related form. While the experi- mental depth and commercial value of interactive cinema remains big, few of  today’s commercial video games claim to be interactive movies a notion that  was  far  more  en  vogue  a  decade  ago  in  titles  such  as  the  Wing  Commander series. Now the game is the leading force in the way moving image traditions  are adapted, changed, or launched in interactive media.  Although the notion of interactive cinema as some form of hybrid between  linear  video  and  interactive  application  in  video  gaming  has  been  largely  abandoned, the combination of full-motion video and gameplay has grown— for  better  or  worse—into  the  tradition  of  the  cutscene  and  hybrids  like  Machinima. The reference to cinema from the video gaming side seemed to  work much better than the attempts of the cinema industry to embrace the  interactive features of video games. Instead of following cinematic production   Chapter 6  70   methods,  games  deal  with  a  remediation  of  cinematic  effects  in  order  to  provide  the  player  with  a  cinema-like  visual  presentation.  CD-i  games  like  the original Dragon’s Lair and games with large amounts of prefabricated video  material, such as The 7th Guest  Landeros 1993 , or Roberta Williams’ Phantas- magoria  Williams 1995  have their place in the history of video games. But  as  graphics  kept  on  improving  and  3D  worlds  became  available,  a  lot  of  the attention shifted from a sheer implementation of video into games to a  less direct adaptation of cinematic techniques in the presentation of these new  3D worlds.  On  the  level  of  consumer  platforms,  a  deﬁ ning  watershed  in  the  use  of  virtual 3D spaces occurred in the year 1995 with the international launch of  the  two  breakthrough  32-bit  consoles  capable  of  3D  graphics—namely,  SEGA’s Saturn and Sony’s PlayStation. Thirty-two-bit technology was avail- able before that, in consoles such as the 3DO  which derived its name from  the fact that it could process 3D graphics  and the Amiga CD32. But while  Commodore, the producer of the Amiga CD32 ﬁ led bankruptcy in 1994 and  the  3DO  died  in  1996,  SEGA  and  Sony  popularized  video  games  to  new  masses and went on to grow into signiﬁ cant contributors to the ﬁ eld. 3D video  game spaces—or pseudo 3D spaces—had been available before on the PC  see,  for  example,  Castle  Wolfenstein  3D  by  Blochowiak,  Carmack,  and  Romero  1992  but the success of these 3D-capable game consoles stands out as a deﬁ n- ing turning point in the rapid growth of video game spaces and their avail- ability to a large consumer base. Games on PCs were riddled with technical  challenges.  Installation  could  be  problematic,  computer  maintenance  was  necessary,  there  were  compatibility  issues,  and  the  games  lacked  a  shared  standard. PCs also come with the stigma of being a tool for work, a part of  our working environment. Games are almost exclusively created on personal  computers—as  are  many  documents,  spread  sheets,  and  tax  reports.  The  console lives more in the leisure world of the television and the video recorder.  While the technical superiority of the constantly updating PC world put it  into  a  prime  spot  for  cutting-edge  developments  compared  to  the  longer  development circles of game consoles, it also meant that players had to “work”  to  get  the  best  performance  for  their  games  on  their  constantly  changing  computer. Consoles changed the play space as they brought the virtual space  out of the ofﬁ ce or the “computer room” and into the living area. One did  not have to be a geek to enter a game world anymore.  Ever since, 3D capabilities have improved and developed toward more and  more detailed representation. Generations of game engines like Epic’s Unreal engine, Id software’s DOOM and Quake, or Valve’s Source engines—all of them  originally conceived for the PC and then adapted to consoles—offer little to   Games as Moving Images  71   no development of their original interactive features. They concentrate pre- dominantly  on  improved  performance  of  3D  graphics.  Visual  detail  has  become the fetish of some game developers who entered into a kind of space  race to the most advanced presentation form. Such a focus on graphics and its  dependency on software and hardware improvements led Mactavish to argue  that a game’s narrative is “about special effects and our astonishment over new  developments in special effects technology”  2002, 43 . Although his point is  well taken as part of the discussion of games as “surface play,” his position  overemphasizes  the  inﬂ uence  of  technical  performance  on  the  enjoyment  of  computer  games.  Effects  are  an  important  factor  to  achieve  the  impact  and  expressive  qualities  of  video  games—narrative  or  not.  But  as  previously  argued, the narrative grows from a comprehension based on interaction with  and reading of the game world.  Mactavish’s  argument  might  apply  to  effect-ridden  cinematic  forms   see  also  K.  Hillis  1999;  King  2000 ,  but  cannot  translate  to  video  games  that  depend on this interactive element. Ndalianis offers a more convincing theory  to this culture of the surface play when she traces the spectacular in contem- porary entertainment back to the baroque. Based on this historical backdrop,  she acknowledges the foregrounding of the technique’s spectacular effects and  techniques. At the same time, she includes the recognition of these technical  production methods as part of the virtuosity and an element of the presented  content. Ndalianis notes, “The spectator, in other words, should recognize the  way science has been placed at the service of artistic skill”  2004, 165 . Her  combination does not replace any visualized narrative with a technical one but  points toward a merging of both that becomes tangible when the scientiﬁ c  and  artistic  production  method  is  revealed  or  addressed  within  the  work.  When visitors enter the Church of St. Ignazio with its trompe l’oeil ceiling  paintings by Andrea Pozzo seemingly stretching right into the heavens, then  the effect is not immediate—unlike the opening sequence of an effect-ridden  blockbuster movie that overwhelms its audience. Visitors to St. Ignazio have  to ﬁ nd the optimal position on the ground to get the full impact of the visual  effect in the paintings. Until they ﬁ nd this spot the art piece reveals its tech- nical origin yet does not reduce one’s awe for the achievement.  Gunning outlined the same effect for early cinema  1989 . Following his  theory of a “cinema of attractions” he sees early movie audiences less absorbed  by the visuals and more as conscious spectators of a technical novelty. This  novelty was in fact constructed and presented to suggest awe as a technique.  “Placed within historical context and tradition,” he wrote, “the ﬁ rst spectators’  experience reveals not a childlike belief, but an undisguised awareness  and  delight in  ﬁ lm’s illusionistic capabilities”  ibid., 45 .  Chapter 6  72   One can easily draw a line from those educated audiences to the community  of video game players that are aware of the technical developments in video  gaming. They might not be coders, but legions of gaming publications not  only preach games as content but also celebrate game consoles’ hardware or  advice on PC upgrades to provide better gaming experiences. Many gamers  are  very  much  aware  of  the  technology  they  use.  The  growing  number  of  postmortem reports and “making of” movies on the creative process in game  production offer further education to the interested player. Technical achieve- ments of a new game or game engine are often marketed as unique selling  points to players. Video games occasionally even reveal the creative process of  game production within the game world itself.  I traveled far and wide through the world of Spira, the game universe of  Final  Fantasy  X   Kitase  2001   before  I  reached  the  “Luca  Sphere  Theater.”  Until then my adventures had unlocked beautifully rendered cutscenes and  the soundtrack seemed to continuously grow. The Luca Sphere Theater is an  in-game space that allows me to revisit  “buy”  most of the music and video  clips as I uncover them and “play” them in a virtual projection room inside  the game world. The music and the cutscenes are made available inside the  game world but outside their original context as special events.  The presentation references the game’s technological nature and its produc- tion process by reusing its exceptionally high-standard ﬁ lm and musical assets  and  it  does  so  within  a  continuous  game  space.  The  3D  world  hosts  both,  documentation of the production process as well as the result of this produc- tion, the game universe. A visitor to the Luca Sphere Theater stays immersed  in  the  game  world  but  rediscovers  the  art  of  the  game’s  production.  Other  titles provide access to conceptual artwork created by the game’s artist in the  pre-production process. Prince of Persia: Warrior Within  Mallat 2004  allows  players to gradually unlock concept art through an exploration of the diegetic  video game space. Finding another piece of this production puzzle is set up  as a reward for successful game mastery. Thus, the gradual uncovering of the  behind-the-scenes elements goes hand in hand with a growing mastery of the  game world. The technical feats of the game creation and the growing ability  of the player in the mastering of the video game world interconnect. In these  cases Mactavish’s argument ﬁ ts, but it still remains a side aspect of the main  game experience, which more often centers on task and settings within the  ﬁ ctional game world.  To interact with the virtual space the player has to look through the tech- nology  and  deal  with  the  representation.  Gunning  argues  in  regard  to  the  Lumières’ L’Arrivée  d’un  Train  à  Ciotat   Arrival  of  a  Train  at  the  Station    Lumière and Lumière 1895  that the “train collided with no one. It was, as   Games as Moving Images  73   Gorky said, a train of shadows, and the threat that it bore was freighted with  emptiness”  Gunning 1989, 45 . In a video game the train would collide with  a character if no evasive action were taken—and an impact would change the  player’s position. That is why narrative comprehension remains necessary even  for the tech-savvy game player.  But  Mactavish’s  cross-referencing  to  cinema  highlights  the  spectacularly  improving graphic performances that allow events in virtual games spaces to  unfold at a visual quality ever closer to that of video. Game consoles broke  the 64-bit  Atari’s ill-fated Jaguar claim a heavily disputed ﬁ rst place here   and 128-bit  with SEGA’s Dreamcast  thresholds. Multiprocessors and spe- cialized chip sets in consoles and PCs opened up even more powerful perfor- mances. The visual qualities of 3D video games and traditional moving images  are  leveling  up  as  game  pictures  become  more  and  more  indistinguishable  from  video  images,  and  as  technologies  like  HDTV  are  embraced  by  game  technology. Not surprisingly, stylistic cross-fertilization and cross-referencing  between cinema and video games have been identiﬁ ed from Nelson  1990  to  Bolter  1997  to King and Krzywinska  2002  to Wolf  2002  and Wolf and  Perron  2003 , among others. In fact, these references have been applied to a  degree  that  evoked  the  notion  of  “cinema  envy”   as  mentioned  by  Jenkins  2005  as well as their strong rejection  Eskelinen 2001b .  With space as its vantage point, we have to approach cinematic expression  as closely connected to the creation of this virtual space. Cinematic visualiza- tion  is  seen  as  the  audiovisual  means  to  present  game  spaces  via  moving  images.  Thus,  parallels  between  games  and  ﬁ lm  primarily  are  meant  to  be  read  as  space-driven  necessities  and  not  as  cinema-infused  guidelines  for  games.  6.2  Architecture and the Moving Image  Film  and  architecture  have  interconnected  at  least  since  the  1920s,  when modernist architecture broke many of the frames established by tradi- tional  practices.  A  blurring  of  distinctions  between  inside  and  outside,  the opening of surfaces, and dynamic arrangements shifted the focus on the  visitor  and  the  exploration  of  the  space.  This  exploration  could  be  shaped  through sequencing, vistas, and movement, which in turn could be shaped by  the  architect.  Once  more,  movement  and  structuring  this  movement  stand  out in the design. Frank Lloyd Wright is only one example of this develop- ment.  It  was  Le  Corbusier  who  introduced  the  term  of  the  “architectural  promenade” and implemented it notably in his Villa Savoye  1929–1931 . “In  this  house  we  are  presented  with  a  real  architectural  promenade,  offering   Chapter 6  74   prospects which are constantly changing and unexpected, even astonishing”   Le  Corbusier  1991 .  The  promenade  is  rooted  in  landscape  architecture  and in the idea that it can create a tension between idealized spatial arrange- ments  and  the  sensations  they  trigger  as  one  navigates  through  them.  It  is  not  an  invention  of  the  twentieth  century  to  shape  a  structure  around  the  experience  of  the  visitor,  who  explores  it  through  movement.  Historically,  this has been part of many spaces designed around rituals, processions, and  performances.  The  Stations  of  the  Cross  in  a  Christian  church  present  a  pathway through the building that takes the visitor from one signiﬁ cant point  to the next in an exploration of the whole church building; landscape archi- tecture has implemented comparable concepts, for example in the design of  gardens where pathways open up new vistas and lead to new discoveries for  the visitor.  But  in  the  1920s  architecture  gained  a  new  media  to  reference  in  this  structuring  process:  cinema.  It  is  not  surprising  that  architects  like  Robert  Mallet-Stevens worked in ﬁ lm as well as in their original domain. So at the  same  time  that  Mallet  Stevens,  together  with  Auguste  Perret,  founded  the  architectural review Architecture d’aujourd’hui, three short ﬁ lms were produced  by  Pierre  Chenal  in  collaboration  with  Le  Corbusier.  The  purpose  of  these  ﬁ lms was not only to publicize their new forum but also to work as a form of  propaganda for modernist architecture. In return, architectural theorist Sig- fried Giedeon replied that “only ﬁ lm can make the new architecture intelli- gible”  Giedeon 1996 . Around the same time  1929  Mallet-Stevens’s own  architecture was captured on ﬁ lm by Man Ray in Les Mystères du Château de  Dès  Ray 1929 . Like in Chenal’s ﬁ lm, movement and energy dominate Ray’s  work: the camera swoops through buildings, focuses on speeding cars, travels  over facades, rushes through the building; the editing can even be distorting.  If a moving viewpoint was demanded by the new architecture, the ﬁ lm camera  was more than willing to provide it.  Expanding the cinematic from a building to a whole city, we see the birth  of the city symphonies in milestone pieces such as Ruttmann’s Berlin, Sym- phony of a Great City  Ruttmann 1927 . As Penz argues, “The city of the 1910s  and  1920s  is  quintessentially  ‘modern’  and  ﬁ lm-makers  were  keen  to  work  with  this  symbol  of  modernity.  Cities  are  perpetually  on  the  move,  things  happen fast, and the idea of capturing the speed of it all embodied the ideal  of the Futurist movement”  Thomas and Penz 2003, 144 . Other commercial  ﬁ lm productions presented and experimented with ideas for a city of the future  as  seen,  for  example,  in  Metropolis   Lang  1927 .  The  urban  structure  itself  comes  to  life  through  the  work  of  the  ﬁ lmmaker,  and  in  the  person  of  Ruttmann  we  ﬁ nd  another  architect-ﬁ lmmaker  combination.  The  Eameses’   Games as Moving Images  75   Powers of Ten  Eames and Eames 1977  takes this to the next level when its  camera travels from the human scale of a man sleeping in a park into the outer  universe looking upon the galaxy and back into the microscopic detail on the  man’s hand. It seemed cinema provided the right canvas for architects—like  Charles  and  Ray  Eames—to  operate  on  all  scales  and  visualize  them  in  some form.  The  moving  image  also  gained  prominence  as  a  tool  for  architectural  design.  The  digital  revolution  especially  led  to  new  production  and  design  techniques. Architects were able to generate walk- and ﬂ y-through planned  buildings to illustrate and test their spatial conﬁ gurations. Finally, adapting  video  games  to  their  design  process,  architects  were  able  to  provide  future  inhabitants a virtual promenade in the form of interactive exploration. In such  a virtual promenade the spatial control is given back to the visitor player but  the  image  remains  an  artiﬁ cial,  computer-generated  visualization  of  space   Richens and Trinder 1999; Shiratudding and Thabet 2002 . The most inter- esting step, though, happened when architects were inspired by these virtual  computer-generated spaces to leave the physical realm altogether.  From a technique to assist design and an aesthetic form of expression, the  moving  image  and  the  virtual  space  ﬁ nally  shifted  into  the  main  focus  for  some  architects.  Marcos  Novak’s  work  on  “liquid  architecture”  depends  on  computer-generated  space  that  lives  entirely  in  the  virtual  realm   1991,  1996b . As early as the mid-1990s, Novak  1995, 45  argued for such archi- tecture in cyberspace: “It would be an architecture designed as much in time  as in space, changing interactively as a function of duration, use, and external  inﬂ uence; it would be described in a compact, coded notation, allowing efﬁ - cient transmission; it would allow different renditions under disparate funda- mental  geometries;  and  it  would  be  designed  using  the  most  advanced  concepts, tools, and processes.”  This form of virtual architecture depends on the computer as its host and  can only be visited on the projection screen. It might have grown out of cin- ematic traditions, but once interactivity was added, it reached the world of  video games. One can argue that the digital revolution included a revolution  of the traditional cinema, but like Novak’s work, virtual game spaces are not  primarily  “reinventions”  of  traditional  cinema.  They  are  a  new  format  that  applies  cinematic  and  interactive  techniques  in  order  to  become  legible  to  visitors. Their origins grow from interactive access to these spaces and move- ment through them as a deﬁ ning access point. Therefore, video game spaces  are not descendents of cinema but of virtual navigable “otherworlds.” While  presentation  of  these  otherworlds  remains  heavily  inﬂ uenced  by  traditions   Chapter 6  76   established in cinema and television, their basis is in the interactive and navi- gable  nature  of  virtual  space.  As  the  next  paragraphs  will  illustrate,  these  otherworlds had to end up in the cultural ﬁ eld of the moving image, but they  enter it from a different direction.  6.3  Necessary Cinematic Mediation  Virtual environments do not have a “natural” point of view. Disciplines such  as architecture mainly work in reference to the human body and the naturally  given human point of view, addressing its position  e.g., the positioning of  windows  to  allow  views  outside  a  building ,  as  well  as  its  capabilities  and  limitations  e.g., using the viewing distance toward a ceiling painting . The  human body rightly serves as the physically present reference point. In con- trast,  interactors  are  not  physically  present  in  virtual  worlds  but  remain  in  the  play  space.  Consequently,  there  is  no  predeﬁ ned  viewing  position  in  a  virtual game world.  Cave Automatic Virtual Environments  CAVE  and head-mounted displays  replicate  such  a  body-centered  viewpoint.  In  them,  the  physical  body  of  the user remains included and is the point of reference for the virtual space.  But commercial game worlds do not provide such a cost-intensive interface  approach. Instead, they use a single screen that displays 2D projection planes  of the 3D game world. Each view into the game world has to be generated  by  positioning  a  virtual  camera  inside  the  virtual  environment.  As  will  be  outlined subsequently, virtual cameras are not the same as ﬁ lm cameras, but  the  moving  images  they  present  to  the  interactor  are  part  of  the  traditions  established  by  other  moving-image  media.  By  analogy,  these  viewpoints  refer to the established domain of ﬁ lm cameras. In that way, the cinematic  enters  the  video  game  not  as  an  extension  of  ﬁ lm  but  as  a  necessity  of  virtual space.  It is in the nature of a camera  virtual or real  to select, frame, and interpret.  Through  this  selection,  the  moving  image  infuses  the  virtual  world  with  a  perspective. It narrates the space to the player. Because every video game space  needs  a  camera,  there  can  be  no  3D  video  game  without  such  a  narrating.  Even if this camera strategy is limited to a single viewpoint throughout the  whole  user  experience—as  seen  in  the  ﬁ rst-person  shooting  genre—it  still  constitutes a particular perspective that uses a speciﬁ c expressive range and  features a genuine narrative force. It is here that the cinematic traditions come  into play, opening up a well-developed reservoir of references and traditions,  which have to be analyzed.  Games as Moving Images  77   Ultimately, the cinematic mediation of the virtual space and the events is  not neutral, but is an important factor that shapes the player’s relation to the  virtual world. The conscious visualization directs the interactor’s perception  of the game world and can attach speciﬁ c meanings to the elements within  the world it presents. It structures the virtual promenade in a cinematic way.  In other words, because there can be no video game space without the narra- tive dimension of the virtual camera, we must investigate the camera’s work  in these spaces.  Chapter 6  78   7  Cinema and Game Spaces  There  are  clear  differences  between  video  game  space  and  cinematic  space.  Both are accessed very differently: the linear description in ﬁ lm vs. the non- linear exploration in games. But, at the same time, the parallels between the  ﬁ ctional worlds created by video games and ﬁ lm are strong and were recog- nized early on  e.g., Nelson 1990 . The plane of the mediated space is part of  the interactive system in video games, but it quotes many visual traditions  from cinema. In order to keep the mediation legible, 3D games have lined  themselves up in the tradition of the moving image, and it is not surprising  that a remarkable amount of effort has gone into the use of cinematic visual- ization techniques in video games. This chapter will investigate these tech- niques based on the spatial approach already outlined.  7.1  Cinematic Space  Through the image “ﬁ lm makes space”  Heath 1976, 107 , and it does so in  various ways. Three approaches will be covered here: the spatial arrangements  in  the  image  itself;  the  way  the  camera  explores  the  pro-ﬁ lmic  space;  and  ﬁ nally, the role of editing. All three are interconnected but are separated here  to establish a short overview over cinematic space and allow a look at the use  of virtual cameras in games in the following section.  A single image can show only a fraction of a ﬁ lm’s event world at any one  time on the screen, and the audience has to add the missing parts and generate  context between the provided information. As Bordwell, Staiger, and Thomp- son  argue:  “The  viewer,  having  learned  distinct  perceptual  and  cognitive  activities,  meets  the  ﬁ lm  halfway  and  completes  the  illusion  of  seeing  an    integral  ﬁ ctional  piece”   1985,  59 .  While  watching  the  ﬁ lm  the  audience  imagines and slowly builds a ﬁ ctional space that grows from a comprehension  of many different shots. Hochberg compares this cinematic space creation and  its edited results to the generation of cognitive maps: “The task of the ﬁ lm- maker therefore is to make the viewer pose a visual question, and then answer  it for him”  Hochberg in Bordwell, Staiger, and Thompson 1985, 59 .  Within the single image the space can be ambiguous, ﬂ at, or deep  e.g.,  Block 2001 . The difference between these three stages depends on the number  of visual cues to support spatial representation. There are a range of such visual  cues available in an image to “make space.” Arnheim suggested balance, shape,  form,  growth,  space,  light,  color,  movement,  tension,  and  expression   see  Monaco 2000, 183 .  Ambiguous space is barely legible and lacks most cues that would allow for  a  coherent  contextualization  of  the  depicted  environment.  For  example,  an  extreme closeup of an object can distort the audience’s spatial perception of  the relative position and orientation of this object on the ﬁ lm set.  Flat space focuses on the two-dimensional quality of the projected image  itself.  It  lacks  most  depth  cues  and  visual  cues  point  back  to  the  same  3D  plane. The picture does not provide differences in size or perspective direc- tions, or other visible parallax effects. It can also ﬂ atten out color differences  or  shadows  to  balance  the  composition  further.  For  example,  the  sideway  perspectives of Muybridge’s famous motion studies use ﬂ at spaces. This con- centration on the 2D surface has parallels to painting but there is a funda- mental  difference  in  the  quality  of  the  surface  in  painting,  ﬁ lm,  and  video  games. Paintings reﬂ ect light and thereby call attention to their surface struc- ture. They can use the surface as an important part of their expressive means  when the thickness of brush strokes emphasizes the materiality of the paint- ing. In contrast, the cinema screen is a neutral reﬂ ection zone with much less  character to itself. Mast argues, “the screen seems more to absorb the images   like a sponge  than to refract and bounce them, although such a refraction is  literally  what  we  see   but  not  perceive ”   1977,  141 .  TV  and  computer  screens,  on  the  other  hand,  emit  light.  Those  “windows”  into  other  worlds  seem  to  barely  contain  the  images  within  them.  The  argument  comes  full  circle when Manovich points back to digital ﬁ lm as basically a form of paint- ing  and  animation  because  it  allows  the  direct  manipulation  of  the  image   2001, 295 . This emphasizes the picture-plane qualities of game devices that  can inﬂ uence even game interfaces like the touch-screen of the Nintendo DS,  for example.  In  by  far  the  most  cases,  the  2D  picture  of  the  projection  is  read  as  the  presentation of a 3D space through the use of perspective and motion—this   Chapter 7  80   creates the deep space effect. The result is a depth of ﬁ eld in the picture that  can be utilized by the director camera operator to open up different layers of  action within the space of a single image, then traverse and explore them. The  image itself gains a deep focus.  This approach ﬁ nds a prominent cinematic peak in Welles’s seminal ﬁ lm  Citizen  Kane   1941 .  Welles  created  multilayered  spatial  compositions  and  moved actors and cameras through them, thereby providing rich spatial depth  through an elaborate mise-en-scène and camera movement. Unlike montage,  which lets the audience reassemble the space from different images and their  relation to each other, deep focus presents space as extending into the single  image. Neorealist cinema, for example, adopted the technique because it was  considered to provide a “larger” picture of the “real” pro-ﬁ lmic space. Con- sidering the importance of the creation of space in ﬁ lms, it is not surprising  that  the  element  of  deep  focus  served  as  a  cornerstone  for  Bazin’s  approach  toward cinema.  Ambiguous, ﬂ at, and deep space categorize the number and work of visible  spatial cues within the given image. Another approach looks at the relation- ship between the framed image and the off-screen spaces. Burch distinguishes  between six types of off-screen spaces: above the visible image; under it; to  the left of it; to the right of it; the space behind the visible set; and the space  behind the camera  1981 . Although the space of a single image is restricted  by  the  on-screen  information,  it  can  refer  to  these  spaces  beyond  its  given  framing. The image can be framed in such a way as to raise awareness of the  world beyond the given image—its framing can be open or closed  following  Monaco 2000, 185 . The open form features visual cues that point to a world  outside the frame. Just like the depth of ﬁ eld pointed into the space of the  image, the open framing raises awareness of a world outside the single image.  Movement  cues,  color  arrangement,  perspective  lines,  and  any  other  signal  that  points  beyond  the  framed  image  space  to  imply  a  world  beyond  its  boundaries—all work for the open form. For example, a car passing through  the image from left to right points to the relevance of some space outside the  framed  borders,  and  a  hand  reaching  into  the  image  from  above  or  below  points to the presence of a character in these off-screen areas. The latter is a  widespread visual tradition in ﬁ rst-person shooter games where the hand of  the player-controlled hero often reaches into the screen from below, indicating  the  presence  of  the  hero  character  in  that  case.  A  closed  form  lacks  these  pointers  and  instead  concentrates  the  attention  to  the  depicted  world  as  a  complete arrangement.  It  is  in  the  combination  of  dynamic  framing  and  orchestration  of  image  space  that  the  cinematic  image  gains  its  strongest  spatial  dynamics.  Visual   Cinema and Game Spaces  81   cues combine with motion to give birth to the spatiotemporal quality of the  scene. This can be traced in descriptions of early movie audiences. The painter  Maxim Gorky, for example, recalled a visit to the Lumières’ salon in the ﬁ rst  days  of  cinema:  “When  the  lights  go  out  in  the  room  in  which  Lumière’s  invention is shown, there suddenly appears a large grey picture, ‘A Street in  Paris’—shadows  of  a  bad  engraving.  As  you  gaze  at  it,  you  see  carriages,  buildings and people in various poses, all frozen into immobility. All this in  grey, and the sky above is also grey—you anticipate nothing new in this all  too familiar scene, for you have seen pictures of Paris streets more than once.  But suddenly a strange ﬂ icker passes through the scene and the picture springs  to life”  see Cubitt 2005, 14–15 .  The virtual Paris comes to life only through the element of motion. Within  this space in motion, the event unfolds. Spatial understanding can be so domi- nant that it becomes a necessary element to support an audience’s understand- ing of the action. That is why Branigan argues that “narrative in ﬁ lm rests on  our ability to create a three-dimensional world out of a two-dimensional wash  of light and dark”  1992, 33 . Paris “springs to life” out of the limited frame  of the still image and into a movement-action space. This means that we have  to add the camera to the space-making forces. Thanks to the camera’s  and  projector’s  technical performance, the motion can enter the picture.  Principally,  the  camera  work  during  the  recording  of  a  ﬁ lm  depends  on  two main elements: the position of the camera, including its movements and  orientation, and the technical operation of elements working in the camera  apparatus during the recording. The position of any camera aligns itself along  the three axes that deﬁ ne the camera’s angle and its position in Euclidian space.  Camera movements  dollying, craning, and tilting  are possible along any of  these axes and can be combined with each other in numerous ways  for practical  discussion of the effects, see, e.g., Katz 1991, 1992 or Zettl 2004 . At any given  position, a camera can also change its angle toward each of the axes by tilting,  panning, or rolling. A number of devices are used to control these movements  on a physical camera, each with its own abilities and limitations: a dolly, crane,  steady-cam, or simple tripod allow different levels of movement.  The mobile camera has made an important contribution to the develop- ment of the cinematic language. It was, for example, the technological basis  for Vertov’s “kino-eye” and became part of the image and ﬁ lm theme itself in  his Chelovek s Kinoapparatom  Man with a Movie Camera   Vertov 1929 . Cine- matographers  like  Burel,  Kruger,  Mundwiller,  and  Torpkoff  in  Gance’s  Napoléon  1927  and Baberske and Freund in Murnau’s Der letzte Mann  The  Last  Laugh    Murnau  1929   experimented  with  the  freedom  of  the  mobile  camera. These masterpieces would not have succeeded in creating their unique   Chapter 7  82   Figure 7.1  Types of possible camera movements  sequences  without  the  mobile  camera.  Here,  dynamic  movements  of  the  camera are used to dramatize the events and the spaces in which the actions  unfold.  Audiences  follow  the  gradual  unfolding  of  the  city  in  Ruttmann’s  Berlin, Symphony of a Great City and can catch glimpses of tactical brilliance  of a young Napoleon during a children’s snowball ﬁ ght in Gance’s Napoléon, or the fragmenting movements of people, objects, and lights in the hotel in  Murnau’s The Last Laugh. Movement deﬁ nes the role of the camera as both  spatial and a spatializing entity.  In addition to its spatial positioning, functional elements within or attached  to the camera apparatus and its optics shape the ﬁ nal picture. These include,  for  example,  various  lenses   enabling  zooms  and  change  of  focus ,  different  ﬁ lters   changing  the  color  range  or  adding  visual  effects ,  variable  shutter  speed   deﬁ ning  the  rate  and  light  intensity  of  the  recording ,  and  different  ﬁ lm stock  offering variety of grain, color range, light sensitivity . Depending  on their function, different cameras may offer special features that adjust for  particular  needs,  for  example  in  the  form  of  high-speed  cameras,  extremely  light-sensitive lenses, or steady-cam setups. While these effects mainly affect  the shot image itself, they can still support the creation of deep space. Pulling  the  focus  from  an  object  in  the  foreground  to  one  in  the  background  is  a   Cinema and Game Spaces  83   widespread example. Once again, the biggest impact grows from a combina- tion of mobile camera and camera apparatus. Hitchcock demonstrates this in  the  ﬁ lm  Vertigo,  through  his  visualization  of  the  vertigo  effect   1958 .  To  simulate this effect in a cinematically visual way, he moved the camera while  zooming in the opposite direction. Through this combination he was able to  create a stunning visual interpretation based on spatial variation. The shown  space seems to expand and shrink at the same time and thus becomes unstable  and insecure for the audience.  The technical features of the camera changed over time and this develop- ment directly affected cinematic traditions and resulting cinematic styles— and  consequently  spaces.  For  example,  the  matter  of  the  camera’s  mobility  deﬁ ned production methods and artistic directions. When Éclair introduced  their Éclair NPR  for Noiseless Portable Reﬂ ex  16 mm camera in 1963, the  new  technology  ﬁ nally  provided  professional  image  quality  for  handheld  camera work with live sound recording—both elements that deﬁ ned the new  movement of cinema verité and its speciﬁ c form of presentation. Nine years  later, the Arriﬂ ex 35-BL and Panavision’s Panaﬂ ex provided the same revolu- tionary  development  of  a  handheld  near-noiseless  camera  for  the  35 mm  format.  The  mid-1990s  saw  the  release  of  affordable  prosumer  digital  ideo  cameras like the Sony PD 100 and the Canon XL1. They signiﬁ cantly reduced  production costs and suited the production style of the Dogme 95 movement  as  they  allowed  for  the  direct  and  immediate  recording  philosophy  of  the  Dogme artisans.  On the other end of the spectrum, Hollywood uses digital cameras not only  in  ﬁ lm  productions  since  Star  Wars:  Episode  II—Attack  of  the  Clones   Lucas  2002 , for which speciﬁ c high-end cameras were developed, but also in televi- sion productions. A combination of an extremely mobile camera with a range  of  zoom  effects,  constant  focus  pulling,  and  reframing  remediates  cinema  verité  style  in  the  TV  camera  work  of  television  series  such  as  NYPD  Blue  Bochco  and  Milch  1993–2005 ,  or  the  new  television  serial  version  of  Battlestar Galactica  Larson 2004– . Both are shot in high-deﬁ nition television   HDTV   with  digital  cameras.  Ultimately,  the  evolution  of  the  camera  has  constantly left an imprint on the art of the moving image and the quality of  the space it produces. The same applies to video games and their generation  of game spaces.  7.2  Cinematic Image Space in Video Games  If a ﬁ lm audience were to step through the camera and onto the ﬁ lm set they  would  see  a  modern  ﬁ lm  studio.  The  diegetic  ﬁ lm  world  would  be  decon-  Chapter 7  84   structed  as  the  production  studio  replaces  the  ﬁ ctional  world.  Instead  of  a  ceiling there might be a battery of lights; where one would expect the fourth  wall, there would be cameras, sound equipment, and a number of technicians  working to produce the illusion. This space is not the world of the story but  that of the production of the ﬁ lm. The illusion created by the ﬁ ctional world  would be broken.  In contrast, it is a deﬁ ning characteristic of video game spaces that they  allow  this  step  into  the  represented  space.  The  result  is  a  hybrid  between  architectural navigable and cinematically represented space. On the one hand,  the game space is presented by the camera not unlike in ﬁ lm. As the audience  steps through the screen into the world behind, they take the camera with  them and enter a continuous navigable diegetic world like a never ending ﬁ lm  set. The camera remains a narrative device. As Bolter suggests, “We under- stand and appreciate Myst precisely because we know what happens in detec- tive ﬁ lms”  1997, 4; italics in original .  On the other hand, this virtual world is not the slave of the image. Players  are  free  to  explore  and  interact  with  it  directly.  Interactors  might  enter  an  expressive cinematic space, but now they can act in it. The necessary eye of  the  virtual  camera  makes  these  spaces  cinematic  and  the  interaction  makes  them  accessible  much  like  architectural  structures.  The  player  experiences  game spaces in a combination of both, continuous navigable space and cine- matic space. Such a combination has far-ranging consequences for video game  worlds.  It  deﬁ nes  two  fundamental  frameworks,  architecture  and  ﬁ lm,  that  help us understand 3D games better.  This connection of cinematic tradition and spatial use and understanding  can be applied in video games. Some years ago, I was the designer for a research  project at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe’s Cambridge studios, titled  Common Tales. The goal was to experiment with cinematic storytelling tech- niques in a game prototype. In one of these tests we developed a sequence set  in a small underground maze. The main task here was to use the connection  between cinematic presentation and player navigation. We wanted to improve  the  maze-like  quality  of  the  sequence  not  by  changing  the  geometry  but  through the camera work. In order to complicate the orientation and make  the  limited  size  of  the  virtual  space  appear  larger,  camera  positions  were  arranged in such a way as to complicate a straightforward comprehension. By  deliberately breaking traditions of cinematic presentation, the visualization of  the maze creates a disorientating effect that inﬂ uences the perception of space  in  it.  Because  the  cinematic  mediation  does  not  follow  the  expected  estab- lished cinematic techniques, the feeling of “getting lost” is intensiﬁ ed in the  interactor’s experience of the maze. This complicates the interactor’s task of   Cinema and Game Spaces  85   Figure 7.2 Common Tales: the spatial structure of the underground level  left ; the structure  with the implemented paths, nodes, and trigger zones  right   mastering the maze and dramatizes the exploration. Such an effect is variable  and can be used to support the dramatic means. In the case of Common Tales, once the dramatic situation is resolved and the interactor has found the exit,  the camera work changes to a following camera that allows for easier explora- tion  of  the  maze  during  a  possible  revisit.  The  virtual  stage  remains  the  same—the representation of the space changes dramatically and so does the  player’s experience of the space.  A comparable effect can be achieved by repeating the same camera perspec- tive to a similar-looking place again and again or reducing the spatial represen- tation to a repetitive design. When we lack necessary visual and spatial cues, the  game  world  can  become  ambiguous.  The  dungeons  of  Castle  Wolfenstein 3D appear to us to be too repetitive today, as we have grown used to far more elabo- rate,  detailed,  and  diverse  virtual  spaces   e.g.,  in  its  sequel  Return  to  Castle  Wolfenstein [Markham and Sherman 2001] . Today players are looking for much  more and more subtle visual cues and the bare representational bones of those  early 3D pioneers can seem like ﬂ at spaces because of their visual limitations.  Thanks to this higher visual quality, the virtual camera can also work as a  guide.  I  can  depict  any  detail  of  a  space  as  an  important  element  through  framing, closeups, or focus-pulling and direct attention to it. Prince of Persia:  The Sands of Time  Mechner 2003  is an elaborate 3D sequel to the original  2D title. Both games focus on spectacular spatial exploration of the virtual  stage combined with action and puzzle elements. Both feature a strong and  athletic hero presented through smooth avatar movements. The focus on the  animation  that  had  already  been  part  of  the  original  2D  Prince  of  Persia  Chapter 7  86   Figure 7.3 Prince of Persia:  the  prince  has  fallen  into  a  trap   left ; Prince of Persia: The  Sands of Time: the prince escapes from a trap  right    Mechner 1989  was clearly adapted in the sequel. In both games, the player- avatar of the Prince has a wide variety of animations for spatial exploration  and ﬁ ghting. But the presentation of the video game spaces is fundamentally  different and faces different challenges.  The original 2D Prince of Persia features a single camera in a typical side  perspective  used  in  many  2D  jump-and-run  titles.  Its  sequel  has  to  show  the—at times extremely complicated—routes through the level in 3D. The  choice  of  camera  perspective  is  crucial  in  planning  one’s  route  through  the  game world; it is important in enemy encounters and during the solution of  spatial puzzles, and it is relevant to the timing and direction of most move- ments in the game world.  The player of the sequel has to read the depth of the virtual space and form  a strategy to avoid its obstacles. The space is neither ambiguous nor ﬂ at, but  navigating  its  depth  becomes  an  important  element  of  the  gameplay.  To  support orientation, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time offers elaborate camera  work. One feature is a ﬂ y-through at the beginning of any complicated level  that indicates the route to master it. The game offers a “scenic” view, a pre- deﬁ ned  static  viewpoint  to  the  level  at  hand  that  is  set  up  to  optimize  the  comprehension of the necessary features. Such a view cannot be complete and  always excludes certain elements but it is further proof of the virtual camera  directing  attention  and  working  as  a  narrative  ﬁ lter.  The  camera  work  can  also present visual questions. If a certain location might not be immediately  visible, this can indicate a possible hidden extra. Thus, to make the most of  the game world in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, the player not only has  to master the navigable game space, but also to decipher the quirks and cin- ematic traditions of its presentation. The ﬂ y-through and the scenic view focus   Cinema and Game Spaces  87   the  player’s  attention  on  the  relevant  elements  within  the  level.  A  piece  of  furniture  that  would  have  been  disregarded  can  be  introduced  through  the  focus of the camera as the hidden exit to the next level; a ﬂ agpole that might  have gone unnoticed is brought to attention and with it a whole new passage  through the 3D structure.  Another example for the use of visual depth is a reappearing image com- position in the Metal Gear Solid series. A dominating camera perspective in  this series is a detached view overlooking the action. But the camera moves  down  to  eye  height  and  behind  the  main  hero  whenever  the  player-avatar  hides behind a wall. The shot quotes a cinematic tradition from thriller and  action movies that use the depth of the composition to juxtapose the player- avatar in the foreground and the target moving on a level deeper in the picture.  Such a use of different depth layers can support different expressive meanings.  Harpole  points  toward  the  notion  of  suspense  that  can  be  evoked  by  “the  placement of a hidden killer in the foreground while his victim innocently  washes dishes in the background”  1978, 243 . Metal Gear Solid quotes such  an effect: the player-avatar is the highly skilled character hiding in the fore- ground  to  avoid  the  unaware  guards  and  succeed  in  his  stealth  mission.  Suspense ultimately depends on an unequal distribution of information about  a dramatic event. Here, the camera work implies such suspense as it supports  and visually realizes tension between the differing depth layers that quite liter- ally  represent  different  levels  of  knowledge.  The  player  in  the  foreground  knows more about the danger of the situation than the possible victim in the  back.  At  the  same  time,  the  player’s  view  is  also  restricted  in  comparison  to  the  dominating,  down-looking  camera.  This  down-looking  view  offers  a  wider overview compared to the “sneaking” camera. Thus, suspense is evoked  visually in two ways.  The view is an important visual representation of the stealth setting of the  Metal Gear Solid series, and is an important feature of the stealth gameplay as  well as a visual exclamation mark of the series.  Again, visual details can become part of the gameplay mechanics over the  development of the series. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty  Kojima 2002   includes,  for  example,  shadows  that  could  be  spotted  by  the  player  or  the  enemy to locate a character. The third series installment puts emphasis on the  texturing and the player has to select from a number of possible camouﬂ age  outﬁ ts to improve the hero’s stealth abilities. Such a level of detail is clearly  missing in the ﬁ rst 3D installment of the series.  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time refers to the adventure and swashbuckling  genres that position the hero in a strange otherworld, not to hide its wonders  but to make them accessible, navigable, and open for conquest. Consequently,   Chapter 7  88   Figure  7.4 Metal Gear Solid   left ; Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty   center ; Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater  right —the hero hides in the foreground  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time prefers a wider view. If we see Bruce Willis  in Die Hard  McTiernan 1988  sneaking through the hallways of a skyscraper- turned-destruction-ground or Solid Snake inﬁ ltrating a military base in Metal Gear Solid, we read them as examples of suspense via depth. We can contrast  this with Burt Lancaster in The Crimson Pirate  Siodmak 1952  or Errol Flynn  in The Adventures of Robin Hood  Curtiz and Keighley 1938  as classic repre- sentations of the  male  body’s conquering of space more openly—swashbuck- ling instead of sneaking. Traditions of image spaces seem to transcend from  ﬁ lm to video game and bring with them a range of cultural connotations.  Many commercial modern computer games that want to evoke the mood  and style of an established cinematic genre remediate and recreate their spe- ciﬁ c visual strategies in-game. These effects include slow motion  Max Payne , instant  replays   EA’s  Madden  series ,  action-dependent  camera  movements   Metal Gear Solid , or ﬁ xed stylized views of the virtual space  Biohazard [aka  Resident  Evil   Kamiya  et  al.  1996 ],  hereafter  referred  to  as  Resident  Evil , among others. This growth of game spaces through cinematic referencing is  by no means complete. Many references depend on technical restrictions and  only  become  gradually  available.  For  example,  backlighting  is  a  traditional  technique to distinguish the character from its surroundings in ﬁ lm. In games,  such a basic option of visual arrangement only became recently available with  dynamic lighting and high-polygon characters.  Like  their  physical  counterparts,  virtual  cameras  improve  over  time  and  develop new options. Because these options directly affect the game space they  need further and more detailed investigation.  The  continuous  cross-referencing  between  ﬁ lm  and  video  game  has  blurred  some borderlines. Films inspire the computer game industry, leading to many   7.3  Virtual Cameras  Cinema and Game Spaces  89   titles quoting or referring to ﬁ lm content and design. At the same time, video  game production methods as well as aesthetics inﬂ uence ﬁ lm and television.  Video  games  are  used  during  the  previsualization  of  ﬁ lm  productions  like Spielberg’s Artiﬁ cial Intelligence: AI  Spielberg 2001; Lehane 2001 , they  create  movie  spin-offs,  like  Lara  Croft:  Tomb  Raider   West  2001   and  Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within  Sakaguchi and Skakibara 2001 , and they  inﬂ uence the aesthetic as well as the content of ﬁ lms like Tron  Lisberger 1982   or The Matrix  Wachowski and Wachowski 1999 . A ﬁ lm-related video game  such as Enter the Matrix  Wachowski et al. 2003  can even include the direc- tors of the underlying movie The Matrix Reloaded  Wachowski and Wachowski  2003  as cocreators. Enter the Matrix quotes content, setting, style, and visu- alization techniques as well as features story elements and characters from the  referred  movie,  and  was  released  parallel  to  the  movie  as  a  shared  media  event.  It can be tempting to simply accept a somehow growing mix of camera  work between the different media formats of ﬁ lm and video game, but virtual  camera  implementation  has  to  take  the  speciﬁ cs  of  interactive  game  spaces  into account. Often, the virtual camera is not the single ﬁ xed viewpoint to an  event but one option among a range of different perspectives. It has to cater  to and support interactive access to the game world and thus differs from the  single guiding eye of the physical camera. To understand its operation, it is  necessary to highlight the low-level parallels and differences relative to estab- lished camera work.  Technically, a virtual camera is a 2D projection plane, not a spatial entity  in the game space  e.g., Thomas and Haussmann 2005 . Thanks to this imma- teriality, a virtual camera does not depend on any physical mechanism other  than the computer hardware it runs on. For example, the use of linear perspec- tive  is  optional  in  a  virtual  camera  and  the  projection  plane  itself  can  be  reshaped and distorted. A virtual camera is a mathematical entity, not a physi- cal one; it does not record the light emitted or reﬂ ected by a certain event,  but rather creates a projection of an imagined viewpoint on the monitor. It  modiﬁ es  a  light  source  instead  of  recording  an  existing  one.  All  this  raises  questions about the terminology.  The term “virtual camera” will be used here as a cultural reference. As we  have seen, the camera is a creative force in the generation of a spatial experi- ence and a form of narrating ﬁ lter. The following paragraphs will concentrate  on the resulting mediated plane. In other words, the argument does not cover  rendering algorithms but the results of these rendering processes. These are  the digitally generated real-time moving images that are not approached as  technical pixel masses but as pictures.  Chapter 7  90   In order to shape this camera work, virtual cameras can mimic all of the  mentioned real-camera behaviors in their presentation of a video game space  without any physical restraints. Paradoxically, this freedom of digital cameras  can initially result in a shrinking of applied artistic practice. A virtual camera  lacks the functional parts of a real camera apparatus that codeﬁ ne cinematic  language. There are no lenses, ﬁ lters, shutters, no iris, or ﬁ lm stock in a virtual  camera; the camera does not weigh anything and does not make any noise— yet all these elements are responsible for a range of cinematic effects and the  development  of  cinema’s  form.  Without  these  deﬁ ning  features,  virtual  cameras  lack  an  important  incentive  for  artistic  development:  the  creative  encounter with the limitations of the technology. Modern game titles often  try to bridge such an estranging difference caused by perfect pixilation and  thereby  are  living  proof  for  Bolter  and  Grusin’s  theory  of  “remediation”   Bolter and Grusin 1999 . Virtual cameras can incorporate ﬁ lmic effects such  as lens ﬂ are although they do not use any physical lenses that are the technical  reason for such an effect. They can present the image in the grainy resolution  of low-quality video pictures  see, e.g., the video communicator in Metal Gear  Solid  although they can render pixel-sharp. Other titles might add artiﬁ cial  cracks and scratches like those that result from the handling of the physical  ﬁ lm  material   see,  e.g.,  Fatal  Frame  II:  Crimson  Butterﬂ y  [Shibata  2003]   or  change  from  black  and  white  to  full  color   see,  e.g.,  Viewtiful  Joe  [Kamiya  2003] .  Viewtiful  Joe  also  applies  a  special  rendering  algorithm—a  so-called  2D  shader—that  renders  a  3D  world  in  a  2D  fashion  and  provides  the  game’s  cartoon  style.  We  can  ﬁ nd  the  same  effect  in  titles  such  as  Jet  Grind  Radio  aka Jet Set Radio [Kikuchi 2000] , where it cites the aesthetics of grafﬁ ti art,  or in XIII  Barès 2003 , where it refers to comic traditions. Through this kind  of specialized software, video games can recreate a speciﬁ c cinematic camera  effect  or  style.  The  production  method  is  different  but  the  resulting  visual  effect remains intact.  Through this process of camera remediation, the paradox of the shrinking  artistic range is reversed. The mathematical creation of pseudophysical camera  effects makes these effects freely available to virtual cameras independent from  any  physical  setting.  From  the  perspective  of  cinema,  the  visualization  and  camera work in a video game is one long, dynamic special effect. The render- ing program that simulates a camera in virtual space can change the recording  speed,  add  distortion,  or  toggle  a  lens-ﬂ are  effect  independently  from  any  physical  setup,  during  a  single  take  in  real-time.  Effectively,  this  enables  virtual  cameras  to  deliver  more  camera  effects  than  a  real  ﬁ lm  camera  ever  could. Creating the bullet-time effect in The Matrix or Lost in Space  Hopkins   Cinema and Game Spaces  91   1998   depended  on  a  complicated  technical  setup  of  still  cameras  and  was  therefore limited to a certain stage setup. The resulting shots were impressive  visual peaks of the ﬁ lm. In contrast, the almost identical bullet-time effect in  Max Payne is an ever-present option at any location and moment. The excep- tion has turned into a permanently available option due to the different nature  of the rendering technique and the continuous and repetitive gameplay. While  Neo, the hero of The Matrix, discovers his abilities almost by chance and only  at the end of the ﬁ lm, the player in Max Payne gets access to the bullet-time  effect in the ﬁ rst section of the game. The special visual and functional rela- tion  between  Neo  and  the  space  of  The  Matrix  is  a  given  normality  in  the  game world of Max Payne.  If virtual cameras provide for such a wide ﬁ eld of expressive means, why  is it, then, that the camera work of most interactive titles rarely lives up to  the visual language of their cinematic references? To trace a brief history and  development of the camera work in video games, this argument will look at  the de facto use of the virtual camera in video games.  7.4  Use of Virtual Cameras in Video Game Spaces to Date  Researchers at various institutions looked into the use of cinematic styles for  virtual camera control and developed different principles to deﬁ ne cinematic  camera work in virtual worlds. Approaches build up higher levels “from a set  of primitive functions”  Drucker, Galyean, and Zeltzer 1992, 69 , establish  autonomous “Camera Agents”  Drucker 1994 , camera modules  He, Cohen,  and  Salesin  1996   that  can  be  rearranged  in  visually  engaging  ways,  and  “Camera  Creatures”   Tomlinson  1999   that  evoke  an  emotion-driven  visual  style   see  also  Tomlinson,  Blumberg,  and  Nain  2000 .  Others  focus  on  an  automated  adjustment  of  camera  behavior  to  certain  architectural  design   Calderon,  Worley,  and  Nyman  2006   or  specialize  on  a  use  of  established  camera  traditions  stored  in  an  extendable  database  for  faster  Machinima  production  Elson and Riedl 2007 .  The resulting virtual cameras can recreate a known visual style. For example,  they might quote Warner Brother’s cartoons as in SWAMPED     Johnson et  al.  1999 ,  TV-like  coverage  of  football  matches   Drucker  1994   or  other  established visual traditions  Elson and Riedl 2007 . Research in this area is  without doubt important to drive further development, but true to the focus  on  consumer-level  game  worlds,  the  following  chapter  will  start  from  the  available  cameras  in  video  games  to  extract  a  basic  matrix  of  video  game  camera traditions.  Chapter 7  92   A fundamental reason cameras in games are limited in their performance  is that the forms of presentation of video game spaces have to support their  functionality. Unlike traditional ﬁ lm, which tells a predeﬁ ned story without  interactive access to the content, cameras in video games deliver the cinematic  mediation of events as they are instantiated by the interactor in the virtual  world. Film cameras do not have to cater to any possible changes of the unfold- ing  events—virtual  cameras  do.  Because  they  have  to  guarantee  optimal  interactive access to the player, many video games rely on very basic camera  work—so narrow in scope, in fact, that some of them apply only one point of  view during the interactive experience. The genre of the ﬁ rst-person shooter  game derived its name from such a camera limitation. Yet, there is a develop- ment  toward  a  more  complex  representation  of  virtual  space  via  cinematic  means  in  modern  3D  video  games—even  for  ﬁ rst-person  shooters.  The  new  complexity  evolves  from  basic  camera  work  that  has  been  accepted  as  game-speciﬁ c visual tradition. It is an ongoing process, and before the new  complexity can be discussed, a look at these traditions is necessary.  Most  camera  views  in  video  games  have  to  be  optimized  for  the  player’s  interactive  access.  Because  this  access  includes  movement  through  space, the mobile camera that somehow explores the virtual set is a dominat- ing  form  in  3D  games.  Often,  the  user-avatar  operates  as  a  main  point  of  visual interest within the game space and the camera work has to refer to this  avatar and establish its position and orientation within the ﬁ ctional 3D world.  To  fulﬁ ll  this  task,  these  virtual  cameras  have  to  readjust  themselves  con- stantly  because  their  focus  point  is  shifting  constantly.  In  order  to  avoid  too  complex  camera  work  that  might  threaten  the  interactive  access,  many  commercial  video  games  limit  their  camera  work  to  four  dominant  camera  behaviors:   cid:2   a following camera  and related views such as over-the-shoulder cameras — third-person point of view behind the main user-avatar, found, e.g., in explo- ration adventure games such as Tomb Raider  Gard et al. 1996 ;  cid:2   an overhead view on the virtual world  and related views such as isometric  style —often  incorporating  varying  viewing  angles,  found,  e.g.,  in  strategy  games such as Age of Mythology  Fischer 2002 ;  cid:2   a  ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view—view  of  a  character  inside  the  virtual  world,  found, e.g., in ﬁ rst-person shooting games such as Quake; and   cid:2   predeﬁ ned viewing frames  ﬁ xed or moving —cameras with predeﬁ ned behav- ior in relation to the performance at speciﬁ c virtual locations, found, e.g., in  survival horror games such as the original Resident Evil.  Cinema and Game Spaces  93   Another option is the “free camera” that allows for continuous ﬂ y-through  of  virtual  spaces  and  exploration  from  any  perspective   found,  e.g.,  in  the  real-time strategy title Ground Control . These views exemplify the freedom of  virtual cameras but—so far—are either separated from the main play event  or lack relevance for the functionality  as will be exempliﬁ ed in Ground Control as follows .  The four outlined main camera strategies represent only a marginal part of  the  freedom  available  for  game  cameras,  but  in  practice  they  form  a  basic  visual tradition that can be traced in many video games. A comparable limita- tion of point of view can be found in the early years of cinema, when ﬁ lms  were one-reelers consisting of a single-take shot from a static camera position  that often remediated the view of a theater audience looking at the proscenium  stage. Many of Melies’s early one-reelers apply such a rudimentary point of  view. From such an early form, cinema grew up and invented its expressive  vocabulary through a collaboration of artistic and technological developments.  A  comparable  process  of  style  development  and  growth  of  expressive  range  via technical and artistic advancements can be found in the depiction of video  game  spaces.  The  development  of  elaborate  visualization  strategies  is  con- nected to these graphical improvements in games. Early virtual environments  had severe difﬁ culties in presenting a ﬁ ne-tuned readable space. For example,  in  tests  conducted  in  early  VR  pieces,  Henry  found  that  users  consistently  underestimated  distances  between  virtual  structures  by  20  percent   1992 .  Back in the early 1990s, Henry suggested that technical improvements of the  visual presentation and higher graphical detail might address this problem— and they did. Any experienced Counter-Strike player is capable of estimating  distances  and  positions.  The  ability  is  crucial  to  play  and  succeed  in  many  modern 3D action games. It is, for example, vital for 3D jump-and-run titles  for players to read distances between gaps accurately. The improvements of  graphical  presentation  and  the  richer  image  space  allow  for  a  better,  more  detailed reading of the game space. They also gave birth to more elaborate  camera work within these worlds.  Another reason for the development of more complex camera work is the  growing  familiarity  of  players  with  virtual  worlds.  Navigating  inside  the  virtual  worlds  itself  was  new,  unknown,  and  problematic,  and  often  led  to  simpliﬁ ed camera work. For example, Satalich argued for early VR worlds that  the unfamiliarity of interactors with virtual spaces was an important reason  why they had problems orientating themselves in these worlds  1995 . Cyber- space enthusiasts tended to demand a consistent ﬁ rst-person point of view to  deliver a perspective somewhat like real life  e.g., Laurel 1986 . But from the  limitations of relatively few worlds inside high-tech labs, game spaces spread   Chapter 7  94   into  our  living  rooms.  They  taught  generations  of  gamers  how  to  read  3D  spaces.  Players  developed  a  much  higher  level  of  literacy  of  game  worlds.  Today, virtual spaces are used to teach students map reading  e.g., the Way- farer  project  by  Ian  Raynes  [2003]   and  to  prepare  soldiers  for  specialized  missions  Macedonia 2002 . As in ﬁ lm, the expressive means of video game  space visualization are explored gradually and gradually accepted by the audi- ence. With a growth of both literacy and technical range the camera work can  develop further.  7.5  Development of Virtual Cameras in Games  If modern 3D video games have improved their expressive qualities, then we  should be able to trace a development from the basic visual building blocks  toward more elaborate camera work.  A  player  of  Prince  of  Persia:  The  Sands  of  Time  can  activate  a  ﬁ rst-person  point of view to orient  but not interact , can switch to a predeﬁ ned “scenic”  view to get a spatial overview, stick to the default interactive following camera  that  circles  around  the  avatar,  and  can  switch  to  a  slightly  different  view  during the game’s ﬁ ghts. In addition, and depending on the system used to  play Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, more camera positions can be mapped  to buttons and called when needed. Furthermore, the camera does not always  remain under player control during gameplay but might jump to a default  position for a given interactive situation. For example, certain locations enforce  predeﬁ ned viewpoints that support navigation through a speciﬁ c passage. In  addition, the game features a range of cutscenes, which include so-called event  cameras that dramatize the appearance of enemy encounters or spatial puzzles,  the solution of a speciﬁ c challenge, and special ﬁ ghting moves. Other cutscenes  include  introductory  ﬂ y-throughs  that  not  only  introduce  the  level  ahead  but  also  the  route  through  it  or  they  deliver  “visions”  of  the  next  level  as  prerendered scenes that give a glimpse of challenges ahead at every save point  in the game world.  This illustrates the growing level of complexity based on established game  camera traditions. Although Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time shows a lot of  cinematic visuals, it was never marketed as an interactive movie. The advances  in  camera  work  might  be  references  to  cinematic  traditions  but  are  largely  seen as game-intrinsic. How did games reach such a level of complexity? To  get an overview of the use of cameras in games today, we have to return to  the  basic  camera  building  blocks  and  search  for  their  visual  developments.  The aim is not to discuss a history of video games but to outline the gradual  development  of  visualization  techniques.  The  argument  will  be  that  the   Cinema and Game Spaces  95   camera developed its own presence in the game space and became accessible  to the player. Cameras turned into active performers in the game world. They  work  not  only  on  the  mediated  plane  but  also  on  the  rule-driven  plane  as  functional and interactive entities.  7.5.1  Changes to the Following Camera  A following camera is usually tied to the main character and is a prototypical  example demonstrating the importance of the mobile camera in video games.  In its basic form, it presents the player-avatar and its relation to the space to  be  explored.  Such  a  basic  camera  ﬂ oated,  for  example,  behind  the  avatar  of  Space Harrier  Suzuki 1985 , never granting a view of the hero’s front or face.  Because Space Harrier features a constant forward movement of the hero  and  his enormous gun , the virtual camera is likewise constantly dollying forward  into the game world.  Super  Mario  64  set  a  deﬁ ning  moment  in  the  development  of  the  following camera. Like Space Harrier, the game predominantly uses a following  camera’s  third-person  point  of  view  to  depict  the  famous  Italian  plumber’s  movement  through  the  3D  world  of  platforms  and  pitfalls.  But  unlike  the  linear  ﬂ ying  path  in  Space  Harrier, Super  Mario  64  offers  a  whole  world  to  explore.  It  expands  the  originally  2D  world  of  Super  Mario  Bros.  into  a  3D  game space. That demands new camera strategies to allow for a comparable  jump-and-run gameplay. Three main cameras support this transition into 3D:  “Mario Cam”  basically a normal following camera , “Fixed Cam”  where the  player can ﬁ x the camera’s position in space and it only orients itself toward  Mario ,  and  “Lakitu  Cam.”  The  revolutionary  Lakitu  Cam  system  of  Super Mario  64  allowed  the  player  to  control  the  following  camera  and  circle  it  around the main avatar to explore the spatial positioning of Mario in relation  to the whole surrounding video game space. The fundamental jump-and-run  functionality of the title stays true to its predecessors, but the presentation is  improved  to  support  the  same  basic  interactive  gameplay  features  in  a  3D  game space. To highlight this invention, the game introduces the camera as  a  character:  Lakitu—an  occasionally  visible  camera  operator,  who  follows  Mario on his adventures.  Players control both the main hero, Mario, and his camera operator, Lakitu.  The camera turns into an active entity next to the avatar. In fact, the active  camera can have a direct impact on the entity of the player-avatar. Turning  the camera a certain direction in the default setting can also direct the forward  motion  of  Mario.  Hero  avatar  control  and  control  of  the  presentation  are  intertwined. The axis between following camera and hero remains the deﬁ ning  forward-pointing vector.  Chapter 7  96   Figure 7.5 Super Mario 64  left : Mario in front of a mirror that also reﬂ ects his personal  camera operator Lakitu; Zanzarah: The Hidden Portal  right : a following camera independent  of the player-avatar’s orientation  Figure  7.6  Differentiation  of  the  following  camera; Space Harrier:  hero  and  camera  on  a  ﬁ xed axis; Super Mario 64’s Lakitu Cam: camera can rotate around hero and also sets direc- tion for movement; Zanzarah and Super Mario 64: camera rotates around hero independently  from movement axis  This axis can also be opened up and made optional. Zanzarah: The Hidden  Portal features a young girl, Amy, exploring a vast 3D world. The camera is  a following camera under the player’s control, circling around the exploring  girl.  But—just  as  in  Super  Mario  64—when  standing,  the  player  can  circle  the camera around the central avatar without affecting the forward direction.  The immediate connection between movement action and camera position— seen in games like Space Harrier—is gone.  The  result  is  a  very  different  image  composition.  Instead  of  focusing  on  the background of the image as the visual goal of the main character, such a  freely  rotating  camera  opens  up  the  visual  exploration  of  the  surrounding  game space. For example, the camera can integrate a relevant foreground, goal,  or reference point for the character. The player remains focused on the main   Cinema and Game Spaces  97   character but explores the game environment on both levels: as hero and as  detached camera operator.  Finally, Max Payne uses different levels of following cameras attached to  different  subjects.  While  the  game  itself  is  dominated  by  an  over-the- shoulder-like  following  camera  that  follows  the  main  hero,  a  specialized  “bullet ride” following camera is automatically activated when a deadly shot  is ﬁ red at the last opponent of a ﬁ ght. This bullet ride camera is highly mobile,  expressive, and tied into the unfolding event. It ends with a cut back to the  character-centered following camera once the dramatic death of the last enemy  has been presented using yet another camera. Such a focus on the mobility  and  speed  of  the  camera  recalls  the  effects  of  the  mobile  camera  in  ﬁ lm  as  previously outlined. Instead of representing the viewpoint of a ﬂ ying snowball  in Napoléon, the camera now follows a single bullet to its target. Gance dra- matizes young Napoleon’s strategic ambitions, while Max Payne celebrates a  player’s victory.  With the assemblage of different cameras and sequences in Max Payne, the  following camera not only has grown into a player-controlled entity but has  also detached itself from the hero-avatar to increase visual impact. From the  originally simple traversing of the game space in pursuit of the main character  as seen in Space Harrier, the following camera has grown to visualize the rela- tionship of the character to the world from variable perspectives, as seen in  Super Mario 64 or Zanzarah. Finally, it has started to position itself in a frame- work of other cameras that add up to a cinematically generated space that can  occasionally detach from the main character—as seen in Max Payne.  The result is a very different depiction of the game space and a different  cinematic space. The monotonous ﬁ xation of the early Space Harrier following  camera  on  a  game  character  supported  a  singular  action  in  a  simple  game  world. The Super Mario 64 camera supports an explorative style to show the  character  in  his  relation  to  a  more  complex  game  world  where  the  player  gains control over the visualization axes between camera and hero. Breaking  this  axis  allows  for  a  double  exploration,  as  seen  in  Zanzarah:  The  Hidden  Portal.  The  camera  operates  more  independently  from  the  hero-avatar  and  provides a visual stimulus under the player’s control for further visual world  exploration.  The  space  just  ahead  of  the  character  is  visually  accessible,  as  well as the whole surrounding—independent from the main avatar’s orienta- tion. Max Payne exempliﬁ es an end to the single focus and a cinematic game  world  presentation  that  depends  on  editing  and  a  combination  of  cameras.  The moving camera explores a range of spaces  that of the hero, of the last  bullet,  and  a  set  scene   from  which  the  player  has  to  reassemble  the  game  space.  Chapter 7  98   The development of the following camera over time, thus, is a widening  of the spatial representation. The changes allow for a wider range of presenta- tion techniques of this space and thereby enrich the visual vocabulary of video  games. Modern following cameras can be more complex, explore more spaces,  and provide a richer experience of a video game space. This increase of expres- sive  range  emerges  from  closer  connections  between  three  planes:  the  rule- driven,  mediated,  and  ﬁ ctional.  While  Space  Harrier  remains  on  a  basic  rule-driven and simpliﬁ ed mediated plane, Super Mario 64 and its successors  shift emphasis onto the mediated plane as the camera is acknowledged as its  own entity. Reading this space and forming the ﬁ ctional plane can be enhanced  by more camera detachment and the end of the domination of the single long  shot as seen in Max Payne.  7.5.2  Changes to the Overhead View  The overhead view consists of a viewing position that hovers above the virtual  playground. The player is looking down onto the events on the surface of the  virtual  world  below.  It  resembles  the  perspective  of  a  general  on  a  tactical  map or a goddess to a world below her feet and it does not come as a surprise  that this is the camera featured in many tactical sim games and so-called god  games. The initial form detaches the player from the game space. One example  is the isometric view.  Isometric views eliminate any distortion of the depicted shape caused by  the perspective. There is no single focal point that would help to concentrate  the picture or ﬁ xate its orientation.  True  isometric  views  are  an  artistic  construct  and  always  include  a  level  of  abstraction,  because  the  real  world  is  not  perceived  in  that  way.  Isome - tric  drawings  are  used  for  technical  descriptions  and  can  trick  the  view  in   Figure 7.7 Q*Bert  Intellivision port of the orginal game by Davis and Lee 1982  as example  of  a  true  isometric  view   left ; Warcraft: Orcs and Humans  as  example  of  direct  top-down  view with false isometric effect  right   Cinema and Game Spaces  99   Escher-like  visual  impossibilities.  Because  of  the  square  pixels  that  are  the  smallest visual unit for most video games, the result of true isometric perspec- tive can lead to awkward pixilation especially in older games and many have  instead opted for a different angle.  Any of these overhead views—isometric or not—exclude complete exami- nation of the world because the player cannot get closer or change the basic  setup.  The  introduction  of  fully  navigable  3D  game  spaces  to  god  games  changed that.  Many virtual worlds have changed from 2D to 3D spaces. But do they truly  adapt to the new conditions of 3D space in presentation and functionality?  Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos  Prado 2002  consists of a fully navigable 3D world  and allows changing views of this world while its predecessors Warcraft: Orcs  and Humans  Fitch et al. 1994  and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness  Millar et al.  1995   were  limited  to  isometric  views  faking  a  3D  view.  The  3D  space  of  Warcraft  III or  Age  of  Mythology allows the player to “move into” the game  space. It can take interactors almost to ground level and thereby changes their  positioning from god-like generals to co-heroes in visual terms. This unlocks  new gameplay possibilities and variable player positioning.  But Warcraft  III  does  not  utilize  the  new  possibilities  offered  through  a  ﬂ exible viewpoint in its functionality. The game neither encourages the inter- actor to actually use the ground-level camera, for example, to ﬁ nd a certain  item only visible in a closer view; nor does it deﬁ ne the ground-level view as  the only available visualization for one particular mission or parts of a mission  to change the game experience. Instead, players can ﬁ nish the game without  ever changing the camera view or even realizing that this option exists in the  game.  Likewise,  Age  of  Mythology  fails  to  utilize  these  camera  options.  The  game uses a complex narrative setting that includes ﬂ ashbacks and dream-like  levels,  but  the  newfound  visual  freedom  of  its  3D  presentation  is  never  enforced through the camera to support these situations.  In contrast, Tong and Tan argue that the free overhead camera in the game  Ground Control  Walﬁ sz 2000  “is not only vital to the enjoyment of the game  but  also  serves  as  an  important  measure  for  effective  gameplay”   Tong  and  Tan 2002, 106 . Their analysis, especially of the heightened aesthetic value  of the experience, is persuasive. Their detailed examples, though, indicate that  the de facto value of the free camera for the functionality in Ground Control is  limited to an “alternative to performing a more logical yet uninteresting aerial  scan  of  the  location”   ibid.,  108 .  It  is  neither  a  necessity  nor  a  dramatic  improvement. Unlike the cinematic camera, where the choice of viewpoint is  a crucial narrative element, the breathtaking freedom of the virtual camera is  reduced  to  an  “alternative”  or  optional  feature.  It  is  not  connected  to  the   Chapter 7  100   interactive access or narrative stance and remains on the level of an aesthetic  effect with little impact. The expressive range is widened but not in combina- tion with the functionality of the title and thus it remains pointless. Warcraft III and Age of Mythology both feature complex narrative settings and occasional  search  missions  in  which  the  player  is  conﬁ ned  to  very  small  resources,  at  times  controlling  only  one  character.  But  the  games  still  apply  the  same  camera work used in the great battle scenarios with numerous entities under  the player’s control. The camera is free, but unlike in ﬁ lm the new freedom  remains unexplored.  A main reason for this lack of direction is the missing reference point to a  single character. The plan view of the battleﬁ eld remains functionally neutral  and no single object or character is supposed to visually dominate. Warcraft  III  and  Age  of  Mythology  use  the  notion  of  heroes  as  special  characters  that  provide  a  narrative  framework  but  usually  are  not  acting  alone  and  often  remain  just  one  unit  among  countless  others  on  the  virtual  battleground.  Unlike the focus of the following camera, there is no ﬁ xed binding to a speciﬁ c  user-avatar. Thus, direction of the camera work has to rely on other attractors:  one can call a view to the home location in Warcraft III via a button click; or  jump to the position of the current enemy attack as well as to any hero or  unit under one’s command. Whether it is the most valuable object or a regular  unit, the camera does not distinguish between them, rate them, or build up  dramatic connections between them. Neither does it concentrate on any single  location  on  the  map.  The  camera  can  jump  anywhere  at  any  time—like  a  ﬁ nger  does  when  pointing  to  different  attractions  on  a  map.  This  enhances  the functionality but does not develop the expressive range as the camera view  stays in the overhead position.  Metal Gear Solid offers a wider cinematic range of camera angles tied to the  main character based on a hybrid overhead-view following camera. Unlike in  god  games,  where  the  player  can  usually  select  and  affect  a  lot  of  different  characters, the stealth agent Solid Snake is the only player-controlled character  in Metal Gear Solid. The dominating perspective in Metal Gear Solid is that of  an overhead view that focuses on this main character. It is closer to the ground  than the standard viewpoints in Age of Mythology or Warcraft III and shows  every detail of the game world so that the player can interact with it yet is  high enough to provide a strategic overview. A number of additional cameras  are  available  to  support  the  dramatic  presentation.  For  example,  the  player  can  switch  to  a  ﬁ rst-person  perspective  at  any  time.  Other  cameras  are  connected to the position of Solid Snake within the virtual space. The view  closes in whenever the main character hides close to a wall, and jumps back  to the overhead view whenever the avatar is moving through open space. The   Cinema and Game Spaces  101   spatially conditioned camera connects the player’s movement to the visualiza- tion; the rule-based plane connects to the mediated plane. This dynamic and  conditional camera work precisely answers the call for better implementation  of a more expressive virtual camera.  These cameras are not optional but integral elements of the game. Interac- tors cannot succeed in Metal Gear Solid without activating these views, as some  elements  of  the  ﬁ ctional  world  cannot  be  experienced  without  them.  To  support this more directed camera style, the interactive access of the user to  camera control is more limited than in Age of My thology. Players of Metal Gear  Solid  usually  cannot  zoom  in  or  move  the  camera  independently  from  the  main avatar or another in-game reference object. Instead, cameras are applied  either as direct interactive access  players can activate the ﬁ rst-person point  of view  or indirect consequence  the user-avatar’s position within the game  spaces  activates  a  different  viewpoint   in  a  meaningful  and  dramatic  way.  Metal Gear Solid indicates that different camera settings can be combined with  a dominant overhead view—at least within a character-based setting. Instead  of staying detached from the virtual playground, such elaborate camera work  can draw the interactor closer to the event both in terms of visual representa- tion as well as functional access. The cameras offer a more ﬂ exible and dynamic  visual relation to the game space.  7.5.3  Changes to the First-Person Point of View  Adding more dynamic camera work to ﬁ rst-person point of view titles seems  to be the hardest task. Because the basic functionality of these titles stays often  very ﬁ xed, so does the camera and the way the game space is delivered by the  presentation. The ﬁ rst-person point of view is usually tied to the view of one  ﬁ ctional character  or object  that operates inside the video game space and  under the control of an interactor. Again, technical limitations were part of  the development of the visualization strategy.  Titles such as Battlezone, Castle Wolfenstein 3D, and DOOM  Romero et al.  1993  offered a ﬁ rst-person point of view restricted to two axes. Players could  not  look  up  but  only  move  “into”  the  screen  horizontally.  In  Battlezone— arguably  one  of  the  ﬁ rst  ﬁ rst-person  games—players  control  a  virtual  tank  and the camera work mimics a periscope-like view into the video game space.  In  an  interesting  combination  of  play  space,  mediated  space,  and  ﬁ ctional  space, some of the original arcade cabinets include an artiﬁ cial periscope that  frames the monitor.  This assigned ﬁ rst-person point of view can only be controlled along the  horizontal plane. Players can rotate and dolly the virtual camera forward and  backward by navigating their tank and exploring the video game space. The   Chapter 7  102   periscope interface itself seems to explain the limitations at hand. On the one  hand, such a limitation can be attributed to technical constraints; on the other  hand,  we  face  again  the  question  of  literacy.  Ed  Rotberg—Battlezone’s  lead  programmer—also developed a free camera that would navigate much more  freely for the ﬂ ight simulator Red Baron  Rotberg 1980 . Red Baron uses basi- cally  the  same  circuit  board  as  Battlezone  and  the  same  vector  graphics.  It would seem that this camera should have been far more effective, released  almost at the same time as the limited Battlezone view. Yet, while Red Baron was no failure, it did not repeat Battlezone’s triumphant success. The reasons  may be legion but one might be the lack of game space literacy in players. In  this dawning of 3D game spaces, players still had to learn how to read and  interact with the 3D space at hand, as it was presented in abstracted vector  graphics as in Battlezone and Red Baron. Battlezone offers environmental features  that provide cover from enemy ﬁ re and other structures that support orienta- tion   including  an  active  vector  volcano .  The  restrictions  of  the  periscope  seem  to  aid  comprehension  of  these  elements  and  the  navigable  3D  space.  Interaction with them ﬁ t the audiences better than the Red Baron visualization  with its freer camera movement.  But  as  games  developed  their  visual  language,  they  gradually  improved  players’ media literacy. 3D game engines using polygons followed  e.g., F-19 Stealth Fighter [Meier 1988] . Lights and colors became available in the game  space  through  textures  and  sprites   e.g.,  Castle  Wolfenstein  3D  and  DOOM  before textured polygons allowed for a game world with multicolored surfaces   e.g.,  in  Strike  Commander  [Roberts  1993]   and  lighting  features  advanced  further expressive qualities in these speciﬁ c game spaces  e.g., with Quake’s light maps . Ever since, this polygonal form has been under constant reﬁ ne- ment and improved in detail and graphical richness. But what has changed  in regard to the ﬁ rst-person perspective itself?  Pure ﬁ rst-person games such as Return to Castle Wolfenstein, the successor  to the original Castle Wolfenstein 3D, rely exclusively on ﬁ rst-person cameras  throughout, interrupted only by the prescripted cutscenes that use multiple  cameras. Both Wolfenstein titles were graphical milestones and exemplify the  spectacular improvement of 3D engines. However, while the quality of the  graphics available in the game world has improved signiﬁ cantly, the expres- sive freedom of the camera work has stalled.  The slow rate of change in ﬁ rst-person camera in the ﬁ rst-person shooter  is connected to the slow changes of the functionality of these titles. Players  constantly readjust their views in Return to Castle Wolfenstein; they continu- ously scan the virtual world for foes, friends, and useful spatial structures. The  main task of the player is to shoot any approaching enemy and avoid their   Cinema and Game Spaces  103   attacks—the same basic setting can be found in Battlezone. What improved  graphics provide are a higher quality of the same basic gameplay functions  and a much ﬁ ner granularity of these functions. The games’ functionality and  visual expression has not widened but deepened.  the  camera  enters   slasher stalker  ﬁ lms  when   Navigating a character like a virtual camera through a game space closely  resembles the work of a camera operator. The interactor has become the man  with the movie camera as proposed by Vertov. But Vertov’s Man with a Movie  Camera celebrates the camera operator, stages him as the hero of the piece, at  times  highly  visible.  In  contrast,  most  ﬁ rst-person  shooter  games  hide  the  player-character.  A  more  recent—and  ﬁ tting—and  cinematic  reference  that  plays with this hiding effect can be found in the stalker ﬁ lm tradition. Stalker  ﬁ lms had their peak in the late 1970s and early 80s and gave birth to formulas,  later serialized, such as Halloween  Carpenter 1978  or Friday the 13th  Cun- ningham 1980; Dika 1990 . Although the use of a horrifying stalking camera  had been applied earlier, the visual presentation at work in the stalker tradi- tion  makes  the  ﬁ rst-person  camera  formulaic.  It  introduces  patterns.  For  example, Clover highlights the changing use of ﬁ rst-person point of views in  the  the  viewpoint  of the victim—Clover’s “ﬁ nal girl”—or that of the killer. “The ‘eye’ of the  camera  is  collapsed  into  the  ‘I eye’  of  these  characters.  Whereas  the  killer’s  point of view dominates the ﬁ rst part of the ﬁ lm, in the latter part  when the  ﬁ nal girl shifts from victim mode to that of hero , she gains control of the  view or gaze”  Ndalianis 2004, 118, referring to Clover 1992, 45 . We ﬁ nd  Clover’s  ﬁ nal  girl  in  many  survival  horror  games,  but  a  particularly  direct  reference is found in Fatal Frame  aka Project Zero [Shibata 2001] . The Fatal Frame  series  expands  the  theme  further  in  its  sequel,  Fatal  Frame  II:  The  Crimson Butterﬂ y, where the ﬁ nal girl is doubled into the “ﬁ nal twin sisters.”  In Fatal Frame III: The Tormented  Shibata 2005 , the player controls return  again mainly to one woman, although Fatal Frame III also includes control  over a male hero for the ﬁ rst time in the series. These games follow Clover’s  theory of a combination of the hero view and the empowerment of the ﬁ nal  girl to become an active hero. They generate this shift through a connection  of the rule-based and mediated planes. The dominating viewpoint is that of  predeﬁ ned  viewing  planes,  but  whenever  the  player  activates  the  game’s  weapon—a  magic  camera—the  game  switches  into  ﬁ rst-person  perspective.  The moment of “ﬁ ghting back” is the moment of the heroic ﬁ rst-person point  of  view.  It  depends  on  actively  changing  the  view  and  preparing  the  weapon.  The  Fatal  Frame  series  combines  a  ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view  with  predeﬁ ned  viewing  frames  based  on  a  visual  tradition  established  in   Chapter 7  104   earlier survival horror titles such as Alone in the Dark or Resident Evil. How do  pure ﬁ rst-person titles evolve in comparison?  In games that rely entirely on a ﬁ rst-person perspective we might read a  shift of the player-character, often from the unarmed, helpless, and hunted to  the fully equipped killing machine at the end of the game that also reﬂ ects  the player’s growth in experience. In the beginning of Unreal  Blesninski and  Schmalz 1998  or Halo: Combat Evolved       J. Jones 2001 , the player is inexpe- rienced  and  the  virtual  hero  is  helplessly  unarmed,  but  soon  they  start  to  gather an arsenal of weapons and the player gradually learns how to master  them. The view stays consistent, but the dramatic position of the hero changes  from victim to killer, while the game space changes from threat to familiar  and mastered ground.  In  parallel,  the  basic  shooting  view  is  enriched  through  different  views,  such as a sniper view, virtual night vision, or other effects, which allow for a  more  complex  visualization.  Movement  in  three  dimensions  also  allows  for  more  complex  interaction  with  the  environment,  using  it  as  cover  or  even  element against the enemies. The ﬁ rst-person camera is the optimized view  for many of these tasks, and changing the view can jeopardize the functionality  of  important  design  elements,  such  as  precise  shooting.  That  is  why  ﬁ rst- person camera games often reject any fundamental changes, but offer reﬁ ne- ments through these kinds of visual enrichments. A case in point is the Call of Duty series, which offers increasing improvements of the visual display of  a ﬁ rst-person shooter game while holding onto a rigid interaction design as  it  continuously  restages   predominantly  World  War  II,  although  the  latest  installment is set in a modern-day war scenario  battles.  This kind of limited visualization often has more in common with theatri- cal,  not  cinematic,  presentation  forms.  Half-Life,  a  successful  video  game  often  credited  for  its  cinematic  qualities   e.g.,  Mactavish  2002 ,  includes  prescripted action sequences that the player encounters in a consistent ﬁ rst- person  point  of  view.  These  events  share  qualities  with  theatrical  staged  actions—like action-themed lazzi—enacted on the virtual stage of the Half- Life world. While any movie would elaborate these events via visual foreshad- owing,  a  climatic  buildup  through  different  visual  means,  and  a  cut  once  the  event  has  been  resolved,  Half-Life  does  not  incorporate  any  of  these  visual strategies. In this regard, players of Half-Life are not participating in  a ﬁ lm but in a play. Because of this lack of editing, the game space in Half- Life  is  a  virtual  stage,  not  a  ﬁ lm  set.  The  same  is  true  for  Call  of  Duty, where the scripted and unscripted AI behavior can be so massive and wide- spread that the player is bound to miss the details. The stage is too big and   Cinema and Game Spaces  105   too active to be fully comprehensible, and the game space diverts clearly from  cinematic space in its abundance of action.  But one can ﬁ nd the occasional cinematic effect even in this kind of pure  ﬁ rst-person game. For example, in the midst of what could be called the ﬁ rst  act of Half-Life, the player is teleported back and forth between two different  worlds—the virtual earth and an alien planet. In cinematic terms the telepor- tation constitutes a cut because it is a change of location. Likewise, Deus Ex features  a  cut  that  mimics  the  unconsciousness  of  the  main  hero:  at  one  moment, the player-character is overpowered and the view fades to black, only  to fade back into the view of a prison cell in which the hero is being held.  Here the cut is a fade and indicates a change of time and location. More often,  though, game designers limit spatial navigation in order to shape the percep- tion of prescripted events. In those situations, players control their view but  are restricted in their avatars’ movements. Designers shape the possible views  available to the player by means of stage design and spatial conditioning.  For example, during the opening sequence of Half-Life I control the char- acter of Gordon Freeman, whose background is gradually revealed to me as  he travels on a moving monorail wagon into the ﬁ ctional Black Mesa Research  Facility  and  right  into  the  heart  of  the  adventure.  During  the  ride  I  catch  countless little events through the wide-open windows of the monorail: sci- entists  seem  to  prepare  experiments,  robots  transport  goods,  guards  are  on  duty. All of these events are prescripted to provide an atmospheric introduc- tion  to  the  game  world.  My  viewpoint  is  roughly  deﬁ ned  by  the  position  and size of the monorail wagon that continues to take my hero further into  the core of the ﬁ ctional world. However, the precise orientation and detailed  position of this view is left to me as I control Freeman’s movements and views  inside the monorail carrier. I steer the avatar inside the limited space of the  wagon  and  become  an  active  witness  of  the  events  happening  around  the  carriage.  One could speak of a “narrating architecture” that enforces a certain vision  through the limitation of the spatial practice within it. The world takes the  player for a ride like a linear amusement park. Visually, the effect in Half-Life mirrors the long opening shot used to establish a certain location and setting  up  to  the  beginning  of  the  main  events  as  seen,  for  example,  in  The  Player  Altman 1992 , which itself quotes Welles’s Touch of Evil  1958 . Other games  apply these kinds of guided visual introductions at different dramatic moments.  The form seems to create its own tradition. Instead of a cutscene we encounter  a gameplay scene that blends elaborate staging and camera restrictions with  some interactive access. Half-Life’s successor, Half-Life 2 ties the player to a  prison-like transporter pod to stage the level transition and ﬁ nal twist in the   Chapter 7  106   plot.  The  player  cannot  move  but  looks  around  to  watch  while  computer- controlled game characters and co-heroes perform the  almost  ﬁ nal plot rev- elation. Prey  Rhinehart 2006  uses a comparable prescripted “ride” to introduce  a  main  switch  in  location  when  the  hero  and  his  friends  are  abducted  and  transported into some alien mother ship—again in the tradition of a spatially  restricted interactive establishing shot. One could argue that Half-Life estab- lished  the  restricted  ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view  as  an  interactive  and  visual  tradition in ﬁ rst-person shooter games.  The  D-Day  level  of  Call  of  Duty 2   Rieke  2005   fades  in  as  I  control  a  soldier  on  board  a  landing  boat  approaching  the  French  shore.  As  mortars  explode and machine gun ﬁ re rips through my virtual fellow soldiers, I dash  forward to ﬁ nd cover. But I cannot avoid stepping too close to an explosion  and my virtual hero is knocked over. The ﬁ rst-person point of view and audio  simulate a shell-shock effect of the main character lying helplessly paralyzed  on the shore. But I am picked up by a non-player character, dragged to safety,  and healed. Only then do I regain control over the virtual hero’s movements.  Again, movement and behavior are restricted to establish a dramatized new  context. Here the effect is less of an introductory shot but more of a visual  exclamation mark emphasizing the chaos of the situation as well as the com- munity of virtual soldiers.  The tradition has become so accepted that some ﬁ rst-person video games  can  add  directed  force  to  it.  They  gradually  adjust  the  player’s character’s  viewpoint  and  direct  the  attention  to  speciﬁ c  elements  in  the  game  world.  If Super  Mario  64  introduced  a  detached  third-person  perspective,  then  these  games  establish  the  ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view  as  a  distinct  camera  entity—somewhat detached from the player’s control and with its own will.  Breakdown uses a constant ﬁ rst-person point of view and uses spatial design  to structure the presentation as well as functionality. For example, when hit,  the  avatar’s  body  might  shake  uncontrollably,  or  when  drugged,  the  avatar  might  be  paralyzed.  The  title  features  prescripted  cutscenes  from  the  ﬁ rst- person point of view and visual effects that support spatially restricted interac- tive vistas.  In  addition,  Breakdown  enforces  gentle  camera  adjustments  to  indicate  important events. Unless the player counters these movements, the game has  sections where the view is directed and staged—much like the events in the  prescripted  moments.  In  contrast  to  Half-Life,  attention  in  Breakdown  can  be  focused  by  the  computer  and  not  only  left  to  the  player.  The  player  is  free to override such adjustments at any point, but the camera nevertheless  expresses  its  own  logic.  One  remains  the  “man  with  the  movie  camera,”  but the camera apparatus, the impersonated virtual character, starts to gain   Cinema and Game Spaces  107   its  own  will,  which  allows  Breakdown  to  accentuate  special  elements  in  the  game world.  To summarize, the developments of the ﬁ rst-person point of view remain  character-centric but elaborate on the possibilities of staging this character in  more precise and dramatic moments in the game world. The game world itself  is consciously used as a form of visual frame for the presentation and some  indicators point back to a direct control of the image. Combinations of all of  these features introduce a more structured and dramatized version of the seem- ingly player-ﬁ xated ﬁ rst-person point of view.  The changes in the presentation of the ﬁ rst-person viewpoint in regard to  the game space are connected to the virtual hero body and the player’s master- ing of this body in the game world. The better the player becomes, the more  the same space might change from a threat to a kind of “killing playground.”  While  the  camera  stays  the  same,  its  visual-narrative  stance  changes.  The  second option is to affect the virtual body, the man as the camera, and thus  shape the visualization. This is often accomplished with a technical add-on   like a sniper view using different optics , a physical impact on the body  like  spatial limitation of the view by limiting navigation , or a change of the per- ception  like adding a ﬁ lter or distortion to simulate a different state of con- sciousness .  In  this  way,  the  ﬂ exibility  of  camera  work  is  thrown  onto  the  virtual  body.  While  the  overall  visual  principle  might  remain  the  same,  the state of the body as a simulated spatial entity inside the game space gains  relevance  for  the  visualization.  The  tightly  knit  dependency  between  rule- based and mediated plane through this focus on the virtual body situates the  camera in the game world. However, when the view is adjusted by the com- puter  and  the  camera  seems  to  develop  its  own  logic,  we  even  notice  an  emerging camera entity from within the original ﬁ rst-person concept.  7.5.4  Changes to the Predeﬁ ned Viewing Frames  Static,  predeﬁ ned  viewing  frames  have  the  advantage  of  offering  optimized  and perfectly framed views of a given area. They are largely precoded in their  position and behavior. Because of the game system’s control over these cameras,  these visualizations can quote cinematic shots and make the best possible use  of  the  set  and  its  lighting,  effects,  and  staging.  In  other  words,  predeﬁ ned  viewing frames allow for an optimized mise-en-scène in game spaces as in ﬁ lm  sets. Such optimization can direct attention in a highly dramatic way.  Thanks to this optimization, Alone in the Dark or Resident Evil can reference  horror movies like Romero’s Night of the Living Dead  1968  as each view can  be  arranged  by  the  designer  in  a  way  comparable  to  that  of  a  ﬁ lm  director  or  director  of  cinematography   see,  e.g.,  Krzywinska  2002,  209 .  Virtual   Chapter 7  108   lighting, set design, staging, and effects are designed to reinforce one subjec- tive viewpoint and to achieve the best dramatic impact for the visualization  according to cinematic convention. Predeﬁ ned viewing frames might appear  to be the most cinematic visual approach of the four basic camera positions  deﬁ ned  earlier,  but  they  can  also  include  technical  limitations.  Many  older  titles—including Resident  Evil—use  prerendered  images  as  backgrounds.  Using this technique allows for a higher graphical detail but constrains the  camera to one ﬁ xed viewpoint, as any movement would reveal the lack of true  perspective and missing parallax effect. Such a camera is technically conﬁ ned  to a static view.  A most memorable scene of the original Resident Evil game uses this static  visualization: I am steering the main hero down a corridor while the camera  remains at the entry point to the hallway. At the end of the corridor I can  sense  a  corner,  and  as  my  hero  approaches  this  corner  I  expect  the  cut to a new camera angle showing me the space behind it. Instead a pair of  vicious dogs suddenly crashes through a window in the foreground and starts  to attack.  The interesting element here is that the camera allows a staging of this sur- prise attack in the foreground. The enemy invades the space between me, the  player, and the hero standing with his back to the attackers. The space between  hero and camera—between hero and player—becomes the danger zone.  A  more  recent  installment  of  the  franchise,  Resident  Evil  4   Matsushita 2005 , also plays repeatedly with the visual connection among danger element,  hero, and player. Its camera is more dynamic and mainly moves along pre- deﬁ ned patterns in relation to the progress of the main hero. At times, navi- gational control is taken from the player and replaced by Quick Timer Events   QTEs   that  use  very  different  functionality.  QTEs  change  the  interaction   Figure 7.8 Resident Evil details; use of foreground for action  left ; example for predeﬁ ned  viewing frames and use of light  right   Cinema and Game Spaces  109   mode of a game from in-world interaction to a kind of reaction and matching  game that asks the player to press a certain combination of buttons as fast as  possible  to  trigger  often  very  specialized  and  predeﬁ ned  action  sequences.  Players  often  do  not  know  what  these  inputs  will  actually  trigger.  Because  this is a space-independent reaction test during which other interaction modes  are paused, the virtual camera is free to work its magic.  After ﬁ ghting my way through a village packed with deadly half-human  enemies, I ﬁ nd myself at the starting point of an empty path that winds down  a hill. Stepping forward triggers a QTE. A short cutscene shows some remain- ing villains pushing a giant boulder down a cliff. The boulder crashes onto  the  path  behind  me  and  starts  rolling  toward  my  hero  as  well  as  toward  me, the player, because the camera is in front of the virtual hero. The shot  cites the opening sequence of Raiders of the Lost Ark  Spielberg 1981 . Like  Indiana Jones in one of the seminal shots of that movie, my hero has to run  toward the camera. Resident Evil 4 delivers an even more continuous shot as  the camera dollies backward to keep the view. So while I bash buttons to make  my hero run and escape the danger, the camera continues to show the boulder  closing in on the hero as well as the camera in front of the running character  looking back at the action.  Ico   Ueda  2001   offers  a  different  addition  to  predeﬁ ned  views  as  it  uses  cameras tied to special positions within the game space and triggered by the  spatial progress of the player-character. The game allows players to rotate and  pan the view from that given position as well as to zoom in to the player- avatar. As in Super Mario 64, the camera behavior is potentially detached from  the hero-character and is its own interactive entity. The active camera is still  triggered  by  the  avatar’s  position  in  the  level  but  its  orientation  and  zoom  are—within limits—accessible to the player. The result is a smooth, almost  unrecognizably  complex  and  highly  effective  visualization.  The  preset  view  prompts the player to recognize the spatial puzzle at hand as seen in Prince of  Persia: The Sands of Time. It can emphasize thresholds to overcome or paths to  take.  The  camera  is  mobile  to  keep  the  hero  in  view  and  in  the  necessary  relation  to  the  set  spatial  puzzle.  At  the  same  time,  the  player  has  limited  control  over  the  camera’s  orientation.  This  allows  visual  exploration  of  the  game space in the search for the next clue in the spatial puzzle setup of Ico beyond the predeﬁ ned frame. Often no camera adjustment is necessary to solve  a certain puzzle but as the understanding of spatial connections is at the heart  of Ico, the limited camera control allows for a “closer look” and more inde- pendent  exploration  that,  in  return,  support  the  necessary  planning  of  the  route ahead. Players engage not only as active navigators but also as visually  exploring camera operators in the game space.  Chapter 7  110   Ico  is  also  an  interactive  example  for  Monaco’s  “open  form”  of  framing  as the player-controlled camera can lose sight of the main avatar. “Open and  closed forms are closely associated with the elements of movement in the frame.  If the camera tends to follow the subject faithfully, the form tends to be closed;  if, on the other hand, the ﬁ lmmaker allows—even encourages—the subject to  leave the frame and reenter, the form is obviously open”  Monaco 2000, 185 .  Any game using predeﬁ ned viewing frames can feature this kind of openness  because  it  can  depict  movement  through  the  frame  and  toward  the  image  borders. But Ico expands this notion. Now, the player can direct the camera in  such a way as to lose sight of the hero and instead concentrate on the surround- ing  game  space.  The  character  does  not  move  beyond  the  frame;  the  frame  leaves the character. Players even continue to control their avatar off-screen.  Once again, camera and hero control are detached from each other.  Preset  viewing  frames  have  developed  from  single  perspectives  tied  to  certain locations, to mobile cameras dynamically tied to locations and avatar  positioning, to interactive cameras partially dependent on the character pro- gression. Such a development greatly improves the available range of camera  work depicting the character inside the game space and changes the player’s  own relation to the game world through the new interactive access. In games  like Ico, the player controls once more both the movie camera and the subject  of the shot. Such a setup implies a high level of literacy and control—a level  that can allow not only for new visualization but also gameplay, as the pre- deﬁ ned camera itself can become an object of gameplay.  The  survival  horror  title  Eternal  Darkness:  Sanity’s  Requiem   Dyak  2002   projects  the  “sanity”  of  the  game  character  onto  the  camera  work,  which  mainly  consists  of  predeﬁ ned  mobile  cameras.  Whenever  the  game  hero  encounters too many disturbing incidents without mastering them, the sanity  level decreases and may affect the visualization of the game world as well as  the behavior of the hero. The camera can tilt, additional frightening elements  may become visible, the screen may simulate a failure and display computer  system error messages, the hero may shoot into the camera leaving buckshot  holes in the screen of the player, and other effects might be used. Through  such  complex  visualization,  the  game  “plays  the  player”   see  Perron  2005 ,  and it does so through an interesting use of visualization strategies. Eternal Darkness gives the camera its own physical substance. Buckshot holes on the  screen indicate the presence of a monitor. This opens up a new layer for the  game visualization that plays with the mediated space and the screen itself  and reaches out of the rule-driven and ﬁ ctional space into the play space.  First, the gradual development of the predeﬁ ned viewing planes toward a  richer, even self-referencing camera supports the spatial cinematic expression   Cinema and Game Spaces  111   of this visualization. Players engage with foreground, background, and even  off-screen spaces. Second, these visual developments exemplify the maturing  of the camera work that transcends different spatial planes. Players complained  about  the  arrangement  of  predeﬁ ned  cameras  in  the  original  Resident  Evil game, as the camera viewpoints occasionally lost track of the player or attack- ing enemies. However, losing sight of the hero or limiting the viewpoint’s  functionality  for  the  player  can  become  an  interactive  option  in  Ico  or  an  expressive option in Eternal Darkness.  The growing complexities within the four basic camera styles indicate that  emerging visual styles promise to be far more varied and richer in expression  than the original basic cameras. The cameras themselves have become acces- sible and their operation is now part of the play experience. Highly developed  cameras  become  play  elements  themselves.  These  cameras  have  turned  into  performers, comparable to player-avatars but with a different task. They do  not affect the action but narrate the event. In this function they can play the  player. They play with a guided presentation that enforces certain viewpoints  or are played by the player within given limits. Opening up the narrating to  the  interactor  and  implementing  complex  and  interactive  camera  controls  includes the player in the process of the game space narration.  Space is still told and presented in this narrating stance. But it can include  players in the process through advances in the four basic cameras. It seems  that  with  growing  literacy,  the  player  is  allowed  to  step  beyond  the  fabula creation and also gains access to the narrating process. The rules that empower  the  virtual  man  with  a  movie  camera  are  the  new  paradigm  for  creating  a  visual  engagement  with  the  player.  The  question  is  not  only  what  events  players can affect, but also what visual contexts of such events can they create  in the game space.  7.6  Performing Cameras  The interconnection of action and presentation shifts the virtual camera from  a presenting device to an interactive cocreative one. Cameras and actors are  involved in a constant, dynamic, and often player-triggered spatial ballet. The  more the player gains control over the viewpoint, the less this ballet can be  predicted.  The handheld camera can draw the audience into the event space through  the  sheer  involvement  of  the  camera  in  that  space.  In  the  rape  scene  of  A Clockwork  Orange   Kubrick  1971 ,  the  camera  is  in  the  midst  of  the  crime,  almost  as  another  rapist;  Raging  Bull   Scorsese  1980   pulls  the  camera  into  the boxing ring and into the ﬁ ght; in Festen  Vinterberg 1998   as well as in   Chapter 7  112   other Dogme ﬁ lms  any use of tripods is forbidden and the camera reacts to the  spontaneous  and  often  improvised  scenes.  However,  the  image  in  all  these  examples remains ﬁ xed, and the ﬁ nal negative is absolute.  While the ﬁ lm camera offers a ﬁ xed image, the virtual camera can team  up with the player during the game. Both can be seen as actors collaborating  during the creation and narration of an event. With the growing control of  the player over the camera entity, the performance for the player becomes a  dual one, simultaneously controlling the main actor as well as the camera’s  point of view.  7.6.1  Virtual Camera as Performer  Machinima  has  been  deﬁ ned  as  “animated  ﬁ lmmaking  within  a  real-time  virtual  3D  environment”   Marino  2004,  1 .  Machinima  producers  usually  utilize  3D  game  engines  as  video  production  tools  and  create  video  pieces  from games as performance spaces. Performing cameras are typical for Machin- ima  productions  that  often  use  human  users  as  camera  operators  to  record  events in a virtual world. Often the game engine does not allow for any other  approach, as seen, for example, in the Halo game engine, which led to per- forming cameras in the Red vs. Blue series  Rooster Teeth 2003–2007  or the  Halo talk show This Spartan Life  Burke 2005– .  Thanks to the improving qualities of these engines and the development  of specialized tools for Machinima, but most of all due to the growing body  of work, this technique is gaining acceptance as a subcategory of computer  animation  Salen 2002; Marino 2004; Lowood 2005, 2006; Nitsche 2005a,  2007a . Game developers support the use of their engine for Machinima in  new  installments  of  their  software.  The  Unreal  engine’s  incarnations  from  Unreal  Tournament  2003   Bertucci  et  al.  2002   to  Unreal  Tournament  2004   Bleszinski  and  Morris  2004   to  the  new  Unreal  3  engine  continuously  improved features for Machinima production compared to their predecessor,  the original Unreal Tournament  de Neve et al. 1999 . The same rings true for  other games: The Sims 2  Bradshaw 2004  offers superior movie features com- pared to its predecessor; so does the Source engine of Half-Life 2 in comparison  to  the  original  Half-Life  engine   formerly  based  on  the  Quake  engine ,  and  newer installments of the Halo engine.  Creators  of  Machinima  record  their  virtual  performances  live  from  these  engines on video or digitally capture them frame by frame to create consistent  ﬁ lm clips; or they provide the entire performance as a data log ﬁ le that repro- duces the dramatic events in the engine accordingly. It is during these live  recordings  that  Machinima  exempliﬁ es  both  the  power  and  limitations  of  the  performing  camera.  The  participants  not  only  have  to  stage  the  actors’   Cinema and Game Spaces  113   performances, but also generate appropriate camera work, often directed by  an invisible camera operator. Camera movements, then, are implemented via  the movement and orientation of this camera operator who literally embodies  the viewpoint. These actors have little or no other functionality in the game  space apart from presenting it in an engaging way. Vertov’s kino-eye has found  its perfect form as virtual, often-invisible witness with potentially unlimited  freedom.  Many Machinima productions are created in this fashion including the live  productions of the ILL Clan’s On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lum- berjack  ILL Clan 2003–2004  series as well as its Tra5hTa1k series  ILL Clan  2005– .  These  live  recorded  Machinima  productions  use  improvised  acting  performances  and  capture  them  through  an  extra  camera  operator.  Other  Machinima pieces like the seminal Red vs. Blue series use the same approach  but add more postproduction.  While This Spartan Life and Red vs. Blue are staged in the relatively rigid  game engine of Halo and in ﬁ xed game levels provided by the developer, the  ILL Clan created custom-made virtual worlds for its Machinima series. These  copy television studio setups and often play with their qualities such that it  has become something of a trope to reveal the spaces’ artiﬁ ce. At the end of  On  the  Campaign  Trail  with  Larry  &  Lenny  Lumberjack   performed  at  the  Machinima Film Festival 2003, New York , the characters step out of their  fake  framing  and  reveal  the  visual  tricks  that  deﬁ ned  the  3D  environment  that  was  modeled  for  the  show.  Then  the  main  characters  leave  the  virtual  sound  stage  through  the  virtual  backdoor.  The  ILL  Clan’s  preference  for  playing with TV conventions led to a recreation of the traditional recording  space that replaces the usually much wider original game worlds. The game  as TV world has become a topic for its shows. Breaking this recording space  closes the argument and brings it back to the merger of ﬁ lm sets and game  world. As the player control has expanded into the camera work, the game  space has turned into a ﬁ lm set. It may come as no surprise that some artists  would model their virtual set after its real predecessor.  7.6.2  Cameras in Casablanca  In 2002 and 2003, two Machinima experiments were conducted at the Uni- versity  of  Cambridge  during  which  we  tested  the  effect  of  the  performing  cameras on the surrounding game world. Students had to deliver their own  interpretations  of  a  given  scene  and  soundtrack  from  Curtiz’s  ﬁ lm  classic  Casablanca  1942 . They had to perform their vision of the same scene in a  game environment  using the Unreal engine 2002 and the Virtools develop- ment kit 2003  created by them especially for this occasion. The camera and   Chapter 7  114   editing was controlled by a live operator, who adjusted the shots during the  performance in the virtual world. The operator was an invisible entity present  on the virtual stage, whose positioning, orientation, and movements through  space constituted the ﬁ nal visual interpretation of the performance.  The  students  initially  developed  their  various  camera  strategies  through  storyboards  before  the  actual  stages  were  modeled.  Once  the  virtual  stage  was  assembled  and  rehearsing  started,  the  camera  work  was  reﬁ ned  by  the  camera  operator.  Due  to  manifold—mainly  technical—reasons,  the  perfor- mances of the virtual actors were often slightly “off.” Actors could not ﬁ nd  their  positions  in  space  or  had  difﬁ culties  with  their  animations.  In  spite  of these complications, the ﬂ exible camera operator was able to capture the  scene, not unlike the recording of an improvised scene in a Dogme 95 produc- tion  where  framing  and  mise-en-scène  are  very  dynamic  and  difﬁ cult  to  predict in detail.  To some extent, this kind of camera adjustment is the reversed form of the  meticulously preplanned long takes in traditional ﬁ lm productions. The con- tinuous long shots of Hitchcock’s Rope  1948  or the ﬁ rst-person point of view  of Montgomery’s The Lady in the Lake  1947  work because the ﬁ lm sets and the  actors’ performances are optimized for the camera. Meanwhile, in our experi- mental  digital  setup  the  planning  was  less  meticulous  and  the  performance  more improvisational. As the workshop setting forced students to perform their  scenes live with a lot more limitations, the acting was far less precise. But the  freedom of the virtual camera somewhat countered this lack of precision. The  laws of the physical world restrict the studio camera’s performance. Hitchcock  had to use extreme precision in the stage design and operation for Rope to make  sure  that  the  predeﬁ ned  camera  movements  could  unfold  on  the  stage.  The  virtual  camera  in  a  Machinima  production  might  perform  in  a  comparable  “live” way but is not conﬁ ned to such physical restrictions. Instead, it has a  greater freedom in its own movements and performance range.  The virtual stage design had to incorporate this freedom. The original set  design for Casablanca  art design by Carl Jules Weyl, sets by George James  Hopkins  already featured larger-than-life proportions with high ceilings and  archways. Now, the space had to be shared with the virtual camera-performer  and  the  performances  developed  from  ballet-like  arrangements  between  the  acting characters and the recording camera. Because the camera could freely  move in any direction at any time, even more space was necessary in the virtual  reinterpretation to accommodate the new freedom.  While the shots were set up in traditional ways, the evolving camera style  of any of the four student groups during the two runs of the Casablanca work- shop did not refer back to the classical Hollywood style, which dominated the   Cinema and Game Spaces  115   original  movie.  Instead  they  used  more  of  the  long  takes  typical  for  Rope, although the group only watched the original Casablanca for inspiration. Both  Rope and Casablanca were based on plays; Hitchcock’s Rope is an adaptation of  a Patrick Hamilton play of 1929, and Curtiz’s Casablanca was based on Murray  Burnett  and  Joan  Alison’s  unproduced  Everybody  Comes  to  Rick’s.  Thus,  an  element of theatrical performance could be traced in both, even though the  camera work in both ﬁ lms differs signiﬁ cantly.  In the Casablanca workshop, the camera operated much more in the long- take  tradition  of  Rope.  The  number  of  cuts  was  considerably  lower  in  the  virtual camera work: in the ﬁ rst experiment  conducted in the Unreal engine ,  both  groups  used  only  seven  camera  cuts  in  comparison  to  the  twenty-ﬁ ve  cuts used in the original Casablanca ﬁ lm scene. But the virtual camera also  differed in its operation from the camera work in Hitchcock’s Rope. The virtual  camera related to the other two characters in the scene not as an overseeing,  all-knowing entity but as an involved character and witness. While Hitchcock  uses  the  camera  to  intensify  the  feeling  of  suspense  in  the  audience,  often  emphasizing  important  clues  in  the  murder  case  that  are  not  visible  to  the  characters  in  the  event,  the  virtual  Casablanca  camera  was  more  reactive  in  relation to the actors and went much more with the ﬂ ow of the action instead  of guiding it.  On the one hand, performing cameras highlight speciﬁ cs of the visualiza- tion  of  video  game  spaces   a  mobile  camera,  long  continuous  takes,  direct  visual  involvement,  high  ﬂ exibility ;  on  the  other  hand,  they  quote  classic  cinematic camera work on various levels and divert from the original game  perspective. The ﬁ rst workshop used the Unreal engine, which is dominated  by a ﬁ rst-person point of view. Yet, the ﬁ rst-person point of view was used  brieﬂ y only once by one group in the Casablanca experiment, while more tra- ditional cinematic strategies dominated throughout.  Whether  in  the  development  of  the  basic  camera  vocabulary,  or  in  the  game-based ﬁ lm productions, each form showed that virtual spaces incorpo- rate elements of classical cinematic mediation and theatrical performance. The  results clearly support the thesis of a rich cinematic vocabulary at work during  the discourse, which can be utilized to create a perspective to the unfolding  interactive events. Virtual cameras support the references between the avatar  body and surrounding space and position the player in relation to this space.  But  interactive  cameras  are  only  one  piece  in  this  process.  The  remaining  challenge  for  this  development  is  the  combination  of  meaningful  dramatic  camera work—the editing of different virtual camera perspectives into longer  sequences.  Chapter 7  116   7.7  Editing Space  Game spaces became too large for a single screen and had to be broken down  into smaller chunks in the presentation. That meant that players could only  explore a subsection of the overall game space at any single moment and the  presentation  addressed  this  in  various  ways.  Intellivision  World  Series  Major  League Baseball  Daglow and Dombrower 1983  allegedly was the ﬁ rst game  to  use  different  perspectives  toward  a  single  event.  Multiple  cameras  were  integrated, fragmenting the interactive playground into separate images from  different  viewpoints.  This  introduced  the  cinematic  element  of  montage  to  games. From that moment on, players had to connect those images to form a  whole  game  space  in  their  ﬁ ctional  space—their  imagination  of  the  game  world. This corresponds to an audience reading a ﬁ lmic space, but there are  signiﬁ cant differences between montage in ﬁ lm and video games that com- plicate a direct transfer.  Montage  in  ﬁ lm  is  understood  as  the  technique  and  result  of  selecting,  editing,  and  piecing  together  separate  ﬁ lm  clips  into  a  linear  sequence.  Montage  in  ﬁ lm  operates  through  fragmentation  and  assembly.  The  editor  takes parts of recorded shots and assembles them into a new whole. It is the  “creation  of  a  sense  or  meaning  not  proper  to  the  images  themselves  but  derived  exclusively  from  their  juxtaposition”   Bazin  1967,  25 .  In  contrast,  3D video games generate the picture on the ﬂ y, usually picking from a number  of viewpoints that perform in space just like the main characters.  Contrary  to  postproduction  editing  in  ﬁ lm,  the  editing  of  a  game  event  happens in real-time. The virtual editor  human or computer  activates a new  virtual camera at a different location within the video game space. However,  this  camera  will  only  render  images  if  activated.  There  is  no  selection  of  images available after the fact of the performance. While such an operation  still provides for a telling of space via moving images, it complicates the tra- ditional  categorization  of  montage  as  a  result of  the  editing.  Following  this  logic, Manovich identiﬁ es an “anti-montage tendency in GUI”  2001, 143 .  But montage as process and modus operandi remains an active force in games.  Moving  images  are  assembled  and  the  resulting  montage  remains  not  only  aesthetic  but  also  functional  in  the  generation  of  the  ﬁ ctional  space.  Poole  recognizes this but argues that camera work in games differs from that in ﬁ lm,  as it should use only the “most useful angle”  2000, 93 . Yet artistic imple- mentation can surpass and question such a plain “usefulness.”  Two elements of editing in video games and their effects on video game  spaces will be elaborated to illustrate the value of editing in the visualization   Cinema and Game Spaces  117   of  video  game  spaces:  ﬁ rst,  the  creation  of  impossible  spaces  through  editing,  and  its  resemblance  to  ﬁ lm’s  continuity  editing;  and  second,  the  element of interactive montage and its connections to a more montage-like  visualization.  7.7.1  Impossible Spaces in Text and 2D  Non-Euclidean space had been applied to new media a long time before 3D  virtual  worlds  came  into  being.  The  interconnection  of  different  rooms  or  locations is not restricted by physical logic in hypertextual forms, MUDs, and  text adventures. That is why they can easily generate seemingly impossible,  ﬁ ctional  diegetic  spaces.  In  these  impossible  spaces,  the  interlinking  between  different lexia is conditional and not logical. The effect can be used to generate  impossible but meaningful virtual structures. Anders points toward the MUD  structure of the virtual Alcatraz location within the BayMOO textual world  that consists of a closed ring of virtual rooms with no way out. Players can  enter the Alcatraz node from a virtual San Francisco node but cannot get out  except via teleporting  Anders 1998, 161 . The quality of a prison is simulated  in  an  eternally  looping  node  network.  In  that  way,  descriptions  of  non- Euclidian  space  can  very  well  depict  certain  qualities,  bending  but  not  breaking the overall coherence.  Video  games  also  featured  impossible  spaces  during  their  2D  era.  The  “tunnel” of Pac-Man connected the left and right screen exits of the Pac-Man maze  together.  It  seemingly  wrapped  the  space  of  the  virtual  playground  together to a cylindrical form to allow the user’s almost immediate appearance  on the left side when moving through the right tunnel entrance. Extending  this wrapped space effect, the original Asteroids game used a 2D playground  with a spherical projection plane. Whenever an asteroid disappeared beyond  the frame it reappeared on the opposite side. This should not be misunder- stood as a merely technical issue of render algorithms; it is predominantly an  issue  of  spatial  design  and  understanding.  This  impossible  space  is  part  of  the core gameplay and a fundamental part of the highly abstracted world of  Asteroids. Poole refers to such spaces as “space purer than any that exists in  the real universe  .  .  .  a pure dream of unhindered movement and harmonious  action”  2000, 129  and contrasts them with the hyperrealistic representations  of environments in modern games.  Once the virtual playground outgrew the single screen, impossible spaces  were presented in the combination of different screens. The “Blue Labyrinth”  in the Atari 2600 Adventure  Robinett 1978  includes impossible jumps and  interconnections between different passages of a 2D maze. It creates a wrapped  spatial construct based on ﬁ ve different screens that are interconnected in a   Chapter 7  118   non-Euclidean way  see also Wolf 2002, 62 . Their inconsistencies are cam- ouﬂ aged with a cut: the jump from one screen to another. Like in the hyper- textual  Alcatraz  example,  locations  can  be  arranged  in  a  mathematically  conditional way. There is no spatial connection between these data ﬁ les, only  a mathematical one, which allows a designer to interlink them in any way.  Visiting players do not experience these spaces as separate from each other, as  their user-avatars are “teleported” to new locations and the fragmentation of  the  virtual  environment  is  hidden  with  the  basic  camera  cut  to  a  different  screen. We do not see that the camera cheated on us during the telling and  generation of space, but only perceive the illusion of a continuous world.  The camera cuts to a view of this avatar in the new space and hides the  spatial distortions behind a visualization that simulates spatial consistency. In  this  way,  cinematic  techniques  can  enhance  the  spatial  coherence  of  video  game spaces that are edited into one perceived entity. The effect points toward  continuity editing that “reinforces spatial orientation”  Bordwell, Staiger, and  Thompson 1985, 55 , while the de facto connections between different spaces  can defy the nature of architectural and spatial logic.  7.7.2  Impossible 3D Spaces  Like  game  worlds,  cinematic  spaces  are  assembled  from  fragments  through  editing and allow for impossible spatial conﬁ gurations. David Lynch’s feature  ﬁ lm  Lost  Highway   1997 ,  for  example,  creates  illogical  spatial  structures  through editing, supported by lighting and camera work. Branigan refers to  these as “impossible’ spaces,” that is “space which can not be justiﬁ ed as existing  wholly within the diegesis”  1992, 44; italics in original . These spaces lead to  perceptual problems “that force the spectator to reconsider prior hypotheses  about  time  and  causality”   ibid.,  44 .  They  disorientate  and  destabilize  the  audience  as  the  spatial,  and  often  the  temporal,  connections  are  broken.  Such  destabilization  is  applied  to  achieve  effects  serving  the  narrative  and  its dramatic impact. The result can be a feeling of being lost in a maze—as  in Adventure—being trapped in a prison—as in the BayMOO version of the  Alcatraz prison—or being trapped in time—as in the role of Fred Madison,  one of the protagonists in Lost Highway. This strategy is also available in 3D  video game spaces. One question in the Common Tales project was how a 3D  game  world  can  carry  a  narrative  through  spatialization.  The  main  setting  focuses on the relationship of the two main characters, who are literally from  different worlds. To illustrate their differences, we created a speciﬁ c level, the  Cube Club, that tried to represent the continuity of space as well as this fun- damental  difference  in  the  main  setting.  Like  the  2D  maze  of  Adventure, the Cube  Club  level,  consists  of  several  separate  structures.  Each  individual   Cinema and Game Spaces  119   Figure  7.9 Common Tales:  the  Cube Club  level  3D  overview   left ;  connections  between  separate spatial units  right   structure is connected to another via invisible “teleporter zones” that instantly  reposition the player-character in a new area. Camera cuts disguise any transi- tion from one part to another, supporting the rules of cinematic continuity  editing. Consequently, the interactor can experience the whole game space as  one coherent location.  The Cube Club level demonstrates that this seemingly coherent space can  in  fact  create  spatially  illogical  constructs  through  cinematic  mediation.  In  this level, two opposing doors from one virtual room lead to similarly oppos- ing doors in a different room. When an avatar leaves the ﬁ rst room through  the northern door, he or she will enter the seemingly adjacent second room,  also through the northern door—the same way the southern doors are con- nected. Both rooms occupy the same logical space—a physical impossibility.  Camera  cuts  hide  the  transition  effect  and  create  the  illusion  of  a  coherent  space. The core concept of Common Tales dealt with ﬁ ctional characters coming  to life once their stories are told. These characters, then, meet the “real life”  in a magical reunion. This magical, yet impossible combination is spatially  represented in the Cube Club level and the impossible space becomes an evoca- tive  narrative  element.  The  impossible  space  is  motivated  by  the  game’s  setting. In Common Tales, the effect enhances the magical character of these  rooms, which are symbols for the main conﬂ ict between the central characters.  The  impossible  space  embodies  the  underlying  theme  through  its  spatial  arrangement and cinematic mediation.  Other  examples  of  physically  impossible  and  virtually  accessible  spaces  include mismatched interior and exterior of 3D structures: a virtual building’s  interior  architecture  can  be  larger  or  smaller,  or  it  can  suggest  a  different  shape  than  the  exterior  form  indicates.  These  spaces  can  also  alter  spatial   Chapter 7  120   interconnections: stepping through the same door twice might not lead to the  same  virtual  space,  turning  around  might  not  lead  back  into  the  space  the  character just came from. The game Portal  Babbar et al. 2007  builds its core  gameplay principle around the question of entry and exit points of teleporta- tion “portals.”  Unlike  the  wrapping  space  of  Asteroids  or  Pac-Man  or  the  discontinuous  labyrinth of Adventure, the “impossible space” of Common Tales is not only a  functional gameplay feature but also part of the title’s dramatic and narrative  setting. There is a reason for their spatial behavior that goes beyond immediate  functionality. The higher level of complexity provided by the free camera and  the  larger  game  world  might  call  for  a  more  elaborate  explanation  of  the  impossible space or at least some form of contextualization. Like continuity  editing in ﬁ lm, this complexity can become a valuable arena for spatialized  narrative.  Continuity  can  be  applied,  broken,  or  played  with  to  enhance  certain qualities of a game.  One way to break this logic is via inconsistent spatial behavior of in-game  characters. So far, the teleporting of the main hero was used to connect places  and  provide  the  impression  of  one  continuous  world.  But  teleportation  can  also be used to break this illusion. In the survival horror game Fatal Frame  II: Crimson Sacriﬁ ce, some enemy ghosts can teleport themselves to different  positions within the game world. Such unpredictability destabilizes the play- er’s projection of events and raises the difﬁ culty level of any ﬁ ght. The player- character’s space itself stays intact, but the spatial behavior of enemies within  it becomes illogical. This affects the player’s perception of the environment.  In Fatal Frame II the player has to frantically scan the environment to ﬁ nd  the  teleported  ghosts  again,  who  could  literally  appear  from  any  direction.  Like Lynch’s Lost Highway, the spatial connections of the ﬁ ctional world are  out of balance. The game space becomes more insecure through the impossi- bility of spatial behavior. Until I have learned the teleportation patterns of  each  ghost  I  cannot  establish  a  stable  ﬁ ctional  framework  for  the  ghost’s  behavior. Moreover, my own character’s consistent spatial movement empha- sizes the mismatch.  More often, though, editing supports the creation of coherent space, even  if  there  is  none.  As  outlined  earlier,  this  copies  the  effects  of  continuity  editing.  It  rarely  ever  copies  the  diversity  of  this  visual  Hollywood  camera  technique, though.  While continuity between different shots in a traditional ﬁ lm is generated  with  an  elaborate  camera  work  that  often  combines  establishing  shots  of  a  location with more focused closeups of the actors and their relation within it,  games often remain on the level of the establishing shot, stringing one after   Cinema and Game Spaces  121   the  other  in  the  succession  of  one  game  location  to  the  next.  These  open  establishing  shots  have  their  value  for  the  presentation  of  the  game  space.  They keep the interactive options open by presenting a relatively large portion  of the game space. But how can we expand the montage of the game space  and add more virtual cameras to the expressive mix? The following paragraphs  will argue that more complex montage works especially when the editing is  driven by the player’s actions.  7.8  Interactive Montage  In interactive  montage  every  cut  is  initiated  by  the  player  and  is  an  essential  element of the gameplay. Strangely, montage as a play element has not been  developed from a ludic perspective at all. Yet it is here that event creation  through  interaction  and  cinematic  visualization  meet,  merge,  and  generate  new  effects.  Players  not  only  affect  events  inside  a  game  space  but  also  the  presentation of these events. Any “annihilation”  Eskelinen 2001a  of a discus- sion of moving image features in video games would be misleading. At the  same time, any approach based predominantly on ﬁ lm theory risks remaining  detached from game speciﬁ cs. Instead, the place in between the two poles is  seen as the most fruitful area for an argument. A range of possible interactive  montage elements can be found in this area; the complexity of Prince of Persia:  The Sands of Time or The Metal Gear Solid series grows from combinations of  system-driven and interactive montage. The following pages will refer back  to the initial distinction into four basic camera viewpoints to describe more  elaborate editing in game worlds.  7.8.1  Basic Matrix  The  four  initial  and  basic  camera  positions  have  been  deﬁ ned  as:  the  ﬁ rst- person point of view, following cameras  and related views such as over-the- shoulder cameras , overhead views  and related views such as isometric style ,  and  predeﬁ ned  viewing  frames   ﬁ xed  or  moving .  A  primitive  matrix  and  starting point for an analysis of interactive montage should start from these  basics.  Most of these cuts have been mentioned already but are here combined in  a basic matrix to illustrate the growing range in montage in games. There is  no limited list of possible cameras in ﬁ lm nor is there one for video games.  For the time being, this matrix is derived from the previously introduced basic  virtual camera distinctions in games. It is not a deﬁ nitive list of all visualiza- tion or editing methods in games. There are already various limitations for   Chapter 7  122   Table 7.1  First-person point of view  Following camera  Overhead view  Predeﬁ ned  viewing frames  First-person point of view  Following camera  Overhead view  Predeﬁ ned  viewing frames  GoldenEye 007 sniper  view  Siren “sight- jacking”  Doom map  view  Max Payne “bullet ride”  Metal Gear Solid “sneaking camera”  Age of Empires location jumping  Fatal Frame photo view  Prince of Persia scenic view  Incubation turn  execution  Resident Evil location jumping  such a matrix: these cameras are only referred to as visualizing the video game  space and do not include interface options outside this game space  such as  loading  screens ;  the  setup  does  not  exclude  but  neither  does  it  speciﬁ cally  develop the element of split-screens in games  e.g., map inlays ; and—as has  been outlined—all of these cameras have seen considerable developments that  blur  the  borderlines  between  them.  Many  of  the  following  examples  have  already been introduced but describe the basic matrix:   cid:2   First-person  point  of  view  to  ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view—example:  GoldenEye 007  Hollis and Mikell 1997  includes a sniper view that cuts from  a  ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view  to  a  zoomed-in  view  through  the  sniper  riﬂ e’s  scope. The cinematic pendant would be a zoom cut—a rare feature.  cid:2   Following camera to ﬁ rst-person point of view  and back —example: Siren  Toyama  2004   gives  access  to  multiple  ﬁ rst-person  perspectives  as  a  main  gameplay element through a “sight-jacking” feature. While the exploration  phases of the game are presented in a following camera style, sight jacking  allows the player to look through the eyes of the enemy creatures lurking in  the  dark  ready  to  kill  the  player-character.  Players  have  to  switch  between  these points of view, understand the levels and the dangers within each, and  create an escape strategy.  cid:2   Overhead  view  to  ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view   and  back —example:  in  DOOM,  the  seminal  ﬁ rst-person  shooter  combines  his  game  world  with  a  vector 2D map overview. Notably, the view is not merely representational as   Cinema and Game Spaces  123   the player stays in control of the avatar and can explore the world further. In  fact, ﬁ nding secret passages often depends on the map view.  cid:2   Predeﬁ ned  viewing  frames  to  ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view   and  back — example: the Fatal Frame series combines predeﬁ ned camera angles during the  exploration phase and user-triggered cuts to a ﬁ rst-person point of view during  the ﬁ ghting phase. In this case, the ﬁ rst-person viewpoint is motivated by the  game’s weapon: a photo camera.  cid:2   Following camera to following camera  and back —example: Max Payne’s “bullet ride” cuts from a following camera of the main hero to one of the last  deadly bullet ﬁ red in a ﬁ ght sequence. Although the bullet ride itself is not  under player control, the ﬁ nal shot triggered the cut, and only if the condition  of a successful hit is given is this special camera activated.  cid:2   Following  camera  to  overhead  view   and  back —example:  Metal  Gear  Solid’s camera is active whenever the hero hides behind walls. Large parts of  Metal Gear Solid are played in a kind of close-range overhead view that pro- vides  the  necessary  tactical  perspective  to  the  environments.  Whenever  the  hero comes close to a wall and crouches at it, the view changes to an alteration  of  a  following  camera  to  show  the  relationship  between  character  and  sur- rounding space in greater detail.  cid:2   Following  camera  to  predeﬁ ned  viewing  frames   and  back —example:  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time includes a scenic view of each location that  can be activated by the player at will, while the dominant presentation form  is in a following camera perspective. The player stays in control of the char- acter at all times.  cid:2   Overhead view to overhead view  and back —example: Age of Empires uses  an  inlay  overview  map  that  provides  interactive  access  to  a  jump  from  one  overhead view  the only available viewpoint toward the diegetic video game  world in this game  to the parallel view setup but onto another location of  the world. The cut can be tied to special locations  e.g., one’s central home  castle  and mapped to special keys.  cid:2   Overhead view to predeﬁ ned viewing frames  and back —Incubation: Time  Is  Running  Out   Nitsche  1997   is  a  turn-based  strategy  game  that  allows  players to plan their next turn in an overhead-like free-camera view. During  turn execution, though, the camera jumps to procedurally generated viewing  frames in the 3D world. While players lack any direct interactive access during  this turn execution, they are drawn closer into the game world by the camera  work and are visually repositioned from the role of an external general to that  of a participating ﬁ ghter.  cid:2   Predeﬁ ned  viewing  frames  to  predeﬁ ned  viewing  frames   and  back — example: Resident Evil, which triggers new cameras dependent on the player’s   Chapter 7  124   spatial  progress.  Every  location  has  at  least  one  predeﬁ ned  view  associated  with it that gets triggered when the player-avatar enters this zone.  7.8.2  Operation via Spatial Reinforcement  Although  the  visual  language  of  video  games  often  relates  to  cinematic  styles  it  is  obvious  that  very  few  of  these  editing  strategies  simply  copy  cinematic traditions. One basic difference is the repetitive nature of editing  in games.  There are cinematic parallels to every camera view previously outlined, but  few of these cinematic references apply them as rigorously and exclusively as  games do. For example, the bullet ride in Max Payne refers to the visualization  style  in  John  Woo  movies,  but  it  operates  not  as  a  rare  dramatization  and  peculiar high-pitched abstraction of the action scene but—over the course of  the game—as a repetitive signal for the end of many ﬁ ghts. The player will  see more bullet ride shots in Max Payne than in all of John Woo’s ﬁ lms com- bined. Likewise, the sniper riﬂ e view is present in cinema, and might be an  important  element  in  ﬁ lms  such  as  Enemy  at  the  Gates   Annaud  2001 ,  but  like Woo’s bullet ride, the ﬁ lm applies it as a rare peak in the visualization  of the event. In video games the sniper view might have a comparable effect,  taking  the  viewer  closer  to  the  target,  changing  the  speed  and  dramatic  tension level, and creating a visual intimacy with the victim, but it is also a  repetitive perspective encountered countless times in the course of the games  like Call of Duty and Quake.  So how does interactive montage with its cuts operate during gameplay?  And on what grounds does it add up to a consistent whole for the presentation  of the video game space?  Despite its rarity in ﬁ lm, the sniper riﬂ e cut became an instant classic and  omnipresent feature in ﬁ rst-person shooter games. On the one hand, this can  be attributed to the new function in the gameplay: the introduction of the  sniper riﬂ e with its different play options. On the other hand, on the visual- ization side, this is owing to the reinforcement of the player positioning in  the game space through the interactive cut. The sniping view reenforces the  position of a virtual character—that of the sniper. Through its visual concen- tration, it not only creates an intimacy with the target but also implies one  with the sniper. The cut therefore reinforces the position and orientation of  the player-character within the game space. It creates a close connection to  the play space of the interactor: whenever I activate a sniping view in a game,  I ﬁ nd myself at one end of the periscope. Accordingly, the cut builds on the  established  game  setup  and  becomes  accessible  in  return.  Interactive  access  and player positioning are applied and reinforced.  Cinema and Game Spaces  125   The same spatial reinforcement is at work in the Fatal Frame series. Again,  the game montage differs from cinematic traditions and might even contradict  or threaten established rules, but ultimately enforces the interactive experience  of the game space. The main gameplay sections of spatial exploration in Fatal Frame II are presented in predeﬁ ned viewing frames. In most cases it is during  these set perspectives that the player encounters an enemy. This establishes a  certain  axis  of  action,  namely  the  line  between  the  player-avatar  and  the  approaching enemy. The deﬁ ning visual element of Fatal Frame is the ability  of players to switch into ﬁ rst-person point of view at any moment, even if the  resulting  cut  threatens  the  basic  cinematic  prohibition  against  crossing  the  axis of action  Nitsche 2005c .  Whenever  I  activate  the  ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view  through  the  weapon  camera, I also trigger a cut to the character’s point of view and onto one point  of this axis. Depending on the avatar’s orientation, the result might be highly  disorienting.  The  whole  setup  is  far  from  Poole’s  “most  useful”  view  or  a  Pudovkin-like  optimized  observer  perspective   Pudovkin  1958 .  Instead,  it  can demand frenetic adjustment of the viewpoint to align to the axis of action  necessary to master the situation. This task becomes even more difﬁ cult due  to  minimal  lighting  and  lack  of  visual  landmarks,  as  well  as  the  necessary  timing  of  the  best  possible  shot  depending  on  the  enemy’s  behavior.  To  achieve the highest impact of my photo attack, I have to wait for a painfully  short shutter frame that differs between the various ghosts I encounter. Mas- tering the ﬁ rst-person point of view becomes and integral part of the game’s  functionality  and  gaming  experience,  comparable  to  mastering  the  move- ments of Lara Croft during her exploration of the levels in Tomb Raider or the  mastery of the weapons in Quake III: Arena  Devine, Carmack, and Cash 1999 .  Ultimately the cut does not violate the spatial continuity but instead operates  with it to enforce the player positioning and dramatize the game experience. DOOM’s 2D map exempliﬁ es the same reference to position and orienta- tion.  An  arrow  indicates  the  player-avatar’s  position  and  orientation  in  the  game space. Because the player stays in control of her avatar, DOOM allows  for a relatively seamless montage between the 3D ﬁ rst-person point of view  and the 2D map overview. Limited ﬁ eld of view, difﬁ cult orientation, bending  of basic cinematic rules, or minimalist 2D vector graphics do not lead to an  incomprehensible montage as long as the spatial continuity between point of  interactive access and cinematic visualization is guaranteed.  Instead  of  an  assembly  of  different  visual  attractors,  as  suggested  by  Eisenstein  1957 , the player-character position is the single most dominating  reference for these cuts’ efﬁ ciency. Because this character is under the player’s  control,  it  is  not  the  camera  that  guides  the  viewer  through  the  space   Chapter 7  126   but rather the player that guides the camera. How applicable are traditional  ﬁ lm  theories  to  the  features  of  interactive  montage  outlined  in  this  new  setting?  Elements  of  Bazin’s  realist  cinema  seem  to  be  closest  to  the  demands  of  such  an  interactive  montage.  In  particular,  his  demand  for  long  takes,  eye- level camera perspectives, and unobtrusive editing often also apply in games   1967 .  Such  a  reference  makes  sense  in  the  light  of  the  new  “reality”  that  gameplay constitutes, and its simultaneous visualization.  The reinforcement of the player positioning through interactive montage  has been identiﬁ ed as the key element for the evolving visual assembly. Inter- active access and spatial reinforcement are the joints around which this kind  of  interactive  montage  develops  and  forms  a  new  game  space.  Where  these  joints are threatened, the visualization can become illegible.  Siren  illustrates  that  these  references  cannot  be  taken  for  granted.  Using  multiple ﬁ rst-person points of view in combination with following cameras,  Siren asks players to orient themselves in the game world through complex  and  changing  visualizations.  The  game  includes  a  sight-jacking  option  that  allows the player to look through the eyes of the enemies in order to recognize  their position and behavior in the game world. The goal is to plan a secure  path through the enemy territory for players’ protagonists  shown mainly in  a following camera style . The problem is, whenever players sight-jack they  lose control over the spatial navigation. One might look through the eyes of  an enemy but the artiﬁ cial intelligence of this enemy still controls its move- ments and behavior. Instead of achieving a spatial reinforcement, the compre- hension of space is threatened. Neither the hero es  nor the enemies can be  directly controlled in that view. The visual result is less legible as the player  has difﬁ culty knowing through whose eyes the world is presented and where  this viewer is positioned or oriented. The weakening of the player positioning  makes  this  game  one  of  the  hardest  to  play  in  its  genre.  The  problems  of  playing Siren do not grow from the idea of sight-jacking—which was praised  by critics and players  see, e.g., www.metacritics.com —but from the difﬁ cul- ties in comprehending the montage as a consistent ﬁ ctional space. The inter- active  feature  was  laudable,  its  visual  implementation  too  demanding.  One  interpretation would be that Siren’s visualization is too advanced for today’s  players  and  that—with  improved  literacy  as  well  as  improved  graphical  quality—the  feature  might  become  more  accessible.  Interactive  access  and  spatial reinforcement might be temporary cornerstones for montage in games  as they—and their audiences—develop further.  Cinema and Game Spaces  127    8  Sound in Game Spaces  After the image and the image arrangement, audio stands out as the next domi- nant presentation form of video games. Our bodies hear before they see, and  acoustic signals are constituent parts of our understanding of our surroundings.  Not surprisingly, they are also part of our expectations of video game spaces.  Sound  guides  interactors  to  understand  the  game  events  and  to  construct  a  meaningful comprehension from the action. Although the use of sound may  have been primitive at ﬁ rst, it has been part of the game space since the earliest  days of Pong. It has always been a layer for evocative narrative elements. As with  the  virtual  camera,  there  is  no  “natural”  listening  position  in  a  video  game  space, but like the camera, the sound “tells” the space to the player. Sound  implies the position of a virtual listener in the game world and shifts the player  into that position. Any audible element has to be designed and implemented  in the game space to support the positioning of the player-listener. Like the  presentation of the visuals, this use of sound leads to a certain perspective.  In cinema, sound can guide the audience’s perception of the image and the  event, and as such it plays an important part in the diegesis of the perceived  ﬁ ctional world. This chapter describes how a comparable effect is achieved in  games through four different elements from sound effects to the overall mix.  Technically, video games can apply spatial sound, Dolby surround, and other  formats such as THX; they can deliver live sound broadcasts, sound playing  from  a  CD DVD Blu-ray,  sound  ﬁ ltering,  sound-generation,  and  real-time  mixing,  among  other  features.  Thanks  to  this  toolset,  sound  in  games  can  reach the acoustic quality of ﬁ lm, depending on the hardware of the speakers  and sound card. Four elements of sound in game spaces will be discussed in  the following chapters: effects, music, speech, and soundscapes.   8.1  Sound Effects  Sound effects have come a long way from the early titles such as Pong, which  featured the name-giving abstract sound effect; to the elaborate and multilay- ered sound design of modern computer games such as The Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers  Epps and Kojder 2002 . The latter claims to have 130 sounds  loaded into the PlayStation 2’s RAM at any moment during the game  Boyd  2003 . Their development toward ever more realistic soundscapes has been so  successful that some already call for a revision of the trend.  Opposing a tendency to extremely naturalistic sound sources, Poole calls for  less naturalistic and more artistic acoustic effects  2000, 80 . He envisions such  sound effects would work like the elaborate yet often highly abstract sound- scapes  of  David  Lynch’s  ﬁ lms.  At  the  same  time,  Poole  praises  the  limited  sound capabilities of early interactive titles, which forced designers to develop  unique and speciﬁ c sound effects rather than quote realistic sources, thereby  generating  something  entirely  new  that  suited  their  limited  capabilities   ibid., 80–84 . His argument strikes a chord, as those early limitations have  led to signature tunes and effects. The early phase of 8-bit video games was  extremely  limited  in  the  use  of  audiovisual  effects.  Sound-effects  design  in  landmark titles such as Miyamoto’s original Super Mario Bros. was limited but  became  famous,  even  genre-deﬁ ning.  Those  effects  have  been  referenced  in  other  media.  That  is  why  the  movie  Super  Mario  Bros.      Jankel  and  Morton  1993  quotes the distinctive sound style of the underlying video game, Super Mario Bros., in order to reference the ﬁ ctional world of the game. In this case,  the level of abstraction provided the necessary unique identity, which itself  does  not  simply  mimic  real-world  effects.  Marty  O’Donnell,  audio  director  for Bungie, argued for the sound design for Halo 2     J. Jones 2004 : “Real- sounding is not good. It’s just real. Real is boring. We want sound to be visceral”  Waugh 2005 . To achieve this visceral effect, there is also an argument for at  least associative realistic sound design that mimics physical sound sources and  behaviors. The recognizable sound of an artiﬁ cial waterfall adds signiﬁ cantly  to  the  sensual  quality  and  presence  of  its  visual  representation  in  virtual  space; the sound of a gunshot adds presence to an artiﬁ cial gun being ﬁ red; the  sound of a virtual car engine becomes much easier to read when it mimics real- world  behavior   see,  e.g.,  Rowland  2005 .  Exaggerating  these  sounds  can  emphasize  their  immediate  impact.  In  these  cases,  sound  not  only  helps  to  distinguish objects within space but also provides an association with a real  physical sound and allows for the projection and fast comprehension of the  simulated situation. This might support functionality; for example, the realis- tic sound of a virtual car in the Gran Turismo series can indicate the speed and   Chapter 8  130   condition of the vehicle and thus support the player’s comprehension of the  situation. At the same time, sound can create spaces. Like in ﬁ lm, where sound  “can  solicit  us  to  construct  space”   Bordwell  1985,  118   and  “personalize”   Bordwell, Staiger, and Thompson 1985, 54  this space, sound can characterize  virtual space and objects within it. Police cars are identiﬁ ed by their sirens in  ﬁ lms as well as in video game spaces  e.g., throughout the Grand Theft Auto series  and in the real, physical world.  The sirens have a dramatic, yet differently motivated impact in all three  worlds. However, they are all based on the real-world siren model. All three  use real-world references in the identity of a sound to simplify categorization.  As  objects  become  more  and  more  distinct,  game  spaces  can  become  more  cluttered. Thanks to this kind of sound-guided categorization, objects remain  legible, and surrounding space is easier to understand. Inﬂ uenced by Kevin  Lynch’s work on cognitive maps, Darken and Sibert introduced and tested an  “acoustic  landmark”   1993,  3   to  virtual  spaces.  Their  experimental  world  showed that the combination of visual and audio cues enhanced orientation  in  virtual  environments.  This  work  is  reinforced  by  other  ﬁ ndings  proving  the importance of spatial sounds in a virtual environment navigation system  for the blind  Loomis, Golledge, and Klatzky 1998  and Koh and colleagues  successfully included spatial sound in their tests of virtual spaces as simulators  for  spatial  training   Koh  et  al.  1999;  for  further  reference,  see  also  Loomis  et al. 2002 . These projects indicate how important the connection is between  spatial navigation in the visual 3D world and the sound world. Some games  use this connection and open the soundscape of a 3D game world to interac- tive exploration. The 3D video game Enemy Zero  Eno 1997  experiments with  this setup.  Once again I ﬁ nd myself trapped in an alien-infested spaceship. Whenever  I roam the corridors I explore the ship in a ﬁ rst-person point of view. But the  visuals will not help me during an alien attack because the enemy is invisible.  The only way to sense aliens is through an acoustic sensor device, modeled  after  motion-detection  devices  used  in  the  comparable  setting  of  Aliens  Cameron  1986 .  Any  enemy  in  front  produces  a  high  sound;  a  low  sound  indicates an enemy coming from behind; and mid-range sound indicates an  attack from the side. My relative position and orientation inside the virtual  spaceship directly impacts this perception. Through the soundscape, enemies  gain presence in relation to me, the player. In return, they increase the sense  of my spatial positioning and orientation within the game space.  But not all video games want to simplify the reading of the game space— auditory  or  visual.  Games  that  play  with  the  element  of  horror,  which  is  assisted by a certain dislocation of the player, can use the sound layer to cause   Sound in Game Spaces  131   deliberate  confusion.  The  highly  abstracted  and  expressive  sound  effects  of  DOOM 3  Willits 2004 , Silent Hill, or other horror titles already realize what  Poole called for: imaginative nonrealistic use of sound effects as artistic expres- sions. These games often use extremely distorted or reversed sound effects to  heighten  the  discomfort  of  the  player.  David  Lynch  used  the  technique  of  backward-played sound and action famously in the “red room” scenes of his  Twin  Peaks  series   Lynch  1990–1991 .  The  audience player  cannot  place  or  fully identify these kinds of distorted sound effects but is forced to try again  and again, as many of the other sounds  footsteps, closing doors, squeaking  ﬂ oors in Silent Hill; guns, explosions, technical machinery in DOOM 3  pull  the player back into a realistic frame. The conscious waging of one against  the other, the familiar against the incomprehensible, shapes the sound design  of  these  titles  and  forces  the  player  into  an  active-listener  position  that  becomes an integral part of a highly engaging experience. Silent Hill incorpo- rates this effect and integrates it into the game world itself. Early on in the  game, the player ﬁ nds a seemingly dysfunctional radio receiver that turns out  to be an important piece of virtual equipment. Like the alien-motion detector  in Enemy  Zero,  the  radio  operates  as  an  acoustic  enemy  detector  and  emits  white noise whenever enemies are nearby. The effect is enhanced by limited  sight as the game often uses fog or light effects to restrict visuals. But white  noise itself is deﬁ ned as an equal use of all frequencies, and a listener cannot  distinguish  any  single  sound  in  a  white  noise  signal.  The  effect  is  that  the  player of Silent Hill is forced to concentrate on a basically incomprehensible  sound  effect  to  deal  with  the  game  world.  It  is  a  very  effective  trap  in  the  form of presentation. But even if the sound object is less obvious than seen  in Silent  Hill,  the  player  cannot  escape,  for  as  O’Donnell  argues:  “The  eye  blinks when you turn your head to look at something else, but the ear never  blinks. We are working hard with the programmers to make certain that there  are no seams in the soundtrack—no moments of dead silence that will break  the spell of the sense of place”  1997, 638 .  O’Donnell  acknowledges  the  importance  of  sound  to  create  a  “sense  of  place”—here  in  the  context  of  the  game  Riven   Miller  and  Vander  Wende  1997 . This points back to sound as part of the telling of a space and high- lights its value for a player’s immersion in the ﬁ ctional world. As Darken and  colleagues discovered while looking for quantitative measures of presence in  virtual  environments:  “for  most  mainstream  applications,  sound  should  be  considered  an  essential  component”   Darken  et  al.  1999,  13 .  Indeed,  its  absence usually causes irritation.  Any visible rain effect without the appropriate sound has to appear unnatu- ral to an interactor, just as movements without the sound of footsteps or forests   Chapter 8  132   that bar any audible birds leave an eerie feeling of artiﬁ ciality. Sound effects  are part of a virtual world’s identity and they dramatize the individual object  in the virtual space as well as the position of a listener within this space. As  a  result,  spatial  comprehension  and  dramatic  contextualization  are  essential  tasks of sound effects in video games.  8.2  Music  As Goldman wrote: “Music in ﬁ lm mediates. Its nonverbal and nondenotative  status allows it to cross all varieties of ‘borders’: between levels of narration   diegetic nondiegetic ,  between  narrating  agencies   objective subjective  nar- rators ,  between  viewing  time  and  psychological  time,  between  points  in  diegetic  space  and  time   as  narrative  transition .  Finally,  the  connotative  values which music carries, via cultural codes and also through textual repeti- tion and variation, in conjunction with the rest of the ﬁ lm’s soundtrack and  visuals, largely determine atmosphere, shading, expression, and mood”  1987,  30; italics in original .  Music operates as a powerful but often hidden mediation tool  Lack 1997 .  Chatman even argues when watching a ﬁ lm “if we started listening to the score,  it would probably mean that we had lost interest in the narrative”  1990, 9;  italics in original . Like ﬁ lms, video game titles use specially composed and  produced soundtracks to support the setting and evocative narrative elements.  Trent  Reznor  is  one  example  of  an  artist  crossing  the  boundaries  between  media.  He  is  a  musician  in  the  worlds  of  commercial  music  with  his  band  Nine Inch Nails, ﬁ lm music, and game audio. In 1996 he collaborated not  only with Lynch to produce the soundtrack for Lost Highway but also with id  Software as video game music producer, when he composed the entire score  and  the  effects  of  the  original  Quake.  Reznor’s  industrial  sound  has  left  its  mark on both pieces.  Even where the sound quality of ﬁ lm or television is not matched, musical  motifs  can  still  transcend,  from  ﬁ lm  to  video  game,  and  connect  both.  The  original Star  Wars   Lucas  1977   soundtrack  composed  by  John  Williams  is  included in many franchise computer games, including Star Wars: TIE Fighter  Holland and Kilham 1994 . Here, the reappearance of the ﬁ lm’s soundtrack  is of obvious inferior quality, but the recognizable musical pattern provides a  unifying element between the ﬁ lm and the computer game. Players familiar with  the ﬁ lm expect a certain ﬁ ctional world to be connected to this soundtrack and  are preconditioned to read the game as such. This expectation transcends media  and can be used for dramatic purposes in the ﬁ ctional virtual worlds. It also indi- cates the value of music in games for the creation of a context or atmosphere.  Sound in Game Spaces  133   Combining  the  music  with  the  moving  image  to  set  the  atmosphere  is  more complex in games than in ﬁ lm. While the latter allows a picture-perfect  match to the photographed action, games allow users to change the timing  of events, demanding an immediate reconstruction of the musical score. That  is why Myst III: Exile’s  Saunder 2001  linear main orchestral scores are used  only in the prerendered video sequences, where no interactive access is granted   Wall 2002 . In games players decide what happens, where, when, and how.  It is not easy for the musical score to predict, foreshadow, or support the event  and  set  the  necessary  atmosphere.  Bessel  even  argues  that  “too  literal  an  attempt to adhere to ﬁ lm-music practice seems at the moment to be restrict- ing  innovation  in  this  area”   2002,  142 .  With  reference  to  the  serialized  musical approach of Boulez, Bessel praises the musical score of Alien Trilogy  Nagy, Michael, and Shea 1996  consisting of two independent sound loops  that combine to unexpected results and form this title’s background score. He  suggests that their changing sound combinations work in a “more successfully  ﬁ lmic  manner”   2002,  139   than  the  linear,  and  clearly  Danny  Elfman- inspired score of Medievil 2  Shepherd 2000 , composed by Andrew Barnabas  and Paul Arnold. It should be added, both composers were clearly aiming to  achieve an Elfman-esque ﬁ lm score, so the result is by no means accidental.  Both titles represent different philosophies in game music. How to balance  those poles? What are the expressive means of music for video game spaces  and  how  can  it  incorporate  the  element  of—especially  spatial—interaction  and exploration?  Some games depend on a combination of music and interaction: rhythm  games let players participate in the event on the acoustic layer. In this very  successful genre the order is reversed. The player has to follow the music in  games such as the Dance Dance Revolution series, Donkey Konga  Endo 2004 ,  or Guitar Hero  LoPiccolo and Kay 2005 . Players follow a set of given patterns  that are displayed largely independently from the surrounding visuals. They  usually follow the z-axis into the screen, as in Guitar Hero; the screen’s hori- zontal x-axis, as in Donkey Konga; or the screen’s vertical y-axis, as in Dance Dance  Revolution.  But  the  patterns  have  little  connection  to  other  graphics  displayed  on  screen.  The  surrounding  space  of  the  image  and  the  game  world  can  be  reduced  to  eye  candy  as  only  the  simpliﬁ ed  track  of  music  drives  the  action  forward.  Many  of  these  rhythm  games  feature  ingenious  interfaces   dance  mats,  guitars,  bongos,  maracas,  microphones,  drumsticks   that  shape  the  play  space  but  are  limited  in  their  impact  on  the  virtual  space in the game. The interfaces are so specialized for musical purposes that  other  forms  of  interaction  like  navigation  and  camera  control  are  reduced.   Chapter 8  134   When these interfaces lack the direct appeal of the tangible “real world”—as  in Amplitude  LoPiccolo 2003 —the result is far less engaging.  Amplitude—a direct predecessor to the far more successful Guitar Hero— included a range of features that would help make Guitar Hero so successful.  Among other things, it featured rhythm units as visual cues approaching the  player, to be reacted to. But Amplitude’s game space stayed highly abstract and  the  play  space  remained  less  activated  due  to  the  controller  used.  While  Amplitude  used  the  default  Sony  PlayStation  controller,  Guitar  Hero  invades  the play space with a physical model guitar as interface. The PlayStation 2  version of Space Channel 5: Part 2  Mizuguchi 2003  uses the same physical  controller as Amplitude but the directions here are less abstract and are local- ized  in  a  ﬁ ctional  space,  namely  an  alien-infested  space  station.  Instead  of  abstracted symbols arranged along a single axis, they consist of the four direc- tions up, down, left, and right, and a “chu” command that occasionally indi- cates a “forward.”  When playing the game I ﬁ nd myself in control of Ulala, the disco-queen- like space reporter. Ulala faces hordes of space aliens that need to be defeated  in dance battles to proceed in the game. Dance battles start with the aliens  presenting  a  form  of  dance  instructions.  Once  the  instructions  are  given,  I  have to control Ulala to follow them in the beat of the song. The situation is  not unlike an aerobics session or dance lesson in virtual space: I try to repeat  the  rhythm  and  dance  pattern  correctly  and  Ulala  dances  a  response  to  the  alien invaders. Once a dance battle is won, Ulala proceeds to the next event.  Aliens and heroine share a continuous dancing space. This spatial grounding  ties the player more to the in-game world than the single-axis interaction in  other rhythm games. Movements are localized dance steps of the virtual char- acter. Still, I remain a slave to the rhythm.  In the case of Myst III: Exile, Wall addressed the problem of user-dependent  tempo and cue moments by composing one type of music for predeﬁ ned scenes  with no interactive access and another for the interactive moments of the in- game  events   Wall  2002 .  This  is  an  approach  taken  by  many  game  music  composers but it separates the cutscene sections from the interactive ones. In  Myst  III:  Exile,  in-game  music  playing  during  user-interaction  is  generated  by a special audio engine developed by Roland Gustafsson. Generative systems  like  this  one,  Microsoft’s  DirectMusic,  LucasArt’s  older  iMuse  system,  or  SSEYO’s KOAN X offer a dynamic change of a playing musical piece in rela- tion to the user’s interaction. With the help of these “adaptive audio” systems  composers can prearrange rules that deﬁ ne the “scoring” of the ﬁ nal musical  score in relation to the events  Whitmore 2003, 1 .  Sound in Game Spaces  135   A  change  of  the  background  music  in  Star  Wars:  TIE  Fighter,  which  uses  the  iMuse  system,  becomes  a  signal  for  growing  danger  immediately  before  the  enemies  will  start  another  attack.  This  references  the  use  of  tension  music  in  many  ﬁ lms,  including  the  Star  Wars  franchise,  but  it  not  only calls for heightened attention it also allows the player to prepare for the  battle. The possible downside is that the music turns into an interface signal  and loses some of its impact as a unique musical performance, not unlike the  repetitive use of dramatic camera angles in games outlined before. Due to the  distinct  motif  of  the  musical  piece,  the  clip  loses  its  value  as  a  piece  of  a  powerful but almost hidden tool  as outlined by Chatman for ﬁ lm music , and  it  becomes  more  of  a  foreground  sound  effect.  Like  the  motion  detector  of  Enemy  Zero  or  the  radio  of  Silent  Hill,  the  tension  music  of  Star  Wars:  TIE  Fighter is a kind of enemy detector. Two things differ, though: using music  for such a task means that certain musical motifs remain legible  in contrast,  for example, to the white noise of the radio in Silent Hill  and in this instance  the music is nondiegetic. While the player-character has to be equipped with  the  necessary  virtual  tools  for  acoustic  enemy  detection  in  Enemy  Zero  and  Silent Hill, the music of Star Wars: TIE Fighter has no in-game representation.  This, once more, quotes cinematic traditions but does not necessarily support  the spatial qualities of the game. Orientation or position will not change the  music, for example. The music is in danger of turning into a repetitive audio  feedback,  comparable  to  the  beeps  of  an  operating  system  that  conﬁ rm  a  certain selection or operation. Although the acoustic signal can be a musical  score  quoted  from  cinematic  sources,  it  is  signiﬁ cantly  different  from  ﬁ lm music.  An example of a hybrid of diegetic and nondiegetic use of music is Clock- tower 3  Sadamoto 2002 . The game is a survival horror title and includes a  level staged in 1942 London that is thematically centered on the death of a  young pianist. Not only is the sound of the piano playing used in the cutscene- like  transition  phase  into  this  speciﬁ c  level,  but  players  also  hear  it  during  navigation through the world and might assume that this is the speciﬁ c level’s  musical theme. But it turns out to be more than that. In order to proceed in  the level, players have to enter the theater and see the pianist playing. The  main mystery of this level, aptly titled A Little Night Music, revolves around  the death of just this young pianist. At that moment, the sound that overlaid  most  parts  of  the  level  exploration  is  reframed  as  diegetic.  The  result  is  a  meaningful  and  dense  soundscape  that  invites  the  player’s  imagination—it  asks quite literally who the pianist might be and what her fate is. Whenever  the playing stops, the player is to act accordingly. The music actively shapes  players’ ﬁ ctional planes of the game world.  Chapter 8  136   Other games, such as Grand Theft Auto III use a more traditional approach.  Grand Theft Auto III gives players access to a range of predeﬁ ned musical scores  within the same game space. In the case of Grand Theft Auto III, these scores  are made available through the interface abstraction of a virtual car radio from  which players can choose their personal favorite station. Unlike the Star Wars:  TIE Fighter soundtrack, the music becomes a diegetic part of the game world.  Each  station  represents  a  certain  mood  and  lifestyle:  there  are  cynical  chat  shows and urban hip hop, country, and classic rock channels among others.  The predeﬁ ned style of each virtual radio station allows for a subtle charac- terization  of  the  objects  and  locations  within  the  world.  The  initial  radio  channel  projects  certain  cultural  connotations,  some  of  which  might  be  reduced  to  archetypical  clichés,  but  they  still  add  dimension  to  the  game  space. Whether it is a talk show, a classic music channel, or an R&B station,  the player gets a glimpse into the background of the car just hijacked and its  former  driver.  That  the  player  is  capable  of  switching  stations  is  another  element of the carjacking and possibly the ﬁ nal sign of their new ownership.  However,  if  we  accept  music  as  an  important  element  for  the  mood  of  an  event, and mood as an inﬂ uential element that shapes our perception, then  the multiple stations of Grand Theft Auto III can also be reinterpreted as ﬁ lters  through which the player’s mood and thus her perception of the game space  are shaped. The radio stations are valuable forms of music implementation in  games precisely because they are not adaptive but preset repetitive loops. In  a next step, sequels to the game  and game modiﬁ cations  allowed players to  create own channels. Allowing the player to include a custom-made channel,  then, is nothing else but the provision for an individual’s own “ﬁ lter” in the  simpliﬁ ed form of a music collection. The player has entered the game world  on  the  level  of  musical  construction  and  includes  his  or  her  own  cultural  background into the game world. This leads to a new role for the player in  the actual creation of music.  The user triggers music generation in titles such as Rez  Yamada 2001  or  the Quake III modiﬁ cation q3apd  Oliver and Pickles 2003 . Here, the user’s  interactions and or the non-player characters’ behavior call and arrange sound  effects  that  form  the  evolving  musical  soundtrack.  They  add  an  interactive  layer to the formation of the musical score. Notably, these titles have highly  abstracted visuals to concentrate on the soundscape.  Through this interactive layer, the system-controlled loops already men- tioned in reference to the Alien Trilogy have become available to the interactor  and can be rearranged in new ways. As the player’s input ultimately assembles  the soundtrack, its timing and rhythm is highly sensitive to the user’s actions.  Music, in these examples, is an essential part of the gameplay and cannot be   Sound in Game Spaces  137   Figure 8.1 Rez  left  and q3apd  right : examples of highly abstracted game spaces with a  focus on visual effects and audio  conﬁ ned to a layer of presentation somehow distant from the main interaction.  Rather, it can connect event to event and events to meaning, and encourage  users to understand this meaning within the virtual space, just as ﬁ lm music  “bonds:  shot  to  shot,  narrative  event  to  meaning,  spectator  to  narrative”   Gorbman  1987,  55 .  Music  and  the  player’s  interaction  with  it  become  essential for the creation and development of the game space. This is a parallel  to the empowerment of the player in regard to the virtual camera, as discussed  in  chapter  7.  If  players  in  that  scenario  turned  into  camera  operators,  here  they become composers and DJs.  In fact, Oliver’s Fijuu project  Oliver and Pickles 2004  and Fijuu 2  Oliver  and Pickles 2006  is exactly this: a DJ mixing table in the form of a 3D space,  where loops are spatial tracks and sounds correspond to distractions of virtual  objects—all controlled by a PlayStation gamepad. Music and space manipula- tion have merged into new forms of virtual instruments that are distorted and  twisted to form new sounds.  8.3  Speech  Harrison and Dourish argue that “the audio space is truly shared; we each speak  and hear in the same audio space. The sound of my voice carries over the audio  connection and invades your space”  1996, 73; italics in original . Their state- ment already emphasizes the value of speech in a shared sound environment.  Our conversations are localized events that undergo changes in the voice in  direct connection to their spatial staging. Instead of projecting the sound gen- eration into the play space—as seen in Guitar Hero—the sounds are generated  de facto in the play space and projected into the virtual environment.  Chapter 8  138   Speech  ﬁ lls  video  game  spaces  as  prerecorded,  computer-generated,  or  transmitted live from other players. Prerecorded speech is the dominant form  in practical game implementations as well as in advanced experimental games  such  as  the  immersive  interactive  drama  piece  Façade  by  Mateas  and  Stern   2005 . Façade stages the domestic quarrels of a couple around an interactor  staged as an old friend visiting at the wrong time. The interactor can move  around in the couple’s apartment and communicate with them via text input,  to which the virtual characters reply via audio output. All the audio available  to  the  characters  is  prerecorded   Mateas  2002 .  The  prerecorded  speech  becomes  a  major  part  of  the  character’s  expressive  behavior  together  with  animations,  facial  expressions,  and  movements  in  space.  It  also  becomes  a  major part of the production process. Creating sound recordings to cover each  possible situation is a Herculean task and quickly can prove to be unfeasible  under commercial conditions.  That  is  one  reason  why  speech  and  sound  effects  blur  in  Warcraft:  Orcs  and  Humans  or  speech  is  reduced  to  gibberish  in  The  Sims  series.  Warcraft uses grunting vocal acknowledgements from its virtual characters whenever  the user activates them with a mouse click. Speech transforms into a sound  effect  in  a  highly  abstracted  way,  as  an  interface  element  to  acknowledge  the  user  interaction.  Limited  and  abstracted  as  this  approach  might  be  in  contrast  to  a  performing  intelligible  virtual  actor   as  in  Façade ,  it  still  adds character to the virtual ﬁ gure as well as a certain feel to the overall title.  For example, a virtual human will respond differently from a virtual orc or  ogre  in  Warcraft  and  the  range  of  different  sounds  adds  an  overall  level  of  humor to the original Warcraft that was dearly missed in later installments.  An  even  higher  level  of  abstraction  can  be  found  in  the  voices  of  the  sim  characters in The Sims  Wright et al. 2000 . All voices of the sim characters  morph into sound effects that still carry emotional tension without conveying  any meaningful dialog. Such a conversion allows the game to represent emo- tional states in the performance of the speech and to disregard the details of  what speciﬁ cally is being spoken. The Sims can entirely concentrate on style  not on content of the voice. A reduction of speech to effect, thus, can enhance  expressiveness.  In contrast to the repetitive battle music in Star Wars: TIE Fighter, each  entity  in  the  ﬁ rst  Warcraft  installations  offers  a  range  of  acoustic  responses  that are fast and stylish. Because players constantly select different entities,  each with a range of different replies, the result is a familiar soundscape, but  a  constantly  changing  realization  of  it.  Instead  of  becoming  repetitive  and  annoying, players can ﬁ nd themselves experimenting with this feature alone  and testing the range and quality of the responses.  Sound in Game Spaces  139   Meanwhile,  speech  generation  still  has  limited  expressive  quality.  The  massively multiplayer online chat world Cybertown  n.n. 1995–  uses a non- spatial text-to-speech voice generation in a 2D 3D chat world. Although the  visitor to Cybertown can chose from a set of voices, the lack of emotion and  the  impersonal  results  of  the  speech  generation  are  apparent  and  confusing  given the often very personal and intimate conversations in these chat worlds.  In addition, the voices end up on a ﬂ attened soundscape that does not support  the game space and stays unconnected to it. Other sounds in the virtual world  of Cybertown can be spatialized, and the confusion between the two forms leads  to  mixed  signals  from  the  acoustic  level  instead  of  collaboration  toward  a  uniﬁ ed  sound  experience.  At  the  same  time,  the  visual  presentation  of  the  Cybertown world can be either 2D or 3D, with an extra chat window operating  in both interfaces.  Voice over Internet Protocol is less restricted. Players can transmit vocal  messages  to  each  other  using  technology  like  GameSpy’s  Roger  Wilco  or  Microsoft’s  Xbox  Live  network.  It  is  up  to  the  user  what  is  said,  when,  to  whom,  and  how.  Consequently,  voice  transmission  has  more  in  common  with a live telephone conference than with directed cinematic mediation. It  allows  a  highly  interactive  and  unpredictable  variety  of  possible  genuinely  interactive expressions that cannot be adjusted by the designer to ﬁ t into a  dramatic order. Not everyone welcomed such an invasion of the “real” into  the virtual world. In 2003 Richard Bartle ranted against the implementation  of  Voice  over  IP  in  role-playing  games.  He  argued  it  would  be  too  early  to implement them in massively multiplayer online role-playing games pre- cisely because it would project the “real” into the “virtual”: “Adding reality  to a virtual world robs it of what makes it compelling—it takes away that  which  is  different  between  virtual  worlds  and  the  real  world:  the  fact  that  they are not the real world. Voice is reality”  Bartle 2003 . While it might be  a difﬁ cult design decision how to incorporate the voice  e.g., Wadley, Gibbs,  and  Benda  2005 ,  canceling  the  option  entirely  seems  too  extreme  and  a  general tendency is heading more in the opposite direction. Designers of the  massively  multiplayer  online  world  Second  Life  added  a  spatialized  speech  feature that mimics proximity in the sound transmission. It is not only a visual  but  also  an  acoustic  character  representation.  The  soundscape  connects  the  play space of the individual player to the mediated space of the game repre- sentation. This supports the social networking and communication in Second Life and opens up new forms of interaction, such as a less rigid form of virtual  theater, for example.  In comparison, another feature unique to the speech layer is rarely used in  games:  Chion’s  “acousmêtre.”  The  acousmêtre  is  deﬁ ned  as  a  voice  that  is   Chapter 8  140   “neither inside nor outside the image”  Chion 1994, 129  and that has “the  power of seeing all; second, the power of omniscience; and third, the omnipotence to act on the situation  .  .  .  [and] in many cases there is also the gift of ubiq- uity—the acousmêtre seems to be able to be anywhere he or she wishes”  ibid.,  129–130; italics in original . Films often apply this feature, for example in  the voice of the computer HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey  Kubrick 1968 . Its  use for video games is promising and only partially exploited. Titles such as  Max Payne or Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time have the inner voice of the  main character narrate the situation back to the player. But this is far from  realizing the full power of the acousmêtre—serving as the voice of the game  system itself would better fulﬁ ll its potential. A simple example is the “game’s  voice”  in  Unreal  Tournament  2004  that  proclaims  outstanding  game  perfor- mances to every player in the session. In that case, speech reaches into the last  of the ﬁ ve planes: the rule-based plane. But the expressive range and especially  depth is rather limited from the grunted announcement of a “double kill” to  the ecstatic “ultra kill.” The use of speech has many parallels to that of music:  it  interconnects  different  spatial  planes  and  is  a  powerful  force  for  spatial  reenforcement  as  well  as  expression  within  the  game  space.  In  the  form  of  Voice over IP it provides a very simple and effective input option that draws  the play space further into the virtual world. Thus, it is a genuine force to  interconnect the various planes that deﬁ ne the video game space.  8.4  Soundscapes  Ultimately, sound effects, music, and speech have to be combined into one  consistent, overall soundscape that has qualities of its own such as balance and  timing between the different elements and their relation to the moving image.  One key element in this balance is the use of on- or off-screen sound.  Synchronizing off-screen sound with the image “is as basic to the syntax  of sound ﬁ lm as the eye-line match or the shot reverse-shot sequence”  Buhler  2001, 46 . It is also a crucial element of the continuity of video game spaces,  where the visible world extends into the audible, and where audio cues give  indications  of  the  virtual  space  ahead.  The  resulting  navigable  soundscapes  are a crucial element of the acoustic composition as they form a kind of mise- en-bande—a term established by Altman for ﬁ lm  ibid., 55  but easily transfer- able to video games. While a cinematic mise-en-bande is a linear guidance for  the audience, the soundscapes of games are ﬂ exible. A player’s spatial explora- tion is also a journey through a varying soundscape. Mixing any element of  the mise-en-bande for a video game has to take this level of user interaction into  consideration.  It  is  dynamic  and  has  to  be  aware  that  any  off-screen  sound   Sound in Game Spaces  141   source might be any moment in the audible ﬁ eld, depending on the player’s  interaction. The play between visible and invisible, audible and silent, visible  and silent, and invisible and audible is part of the game world experience and  offers countless possibilities for evocative narrative elements.  Elaborate  soundscapes  can  build  up  a  dramatic  foreshadowing,  provide  direct acoustic engagement up to the climax, and mark an end with a cathartic  aftermath. The sound design of DOOM 3 applies this in all its mastery. Chris- tian Antkow is credited with the sound design for DOOM 3 but Trent Reznor  was involved once more, this time in the sound design of the game’s earlier  released demo.  In DOOM 3 I steer a lonely space marine in a ﬁ rst-person point of view  through a scary and hostile 3D world. Along the way I often trigger certain  events,  usually  through  sheer  proximity  to  an  invisible  trigger  zone.  These  are not only visual events that call for interaction—usually monsters jumping  from the shadows that need dealing with—but also sounds. These sounds can  include  nondiegetic  music,  in-game  sound  effects,  or  diegetic  speech  from  other characters seemingly active in the same haunted space station—often in  their moments of death. Without directly changing my own actions or range  of interactions, these sounds draw me deeper into the frightening game space.  They are like a trail of breadcrumbs luring me into the setting and into the  game world. The very elaborate soundscape is forced upon me, for I cannot  avoid or cut short the transmission of death screams and futile rescue attempts  of my fellow space marines. The voice recording is exceptional for video game  standards and the grueling effects truly make me scared of the road ahead. I  am  primed  to  expect  the  worst,  as  the  foreshadowing  of  deadly  events  is  evident in their acoustic presence. But as much as I would like to avoid this  stressful situation, I have to pay attention to every possible sound source to  survive. Lighting is often reduced to levels that make enemies recognizable  only through their grunts, so I ﬁ nd myself navigating the twisted darkness  relying to a great extent on sound cues.  Like many other titles, DOOM 3 uses highly energizing musical pieces to  dramatize key enemy encounters, but they are only part of a larger soundscape  evolving  from  all  the  different  sources.  Once  the  frantic  ﬁ ght  breaks  loose,  explosions, cries, weapons ﬁ re, footsteps, and music blend into an overwhelm- ing soundscape. The panic and visual as well as acoustic overload of a well- timed attack then breaks away and the end of the ﬁ ght lets me fall back into  the silence of the mainly deserted game world. This change in the mise-en-bande provides an almost tangible relief before the eeriness of the silence starts to  creep back in and tension builds once more.  Chapter 8  142   As  with  interactive  montage  and  performing  cameras,  we  see  that  space  and  its  exploration  implies  an  empowerment  of  the  player  over  traditional  concepts—in this case of sound arrangement. A single prefabricated mix of a  soundscape is close to useless in a 3D video game that demands a ﬂ exible and  spatially rooted sound design of all the interconnected elements. The dynamic  positioning of the listener is not an option but a fundamental design decision,  just like the camera’s perspective. Both are examples of a narrative positioning  in 3D video game worlds; both tell space and situate within it.  Although the positions of the camera and the listener have been outlined  as  important  elements  for  this  telling,  they  do  not  necessarily  have  to  be  the  same.  Like  many  car  racing  games,  Colin  Mcrae  Rally  3   Osbourn  and  Lowes  2002   offers  different  viewpoints  during  the  main  gameplay:  in  a  ﬁ rst-person  perspective  inside  the  car  or  “on  the  hood,”  or  in  a  following  third-person  perspective  behind  the  car,  but  the  listener’s  position  remains  the same. The player’s visual position thus differs from his acoustic position.  Rowland  argues  from  his  practical  experience  “that  the  listener  should  be  situated  to  enhance  the  feeling  of  immersion  rather  than  to  reinforce  the  viewpoint  of  the  camera”   2005,  7 .  The  player’s  positioning  in  relation  to the game event is thus divided into acoustic and visual. There is a distance  between the two that, in this case, is used to maintain continuous immersion.  The point is not whether Rowland is right—other racing games apply sound  in  different  ways—but  that  his  argument  points  to  higher  complexity  on  the level of the mediated plane. The separation into visual and acoustic per- spectives can be applied to actively shape the ﬁ ctional plane in other games,  such as survival horror or sports. While the generation of a soundscape con- centrated mainly on synchronization between sound and image to support the  creation  of  the  video  game  space,  the  distance  between  visual  and  auditory  level within an interactive setting allows sound to become a counterpoint to  the moving image.  Film sound has seen the call for a more independent use of the sound level,  a  “counterpoint”   Buhler  2001,  45,  referring  to  Brecht  and  Eisler’s  use  of  music . Even Chion sees no “natural and preexisting harmony between image  and sound”  1994; see Murch on xvii . Both meet to achieve certain effects in  ﬁ lm  but  are  free  to  separate  whenever  they  want  to.  The  use  of  music  in  Clocktower 3 stands out as one use of this division in video games, and many  other  games  from  Halo  2  to  Second  Life  recognize  the  value  of  a  complex  soundscape for the telling of their spaces. However, it remains an area ripe  for  more  exploration.  For  the  creation  of  a  soundscape  this  division  can  be  diversiﬁ ed:  sounds,  music  and  speech  can  all  generate  different  acoustic   Sound in Game Spaces  143   perspectives that can be dynamically rearranged in their relation to the event  and its visual presentation. The video game space can involve the player on  multiple perspective layers at the same time. The mediated plane gains new  facets  that  can  be  assembled  into  a  more  complex  network,  playing  with  diverse positioning of the interactor in relation to the game world. The acous- tic telling of space in modern video games has become highly elaborate, not  to simulate realistic worlds but to evoke dramatic game locations.  Chapter 8  144   9  Effects of Narrative Filters  Both visualization and soundscapes point to the generation of a complex nar- rative  perspective  toward  a  narrated  event  created  by  the  presentation.  The  narrative perspective emerges from the available interactive options, but also  from the way the space is told to the player. The mediated plane works like  a narrative ﬁ lter between the rule-based plane and the play space. This narra- tive perspective is not derived from a general claim that all games tell stories  but that all 3D games tell space and players comprehend the space and the  way it is populated with evocative elements as a contextualized ﬁ ctional space.  It  is  a  consequence  of  the  games’  spatiality.  All  3D  video  games  that  offer  interactive and navigable game worlds contain this narrative element.  The following section will argue that the narrative perspective opens up  layers of guidance through focalization in games. For 3D games, these are not  optional add-ons but ever-present effects in 3D game spaces.  Genette  1980  introduced many helpful tools that have been applied by  games researchers. One of them is the distinction into “who tells” and “who  sees.” Mieke Bal developed the concept of focalization from this division and  expanded  it  beyond  written  texts  into  other  formats,  including  bas-reliefs,  movies, and pictures. Because Bal includes visual storytelling, her approach  applies more directly to 3D video games and is used here. Bal deﬁ nes focaliza- tion  as  “the  relationship  between  the  ‘vision,’  the  agent  that  sees,  and  that  which is seen”  1997, 146 . “That which is seen” constitutes the action and  the objects involved in it; “the agent that sees” is the focalizer. These focalizers  take different forms and shapes. “The subject of focalization, the focalizer, is  the  point  from  which  the  elements  are  viewed.  That  point  can  lie  with  a  character   i.e.,  it  can  be  an  element  of  the  fabula ,  or  outside  it”   ibid. .    Consequently,  Bal  distinguishes  between  the  character-bound  focalizer  and  the external focalizer; others refer to the same division as internal and external  focalization  Onega and Landa 1996 . The complexity of today’s game pre- sentation, as it has been outlined, allows for both forms and combinations of  them, which open up a wide range of options in the arrangement of the evoca- tive narrative elements.  9.1  Focalization in Games  In the beginning and throughout Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time  Mechner  2003 , the character of the Prince is established ﬁ rmly as the narrator as well  as the main hero of the events. He “tells” the predeﬁ ned linear storyline as a  ﬂ ashback. This limits the possibility space to such an extent that his narration  can oppose and reject in-game actions realized by the player if they do not  comply with his “memories.” For example, whenever the player fails and yet  another virtual death stops the Prince in his progress, the Prince’s voice might  inform us, “That didn’t happen.” The narrator contradicts the just-actualized  event. In order to succeed in the game, the player has to perform the memories  of the Prince. The game leaves it open how to perform them but binds the  player  to  the  linear  string  of  events  as  dictated  by  the  Prince’s  memories.  Leaving this memory trail or failing the puzzles and ﬁ ghts along the way are  not viable options  see also Rhody 2005 .  While the acoustic telling grows from an internal perspective, the camera,  the  focalizer  that  “sees”  these  events  is  external.  The  game  features  a  ﬁ rst- person point of view option but in this view no interaction is allowed except  looking  around.  The  dominating  view  is  a  player-controlled  version  of  the  following camera. As described above, the game can also ﬁ x cameras in space  to  enforce  a  certain  perspective  and  offers  ﬁ xed,  predeﬁ ned  viewing  planes.  Like a visual help function, these cameras direct and focus attention on the  pathway through the current game space. They tell the space and the path  through  it,  they  position  the  hero’s  and  ultimately  the  player’s  quest.  This  camera work is predominantly that of an external focalizer.  Like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, the game Max Payne works from  the premise of a memory ﬂ ashback. Starting at the end of the game’s ﬁ ctional  time frame, the player jumps back in time to retrace the hero’s path toward  the ﬁ nal battle. The game occasionally features the narrating voice of the hero  that delivers a kind of inner monologue, and the disillusioned perspective of  Max Payne adds a distinct noir style to the game. This “telling” voice is so  strong that on one occasion, Max can reﬂ ect upon a nightmarish vision of him  being part of a video game controlled by somebody else. The narrator displays   Chapter 9  146   awareness of his own role in the textual process, addressing the player directly  through the reference. He directly addresses the differences between the rule- based and the ﬁ ctional plane via the mediated plane. In that way he reinforces  connections between them and toward the player.  At the same time, the dominating camera is a mixture of following camera  and  over-the-shoulder  shot—an  external  focalizer.  The  camera  consciously  plays with tropes from Hong Kong ﬁ lm genres in features such as the bullet  time or bullet ride. Players receive mixed signals. They control the character  of Max Payne and hear his internal monologue but at the same time they look  at him from the outside. This might be a standard technique, for example, in  ﬁ lm, but what is new here is that players control both layers. They direct the  hero  through  his  adventures  as  well  as  adjust  the  eye  of  the  camera.  Both  actions are interconnected but separate. This gap between focalizer and object  of interest allows for complex presentation. Max Payne’s most versatile exam- ples of focalization feature in the dream drug sequences.  In  these  scenes  I  control  Max  as  he  revisits  a  spatially  distorted  vision  of  his  own  former  apartment.  I  recognize  the  location  because  it  cites  the  memorable  ﬁ rst  level  of  the  game  again.  This  level  remained  important  because  it  introduced  me  to  the  hero’s  main  motivation,  the  source  of  his  internal  wound.  While  I  explored  the  apartment  in  the  game’s  opening,  a  group of drugged thugs killed Max’s family in the other rooms. No matter  how fast I tried to catch up with them, I couldn’t prevent this slaughter and  I can’t help but feel partially guilty. Did I do something wrong? Was there  any way this disaster could have been avoided? The sequence offers a strong  incentive to emotionally connect to the main character through the shock of  the crime. It remains a central location for the virtual hero’s personal story.  When Max and I revisit this location as a distorted surreal copy in the dream  drug sequences, the context, shape, and relevance of the location clearly grow  from  the  character,  his  past,  his  attitude,  and  his  voice.  The  location  also  points back to my own relationship to Max and the game world. Technically,  the visualization stays external in the form of an interactive following camera.  At the same time, the focalizing camera tries to present Max’s internal percep- tion of the surrounding game world, distorted as if seen while on drugs. It  includes color ﬁ lters, paths of blood, distorted architecture, and foggy abysses  that  have  no  counterpart  in  the  realistic  style  of  the  rest  of  the  game.  The  camera still looks at the hero but the images are seemingly ﬁ ltered through his  eyes. Notably, this form of presentation was continued and elaborated on in  the sequel Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne    Järvilehto 2003 , in which  dream sequences are repeatedly used, for example to introduce new chapters  in the game.  Effects of Narrative Filters  147   The same effect is applied and enhanced in American McGee’s Alice  McGee  2000 , where the whole game is set inside the heroine’s mind. Like Payne,  Alice had a traumatic experience that changed her life and shaped the state  of the game world. In the opening cutscene Alice fails to alert her family that  their house is on ﬁ re and her parents die in the ﬂ ames. The event implants a  guilt  complex  into  Alice,  which  ultimately  extends  into  the  whole  game  world. Mirroring Lewis Carroll’s creation of an imaginary Wonderland within  Alice’s creative mind, McGee throws the player into a horror version of such  a world distorted by guilt.  The ﬁ nal battle in Alice has to be read as one against her own guilt and  evolves over multiple stages. First, it is a battle against the Queen of Hearts,  the monster staged as the ruler of the game universe who seemingly perverted  Alice’s once-peaceful Wonderland. But her role changes as Alice destroys dif- ferent versions of the shape-shifting enemy, only to discover and ultimately  defeat “herself” at the heart of the ﬁ nal version. After the destruction of herself,  Alice’s internal fantasy world—the virtual game universe—disintegrates and  a ring of stones ﬂ oating in empty space is all that is left of Alice’s “decon- structed self” and her internal world. This is the arena for the ﬁ nal ﬁ ght, set  in a dark world without end in sight. Here, Alice battles an almost shapeless  monster: a manifestation of her guilt complex as it rises in the center of the   Figure  9.1 American McGee’s Alice:  Alice  ﬁ nds  herself  at  the  heart  of  evil;  the  caption  reads: “If you destroy me, you destroy yourself!”  Chapter 9  148   stone ring. Finally, at the end of her adventures, Alice faces her true problem.  The game literally forces her to “face” her destructive feeling of guilt, as the  player can only ﬁ ght the ﬁ nal monster by looking at it, constantly maneuver- ing on the last pieces of the navigable world that was Alice’s Wonderland.  Technically, American  McGee’s  Alice  uses  the  Quake  engine  and  much  of  its  gameplay  resembles  the  fast-paced  action  of  this  seminal  ﬁ rst-person  shooter   American  McGee  was  a  renowned  level  designer  on  DOOM  2, Quake, and Quake II . Interestingly enough, McGee chose to replace Quake’s ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view  with  an  external  following  camera  throughout,  with occasional cutscenes and a ﬁ rst-person point of view that allows for ori- entation but excludes further interaction. The camera is looking at Alice, but  the  game  setting  pulls  the  player  inside  the  main  character’s  mind.  Tim  Schafer’s Psychonauts  Schafer 2005  also implements this concept of the hero  entering  an  internal  psychic  world,  yet  in  Psychonauts  the  player  controls  a  character  distinct  from  the  worlds  he  enters:  an  explorer  of  others’  psychic  worlds  that  can,  at  times,  distort  the  perception  of  the  hero  to  emphasize  this perspective.  Like Max Payne, God of War  Jaffe 2005  situates its game setting in the  ﬂ ashback of the main hero. In the opening cutscene the hero starts at the “end  of the line,” which happens to be at the edge of an enormous rise. In God of  War  this  end  of  the  line  is  located  at  the  cliffs  of  Mount  Olympus,  in  the  contemporary Max Payne it is atop the skyscraper of the main enemy corpora- tion—in both cases the only option left is to step forward into the abyss. The  difference  is  that  in  God  of  War,  Kratos,  a  ﬁ erce  warrior,  actually  seems  to  commit suicide by jumping off that cliff. The moment the hero seems to hit  the ground, the game transports the player back three weeks in the ﬁ ctional  game time. The player controls Kratos’s actions toward that end, which turns  out to be just one more twist in the storyline. Like a lifetime of memories  ﬂ ashing by in the last moments before death, the biggest part of the game  unfolds in this gameplay, which includes various perspective changes as well  as internal ﬂ ashbacks inside these memories. It also includes the hero’s family  tragedy that shapes his motivation. In God of War, Kratos himself kills his  wife and daughter, blames the gods somehow for this disaster, and rushes to  revenge  this  injustice.  Unlike  Max  Payne, God  of  War  reveals  this  initial  motivation  to  the  player  only  bit  by  bit,  in  prerendered  cutscenes  that  are  unlocked at speciﬁ c moments and commented on by an external narrator— clearly not in Kratos’s voice but that of a woman. Even more so than in Prince of  Persia:  Sands  of  Time,  the  camera  is  an  external  focalizer.  Viewpoints  are  deﬁ ned in space and react to the player’s movement through the levels, but  the interactor has no access to the camera controls whatsoever. Players look   Effects of Narrative Filters  149   at Kratos but never through his eyes, and never gain camera control except  when sharpshooting.  The hero initially remains more detached. While the immediate shock of  Max Payne’s or Alice’s opening sequence draws the player into the hero’s world,  character revelations in God of War are fragmented. In God of War the player  controls the main character but almost follows him through the linear game  space. Over time one can build up a relation to this character, and although  the initial killing of the family is not interactive the game features a scene  comparable to the beginning of Max Payne later on in the quest. In one of the  later levels, the player seems to get the opportunity to save his virtual family  from copies of himself. But there is no chance to change the past; the family  will die, as was the case in Max Payne. Again, this ﬁ nal ﬁ ght is staged in the  setting of the initial slaughter, a temple-like structure. While the ﬁ ght con- tinues, the original structure disintegrates and breaks into pieces until only  small  rocks  remain,  ﬂ oating  in  some  heavenly  space.  Like  American  McGee’s  Alice the core of the character is reduced to rubble, to a ruin that lacks any  “way out.” The player clearly plays the hero’s “inner space” and ﬁ nally reaches  a close connection to him as the ﬁ ctional plane literally copies Kratos’s main  dilemma.  Ultimately, God  of  War  keeps  the  player  at  a  certain  distance  from  the  character through the continuous external focalization. Unlike in Max Payne or American  McGee’s  Alice,  the  hero  cannot  reﬂ ect  upon  his  state  as  a  game  character. He remains a pawn and lacks the necessary independence to realize  such a state. It is telling that at the very end the initial suicide is prevented  and  Kratos  instead  is  elevated  to  Olympus  to  become  a  new  god—beyond  such mortal problems such as guilt.  Distinguishing between focalization and narrating voice in open structures,  such as simulation or strategy games, can be more difﬁ cult as their “voices”  are  often  less  present  or  articulate.  But  a  weakened  voice narrator  does  not  necessarily  imply  a  weaker  focalizer.  Because  the  camera  has  been  detached  from the in-game event, it can remain a strong narrating ﬁ lter to the action  depicted  even  if  the  events  seem  chaotic  and  overwhelming.  In  fact,  many  open-structure games offer strong and directed visual focalization.  Age of Mythology  Fischer 2002  loosely connects its battles along a storyline.  One part of these campaigns includes battles fought in a dream world of the  general-hero. In addition, there are interconnecting cutscenes to contextualize  the  next  ﬁ ght  but  no  distinct  narrative  voice  “tells”  or  comments  on  the  battles. The freedom of the player to command the troops on the virtual bat- tleﬁ eld  is  key  to  the  battle  simulation  elements  of  the  game.  At  the  same  time, the player controls the camera that presents the game space exclusively   Chapter 9  150   from an external view. A crucial feature of the game is the instant reposition- ing  of  this  camera.  Players  can  teleport  the  camera  to  look  at  any  location  of  the  virtual  playground,  meaning  they  can  focus  in  an  instant  on  a  new  battle  or  check  their  bases.  The  feature  is  essential,  because  access  and  fast  response  to  events  spread  throughout  the  game  world  is  crucial.  It  is  also  a  good  example  for  detached  camera  and  variable  focalization  based  on  interaction. To win a complex battle in Age of Mythology, I have to constantly  shift  focus  from  one  location  to  another.  Focalization  is  driven  by  me,  the  player, and is vital for the “open” gameplay, while the narrative voice can be  watered down.  9.2  Control and Guidance  Focalization  in  video  games  cannot  simply  copy  cinematic  traditions.  If  it  does, the result is a return to a linear format—the cutscene. In contrast, an  interactive detached camera like Lakitu in Super Mario 64 or the variable god  perspective of Age of Mythology empowers the player to direct the view at any  detail—signiﬁ cant  or  not.  How  can  this  freedom  still  maintain  a  focus  on  selected objects within the game world, as demanded by Bal?  Video  games  occasionally  operate  against  the  freedom  offered  by  their  interactive cameras to “structure” the view. For example Prince of Persia: The  Sands  of  Time  can  automatically  enforce  certain  camera  positions  when  the  system considers such adjustments necessary; God of War adjusts the camera  only to the position of the avatar and even excludes any player inﬂ uence except  for sharpshooting segments. Such camera behavior is a clear example of focal- ization that offers powerful guidance via the visualization, but has to face some  criticism. The limitations of the camera in God of War turn its virtual space  into  a  ﬁ lm  set  with  a  clearly  deﬁ ned  fourth  wall.  Levels  do  not  have  to  be  complete any more as players concentrate on the section that is visible in the  camera.  Because  players  cannot  control  the  view  and  cannot  turn  around  the viewpoint, no geometry will be found beyond the framing of the picture.  The camera simply refuses to show this section. Players can ﬁ nd themselves  running against the fourth wall of the camera lens that deﬁ nes one borderline  of the existing world. While this might enhance the cinematic control of the  designer, it limits the player’s visual access to the game world. The focalizing  forces can become quite literally an obstacle.  A less rigid direction of view tries to encourage instead of enforce the focus  on points of signiﬁ cance. Drawing from Gibson’s “affordances”  1986 , Fencott  outlined  the  concept  of  “perceptual  opportunities”   1999 ,  which  aim  to  structure the player’s perception of a virtual space via stimulating rather then   Effects of Narrative Filters  151   enforcing through the use of “attractors.” “Attractors are POs [= Perceptual  Opportunities] that seek to draw the attention of a user directly to areas of  interest or to situations that require action”  Isdale et al. 2002, 11–12 .  These attractors can either repel  as “objects of fear”  or attract  as “objects  of desire” . The overall model is an ambitious combination of presentational  features  and  events,  which  complicates  a  proper  validation.  However,  the  notion of attractors supports the claim for evocative narrative elements and  points toward an extension of these elements onto cameras and the design of  the game world. In the case of presentation, affordances are a powerful tool  to guide the player. The view might be interactive, but the game can call for  certain perspectives through the situation of the gameplay. It can shape the  mise-en-scène  through  its  control  over  the  space  and  the  necessary  action  within it. This happens all the time in games, but rarely is acknowledged as  meaningful focalization.  As  mentioned  for  American  McGee’s  Alice,  the  ﬁ nal  ﬁ ght  exempliﬁ es  this  focalization. In order to destroy the ﬁ nal monster, Alice has to look at it. Alice  has to face and overcome her guilt. The player has to align the view axis via  Alice onto the monster. When God of War’s Kratos defends his family he has  to  “hug”  his  wife  to  increase  her  “life”  variable.  This  is  accompanied  by  a  closing-in camera, which moves back once the ﬁ ghting starts again. Kratos  has to visually reunite with his wife and daughter and the camera work takes  the player with him. Max Payne has to look at the bloody path in order to  follow it through the dream levels. The hero has to deal with his past and the  player  shares  the  situation,  immersed  in  the  same  distorted  “inner”  game  world. The impact of this guidance of the view is so strong that Davis has  even  argued  that  Max  Payne  uses  noir  style  in  its  camera  work  although  it  remains interactive throughout  2002 .  Focalization in all three examples is also achieved via directed spatial design  that concentrates on the bare necessities of the visual cue: the ﬁ nal stage in  American McGee’s Alice is a ring of rubble; the stage of Kratos’s family-saving  attempt in God of War is a hall gradually breaking into pieces and turning  into an island ﬂ oating in space; the apartment of Max Payne is reduced to a  ghostly nightmare version of the original.  The effect of visual attractors, thus, is often accompanied by a reduction  of  the  architectural  space.  DOOM  3  can  serve  as  one  example  that  applies  comparable concepts without any limitation of the camera control. DOOM 3’s camera  during  interactive  gameplay  employs  strictly  a  ﬁ rst-person  point  of  view. Through the eyes of the main protagonist the player encounters a world  that is dark and gloomy. The game’s 3D engine was hailed as another evolu-  Chapter 9  152   tionary development to attain higher levels of realism and dynamic lighting,  but instead of presenting as many objects as possible all the time and showing  off the new polygon masses, DOOM 3 leaves much of its world in darkness.  Only fragments of the game space are illuminated, but enemies can lurk liter- ally behind every object. The game space overwhelms the player with ever- changing, highly detailed objects to focus on. Danger is omnipresent but the  available visual pointers are fragmenting. Enemies can attack from anywhere  at anytime, much like in a survival horror game. Finding the right visual and  audio prompt is essential.  Playing DOOM  3,  I  ﬁ nd  my  health  at  a  dangerously  low  level,  and  I’m  running  out  of  ammunition  as  I  steer  my  space  marine  into  a  twisted  corridor  with  hidden  corners,  where  ﬂ ickering  lights  cast  dancing  shadows  on strange machines and sparks cut through volumetric fog that fades into  the darkness of other sections. I know only too well that some monster is out  there  somewhere,  but  the  mix  of  darkness  and  dynamic  lighting  makes  it  difﬁ cult to focus on any one object. My attention is drawn toward multiple  points  at  the  same  time.  The  sudden  appearance  of  the  monster—and  if  there is one imperative in games such as DOOM 3, then it is the continuous  promise  to  deliver  that  next  monster—demands  complete  attention.  In  a  shock moment I have to bundle all my scattered attention and deal with the  approaching enemy. Focus shifts from all other objects to concentrate on the  attacking beast.  Film audiences might miss the introduction of the monster  or close their  eyes  in  fear   but  still  enjoy  the  rest  of  the  show  without  any  disruption.  Missing  the  arrival  of  an  enemy  in  DOOM  3  usually  leads  to  an  untimely  death, signiﬁ es failure, and brings with it the punishment of having to reload  and play the sequence again. To “survive” in the world of DOOM 3, a player  has to remain glued to the game world, constantly ﬁ lling in the blanks left  by the pieces of visual cues, expecting the worst. You cannot look away when  the monster ﬁ nally attacks but have to focus as fast as possible on the new  challenge. DOOM 3 illustrates that in video games focalization is not only a  “pushing” technique as it is in ﬁ lm, but also a “pulling” one. It can pull pre- cisely because the camera is interactive and players can search the game space  for more information. Because the camera is interactive it can support dynamic  focalization. The object to focus on becomes a directing force, and the relation- ship  between  focalizer  and  focused  object  is  strengthened,  not  weakened,  because it is dynamic and interactive.  Focalization  uses  the  operation  of  the  presentation  elements  as  narrative  ﬁ lters that provide a form of perspective toward the events as they unfold on   Effects of Narrative Filters  153   the virtual stage. The focalizer can serve both masters: the directing designer  and the interacting player. It operates as a narrative guide through the game  universe, an application of the narrative ﬁ ltering identiﬁ ed in the preceding  chapter. It has the power to increase a game’s drama without forcing it into  a linear cage. Genette’s initial distinction of “who tells” and “who sees” grew  out of a literary tradition in which the “telling” was a given. Bal untied them  further with respect to visual media. Video games rip this distinction further  apart through the element of interaction. Yet, while the interaction is sup- ported, the focalizing power of the presentation remains at work and can even  grow in importance.  Focalization as developed in the context of interactive camera work helps  players  to  comprehend  any  given  game  situation,  contextualize  the  event,  create  strategies  to  address  it,  and  ultimately  interact  with  it.  In  that  way,  the  process  of  comprehension,  planning,  and  action  positions  the  narrative  moment of focalization right at the heart of the game, as a powerful way to  engage with the game space. It stretches between all the analytical planes and  draws them closer as it becomes an effective and active part of the encounter  of the game space.  Presentation  is  a  condition  for  the  creation  of  video  game  spaces.  These  spaces combine elements from architecture and ﬁ lm and depend on the medi- ated  plane  to  become  accessible  for  the  player.  Presentation  is  therefore  a  precondition for meaningful interaction with them. Games might remediate  cinematic techniques and their spaces might apply ﬁ lmic forms of visualiza- tion, but they do so in order to implement and support the interactive access  available within this space. Often both are intertwined, as seen in the camera  control and editing examples. That is why we cannot discuss presentation of  game spaces from a cinematic perspective only. Like movies, games are part  of the moving-image tradition in their visualization, but they have their own  clearly established traditions that are closely tied to interaction. This develop- ment is ongoing and the examples presented are only a select few from the  immensely rich ﬁ eld. They nevertheless highlight the importance of taking  presentation in video game seriously, base it in the game space and its condi- tions, and connect it to a game’s functionality.  These  forms  of  presentation  are  not  neutral,  and  the  way  we  encounter  game spaces is not neutral. Whether it is the camera work, the editing, or the  sound, each adds a form of narrative ﬁ lter to the game environment. Because  presentation is dynamic and often interactive, this ﬁ lter is neither simple nor  static. Furthermore, it is constantly at work, adjusting and guiding the player  without directly blocking interactive access. In that way, it provides a form  of structure. Focalization is one form of this guidance.  Chapter 9  154   If one is pressed, then the question of whether presentation is as valuable  as functionality is a chicken-and-egg dilemma. One cannot interact with the  game without the necessary layer of presentation, and without the interaction  the  presentation  might  as  well  be  that  of  an  established  media  format.  But when both presentation and functionality are interconnected, the results  are  very  effective  game  worlds  where  the  textual  process  is  supported  in  ingenious ways.  Effects of Narrative Filters  155    III  Functionality  The functionality of video games describes what a player can do in a game and  how. It is a product of the rule-based procedurality of digital media, which  allows for the dynamic use and change of game data. A lot of systems apply  procedural  techniques,  including  artiﬁ cial  intelligence,  interactive  ﬁ ction  systems, and simulations. Here, the focus will remain on space; thus a game  world is approached as a spatially deﬁ ned condition for interaction.    10  Architectural Approaches  This  chapter  builds  the  bridge  from  polygon  game  worlds  to  architectural  theory. It combines architectural concepts in a basic framework, which is then  used  to  look  at  a  number  of  sample  structures.  Architecture  helps  describe  how a game world can gain signiﬁ cance and a quality or “place,” which is at  the  core  of  the  last  chapters  of  this  book.  Depending  on  their  interaction  with the world, players change their positioning toward these environments  and take on a role. This role, its limitations, and its possibilities are discussed  before  part  III  introduces  story  maps.  Story  maps  offer  a  model  to  understand  the  player’s  overall  comprehension  of  the  engagement  with  the  game world.  A  designer  of  3D  video  games  uses  evocative  narrative  elements  in  the  virtual space and the interactive access to stimulate the player’s participation  and comprehension of the game world. One way to arrange this stimulation  is the structure of the navigable virtual space. How then does space connect  to the work of evocative elements? What processes can be shaped by a spatial  design  and  how  might  they  inﬂ uence  a  player’s  comprehension  of  game  events? What is the functionality of rule-driven, architectural game spaces?  It is the use of and interaction with the game world, or any other space,  from which the character of the space can evolve. As Alexander recognizes:  “A building or a town is given its character, essentially, by those events which keep on  happening  there  most  often”   1979,  66;  italics  in  original .  Like  digital  game  worlds, architectural space comes to life through the way it is used, and spe- ciﬁ c structures can help particular patterns evolve. But this is not a one-way  connection. At the same time, patterns of use reﬂ ect on architectural arrange- ments.  Learning  from  architecture,  3D  games  can  assist  concentration  on    certain patterns of events and make others less likely to occur. They can also  realize  that  the  ultimate  target  has  to  be  meaningful  usage  of  these  space,  which means that they might be literally taken over by players and remodeled  by their activity. How can architectural theory be applied to video games and  help to identify and enhance the properties of video game spaces?  Numerous analyses of architectural structures deﬁ ne elements or patterns  connected  to  particular  qualities  that  affect  the  inhabitants.  Elements  have  been deﬁ ned ranging from basic geometric shapes  e.g., Ching 1979  through  interconnected patterns of use  Alexander 1964, 1979; Alexander, Ishikawa,  and Silverstein 1977  to cognitive structures  K. Lynch 1960  and social spaces   Hillier and Hanson 1984 . Unifying these categories is beyond the scope of  this  and probably any  book. The patterns and elements do not assemble into  one  singular  structure  and  cannot  be  forced  into  a  ﬁ xed  “meaning.”  Ching  explicitly excludes such an attempt  1979, 386 , as do Lynch  1960, 9  and  Mitchell   1990,  204 .  Alexander,  however,  addresses  the  task  of  matching  meaning, structure, and use when he proclaims: “There is one timeless way  of  building”   1979,  7   that  encapsulates  all  fundamentally  active  patterns.  “The quality without a name in us, our liveliness, our thirst for life, depends  directly  on  the  patterns  in  the  world,  and  the  extent  to  which  they  have  this quality themselves. Patterns, which live, release this quality in us. But  they release this quality in us, essentially because they have it in themselves”   ibid., 122 .  Alexander’s universal combination of meaning and structure focuses archi- tectural complexity in one holistic concept. The all-embracing presence of this  “quality without a name” renders it problematic but nonetheless inspirational.  Alexander makes this theory more concrete in a collection of spatial patterns   Alexander,  Ishikawa,  and  Silverstein  1977 .  Chapter  10  does  not  seek  to  deﬁ ne a single “language of architecture” but to identify a framework of spatial  understanding on different levels, which can be applied to game spaces.  First, it will develop its model from an assembly of various architectural  theories and try to interconnect their key features in an admittedly simpliﬁ ed  model. Then, it covers some speciﬁ cs that are outside the scope of traditional  architecture but integral to the nature of virtual space. Chapter 11 will apply  these theoretical references to some examples drawn from typical game-like  spatial structures.  10.1  Preparing the Model  Inﬂ uenced  by  Heidegger,  architectural  theorist  Norberg-Schulz   1980,  10   starts  his  analysis  of  space  by  dividing  architectural  space  into  two  classes:   Chapter 10  160   human-made  space   settlements   and  natural  space   landscapes .  Natural  places  are  identiﬁ ed  as  landscapes  with  extension  and  surface  relief,  whose  characters are deﬁ ned through texture, color, and vegetation. Human-made  spaces show human beings’ understanding and shaping of the natural space  that they build in. “The existential purpose of building  architecture  is there- fore to make a site become a place, that is, to uncover the meanings potentially  present in the given environment”  ibid., 18 . These human-made places relate  to natural spaces in three different ways:   cid:2   They  make  the  natural  space  more  precise—including  the  visualization  of the natural space, the understanding of it, and the resulting building in  it;  for  example,  where  the  natural  space  indicates  a  direction,  a  path  can  be created.  cid:2   They complement the natural space—adding what seems to be lacking in the  natural  space;  for  example,  a  canyon  might  be  crossed  by  a  bridge  built  to  allow further access.  cid:2   They symbolize the human understanding of nature—including the transla- tion of acquired meaning of a space into another medium: “The purpose of  symbolization is to free the meaning from the immediate situation, whereby  it becomes a ‘cultural object’, which may form part of a more complex situa- tion, or be moved to another place”  Norberg-Schulz 1980, 17, still based on  Heidegger . For example: the Golden Gate Bridge has become a cultural icon  beyond its functionality as a connecting bridge reproduced in various forms  and media.  All three effects are interconnected in the process of creating a place. Before  one can build a bridge or any other structure that uncovers the qualities of  the given space, one has to understand that a certain spot is a good place for  such a structure. Such an understanding depends on a “reading” of space, a  concept  that  leads  into  the  realms  of  spatial  recognition  and  cognitive  mapping.  Cognitive  maps  are  complex  mental  interpretations  of  a  real  or  ﬁ ctional  environment, and its components that live in the ﬁ ctional plane. Roger M.  Downs and David Stea argue that “cognitive mapping is a process composed  of a series of psychological transformations by which an individual acquires,  stores, recalls, and decodes information about the relative locations and attri- butes of the phenomena in his everyday spatial environment”  qtd. in Kitchin  and Freundschuh 2000, 1 . The process for generating such a map differs from  observer to observer. Kevin Lynch refers to the “light of his [= the observer’s]  own purposes” that is responsible for the generation of differing maps from   Architectural Approaches  161   the  same  environment   1960,  6 .  We  can  already  add  that  for  video  game  spaces the presentation is an essential part in this “light.”  Each observer’s cognitive map is unique. A tourist and a local police ofﬁ cer  might read the same city structures—for example, the Golden Gate Park— but their cognitive maps differ completely, reﬂ ecting their subjective perspec- tives,  individual  experiences  within  the  city,  and  the  conditions  of  those  experiences.  However,  Lynch  analyzes  the  way  observers  create  such  a  cognitive map of a city and extracts ﬁ ve shared elements that deﬁ ne evolving  cognitive maps for different individuals:  landmark—evoked, for example, by monuments or historic sites;   cid:2   path—evoked, for example, by images of streets or rail tracks;  cid:2    cid:2   edge—evoked, for example, by rivers or seashores;  cid:2   node—evoked, for example, by crossings; and  cid:2   district—evoked, for example, by suburbs  K. Lynch 1960, 49–83 .  These  ﬁ ve  elements  are  distinct  parts  of  the  mental  image  of  a  spatial  structure that help observers to generate a cognitive map of the environment.  Depending on the observer’s position, a single spatial structure can have dif- ferent connotative elements attached—for example, a bridge might be a path  to use for someone standing on it, a landmark for orientation for someone far  from it, or—if too low—an edge for a ship trying to pass under it. Perspec- tive, positioning, and the “light of the purpose” profoundly inﬂ uence these  assignments and the generation of the cognitive map. As these factors change,  cognitive maps are constantly updated and rearranged. During the exploration  of a physical space “nothing is experienced by itself, but always in relation to  its surroundings, the sequences of events leading up to it, the memory of past  experiences”  ibid., 1 . The resulting cognitive map ties spaces together in a  meaningful way, assembles events in a spatial order, and positions the human  in relationship to them.  Here, Alexander’s “pattern language” is a good reference point. As unifying  as  the  “quality  without  a  name”  might  be,  Alexander  also  recognizes  that  every  culture,  every  subculture,  and  in  fact  every  member  of  a  culture,  can  and should have its own collection of “patterns.” But he also argues that shared  pattern systems can be identiﬁ ed. His collection of 253 patterns is one of these  pattern systems. It consists of spatial hypotheses of which some, he claims,  have qualities of archetypes. “In this sense, at least a part of the language we  have presented here, is the archetypical core of all possible pattern languages,  which  can  make  people  feel  alive  and  human”   Alexander,  Ishikawa,  and  Silverstein 1977, xvii . The patterns differ widely in size, from large regions   Chapter 10  162   inhabited by two to ten million people  pattern 1: Independent Regions  to  “what kinds of things to pin up on the walls”  pattern 253: Things from Your  Life   ibid., 1165 . One of the more archetypical patterns is that of arcades  described as ambiguous spaces between the inside and the outside of a build- ing  that—through  their  ambiguity—make  the  building  more  “friendly”   ibid., 581 . Arcades are described with a perspective to how a visitor might  encounter them and in terms of “paths,” “places,” and “edges.” For example,  Alexander, Ishikawa, and Silverstein argue that “to establish this place as a  territory which is also apart from the public world, it must be felt as an exten- sion of the building interior and therefore covered”  ibid., 582 . Kevin Lynch’s  principles  reappear  in  the  details  of  such  a  pattern.  They  materialize  in  detailed spatial observations.  Ching concentrates on visible architecture and provides detailed deﬁ nitions  of those visual properties at work in architecture that can be applied to evoke  the  images  leading  to  more  complex  forms  such  as  Alexander’s  patterns  or  Lynch’s key elements. He deﬁ nes “visual properties” as consisting of “shape  size color texture position orientation visual  inertia”   Ching  1979,  51 .  The  resulting  combinations  of  properties  are  manifold,  but  Ching  establishes  limited ordering principles, among them:   cid:2   Axis—A line established by two points in space and about which forms  and spaces can be arranged.  cid:2   Symmetry—The  balanced  distribution  of  equivalent  forms  and  spaces  about a common line  axis  or point  center .  cid:2   Hierarchy—The articulation of the importance or signiﬁ cance of a form or  space by its size, shape, or placement, relative to the other forms and spaces  of the organization.  cid:2   Rhythm Repetition—The  use  of  recurring  patterns,  and  their  resultant  rhythms, to organize a series of like forms or spaces.  cid:2   Datum—A line, plane, or volume that, by its continuity and regularity,  serves to collect, gather, and organize a pattern of forms and spaces.  cid:2   Transformation—The principle that an architectural concept of organiza- tion can be retained, strengthened, and built upon through a series of discrete  manipulations and transformations  ibid., 333 .  These ordering principles determine the visual properties, which then can  evoke  Kevin  Lynch’s  “mental  images.”  In  terms  of  design,  a  bridge,  for  example, consists of various visual properties arranged in a special way: arcs,  beams, surfaces as shapes, pillars of a certain size arranged in a certain repeti- tive  pattern,  concrete  or  metal  as  colored  textures,  all  occupying  a  given   Architectural Approaches  163   position and orientation within the surroundings. These ceilings, pillars, and  pathways can add up to make an arcade “friendly.”  Various examples have demonstrated that virtual space is ﬁ lled with evoca- tive narrative elements that help to transform its arbitrary origins into mean- ingful worlds. In the design of these game worlds, combining Ching’s theories  with  those  of  Lynch  and  Norberg-Schulz  is  strikingly  helpful.  The  visual  properties  of  a  video  game  space  correspond  with  the  immediately  visible  geometrical information in a game world and can be analyzed and designed  in accordance to Ching’s principles. Indeed, the modeling functions of a 3D  creation program like Maya copy Ching’s “visual properties.” They can also  be encountered in structures that might follow Alexander’s pattern. In com- bination with interactive events and explorations, these structures can evoke  certain readings of a space. These readings use Lynch’s deﬁ nition of the main  structural elements and lead to a mental image of the space for the visitor—a  cognitive map. Based on such an understanding of the space, the player forms  a new interpretation of the virtual world. Here, Norberg-Schulz’s outline can  describe the possible nature of this evolving relationship to virtual space. The  combined  model  presents  a  connection  from  the  single  evocative  spatial  element and its visual appearance to the overall context that is projected into  a space.  Although this brief overview of architectural theories cannot hope to offer  an  in-depth  evaluation  of  their  claims,  in  summary,  it  provides  a  way  to  describe  how  evocative  spatial  features  can  affect  a  player’s  perception  and  interaction. But having prepared the architectural vocabulary for game spaces,  one immediately faces another challenge: virtual space is not restricted by the  same limitations as the physical space on which these architectural theories  are based.  10.2  Expanding the Space  Due to their mathematical nature, game spaces can be encountered in ways  that Norberg-Schulz did not foresee for physical spaces. Two new features are  the destruction and construction of space, which offer an addition to Norberg- Schulz’s three main activities in relation to space. The notion of destruction  has a different meaning in an experiential game world due to the mathemati- cal—instead  of  natural physical—foundations  of  virtual  worlds.  Digitally  created space can be “destroyed” and blown into oblivion without any signiﬁ - cant  consequences  for  the  physical  world.  But  unlike  any  other  mediated  space, only the interactive environments can make this destruction experien- tial  to  the  player.  One  example  points  back  to  the  bridge  metaphor:  the   Chapter 10  164   ﬁ rst-person shooting game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault  Giolito 2002  posi- tions the player in the role of a U.S. soldier in World War II and incorporates  references to historical battle sites.  Once more I pick up the controller to win a war seemingly single-handed.  The ﬁ rst-person point of view takes me back to selected battleﬁ elds. At one  point in the game I receive the mission to guard a virtual bridge and prevent  enemy  access.  If  I  fail  to  stop  the  enemy  characters,  they  will  destroy  the  virtual bridge and my mission is a failure. Historically, the setup quotes an  important tactical moment of the World War II campaign “Operation Market  Garden.” It shaped the progress of the Allies into Germany in the summer of  1944, when they had to cross the rivers between the Netherlands and Germany  and needed connecting bridges. The battles ensuing have been the topic of  ﬁ lms  such  as  A  Bridge  Too  Far   Attenborough  1977 .  The  same  theme  of  guarding  a  bridge  also  turned  into  a  powerful  metaphor  for  the  German  antiwar ﬁ lm Die Brücke  Wicki 1959 . A number of visual cues and a wide  range of thematic references remain in Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. In fact,  the game’s origin itself points back to Hollywood and Steven Spielberg, who  is still credited as creator of the series. The Medal of Honor series clearly aims  at  a  dramatic  depiction  of  World  War  II  with  a  focus  on  atmosphere  and  action.  Still,  few  of  the  critical  notes  that  deﬁ ned  similarly  themed  movies  remain  in  the  game,  which  concentrates  more  on  heroism  and  pure  action.  My virtual killings of enemy soldiers to save that bridge are never questioned  in the same way that similar actions are, for example, in Die Brücke. Die Brücke tells  the  story  of  some  students,  who  are  positioned  as  the  last  line  of  a  senseless  defense  against  the  approaching  superior  Allied  forces.  It  concen- trates entirely on the stories of those German troops that remain faceless and  nameless opponents in Medal of Honor.  The difference in relevance is also apparent in the use of space in the game.  Unlike  any  physical  demolition,  the  destruction  of  the  game  bridge  is  an  interchangeable game state. If I fail in my guarding mission, the same scene  restarts  and  the  bridge  is  intact  once  more.  The  restart  not  only  resets  the  event time of the game world but also the spatial setting, the event space. In  a world where spatiotemporal settings are game states and basic variables of  a rule-based system, the buildings fade to mere possibilities. This applies to  in-game  architecture  as  well  as  any  other  “body”  that  inhabits  the  virtual  stage—including the player’s character. In Medal of Honor, as well as in most  other  ﬁ rst-person  shooter  games,  the  player-character  can  be  healed— reconstructed—almost at will. That certainly changes but does not necessarily  erase the signiﬁ cance of a virtual death. One earlier mission of Medal of Honor is another reenactment of the D-Day landing at Omaha beach.  Architectural Approaches  165   As character Mike Powell, I ﬁ nd myself on a landing boat approaching the  beach with no means to escape the counterattack. It is a claustrophobic and  scary situation that—like the entire sequence—borrows moments from Spiel- berg’s  own  version  of  the  D-Day  attack  in  Saving  Private  Ryan.  I  reach  the  beach and try to use any cover I can ﬁ nd on my way to the cliffs, but I keep  failing. Mike Powell dies again and again. Thanks to the reload function the  virtual  death  can  easily  be  dealt  with  and  the  game  resets  to  the  last  save  point. This surely is no realistic simulation as I cheat death constantly. But  even with that cheat the experience of virtual deaths is overwhelming to the  level of frustration. After Mike Powell has been shot by virtual snipers, killed  by  virtual  machine  guns,  blown  up  by  virtual  mortars,  and  annihilated  by  virtual mines, I start to reﬂ ect upon the situation. The overall game might  remain a kind of World War II theme park ride, but at that moment I get a  glimpse of an antiwar message because body and space are interactive game  states that I can play with. The shocking deaths of the historic attack cannot  be recreated by either ﬁ lm or game but reinterpreted by both media to evoke  some  new  understanding  in  their  audiences—I  ﬁ nd  myself  experiencing  exactly this effect.  Computer values that give birth to the navigable space can be set to naught  and  the  world  might  simply  disappear,  but  the  effect  of  that  reset  can  be  expressive and signiﬁ cant for me as the player. Through active participation  in this world, the player can add to it and become a part of it—own it—even  though it might all just disappear in the next minute. At times, players can  revolt against such a data disappearance.  The  player  community  of  the  beta-test  for  the  online  world  Uru   Miller  2003  was told that the game would not launch into the commercial stage.  But during the test, the online world had become the home for a great many  social  interactions  and  had  turned  into  an  important  place  for  the  players.  Their virtual “home” was on the edge of oblivion. Players met and debated  possible steps and literally emigrated from the Uru world into other online  universes such as There  Harvey et al. 2003  or Second Life, where they recreated  the locations of their Uru “home world”  Pearce 2007 . This reaction points  to  another  option  in  video  game  spaces—the  creation  of  space.  Instead  of  changing an existing virtual environment, these virtual emigrants created new  spaces to inhabit based on the technologies provided by the system.  Digital  space  can  be  created  and  extended  whenever  desired  and  is  not  limited by any physical restrictions apart from the computer’s hardware and  software. Good examples of this are procedural game worlds that create game  spaces in real-time during gameplay. Procedural game spaces have been imple- mented in a small number of game titles, most notably in Rescue from Fractalus  Chapter 10  166    Fox  1986 ,  as  well  as  in  architectural  systems   e.g.,  Novak  1991,  1996b;  Parish and Mueller 2001; Wonka et al. 2003 , and art and research projects   e.g., Furmanski 2005 . Modern games often use  random  level generators as  space generators for new game levels, as implemented in the Age of Empires series and the Diablo series, but also in the classic predecessor for Diablo: Rogue  Toy,  Arnold,  and  Wichman  1980 .  Wichman   1997   wrote,  “Most  of  the  existing  adventure-type  games  had  ‘canned’  adventures—they  were  exactly  the same every time you played, and of course the programmers had to invent  all of the puzzles, and therefore would always know how to beat the game.  We decided that with Rogue, the program itself should ‘build the dungeon,’  giving you a new adventure every time you played, and making it possible  for even the creators to be surprised by the game”  ibid. .  Yet the generation of space and the interactive access of the player to this  world  remained  unconnected.  Instead,  level  generators  create  more  or  less  random game spaces.  The other extreme is world generation by players, as seen, for example, in  Second Life. Here, the game space expands with a growing user base and gets  more  detailed  the  more  this  user  base  adds  its  own  content  to  the  virtual  playground.  In  these  cases,  the  world  creation  happens  independently  from  the existing game universe, as seen in Second Life, or independently from the  player,  as  in  Rescue  from  Fractalus.  Game  space  and  agency  of  the  player  in  relation to its generation are not balanced.  To  change  this,  we  started  a  research  project,  called  Charbitat—Game Characters and Procedural Spaces, at Georgia Tech and incorporated this feature  in our basic design principle  e.g., Nitsche et al. 2006 . Unlike other games,  Charbitat generates game spaces based on the player’s attributes and actions  and not on predeﬁ ned or random data. In the single-player prototype of Char- bitat,  the  player  controls  a  little  girl  on  a  quest  through  a  vast—in  fact  endless—game world. As in other 3D adventure and exploration games, the  hero is attacked by enemies, has to master the environment, and ﬁ nd certain  key  elements  to  overcome  thresholds  and  to  proceed.  But  in  Charbitat,  the  way a player chooses to play  which enemies to kill, what path to chose  affects  the gradual generation of the underlying game world.  The world of Charbitat is split up into tiles—each one about ﬁ ve hundred  virtual meters across. Beyond the existing tiles is a sea of clouded emptiness.  Whenever the hero reaches the borderline into this void and steps forward, a  new tile is generated at that location. The player is creating the world as she  plays through it. The result is an ever-expanding game space. This world is  codeﬁ ned by the player’s behavior. Depending on the actions of the player,  certain values attached to the hero change, and these values are then mapped   Architectural Approaches  167   Figure 10.1 Charbitat: example of height-map generation and assembly into a tile-world in  the underlying Java code  left  and actual screenshot of the 3D world  right   onto the expanding game world. The in-game world is created for and in ref- erence to the player while he or she is playing in it. Technically, Charbitat is  a modiﬁ cation of the Unreal engine used for 3D world presentation and inter- action, but whenever a new tile is needed, a parallel running Java application   coded by Calvin Ashmore  receives the variables from the game hero, gener- ates a height map in dependency to these player attributes and the surround- ing  tiles,  assembles  the  tiles  in  a  grid-like  map,  and  sends  the  information  back to the Unreal engine, where the actual 3D world is processed.  The result is an ever-expanding game universe—a feature unavailable in  physical space and outside Norberg-Schulz’s deﬁ nition. The challenges that  such a space poses are manifold. Apart from a whole range of gameplay issues,  we  faced  questions  such  as:  How  can  we  ﬁ nd  our  way  in  an  inﬁ nite  space?  How  can  we  structure  context  between  regions  in  this  world?  While  the  virtual bridge of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault is in danger of becoming an  arbitrary  variable,  the  same  rings  true  for  inﬁ nite  game  spaces  like  that  in  Charbitat. What started as an experimental game dealing with new forms of  3D space generation had to become a project about the generation of context  to avoid meaningless worlds. In the case of Charbitat, the content was arranged  in  procedurally  generated  key-lock  puzzles  that  form  basic  quests  used  to  block off some section of the world and send the player searching for the key  to overcome these thresholds  Ashmore 2006; Ashmore and Nitsche 2007 .  The positioning of thresholds and keys to overcome them evolved into a con- ditional network of structural elements for the player’s exploration of the game  world. Enemies populate the virtual stage and dramatize the progress further  and procedural camera work is applied to the spatial exploration.  Projects like Charbitat still refer to cultural spheres—in our case to refer- ences to Asian art and philosophy—but the space generation is player-driven   Chapter 10  168   instead of designer-dependent. Beyond making a space more precise, complement- ing  it,  and  realizing  it  as  a  symbol  and  cultural  object,  players  have  become  masters of experiential space itself as destruction and creation have become forms  of interaction on virtual space. Whether it is the virtual bridge in Medal of  Honor or the inﬁ nite game worlds of Charbitat, these titles still contextualize  their spaces, ﬁ lling them with evocative narrative elements and assisting forms  of presentation to support a meaningful ﬁ ctional plane on the player’s side.  Architectural Approaches  169    11  Examples of Spatial Structures   in Game Spaces  Even  if  players  gain  access  to  the  space-generation  process,  some  structure  has  to  be  provided  either  from  the  player  or  the  system.  A  number  of  signiﬁ cant  spatial  structures  will  be  discussed  in  this  chapter  to  specify  what  practical  shape  the  architectural  references  take  in  the  world  of  video  game  spaces.  These  structures  arrange  the  spatial  units  in  their  own  way:  paths,  edges,  and  regions,  as  well  as  the  use  of  textures,  vistas,  and  colors,  deﬁ ne their appearance and functionality. Based on the connection between  the spatial logic of architecture and its implementation in game worlds, this  chapter  closes  with  an  abstracted  model  for  space-driven  functionality.  In  many ways, this model is a large-scale version of the argument for evocative  narrative elements in game spaces, one that projects them into larger terrains  and levels.  “Playground” and “sandbox” are often used as metaphors for virtual spaces.  Both are useful to describe certain capabilities of video game spaces, and both  emphasize the placeness of game worlds. Yet these metaphors do not primarily  describe a spatial structure. The massively multiplayer online world of Second Life, for example, provides tools for its users to create their own structure on  patches  of  virtual  property.  The  world  functions  like  a  giant  sandbox  that  allows  its  inhabitants  to  form  structures  out  of  its  rule  system  and  already  existent objects. Similarly, a given environment such as Liberty City in Grand Theft Auto III is seen as a playground because its open architecture allows for  relatively free play. The differences between the two highlight the problems  of the metaphors: they do not refer to the structures  initially open virtual ﬂ at  terrain in Second Life versus a virtual city in Grand Theft Auto III  but focus  on their use, which is very different in both cases.   Another problematic spatial metaphor often used is the concept of a game  space as a garden. The garden itself has grown into a metaphor, most famously  perhaps  in  the  “Garden  of  Eden,”  and  the  word  has  long  spread  beyond  a  simple description of a somehow landscaped piece of land. “Gardens are rhe- torical landscapes”  Mitchell, Moore, and Turnbull 1988, 49  whose spatial  arrangements suggest a quality that is absent in truly natural landscapes. This  quality can differ widely. A garden of herbs serves a different purpose than a  botanical garden, or a sacred garden, or a representative garden, or a narrative  garden. These differences are implemented through different spatial designs.  On the one hand, the garden “is a place that embodies the spirit of humanity  in its association with nature”  Stein 1990, 40 . On the other, one might see  a form of garden in the temporal arrangement of cars on a parking lot, where  almost  every  aspect  is  controlled  by  human  construction   Groth  1990 .  A  garden can be the smallest possible unit, for example a balcony, or a national  park. In this way, a garden becomes a perceived quality itself. One person’s  dump might be another person’s garden.  As a result it is exceedingly difﬁ cult to determine a single spatial deﬁ nition  of the garden. There are a great number of guidelines for the construction of  gardens, from the Sakuteiki written in the eleventh century to the monthly  publication of Home & Garden today. Neither describes a single spatial struc- ture.  Instead,  gardens  offer  a  conceptual  ﬁ lter  through  which  one  might  experience space differently. They are individualistic pieces of art. The result- ing spaces are often described as prime examples of “places,” which is a quality  that will be discussed in more detail in chapter 12. The garden and sandbox  metaphors might not be very precise, but they are far from empty. Two ele- ments  of  gardens  are  the  completeness  of  their  microcosms  within  given  boundaries—which parallels the restrictions of a game world; and the gradual  revelation of their speciﬁ c quality through exploration—which resembles the  exploration  of  a  game  level   Gingold  2003;  L.  N.  Taylor  2006b .  Gardens  become the door into the introduction of architectural structure and debate  about the analysis of game space. Another door would be urban planning, for  example. Both suggest speciﬁ c uses of space and point to the value of spatial  structuring, but they do not suggest any precise spatial format.  11.1  Tracks and Rails  One distinguished spatial form in video games is the track. In its purest form  it is realized as a single axis. Although digital media allow instant teleporta- tion,  this  axis  and  the  movement  along  it  remain  important  enough  for  Benedikt  to  ask  for  a  “principle  of  transit”  for  cyberspace:  “This  principle   Chapter 11  172   states that travel between two points in cyberspace should occur phenomenally through  all intervening points, no matter how fast  save with inﬁ nite speed , and should incur  costs to the traveler proportional to some measure of the distance”  1991, 168; italics  in original .  The connection of points through movement in virtual space is elevated to  a principle structure of cyberspace itself. In practice, this axis is transformed,  twisted, and bent to structure movement along it. Racing games such as the  Gran Turismo series incorporate visible racetracks and reconstructions of exist- ing racecourses. The virtual levels mirror the real world’s spatial limitations  and  the  driving  experience.  They  might  simulate  weather  conditions,  indi- vidual tire behavior, or road conditions, but they always lack other important  elements of “real-world” racetrack design such as the safety of the spectators  or the context of the site, environmental suitability, or corrosion of the track  over time. They cannot aim for an architectural simulation but for a movement  simulation and the overall game space’s visceral impact. They reproduce the  racing  experience—the  fast-paced,  goal-oriented,  and  usually  competitive  striving to get ahead. Consequently, dominant features of the track focus on  this  visceral  experience  of  racing  space.  The  most  basic  racetracks  feature  straight lines with clear start and ﬁ nish lines. Early Olympic races, for example,  used stone markers to mark the starting point and end of a straight racetrack.  The track itself excludes any visual diversions, obstacles, or intersections. Even  competitors are conﬁ ned to their own subsection of the track to exclude any  interference. The structure aims to direct and conﬁ ne movement and demands  that the runner optimizes velocity and velocity only. “The racing track became  the  icon  of  modern  functionalism,  materializing  the  modern  belief  in  the  ‘natural’ hegemony of the straight line and the right angle. If this credo can  be called the modern religion, then racing is its ritual”  Eichberg 2004, 3 .  The racetrack itself is a cultural place, much as the ancient Olympic games  were a ritual that was tied to religious and spatial rites.  Oval  tracks  allow  for  a  continuous  race  but  keep  the  basic  restrictions.  Runners are only allowed to race on the designated path. Shortcuts or revers- ing direction at will are forbidden. The same applies to a pure video game  racetrack: players have to minimize the time by optimizing mastery of track  and interaction with the vehicle in Gran Turismo 4  Yamauchi 2004  or Grand Prix Legends  Cassidy et al. 1998  to win a race—not unlike a real racing driver.  Players  hardly  notice  the  amazing  backdrops  of  a  track  or  the  high-detail  textures of the road in the latest Gran Turismo installment. They always strive  forward to a destination beyond the current position.  The precision of any physical simulation in a game world is optional. The  racing cars of Grand Prix Legends might attempt the accurate reproduction of   Examples of Spatial Structures in Game Spaces  173   Figure  11.1 Wipeout XL   Burcombe  1996 :  the  Gare  D’Europe  racetrack   left ; Wipeout  XL in-game view  right   the historic engines but the hovering spaceship racers of the Wipeout or F-Zero series replace the Formula 1 physics with far less realistic models. Where they  lack the necessary physical involvement that provided the tension in the real- istic track design, they add a range of other features to the track to increase  dramatic engagement. These include a ﬂ urry of bright colors to increase the  perception of speed, twisted tracks not unlike those of a rollercoaster, exag- gerated sound design, and far jumps to emphasize speed.  This  results  in  different  layouts  for  the  necessary  racetracks.  While  real  Formula 1 tracks have to consider the limitations of the cars and conditions  for the site, the new racing vehicles allow for new spatial layouts. Because the  racing ships in Wipeout allow spectacular jumps, gaps appear; their ability for  sudden turns allows an increase in sharp curves; looping and extreme deforma- tions of the track became available; the absence of audiences led to ﬂ oating  tracks through futuristic environments. Despite all those changes, the basic  premise of the race is kept intact: that of competitive spatial advance along a  strictly predeﬁ ned track. In many ways the unrealistic racing games are more  elaborate in their spatial adaptation of the race experience than their “realistic”  counterparts.  The  games  might  not  be  able  to  realize  the  factual  physical  racing components, but their tracks are designed to balance this through an  emphasis  on  a  spectacular  restaging  of  the  racing  experience.  These  racing  games remediate the racetrack into the virtual. Their track layouts emphasize  moves  such  as  drifting,  jumping,  and  sliding,  to  capture,  intensify,  and  lengthen key racing moments.  But  games  have  adopted  the  metaphor  of  the  track  also  in  other  form.  So-called  rail-shooters  move  or  guide  the  player  along  invisible  tracks  that   Chapter 11  174   allow  little  divergence  from  a  given  path.  The  world  might  appear  to  be  accessible but can be navigated only in the conﬁ nes of a very limited set track.  Because this track’s layout might not be clear initially to the player, this kind  of  approach  includes  an  element  of  discovery.  It  is  a  guided  journey  along  which the individual points are important. As a result, the game space changes  completely.  Instead  of  the  highly  functional  and  obviously  restricting  race- track,  the  invisible  rail  often  uses  a  range  of  methods  to  engage  the  player  with the track itself. These structures keep the rail interesting and engaging  instead  of  pointing  only  to  the  goal.  In  one  obvious  racetrack  design,  the  position of other competitors during a race is immediately visible. No obsta- cles are in place and no divergence from the given path is allowed. Invisible  rails  add  excitement  to  the  game  experience  by  breaking  these  rules  and  guiding  the  player  along  some  form  of  interactive  theme-park  attraction.  Variations  might  occur,  but  the  spatial  design  for  the  de  facto  exploration  remains limited. Any player of the early Medal of Honor titles is taken on a  ride along prescripted events and battles that demand not sheer speed but a  range of different interactions. Speed might be part of the equation and time  limits  might  apply,  but  time  is  not  the  single  most  important  value.  The  game world is not optimized for velocity alone but for a variety of interactions.  The track turns into something like an adventure obstacle course.  What emerges, in the case of Medal of Honor, is a new primary objective:  exploration and survival in an often highly dramatized environment. Visibility  can change constantly through the use of dynamic presentation and the func- tionality, and conditions of the game space change constantly too as objects  appear and pathways change. Developers restrict players’ progress to a given  path   or  limited  paths   to  manage  the  complexity  of  these  encounters  and  arrange them as dramatically as possible. But the restrictions are not simply  production-driven, unwanted necessitites but can be used as valuable struc- tural directives. In my battles through Medal of Honor’s World War II scenario  I ﬁ nd my way blocked by mineﬁ elds, ripped open by explosions, and hidden  in a fog of war. These limitations can provide valuable structure for a player’s  experience.  Krzywinska  has  pointed  out  that  “through  the  juxtaposition  of  being  in  and  out  of  control,  horror-based  videogames  facilitate  the  visceral  and oscillating pleasures unpleasures of anxiety and expectation”  2002, 217 .  She expands the question of control to horror-speciﬁ c conditions but the same  basic juxtaposition is at work in Medal of Honor. Being tied to the path of fate  through the game world might restrict the player’s impact on the world as  such, but it is a valuable part of shaping the player’s involvement.  Galyean  suggested  an  abstract  concept  of  a  possible  spatial  structure  for  narrative  in  virtual  spaces.  He  distinguishes  between  a  “plot  level,”   Examples of Spatial Structures in Game Spaces  175   “presentation level,” and “viewer level” in his design approach. The plot level  contains  the  “high  level  goals,  intentions,  and  events  of  the  story”  and  is  detached from the rest of the environment  1995, 31 . He suggests a “river  analogy” to shape the events effectively on the plot level: “Instead of linking  a sequence or branches and nodes, I suggest that paths through a narrative be  more like a river ﬂ owing through a landscape. The audience is a boat ﬂ oating  down this river with some latitude and control, while also being pushed and  pulled by the predeﬁ ned ﬂ ow of the water.  .  .  .  This constrains the user to stay  within the banks of the river while giving him her the ability for continuous  interaction”  ibid., 58–59 .  Although  the  river  is  introduced  as  an  analogy  and  not  necessarily  as  a  direct spatial structure, it implies spatial structuring of the exploration along  a  limited  number  of  given  path s .  One  does  not  know  where  the  journey  might end and how to master the surprises behind the next bend of the river  because the structure and the ingredients of the space might change at any  given moment.  The  restrictions  of  tracks  and  rails  might  affect  the  range  of  available  choices and restrict interactive access to a shadow of its potential, but if the  restriction is a meaningful part of the desired experience, then these spatial  forms  offer  valid  structural  means  to  the  game  world.  Whether  they  show  their structure through enhanced visual cues, as in the Wipeout series, or hide  them with even more visual distractions, as in the Medal of Honor series, tracks  implement  a  guiding  force  in  the  game  world.  The  interaction  with  this  structure  can  vary  from  sheer  speed  to  gradual  exploration,  but  the  spatial  construct allows for a dramatic shaping of this interaction. This is the differ- ence between the jumps in Wipeout and the unexpected yet prescripted events  in Medal of Honor. Tracks thus can locate the spatiotemporal conditions for  any  such  appearance  very  precisely  as  they  restrict  exploration  beyond  the  given boundaries. They map a dramatic structure onto lines.  11.2  Labyrinths and Mazes  The  growing  complexity  of  track  arrangements  leads  into  the  discussion  of  another  important  spatial  form  in  digital  media:  the  labyrinth.  Labyrinths  play  with  the  notion  of  hierarchy  as  they  lack  outstanding  visual  cues  that  can support orientation and instead often feature repetitive rhythms of recur- ring patterns. At the same time, and unlike the hidden rails of Medal of Honor, the  labyrinth  usually  puts  its  restriction  on  display.  Exceptions  are  mirror- and-glass mazes where even the walls have to be found. Architectural theorist  Kevin Lynch agrees that exploration of the unknown—as seen in the hidden   Chapter 11  176   rails and the labyrinth’s paths—can provide joy: “This is so, however, only  under two conditions. First, there must be no danger of losing basic form or  orientation,  of  never  coming  out.  The  surprise  must  occur  in  an  over-all  framework; the confusions must be small regions in a visible whole. Further- more,  the  labyrinth  or  mystery  must  in  itself  have  some  form  that  can  be  explored and in time be apprehended. Complete chaos without hint of con- nection is never pleasurable”  1960, 5–6 .  As with the design of tracks, the spatial arrangement of the labyrinth needs  structure to be pleasurable. Eco argued that there are three types of labyrinths,  to which this chapter adds a fourth type:   cid:2   The linear or unicursal labyrinth that consists of one single path.  cid:2   The maze that offers branching and multicursal forms.  cid:2   The net or rhizome in which each point can be connected to any other point   Eco 1984 .  cid:2   The logic maze, a conditional maze that depends on changing access condi- tions that shape the available space.  As  will  be  explained  in  the  following  paragraphs,  the  three  ﬁ rst  forms  coexist in video game spaces and apply spatial structure to position narrative  elements within them. This effect will be illustrated in a discussion of the video  game Zanzarah: The Hidden Portal  Nitsche 2002 . I was involved in the title’s  production and had full access to the design documents. This allows a complete  look at the construction of the game’s space beyond the player’s experience and  into the factual maps and level design decisions  Nitsche 2007b .  The dramatic setting of Zanzarah: The Hidden Portal mirrors many other  fantasy settings for video games, movies, and novels. I control a teenage girl,  Amy, who has been called from her “real” home in London to save a magical   Figure  11.2  Unicursal:  Chartres  cathedral,  twelfth-  to  thirteenth-century  labyrinth   left ;  multicursal: Hampton Court maze, planted 1702  right   Examples of Spatial Structures in Game Spaces  177   parallel world: Zanzarah. While exploring the game universe, I realize that  the overall game world is divided into three main sections:  1  the London  “reality”;  2  the magic quest world of Zanzarah; and  3  the separate world  of the virtual fairies, which can be accessed via the quest world. Throughout  the overall quest I ﬁ nd hints that ﬂ esh out an underlying backstory. It seems  that these three worlds were once united but got separated. Their discontinu- ity is the source of all evil. The main objective for Amy and me is to reunite  the separated worlds through her unique ability to access all of them and ﬁ ght  evil on every level.  Zanzarah’s main game world, which hosts the central quest, is an example  of  a  multicursal  maze  where  players  can  explore  the  world  freely  but  may  become  lost.  These  levels  include  forests,  gardens,  or  cave  structures  that  provide ample opportunity to lose one’s way. In these levels, the player meets  various evocative narrative elements such as characters, thresholds, and useful  objects. Their arrangement within the maze provides a certain structure for  the player’s exploration and sets new directions. The game often sends players  on extended searches and they have to retrace their steps and return to former  locations, crisscrossing paths already taken as they progress.  In order to progress through the game, I have to fulﬁ ll certain tasks that  unlock  more  options  within  a  growing  network  of  accessible  locations.  In  many ways, this arrangement of narrative elements presents a unicursal path  overlaid onto the maze. Their conditional combination is the main quest the  designer has envisioned for an “implied player.” Although not strictly linear— there  are  parallel  options tracks  available  and  manifold  distractions—this  projected quest winds through the world with many elements of a unicursal  path.  A  simple  walk-through  would  document  this  path’s  various  twists  and turns and force it into a linear description. In practice, players have to   Figure  11.3 Zanzarah  design  document:  excerpt  of  the  rule-deﬁ ned  game  space   left ;  in- game map  right   Chapter 11  178   constantly negotiate whether to strictly follow this solution or divert from the  main  quest  and  explore  more  options.  Occasionally,  it  is  even  necessary  to  leave the main path. Amy’s ﬁ ghting powers depend on the development of  all the fairies she collects during her travels through Zanzarah. These fairies  start  off  as  weak  low-level  characters  but  can  be  developed  and  improved  through continued training and ﬁ ghting. Certain faerie conditions can be the  key to overcoming a speciﬁ c obstacle or hostile enemy character; thus I have  to increase my faerie arsenal. The best way to do that is to roam through the  game world sections that have been unlocked so far and ﬁ nd new challenges  and ﬁ ghts to train my fairies. I have to divert from the main quest to reach a  certain condition in order to proceed.  At other occasions, players might be confused about what the central quest  is  and  diverge  into  different  adventures.  The  preimplanted  quest  might  be  seen as Ariadne’s thread laid out by the designer through the game world and  picked up by the player—or left aside.  Information  and  evocative  elements  are  spread  in  a  certain  pattern  that  helps to shape the gaming experience. Using maze-like structures was a logical  consequence  of  the  gameplay  implementation.  Zanzarah  certainly  did  not  follow a fundamental pattern or academic framework but was implemented  with a “gut feeling” for what seemed right and feasible.  As  discussed  earlier,  the  monomyth  is  one  possible  guideline  for  such  a  shape. Zanzarah, like many other titles, includes key elements of this unicursal  pattern. The separation between the “real” London and the “fantastic” world  of magic simulates the passing into the world of the adventure, the design  document mainly assembles thresholds that have to be overcome with the help  of either certain abilities or items, many non-player characters have speciﬁ c  pieces of information to help the player locate the preplanned quest, and the  ultimate  reward  in  Zanzarah  is  the  reconnection  of  the  separated  worlds— a healing of the initial wound. To clarify: these are the preplanned evocative  elements  and  not  the  game’s  “story.”  Any  player’s  personal  experience  and  narrative comprehension of the game world differs from this path and is gen- erated only through individual play. However, the reference to monomythical  motifs in the layout of the pre-envisioned quest illustrates how designers can  map one on the other.  Finally,  Zanzarah  also  offers  a  reference  to  the  concept  of  the  net  in  the  quest  world’s  connection  with  the  numerous  battles  that  happen  along  the way. Every battle is staged within closed environments that are part of  the third section in the game: the fairy realm. Players access these spatially  distinct  pockets  via  teleportation  and  have  to  face  enemy  characters  in  a  ﬁ rst-person shooter setting.  Examples of Spatial Structures in Game Spaces  179   Figure 11.4 Zanzarah  design document excerpt  illustrating quests within the game world:  curved lines indicate origin of a quest and the area that allows for its completion; icons rep- resent speciﬁ c entities such as characters, treasures, and blocking threshold guardians  I steer Amy past an unsuspicious rock formation in the Northern icy lands  of Zanzarah, when a tiny aggressive faerie jumps right out of the solid virtual  rock and challenges me. If I accept the challenge the camera follows the fairy  as she returns back into the virtual rock. The control scheme changes from  the  exploring  Amy  to  the  ﬁ ghting  fairies,  and  I  ﬁ nd  myself  in  a  different  subworld that seems to be somehow interwoven with the main quest world.  Depending on the outcome of the ﬁ ght, I am teleported back into the quest  world or the “real” world of the London home.  Teleportation  and  the  almost  arbitrary  encounter  of  the  battle  arenas  in  the  quest  world  carry  the  notion  of  the  net,  where  any  point  of  the  world  can be connected to any other location. Notably, all three labyrinthine forms  exist  in  parallel  and  players  have  to  travel  through  all  of  them  in  order  to  play Zanzarah to its full extent. This parallel use of the various forms answers  to  Aarseth’s  call  for  a  reformulation  of  the  labyrinth  in  digital  interactive  media   1997,  5–9 .  Aarseth  refers  to  Doob   1990   when  he  suggests  that  parallel  use  of  different  labyrinthine  forms  points  back  to  older  medieval  interpretations  of  the  concept  of  the  labyrinth.  Any  player  of  Zanzarah encounters a similar spatial understanding through the sheer multiplicity of   Chapter 11  180   the maze formats. How Zanzarah’s game space interconnects paths, connec- tions, and single locations points to the concept of “striated” and “smooth”  spaces.  Deleuze  and  Guattari  established  a  distinction  into  striated  and  smooth  space illustrated by the different tokens of two board games: “The ‘smooth’  space of Go, as against the ‘striated’ space of chess.  .  .  .  The difference is that  chess  codes  and  decodes  space,  whereas  Go  proceeds  altogether  differently,  territorializing or deterritorializing it”  Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 353 . An  important difference is their understanding of lines and points: “The smooth  and the striated are distinguished ﬁ rst of all by an inverse relation between  the  point  and  the  line   in  the  case  of  the  striated,  the  line  is  between  two  points, while in the smooth, the point is between two lines ”  ibid., 480 . The  principles of smooth and striated are applied to a wide variety of ﬁ elds, includ- ing presentation  “Smooth is both the object of a close vision par excellence  and the element of a haptic space.  .  .  .  Striated, on the contrary, relates to a  more distant vision, and a more optical space” [ibid., 493] , music, and navi- gation  ibid., 477 . They grow from and feed into a wider discussion of social  phenomena.  Borrowing the initial distinction, one can observe that a game world like  Zanzarah’s  combines  both  types.  It  demands  a  player  to  constantly  switch  from  one  spatial  approach  to  another.  This  ﬂ exibility  is  fully  expected  by  Deleuze and Guattari, who envisioned both spatial concepts in constant transi- tion into each other. It has also been traced in other games like Civilization  L. N. Taylor 2006a , and Ryan comes to a comparable conclusion for hyper- text  2001b, 262 . Again, the constant renegotiation of the player’s position  is key and the multilayered quality of the game space opens it up for dynamic  engagement.  Supporting this openness, each world in Zanzarah can itself become a nar- rative element, a distinct part of the player’s experience. All three worlds offer  not only different interactive features but are also presented in different ways.  The “real” London home is a form of player inventory where important ele- ments are stored and have to be picked up to continue the game. It is presented  in sepia colors and the camera is a typical following camera that also affects  the  directional  movement  of  the  avatar.  The  “quest”  world  uses  the  same  camera  but  offers  the  main  narrative  elements  in  the  form  of  characters,  puzzles, thresholds, and collectible items. It is presented in full color. Finally,  the “battle” sections switch the player to a ﬁ rst-person point of view and lack  any quest elements. They concentrate entirely on the ﬁ ghting action. These  battle  locations  in  Zanzarah  differ  signiﬁ cantly  from  the  labyrinthine  structures and take more the form of arenas.  Examples of Spatial Structures in Game Spaces  181   The  quality  of  any  labyrinth  or  maze  is  also  dependent  on  the  form  of  its  presentation.  In  classical  architectural  labyrinths  and  mazes  Ching’s  visual properties  “shape size color texture position orientation visual inertia”  [1979, 51]  exist, often in monotonous repetition without signiﬁ cant differ- entiation, and spatial cues are minimized  as in mirror or glass mazes . This  is what complicates the reading of the space and makes navigation in a laby- rinth so difﬁ cult.  Because  game  spaces  depend  on  the  camera,  the  legibility  of  any  maze,  thus, also depends on the camera work. The hallways of DOOM are reduced  to 2D labyrinths presented in a 3D ﬁ rst-person point of view from within the  maze. Once the camera delivers an all-revealing overhead view of the structure   see, e.g., in Pac-Man , the function of the structure changes. Switching the  camera from the ﬁ rst-person point of view to the overhead navigable map view  in DOOM   as  outlined  in  chapter  7   also  changes  the  space  from  a  clearly  forward-directed trajectory through the corridors to an all-including regional  overview. Smooth and striated meet again in this constant double-exploration  of the game world.  The Pac-Man  maze  is  experienced  in  its  whole  condition  at  once,  which  mirrors the representation in arenas that often have wide-open vistas that try  to  simplify  the  spatial  perception.  In  the  arena  the  task  is  to  solve  a  set  problem, such as a ﬁ ght, a dance, or some other form of skillful performance.  The  presentation  of  the  skill  dominates  over  a  less  predictable  exploration  of  space.  A  labyrinth,  shown  in  an  overhead  view,  mimics  this  focus  on  skills and reduction of spatial exploration because every path is revealed, no  surprises lurk behind dark corners. The task in a labyrinth, shown in an over- head view, is comparable because every path is revealed. Players cannot get  lost; instead the game space becomes a puzzle to solve with all pieces visible  and  all  paths  laid  out.  The  challenge  is  the  best  possible  performance  in  a  fully presented space.  Logic or multistate mazes address this challenge and complicate it through  logical puzzles. One does not solve the task simply by navigating or dealing  with some objectives encountered in the space, but through careful analysis  of the implemented conditions between spaces as such  Pegg 2003 . The laby- rinth game space is completely revealed but is a complex puzzle in itself that  needs to be processed. Consequently, the various forms that these puzzles can  take have been used for learning  Madden and Howley 2003 , and embedded  in their logical systems one can ﬁ nd computational problem-solving strategies   Hearn 2006 .  Roger Abbott, a pioneer of the logic maze, created multistate walk-through  mazes  as  navigable  attractions.  Notably,  one  of  his  references  for  the  logic   Chapter 11  182   maze  is  the  “Colossal  Cave”  game  space  of  the  original  Adventure  with  its  conditional linking and the option for changing conditions  for discussions of  Adventure, see, e.g., Nelson 1995 or Jerz 2007 . Indeed, the conditions of the  mazes  remind  one  of  hypertextual  node  structures,  as  seen,  for  example,  in  Abbott’s Bureaucratic  Maze   2003 .  The  maze  is  built  around  ﬁ ve  physical  desks located in an open room—like spatial nodes on a free playing ﬁ eld. Each  desk has an own label.  When you enter the maze you are given a form that says, “Take this to the desk labeled  Human Resources.” You look for the desk with the nameplate Human Resources, you hand  in your form to the bureaucrat at that desk, and he gives you another form. This one  says, “Take this form to Information Management or Marketing.” Hmm, there is now a  choice. Let’s say you decide to go to Information Management. You hand in your form  and receive one that says, “Take this form to Employee Beneﬁ ts or Marketing.” You decide  on Employee Beneﬁ ts where you receive a form saying, “Take this form to Corporate Compliance or Human Resources.”  Abbott 2005   Labyrinths  emerge  not  only  as  structures  that  form  one  typical  form  of  game levels, but also as results of the exploration of virtual space. The virtual  journeys of players criss-crossing the available space can be interpreted as the  creation process of a labyrinth of experienced locations. Their movements form  a spatial practice, and this practice leads to a labyrinthine space. To keep this  structure as dynamic as Abbott suggests, these game worlds need to be highly  procedural. The procedural world generation in Charbitat, for example, might  be able to provide the necessary complexity and dynamic world. The narrative  model of the quest emerges again from the conditions that structure the move- ment that are spatially restricted and thereby shape the player’s experience.  As such, labyrinths remain compact, evocative narrative environments.  11.3  Arenas  Arenas are mostly open structures with one dominating demarcation line: the  surrounding enclosement, which is essentially a datum in Ching’s deﬁ nition.  In contrast to the labyrinth, they feature few visual clues that draw attention  to  the  place  as  such.  Instead,  they  provide  the  canvas  for  a  performance.  Whether it is a football pitch, a boxing ring, or the coliseum, arenas provide  relatively free movement in a contained space with high visibility, while laby- rinths restrain movement to a complex space that complicates comprehension.  As  a  result,  the  arena’s  spatial  arrangement  often  supports  events  such  as  battles, dances, or speeches that demand skillful operation of the avatar, often  in  collaboration  or  competition  with  others.  Stone,  for  example,  highlights   Examples of Spatial Structures in Game Spaces  183   arenas’  value  when  she  refers  to  video  games  as  “arenas  for  social  experience”  1998, 15; italics in original . In contrast, the space of the labyrinth can itself  become the very opponent to overcome, and individual mastery of the maze  can dominate any social engagement.  We cannot simplify the labyrinth as solely a challenge to the individual  and  the  arena  as  strictly  a  place  for  social  activity.  Too  many  cooperation  modes in games from Gauntlet  Porter 1985  to Dungeon Siege  C. Taylor 2002   engage  players  in  co-op  play  in  the  exploration  and  conquest  of  mazes  and  labyrinths. But arenas display their own spatial intricacies.  In Zanzarah arenas are used to stage the ﬁ ghting sequences. They are sepa- rate  locations  outside  the  quest  world  with  a  different  interaction  design.  Multiplayer functionality is reduced to these arenas, and players meet in only  these secluded environments to prove their mastery in ongoing battles.  Arenas’  spatial  conditions  differ  wildly  from  labyrinths  or  tracks.  Laby- rinths offer few orientating reference points in a repetitive and disorientating  structure;  pure  racetracks  offer  little  else  but  these  orientation  points  that  mark  start  and  end  position,  invisible  rails  hide  their  own  shape  behind  numerous of those markers along the way. However, a virtual arena is often  less  exploratory  and  more  of  a  contained  location.  Arenas  in  games  either  reduce  their  functionality  to  a  sheer  backdrop   as  seen,  for  example  in  the  arenas of many classic ﬁ ghting games such as Tekken or Virtua Fighter , or they  include  objects  in  their  design  that  follow  speciﬁ c  rules  to  address  spatial  balance. A game such as Quake III: Arena can become frustrating if one player  or  one  team  gains  an  unfair  advantage  through  spatial  design.  Instead,  no  player is allowed to get a lead over another through the game world alone.  All players in a Quake III: Arena match have to be able to reach the supporting  items in time and use them. Height condition, visibility patterns, distances  to objects—every element of spatial design is balanced.  The result can be a kind of mirrored game world where both sides start at  opposing, yet equally designed ends of a map to guarantee a fair setup. Quake III’s map The Longest Yard is a “capture the ﬂ ag” environment in which two  opposing teams of players try to reach the base of the other team, steal their  ﬂ ag, and bring it to their own base. Collaboration and individual skills during  the attack are the keys to success, as neither side has any advantage over the  other in the architecture of the game world. The Longest Yard map even fea- tures  equal  lighting  conditions  to  balance  visibility.  Both  sides  have  main  lights  at  their  bases;  no  player  can  hide  in  a  speciﬁ c  shadow  spot  or  sneak  through hidden passages. At the same time, the level consists of numerous  jumping pads and small platforms ﬂ oating in open space. Any navigation error  is immediately punished with certain virtual death, and mastery of space is a   Chapter 11  184   Figure 11.5 Zanzarah: a spatially restricted battle arena  left ; the open spaces of the quest  world  right   necessity. This game world is a classic arena combined with spatial challenges  that are meticulously balanced.  But balancing a map does not depend on such mirrored spatial conditions.  The  most  acknowledged,  most  played  maps  of  the  Half-Life  modiﬁ cation  Counter-Strike  are  not  symmetrical.  These  structurally  unequal  maps  can  be  balanced  through  different  objects  and  objectives  within  the  map.  How  to  balance  level  design  has  been  the  point  of  many  debates  not  only  between  players but also creators  Tagliaferri 1996  and analysts  Bartle 2004; Byrne  2005 . The balance of these complex arenas is ultimately a work of art that  emerges from the game design process. The different forms of balancing can  be illustrated with basic differences in spatial design in Quake III’s “capture  the ﬂ ag” mode and Counter-Strike.  Both  games  pose  two  teams  in  opposition  to  each  other,  navigating  the game world to reach certain locations and fulﬁ ll certain tasks there. The Longest Yard sets them up as opposing teams with exactly the same task for  both sides. In contrast, Counter-Strike divides the teams into one of counter- terrorists and one of terrorists with different objectives to achieve against each  other. Where counter-terrorists have to inﬁ ltrate the hijackers’ hideout, free  the  virtual  hostages,  and  lead  them  to  safety,  terrorists  have  to  hold  their  position and keep their hostages captive; where terrorist have to attack, plant  a bomb in a designated area, and prevent counter-terrorists from defusing it,  counter-terrorists have to prevent this undertaking; where counter-terrorists  have to guide a single virtual VIP to a safe spot, terrorists constantly ambush  their attempts. Counter-Strike teams have opposing goals but not diametrically  so. The level structures incorporate these differences. Consequently, they do  not offer any mirrored stages but balance the spatial interaction asymmetri- cally. Access, visibility, and navigability are variable throughout the environ-  Examples of Spatial Structures in Game Spaces  185   Figure 11.6 Quake III: Arena in the The Longest Yard map; mirrored spatial structures for  opposing teams  ment and far from symmetrical. For example, terrorists hold hostages usually  in virtual interiors and the counter-terrorist coming to the rescue often has  to  pass  some  open  territory  to  get  there,  often  exposed  to  virtual  snipers.  Alternative  routes  might  be  single-path  structures  that  can  become  central  choke points of condensed action.  The cs_militia map of Counter-Strike was created by Andrew Aumann and  uses  a  hostage-rescue  setting.  It  clearly  can  be  dissected  into  tracks,  open  arena-like spaces, and even small maze-like interiors that illustrate the dynam- ics  of  such  an  asymmetrical  map.  In  contrast,  players  of  Quake  III:  Arena’s The Longest Yard always start with the same predisposition, the same opposing  goal,  and  the  same  spatial  conﬁ guration.  Tactics  in  The  Longest  Yard still depend on spatial design. For example, the level features special sniping  platforms,  but  this  design  is  equal  on  both  ends  of  the  map,  and  action  differs  because  of  varying  spatial  behavior  not  because  of  asymmetric  level  architecture.  The  Longest  Yard  might  be  a  clearer  arena  structure  than  cs_militia,  but  experienced  players  of  both  maps  know  the  spaces  in  great  detail.  Because  these maps are played again and again, neither offers any exploration or sur- prising  details  after  the  initial  encounters.  Thus,  a  player’s  approach  to  cs_  Chapter 11  186   Figure 11.7 Counter-Strike: a simpliﬁ ed view of the cs_militia map ground level and tunnel  system  militia mirrors an arena principle, although its structure is a mixture of various  forms. Where the gaming condition is not equal, there the spatial conditions  must not be equal or they would continuously favor one side.  11.4  Driven by Space  So  far,  architectural  structures  have  been  combined  from  the  smallest  possible level  see Ching 1979  to the larger contextualization of space  see  Norberg-Schulz 1980 . Tracks rails, labyrinths mazes, and arenas come to life  through  these  architectural  details  and  foster  certain  forms  of  interaction.  While  this  arrangement  might  not  be  complete—for  example,  a  different  argument  might  work  at  the  level  of  the  room  and  house  and  concentrate  more  on  relations  of  inside  and  outside—it  nevertheless  provides  a  set  of  spatial patterns.  Through such patterning, space structures the evocative narrative elements  and a player’s experience of them. This space dependency might be called the  space-driven  model  for  content  assembly.  It  provides  an  abstract  model  for  space  as  the  structural  force  of  interactive  events.  Here,  the  virtual  stage  becomes a canvas, and the structures used within it, the tracks, rails, mazes,  arenas, or others, are large-scale evocative narrative elements. Logical connec- tions are still crucial but are combined with their spatial context.  The  space-driven  model  for  content  structuring  tries  to  simplify  and  abstract the phenomena outlined in sections 11.1 to 11.3 to search for a way  of designing new game worlds and analyzing and evaluating existing models.  Spatial  logic  is  seen  as  an  additional  guiding  force  for  behavior  and  can  be   Examples of Spatial Structures in Game Spaces  187   applied to exploit the narrative potential of virtual spaces. The focus here is  on  the  use  of  space  that  shapes  possible  events  and  their  visualization.  In  contrast to physical space, where architects can hope to incorporate features  that evoke connotations and patterns of behavior in visitors, game designers  can shape the functionality available at any given location more directly and  therefore determine more precisely the characteristics of the event space.  Possibilities  of  engagement  are  directly  built  into  the  spatial  structure.  They are “emplaced,” as Foucault would have argued  1998 , by their distance  and relation to each other. Through emplacement, a game world designer can  create  what  Warren  Spector  termed  “possibility  spaces”   see  Jenkins  and  Squire 2002, 70  in a spatial sense. These provide intriguing problems and  tasks as well as means to solve these problems and complete the tasks. The  concept  of  the  possibility  space  originated  in  math  and  is  here  applied  to  virtual architecture. In this case, a possibility space describes the options made  available to the player through spatial conditions at a given moment in the  game experience. The deeper such a possibility space is, the more options are  provided. These options can be realized by the player into actions.  Heim  argues  along  the  same  lines,  stating  that  a  “good  virtual  environ- ment  .  .  .  is not an object seen in and for itself but an environment that blends  into the user’s activities”  2001, 6 . Heim argues for an active spatial structure  that provides the interaction with an “atmospheric ﬂ ow,” which, according to  him,  can  inﬂ uence  user  behavior.  Heim  exempliﬁ es  his  statement  with  the  online worlds of V-Zones  n.n. 1995–  and Active Worlds  n.n. 1995–; Heim  2001 .  However,  both  of  these  platforms  are  technically  limited  in  their  “blending”  into  user  activities  and  are  not  goal-driven  games  but  environ- ments for communication and virtual meetings. More goal-related environ- ments often use stronger spatial structuring.  To provide a simple example, one can refer back to Norberg-Schulz’s and  Heidegger’s  example  of  the  bridge.  Bridges  can  be  found  in  many  game  worlds, although gravity is optional and bridges could be one of those struc- tures that become obsolete once characters can ﬂ y or jump over any obstacle.  Instead, they often have been adapted as spatial structural objects to channel  interaction. A virtual bridge’s positioning, creation, and use become variables  as the building process, uncovering, and usability of such a structure become  conditions of the dramatic setting of the game, as seen in the preceding Medal of  Honor  case.  Here,  we  will  add  another  game  realization  of  a  bridge  structure.  In The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask  Miyamoto 2000 , I will eventually  direct my exploring and questing hero-character to a bridge that cannot be  crossed because of a constant wind that blows me over the edge. Only after I   Chapter 11  188   have resolved more quests and found more items to improve my abilities can  I use those new features that reveal to me the source of the problem: a giant  becomes visible whose breath causes the wind. I have to deal with this obstacle  before I can use the bridge as a path. The spatial design and the conditions  that regulate access to the bridge are evocative narrative elements that demand  and  structure  further  exploration  of  the  virtual  space.  In  Medal  of  Honor  I  defend the structure itself in a single and distinct level, while in The Legend  of Zelda: Majora’s Mask I experience it as one spatial element in a continuous  world that consists of a tightly woven net of evocative narrative elements.  Ultimately, the space-driven model provides an abstraction of the spatial  structures discussed, but it helps to highlight space’s importance in the cre- ation and management of any “possibility space” that otherwise might be seen  as a merely conditional, rule-based interaction design question. Rules of the  game can be written into the playing ﬁ eld, and when game space is structured,  rules are structured to shape possible actions in this environment. To high- light  and  contextualize  this  simple  but  important  fact  requires  the  spatial  model.  Examples of Spatial Structures in Game Spaces  189    12  Virtual Places  Virtual space is a product of human knowledge and depends on logic, soft- ware, and hardware development. It lacks geographical, zoological, and most  physical  dependencies  that  heavily  impact  real-world  locations.  A  digital  space has no immediate context with other surrounding spaces because it can  be developed separately from them, independently from building regulations  or limitations in terms of height, depth, or width. It is a world deﬁ ned by  a universe of coordinates. That is why at its core and at the moment of its  creation, it is spatial but not a place.  In order for these data visualizations to become meaningful, they have to  be  engaged  by  the  player.  Through  the  active  work  of  the  player,  through  comprehension  and  interaction,  the  masses  of  polygons  can  transform  into  places. A genius loci is often deﬁ ned by subjective experience of the location.  To establish some measure, three indicators for placeness are suggested: iden- tity, self-motivated and self-organized action, and traces of memory. All three  have  been  discussed  as  signiﬁ cant  issues  in  the  creation  of  placeness  in  the  “real”  world  and  should  provide  an  entry  point  into  the  discussion  of  the  virtual place.  12.1  Identity and Place  Laurel argues that in order to reach “Virtual Reality’s highest potential, we  must reinvent the sacred spaces where we collaborate with reality in order to  transform it and ourselves”  1993, 197 . Laurel strives for a placeness through  sacredness in virtual worlds as deﬁ ned by Eliade  1987 . This approach drove  her Placeholder  project  that  allowed  interactors  to  enter  a  mythical  space,  ﬁ lled with symbols and narrative motifs relating to aboriginal culture. The    importance of virtual worlds for sacred concepts has been debated since the  early days of cyberspace enthusiasm  Benedikt 1991 , and Wertheim reveals  that religious and pseudoreligious elements are quickly established in cyber- space’s promise of the “New Jerusalem”  2000, 255 . Such promises of virtual  heavens occasionally can ﬁ lter through into perceptions of the physical world. At times, these promises are taken too literally: A group around Yitzhak  Hayut-Man plans to recreate the historic Third Temple as a holographic pro- jection hovering over the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Their idea builds on  religious  tradition  in  the  waiting  for  the  coming  Messiah.  Massive  laser  cannons are supposed to project a 3D image of the virtual temple in the sky  above the Dome of Rock, beaming the “heavenly Jerusalem” into the sky over  the real, existing city. Although religious as well as technological leaders shun  the plans, the vision as such is an example for the still-vibrant hope for the  power of a heavenly virtual world. At the same time, it is an example of a  view that is detached from the traditional understanding of a physical place. In physical space, the quality of  sacred  placeness is a holistic principle.  According to Norberg-Schulz, the term describes the perceived meaning and  quality of all the elements that form the place: “We mean a totality made up  of concrete things having material substance, shape, texture and color. Together  these things determine an ‘environmental character,’ which is the essence of  place. In general, a place is given as such a character or ‘atmosphere.’ A place  is therefore a qualitative, ‘total’ phenomenon, which we cannot reduce to any  of  its  properties,  such  as  spatial  relationships,  without  losing  its  concrete  nature out of sight”  1980, 6 and 8 .  He basically reapplies Heidegger in this case, noting that places are funda- mentally important for man’s dwelling and “his identity depends on his belong- ing  to  places”   ibid.,  6 .  The  spatial  structure  of  any  place  not  only  has  to  facilitate orientation within it but also has to contain “concrete objects of iden- tiﬁ cation”  ibid., 21 . As Norberg-Schulz argues, “human identity presupposes the  identity  of  place”   ibid.,  22;  italics  in  original .  This  connection  of  space  and  identity  provides  a  basis  for  identifying  placeness  in  virtual  worlds  through  virtual personae. It is the basis for the argument about identity in video game  worlds: if human identity is tied to the character of inhabited place, then the  forming of one or more virtual identities can serve as an indicator for virtual  placeness of the game world in which I form them. This raises the question of  what deﬁ nes such a character. Based on the player-centered approach in this  argument, it becomes evident that such a character does not depend on prefab- ricated  history  but  on  the  level  of  connectivity  that  a  player  might  develop  toward the virtual over time. The character is not ﬁ lled by the backstory pro- vided by the designer but by the localized actions the player conducts with it.  Chapter 12  192   Eliade mentions “privileged places” like the place of birth, and the place  of one’s ﬁ rst love, that form “holy places” in one’s “private universe”  1987,  24 . Likewise, Bachelard characterizes the house as a “privileged entity” for  the study of “the intimate values of inside space”  1994, 3 . A direct transfer  of these places into game worlds is difﬁ cult. Players are not born in the virtual  space,  nor  will  they  die  there.  Fundamental  spatial  deﬁ nitions  are  ﬂ uid  in  game worlds. Notions of inside outside are less deﬁ ned in virtual worlds where  collision control is an optional feature and the value of walls or other separat- ing demarcations is questionable.  Still, a virtual character’s home inside a multiplayer world, the place of a  signiﬁ cant  gain  or  loss,  of  relevant  encounters  and  revelations,  of  a  ﬁ rst  encounter with an outstanding in-game character—all encourage the assign- ment of some of these personal qualities onto the game space and form the  player’s own identity at the same time.  Techniques  to  establish  this  identity  can  be  seen  as  techniques  to  create  placeness. As Wertheim argues: “Despite its lack of physicality, cyberspace is  a real place. I am there—whatever this statement may ultimately turn out to  mean”  2000, 229; italics in original . If “I am there,” then there has to be a  there, which means that place has to exist in the virtual universe because “I” exist there.  In  return,  the  speciﬁ c  identity  that  “I”  has  attained  in  this  space  is  an  indicator for its placeness. If a player has developed a consistent identity in  the online world of Everquest, then the virtual space of Everquest has become a  “place” for this particular player through the process of identity creation. For  a new player, the consistent massively multiplayer world of Everquest might  be  a  beautiful  playground  to  explore,  a  space  to  master.  For  the  longtime  player, the game world has also become the home for countless social encoun- ters with other players. Complex social structures emerge in the combinations  of online players, adding even more depth to each singular character  T. L.  Taylor 2006 . The individual player can experience the game space as a place  for dwelling rather than merely a territory. That can lead to some confusing  backlashes as seen, for example, in an obviously lighthearted but telling post  on the forums for the massively multiplayer game Horizons: Empire of Istaria  Bowman and Jones 2003 :  A while ago, when ice was down i created a char on Earth, just to look around and have something to do while i waited  .  .  . I never got around to deleting it, now i wonder, what will happen to it once the servers get merged?  .  .  .  what’s the max character limit  shard?  .  .  . will it mess things up?  Maelowyn 2004   Virtual Places  193   Even  if  in  a  comic  way,  the  comment  shows  that  real  and  virtual  player  identities can—at times—swap places. Turkle describes comparable effects in  students, whose identities seem to split into the various windows active on  their desktop, whereby real life  “RL”  is nothing but one option of the self   1996 ; and T. L. Taylor traces criss-crossing ofﬂ ine and online family bands  in the world of Everquest  2006, 55 .  We  cannot  simplify  in  a  formula  that  “more  inhabitants  means  more  place,” but through its variety a vibrant online community provides the pos- sibility for multilayered “social meaning,” which has been identiﬁ ed as a key  element for placeness in multiuser worlds  Harrison and Dourish 1996 . Find- ings that the sheer number of players present through their user-avatars seems  to be a criterion for a vibrant world  Donath 1997; Taylor 2002; Matsuda,  Miyake, and Kawai 2002  support the view that  mediated  human presence  turns mere virtual space into more characterized places. Much has been written  about—and addressed in a far more speciﬁ c way than possible here—the social  communities that evolve from these worlds  see, e.g., Morningstar and Farmer  1991; Dibbell 1999; Schroeder 2002; T. L. Taylor 2006 . The argument, here,  is that these kind of social networks feed back into the virtual locations in  which they are practiced and situated.  The element of place is not limited to multiplayer worlds, either. Single- player  game  worlds  are  also  inhabited  spaces,  concentrated  entirely  on  one  interactor. A player can still create a personal identity in them. Games can  evoke places through narrative elements, which invite players to form a unique  identity and project the necessary meaning into the game space.  Deus Ex is a game played entirely in a ﬁ rst-person point of view with the  player controlling JC Denton, a bioengineered superhuman on the quest to  uncover a worldwide conspiracy. The keys to the ﬁ rst-person presentation are  the numerous cutscenes in which the player and the hero often face snippets  of a larger philosophical discussion. This discussion aims to encourage a player  to deﬁ ne a personal stand toward the game world. At the ending of Deus Ex the player ﬁ nally has to decide the future of this virtual environment. As the  main  antagonist,  a  virtual  AI  character  named  Helios  states:  “We  are  our  choices.” Apart from the obvious philosophical implications, this statement  also refers directly to the gameness of Deus Ex, in which the player gradually  connects to the character and the world. The player’s choices not only shape  JC Denton, as one can choose between numerous nanotechnological “upgrades”  to Denton’s body, but also the whole game world. Morpheus, a separate form  of the main antagonistic Helios AI, clariﬁ es the role of the virtual character  in one of the cutscenes of Deus Ex further:  Chapter 12  194   I’m engineered. So what? My brother and I suspected as much   Morpheus  You  are  a  planned  organism,  the  offspring  of  knowledge  and  imagination rather than of individuals. JC Denton  while we were growing up. Morpheus  You are carefully watched by many people. The unplanned organ- ism  is  a  question  asked  by  nature  and  answered  by  death.  You  are  another  kind of question with another kind of answer. JC Denton  Are you programmed to invent riddles?  Indeed, Morpheus is programmed to invent riddles for the players in order  to bind them to the game universe in which the question is answered through  interaction. These riddles, as seen in the preceding excerpt, can ask the player  about the nature of the main character. They can transcend into questioning  the play space and include references to the relationship of player and avatar  “planned organism.” In both single- and multiplayer environments, the play- er’s experience is a unique one ﬁ lled with personal qualities that get assigned  to the virtual.  Because  video  game  worlds  provide  operational  spaces  that  encourage  players to engage them, ﬁ nd their own identity in relation to them, change and  customize them, and develop a history with them, the question of a player’s  identity in relation to the game world and its placeness are directly intercon- nected. As in the physical realm, the question of place is a question of identity.  And as in the physical world, actions are shaping forces for both of them.  12.2  Shared Actions and Goals  A player’s actions do not necessarily conform to the designer’s intentions for  the game space. In fact, the more complex the game world becomes, the less  a  designer  can  predict  the  unfolding  activity   see,  e.g.,  Morningstar  and  Farmer 1991 . This loss of control does not contradict the process of generat- ing a place. On the contrary, rich game worlds can provide for evolving cul- tural behaviors in order to grow into self-contained virtual places. They do  not depend on carefully prearranged dilemmas like the one in the Morpheus  scene, but on the evolving transgressive or emergent play performed by the  players.  The Dogtown area in West Los Angeles was not intended by its architects  to turn into the Mecca of the skateboarding community. However, it gained  a new cultural signiﬁ cance through this unexpected use. Its spatial structure  was  reclaimed  in  new  ways  by  the  skaters  and  its  function  remodeled.   Virtual Places  195   Streets,  curbs,  benches,  and  handrails  changed  their  functionality,  and  the  skater  introduced  an  unexpected  new  layer  of  meaning  to  the  space  through innovative and unexpected use. Other examples include street running  and  grafﬁ ti.  The  same  can  happen  in  virtual  worlds.  A  virtual  bridge  in  Vana’diel,  the  world  of  the  massively  multiplayer  online  world  of  Final Fantasy XI  Ishii 2002  can turn into a signiﬁ cant spot because players decide  to leave their characters there when inactive. Not intended for that use, the  location  gains  a  new  function,  meaning,  and  value  through  the  player’s  behavior.  In  these  cases,  it  does  not  matter  whether  players  fulﬁ ll  the  designer’s  expectations or behave as a nonconformists; their activity shapes the space in  both  cases.  Player  action  in  game  spaces  infuses  them  with  new  meaning.  Because engagement with space is at the heart of this new use, this meaning  can allow for a higher quality of placeness in these environments. This engage- ment  can  feed  a  player-infused  circle  of  cultural  production  as  Matsuda,  Miyake, and Kawai argue: “User-created culture can become new content in  the  virtual  world  and  also  attract  other  new  users”   2002,  17 .  The  goal  becomes to create a self-sustaining virtual society that is based in the virtual   Figure  12.1 Final  Fantasy  XI;  section  of  the  virtual  city  Jueno  with  player-avatars  inactive   Chapter 12  196   world. The formation of societies and interdependent activities to form larger  cultural scenarios is a core concept of a number of online worlds, including  A Tale in the Desert  Yelon and Tepper 2003  and Second Life.  Another  reﬂ ection  of  that  phenomemon  can  be  found  in  the  way  that  established  cultural  events  transcend  into  online  game  spaces.  For  example,  players  staged  virtual  dance  events  in  parallel  to  the  real-world  Bon dance festival in the PAW^2 project. The event was entirely player-orga- nized  and  coincided  with  the  traditional  Japanese  time  for  that  festival.  Christmas celebrations are staged in World of Warcraft and Easter egg hunts  are held in Everquest. Reports on marriages as well as divorces are legion in  worlds  such  as  Second  Life  or  Ultima  Online.  The  signiﬁ cance  of  the  digital  community  can  become  so  strong  that  real-world  events  are  organized,  such  as  meetings  or  conventions,  where  the  cultural  traditions  established  online can spill into the physical world  e.g., T. L. Taylor 2006 . The shared  practices  of  the  virtual  place  that  shaped  individual  as  well  as  communal  identity  enter  the  physical  world  in  these  real-world  guild  meetings  and  themed conventions.  Player-deﬁ ned actions like these are self-motivated and self-organized, and  thus relate to essential interaction with space as outlined by Norberg-Schulz.  Adapted from Heidegger, Norberg-Schulz’s main relations between inhabited  and uninhabited space can be interpreted as different kinds of interaction of  players relating to the virtual space. They map out the process of turning the  space into a place. These actions signify how players make a virtual space more  precise. They can complement it, so that virtual space might symbolize some cul- tural object. As outlined earlier, we can add creation and destruction of virtual  space to these three.  Building a structure, adding to a landscape or changing it, are dramatic  functions in titles such as SimCity and Age of Mythology as well as in Ultima Online or Second Life. Players make the space more precise for a certain interac- tive situation when they decide what to build and where to build it. This is  the case for successful power management in SimCity as well as for the strategic  preparation  for  an  enemy  onslaught  in  StarCraft.  It  also  indicates  a  way  to  complement the existing space. Players opening a new shop in a certain area  of Second Life or establishing a tavern in Ultima Online imagine the selected  spot to be a good one for the speciﬁ c enterprise. For them it seems to ﬁ ll a  gap in the predesigned game world that needs addressing.  The use of virtual space to symbolize some shared connotation points back  to the plane of the social space and a growing history of a game space. Shared  social  practice—of  multiple  users  as  well  as  single  ones—can  infuse  such  qualities  into  the  game  world.  If  it  becomes  a  shared  practice  to  meet  at  a   Virtual Places  197   certain location in the game world, chances are that somebody will build a  gathering  space  at  this  meeting.  In  that  way,  the  entrance  world  of  Alpha- Worlds grows into the virtual doorway to spaces beyond, or spatial practice  might raise one virtual tavern in Ultima Online to fame while another—with  exactly  the  same  deﬁ ning  variables—remains  insigniﬁ cant.  Bing  Gordon,  chief  creative  ofﬁ cer  at  Electronic  Arts,  argued  at  the  2006  Living  Game  Worlds symposium at Georgia Tech that Ultima Online provides an outdated  game engine, yet “350,000 didn’t want to leave Ultima Online only because  of the houses they owned in there.”  Likewise,  a  location  in  a  single-player  game  can  become  a  valued  place  when it manages to trigger a projection of cultural references into it. These  differ from player to player, but examples might be found again in the game  world of Deus Ex, where the player starts the adventure on Liberty Island in  the pedestal of a ruin of the Statue of Liberty—a spatial representation of a  world in turmoil. An even more critical pointer is found in Liberty City, the  simulated  virtual  city  of  Grand  Theft  Auto  III,  which  does  not  recreate  any  existing real location but references a mixture of urban patterns to create the  “worst place on earth.” Yet one is encouraged to buy virtual real estate in this  world, utilize the restaurants, gyms, clothing shops, hideouts, and numerous  other locations. These connotations are preimplanted by designers but can be  embraced by players as they make these spaces their own. They inhabit and  conquer  the  space  gradually  through  their  personal  actions,  following  their  own goals, forming a place from the provided polygon structures.  12.3  Machinima as Memory  One indicator for this assignment of signiﬁ cance to any space and action are  the memories bound to the place and the event. Reﬂ ections of memory mani- fest in numerous forms: as posts on community message boards; as stories told  on personal websites or ofﬁ cial game publications; as screenshots, comic strips,  or—more recently—as moving images in the form of Machinima.  These formats quote traditional media: short stories, visual art, photogra- phy, and short ﬁ lms, among others, each with their own tradition and struc- ture. At the same time, they offer glimpses into those shared cultural moments  that evolve during play. They are indicators showing how players picked up  certain evocative narrative elements provided by the game world and made  sense  of  them  within  the  game  world.  Machinima  stands  out  among  these  retellings  as  it  uses  the  moving  image  to  present  the  narrative.  Generally,  Machinima  is  described  as  ﬁ lmmaking  with  a  video  game.  The  game  itself  becomes a production studio and the game world a virtual ﬁ lm set.  Chapter 12  198   The  term  “Machinima”  is  a  combination  of  “machine”  and  “cinema.”  Originally suggested as “machinema” by Anthony Bailey in 1998, the term  was accidentally misspelled and wildly publicized as “machinima” by Hugh  Hancock,  head  of  the  Machinima  production  group  Strange  Company  and  editor of the Machinima web portal machinima.com from its launch in 2001  until  2006.  Various  deﬁ nitions  of  Machinima  have  been  introduced  with  slightly different emphases on the main ingredients: real-time virtual worlds,  animation, interaction, and cinematic visualization  see, e.g., Hanson 2004,  60; Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd 2005, 10; Salen 2002, 99; Marino 2004, 3 .  But the format is still ﬂ exible and evolving. As long as no balance between  the different poles is established, it is less helpful to approach Machinima as  a new media format. Instead, it remains a production and playback technique  that can shift between different ﬁ nal states such as theater, animation, game,  and  cinema.  Machinima  can  lead  to  a  range  of  different  results  but  usually  shows some connection to the game world from which it derives.  Because Machinima is generated predominantly from within video game  worlds and is still in most cases produced by players, it provides a good indi- cator for their interpretation of the game world. It is often connected to the  technological as well as the cultural universe of its underlying game engine.  Especially in the form of pure in-game Machinima, which records events as  they unfold during the gameplay, Machinima reﬂ ects the mediated space as  seen by the player and generated by the rule-driven world of the game engine.  This mediated plane is still different from a player’s ﬁ ctional space and the  memories themselves, but it indicates the signiﬁ cance of those in-game ele- ments that were selected for the recording and how a player’s actions relate  to them.  Like most cinematic forms, Machinima is a conscious selection of elements  by  its  producer.  In  that  way,  the  piece  provides  indications  for  a  player’s  perceived meaning of a game space in a certain situation. Not surprisingly,  we see Machinima used to document social events such as online marriages,  protests,  or  art  events  in  virtual  worlds.  For  example,  Natural  Selection  Studios is a Machinima production studio for events in the online world of  Second Life that specialized in personal and business-related videos.  A  Day  at  the  Ironforge  Bank   aka Ironforge  Bankers  [Daddar  2005]   sees  Daddar, a skilled World of Warcraft player with a highly specialized character,  killing  the  guards  of  the  Ironforge  bank,  a  prominent  location  in  the  vir - tual  game  world  of  World  of  Warcraft.  He  recorded  his  actions  via  a  live  screen capture, edited them, added a soundtrack, and released the result as a  Machinima  piece  that  became  immensely  popular  in  the  community.  The  virtual  bank  robbery  has  no  impact  on  the  game  world,  guards  and  bank   Virtual Places  199   accountants  will  respawn,  no  game  quest  can  be  completed,  and  no  virtual  money is gained. It was an entirely player-driven-and-motivated action that  stages the bank as a meaningful target of a heist. Instead of an in-game bonus,  Daddar received a boost in the social metagame and his robbery became leg- endary in the player community.  A Day at the Ironforge Bank is a short video ﬁ lm and not a game. On the  one  hand,  it  features  traditional  cinematic  techniques  that  reference  estab- lished  visual  storytelling  traditions  to  dramatize  the  presentation   Nitsche  2007a . On the other hand, it also exempliﬁ es the signiﬁ cance attributed to  the virtual space. The Ironforge bank is worth looting—even if no in-game  bonus can be gained—because of the cultural signiﬁ cance of the space and its  relevance for the player community. Many other players share the same under- standing of this virtual cultural space. That is why Daddar’s performance was  widely recognized as an amazing stunt—one that inspired players to model  their virtual characters after his. The Machinima stands out as a documenta- tion of his heroic undertaking and helps to imprint it onto a shared memory  that, in turn, can grow those virtual social spaces. As long as the story is told  and remembered, the bank in Ironforge is the one that Daddar attacked. The  functional space of the virtual bank becomes a cultural connotation because a  story  is  associated  with  it.  The  Machinima,  thus,  indicates  a  new  placeness  for this location.  These forms of Machinima are traces of memories of events in the virtual  world formed into traditional storylines. They mirror the growing signiﬁ cance  of games and gaming as cultural practices. Game places grow with the emerg- ing history of the virtual spaces that help to reference and localize the inter- connected memories of a player community.  A number of real-world cultural practices transcended into game worlds  as described earlier. Likewise, Machinima has been used to reenact historical  events  from  the  physical  world.  One  example  is  the  Paul  Smith  Battle   n.n.  2005  that uses the game engine of America’s Army to restage the ﬁ ght that  led to the death and posthumous Medal of Honor awarded to Sgt. Paul R.  Smith. The game engine of Rome: Total War has been used in TV series like  Time  Commanders   BBC Lion  Television  2003   or  Decisive  Battles   History  Channel  2004   to  reenact  historic  battles  and  their  strategies.  At  the  same  time, Machinima can be used for more personal and highly individual memo- ries such as bladeninja’s A Tear Drop  2005 , addressing the suicide of a family  member. Or it can serve political statements as seen in the widely discussed  The French Democracy  Chan 2005 , which provides a perspective on the Paris  riots of 2005 generated entirely in a game engine. Games and game platforms  become expressive vehicles for “real” cultural issues. Finally, Machinima can   Chapter 12  200   mirror the signiﬁ cance of the virtual space as a hybrid of real historic and ﬁ c- tional virtual. When Jim Munroe takes a walk on the streets of Liberty City  in My Trip to Liberty City  Munroe 2003 , he describes his journey as a real- world  experience  of  a  virtual  space.  He  blends  typical  tourist  behavior  and  ﬁ ctional cityscape by taking the game world seriously.  Placeness  is  not  a  quality  of  a  virtual  space  per  se,  but  one  that  can  be  achieved for it through the inhabitants: the game’s players. Virtual placeness  has to be earned. The indicators presented here showed that virtual places can  be traced in the changing character identity, self-motivated goals and actions,  and memory recollection of localized game world events.  A  ﬁ nal  caveat:  not  all  games  depend  or  support  such  a  placeness.  Few  players will experience the labyrinth of Pac-Man as a place with its own genius  loci. The original Pac-Man barely supports any of the aforementioned signs  of place creation. Likewise, players do not have to embrace a new identity in  Tetris but stay “outside” to beat the game they face. It is also difﬁ cult to form  creative  new  goals  in  the  given  universe  because  of  the  relatively  limited  interactive range at hand. Pac-Man features cutscene intermissions, but most  Machinima created from it is repetitive or purely strategic. The single-screen  predeﬁ ned  viewpoint  does  not  allow  for  more  elaborate  camera  work.  The  game  world  remains  spatial  but  lacks  the  quality  of  a  place.  That  does  not  devalue the game, but it does decrease the spatial and place-like signiﬁ cance  that the game world can achieve for the player.  Virtual Places  201    13  Players “in” the Video Game Space  If there is one central question that derives from the creation of virtual places,  then it has to be that of the role of the player in relation to them. The notion  of “identity” was introduced through architectural theory but has been debated  in virtual worlds for some time. Sections 13.1 and 13.2 will look at the player’s  position  in  a  meaningful  game  space.  They  will  consider  the  question  of  presence  in  game  worlds.  What  is  the  player’s  position  in  relation  to  these  environments?  A  core  argument  here  is  that  the  player  is  a  performer  but  can participate in the game world in more than one role. This allows for a  multifaceted exploration of the virtual world and the game’s setting.  13.1  Forms of Presence  Presence, in the context of this investigation, is understood as the mental state  where a user subjectively feels present within a video game space as the result  of an immersion into the content of the ﬁ ctional world  in reference to Slater  1999, 3 . It is a mental phenomenon based on a perceptual illusion.  A number of researchers have concentrated on the idea that a state of pres- ence should be connected to the illusion of a nonmediated experience  Lombard  and  Ditton  1997 .  In  this  case,  players  do  not  see  the  interface  any  more  because they feel present in the world beyond the screen. How this is achieved  and  how  the  effect  might  be  measured  are  somewhat  unclear.  On  the  one  hand, correlation between high presence and physical reaction to the virtual  environment has been proven in experiments. For example, acrophobes might  experience fear of virtual heights  Hodges et al. 1995  or ﬂ ight simulators can  generate a feeling of motion sickness. Psychological therapy has embraced this    new direction, for example in virtual reality exposure therapy that confronts  patients  with  virtual  presentations  of  their  feared  conditions.  In  fact,  every  day  on  the  very  real  commute  to  Georgia  Tech,  I  drive  past  the  Virtually  Better ofﬁ ces in Atlanta that offer virtual therapeutic sessions, for example to  treat the fear of ﬂ ying  Rothbaum et al. 2006 . This particular fear can also  be  addressed  in  real-life  staging  using  a  real  airplane.  The  latter  might  be  more  expensive  but  would  still  provide  the  necessary  conditions.  In  other  cases, certain fear conditions cannot be recreated so easily in reality. In a single  case  study,  Difede  and  Hoffmann   2002   describe  the  successful  use  of  VR  technology to address a post-traumatic stress disorder in a witness and victim  of the September 11 attacks. The VR recreation in this case included different  sequences that depicted fragments of the disaster. They were of varying levels  of  detail  in  their  presentation,  starting  from  a  simple  model  presentation  without  sounds,  then  one  without  explosion,  up  to  a  full  sequence  that  depicted the disaster with all presentational means available.  In order to work, these virtual environments have to evoke some fear in  the user and presence seems to support this effect  Schuemie and Krijn 2005 .  The  effect  of  presence  seems  to  work  but  the  ﬁ ndings  about  how  presence  works are not yet conclusive. Like “interactivity” the term “presence” is central  to virtual environments—but still open for debate. Although there have been  various attempts to measure the level of presence, so far no deﬁ nite way has  been established. Zeltzer introduced the importance of input and output for  the emergence of presence  1992 , but the debate over the concept of measur- ing  presence  as  such  is  still  unresolved   see,  for  example,  the  discrepancies  between Witmer and Singer 1998 and Slater 1999 .  From the vantage point of game spaces, we can argue that the activity and  engagements in all ﬁ ve analytical planes, from rule-based to social, support  presence. More precisely, the interconnections and interdependencies among  them  foster  presence.  To  clarify:  not  every  game  immerses  the  player  in  a  virtual 3D space. Some games reduce their spatiality and players get immersed  not in the game world but in the playing of the game itself. This does not  necessarily affect the level of immersion as the growing references from game  studies to the effects of “ﬂ ow” indicate. Flow has been introduced as a state  in which a person is fully immersed in an action and highly focused to the  extent  that  one  can  experience,  for  example,  a  loss  in  the  feeling  of  self- consciousness  and  time  experience   Csikszentmihalyi  1991 .  A  player  who  reaches this level is clearly immersed in the game but not necessarily “present”  in the virtual space. Flow is action dependent. The player has to concentrate  on a speciﬁ c activity. Presence has been traced to levels of interactivity, but  is less task-oriented and more often discussed in terms of presentation.  Chapter 13  204   Video  game  spaces  cannot  be  dissected  into  either  domain.  A  player  only  perceiving  a  virtual  space  lacks  too  much  of  the  necessary  interactive  engagement  and  hardly  differs  from  a  cinema  audience.  At  the  same  time,  a player only interacting without reading the space is following sheer action- ism  and  limits  the  ﬂ exibility  of  the  event  space.  The  textual  process  of  the game is interrupted or at least complicated. At times, the action becomes  so automatic and part of the player’s memory that spatial references diminish.  During  my  stay  at  Sony  Cambridge,  myths  circulated  of  a  game  tester  who could play a newer version of the classic video game Frogger with his back  to  the  screen  because  he  somehow  memorized  the  pattern  of  the  repetitive  game.  He  had  been  testing  this  title  too  long  and  the  ﬁ xated  world  of  the  frog had left its impact. These are exceptions where players have “grokked”  the  game  until  their  ﬁ ctional  plane  has  reached  the  rule-based  plane.  Most  players do not reach this level and their immersion depends more on the level  of the ﬁ ctional plane.  Both presence and ﬂ ow support each other in video game practice  Takatalo  2002 . The initial focus here will remain on presence but, as will be clear in  the examples below, actions remain important elements in the generation of  this player experience of presence on all levels.  A number of models to discuss presence have been suggested, like the six  conceptualizations  of  presence  as  described  in  Lombard  and  Ditton   1997 ,  and  various  practical  investigations  have  led  to  further  and  more  detailed  models   e.g.,  Takatalo  et  al.  2006 .  For  game  spaces  a  helpful  and  basic  approach can be adopted from Heeter, who distinguishes between three dif- ferent forms of presence in virtual worlds:   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   personal presence  “the extent to which and reasons why you feel like you   are in a virtual world”;  social presence  “the extent to which other beings  living or synthetic  also   exist in the world and appear to react to you”; and  environmental presence  “the extent to which the environment itself appears   to know that you are there and to react to you”  1992, 2 .  How do game worlds evoke these elevated levels of presence on the different  planes outlined by Heeter?  The value of narrative elements for “personal presence” becomes obvious  when comparing the use of interactive computer-aided design walk-throughs  through virtual buildings with 3D video games. In the ﬁ eld of architecture,  the  walk-through  simulations  aim  to  give  the  audience  a  “feel”  for  their  upcoming  home working  space leisure  area,  but  they  rarely  offer  any  active   Players in the Video Game Space  205   engagement  with  the  virtual  world.  These  simulations  provide  a  limited  moment of presence through their low level of functionality. Many architec- tural representations end up as linear movie clips of prerendered camera ﬂ y- throughs through the virtual world and even lack the interactive feature of  navigation or locomotion, which has been identiﬁ ed as one factor to provide  higher levels of presence  Schuemie and Krijn 2005 .  Through their increased graphical sophistication, reliability, and accessibil- ity, game engines have become relevant for architectural design and represen- tation   see,  e.g.,  Richens  and  Trinder  1999;  Shiratuddin  and  Thabet  2002;  Richens  and  Nitsche  2005 ,  as  well  as  for  architectural  reconstructions  of  historic sites  see e.g., Gaitatzes, Christopoulos, and Roussou 2001; Addison  2001; Champion 2003 . Game levels can serve as references to physical struc- tures.  Environments  such  as  the  VRND  Notre-Dame Cathedral  DeLeon  and  Gibbs 1999  using the Unreal engine or München 4D  n.n. 2002  using the  Virtools engine claim to deliver accurate reproductions of their physical refer- ences. However, their interactive access to the virtual surroundings remains  limited to exploration, to a virtual promenade as outlined in section 6.2. These  worlds lack any elaborate functionality but allow the visitor to navigate the  virtual world freely and the architectural walk-through becomes more of each  player’s own exploration. However, except for their footsteps, players barely  touch the surrounding space. They are allowed to look but not to play with  the game space. They remain visitor with little chance to inhabit, occupy, or  affect  the  virtual  space.  All  these  fundamental  techniques  to  increase  the  placeness of a digital world remain unexplored, and the experience turns more  into a visit that is not supposed to leave any imprint. Not surprisingly, this  approach  was  also  used  in  real  estate,  for  example  by  Miliano   1999 ,  who  used the Unreal engine to stage interactive walk-throughs through real prop- erty for sale. You can visit a game space for possible future acquisition of the  real space, but you may not leave any trace in the home you visited.  Neither the visuals nor the sound design are dramatized to the same extent  they  are  in  games  or  ﬁ lms  to  deliver  an  engaging  experience.  Instead,  they  deliver a plain depiction of the virtual structures that aims to somehow simu- late historic or “real” spaces. This reference to the real is a key element of their  value and design. In contrast to this approach, video games can evoke drama  and stimulate the player to have a satisfying experience with little or no refer- ence to real physical buildings. Game worlds such as the ones in Rez, Super Mario 64, or Final Fantasy X have no ambition to depict architecture that can  be reproduced in the real world but to give the player the feeling of personal  presence in the dramatic ﬁ ctional world these games create. They engage the  player in very detailed activities with all kinds of elements in the game world,   Chapter 13  206   increase  their  access  over  time  and  thus  encourage  further  interaction,  and  constantly reward the player. They engage the player with the virtual world  instead of hoping to achieve this effect later through physical implementation  of the structures presented.  Referring back to the experiment with acrophobes and virtual reality expo- sure therapy, it becomes clear that a situation has to be dramatized in order  to improve its impact. When testing a virtual environment’s efﬁ ciency with  the  acrophobes,  the  speciﬁ c  dramatic  involvement   the  growing  fear  with  growing height  was provided by the special condition of the group of par- ticipants  all acrophobic or with acrophobic tendencies   Hodges et al. 1995 .  To  evoke  a  comparably  dramatic  effect  of  threatening  height  in  a  group  of  non-acrophobes, one has to dramatize the situation and the role of the player  within it through special functionality and presentation. In order to provide  the acrophobic effect to non-acrophobes, Hitchcock used complex sound and  camera  work  in  Vertigo  1958   that  consisted  of  a  careful  combination  of  camera movement and zooms to create a feeling of vertigo through the distor- tion of the space represented. Likewise, game worlds have to apply effective  presentation to provide for comparably effective dramatization, and a number  of possible approaches have been outlined in part II, especially in chapter 7.  At the same time, the game worlds have to incorporate interactive access. It  is not enough to experience the vertigo effect visually; the player wants to be  able to dive into the space and engage with it. So, as outlined, the relationship  has to be an active one to improve presence. Superman Returns  Peters 2006   allows players to rush through the virtual Metropolis. This rush is dramatized  by additional visual stimuli as the picture references the visual phenomenon  of tunnel vision to emphasize the speed effect. These elements support immer- sion, but are based on spatial design, reading, and practice trancending various  analytical planes. Rushing through the virtual Metropolis is only one way to  increase the player’s engagement with the world. All other elements of func- tionality and presentation have to connect to improve players’ immersion. In  combination they provide for higher personal presence that activates and con- nects the ﬁ ve analytical planes of game space. It is in this combination that  game spaces increase the level of presence in the environment.  “Social  presence”  can  be  best  traced  in  multiuser  worlds.  In  these  game  environments players constantly share locations with each other. The feeling  of  “copresence,  a  sense  of  ‘being  there  together’ ”   Schroeder  2002,  4   can  support their immersion. Notes T. L. Taylor, “In multi-user worlds, the power  of embodied presence is also quite often directly tied to a practice of presence  as  a  social  activity.  In  this  formulation,  the  inscription  of  self  on  the  space  becomes a socially mediated experience. Through action, communication, and   Players in the Video Game Space  207   being in relation to others, users come to ﬁ nd themselves ‘there’. It is through  placing  one’s  avatar  in  the  social  setting,  having  a  self  mirrored,  as  well  as  mirroring back, that one’s presence becomes grounded”  2002, 44 .  One creates the avatar and the avatar’s persona not only for the other players  but also for oneself  see also Stone 1998; McMahan 2003 . Games allow for  “countless ways of shape-shifting”  Murray 1997, 154 , which introduce Mur- ray’s  key  pleasure  of  transformation  to  game  worlds.  Questions  of  role  and  identity overlap as players transform themselves through this projection onto  a virtual character.  In single-player environments non-player characters can feed this projec- tion  by  addressing  the  player  directly  as  the  ﬁ ctional  character,  as  seen  in  Half-Life 2. The player enters a role in relation to other beings in the game  space and is immersed further through the development of this role and his  or  her  embracing  of  these  developments.  Evocative  narrative  elements  to  support the characters also strengthen a form of social presence in single-player  titles. These means can include forms of interaction  such as co-op play, or  player vs. player play, or methods of player communication  as well as spatial  design  such as public vs. private spaces  to support the social plane and to  increase social presence in game titles.  “Environmental presence” can be traced in the reactions of a virtual space  to a user’s interactions. This is part of the interface abstraction in game spaces  and includes architectural elements like opening doors or windows that seem  to  react  to  the  player  in  the  world.  Other  examples  include  a  trace  of  the  user-avatar’s virtual footsteps or the shadow the user-avatar casts in the ﬁ c- tional world. Again, the connection of presentation and interaction is the most  interesting one in these examples. Champion, for example, argues for a “virtual  heritage” that consists of a change in the place in relation to user activities   2003 . Here, the interactor literally leaves some form of trace in the environ- ment, which is used by Champion to enhance navigation. Any such trace is  an example of environmental presence and provides for a contextualization of  virtual space. The strategy game Myth: The Fallen Lords  J. Jones 1997  uses  a gradually changing ground texture onto which players literally inscribe their  paths.  The  playground  ﬁ lls  up  with  signs  of  maneuvers  and  bloodstains  of  past battles over the course of a game round.  Inscribing one’s action into the game space visually emphasizes the con- nection between the game world and the inhabitants. While Myth: The Fallen  Lords  automatically  adjusts  the  space  and  adds  the  tracks  and  traces  in  the  game world, other titles make these inscriptions part of the conscious game- play mechanics. Counter-Strike offers the option to spray a virtual grafﬁ ti on  the game walls to leave a personalized image in the space. The option became   Chapter 13  208   a form of self-expression in the game world embraced by artists and activists  such as Anne-Marie Schleiner. Her Velvet-Strike project  Schleiner 2002  pro- vided  players  with  certain  kinds  of  prefabricated  grafﬁ ti  tags  that  can  be  spread in the Counter-Strike world but that are inspired by Schleiner’s antiwar  position.  The  game  space  turns  into  a  canvas  for  the  self-expression  of  the  player-artist.  On the level of personal, social, and environmental presence, space and its  presentation  ultimately  situate  interactors  into  special  contexts.  Players  are  positioned as Heeter’s model is realized on all levels. What, then, is the result- ing player positioning in relation to the ﬁ ctional world?  13.2  Player Positioning  It is not only the space that has to adjust to support player engagement. The  player changes, too. Poole claims that: “In the cinema, the world is projected  at you; in a videogame, you are projected into the world”  2000, 98; italics in  original .  But  this  direct  projection  lacks  awareness  of  the  player’s  “transforma- tion”—one’s  dramatic  positioning  in  relation  to  the  world.  “You”  are  not  directly projected into the ﬁ ctional world of a video game space. Instead, you  get access to distinct elements  e.g., an avatar  within it and from that a feeling  of presence can emerge. This chapter will look into this access through posi- tioning, not only on the level of the mediated plane but also for the rule-based, ﬁ ctional, and social ones.  13.2.1  No Role  There are forms that seemingly let the player participate in the game as “you”  as they hide the fourth wall of classic theatrical productions and immerse the  player in the game world. In Alternate Reality Games  ARG , players follow  hidden clues through a complex network knitted from any available data from  webpages, telephone calls, Global Positioning System, ﬁ lm trailers, and other  media sources.  Under the credo “This Is Not a Game,” ARGs blend the players’ play space  with the rule-based and ﬁ ctional spaces. In games such as The Beast  Lee 2001 ,  players ﬁ nd themselves searching for ﬁ ctional clues in real as well as virtual  locations, from public bathrooms in Chicago to an extensive network of fab- ricated websites. The Beast originated as a publicity game for the release of  Spielberg’s A.I. Artiﬁ cial Intelligence  2001  and consisted of a complex network  of  puzzles  and  relations,  mysteries,  and  ﬁ ctional  institutions  created  by  the  game designers—called puppet masters. To solve the intricate puzzles, players   Players in the Video Game Space  209   had to collaborate in large groups, forming a highly efﬁ cient social space. They  hacked into websites and collected and combined fragments of information  to solve the set mystery.  The blurring of the “real” with the “game” results in a shift of perception  when individuals get so involved in the game that any distinguishing between  game and nongame becomes difﬁ cult. Some players of The Beast blurred the  demarcation  line  of  the  “magic  circle”  that  describes  the  play  space.  They  discussed the application of their grown framework for real-life problems such  as solving the mystery of the September 11 attacks or U.S. government issues   McGonigal 2003b . In these cases, the layer of the social space has built up  its  own  rules  and  systems.  They  become  so  dominant  and  vivid  that  these  player-driven networks seem to look for new play spaces to reapply their rule  systems.  A  rule-based  plane  seems  to  invade  and  overlay  one’s  everyday  real  world and the deﬁ nition of the play space becomes difﬁ cult as the dividing  fourth  wall  disintegrates.  Alternate  Reality  Games  form  pervasive  gaming  worlds in which players do not have to identify with a ﬁ ctional actor, but can  act as themselves in ﬁ ctional settings. McGonigal  2003a  argues that players  are capable of clearly identifying which action belongs to which realm, and  that  their  immersion  grows  from  a  directed  longing  to  believe,  which  is  a  conscious effort and would provide a clear distinction She might be right, and  the  game  events  and  spaces  in  Alternate  Reality  Gaming  might  be  more  clearly deﬁ ned than its own “This Is Not A Game” credo suggests. However,  any  repositioning  of  the  player  as  actor  without  restricting  the  new  role  is  blurring the borderlines in the player’s performance. The playground might  be marked  more or less clearly , but the role remains without such a demarca- tion line. ARGs are not following the same limitations of role-playing games  but  have  elements  of  hidden  theater  where  everyday  life  and  performance  blend.  According to Elan Lee, ARG designer, “If you look at a typical video game,  it’s really about turning you into a hero; a super hero, a secret agent. It’s your  ability to step outside your life and be someone else. An ARG [= Alternate  Reality Game] takes those same sensibilities and applies them to your actual  life. It says, what if you actually were a super hero, what if you actually were  a  secret  agent?  Instead  of  living  in  the  box  that’s  your  television  or  your  computer, why not use your actual life as a storytelling delivery platform?”   see Ruberg 2006 .  As much as “This Is Not A Game” is a tongue-in-cheek battle cry of ARG  designers, it still highlights the diffusion of what is game and what is not,  when a person is playing and when not.  Chapter 13  210   Another special case is the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment  CAVE .  CAVEs consist of a closed box in which the interactor stands, surrounded by  rear-projected stereoscopic images that create the illusion of a seamless virtual  space. The body is enclosed in space “in front” of screens. In fact, one does  not see any space except the virtual playground and one’s own physical self.  In  the  CAVE  at  Duke  University  I  found  myself  playing  a  new  version  of  Pong—not the original tabletop arcade machine, or the home console version  using the television as projection screen. In this fully immersive 3D Pong I  stood  in  the  middle  of  a  cross-shaped  platform  ﬂ oating  in  space,  holding  a  virtual wire-frame paddle attached to the controller in my hand. With this  virtual paddle I hit back balls rolling toward me from all four sides. The setup  brought back fond memories of the grid in Tron. Like Kevin Flynn  played  by Jeff Bridges  who stepped onto the grid of his own program in Lisberger’s  Tron, I  playing myself  stepped into the grid of the Pong world. No avatar is  needed—no  body  but  mine.  But  unlike  the  Alternate  Reality  Games,  the  CAVE has demarcation lines through its mediated nature. I can bump against  the projection walls. When I started jumping, a scared operator rushed in to  say that they were not so sure about the weight that the ﬂ oor projection plane  could carry. Too much body at the wrong spot and I might fall through the  mediating plane into the projection room below. The CAVE cubicle is a spa- tially deﬁ ned virtual stage for one performer. When I left the cubicle I left  Pong behind with it. This is not necessarily the case in ARGs where the whole  world can become a playground because the media applied are unrestricted  and my role is not deﬁ ned.  This is rarely the case in the video game spaces that form the core discussed  here. Players navigate them usually through some form of virtual representa- tion,  for  example  an  avatar.  They  always  generate  a  certain  relation  to  the  world through the mediating plane, for example, as generals looking down  onto the virtual battleground. This provides a structured point of access for  participation  in  a  video  game.  Users  can  feel  present  in  the  ﬁ ctional  world  through such dramatic positioning, but they are not embodied in this world  themselves. They cannot crash through the projection plane nor do they dis- solve the mediating demarcation line of the computer as media. What, then,  is the user positioning in a video game space?  13.2.2  Actors of One Role  Due  to  the  given  technical  limitations,  early  analyses  of  player  positioning  mostly related to text performances, such as text chat  Wunderer 1999; Reid  1991  or MUD titles  Laurel 1993 . Often these works envision future spatial  possibilities from the limited text-centric pieces at hand. Murray  1997 , for   Players in the Video Game Space  211   example, addresses the break through the fourth wall practically by referring  to MUDs, among other technology, and develops it with reference to highly   hyper mediated future VR worlds such as the model of the Holodeck as intro- duced in the TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation. The Holodeck is a kind  of science-ﬁ ction CAVE that strips out the boundaries of the mediating projec- tion planes. Thanks to some future technology, the space extends indeﬁ nitely.  Neither can I break through the ground projection plane, nor bump into the  siding projection walls. This form has not yet materialized. What emerged  instead is a widespread 3D spatiality of video games that is not experienced as  a Holodeck vision but as a world of polygons presented via a mediated plane.  This world is limited in its appearance and functionality and those factors shape  the player’s positioning.  The functionality of interactive digital media positions the player as a cre- ative  performing  element  inside  the  spatially  located  discourse.  But  this  transformation  is  still  deﬁ ned  by  the  mediating  plane  that  allows  it.  The  presentation through cinematic means allows the user to step into the spatial  world of the action itself through the ﬁ ltering eyes of the virtual camera. In  doing so, interactors adapt to the dramatic positioning and step into a dra- matic role in relation to the game space.  Black and White  Molyneux et al. 2001  translates concepts of sacred virtual  spaces into a 3D video game world to support the player’s dramatic role. In  the world of Black and White, the user is positioned as an invisible god-creature  worshipped by the virtual beings living on various islands spread in a seem- ingly endless ocean. Norberg-Schulz emphasizes the position of a real island  as  “a  place  par  excellence,  appearing  as  an  ‘isolated’,  clearly  deﬁ ned  ﬁ gure”   1980, 39 . Black and White embraces this idea of isolated land formations.  Spatially, these virtual islands are conceptual counterparts to the amorphous  play space of Alternate Reality Games. On these islands, pillars of light indi- cate points of special interest.  Visually, these lights relate to Ching’s principles of axis and hierarchy. In  the setting of the game they represent a virtual axis mundi—the vertical con- nection between heaven and earth in the ﬁ ctional world  see, e.g., Eliade 1987,  33–36 . Consequently they support the player positioning as “god” as they  reach  up  toward  the  heavens  where  the  camera  has  positioned  the  player.  Starting from its introductory cutscene, Black and White establishes a hierar- chical relationship between the virtual god  the player, hovering high above  the game world  and commoners  AI-driven virtual inhabitants of the world  below . The light axes between them connect both in a symbolic and visual  way that supports a stronger player positioning in this one role.  Chapter 13  212   Figure 13.1 Black and White: lights assisting orientation and positioning.  But their value goes beyond a simple visual reinforcement of the player’s  positioning. Eliade offers the notion of a meaningful position—a mark—set  by its sacred meaning: “The manifestation of the sacred ontologically founds  the world. In the homogenous and inﬁ nite expanse, in which no point of refer- ence  is  possible  and  hence  no  orientation can  be  established,  the  hierophany  reveals an absolute ﬁ xed point, a center”  ibid., 21; italics in original . Tech- niques of orientation, therefore, Eliade sees as “techniques for the construction of sacred space”  ibid., 29; italics in original . The pillars of light in Black and  White play with this notion. One way to create more light beams is for the  virtual inhabitants of each island worlds to build temples for their gods  the  player . These temples generate strong light beams that offer clear points of  orientation. The better the player manages the game space and its inhabitants,  the  more  followers  the  player  has,  the  more  temples  will  be  built,  and  the  easier  it  becomes  to  navigate.  Eliade  argues  that  these  structures  assist  the  orientation of the commoner—he is the one who generates such a landmark  to establish the relation to the world. In Black and White the roles are reversed,  as the player-gods need guidance through the digital world. It might be the   Players in the Video Game Space  213   tasks of peasants and followers to build the temples, but it is the player-god  who gains from the improved orientation.  In  addition,  smaller  lights  indicate  unresolved  tasks  or  reward  options.  These light beams not only provide help for spatial orientation, but they also  indicate past and future activities. Because they offer entry points to subquests  and reward points for successful interaction, they inscribe traces of a history  onto the ﬁ ctional world of Black and White. The resulting network contributes  to the narrative and dramatic setting as well as the different layers of presence  as outlined in the last chapter. It weaves the player into the position of the  “god” applying any means available.  Being a god is a valid and widespread player role, but it certainly is only  one  among  many  possible  forms  of  player  positioning.  During  a  panel  at  a  ﬁ lm festival in New York I was seated on a stage next to other panelists on  one side and a live rendered “Master Chief” on the other. The Master Chief is  the virtual hero from the very successful video game series Halo and millions  of  players  have  slipped  into  this  role  while  playing  the  ﬁ rst-person  shooter  game. In this case, the Master Chief was not here to ﬁ ght but to talk. The  character was the virtual alter ego of Chris Burke of the Machinima talk show  This  Spartan  Life.  Burke  himself  operated  him  live  from  a  desk  offstage.  Instead of feeling out of place or between two worlds, the whole setup was  quickly accepted by the panelists and the audience. It felt rather normal to  be surrounded by natural and virtual panelists. In fact, it was more confusing  to see the real Chris Burke hiding behind the curtain with his Xbox controller  and voice headset and navigating the Halo commander.  Like me, most of the people in the audience had either seen or controlled  the Master Chief themselves. We had already some form of personal relation- ship with him. He had already been our representation in the virtual world  before. Because he had been our role, we had no problems in addressing him  as a valid face of the hidden Burke. He ﬁ t right in on a panel ﬁ lled with other  participants from very real institutions such as MIT, Georgia Tech, and MTV.  With  growing  literacy  our  reservations  against  virtual  characters  fade.  We  took this virtual character seriously when he provided expert opinion on video  game cultures.  Chris  Burke  played  the  Master  Chief  on  an  Xbox  console  taking  on  the  character, his perspective, and range of action. This fulﬁ lls claims of cyber- space researchers as stated in the early work of Laurel: any user should play a  single  virtual  role.  She  originally  compared  a  player  to  an  actor  playing  a  dedicated role on the virtual stage. This should be experienced in a ﬁ rst-person  visualization  Laurel 1986 —a dictum followed by many VR research proj- ects. Other projects offer variations of this basic demand. The Acting in VR   Chapter 13  214   project at University College London offered virtual rehearsals in a ﬁ rst-person  point of view  Slater et al. 2000 . These virtual performances were intended  to prepare actors for later performances in the real world. The project addressed  problems of acting in such an environment, including the necessary interface  that  needed  constant  improvements  throughout  the  project   ibid.,  7 .  The  virtual actors in that project had to be able to express emotion through body  language  and  facial  expressions.  This  is  no  easy  feat.  Avoiding  most  of  the  connected  questions  about  facial  animation  and  subtle  body  control,  Halo’s Master Chief, for example, hides his face behind a reﬂ ecting helmet and his  body behind clunky full-body armor. However limited these expressions were,  the concept itself seemed to be useful. Engaging the user as actor of one role  in the events on the virtual stage is, indeed, a possible dramatic positioning.  Countless games such as Halo or Half-Life have exempliﬁ ed that. Countless  others—like the Max Payne, the Tomb Raider, the God of War, or the Prince of  Persia series—have shown that the camera does not have to be in a ﬁ rst-person  point of view to connect the player to a single virtual role. Playing a game in  one role is a valid approach and strong evocative narrative statement, but a  single role is not an inherently necessary restriction posed by virtual environ- ments, as one might assume from Laurel.  It  takes  a  trained  actor  a  long  time  to  understand  and  act  out  a  certain  character, usually under the guidance of experienced directors. The Acting in  VR project  had  a  director  speciﬁ cally  included  in  the  team  to  support  this  process. The merit of Machinima performers like the ILL Clan or Burke rests  within their abilities to deliver engaging improvised performances in virtual  spaces. Their success grows from their expertise as virtual performers. Many  virtual performers, like the members of the ILL Clan, have a background in  theater and have developed their technique over the years. It is not only the  mastering of the game space and the interface that makes them stand out as  actors,  it  is  also  their  basic  understanding  of  acting  as  such,  their  sense  of  timing, ﬂ uent teamwork, and understanding of drama.Like traditional impro- visational  players,  they  are  capable  of  switching  roles  and  playing  multiple  characters. They step behind the idea of the “single role.” As in the world of  real theater it can take a virtual performer a lot of time and practice to develop  the necessary expertise.  Game players rarely want to wait this long in order to use game spaces.  However, game players usually have neither a ﬁ xed script before entering a  scene,  nor  a  guiding  director.  It  is  the  system  that  provides  guidance  and  dramatic role through the interface. For example, the system can offer a choice  of  stock  characters  to  the  interactor  as  seen  in  the  Tekken  series  on  virtual  martial arts. Once the choice is made, the interactor is conﬁ ned to the chosen   Players in the Video Game Space  215   user-avatar’s  limitations  and  abilities  and  its  restrictions  shape  the  player’s  access to the virtual world and the evolving discourse. Certain ﬁ ghters have  certain moves and abilities, and it is up to the player to discover and master  them in the Tekken series. It is, however, up to the designer to make sure that  all the different ﬁ ghters remain balanced against one another in their abilities.  Even  if  all  characters  are  fundamentally  based  on  the  same  model—as  seen  in Counter-Strike—it  remains  the  designer’s  tasks  to  balance  and  restrict  their roles.  If one selects the role of a counter-terrorist in the game Counter-Strike, one  has to accept the associated demands of this positioning  diffuse bombs, free  hostages, defeat terrorists . This shifts the player into a set position in relation  to the game space and its ingredients. The shift can be abrupt—as in Tekken or Counter-Strike—or gradual. In the single-player campaign of Halo the player  is  gradually  immersed  into  the  game  world.  In  the  ﬁ rst  mission,  the  main  character lacks any weapon and is guided by a non-player character through  the environment until an enemy attack starts and the player has to show that  she  has  learned  the  ﬁ rst  steps  of  controlling  Master  Chief  by  surviving  the  ﬁ rst crisis. Learning basic spatial navigation is the ﬁ rst task in this step-by- step  shift  into  the  virtual  role,  not  ﬁ ghting  or  control  of  in-game  vehicles.  Spatial experience and mastering and role creation and acceptance seem to be  closely interrelated. The same rings true for Half-Life.  We wanted to make sure that Gordon [= Gordon Freeman, virtual hero in Half-Life] was a product of his environment and also had an interesting role there that tied into  the game play in some way.  .  .  .  Gordon is supposed to be a bright young physicist,  and the characters assume he is well trained for his tasks; yet the player really doesn’t  have  a  clue  what  to  do,  and  the  things  they  actually  spend  doing  often  amount  to  menial tasks.  .  .  .  The most important thing was to give the player a feeling of being  constantly off balance, never quite sure of what was expected of them, to give them  the  task  of  continually  ﬁ nding  this  out  for  themselves.   Marc  Laidlaw;  see  Isbister  2006, 220   The virtual role of Gordon Freeman is set in a cultural context: he is intro- duced as a bright physicist and MIT graduate. These role elements are con- stantly enhanced as the player ﬁ nds herself “off balance” and has to readjust  to  the  provided  role.  To  engage  the  player,  the  game  does  not  ask  him  to  develop  a  new  character—as  the  Acting  in  VR  project  did—but  to  accept  a  very  speciﬁ c  role  with  all  its  limitations.  Theatrical  actors  concentrate  and  develop  their  wide  range  of  expressive  vocabulary  in  order  to  give  life  to  a  ﬁ ctional character presented to a paying audience. In contrast, most character  options in games work the other way around. They are extreme concentrations   Chapter 13  216   predeﬁ ned by a designer and an integral part of the ﬁ ctional world. They are  the interactive options delivered by the system and accepted by the user who  can  experience  this  pleasure  of  “transformation”   Murray  1997 .  Interactors  are often allowed to change and customize their character, but principally have  to adapt to the limited character options and interactive access offered by the  system. These characters often feature few expressions beyond the necessary  functions to play the game. They are not equipped for other performances and  expression than the one they are optimized for, which complicates the devel- opment of new narratives  see also Perlin 2004 .  Learning  the  rules  of  a  game  space  to  fulﬁ ll  the  demands  of  the  game  mirrors to some extent the rehearsal process of theater productions. An actor  is learning the best possible performance during the rehearsal of a scene—an  interactor is learning the best possible  or at least sufﬁ ciently effective  per- formance of a task in a game space. Both do so by repeating it over and over  again. While the space of the ﬁ lm set in most narrative ﬁ lms is arranged to  support the performance of the actor, the space of the game is shaped to guide  the player’s limitations. It can be a friction zone for the character and localize  its development. Mastering it is often the ﬁ rst challenge. When I enter the  main laboratory in the heart of Half-Life’s Black Mesa complex, I am staged  in  the  role  of  the  research  assistant  Gordon  Freeman.  I  have  to  conduct  an  experiment by pushing an unknown artifact into a central chamber. From a  certain moment on, the space does not allow any other meaningful action than  that. Even the path along which I have to push the cart with the material is  clearly deﬁ ned. Through my successful performance in the given limitations,  I acknowledge and accept the proposed role in the game.  A  comparable  effect  is  at  work  when  players  learn  play  strategies  to  optimize  their  use  of  the  game  space  in  multiplayer  game  sessions.  This  kind of performance has aspects of a sport as well as of performance  Lowood  2005 .  Success  here  is  the  total  and  elegant  defeat  of  the  opponent.  The  more effective and unique a player’s strategy, the more it might be admired,  but the task itself does not depend on an expression to be optimized but a  strategy  to  be  deployed.  The  character  becomes  a  game  token  in  this  strategy.  Players  learn  the  necessary  jump  length  in  Super  Mario  64,  the  weapon  performance in Quake II, or the ﬁ ghting combos in Tekken. Such a task-driven  approach does not attempt to express the emotional depth, inner struggle, or  feelings of the character. Instead, this kind of problem solving often stays on  the  level  of  an  athlete,  a  stuntman,  or  a  chess  ﬁ gurine.  These  user-avatars  perform  tasks—they  are  not  optimized  to  act  out  complex  expressions  and  interactors  cannot  develop  multifaceted  characters  as  long  as  they  lack  the   Players in the Video Game Space  217   necessary acting skills and the expressive vocabulary. Within these roles we  can often trace cultural frames.  Half-Life’s Gordon Freeman and Halo’s Master Chief are the independent,  individualistic,  and  often  lonely  heroes  that  gain  admiration  by  constantly  proving their superiority. Isbister has traced this character back to the Ameri- can  tradition  of  John  Wayne  and  Clint  Eastwood  characters.  She  contrasts  them with the group-oriented, supporting, and differently depicted characters  of Final Fantasy X that mirror traits of Japanese culture  Isbister 2006, 55 .  The  interconnected  character  networks  in  role-playing  games  foreshadow  the  next  section:  how  a  player  deals  with  more  than  one  role  in  a  given  game world.  Indeed, Isbister’s argument in character differences is shining through in  their use of game spaces. The lone hero in the mentioned examples explores  and conquers the technology-driven, hostile, often closed spaces of Half-Life and Halo. The group-oriented characters of Final Fantasy X wander through  more  mystic,  slower-paced,  colorful  exterior  landscapes.  The  differences  are  also present in the form of presentation: the complete dependency of the ﬁ rst- person shooter on perspective contrasts with RPGs relatively late move into  full 3D. In these differences we can mirror Isbister’s argument for different  culturally grounded characters in the design of the game spaces and the spatial  representation, but it is difﬁ cult to derive archetypical or visual standards from  that without extreme simpliﬁ cation. For example, it was the Japanese game  Super Mario 64 that took the 2D game genre of jump and run and adjusted  it  to  3D  game  spaces,  proving  a  possible  2D  preferences  of  Japanese  game  culture dubious. Other practices show that even streamlined characters like  the action hero Master Chief can become stars of long-running narratives.  The Machinima group Rooster Teeth performed all one hundred episodes  of their immensely successful video show Red vs. Blue in the game environment  of Halo.  One  of  their  main  appeals  grows  from  the  fact  that  they  project  complex personalities in different Master Chief-like warriors, although these  characters  all  look  very  alike  with  only  differing  color  schemes.  All  Master  Chiefs originally have the same roles, the same status, the same abilities, and  the same mission in this online game. As they question all of this uniformity  it is only ﬁ tting for Rooster Teeth to start the ﬁ rst episode with a question:  “Why are we here?” Rooster Teeth questions the restricted spatial setting of  the multiplayer Halo world that the avatars inhabit—as well as one’s role in  that world. The characters are trapped in their assigned roles and inside the  simpliﬁ ed ﬁ ghting arena to perform these roles, the multiplayer game of the  Blood  Gulch  Canyon,  but  Rooster  Teeth  looks  beyond  those  limitations.  A  mayor appeal of this very successful Machinima series is the fact that they are   Chapter 13  218   struggling  with  questions  that  reach  beyond  this  space  and  the  given  role  within. “Why are we here?” is one part of the question “Who are we?” and  reframes the whole game setting. Over the course of the show, Red vs. Blue develops its characters and their relation to a soap-opera-like network.  But  given  conceptual  limitations  can  make  it  difﬁ cult  to  develop  deep  characters  from  games.  Interesting  hybrids  emerge  when  this  vocabulary  is  enriched, which brings us back to the role-playing genre. Most online titles  allow  for  avatar  customization  and  player-player  communication  that  add  individual touches to a character. An expert role-player in a multiuser world  can invest a lot of personal efforts in the development of a coherent character,  whose  visual  expressions  remain  restricted  but  are  matched  by  a  complex  behavior  and  a  growing  character’s  history.  In  that  way,  role-players  can  develop  their  expressive  repertoire  through  extensive  playing  during  which  they enact the chosen role much like in an ongoing improvisational theater  scene. Over time, many of the developed characters gain personal and shared  histories.  “Avatar bodies don’t exist in isolation. They exist in context”  T. L. Taylor  2002, 44  and this context is codeﬁ ned by the spatial conditions of the per- sistent game space. Enriching this context through a long-lasting consistent  behavior  can  lead  to  the  creation  of  a  meaningful  ﬁ ctional  character  even  though  the  expressive  means  of  this  character  are  still  very  limited.  As  the  social  plane  sinks  into  the  game  space,  placeness  emerges  from  the  virtual  environment and changes the quality of the virtual world. The possible han- dling  of  that  role  reaches  into  the  debate  on  gender  roles  in  virtual  worlds   Reid 1996; Stone 1996; Hayles 1996; Morse 1996; Herz 1997; Isbister 2006   and touches on wider social implications in the context of virtual communities   Rheingold 1991; Turkle 1996; Dibbell 1999; T. L. Taylor 2006 . All of these  effects  affect  the  player’s  role  in  the  game  space  and  with  it  their  spatial  conditioning.  However, the quality of “acting” and successful character creation is debated  even  among  role  players.  Koster,  designer  of  the  multiuser  online  worlds  Ultima Online and Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, posted his “Koster’s  law” as follows: “The quality of roleplaying is inversely proportional to the  number of people playing”  1999 . His “law” implies that the larger a role- playing community becomes, the lower the quality of role playing overall. The  consistency of the shared game space and the roles in it become ambiguous as  the game cannot make sure that every player stays “in character” in relation to  the game space due to the sheer size of the player community. Instead of con- centration on the single role and its expression, a different term might offer  help to describe the player’s role in this moment: the participant.  Players in the Video Game Space  219   Players as participants shape the discourse but not necessarily as “actors”  who aim to express a believable dramatic role in a performance. Like readers  of a book and viewers of a ﬁ lm, participants in games are capable of changing  their position. They might identify with one virtual character for some time,  but are not conﬁ ned to a single perspective and can spread their persona over  a number of characters. They participate in the game space, its setting, and  action, but remain ﬂ exible in the question of the role and perspective in it. A  player of the real-time strategy game StarCraft is free to play one of three races  in an interstellar conﬂ ict. The single-player campaign takes players through  all three of them, interconnecting them effectively to one whole saga enacted  by the player. One participates in the conﬂ ict from multiple positions roles  and understands the spatiotemporal conditions of the game world as well as  the logic behind each of the opposing factions much better. Here, players are  not  grounded  in  any  single  role  but  still  achieve  a  better  understanding.  StarCraft is a real-time strategy title with very limited character development.  The  effect  can  be  even  more  dramatic  when  the  character  aspects  are  more  important,  as  seen,  for  example,  in  the  title  Indigo  Prophecy   aka  Fahrenheit   Cage 2005 . In Indigo Prophecy, the player switches between different charac- ters facing a conspiracy and each one holds different parts of the key to the  ﬁ nal  question.  Players  engage  with  the  game  world  as  detective  as  well  as  murderer, among other roles.  13.2.3  Active Participants in Multiple Roles  The variable narrative positioning of readers of books or audiences of ﬁ lms is  a valuable element of these media’s narrative capabilities  for a discussion of  perspective in ﬁ lm, see, e.g., Bordwell 1985; Wilson 1988, and for a discus- sion of narrative perspective in literature see, e.g., Genette 1980; Bal 1985;  Herman 2002 . Likewise, players of video games can use virtual characters as  different windows to the game world. Each character can offer a speciﬁ c per- spective through special restrictions in functionality and forms of presenta- tion.  Each  character  can  enact  and  interpret  a  certain  action  differently.  Shifting the audience’s perspective toward the action offers itself as a higher  form of evocative narrative element. A new role changes a player’s expectations  of the game space; it offers new interactive options and shines a different light  on the past ones. This widens the player’s comprehension of the game world  and adds more layers to it. That is why these paragraphs argue for players as  active participants in multiple roles to increase each player’s possible engage- ment in the game world. This does not imply an abolition of the idea of role  as such—on the contrary. The argument continues for the need of a role as   Chapter 13  220   such  on  a  game  world  stage  to  position  the  player,  but  the  role  becomes  a  variable.  A  variable  player  positioning  implies  ﬂ exibility  and  occasional  distance  from characters. Players have to detach themselves from one virtual persona,  to  leave  one  character  behind  and  concentrate  on  another.  Does  this  break  engagement and propel the player outside the game world? One game series  that uses a distance between player and virtual character is The Sims series. In  The Sims, players are not staged as heroes in an adventure that addresses them  but as controllers of an ongoing simulation between different characters that  seem  to  live  their  life  in  a  virtual  suburbia.  The  positioning  differs  clearly  from an Aristotelian idea of immediate engagement. Frasca relates this dis- tance between the virtual character and the user to the theatrical principles  of  Augusto  Boal   Frasca  2001 .  In  The  Sims,  Frasca  sees  the  user  in  a  ﬁ xed  position: as controller, who plays with characters like substances to be com- bined in an experiment based on the simulation settings in “non-immersive  videogame playing”  ibid, 4 . This decisively non-Aristotelian approach, he  argues,  allows  for  a  different  perspective  toward  the  game  world  and  new  player experiences.  The theatrical concepts of pioneers such as Brecht and Boal questioned the  established  traditions  of  the  stage  as  an  off-limits  and  secluded  space.  In  a  comparable tradition, the camera work in the original The Sims does not pull  players  onto  the  virtual  stage  but  can  distance  them  from  the  represented  virtual dollhouses in which the characters live. The visualization still provides  a narrative perspective—that of the onlooking controller—but this perspective  includes an analytical distance to the character. I look at the Sim character of a  single mother with two kids and low income. The distance between player and  virtual character is a powerful tool that not necessarily excludes players but  involves them differently in the game world. The Sims can be extremely engag- ing and addictive precisely because not staging the player directly in the game  world is part of its ingenious design. Finding one’s role in relation to the ﬁ c- tional world in this setup is a challenge. The player is participating in the Sims’  daily struggles and immersed in them but not as an actor on the virtual stage.  Players can be highly engaged in the game and are likely to be immersed in  the ﬁ ctional universe  the virtual replica of a North American suburb , but they  experience no signiﬁ cant level of presence in this world. They have a strong  projected relation to it, comparable to our fascination with reality TV. We like  our Sim because we look at him and not through his eyes.  The SimCity series takes this distance one step further. In SimCity, interac- tors shape the development of a virtual city in a game of urban planning and   Players in the Video Game Space  221   management.  Building  a  police  station  in  one  suburb  might  decrease  the  crime rate; building better transportation systems might improve the trafﬁ c  ﬂ ow; the city appears as a complex system that needs careful balancing. To  be able to conduct this operation on the game world, players and their interac- tive options remain unaffected by the game space. They remain at a critical  distance,  which  enables  them  to  analyze  the  situation.  Although  they  are  addressed  as  mayors  of  the  virtual  city,  power  cuts  to  the  town  hall  in  the  ﬁ ctional world do not affect the player’s interactive access. Trafﬁ c jams do not  slow  down  the  spatial  navigation  toward  a  hotspot  that  needs  attention.  A  higher level of crime might ruin one’s public rating as a virtual mayor but it  never threatens the player’s character directly—one cannot get robbed, killed,  or run over in SimCity. The player is engaged but stays external to the game  world.  Instead of seeing the player in a ﬁ xed, almost external position, Friedman  sees the narrative perspective in SimCity as a constantly shifting one due to  the game’s functionality. Players participate in a wide range of planning and  administrative  issues  to  keep  a  virtual  city  prosperous  and  are  constantly  switching tasks. He argues that the player positioning changes so fast that a  player  ultimately  identiﬁ es  with  the  virtual  environment  “as  a  whole,  as  a  single system” and that, as a consequence, the user identiﬁ es “less with a role than with a process”  1995, 9; italics in original . At other times he concludes  for  another  simulation  game,  Sid  Meier’s  Civilization  II   Meier  and  Shelley  1996 : “you do not identify with any of these subject positions so much as  with the computer itself”  Friedman 1999, 11; italics in original . This points  back to the computer as a tool and its rule-based technical aspects. In these  situations, players look through the mediated plane and see the mechanisms  underneath.  The  level  of  presence  in  the  3D  virtual  world  is  low,  but  the  awareness of the underlying rule-based plane is high.  The  necessary  distance  to  the  character  implies  a  distance  to  the  virtual  space.  This  effect  might  be  very  helpful  in  certain  game  settings,  but  it  is  apparent that these game settings apply virtual space either as a distancing  factor or they are not utilizing the full potential of real-time 3D game spaces.  Conceptually, The Sims could be played in a 2D view. In fact, a basic 2D view  is used by comparable titles such as Creatures  Grand 1997  and Little Computer  People  Crane 1985 . Sometimes players can explore the space much more in  other  engagements  beyond  the  core  gameplay.  For  example,  The  Sims  2 includes Machinima production tools that turn the game world into a produc- tion studio. Machinima artists use these tools to narrate the virtual space and  transform the ﬂ at playground into a deeper cinematic space. One cannot say  the same about the use of space in the basic gameplay.  Chapter 13  222   Figure  13.2 Creatures   top  left ;  SimCity   top  right ;  Little Computer People   left ;  The  Sims  right ; space is visually detached from the player  At times, a game’s step from 2D to 3D reveals the necessary adjustments  in  functionality  as  well  as  presentation  strategy.  One  example  is  Lemmings  D. Jones 1991 , in which the player has to lead groups of seemingly suicidal  virtual lemmings through a number of 2D spatial puzzles. Lemmings can have  different  abilities  that  can  be  activated  by  the  player  in  order  to  direct  the  lemmings’ spatial behavior and lead them through a level. Players can trigger  their lemmings to block, build, or dig, but the game does not provide any  elaborate  control  over  the  camera  work.  Visual  exploration  is  not  an  issue  because the levels are clearly laid out. Through careful planning and timed  execution of these abilities, the player has to guide the lemmings through the  speciﬁ c level, solve the spatial puzzles, and lead the clueless lemmings to safety  and into the next puzzle. As in SimCity, players remain “gods” and never enter  the levels themselves. They do not become part of the game space but operate  on it and its inhabitants. In a setting like that, the map can be the problem   Players in the Video Game Space  223   itself and the player’s relation to it remains ﬁ xed. But the very moment one  adds operational 3D worlds, the conditions of the game change and a ﬁ xed  player positioning outside the game world starts to give way to a more direct  involvement in the game space. One of the numerous sequels to the original  Lemmings game, 3D Lemmings  Hall and Thomas 1995 , copies the original’s  principal design but adds 3D virtual space as its main new gameplay element:  in the game’s introductory sequence a former 2D lemming literally discovers  the third dimension. With that discovery, the conditions of the basic setup  change completely and the player positioning is very different. The 3D game  not  only  includes  elaborate  camera  controls  but  also  features  a  “virtual  lemming” mode where the player inhabits one of the game characters.  The feature can become important at times, for example, when the default  camera views cannot reach certain spots on the level. In such a case omnipres- ence and god-like distance are no longer supporting the necessary gameplay  features due to the new spatial and visual conditions. The god-player has to  descend into the virtual world and choose a role because the 3D space demands  his presence.  Operational 3D spaces like the one at work in 3D Lemmings, which allow  the player to enter the playground with all its possibilities and restrictions,  call for elaborate presentation forms that enable ﬂ exible player positioning in  relation to the game space. As much as 3D Lemmings quotes the game mechan- ics of its predecessor, it is an entirely different game due to its 3D game world  and the resulting gameplay, the effects of the surrounding game space on the  player’s interactions, and the different game experience that calls for a new  and ﬂ exible player positioning.  Players  have  learned  to  read  changing  camera  viewpoints  and  user- controlled  editing  and  understand  fundamental  features  of  game  space  presentation and changing positions within it. Through growing familiariza- tion,  a  wider  functional  vocabulary  can  be  applied  that  supports  changing  perspectives to suit the unfolding events. The player can play god and mortal  lemming  in  3D  Lemmings  as  well  as  killer  and  detective  in  Indigo  Prophecy. Early on, such a variable assembly of multiple viewpoints visually and con- ceptually  has  been  identiﬁ ed  as  a  powerful  option  in  digital  media   Oren  et al. 1990 . But the new argument for the multitude of different viewpoints  derives from the titles’ spatiality and plays with the generation and under- standing of space. It is not only a question of classic role-playing but also of  spatial positioning. Multiple perspectives might be not a narrative option but  necessary to understand a given 3D virtual space.  In the survival horror game Siren, the player has to lead various characters  through  a  zombie-infested  nightmare  world.  Control  usually  switches  from   Chapter 13  224   Figure 13.3 Lemmings; the original 2D world  left ; 3D Lemmings  right  dealing with the  third dimension  mission  to  mission  among  a  number  of  main  characters.  Each  time  a  new  mission starts and the player’s controls transfer to a new character, this virtual  hero starts at a different time and space of the game setting. Only by playing  all  missions  in  the  best  possible  way  do  the  pieces  of  the  jigsaw  puzzle  assemble to form a whole and the interconnections among the various states  and  characters  become  clearer.  In  one  mission  I  might  control  an  arrogant  university professor, in another a blind girl and her dog, in yet another an old  man.  However,  the  events  and  character  storylines  only  add  up  to  the  full  picture of the haunted island when combined. But this is not the only way  that Siren  enforces  the  idea  of  player  repositioning  during  gameplay.  As  discussed  in  section  7.8,  I  use  the  game’s  speciﬁ c  sight-jacking  feature  to  temporarily  inhabit  my  enemies.  I  constantly  check  nearby  zombies’  views  and  movement  patterns  to  plan  a  route  through  these  dangers.  I  zap  from  undead  to  undead  to  virtual  hero  to  sidekick  character  to  dog  and  back  in  what  feels  like  channel  hopping  between  different  perspectives  toward  the  same game space.  Players of Siren have to form an image of the game space through constant  perspective  change.  Siren  has  been  criticized  for  being  too  difﬁ cult  in  this  regard  and  the  problems  of  its  presentation  have  been  discussed  earlier  in  section  7.8  on  interactive  montage,  but  it  illustrates  a  fundamental  under- standing of how game world and ﬂ exible player positioning can depend on  each other. Whether in the overall predeﬁ ned setting or the single location,  the “whole” is always fragmented into multiple viewpoints and positionings.  Players are situated in the game space, but only through countless changes of  the  perspective  can  the  player  make  sense  of  the  game  world  in  Siren.  The  value of a player as active participant in multiple roles reaches from the critical  distance of SimCity, to the necessary role change due to the game functionality   Players in the Video Game Space  225   in 3D Lemmings, to the analytical, multilayered spatial reading of Siren. Because  virtual space demands a positioning of the player in relation to it, functional  3D video game spaces signiﬁ cantly increase the push toward a role, and mul- tiple roles can be the only useful way to convey the space—this may be via a  critical distance or immersive engagement. Roles and the way they connect a  player to a game world stand out as a player-focused approach to shape the  game  experience.  Roles  become  complex  and  large-scale  conglomerates  of  evocative narrative elements as they provide and exclude certain elements of  the game world to the player. With a growing literacy in games a wider and  more ﬂ exible approach to different roles emerges. Ultimately, functional game  spaces  encourage  a  dynamic  usage  of  these  roles.  This  illustrates  a  growing  complexity of these titles. As players learn to read a game space as a complex  spatiotemporal setting, multiple roles position the player in different perspec- tives toward the game world and assist in a deeper exploration of it.  Chapter 13  226   14  Story Maps  Evocative narrative elements, ﬂ exible structural formats, guidance in the pre- sentation,  dynamic  player  positioning  through  functionality—all  aim  to  support a meaningful game space. The following pages look at how they shape  a player’s understanding of the game world. To discuss the players’ compre- hension, we return to the notion of the cognitive map. As discussed earlier,  players’ navigation in a 3D virtual world depends on the creation of a cogni- tive map of the space just as it does in the physical world. A story map is the  result  of  this  reading  of  the  game  space  in  combination  with  the  directed  evocative narrative elements encountered along the way. The game space, the  events it includes, and the position of the player in relation to them are dra- matized and contextualized. The narrative evocative elements at work do their  best to affect the cognitive map. The result is the story map that consists of  a form of cognitive map grown from the interplay of presentation and func- tionality, guidance and player positioning. Ultimately, every story map is a  cognitive map that has been heavily inﬂ uenced by evocative narrative elements  as the player experienced them in the game space. To clarify this new term  further, this chapter examines and exempliﬁ es the importance of the cognitive  map for virtual environments. The connection between narrative and cognitive  maps has also been discussed in cultural studies  e.g., Jameson 1991, 1999 ,  but the following paragraphs clarify how this connection in the video gaming  context depends on a game’s spatiality.  Numerous  experiments  have  been  conducted  that  emphasize  the  impor- tance of cognitive mapping in virtual environments  for an introduction, see  Péruch  et  al.  2000 .  Concentrating  on  navigation  in  virtual  worlds,  Elvins,  Nadeau,  and  Kirsh   1997   tested  the  importance  of  landmarks  in  virtual    environments  and  proved  their  effectiveness,  especially  in  the  setting  of  a  virtual cityscape. They concluded that landmark features in their virtual world  had to be in certain proximity to support users’ orientation. Steck and Mallot  also  investigated  the  use  of  landmarks  in  virtual  spaces  and  distinguished  between local and global ones. Supporting Elvins, Nadeau, and Kirsh, their  ﬁ ndings prove the value of both kinds of landmarks for navigation in virtual  spaces  Steck and Mallot 2000 .  Offering advice in the assembly of those structures, Vinson suggests various  guidelines based on Kevin Lynch’s work and argues that they help to avoid  distortion from the graphically represented data. Among these guidelines are:  a designer should arrange the environment’s paths and edges in a grid-like  form, the landmarks’ main axes should align with the grid’s main axes, and  each  landmark’s  main  axes  should  align  with  those  of  the  other  landmarks   Vinson  1999,  283;  related,  see  also  Chen  1999  for  spatial  navigation  of  information visualization and Sparacino, Davenport, and Pentland 1999 for  navigation of news through a virtual city space . Vinson is focusing clearly on  basic usability issues. A dramatic impact—often the goal for game worlds—is  not covered by his guidelines.  Darken works in the ﬁ eld of spatial recognition in virtual spaces, naviga- tion, and wayﬁ nding  Darken and Sibert 1996; Darken, Allard, and Achille  1998; Darken and Banker 1998; Darken and Peterson 2002 . His work often  refers  back  to  the  use  of  real-time  3D  spaces  as  training  areas  for  activities  in  physical  environments,  such  as  training  for  armed  forces,  comparing  the  applicability  of  virtual  settings  to  physical  ones.  Again,  the  focus,  by  and  large,  is  on  the  usability  of  these  worlds  mainly  in  reference  to  real- world tasks.  In the examples mentioned previously, Kevin Lynch’s concepts were mainly  used to present data visualization or to optimize orientation in virtual space.  Many of those projects use 3D worlds as training spaces for real-world tasks,  but  they  do  not  focus  on  the  needs  of  video  games  that  provide  spaces  for  virtual  drama.  Video  game  spaces  demand  navigation  and  orientation,  but  they rarely present their content in the most open and immediately accessible  manner. Instead, game worlds reveal their elements in an engaging and stimu- lating way. That is why section 3.5 suggested dramatic representation, com- prehensible multilayered access, and timing rhythm as additional features in  game worlds and added them to more usability-driven criteria. That is also  why  a  dramatic  and  dynamic  player  positioning  replaces  a  neutral  “user.”  Distortions,  surprises,  and  disorientation  when  “losing  one’s  way”  restrict  usability and accessibility but can enhance immersion and drama in a game.  They  can  be  devices  to  create  suspense  or  other  forms  of  pleasure.  Because   Chapter 14  228   game spaces have their own agenda, they operate in their own ways to support  this kind of engagement.  The shape of the virtual environment does not have to be completely clear  from  the  start  or  even  fully  explored  by  the  end  of  the  gaming  experience,  but it does have to evoke a striking impact. Video game spaces rightfully can  be seen as mnemonic spaces, but they differ from the aforementioned projects  insofar as the information in them is dramatized to achieve this impact. The  density of evocative elements and the dramatization of space try to support a  close  net  of  engaging  references  in  the  player’s  cognitive  map.  In  fact,  the  main value of such a story map in games is not navigation but dramatic con- textualization. Players can be lost, but as long as they remain engaged, the  story map eventually improves.  Games position their evocative elements to make sure that a location is not  only a visual cue or a point in a coordinate system, but also can be a feared  obstacle,  a  safe  home  base,  or  a  crowning  achievement.  Strict  guidelines  as  formulated  by  Vinson  or  Elvins,  Nadeau,  and  Kirsh  do  not  address  this.  Another element that is underrepresented in the mentioned projects is guided  visualization. Instead of the ﬁ rst-person point of view, which dominates these  research projects, video game spaces can come to life through complex cine- matic mediation. The narrative ﬁ lter of the camera can create a role as it situ- ates spatial elements and events in relation to the player. Through its gaze, a  certain identity and meaning can be assigned to each structure as well as to  each event, almost independently from their geometrical form. The interactor,  then, has become an active participator in often multiple roles. Unlike in the  aforementioned  projects,  games  can  shift  player  positioning  at  any  given  moment. It is because of that shift that a player can make sense of the overall  situation in games like Indigo Prophecies or Siren. This positioning shapes the  story map because it makes sure that the event is read from a certain perspec- tive. The reading is not only a product of the events and their spatiotemporal  and conditional setting, but also shaped by their narration through the camera  and positioning.  Like any cognitive map, a story map is a highly personalized interpretation  of the data presented. But more then other environments, virtual worlds can  shape the dramatic representation, which directly impacts the comprehension.  The cognitive map in video game spaces is built on the experience and inter- action with narrative evocative elements. Their presentation and functionality  is not random but based on the rule-based plane. It is up to the designers of  the video game space to deliver the evocative narrative elements that support  the construction of the story map in such a way that the reading allows for a  meaningful  interpretation.  It  is  part  of  the  player’s  “work”  to  deliver  the   Story Maps  229   comprehension  of  the  game  universe  and  to  act  upon  it.  In  contrast  to  the  cognitive map generated primarily for orientation, a story map aims not at an  accurate  understanding  of  Euclidian  space  but  of  spatialized  drama  and  its  setting; it combines navigation of drama, ﬁ lm, and interactive space.  Various researchers in the ﬁ eld of literary studies have targeted the com- bination  of  space  and  narrative.  Brooks  refers  to  a  metaphorically  spatial  uncovering  of  plot  elements  in  literary  works,  quoting  a  Sherlock  Holmes  story in which Holmes traces the original crime both spatially and temporally  during  his  investigations  that  form  the  detective  story  itself   Brooks  1984,  26 . Murray combines space and story  1997, 131–132 , likewise, Ryan points  toward  the  “text-as-world”  metaphor  in  a  model  of  the  textual  space  as  a  “three-dimensional environment to be lived in, an area for travel, a landscape  and a geography to be discovered in time. It is mapped by the bodily move- ments of characters from location to location”  2001b, 195 .  But the closest literary concept to story maps is Herman’s theory of the  storyworld.  He  deﬁ nes  “storyworlds”  as  “mental  models  of  who  did  what  to  and with whom, when, where, why, and in what fashion in the world to which  recipients relocate—or make a deictic shift—as they work to comprehend a  narrative”  2002, 9 . Herman describes the connection between narrative and  his storyworlds: “narrative can also be thought of as systems of verbal or visual  cues prompting their readers to spatialize storyworlds into evolving conﬁ gura- tions of participants, objects, and places”  ibid., 263; italics in original . Sto- ryworlds are seen as the cognitive results of the story-making process cued by  the author and completed by readers. Herman indicates that Kevin Lynch’s  structural elements of cognitive maps can be traced in them  ibid., 279  in  a  way  that  is  parallel  to  the  concept  of  story  maps  for  video  game  spaces  proposed here.  The  difference  between  the  concept  of  story  maps  and  Herman’s  story- worlds  grows  from  their  differing  creation  and  spatial  precision.  Herman  focuses on the creation of space through a linear literary-based system, while  story maps evolve during the exploration of a visual descriptive and interactive  virtual  environment  from  which  a  narrative  understanding  of  the  space  is  generated. Space and spatial understanding in storyworlds are achievements  of the discourse. In contrast, the virtual space in a video game world stages  the discourse. The game space is not purely imagined, but is itself an expres- sive  and  functional  element.  Herman  concentrates  on  the  creation  of  space  through  a  narrative.  He  does  not  investigate  spatial  systems  and  how  they  generate narrative.  Both approaches lead to cognitive maps that are heavily inﬂ uenced by nar- rative. But there is a signiﬁ cant difference between a reader comprehending   Chapter 14  230   a  linear  literary  text  evoking  a  storyworld,  and  a  user  creating  a  story  map  from the interactive exploration of game space. The precise visuals and func- tional  architectural  vocabulary  describe  the  latter  process  much  more  accu- rately  than  textual  descriptions  that  are  the  basis  for  Herman’s  approach.  Because their spatial presentation is precise, virtual spaces can deliver mul- tiuser 3D worlds that allow interactors to share a space and be active in it and  in  relation  to  each  other—up  to  the  highest  detail.  Players  can  understand  the spatial relationship between each other as well as map the surrounding  structures. The same precision cannot be achieved by literary texts, where the  individual  imagination  rather  than  a  shared  visual  cue  create  an  image  of  a location.  It is possible to share a room in the text-based worlds of MUDs, but the  spatial interaction between users enabled through literary ciphers stays wide  open for interpretation. This is by no means a negative effect as players in a  MUD can be highly engaged with their individual interpretations of the game  world.  It  can  be  a  highly  motivating  factor  that  these  textual  descriptions  allow a wide range of possible interpretations. However, it is impossible to  play  a  session  of  Counter-Strike,  a  multiuser  computer  game  that  relies  on  precise  and  shared  spatial  understanding,  in  any  literary  form  that  would  provide comparable spatial functionality. Literary description is visually less  precise than the visual-spatial description provided by the moving image. The  processing  of  rule-based  spaces  allows  the  computer  to  provide  such  shared  environments in which the exact position of any player, any structure, every  single bullet and movable object are indisputably deﬁ ned and can be shared  due to this clarity.  However, although Herman stays within the literary tradition, his incor- poration  of  cognitive  science  and  his  reference  to  spatiality  emphasize  the  same  connection  of  narrative  and  space  that  is  made  here.  No  matter  how  detailed the description of the world is, the player’s comprehension of it is  still  a  cognitive  process  and  it  is  here  that  story  maps  mirror  Herman’s  storyworlds.  Among  the  researchers  who  explicitly  step  away  from  literary  texts  and  toward video game spaces, Fuller and Jenkins  1995  outline parallels between  travel journals and travels in virtual locations. They point out the importance  of a spatial structuring of content within a spatially explorable immersive game  world, as opposed to a textually described world. Their comparison implies that  cognitive  mapping  of  the  virtual  space  is  necessary,  as  only  an  understood  space can be translated into a travel log. Ryan refers to this approach: “If the  body in space is the dominant theme of VR narratives, the most important  component of the plot will be the setting, and the narrative structures will   Story Maps  231   be predominantly epic: the user will explore fantastic landscapes, navigate a  space fragmented into multiple domains  the rooms of a castle, the diversiﬁ ed  geography of an island, even the books of a library , take possession of virtual  worlds through movement and action, or achieve intimacy with the environ- ment”  2001b, 322 .  Like this argument, Jenkins as well as Ryan connect the narrative elements  with  the  spatial  ones,  arguing  that  one  comes  to  life  through  the  other.  Numerous researchers have picked up on this thought  for an overview, see  von Borries, Walz, and Böttger 2007 . Friedman goes one step further, arguing  that “computer simulations bring the tools of narrative to mapmaking, allow- ing the individual not simply to observe structures, but to become experien- tially  immersed  in  their  logic”   1995,  9 .  Friedman  offers  a  comparable  concept to the story map proposed here: “geography itself is not the protago- nist; rather, the protagonist’s experience of geography structures the narrative”   forthcoming, 17 . But Friedman’s conclusions that a map in a simulation is  “the hero of the story”  ibid.  contradicts the concept of the story map pro- posed here. Space contains the triggers for comprehension, but it is not the  hero of the story. A story map is the result of a player’s comprehension of the  discourse  with  the  video  game  space.  It  is  not  present  in  the  game  itself  but evoked by it.  Finally,  Champion  combines  vistas  and  encounters  in  virtual  space  to  “memento  maps”   2003 ,  which  are  combined  with  the  spatial  cognitive  maps. The functionality of memento maps covers the user’s memory of past  events. Consequently, Champion argues for a virtual heritage based on past  events   see  also  Champion  and  Dave  2003 .  Past  events,  indeed,  form  an  important part of the story map, but in contrast to the “memento map,” any  story map includes expectations and intentions by the user reaching into pos- sible future events. In order to remain active in a navigable game space, players  have to think ahead, project space, and drama yet to come. Game worlds are  not  only  aimed  to  improve  spatial  navigation—a  feature  that  Champion  points out as the main feature of his model—but at the development of a past,  present,  and  future  meaning  of  the  game  world.  Players  select  their  own  experiences and use them as personal navigation devices. The “memento map”  with its focus on orientation and comprehension and organization of the past  is only one half of the story map.  Story maps draw from the presented range of approaches but take an own  position in this ﬁ eld. They are an extension of the established concept into  the new domain of 3D game spaces. The following pages aim to expand the  inﬂ uence further into the social plane and demonstrate how past interactions  and shared events improve the forming of the story map.  Chapter 14  232   15  Places of Shared Stories  More than a decade ago, Provenzo argued that in the form of computer games,  interactive digital environments “are redeﬁ ning the symbolic underpinnings  of our culture”  1991, 33 . Thanks to their massive presence and impact on  other media, the role of video games today has certainly come closer to that  claim.  Games  have  become  widespread  cultural  artifacts.  As  a  result  video  game  spaces  increasingly  become  places  of  cultural  practice  and  cultural  signiﬁ cance.  How do they incorporate this quality? This chapter will follow the devel-  opment of story maps as they enter a shared cultural sphere.  15.1  Emergent Places  Establishing some form of hierarchy between the ﬁ ve planes of video game  space depends on the perspective. If one starts from the player’s perspective,  then one might argue that they seem to keep on adding to each other from  the moment the computer is switched on. Players open up a play space and  are  confronted  with  the  mediated  world  based  on  the  rule-based  plane.  Through the discourse they shape a ﬁ ctional world based on the given signs  as well as their expectations and information collected from the packaging,  commercials,  and  other  media.  They  project  some  rules  and  logic  into  the  image and adjust their interaction to that. While the original ﬁ ctional plane  is a highly unique one, the precision of the space’s presentation and the shared  functionality allow for effective sharing of navigable and distinct space. Shared  space offers players shared events that include shared evocative elements. Ele- ments  of  the  social  plane  are  interwoven  with  all  other  analytical  planes:    through the ideas of designers and algorithms implemented by coders, it is  reﬂ ected  in  the  rule-based  plane;  its  speciﬁ cs  can  attract  a  group  of  players  whose use of these rule systems can outgrow the virtual and ﬂ ow into the play  space. In other words, video games as cultural artifacts are connected to the  social  underpinnings  of  our  culture  on  multiple  levels.  Video  game  spaces  offer the opportunity to anchor cultural practice precisely at a certain location  and time in a 3D world.  The academic community early acknowledged the relevance of virtual space  for cultural practice and social activities. Researcher did work to investigate  the shaping of virtual communities  e.g., Bruckman 1992; Rheingold 1993 ,  the question of a user’s identity in this world  e.g., Turkle 1996; Stone 1998 ,  and  the  awareness  of  other  users  present  in  the  environment   e.g.,  Donath  1997 ; as well as the impact of digital media on society in general  see, e.g.,  Castells 1996, 1997, 1998 or Mitchell 1999 . Recent work looked especially  at  massively  multiplayer  online  role-playing  games  and  investigated  their  social networking  e.g., Williams 2003; T. L. Taylor 2006 , persuasive games   Bogost 2007 , and the Serious Games movement. Each of these topics high- lights cultural tropes.  In the ﬁ eld of video game spaces, many researchers have found social spatial  behavior transferring from the real to the virtual environments. Social conven- tions have been found in text-based chat worlds as well as in graphical mul- tiuser worlds  Becker and Mark 1998 . The emerging social meaning has been  identiﬁ ed  by  Harrison  and  Dourish  as  the  effect  that  creates  “places”  from  virtual “spaces”  1996 . The placeness of a virtual space depends on the player’s   social   interaction  as  the  interactor  realizes  the  potential  meaning  of  the  virtual  space,  comprehends  it,  and  acts  upon  it.  Virtual  places  are  created  through the whole of this experience.  Transfer of even simple social behavior into virtual worlds adds immense  complexity.  In  multiuser  spaces  the  interaction  among  players  constantly  changes  the  spatial  conditions  and  mirrors  social  spatial  behavior.  A  basic  example is the distance between virtual bodies during their interaction. For  example, the private sphere of the space encircling a single user-avatar depends  on  spatial  positioning  and  indicates  a  spatial  form  of  interaction  that  is  directly imported from our behavior in the physical world  Becker and Mark  1998; Schroeder and Axelsson 2000; T. L. Taylor 2002 . As in real life, players  seem to acknowledge this personal space and the immediate surroundings of  user-avatars seem to mirror real-life private spheres. They carry the notion of  intimacy that can be invaded or respected through spatial behavior, and users  tend  to  react  if  these  spaces  around  their  user-avatars  are  invaded.  Such  an  effect  clearly  depends  on  spatial  conﬁ gurations:  the  positioning  of  different   Chapter 15  234   user-avatars in relation to each other. It provides a notion of intimacy depend- ing on the underlying game engine.  Other examples of spatialized social interaction in multiuser game worlds  are:  dance  festivals  that  use  the  spatial  movement  of  avatars   T.  L.  Taylor  2002, 48; Matsuda, Miyake, and Kawai 2002, 20 , formation of virtual group  assemblies  Becker and Mark 1998, 9–10 , battle formations of player parties,  or virtual demonstrations that become meaningful on the grounds of the sheer  spatial presence of user-avatars in a certain location at a certain moment  from  Morningstar and Farmer 1991 to T. L. Taylor 2006 . Virtual demonstrations  have  spread  throughout  online  worlds,  whether  in  the  early  worlds  such  as  Lucasﬁ lm’s Habitat or Ultima Online or more recent environments such as Second Life, World of Warcraft, or Star Wars Galaxies. Depending on the individual  protest, a demonstration in an online world can expand upon the shared rule- based plane. Virtual demonstrations can actually break this rule-based plane  by affecting the server. If large groups assemble at a single location, they clog  up  these  world  sections,  slowing  the  game  to  a  standstill.  In-game  spatial  behavior,  thus,  can  affect  the  hardware  performance  and  by  extension  the  rule-based space, and with it the playing experience of not only the players  involved in the protest but every player logged on to that server. So whether  it is at the Theed starport in Star Wars Galaxies or the Ironforge auction house  in World of Warcraft where a protest is staged in the virtual game world also  affects  the  underlying  server,  namely  the  Intrepid  server  of  Sony  Online  in  the case of Star Wars Galaxies and the Argent Dawn server of Blizzard in the  case of World of Warcraft. In both cases, the demonstrations that were staged  at these locations addressed in-game actions. A social issue, grown within the  player community from a personal one to a shared cause, became a topic for  all  players  as  it  forced  itself  upon  the  hard-  and  software  of  the  rule-based  space.  On  these  occasions,  the  Theed  starport  or  the  Ironforge  auction  house form social places with relevance expanding far beyond their polygon  structures. They constitute public spheres that stretch across all ﬁ ve planes.  With the growing interdependencies of virtual worlds and physical spaces,  protests  are  no  longer  limited  to  ﬁ ctional  in-world  issues.  In  January  2007  many  inhabitants  of  Second  Life  gathered  in  an  organized  protest  against  a  virtual ofﬁ ce of the Front National, an all-too-real right-wing political party.  The protest developed into a surreal battle fought with weapons only available  in  virtual  worlds,  from  holographic  displays  to  exploding  pigs  and  gatling  guns  Au 2007 . They were a display of the creativity of the demonstrating  users but they did not affect the virtual ofﬁ ce of the Front National. Bullets  and explosions left no traces on the Front; no polygon was destroyed. What  was effectively brought to a standstill was the server that hosted this area of   Places of Shared Stories  235   Figure 15.1  The Martin Luther King Jr. sun over the site of the Front National protest in  Second Life  Au 2007   Second  Life.  The  same  problems  of  strain  on  the  server  mentioned  earlier  applied here too, but the protest also highlighted innovative ways in which  massively  multiplayer  online  games  can  react  to  political  challenges.  For  example, to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s work  as opposed to the anti- immigrant rhetoric of the Front National , a special sun was created for Second Life with King’s face inset.  In  the  form  of  the  sun  image,  a  political  statement  was  presented  that  carried throughout the whole grid of the online world, including the ofﬁ ces  of the Front National. Virtual bodies—spectral objects like the sun as well as  player-controlled  avatars—shape  space  into  meaningful  arrangements.  A  strong parallel to Lefebvre’s concept of space as product of social interaction  becomes  particularly  apparent  in  these  formations  and  interactions  of  human-controlled  activists.  But  virtual  spaces  are  highly  directed  in  the  way  they  can  be  used.  Game  masters  can  forcibly  teleport  avatars,  change   Chapter 15  236   access conditions, or even ban players. The protest against the Front National  ended with the withdrawal of the virtual party headquarters and the victory  of the protesting users. However, Linden Labes, the operating company for  Second Life, can and did break up other demonstrations. Unless one hacks the  main  engine,  the  rule-based  system  and  its  controller  can  always  suppress  these kind of activities through their in-game restrictions.  15.2  Functionality in Social Virtual Places  These restrictions can take extreme form in the game design and be manifested  in the game space. Some multiuser game spaces only allow virtual confronta- tions as their main functionality. Battle arenas are the sole spatial structures for  the constant ﬁ ghting in Quake III: Arena. Other game spaces focus on verbal  user-user  communication,  enabling  interactors  to  meet  in  virtual  environ- ments, trade objects, and chat with each other on the model of a communal  piazza or marketplace as seen in the 2D worlds of VZones. The more recent  Habbo Hotel  Karjalainen and Kyrölä 2000  uses the metaphor of virtual urban  spaces to support its user community in their chat and customization activities.  The now extinct Cyber Park  n.n. 1997  as well as the current Second Life offered  a variety of ways to give objects, articles, or virtual money to other users, but  largely excluded the possibility of stealing them. In contrast, the “capture the  ﬂ ag” mode of Quake III: Arena explicitly asks two groups of opposing players  meeting in a shared virtual space to steal the enemy’s ﬂ ag. The Quake series  lacks market places and designated chat zones but features spatial structures  that  dramatize  this  action.  These  maps  include  narrow  bottlenecks   choke  points  or open areas that allow for speciﬁ c game-playing styles that are part of  this particular interaction. The same is true for Counter-Strike, which unlike  Quake has a form of equipment shopping selection in every round as it allows  players to reequip their avatars at the start. But this “marketplace” is not a place  but a temporal phase. One has only a short time to make the selection at the  start of a new round. There is no visible piazza or market. If there are market- places in the virtual game world of Counter-Strike, as in the cs_italy map, then  they are not for shopping but are only differently shaped parts of the battle- ground. What you see is not what you get because the action is restricted to  ﬁ ghting even though the locations can be places of more peaceful social interac- tion. Even though the functionality seems to simplify the spatial participation,  playing these game spaces is still a spatial discourse.  A game of capture the ﬂ ag in Quake III: Arena is, in fact, a complex spatial  and logical negotiation between all the interactors and the in-world compo- nents. I am teleported into a closed arena together with two handfuls of other   Places of Shared Stories  237   players. We immediately split up into two different teams. Our goal: to steal  the opposing team’s virtual ﬂ ag, battle in close-range and long-range combat,  protect  teammates,  recapture  our  team-ﬂ ag  if  it  is  stolen,  and  collect  extra  equipment  spread  throughout  the  virtual  world  to  enhance  our  ﬁ ghting  ability. The battle is frenetic and constantly changes as my teammates rush  forward or defend our base, but the better my team gets, the more directed  and coordinated our actions become. In order to win we organize our interac- tions. An online session in a Worlds Away world or in Habbo Hotel also offers  complex patterns of spatial and logical interconnections, where interactors go  shopping in virtual shops, meet, trade goods, and chat with each other. Both  kinds of world are deﬁ ned by a limited number of functions—one might even  say Proppian functions. Players form very different social spaces through the  use of these functions.  Worlds that are more diverse and cannot be deﬁ ned by a single dominating  interaction  can  spread  different  functionality  between  separate  locations  within the same ﬁ ctional universe. Second Life allows players to own virtual  property and manage it, and to ﬁ ll it with certain features like virtual amuse- ment parks, shops, galleries, ofﬁ ces, or gambling halls. Access and functional- ity can be restricted to these separate elements. The world, to some extent,  subdivides into regions optimized for speciﬁ c functions. A different kind of  zoning is found in the original release of Ultima Online, which allowed players  to battle each other and computer-controlled entities in certain areas of the  world  e.g., dungeons and wilderness zones  while the killing was disabled in  “secure  zones”  that  let  users  chat  and  interact  in  a  peaceful  way   e.g.,  the  virtual cities . The same effect can be achieved through conditional instead of  spatial settings. Everquest does not offer any safe locations but uses the condi- tional “Player Killing” switch that deﬁ nes whether a user-avatar can kill and  be killed by other user-avatars. But Ultima Online’s approach utilized the game  space in a more elaborate and engaging way combining spatial structure with  interactive access. It motivates the condition through an in-game distinction  that works on the level of experiential space, not on the level of abstract con- dition. Players do not have to understand the Player Killing switch as a game  variable, but the same rule is hidden within the virtual world’s explanation  and  context.  In  a  reversal  of  the  unfulﬁ lled  promise  of  the  marketplace  in  Counter-Strike  that  operates  only  as  battleground,  the  city  in  the  original  Ultima Online has specialized interactive conditions that identify it and struc- ture the game’s functionality in relation to other game sections. Digital media  can enforce such a spatialized condition and turn their worlds into pleasant  prisons, where presentation and functionality can merge.  Chapter 15  238   15.3  Quests in Social Virtual Places  The  use  of  the  multiplayer  space  is  harder  to  predict  than  in  single-player  game worlds, but designers can still try to shape the exploration and activity  in them. These structures often take the shape of preplanned events such as  treasure hunts, quests, or communal meetings. But preparing one-off world  events demands signiﬁ cant resources from the designer team. In the case of  the early Habitat online world, it proved so problematic as to be “foolish and  impractical”  Morningstar and Farmer 1991, 288 . King and Borland report  from the beta test for Ultima Online: “When the game opened, it was like the  ﬁ rst few minutes at an amusement park, when kids pour through the gates  to populate a park deserted just moments before. The killing began almost  immediately, as players sought to gain instant points, experience, and levels.  The  ecosystem—plants,  herbivores,  carnivores,  monsters,  and  anything  else  that moved—was decimated too quickly for any of the subtle balancing effects  to show up at all. Literally thousands of programming hours were wiped clean  at the hilts of the beta testers’ swords”  2003, 158 .  Balancing a game world seems like a sisyphean ﬁ ght but there are elements  that allow relatively clear structuring. Instead of controlling the game uni- verse as such, one can concentrate on more speciﬁ c spatial interactions.  One element of the outstandingly successful online game World of Warcraft is that—against Morningstar and Farmer’s view—it offers thousands of quests  throughout its game space. While the in-game creative options are limited  in comparison to other titles  e.g., it does not copy any complex ecosystem  with  any  great  detail  and  no  users  are  allowed  to  build  their  own  spatial  structures  in  the  game  space   it  has  proven  to  be  highly  successful  with  players—so successful that it serves as a model for other online games seeking  to  copy  this  part  of  the  formula.  Notably,  the  originally  rather  open  game  universe  of  Star  Wars  Galaxies:  An  Empire  Divided  was  adjusted  toward  a  comparable  quest-driven  formula   Rausch  and  Kosak  2004 .  The  resulting  predeﬁ ned content elements arranged by the designer team to shape the expe- rience are a powerful and widely accepted approach to position evocative nar- rative elements into quests, but in lieu of the dynamics of player-inhabited  social spaces the alternative is even more promising. Even the most advanced  multiuser  online  world  can  contain  only  a  limited  number  of  predeﬁ ned  quests, and generating procedural quests in dynamic spaces remains the excep- tion  Ashmore and Nitsche 2007 . To stay interesting, this philosophy depends  on user events and emergent play. Players use the evocative narrative elements  during their interactions in a unique way and make them their own through   Places of Shared Stories  239   this  usage.  But  other  user-deﬁ ned  events  can  build  on  top  of  the  already  established structures.  As  outlined  in  chapter  2,  interactors  can  take  control  of  the  options  provided to them by the game developer. They might decide to go on a hunt  for virtual animals, make a virtual discovery journey through unknown terri- tory, or launch a personal vendetta against another interactor in the virtual  world. Or they might decide to use the game stage for unexpected activities  like  the  aforementioned  demonstrations.  The  potential  for  such  events  is  merely provided by the virtual world’s design.  Even very basic worlds with limited interactive elements offer the potential  for  interactors  to  form  self-designed  activities.  The  creators  of  the  PAW∧2 multiuser  online  environment  refer  to  it  as  a  “pre-Stone-Age  world,  which  had almost no tools”  Matsuda, Miyake, and Kawai 2002, 23 . This did not  stop  inhabitants  from  making  creative  use  of  what  little  functionality  was  provided. In the case of PAW∧2 the avatar collision-control feature prevented  characters  from  walking  through  each  other.  It  also  happened  to  allow  one  avatar to stand on top of another. Based on this fundamental setting, interac- tors developed user-deﬁ ned events during which they created avatar pyramids   ibid.,  20 .  These  events  form  a  playful  social  gathering  in  virtual  space,  determined  by  the  user’s  interpretation  and  utilization  of  the  game  world.  The  imaginative  use  of  limited  resources  illustrates  the  power  of  self- designated goals and adopts patterns from improvisational theater that allow  users to apply given functions in multiple self-designed ways.  In the light of this player-driven structuring, the interactor ﬁ nally can be  enabled to shape elements of the spatial setting itself. To make the behavioral  and spatial logic of a piece accessible to the player, the designer has to hand  over the tools of content creation and give up authority over space itself to  the participating interactors. With these tools, players can shape the virtual  world, which then shapes comprehension and narrative. The evocative narra- tive  elements  become  the  expressive  vocabulary  for  the  player  interaction.  They do not carry any single meaning in themselves and do not impose any  predeﬁ ned story but can be arranged by users. In these cases players do not  play “to be told” the space but to tell it themselves. Evocative narrative ele- ments  that  once  remained  in  a  designer’s  exclusive  control  have  to  become  accessible to the player. They become part of the vocabulary and the design  of any virtual stage that might host a player-created fabula. In such an envi- ronment, the network of evocative narrative elements is not predeﬁ ned in a  predesigned package delivered by the designer within the space, but becomes  part of the playing functionality or at least in some other way accessible to  the player. Users can prepare and stage tension and drama without the inter-  Chapter 15  240   position  of  direct  designer  ordinances.  Koster,  a  lead  designer  of  massively  multiplayer  online  role-playing  worlds,  exempliﬁ es  this  with  one  example  from Ultima Online:  Once upon a time, there was a very pleasant little tavern, the Serpent Cross Tavern.  Players could build buildings in U-O [= Ultima Online]. Players could set up these  structures,  and  they  made  them  into  their  own,  and  they  told  their  own  private  mythologies and told their own private stories in ‘em. One day, this group of people  called S-I-N, “sin,” that was their guild abbreviation, decided that they were going  to  walk  around  all  the  player-run  taverns  and  extort  money.  They  formed  a  Maﬁ a.  And they went from tavern to tavern, and they said, we’re going to destroy this place  unless you pay us. And they came one day to the Serpent Cross Tavern—, you know,  they  were  really  boastful  about  it.  They  destroyed  a  whole  bunch  of  role-playing  hotbeds, came one day to the Serpent Cross Tavern, and found an army waiting there  that creamed ‘em. Setting. Expressive setting. That could not have happened without  the  ability  for  players  to  reshape  their  space  and  create  a  location  for  a  narrative.   2001   The ﬁ ghts at the Serpent Cross Tavern, which is located in an area of Ultima  Online called Yew, are recalled also by the attacking Sinister  Sin  guild:  Finally the town rabble of Yew began to try and organize our removal. Every single  non-SiN in the Yew area hated us and wanted our heads. They formed together as a  coalition of role players bound on seeing our demise a new guild named GSH. Our  battles  with  GsH  were  the  funniest  ones,  with  wide-eyed  tales  arriving  from  each  battle.  2007   In Sinister’s version the overall battle is won by the Sin guild. However,  the point here is not the accuracy of the tale but rather that it remains alive  and remembered as localized event in the game space by both sides. Even for  the Sin members, these ﬁ ghts remain legendary and the location and its use  memorable.  15.4  Story Maps in Shared Game Spaces  Although the evolving story maps for this particular expressive setting differ  from interactor to interactor involved in the events, the unfolding activities  in the Serpent Cross Tavern sequence follows the model of the monomyth. Such  a  reading  might  identify  the  Sin  guild  as  a  threat  to  the  status  quo  of  the  current world  the “wound” that threatens to destroy the Serpent Cross Tavern ; the  violation  calls  for  a  response   the  “call  to  adventure” ,  but  it  cannot  be  expected that all users of Ultima Online followed this call  a partial “refusal of   Places of Shared Stories  241   the call” ; those who heed the call organize the opposition  leaders can be seen  as  “mentors” ;  they  gather  and  prepare  for  the  confrontation  of  the  raiding  party   now  already  in  the  world  of  the  speciﬁ c  and  self-deﬁ ned  adventure ;  reaching its climax in the battle  the “supreme ordeal” of this setting, during  which the solidarity of the group, their unity, and effectiveness are tested ;  ending with the enemy’s defeat, the survival of the Serpent Cross Tavern, and  termination of the raids  the healing of the world  due to the dedication of  the defenders. All of these stages are realized on the virtual game stage and  depend on careful timing and execution, but they remain player driven. From  the perspective of the Sin’s history, the event reads as the ﬁ nal historic battle  in Ultima Online won by them, not the Yew defenders. “After that it became  pretty boring on Great Lakes. Nobody to ﬁ ght, no one to kill, no new chal- lenges”  Sinister 2007 . In their perception, their quest to build a dominating  battle guild also had reached its end, and without new challenges the guild  players started to emigrate to other games and into new game spaces.  Without imposing a linear narrative path onto the user, the event develops  as an epic multiparticipant quest, staged at a certain time and place deﬁ ned  by  the  interactors  involved.  When  Jenkins  argues  “for  an  understanding  of  game  designers  less  as  storytellers  and  more  as  narrative  architects”   2004,  121 , we now have to expand this concept to the player, who arranged the  evocative narrative elements through his or her spatial practice in the game  world.  This  user-created  event  will  stay  part  of  the  users’  shared  history  in  the world of Ultima Online and was retold by external observers  and designers,  as in the case of Koster himself . The story also adds to the virtual place the  connotation  of  the  home  of  this  battle,  providing  a  history  and  context  for  the Serpent Cross Tavern and the Yew region not available previously. It adds  character  and  history  to  the  location,  turning  it  from  a  neutral  space  to  a  characterized place. In other words, the events surrounding the tavern serve  to symbolize the players’ different interpretation of the Ultima Online universe,  signifying the spatial structure as a “cultural object” of the resistance against   or for  the maﬁ a-type behavior.  The signiﬁ cance of user-driven events also becomes evident in examples of  negative social interaction in multiuser virtual environments. Dibbell describes  the event of a rape in a MUD  1996, 1999 , which left parts of the virtual  community in this MUD deeply disturbed. But what can be generally con- sidered antisocial behavior can also be an ingenious and creative driving force  in  games.  A  massively  multiplayer-driven  attack  in  Eve  Online   Emilsson  et  al.  2003   saw  a  guild  of  assassins—the  Guiding  Hand  Social  Club— operating for an anonymous client to kill a prominent and extremely powerful  game  player-character,  the  head  of  the  Ubiqua  Seraph  corporation.  The   Chapter 15  242   promised “kill” was documented in screenshots including the ﬁ nal one of the  virtual  body  in  space   Francis  2005 .  Few  activities  would  seem  to  be  less  socially acceptable than a hired murder. It is the declared goal of the Guiding  Hand to bring grief and to crush their targets—but it is done in a role-playing  way  in-game.  They  use  methods  only  available  in-game,  such  as  character  play, forums, or game voice chat  Ethic 2005 . The actual attack is only con- ducted inside the game space. In this particular instance, the attack spread  over  a  range  of  virtual  locations  and  developed  in  carefully  timed  stages  to  have  the  highest  possible  impact.  In  contrast  to  the  Serpent  Cross  Tavern  events, this player-driven quest is described mainly from the perspective of  the successful “bad guys.” The event as well as the following discussion added  considerably to the Guiding Hand’s fame, or notoriety, and remains part of  this community’s legacy.  If  a  game  provides  access  to  these  fundamental  building  blocks  of  its  design, then it has to guarantee the consistency of these building blocks to  keep the evolving virtual storyworld, its events, and conﬂ icts coherent. Expres- sive and functional elements implemented through visuals, acoustic, spatial,  and action-based means have to stay coherent in order to allow a far-reaching  change of the world itself without the danger of destroying its fundamental  mechanics  and  threatening  its  established  cultural  identity.  Ultima  Online generates  a  virtual  world  based  on  a  highly  developed  role-playing  culture  that quotes sword and sorcery themes. Only a defeat of the Sin guild within  the rules of this ﬁ ctional world provides for a meaningful event and story map  generation. If the confrontation had included extra-diegetic elements such as  special weapons not available in the ﬁ ctional world of Ultima Online, the bor- derlines of the ﬁ ctional world would have been violated. The same would be  true if magic forces would enter the tech-driven universe of Eve Online.  “ ‘Abdicating authorship’  .  .  .  doesn’t mean ‘abdicating responsibility,’ for creating  the  rules  and  procedures  of  the  world  is  an  act  of  authorship  that  deﬁ nes  the  space”  Doug Church in Meadows 2002, 54; italics in original . The responsibility  of the designer shifts from the prepackaging of the story elements into one  sjužet to the development of an expressive vocabulary that describes the indi- vidual virtual storyworld sufﬁ ciently, but also allows for a satisfying and cre- ative player access. Event, location, and dramatic context are player-created  and the designer has to provide the necessary building blocks for the player  to become creative. The emerging spatiotemporal arrangements will still be  translated into story maps, but through the countless permutations provided  by players, they gain far more complexity and the possibility spaces expand  greatly. At the same time, the world can become deeper and more locations  have the chance to turn into places.  Places of Shared Stories  243   15.5  Places Forming Cultures  Players get familiar with new game spaces and learn to master them, learn to  read them, and project meaning into them. What they ﬁ nally ﬁ nd in these  spaces,  then,  is  a  new  and  altered  “self.”  So  when  we  look  at  the  future  of  video game spaces, we have to look at the player. The cultural signiﬁ cance of  a game space is instantiated by localized player activity. An event is not hap- pening  “on  the  web”  but  is  localized  in  a  game  world.  This  has  become  obvious  in  multiplayer  online  titles,  but  also  rings  true  in  single-player  worlds. Game spaces have become part of our cultural spheres. Virtual societ- ies can have a “home” in a video game space—one that stretches across the  various planes suggested here but can have a deﬁ ned location in a 3D virtual  stage. Not only is such a “home” the product of a creative process by the player  but—in accordance with Alexander’s concept of the pattern language—it is  also capable of affecting interactors and their behavior. It can become a place  for socialization of the player.  In  past  decades,  television  has  fulﬁ lled  the  role  of  the  “medium  of  the  socialisation of most people into standardized roles and behaviors”  Gerbner  and Gross 1976, 175 . Critics have argued that this has led to a loss of a “sense  of space.” For example:  Electronic  media  [=  especially  television]  have  combined  previously  distinct  social  settings, moved the dividing line between private and public behaviour toward the  private, and weakened the relationship between social situations and physical places.  The  logic  underlying  situational  patterns  of  behaviour  in  a  print-oriented  society,  therefore, has been radically subverted. Many Americans may no longer seem to “know  their place” because the traditionally interlocking components of “place” have been  split  apart  by  electronic  media.  Wherever  one  is  now—at  home,  at  work,  or  in  a  car—one may be in touch and tuned-in.  Meyrowitz 1999, 100   In  experiential  video  game  spaces,  the  “interlocking  components”  are  working  again  because  the  player  can  situate  an  event  in  time  and  space.  Players  might  be  “tuned-in,”  but  “in”  the  games  they  ﬁ nd  a  space.  Video  games relocate us to new worlds to immerse and engage in—but located we  are. They provide narrative ﬁ lters that prepare the stage for new roles available  in these spaces. For better or for worse, we are transformed and situated into  a new context, and we “know our place” in this situation. There are still many  communication  channels  that  do  not  depend  on  such  relocation,  but  game  worlds offer us digital realms that put the place back into our reach.  Although the existing game worlds differ from the envisioned cyberspaces,  they still carry the value for cultural signiﬁ cance called for by early cyberspace   Chapter 15  244   apostles.  Their  initial  hopes  for  the  digital  realms  echo  in  many  current  discussions  in  games  research  such  as  games  “as  art”  or  Serious  Games.  Ultimately,  these  discussions  refer  to  games’  value  as  cultural  artifacts.  To  position an event in time and space is to provide a necessary context for the  growth of such cultural value.  Throughout this book we have encountered a range of elements that affect  the creation, use, and experience of such a cultural space: from architectural  sample structures, to the level of presentation, to variable player positioning,  to the comprehension of space and spatialized events. These elements provide  designers and participating players with a powerful toolbox to use in shaping  their games. Evocative narrative elements are the necessary building blocks  to  implement  structure  and  the  player’s  comprehension  of  them  ultimately  results in the story map, which paints a mental image of the evolving cultural  landscape in the game.  The  greater  our  familiarity  with  video  game  spaces,  the  larger  becomes  their  relevance  for  socialization.  And  the  ﬁ nal  spatial  structure  that  might  close  these  observations,  while  offering  a  glimpse  into  the  future,  is  the  kitchen.  The kitchen is a central part of one’s home—in fact, the oven as place for  meal preparation as well as heating can deﬁ ne the center and heart of a family  home in many cultures. The kitchen is the space of social gathering, of undi- rected communication as well as clear, productive functionality. One might  discuss important family matters or play drums on the cooking pots; both are  acceptable behaviors in a family kitchen. It is the place we keep not only the  necessary nutrition but also our stash of chocolate and ice cream. And it is a  highly unique and personal place. The same variety of events and relevance  can  be  attributed  to  gaming  and  game  worlds.  In  both  kitchens  and  game  worlds, creation and “use” are difﬁ cult to separate and part of a whole experi- ence. As the game worlds turn into acceptable cultural places, communities  discuss and alter them with an ease that was not imagined before.  On a different level, the kitchen metaphor continues to apply when we talk  about technology and literacy. Kitchen equipment helps even untrained cooks  create  meals  with  ease.  Fridges,  juicers,  microwave  ovens,  bread-baking  machines,  mixers,  and  countless  other  appliances  assist  us  in  the  creative  process. In video games, this function is provided by game controllers, graphi- cal  user  interfaces,  game  design,  rule  sets,  and  all  the  other  elements  that  operate  on  the  ﬁ ve  planes  describing  game  spaces.  In  the  context  of  video  game spaces, these technologies mirror the vocabulary and processes that allow  creative  players  to  generate  new  contexts,  new  experiences,  and  new  game  spaces. Players do not only consume  as in a restaurant  but actively create  as   Places of Shared Stories  245   in a kitchen . In the same way that a modern kitchen helps us prepare meals,  game engines assist their players in taking over the virtual space. They encour- age players to accept the challenge posed by dynamic game worlds and become  spacemakers  themselves.  Traces  for  this  development  have  been  important  factors in the role of online communities such as Second Life or A Tale in the  Desert, and they are mirrored in the various networks that game console devel- opers gradually establish. Although it might seem as if companies and com- mercial  interests  are  pushing  these  models,  in  reality  it  is  the  growing  acceptance of game worlds as cultural places that drives them. It is the players’  growing understanding of the video game space as their space—not the com- pany’s space or the designer’s—that is responsible for the change. As video  game spaces have been established, and their colonization has reached a certain  level, we see their inhabitants settling in—and changing the face of the virtual  world again.  What these worlds provide is more than “fun” and more substantial than  entertainment. To stretch the kitchen metaphor further: if we envision games  as food, then we have to be aware of the nutrition they provide. There is always  the need for a quick snack that probably bloats the body without any reason- able nutritional beneﬁ t but that satisﬁ es a sudden urge. There will also be the  deluxe frozen meal, the can of generic tomato soup, the rip-off “taste-alike,”  and  the  cooking  disaster.  There  will  be  large  banquets  and  stellar  achieve- ments that change the way we cook  or play  forever. Without a doubt, there  is always a need for a professional chef, whose experience will result in out- standing results. Unlike the playground, the kitchen features a clear hierarchy  based on knowledge. Cooking also features steep and endless learning curves.  But a “game world as kitchen” has all the tools available to support the neces- sary range of expertise and to improve each player. What really feeds players  are not the recipes of any single established master game developer, but how  they  adapt  these  structures,  use  them,  make  them  their  own.  If  you  are  a  player, the game world is ultimately yours.

Choice Outstanding Academic Title, 2009. The move to 3D graphics represents a dramatic artistic and technical development in the history of video games that suggests an overall transformation of games as media. The experience of space has become a key element of how we understand games and how we play them. In Video Game Spaces, Michael Nitsche investigates what this shift means for video game design and analysis. Navigable 3D spaces allow us to crawl, jump, fly, or even teleport through fictional worlds that come to life in our imagination. We encounter these spaces through a combination of perception and interaction. Drawing on concepts from literary studies, architecture, and cinema, Nitsche argues that game spaces can evoke narratives because the player is interpreting them in order to engage with them. Consequently, Nitsche approaches game spaces not as pure visual spectacles but as meaningful virtual locations. His argument investigates what structures are at work in these locations, proceeds to an in-depth analysis of the audiovisual presentation of game worlds, and ultimately explores how we use and comprehend their functionality. Nitsche introduces five analytical layers—rule-based space, mediated space, fictional space, play space, and social space—and uses them in the analyses of games that range from early classics to recent titles. He revisits current topics in game research, including narrative, rules, and play, from this new perspective. Video Game Spaces provides a range of necessary arguments and tools for media scholars, designers, and game researchers with an interest in 3D game worlds and the new challenges they pose
