Cybersecurity To English  Definitions  An A-to Z list of cybersecurity related terms in this book. Note  that  an  expanded  version  of  the  Cybersecurity  to  English Dictionary is available to purchase separately             Nobody ever made a statue to honor a  committee   Preface  If you are reading this book in its first year of publication, you might be  wondering  why  there  are  so  few  books  on  the  subject  of cybersecurity.  The reasons are simple:    Most cybersecurity experts get paid a lot anyway.   Most of us are really busy.   Very few of us know what we are doing well enough to put our reputation on the line by writing a book on the subject.  We also have to keep up to date. The subject area is evolving fast. As  I  write  this  first  edition,  there  is  not  even  consensus  on  how  to write the word ‘cybersecurity’. Is it one word or two? In the US, the Department  of  Homeland  Security   DHS ,  the  National  Institute  of Standards  and  Technology   NIST   and  the Information Systems Audit & Control Authority  all use the one word version. So does this book.  ISACA   originally   My  aim  has  been  to  create  something  less  technical  and  more informative than other available texts, providing an easy insight into how we got to need cybersecurity, what the implications are and to demonstrate that there are effective methods to control and mitigate the problems.  information   security  and   Attending  multiple  cybersecurity conferences  each  year,  often  as  a  speaker,  I  began  to  realize  in discussions  with  literally  hundreds  of  professionals  just  how  little concise and reliable information was available in the public domain. Most organizations, together with their information and cybersecurity professionals  are  constantly  trying  to  keep  up  with  what  the  latest   threats  are  and  how  to  effectively  measure,  manage  and  monitor them.  Now  that  technology  and  digital  devices  are  a  core  part  of  any organization and even critical to most people at an individual level, it became  apparent  that  almost  everybody  would  like  to  better understand  this  subject  area.  That  means  that  not  just  technical people want to understand cybersecurity.  For that reason, this book is designed to be a great essentials text for anybody who wants to get a broad, rapid and holistic view of the subject  area.  You  do  not  need  any  previous  technical  knowledge. Whenever  any  technical  term  is  used,  you  will  find  a  plain,  non- technical English definition right below its first usage.  Although  I  have  worked  in  security  and  compliance  for  well  over  a decade,  it  was  only  in  2009  that  I  began  to  need  to  specifically review and audit cybersecurity. I was lucky to be sponsored by one of the largest companies in the world to look into both their internal controls and their most significant suppliers.  One of those early pieces of work was to prepare a white paper on the capabilities and limitations of Amazon Web Services, Salesforce and  others.  The  significance  of  the  contract  value  from  the sponsoring  company  provided  me  with  access  to  some  of  the  best cybersecurity  minds  on  the  planet  and  to  a  rapid  and  early appreciation of cyber risks and how to mitigate them.  At around the same time, I was passed one of the most interesting work  packages  ever.  A  Fortune  50  company  commissioned  me  to compile their version 1 of a synchronized set of governance controls that  could  satisfy  all  their  major  global  security,  privacy  and compliance  requirements.  That  required  reviewing,  organizing, deconstructing and reconstructing over 9,000 controls. The finished library  was  less  than  5%  of  the  size  of  the  original   just  under  400 controls  but still met every single relevant requirement.   This  exercise  in  harmonizing  controls,  coupled  with  my  frequent practical reviews of operational environments, gave me a deep view into all of the known risks and how to mitigate or eliminate them.  Fast forward into the present day and it became apparent that any organization now requires a specific cybersecurity policy document. Nobody had a document like this a few years ago.  The  purpose  of  a  cybersecurity  policy  document  is  to  demonstrate that  all  appropriate  risk  and  control  factors  relating  to  technology have  been  sufficiently  considered.  To  my  surprise,  when  I  looked back at the governance controls from 2009, almost every component of the cybersecurity policy was already present. Almost the only item missing  was  the  need  to  pull  together  an  overarching  document  to prove they were all present.  However,  it  is  still  important  to  understand  that  we  are  only  at  the dawn of cybersecurity. Things are going to get worse before they get better.  There are a really large number of cybersecurity jobs on offer around the  world  and  nearly  all  of  them  are  struggling  to  find  suitable candidates. The fact is that very few people were working specifically in the sector until about 2013.  When organizations advertise a role and put in the required section ‘Must  have  at  least  10  years  cybersecurity  experience’  – Cybersecurity  people  chuckle  to  themselves.  We  also  do  not  apply unless  we  are  ‘fond  of  a  treat’   a  British  expression  of  irony suggesting  inviting  pain  and  suffering  on themselves.   Who  wants  to  take  on  the  challenge  of  an  enterprise that lacks even a basic understanding? Well, that depends on how financially committed they really are. Nobody wants to be employed only as a scapegoat.  the  person  enjoys    During the next few years, we will regularly  almost daily at present  see  some  truly  spectacular  stories  hit  the  mainstream  press  about the next organization that got caught with gaps in their cybersecurity defenses. So how is this happening?  It  is  happening  because,  like  anything  new,  we  are  not  yet  mature and stable at using our digital devices.  If  you  imagine  how  things  were  in  the  early  days  of  the  car,  there was  no  clear  idea  about  where  to  locate  the  steering  wheel,  so  it started  out  being  in  the  center  of  the  car  on  many  models.  There were  no  seatbelts,  roll  cages  or  airbags.  People  were  just  amazed that  the  car  moved  without  a  horse  strapped  to  the  front,  so  they started out calling it ‘The Horseless Carriage.’  The current digital era is very like those early days of the car. It is the wild  west  of  technology  out  there  right  now.  A  new  gold  rush.  Kids are  becoming  millionaires,  millionaires  are  becoming  kids  and companies  are  often  unknowingly  staking  everything  on  each  new technology they connect on to their digital ecosystem.  The  speed  and  budget  that  most  of  us  still  apply  to  adopting  new technology is often a risk-based gamble. This book will help you to better understand those risks and how to control them.  Use the right new technologies quickly and you can benefit greatly.  Spend  time  and  money  on  verifying  technology  and  its  security before you use it and you will be safer but you could fall behind your competition.  So  if  now  you  do  want  to  understand  cybersecurity,  the  risks  and how to control them, read on.   Introduction  “If  you  are  not  concerned  about  cybersecurity,  you  don’t  know enough about it.”  I thought those words were just another attempt at fear based selling -  until  I  immersed  myself  in  the  subject  and  saw  that  blind  faith  in digital  devices  was  accelerating  past  the  security  skills  of  most people and organizations that use them.  The  lure  of  lower  costs  and  higher  earnings  encourages  us  all  to adopt  new  technologies  very  quickly.  Do  we  understand  the  risks? Do we want to understand the risks? Do we know anybody who can actually tell us what the risks really are?  Did  you  ever  download  a  free  software  application?  Did  you  ever consider  that  application  was  not  free  –  the  price  was  access  to information on your phone, tablet or computer?  If you want to understand the risks in plain English, without technical clutter, this book is for you. It will give you a broad insight into where we  are,  how  we  got  here,  where  we  are  headed  and  how  to  take effective steps at a personal and organizational level to ensure you are better protected.  The book is designed to form a great story arc. You will get the most from it if you do choose to read it cover to cover.  If you do want to take a more fragmented approach, each chapter is also  designed  to  be  self  contained  and  can  be  read  without knowledge from preceding chapters.  There is also a short Cybersecurity to English guide at the back of this  book  that  allows  you  to  look  up  key  technical  terms  used  in cybersecurity and to get a translation into everyday English.   The  subject  of  cybersecurity  is  incredibly  relevant  to  us  all  and  not understanding  it  poses  personal  and  professional  risks.  This  book provides  fast  access  and  understanding  to  anyone  who  wants  to know about this subject area.  People  tend  to  prefer  concise,  fact-based  content,  so  this  book  is built to deliver that punchy format.  Business  person,  politician  or  just  a  normal  member  of  the  public  perhaps one that has lost data , this book will raise your eyebrows and your knowledge in this fascinating and dangerous subject area   1.  Cybersecurity & Its Origins  We are living through the most significant period of change that has ever taken place in human history. It is the digital revolution.  If you could travel back in time just 30 years, you would be living in a world  where  if  all  the  computers  and  electronics  were  shut  off, everyone  and  everything,  including  the  products  and  services  we rely on, would be able to function and recover without catastrophe.  That is no longer true.  If someone were able to switch every digital and electronic device off today,  planes  would  drop  out  of  the  sky,  cars  would  stop  working, supermarkets  would  close,  large  companies  would  not  know  who worked for them and most banks would probably have no idea about who owed who what.  There is even a phenomenon that can switch off all these devices. It is called an electromagnetic pulse or EMP.  Any  electronic  device  exposed  to  an  EMP  has  every  single component  destroyed.  These  pulses  are  highly  unlikely  to  occur naturally but can be created artificially and have the formed the basis of some man-made weaponry. Apart from the military, nobody used to worry too much about the potential risk of an EMP.  They do now.  Most organizations are now rushing to regularly place a copy of their most  critical  data  in  an  EMP  pulse  proof  environment  known  as  a Faraday cage.  You might think that to a greater or lesser extent, you have opted out of an over-reliance on the digital age, but there is almost no service or product that you use that is not fully dependent on technology.   Hospitals, transport, shops, the electricity and water in your house, pretty  much  every  product  and  service  will  stop  working  if  the technology they now rely upon stops functioning.  You  are  almost  certainly  reliant  on  the  cyber  world  in  ways  that regularly, if not constantly, put your life in the hands of technology.  The rate of change we are experiencing is also not slowing down, it is accelerating.  Our  human  activities  and  our  behaviors  have  changed  more  in  the past 10 years than in any 10 year period in all of human history. To help  evidence  that  point,  at  several  presentations  I  attended,  the different speakers used this same example:  There is a set of 2 photographs of the selection of the Pope. In  the  first  photo,  taken  in  2005,  a  substantial  crowd  of  people are  standing  around  at  the  Vatican  City  watching  as  the  white smoke  appears  to  indicate  the  selection  of  a  new  Pope; Benedict. Move forward just 8 years for the next papal selection for Pope Francis  and  a  photo  is  taken  from  exactly  the  same  spot.  It  is 13th March 2013 and there are still similar numbers of people in the  crowd,  but  this  time  all  that  can  be  seen  is  a  sea  of illuminated  screens,  smart  phone  and  tablets  in  almost  every single person’s hand – periscope up, hands held high to capture the images.  In  2015,  if  you  take  a  look  around  you  at  any  coffee  shop,  train station, airport you will notice a lot of people engaging with some or other device, a smart phone, a tablet or a headset. And yet the very first  iPhone,   arguably  the  first  smart  device  to  catch  on  in  a  huge way  was only released in 2007.   In the UK, an Ofcom report in 2014 found that the average UK adult spent more time using media or devices than they do sleeping.        8  hours  41  minutes  per  day  using  any  type  of  digital device. 8 hours 21 minutes per day sleeping.  The simple truth is – if you can use digital devices effectively, they make  you  more  powerful.  They  can  make  you  richer,  save  you money,  boost  your  quality  of  life,  better  entertain  you  and  improve your social connections. Is  that  technology  100%  secure,  safe  and  reliable?  These  are  not questions  that  most  of  us  have  usually  bothered  to  contemplate unless or until we get hit by a problem.  As we mentioned in the introduction, the lure of lower costs, higher earnings  and  more  immediate  fun  encourages  us  all  to  adopt  new technologies very quickly. Do we understand the risks? Do we want to understand the risks? Do we know anybody who can actually tell us what the risks really are?  For  example  -  Did  you  ever  download  a  free  software  application? Did you ever consider that application was not free – the price was you? Or more accurately, access to the information on your phone, tablet or computer.  Perhaps you are feeling smug and have never downloaded such an app?  Well,  if  you  have  a  smart  phone  or  tablet,  the  chances  are almost  certain  that  the  device  manufacturer  or  service  provider already  loaded  a  few  on  and  mounted  those  permissions  into  your agreement with them.  Even  the  most  humble  game  or  flashlight  application  is  almost certain  to  be  taking  information  about  you,  your  location  and  your device  ID  –  and  probably  your  phone  number,  contacts  and  a  lot more.  Some  mainstream  applications  actually  have  permission  to   monitor your phone calls and emails  although whether they use the permission is still often a fuzzy area .  We live in an age where collecting information is power.  Organizations collect information to build their power. They want to learn  how  to  improve  their  products  and  services.  They  collect customer  information  to  better  target  their  customers  and  improve sales.  They  collect  competitor  data  to  understand  threats  and opportunities.  They  also  collect  to  other companies.  information   to  sell   But what happens when an unauthorized person or organization can get hold of someone else’s store of their most sensitive and valuable information?  Do you remember as a child the humiliation that a child would have to endure when some mean kid, or intrusive parent got hold of their diary.  Well,  let’s  magnify  that  to  a  corporate  scale.  We  saw  that  in December  2014  with  Sony  as  their  private  corporate  emails  were leaked. We will also look at the Sony breach as a case study later in the book.  It is tempting to think that cybersecurity is only about people trying to hack  and  steal  other  people’s  Indeed,  most cybersecurity  efforts  are  focused  on  protecting  digital  devices  and their information from the continual barrage of digital attacks that are attempted on them. Cybersecurity certainly includes that scope but it is also a much wider and more significant discipline.  information.   For example, in January 2015, the social media accounts of the US military Central Command  CENTCOM  were accessed by attackers claiming  allegiance  to  the  Islamic  State.  Their  intention  was  not  to steal  data  but  to  take  control  of  a  communication  channel  and manipulate  it.  The  motivation  was  not  financial  but  instead  had  the aim to create profile for their cause and unrest within their enemy.   A good place to start then is to precisely define what Cybersecurity is.  Cybersecurity  –  the  protection  of  digital  devices  and  their communication  channels  to  keep  them  stable,  dependable  and free  from  danger  or  threat.  Usually  the  required  protection  level must  be  sufficient  to  prevent  unauthorized  access  or  intervention that  can  lead  to  personal,  professional,  organizational,  financial and or political harm. digital device – any electronic appliance that can create, modify, archive, retrieve or transmit information in an electronic format.  During part of my research  early 2015 , it was a shock to discover that Wikipedia, the most extensive body of human knowledge in the universe,  has  not  yet  allowed  a  specific  entry  for  the  term ‘cybersecurity’ to be created – it just re-directs to ‘Computer Security’  Cybersecurity  is  about  protecting  a  lot  more  than  computers.  It  is more  than  protecting  all  technology.  Cybersecurity  is  really  about protecting  people  who,  directly  or  indirectly,  rely  on  anything electronic.  is  not  always  currently  accepted   It  that  cybersecurity  also encompasses  the  need  to  keep  a  device  stable  and  dependable. Most cybersecurity efforts are considered to focus on malicious and intentional threats to technology. However, it is a natural part of the definition of the word ‘security’ to consider wider threat factors. It is also my experience that systems can be taken out of action through incompetence more easily than through malicious attack.  The US National Security Agency  NSA  and their ‘Defense in Depth’ definition have helped expert audiences appreciate the wider threats, including  human  factors.  There  is  an  entire  chapter  dedicated  to human  factors.  The  NSA  issues  with  Edward  Snowden  highlighted   how  people  are  still  usually  the  weakest  link  in  the  cybersecurity chain.  defense  in  depth  –  the  use  of  multiple  layers  of  security techniques to help reduce the chance of a successful attack. The idea is that if one security technique fails or is bypassed, there are others  that  should  address  the  attack.  The  latest   and  correct  thinking on defense in depth is that security techniques must also consider  people  and  operations   for  example  processes   factors and not just technology.  I will provide more information about the need to include stability and dependability in Chapter 10. For now, it would be sufficient to identify that cybersecurity efforts are based on priorities.  Guarding  against  external  and  malicious  threats  is  considered  a priority  because  they  currently  appear  to  create  the  most  damage and cost. This is because most  but not all  cybersecurity incidents are due to criminal, state or terrorist sponsored activities.  A  malicious  attack  can  often  include  the  unauthorized  removal  or copying  of  information.  Leaks  of  information  often  cause  customer, brand  and  share  damage  in  addition  to  high  remediation  and compensation costs.  A system outage can also create these costs but they are usually at a different and lower scale.  So  how  has  it  happened  that  in  recent  years,  we  passed  our  lives into the hands of digital devices?  Until less than ten years ago, IT  technology  departments controlled what  devices  and  software  we  could  use  in  any  organization. ‘Technology’  was  typically  a  partially  effective  department,  with  a reputation  of  being  full  of  geeks  that  mandated  and  rolled  out   systems that were frequently  but not always  of little to no business value.  The  ability  of  the  average  technology  department  to  release something that was stable, secure and worked was for them often a higher  priority  than  understanding  the  actual  needs  of  the  people, business or organization it was intended for.  It  was  not  that  these  departments  didn’t  care.  It  was  just  that  they were often built that way.  tended   to  promote   Organizations  introvert  programmers  who struggled  with  social  interaction  into  project,  program  and  senior technology  managers.  We  then  put  them  in  contact  with  business units  who  had  only  limited  commercial  knowledge.  We  were  then surprised that they were terrible at communicating and kept building things for technical satisfaction rather than for the business purpose we dreamed about but perhaps could not describe.  We also allowed these departments to operate and deliver with the speed of a tazered snail in winter. I came into technology from a field where ‘I will get right on it meant that you would get something done in  the  next  few  minutes.  In  the  technology  area,  you  could  often struggle to get them to put an accurate year against a delivery date.  Whatever the failings of your internal IT department, they did tend to be very good at keeping the technology safe. After all, if it did mess up in a big way, their careers might be on the line.  One of the other major challenges for IT departments was this:        In large companies, nearly everything was custom made. We  would  ask  technology  departments  to  build  the software  from  a  clean  page,  often  based  on  very  limited business knowledge of what we needed. In  smaller  companies,  there  were  often  tasks  that  we could not afford the software for.   Then the cloud arrived.  cloud   the   –  An  umbrella  term  used  to  market  any  technology service that uses software and equipment not physically managed or  developed  by  your  organization.  A  ‘cloud’  service  can  involve any  technology  service;  the  difference  is  only  the  location  and management  of  the  equipment.  Usually  a  ‘cloud’  service  is indicated  by  an  ‘aaS’  suffix.  For  example –  SaaS   Software  as  a Service , IaaS  Infrastructure as a Service   The cloud opened up a market of software that offered choices and prices never seen before. Instead of paying thousands or millions for a  piece  of  software,  wait  months  or  years  for  it  to  arrive  and  then more  money  again  to  get  it  ‘hosted’   installed  on  computers   –  we could  pay  a  much  lower  cost   sometimes  even  free   and  try  out software within a matter of minutes.  This major change in thinking was largely popularized by Apple, their iPhone  and  their  App  Store.  The  App  Store  opened  the  eyes  of normal people what value they could get if they were willing to share a platform with other people.  It was soon apparent to company decision makers  often outside of the technology department  that if they applied a similar philosophy to  their  corporate  software,  they  could  get  more  choice,  greater flexibility  and  lower  costs,  especially  if  they  also  let  the  software producer host and manage updates to their products.  The digital revolution was coming of age.  Commercial  software   shrink  wrapped,  install  yourself   had  been around for decades. However, the time and cost to purchase and set the software up was usually a barrier to trying out a few.   The  ability  to  use  online  software  had  also  been  around  for  some time. For example, we have all been using search engines since the Internet  was  available.  Even  salesforce.com  started  as  early  as 1999. The big change took place as the adoption of ‘other peoples’ software that they often remotely serviced for you reached a tipping point. No company wanted to be left behind.  Early  adopters  of  the  cloud  were  able  to  immensely  outpace  their competition,  stripping  back  costs  and  more  importantly,  connecting more effectively with their customers.  The threatened risks of using this software failed to materialize early on  in  any  meaningful  way.  Most  people  found  that  using  ‘other peoples’  software  was  actually  a  lot  better  and  more  reliable experience.  Any person and any business could now find and choose software that  suited  their  real  needs,  download  it  and  try  it  in  a  matter  of minutes. In addition, the software itself was better than any in-house predecessor,  because  it  was  built  using  a  more  diverse  range  of business  expertise  than  had  ever  been  available  in  any  single company.  The cloud opportunities took most of the decisions over technology away  from  IT  departments  but  left  them  with  the  responsibility  to secure  it  after  the  decision  is  made.  The  decision-making  power  is with  us,  the  people.  When  it  comes  to  selecting  any  technology  or software  that  can  create  revenue  or  lower  operating  costs,  the technology department is now just a consultancy service.  Technology departments no longer dictate what software we will use, businesses tell the IT department what the technology departments need  to  integrate  and  support.  Businesses  have  to  make  the decisions  to  keep  pace  with  the  competition.  We  all  have  to  adopt new technologies that can drive up our product or service value.   That  has  profoundly  changed  the  role  and  skills  requirements  in technology  departments.  Any  that stopped  working  in  2009  and  came  back  to  the  field  today  would barely recognize the functions of the department.  information  security  person   The  hard  truth  is  that  the  technology  landscape  has  changed  so much in the past 10 years; a significant number of the people who work in the field don’t really understand current technologies. Even a good  technologist  who  keeps  up  to  date,  when  asked  a  specific question  about  a  totally  new  technology  will  need  to  go  away  and start researching and training themselves about it.   Whenever  I  make  this  point  in  any  conference  speech,  there  is  a nodding wave of agreement across my colleagues.   All  this  does  not  mean  that  the  role  of  technologists  in  any organization has reduced or diminished. In fact technology has gone from a peripheral department to being the critical foundation to each and every organization on the planet.  Cybersecurity  experts  who  sit  at  top  of  Government organizations  and  cyber  communities  confidently  predict  that  it  will become normal for a Chief Cybersecurity Officer  CCO  to be sat on all major organizations executive boards before the end of 2018.  the   The primary role of a modern ‘business technology’ department is to establish and manage how we can work smoothly and securely with a combination of in-house and external technologies. To do this, they have to establish a central architecture and work with each internal and external supplier to establish roles, responsibilities, boundaries, standards and other controls.  To put this more simply, it is very much like a set of scales. We saved money by choosing to use other peoples software but end up putting money back in to restore a level of security, stability and integration. When  that  investment  is  not  made,  potential  vulnerabilities  are   created. Those are the vulnerabilities that can become contributors or causes of cybersecurity breaches.  This is an example of how early conversations about securing new technologies would run:  Customer Group: We got this great new deal with a provider. They offered  to  analyze  a  copy  of  our  most  sensitive  information.  We would like to get some idea of how much it will cost to approve all of the security arrangements?  Tech Department:  After analysis  It will probably cost about £11,000 to check the security and as a ballpark, based on information already available,  perhaps  at  least  a  further  £30,000  to  put  the  additional security required into place.  Customer  Group:   Does  the  face   That’s  ridiculous;  we  are  only paying £2,000 for their service in the first year.  Tech Department: Yes, but you are placing a copy of data worth at least tens of millions of dollars with them…  and maybe the reason the price is so low is that they want access to your data, so they can use and resell it in some way…   The problem comes back to 3 basic items:  Information is valuable      Risks cost money to control   Until  an  organization  gets  hit  by  a  substantial  risk,  they are  tempted  to  save  money  by  being  as  minimalist  as possible on their controls.  Those  risks  are  not  just  from  external  suppliers.  Any  digital  device that  is  used  directly  or  indirectly  to  help  us  run  our  lives  and businesses are a potential point of vulnerability. In  the  cybersecurity  world,  any  potential  vulnerability  that  could  be leveraged is called an attack vector.   vulnerability –   in  the  context  of  cybersecurity   a  weakness  that could be compromised and result in damage or harm. vector  -  Another  word  for  ‘method’  -  as  in  ‘They  used  multiple vectors for the attack’  The more variety we have in what we allow in our selection of digital devices  and  the  software  that  sits  on  them,  the  more  potential vulnerabilities or vectors we have. Consider  mobile  email  as  an  example.  For  a  time,  Blackberry  was the  market  leading  choice  for  many  organizations  when  it  came  to mobile  email.  These  devices  would  be  directly  procured  and controlled by the company. As an employee entitled to mobile email, you potentially had 2 choices.  1  Have mobile email and a Blackberry or 2  Don’t  have  mobile  email  and  have  whatever  phone  you  like.  In that scenario, cybersecurity was easier. There was only one set of vectors to worry about. Now imagine the trend of ‘Bring Your Own Device’  BYOD  to work. This  is  a  concept  where  employees  can  purchase  any  phone  or tablet  from  anywhere  and  then  start  using  it  to  work  on  company items,  potentially  including  corporate  email.  How  do  you  make  that secure? If you have really large pockets, there are ways to mitigate this  danger  but  without  doubt  the  current  security  cost  starts  to exceed the value of the device and the convenience.  Regardless  of  the  potential  threats,  many  companies  do  allow employees  and  some  contractors  to  use  their  own  personal equipment inside their network and or to access privilege or sensitive information. It is no coincidence that the uptake of BYOD tends to be   higher  in  poorer  countries  with  more  relaxed  attitudes  towards  the safety of company information.  Organizations have never lived as dangerously as they do right now. Everybody  has  heard  of  ‘cutting  edge’  technology.  This  is  a  term used  to  describe  the  latest  and  most  desirable  new  items  to  use. Much  of  what  organizations  and  people  start  to  use  today  is ‘bleeding edge’ technology.  Bleeding Edge - Using inventions so new, they have the likelihood to  cause  damage  to  their  population  before  they  become  stable and safe.  BYOD is an example of bleeding edge technology usage.  In the battle to lower costs and raise earnings, the uptake of bleeding edge opportunities, even by major global companies has sometimes been astounding. In simple terms the immediate business value of a technology or device is often presented and decided on in isolation, without an accurate understanding of the wider security and stability risks to the organization.  For  example  –  the  business  case  benefit  for  BYOD  is  often presented  as  the  saving  of  the  device  cost  and  an  increase  in productivity of the employee. On the other side of the equation, there are  billions  of  combinations  of  free  applications  and  software  that can  be  loaded  on  to  people  s  personal  devices.  That  means  there are  more  vulnerability  combinations   vectors  again   than  can possibly be considered or mitigated.  BYOD will be stable and will work in a few years but we have yet to fully mature the controls and safety mechanisms at this point in time. For  every  expert  who  suggests  a  new  solution  to  secure  peoples own devices, I can still find 4 or 5 other experts who will find different   ways around the proposed protection. That is a clear indicator of a substantial and ongoing risk. It can also be argued that the risk from the vulnerability of a single mobile  device  is  too  small  to  be  a  concern.  After  all  what  can  get taken from a single device with a connection? What  we  have  above  is  an  example  of  a  risk  that  is  only  being looked at partially. These are the type of risks that can often come together   see  Chapter  10  on  ‘Stacked  Risks’   to  form  what  is commonly referred to as a major cybersecurity breach. Or as the UK ICO referred to their own loss in 2014 – a ‘non-trivial data breach’  Having  control  over  access  to  your  digital  devices  and  the information  they  store  and  transact  is  one  of  the  most  important factors in cybersecurity.  If  you  need  a  device  to  be  fully  secure,  it  really  is  as  simple  as considering  electronic  information  in  a  digital  device  to  be  no different than water in a container. You do not want the water to leak out; you only want to be able to pour it when you want. The same thing applies to any digital device, the more holes you  and others  punch  for  pouring,  the  more  likely  you  are  that  one  of  them  will spring a leak.  Just like plumbing, you also have to worry about access, leaks and weaknesses wherever you allow your information to flow. The more variety  and  options  in  your  cyber-plumbing,  the  harder  it  will  be  to keep it secure.  When  you  think  about  how  large  the  cyber-plumbing  for  a  large organization can be, you begin to understand how vast and difficult achieving and sustaining a secure environment can be. For that very reason,  organizations  often  now  have  different  ‘zones’,  with  the highest  level  of  security  operated  only  on  the  places  that  hold  and transact the most sensitive information.   Take for example, the flight control system of a modern plane. It is all run by computer but it is also designed to be completely enclosed. If you  use  a  device  on  a  plane  that  provides  an  internet  connection, that uses a completely different system from the flight controls. The only possible connection they share is using the planes power. Or at least that was what I thought until about a month ago.  I  am  a  private  pilot  myself,  so  was  interested  in  an  article  about  a patent  Boeing  applied  for  in  2003.  Something  they  call  the  Boeing Honeywell  Uninterruptable  Autopilot   BHUAP .  It  is  essentially  an anti-hijack  system.  Its  patent  is  on  public  record.  It  can  remove  all power  and  control  from  the  flight  deck,  with  the  aircraft  still  able  to continue to operate and fly.  In a situation where the plane detects a significant deviation from the expected flight parameters, the system can essentially shut the pilots out  from  any  control  of  the  plane  and  defer  to  either  a  pre- programmed emergency flight plan, or it can open an RF link through a  piece  of  standard  aircraft  equipment  called  a  ‘Mode  S Transponder’ to accept remote flight management.  Perhaps you think these systems are going to be installed sometime in  the  future?  Perhaps  it  is  in  place  already?  Maybe  you  think  that the people testing it will be able to consider every possible scenario and failsafe?  You should now have a very initial idea about what cybersecurity is and the reasons it has become so important.  Do you sleep soundly at night?  In  2015,  there  are  very  few  people  who  work  in  the  field  of cybersecurity that do.  That’s  because  we  know  most  organizations  and  individuals’ adoption  and  reliance  on  technology  substantially  outpaces  their general ability to keep it completely safe and secure.   Cybersecurity would not matter to you or to me if the damage from other people’s choices of technology were limited to only damaging them.  Growth and power opportunities have encouraged organizations and people, even those in critical product and service areas, to adopt and rely  on  an  ecosystem  of  digital  devices  that  are  often  only  partially under their control.  Each  time  there  is  a  brand  new  type  of  vulnerability  or  attack  type uncovered, you can often still smell the paint drying on the controls used to mitigate the problem.  control –  in the context of security and compliance  a method of regulating  something,  often  a  process  or  behavior,  to  achieve  a desired outcome.  Before we look more deeply into current cybersecurity concepts and practices, now would be a good point to look at what kinds of things occur to create a cybersecurity breach.  Keep  in  mind  that  cybersecurity  is  still  about  humans  attacking humans. The only difference with cybersecurity is that the weapons used to hurt us are our digital devices and the sensitive information they contain.  Let’s look at some case studies of real cybersecurity incidents.  Cyber  Insecurity:  Suffering  from  a  concern  that  weaknesses  in your cybersecurity are going to cause you personal or professional harm.   2.  About the Case Studies  In  the  next  chapter,  we  will  be  look  at  our  first  example  of  a cybersecurity  intrusion,  together  with  some  of  the  key  information that was made available about the event.  In each of the case studies, I have used a standard format to help make  the  incidents  easier  to  review  and  compare.  The  content  in each case study is based on information freely available in the public domain.  From  around  2007  until  2013,  the  risks  of  fast,  new  technology adoption were often deemed to be outweighed by the benefits and or earnings  they  returned.  Even  government  agencies  were  caught being complacent about their security posture.  A huge issue is just how much happens outside of any enterprises direct control but still inside their accountability. As we covered in the last chapter, the flow of information through and on to digital devices is similar to the flow of water through a plumbing system.  Whenever  I  had  to  audit  any  new  environment,  I  would  look  at  the flow of the information to identify what needed to be audited. Not just the  devices  and  their  paths;  also  the  human  processes  building, delivering, managing and using them.  In the race to outsource anything that was not considered absolutely core to each enterprise, information no longer remained in a closed and controlled environment.  An  analogy  would  be  that  as  enterprises  began  to  use  more  and more  suppliers,  they  essentially  started  attaching  their  plumbing system  to  a  lot  of  other  plumbing  systems  that  they  do  not  directly maintain and often have not checked.   Not  all  cybersecurity  risks  come  from  suppliers;  however  suppliers are  an  example  of  how,  when  looking  to  reduce  costs  or  increase earnings, we can be more inclined to introduce new potential risks.  Each unknown or unmitigated risk opens up vulnerabilities that can become targets for cybersecurity breaches.  As more and more enterprises started losing brand credibility due to very public failures of their technologies, everybody began taking the risks more seriously.  The  moment  that  really  changed  mainstream  corporate  board thinking  was  in  late  2013  when  Target   the  US  retailer   discovered that a copy of over 40 million customer details, including credit card numbers  had  been  stolen.  This  was  further  compounded  in  2014 when  Home  Depot   another  major  US  retailer   fell  victim  to  a  very similar event.  There  had  been  massive  data  breaches  before   and  since   this event,  however,  this  was  the  first  that  had  the  public  visibility, financial  scale  and  overall  corporate  damage  impact  that  had  long been warned about.  The moment that really transformed major governments’ investments was also in 2013, when a rogue contractor, called Edward Snowden, disclosed  thousands  of  classified  documents.  During  the  time Snowden procured these documents, he did not work directly for the NSA. He worked for a sub-contractor. We will look at that case study later on.  In our first case study, we will look at what happened at Target, the US retailer, in late 2013.  In each of these case studies, these organizations transparency over the root causes of their issues helps us to understand how problems arise and how to address them.   A  cybersecurity  representative  from  an  organization  that  has suffered a major and public breach is now likely to be more aware about cybersecurity risks and countermeasures than a counterpart in a company that has never been hit.  Organizations  hit  by  major,  public  breaches  are  far  less  prone  to attacks in the future, once they have assessed and addressed their vulnerabilities. Until 2014, most enterprises only invested reactively, only after they fell victim to one or more major events.  Although  the  largest  cybersecurity  incidents  get  the  most  publicity, there are literally tens of thousands of materially substantial events each day. Major enterprise networks are subject to literally millions of minor, opportunist, gap sensing events every hour.  The case studies in this book have been selected because they are globally, publicly visible and demonstrate a good mix of the potential causes  of  damage.  This  is  damage  that  arises  from  having unidentified  and or  unmitigated  risks.  Often  the  individual  root causes can look reasonably minor when looked at in isolation. Put a few together in a line and you have the power to severely damage an organization.  For Target, it was not just one thing that went wrong. In fact, in all the case  studies  we  will  look  at,  you  will  always  see  that  a  number  of what are referred to as ‘control failures’ combine together.  I  call  this  a  ‘stacked  control  failure’  as  a  result  of  unmitigated ‘stacked risk’ and have dedicated a chapter on it later in the book.  Before  we  look  at  the  Target  case  study,  to  understand  what happened, we need to define a few cybersecurity related terms:  hacker – a person who engages in attempts to gain unauthorized access to one or more digital devices.   cyber  attack  –  to  take  aggressive  or  hostile  action  using  or targeting  digital  devices.  Although  targeting  the  use  of  digital devices or their information as a weapon, the intended damage is not limited to the digital  electronic  environment.  Man-made devices do not attack each other through their own free will.  Behind  any  cyber  attack  there  are  people,  looking  to  take advantage of any gaps in our defenses. These people may or may not  be  hackers  themselves  but  will  certainly  engage  this  type  of expertise as part of their offensive.  The  primary  purpose  of  any  cyber  attack  is  about  achieving  a monetary and or political power advantage. The use of hackers and digital devices are only some of the weaponry used.  If or when somebody gets inside your digital devices, the disruption they  cause  and or  the  information  they  steal  are  only  secondary  to their end goal. The real objective is for the attacker to get money or achieve leverage through the destruction or theft.  For  example,  when  credit  card  data  is  stolen,  that  does  not  create instant  money  for  the  thieves   cyber  criminals   who  stole  it.  The information  has  to  be  sold  for  the  attack  to  be  profitable  to  the perpetrators. The theft is not the endgame, the resale and receipt of cash for the information is.  If someone breaks into your car and steals an item from inside, the cost of repairing the damage caused by the theft can often be much greater  than  the  value  of  the  item  stolen.  The  same  is  true  in  the cyber world. The attackers are only interested in their own profit and costs. The only time they will be interested in your costs is when they are  intentionally  aiming  to  create  high  costs  for  you  in  order  to perform some kind of ransom or extortion.   There  are  also  now  examples  of  physical  destruction  as  a  direct result  of  cyber  attacks.  For  example,  in  January  2015,  Wired reported on a cyber attack on a German steel mill that resulted in the inability to shut down the blast furnace and subsequent damage. http:  www.wired.com 2015 01 german-steel-mill-hack-destruction  The  tools  used  by  hackers  to  perform  cyber  attacks  include something called ‘malware’.  malware – shortened version of malicious software. A term used to  describe  the  insertion  of  disruptive,  subversive  or  hostile programs  onto  a  digital  device.  These  types  of  programs  can  be intentional  or  unintentional.  Intentional  versions  are  usually disguised  or  embedded  in  a  file  that  looks  harmless.  There  are many  types  of  malware;  Adware,  botnets,  computer  viruses, ransomware,  scareware,  spyware,  trojans  and  worms,  are  all examples  of  intentional  malware.  Hackers  often  use  malware  to mount cybersecurity attacks. botnet – shortened version of robotic network. A connected set of programs designed to operate together over a network  including the  internet   to  achieve  specific  purposes.  The  purpose  can  be good or bad. Some programs of this type are used to help support internet connections, malicious uses include taking over control of some or all of a computers functions to support large scale service attacks  see denial of service . Botnets are sometimes referred to as a zombie army. For  the  really  dedicated  -  definitions  of  the  other  bolded  terms above can be found at the back of the book.  However,  not  all  cybersecurity  issues  are  about  external  threats  or internal  technical  shortcomings.  Through  the  course  of  the  case   studies, it will be noticed that all cybersecurity breaches have a very strong human component.  Humans control all digital devices and the processes used to design, build, operate and fix them. Humans also ultimately design, build and operate all the malware used for attack.  There  is  one  final  term  that  we  need  to  define  before  we  look  at Target.  What  happens  when  a  known  or  suspected  breach  of cybersecurity is detected?  Whenever  a  known  or  suspected  cybersecurity  breach  of  any significance  takes  place,  a  largely  manual  process  known  as  an incident response should start.  incident  response  –a  prepared  set  of  processes  that  should  be triggered  when  any  known  or  suspected  event  takes  place  that could  cause  material  damage  to  an  organization.  The  typical stages  are   i   verify  the  event  is  real  and  identify  the  affected areas.   ii   Contain  the  problem   usually  by  isolating,  disabling  or disconnecting the affected pieces .  iii  Understand and eradicate the root cause.  iv  Restore the affected components in their fixed state.  v  Review how the process went to identify improvements to the process. An incident response may also be required to trigger other  response  procedures,  such  as  a  breach  notification procedure, if there any information has been lost that is subject to a notification requirement. For example – the loss of any personal information beyond what might be found in a phone book entry is usually considered a notifiable event. breach notification procedure –some types of information, when suspected  or  known  to  be  lost  or  stolen,  are  required  to  be reported  to  one  or  more  authorities  within  a  defined  time  period. The time period varies by regulator but is often within 24 hours. In addition  to  reporting  the  known  or  suspected  loss,  the  lead   organization responsible for the information  referred to as the data owner  is also required to swiftly notify those affected and later to submit a full root cause analysis and information about how they have  responded  and  fixed  the  issues.  To  meet  these  legal obligations,  larger  companies  usually  have  a  pre-defined  breach notification  procedure  to  ensure  that  the  timelines  are  met.  The fines for data breaches are usually increased or decreased based on  the  adequacy  of  the  organizations  breach  and  incident response management.  As  with  the  rest  of  this  book,  the  information  in  the  following  case studies is based entirely on information openly available in the public domain.  These  case  studies  are  intentionally  simplified  versions  of  the events.  The  purpose  is  to  understand  the  primary  events  and  their causes.  We  are  looking  to  understand  how  the  gaps  were  present rather  than  what  specific  software  and  version  were  used  at  each stage of the attack.   Breach Dates:  Date of Discovery:  Date of Disclosure:  Scale of the Breach:  Impact:     Summary:  3.  Case Study - Target 2013  Organization:  Target  US Retailer   November 27th – December 15th 2013  15th December 2014  18th December 2014  Nature of the Breach:  Loss of customer information including credit card numbers.  40 to 70 million customer records.  Estimated to cost Target at least $200m in costs, plus brand damage  and  a  resulting  decrease  in  short  term  revenues. CEO and CIO both lost their jobs.  A  heating,  ventilation  and  air-conditioning   HVAC   sub-contractor had  permissions  to  remotely  access  the  Target  network  for  the purposes of remotely monitoring their in-store HVAC systems.  A  copy  of  the  suppliers’  permission  credentials  were  stolen,  it  is believed this theft was achieved using a botnet  a type of malware  in this case used to scrape  steal  identity and password credentials.  The theft was not immediately detected. The  stolen  credentials  were  used  by  the  hackers  to  access  the Target network.   The network access available through the suppliers’ credentials was used  to  access  a  part  of  the  network   network  segment   where systems  with  access  to  Point  of  Sale  payment  systems  were present.  It was identified after the breach that Microsoft had published a case study,  available  on  the  internet,  about  the  Target  IT  infrastructure  source:  darkreading.com ,  including  naming  the  Microsoft  device management software that the company was using. It is not known if this was referenced as part of the attack. However, it is believed that this  device  management  software  was  used  to  distribute  another type  of  malware  on  certain  Point  of  Sale  devices  that  processed card payments.  This malware hid as an inconspicuous component where it recorded and  passed  credit  card  data  details  back  out  of  the  Target  network using files that were also disguised.  There  were  security  alerts  raised  on  a  recently  installed  FireEye malware detection system that Target had invested in. These alerts were in late November and were notified to Target headquarters. For some  reason,  no  immediate  action  was  taken  at  that  time.  This  is known in security circles as a failure to trigger an adequate incident response. The  hackers  were  able  to  retrieve  the  stolen  data  from  drop-off points outside the Target network.  The  drop-off  points  used  hijacked  servers  outside  of  the  Target network.  The stolen credit card details appeared for sale on the black market.  There  are  specialist  sites  that  exist  for  the  sale  of  stolen information.   Target  was  notified  about  the  breach  by  the  US  Department  of Justice on 15th December and began immediate corrective steps.   The  access  point  was  closed  the  same  day  and  the  public  were notified on December 18th once target had been able to assess the impact and confirm the problem had been addressed.  Root Causes:  There  are  literally  around  50  different  controls  across  this  chain  of events  that  failed  to  either  be  present  or  to  be  adequate.  Listing those controls is something I can do, however, for our purposes; we should focus on the primary root causes.  1. Everybody  expected  and  relied  upon  somebody  else’s controls to work if their own failed. This is a drawback of poorly  implemented  ‘defense  in  depth’  –  you  can  think that your own security layer or ‘piece’ is not vital enough to  be  a  point  of  significant  failure.  When  an  alarm  was raised, no effective response process was triggered.  2. The  security,  risk  and  budget  culture  was  asset  and  silo focused;  nobody  adequately  considered  the  big  enterprise   picture  of  how  all  those  ‘little’  risks  might  be stacked together to create this scale of problem.  See the chapter on ‘stacked risks’ later in the book.   3. The  security  controls  and  processes  that  were  present were  generally  set  to  meet  the  minimum  security  needs. Responses  to  new  threats  take  a  lot  of  time  to  become part  of  any  minimum  baseline  standards.  For  example, Target  had  passed  checks  against  the  Payment  Card Industry Data Security Standards  PCI DSS . Issues with any  standards  are  that  they  take  a  long  time  to  be updated  in  response  to  incidents  and  threats  and  they only  protect  against  well  known  and  highest  probability concerns.  These  factors  combined  together  to  create  a  security  posture  that contained a large number of potential vulnerabilities.   With credit to Target, they had implemented effective anti-Malware. If the alert reports from the anti-malware team had been responded to correctly, that could have prevented the breach.  Any one of about 50 different security controls might have stopped this breach, or substantially reduced the duration and scale. None of them did.  One vital item to note about each major cyber breach; the problem does not occur momentarily. Usually the breaches that happen today take place over a period of time. This is evidenced by the fact that most breaches are not reported as taking place on a specific date, at a  specific  time,  they  are  reported  to  have  occurred  in  a  particular month or across a number of months or even years. Target, Home Depot,  NSA   Edward  Snowden ,  Sony,  Microsoft  –  you  name  the breach and look at the duration and you will consistently find a span of time.  This  is  really  important  to  understand  correctly.  When  or  if  your cybersecurity gets breached, my experience is that it will always be true that:  1. Many defense controls  not just one  failed to be in place    or to be effective.  2. One or more people miscalculated the risks involved. 3. One or more people either did not respond quickly to an  alarm, or had no idea how to trigger the alarm process.  There is also often  but not always  a 4th category: If it was an organizations first, major cyber breach, then their senior management  team  may  misguidedly  fail  to  report  and  engage  the right countermeasures quickly. This is a terrible mistake and leads to even  greater  damage.  This  fourth  item  was  not  something  that happened at Target. As soon as the Target senior executives were informed, the incident was managed correctly.   exfiltrate –to move something with a degree of secrecy sufficient not  to  be  noticed.  Used  to  describe  moving  stolen  data  through detection systems.   4.  The Disciplines within Cybersecurity As groundwork for our next case study, now is a good time to look at the disciplines within cybersecurity.  If you want to design, build and fit a large new house and you want to do it well, the chances are that you will need to use a set of people with  a  range  of  different  skills.  You  are  more  likely  to  get  the  best house if you use a blend of the right professionals.  For example, an architect can design you a great house but would offer  truly  terrible  value  for  money  if  you  put  them  to  work  on  a construction site as a builder.  Similarly,  if  you  let  an  electrician  design  your  house,  the  finished product might not end up so well.  Cybersecurity is an even more complex discipline than constructing buildings.  It  is  also  a  much  newer  subject  area  and  evolving  at  a much faster rate than any other.  With buildings, at least we have the collective experience of creating them for thousands of years.  In the world of cybersecurity, being up to date on last year’s issues can  still  mean  your  knowledge  is  out  of  date.  Can  you  imagine  if construction methods changed that fast?  The  speed  of  change  is  a  real  issue.  Years  ago,  adults  were expected to know more about life than children. In many households, when it comes to technology, that relationship is reversed. In many households, a child runs the technology because they are better able to understand and keep up with the changes than their parents.  General intelligence is measured on a scale called IQ or Intelligence Quotient. Intelligence about technology is beginning to be recorded   on something called a DQ or Digital Quotient.  You can find tests to measure your DQ online.  intelligence   A  study  of  digital  in  2014  by  Ofcom   the  UK communications regulator  found that the average, middle aged adult scored about 96 on the DQ tests. The average six year old scored 98.  They  may  still  be  learning  right  from  left,  but  the  average  child  is likely to know more about technology than the average adult.  This  speed  of  change  is  part  of  what  drives  the  need  for cybersecurity  to  be  treated  as  a  discipline.  It  is  a  complex  subject area, subject to continuous change that requires a blend of different skills.  You would not expect to go into a hospital and see just one person who could do everything. Surgeon, hospital administrator, nurse and cleaner are very different roles but all vital to a full function hospital. Even  within  the  field  of  surgery,  it  is  unlikely  that  a  heart  surgeon would know the first thing about brain surgery.  The same thing is true within cybersecurity.  There  are  still  many  organizations  who  expect  to  be  able  to  recruit one person to cover all the cybersecurity functions. My advice is to avoid  these  positions.  Those  who  try  them  usually  suffer  from  high levels of stress followed by near certain failure.  With something like construction, it might be possible for one person to achieve a blend of skills over many years that would allow them to build a good house.  With  cybersecurity,  the  information  and  skills  are  changing  and updating  so  quickly,  it  is  a  challenge  to  stay  on  top  of  the  latest information for a single role.   For example, although I have an appreciation of all the roles that can be relevant to cybersecurity and have worked in some of them, my up to date knowledge is as a cybersecurity manager. If I went back to  a  different  role,  I  would  need  to  trained  and  brought  up  to  date with what to do.  If I had left a cybersecurity role more than 5 years ago, it is likely that my previous knowledge would be so out of date; it might actually be a disadvantage.  So what are the main functions and roles within cybersecurity?  Organizations are still deciding what cybersecurity is and what roles a  cybersecurity  department  should  contain.  It  would  be  possible  to list over 30 different roles in this section, but for clarity, we will look at some  of  the  main  functions  that  would  need  to  exist  in  the cybersecurity team of any major enterprise. In  this  chapter,  cybersecurity  functions  are  in  bold  text.  Any  roles that can sit within a function are shown in underlined text. There are six  main  groups  of  cybersecurity  tasks  and  skills  to  consider,  with examples of roles underneath:  1  Management Chief Cybersecurity Officer Cyber Risk Manager Cybersecurity Architect 2  Cyber Audit & Assessment Audit Manager, Auditor, Assessment Specialist, ... 3  Event Monitoring and Alerts Security Incident & Events Management Security Incident Responder Cybersecurity and Network Intrusion Analysts Security Engineers 4  Operations Security Administrators   Firewall and Network Device Administrators Encryption   Cryptography Consultant Security Risk Consultants Cybersecurity Analysts 5  Environment Testing Attack & Penetrations Testers Vulnerability Assessors 6  Specialists Security Controls Designer External Security Specialist Digital Forensics Cryptologist Cryptanalyst Anti-Malware   Anti-Virus Specialist Software Security Specialist  Management: A long standing question is: What exactly is management supposed to do?  The simple answer is that they are responsible and accountable for putting the correct governance in place.  governance  –  the  methods  used  by  any  executive  to  keep  their organization  on  track  to  the  management  goals  and  within acceptable  performance  standards.  This  is  usually  achieved  by establishing policies and procedures  that  match  the  enterprises vision, strategy and risk appetite.  Head of Cybersecurity   Chief Cybersecurity Officer  A key principle within any management structure is to have a single point of accountability at the top.   In  2015  it  is  almost  unheard  of  for  a  Chief  Cybersecurity  Officer  to exist on the board of any organization. Within a few years, it will be rare for any organization not to have one.  The  Chief  Cybersecurity  Officer   CCO   has  an  executive  strategic focus and board level responsibility for setting digital strategies, their governance  and  their  consequences.  A  digital  failure  can  see  the end  of  a  board,  so  this  person  must  sit  on  and  have  the  full confidence of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer.  A  successful  CCO  will  need  to  be  a  business  person  first,  with excellent  political  and  communication  skills,  together  with  a  broad understanding  of  cybersecurity  governance   how  to  manage  the digital landscape , a continual eye on emerging technologies and a keen  sense  of  risk  and  how  to  keep  risk  managed.  They  will  also need to be excellent at pulling together a strong management team beneath them.  All  matters  relating  to  the  choice  and  use  of  technology  will  report into a hierarchy that reports to the Chief Cybersecurity Officer. This must  include  final  accountability  for  all  governance  items,  including policies and procedures.  policies – high level statements of intent, often short documents, providing  guidance  on  the  principles  an  organization  follows.  For example,  a  basic  security  policy  document  could  describe  the intention  for  an  enterprise  to  ensure  all  locations   physical  and electronic   where  information  they  are  accountable  for,  must remain  secure  from  any  unauthorized  access.  A  policy  does  not usually describe the explicit mechanisms that would be used, only or enforce the intentions it expresses.  procedure  –  provides  guidance  or  specific  instruction  on  the process   method   that  should  be  used  to  achieve  an  objective.   Traditionally  provided  as  a  document  available  to  appropriate personnel,  but  in computer systems.  increasingly  replaced  by  enforcing  steps   The Chief Cybersecurity Officer defines the security and risk culture for  their  entire  organization,  with  ultimate  accountability  for  all cybersecurity  related  policies  and  procedures.  This  role  will  be accountable for ensuring the right control structures are in place to keep risk within acceptable levels at the same time as providing as much  flexibility  as  possible  for  the  safe  use  of  new  and  emerging technologies.  The role of the Chief Information Security Officer  CISO  may also be incorporated  into  the  Chief  Cybersecurity  Officer  role  or  remain separate, depending on the size of the company.  A good way to think simply about a Chief Cybersecurity Officer is to consider  that  he  or  she  is  to  technology,  what  the  Chief  Financial Officer is to the company money. Full control and accountability, with external diligence checks taking place occasionally.  Cyber Risk Manager  Directly  under  the  Chief  Cybersecurity  Officer   or  in  smaller organizations,  as  part  of  the  CCO  role   somebody  needs  to  be responsible for collecting and monitoring the cumulative set of open risks across the digital landscape.  risk  –  a  situation  involving  exposing  to  danger.  In  formal frameworks,  risk  can  be  quantified  using  probability   often expressed  as  a  percentage   and  impact   often  expressed  as  a financial amount .   The  manager  of  cyber  risk  will  usually  establish  ‘materiality’  levels  potential probability and impact thresholds  for items to be escalated into them.  Effective  cyber  risk  management  requires  recording  additional information  about  the  digital  components  and  business  processes that can be impacted. This is vital to ensure the cumulative risks can be viewed across business processes and across assets as well as by individual risk.  It is critical to note that most cybersecurity breaches occur because of cumulative risks.  See chapter on stacked risks.   Cybersecurity Architect  There is a saying from the last century. ‘Fail to plan. Plan to fail.’  Although  you  may  be  using  technology  choices  from  far  and  wide, unless you want the expense and risk of reinventing the wheel with each  choice,  you  need  a  security  architecture  and  that  requires  a cybersecurity architect.  Rather  than  spending  time  designing  security  features  after  a technology has been selected, a security architect creates a master plan with standard security components that can be used effectively and quickly each time a new technology needs to be added.  A  cybersecurity  architects’  role  is  to  ensure  that  there  is  a  clear understanding  of  the  permitted  methods  to  securely  integrate  and extend  your  organizations  digital  ecosystems  with  others.  Even  the security  of  individual  mobile  applications  in  any  device  they  could exist in will be considered.  For  example,  using  a  large  number  of  passwords  is  really  not  very secure at all. A security architect can design a framework where a lot of different internal and external technologies can be accessed using   exactly  the  same  identity  and  password,  without  ever  exposing  the password itself to any other software.  The  architect  can  design  secure,  standard  options  for  the  flow  of information  between  devices.  Whenever  a  new  method  of information flow is requested, it can be the security architect who has to be involved in reviewing, approving or escalating the issue. Cyber Audit & Assessment It  is  essential  to  crosscheck  the  security  and  integrity  of  all  key technologies, suppliers and processes on a regular basis.  The cyber audit and assurance function exists to check samples of operations to check they are being performed securely and correctly.  Audits and assurance are performed based on the key controls that appear  in  the  policies  and  procedures,  set  by  the  company management. The policies and procedures will normally be aligned to meet any legal requirements or industry standards.  Continuous  tracking  and  reporting  on  the  activities  of  security administrators can also form part of this function.  Any  significant  control  gaps  identified  must  be  tracked  through  to closure.  Any  immediate  critical  risk  items  must  be  escalated  up  to the cyber risk register or directly to the CCO as appropriate. Event Monitoring & Alerts: Digital landscapes are under constant attack. This means that large organizations  need  technologies  and  people  to  continually  monitor the  real-time  information  and  alerts  about  attempted  intrusions  into the network.  Security Incident and Event Management  You  need  skilled  people  ready  and  able  to  respond  to  any cybersecurity problem. Remember Target and what failed to happen   when  their  anti-malware  raised  an  alert?  This  is  the  function  that should have responded.  People within this function  in smaller organizations  may have other roles  and  could  be  called  upon  to  join  an  incident  response  team, however, fast incident response, including corrective measures and root cause analysis require so much knowledge and skill that you are unlikely to have these people free when you need them, if they are not already assigned to this function.  Usually,  there  will  be  a  Security  Incident  Responder  on  call  at  all times  to  ensure  an  immediate  response  to  any  event  such  as  a denial of service  DoS  attack.  Denial  of  service   DoS   –  an  attack  designed  to  stop  or  disrupt people from using your systems. Usually a particular section of you enterprise  is  targeted,  for  example,  a  specific  network,  system, digital device type or function. Usually these attacks originate from and are targeted at devices accessible through the internet. If the attack  is  from  multiple  source  locations,  it  is  referred  to  as  a distributed denial of service or DDoS.  Cybersecurity & Network Intrusion Analysts  Measure,  monitor  and  manage  the  operational  status  of  all  assets and  information  flows  that  are  directly  under  the  control  or accountability  of  includes  all  software, hardware, network devices, communication channels and third party  external   landscape  items  that  can  be  a  potential  source  of vulnerabilities.  the  organization.  This   This  is  usually  coordinated  through  a  combination  of  device  and network monitoring software, together with other investigative tools. These  pieces  of  information  are  usually  collected  together  to  form   status  dashboards  and  automated  alerts  that  operate  around  the clock.  The  specification  for  the  level  of  control  are  set  by  the  policies, procedures and baseline standards put in place by the cybersecurity management team, including the CCO and Cybersecurity architect.  Any operational gaps or deficiencies are also resolved by this team. Any  significant  gaps  or  deficiencies  in  policies  and  procedures  are reported  together  with recommendations to initiate improvements.  the  cyber  assurance   function,   to   Any  major  incident  must  immediately  trigger  the  incident  response procedure. The analysts from this team are usually also part of the incident response team, under the direction of the Security Incident and Event Management function.  Members of this team are valuable consulting assets for the creation of  new  security  solutions  and  the  hardening  of  existing  security standards.  Security Engineers  To perform security monitoring, including the analysis of logs to help detect  and  report  incidents.  To  assess  damage  and  impact  should any incident take place. Operations Operations maintain day-to-day business functions that are critical to sustaining an effective and secure digital landscape.  Security Administrators  Set up and manage access to organization wide security systems. It is usual to monitor administrators closely, prohibit operational use of the system by the administrator, specifically, if a person configures or administers access, they should not also have permission to perform the software function. Security administration roles should be rotated    changed   periodically  and  changes  on  high  sensitivity  systems should  require  at  least  2  people  to  process   a  proposer  and  an approver .  Firewall & Network Device Administrators  To configure and maintain the digital gateways and corridors.  Intrusion Detection & Prevention Specialists  To configure, monitor and maintain specialist software and hardware used  on  network  communication  channels  to  detect  or  prevent intrusions from taking place.  Encryption   Cryptography Specialist  Act as an advisor on safe key management processes and advises on appropriate encryption   cryptography standards.  Security Risk Consultant  Whenever  a  new  type  of  technology,  device  or  communication channel is being considered, it is advisable to assess the risk. This is usually achieved by a process that covers items we will look into in more  detail  in  later  chapters.  This  role  advises  on  the  security  risk process design and provides consultative assistance to the business during this process. Environment Testing: To  help  sustain  a  secure  digital  landscape,  there  are  certain additional tests carried out. Penetration Testers  also sometimes referred to as ethical hackers  –  To perform checks and scans for potential exploits across any new system  or  website,  before  it  is  put  in  to  use  and  on  a  periodic  repeating   basis  defined  by  the  organizations  procedures  and security posture. Any exploits  vulnerabilities  discovered are usually   assigned  a  criticality  level  and  resolved  if  their  criticality  level  is higher than the organizations acceptable standard.  Penetration  tests  are  almost  always  performed  on  a  copy  of  a  live system  and  not  on  the  live  system  itself.  This  is  to  prevent  any inadvertent operational disruption.  Vulnerability Assessors  These people use software to perform less aggressive  passive  but wider  and  usually  more  frequent  series  of  checks  on  systems  and networks.  These  checks  are  usually  on  live  and  operational environments  and  are  intentionally  passive   non-aggressive   to prevent inadvertent operational disruption. Other Roles: This  is  not  a  full  and  exhaustive  list.  These  further  roles  are  just examples of other, more specialist roles that can also be important to a cybersecurity team, depending on their size and purpose.  Security Controls Designer  A  person  who  can  support  the  cybersecurity  area  by  analyzing  the exact  requirements   purpose  and  intention   for  any  new  security control and propose the most efficient, effective and least disruptive design.  External Security Specialists  Can be very useful to help advise, augment or educate the internal cybersecurity  team  on  any  matters  or  subject  area  they  are  not familiar  with  or  have  insufficient  time  allocation  for.  External specialists can also be useful for temporary or part-time roles. The main criterion is to verify first that they do actually have the missing skills that you require. You would be surprised by how many do not.  Digital Forensics   Following  any  legal  issue  with  a  cybersecurity  incident,  a  Digital Forensic specialist is able to preserve, rebuild and recover electronic information. This role is usually a key part of any law enforcement or legal action involving the use of digital devices.  Anti-Malware   Anti-Virus Specialists  Help to analyze, counteract, report and defend against new types of malicious  software.  These  specialists  are  particularly  useful  during zero-day attacks.  zero-day – refers to the very first time a new type of exploit or new piece of malware is discovered. At that point in time, none of the anti-virus, anti-malware or other defenses may be set-up to defend against the new form of exploit. Software Security Specialist – ensures that software is ‘secure by design’  by  incorporating  security  features  into  both  the  build process  and  the  features  specification.  Other  duties  can  include running  automated  and  manual  scans  through  the  program  itself  known  as  the  source  code   to  guard  against  any  backdoor  or other unfriendly insertions by programmers. backdoor  –an  unofficial  method  to  access  software  or  a  device that bypasses the normal authentication requirements.  Cryptologist  Performs   Encryption code-maker .  research   Cryptanalyst  to  create  stronger  encryption  algorithms.  Analyzes  encrypted  the information. Essentially, this role is an encryption code-breaker. This  to  decrypt  and   information   reveal    can  be  especially  useful  in  anti-malware  companies  because  any new malware itself is usually encrypted.  These  were  only  high  level  description  of  the  main  functions  and roles that can be required within the cybersecurity team of any major enterprise.  Keep in mind that people are sometimes required to cover a number of these roles and often a job title may have little resemblance to the tasks and duties.  Two  areas  only  partially  covered  above  but  becoming  increasingly important are:    How  to  put  together  teams  across  these  disciplines  that can  try  and  pre-empt  where  the  next  exploit  can  come from.    Ensuring  that  the  correct  contingency  and  restoration plans are ready to go, in the event of a disaster  technical or natural  taking place.  Contingency  plans  are  usually  known  as  Business  Continuity Plans.  Business  Continuity  Plan  –  an  operational  document  that describes how an organization can restore their critical products or services to their customers should a substantial event that causes disruption to normal operations occur.  Business continuity plans are an entire subject and discipline in their own  right.  A  single  organization  can  often  have  multiple  business continuity plans to ensure each location, product and service can be individually restored.  Technologies  are  often  used  across  multiple  sites,  products  and services. For this reason, the restoration of a digital system is only   referenced by a business continuity plan and not contained within it.  The  restoration  plan  for  a  digital  or  electronic  system  is  known  as either  a  Technical  Disaster  Recovery  Plan  or  simply,  a  Disaster Recovery Plan.  Technical Disaster Recovery Plan – an operational document that describes  the  exact  process,  people,  information  and  assets required to put any electronic or digital system back in place within a  timeline  defined  by  the  business  continuity  plan.  If  there  are multiple  business  continuity  plans  that  reference  the  same technical disaster recovery plan, the restoration time used must meet the shortest time specified in any of the documents.  Although  these  disciplines  already  exist  separately,  they  are  an example  of  in  organizations  where cybersecurity must be represented, considered and embedded.  that  exist   further   roles   You  might  not  think  that  natural  disasters  and  technical  resilience need  to  consider  each  other.  Think  of  Fukushima.  Think  how  a hacker  thinks.  If  you  want  to  take  out  a  digital  system,  brute  force can  often  be  more  effective  than  technical  prowess.  It  is  good  to think  about  all  the  little  things  but  don’t  forget  the  items  that  can potentially wipe you out.  A good piece of advice I heard from the Head of Cybersecurity for the Department of Homeland Security was this:  If  you  want  a  strong  team  that  can  help  you  stay  ahead  of cybersecurity  issues,  it  is  wise  to  make  sure  your  team  is  EGGE. That  means  that  if  you  are  looking  for  a  strong  team  to  run  an enterprises  cybersecurity  you  should  put  together  asset  of  people that are:    Ethnically diverse     Geographically diverse   Gender diverse   Educationally diverse  These are very wise words indeed. You cannot hope to identify the potential weaknesses your opposition might find if you have a group of people who have a smaller inventory of knowledge.   5.  Case Study – Edward Snowden 2013 Organization s :  Hawaii NSA Regional Operations Center  Breach Dates:  Unknown  March 2013?  until June 2013  June 2013  June 2013  Date of Discovery:  Date of Disclosure:  Nature of the Breach:  Scale of the Breach:  Impact:     Summary:  Australian, British and American classified documents.  250,000 to 2 million documents.  Political  instability  and  trade  relations  damage.  Direct personal  danger  to  service  personnel  named  in  some documents.  There is plenty written on the subject of Edward Snowden. Here we will  only  focus  on  the  facts  that  help  us  to  understand  what happened to allow such a huge cybersecurity breach.  There are 3 potential sources of information about what happened:     Information from the US National Security Agency and US Government    Edward Snowden himself   Speculators  We  need  to  stay  based  in  fact,  so  we  will  focus  on  items  that  are consistent across the first 2 sources above and leave speculation out of the equation.   Edward  Snowden  joined  a  company  called  Booz  Allen  in  March 2013.  Booz  Allen  was  one  of  several  companies  who  performed contract work for the US National Security Agency.  Pre-screening  at  any  US  agency   including  Booz  Allen   for  people that have access to any system or systems that can access sensitive government information would have been very strict.  Assessment of Edward Snowden through these methods would have indicated that Edward Snowden was a reasonably reliable and safe person for this kind of role:    He  had  already  worked  with  privileged  access  government systems for many years without any issue.  to  ο Snowden worked directly for the US Central Intelligence Agency between 2006 and 2009, where he proved to be extremely good at computer network security.  ο He had then joined Dell, working on NSA contracts and eventually,  allegedly  advising  on  strategies  to  protect their networks from attack.    His family had a strong history of government and military  service.  Snowden himself had not previously demonstrated any behavior that had  triggered  any  reported  concern  about  his  ethics,  personality  or outlook. At least, if there were ever any signs, they had not resulted in  revoking  his  previous  security  status  and  were  not  available  to Booz Allen. He had joined Booz Allen for a pay decrease.  Whatever  the  reasons  that  Snowden  provided  to  Booz  Allen  for accepting  a  lower  paid  role,  they  were  plausible  enough  to  pass through the screening processes.  Snowden himself identifies 3 key events that changed his outlook.   1  The  personal  discomfort  he  felt  when  he  discovered  the amount  of  personal  data  the  US  and  UK  governments were  collecting  and  reviewing  about  their  own  private citizens.  2  The  absence  of  sufficient  governance  mechanisms  to secure  the  environments  and  report  any  misuse  of information at all government levels.  3  In  March  2013,  he  describes  reaching  a  breaking  point when he watched a top US official in the security service ‘directly lie to Congress under oath.’  The  exact  tasks  and  duties  that  Edward  Snowden  was  responsible for  are  unclear  and  vary  in  different  accounts.  It  is  unlikely  that  he had the range of access and responsibility he sometimes describes himself.  All  parties  do  however  confirm  that  he  did  have  certain security administration privileges and that this was his primary role. A  further  certainty  is  that  Edward  Snowden  knew  his  subject  area  network security  extremely well.  With  years  of  insider  knowledge,  together  with  a  small  amount  of privileged access and a disaffected outlook he had a combination of motive,  capability  and  opportunity  the organizations cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  internally  exploit   to   To  safeguard  operations,  it  is  a  usual  control  to  monitor  system administrators  closely  and  to  prohibit  them  from  also  having operational  access  to  the  information  in  the  same  system.  For example,  if  you  were  a  person  that  administers  peoples’  access  to their  bank  accounts,  it  would  be  a  normal  control  for  you  to  be prohibited  from  ever  having  or  granting  yourself  permission  to access those same accounts and the information they contain.  In high security systems, it is usual to have audit trails sufficient to record,  trace,  prevent  and  alert  suspicious  access.  However, recording  who  has  ever  accessed  what  piece  of  intelligence  is  a   double-edged  sword.  Even  top  officials  might  need  to  occasionally access something without leaving a record of that access.  There were some audit trails and logs in place, however, they were either able to be bypassed or did not raise any immediate, significant alerts.  It is also usual in high security environments to very closely monitor anybody  with  privileged  access.  Edward  Snowden  had  a  privileged access  that  was  low  enough  for  him  to  be  trusted  to  work independently but high enough to leverage to get into other systems and devices. This is evident from the extremely large number of files he was able to extract without being noticed.  The  final  extraction  point  of  the  files  was  through  the  use  of  a  few USB  thumb  drives.  These  were  able  to  be  physically  taken  in  and out of the facility.  USB  –  abbreviation  for  Universal  Serial  Bus.  A  small,  standard connection  port  available  on  most  digital  devices   computers, smart  phones,  ...   to  allow  the  attachment  of  other  devices including  keyboards,  mice  and  storage  devices.  This  port  is  the subject  of  many  vulnerability  attacks  when  physical  access  to devices inside an internal network is possible. Attaching something to this port inside a network can bypass several layers of network security.  Software  to  block  or  alert  attacks  through  this  port  type are often able to be bypassed.  The  exact  amount  of  information  that  Edward  Snowden  stole remains  unknown.  Between  the  US  government  and  Snowden himself,  estimates  range  from  around  250,000  to  1.7  million documents.  Root Cause Analysis:   There is no single root cause to this breach. It is again true that there are a number of standard security controls that were not in place that provided the opportunity for the cybersecurity breach.  Reviewing  the  available  information,  the  primary  causes  can  be considered to be:    There  was  insufficient  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  administrator activities.  US  government  departments  began  to  stipulate  ‘Mandatory vacations’  for  security  administrators  after  the  event.  This  is an indication that the rogue activities would likely have been discovered even if Snowden had been rotated out of his role for a few days.   Toxic accumulation of domain knowledge. The level of domain specific, accumulated security knowledge that Snowden obtained was too high for any single individual to have. This meant that he knew exactly how and where he could get to without fear of immediate detection. It was not his knowledge of security that was the issue; it was his ability to know  where  the  specific  gaps  were.  As  with  all  ‘secret’ information, it needs to be broken into pieces and never made available to the same person.   Toxic accumulation of privileges. This  is  a  term  often  used  by  banks.  As  someone  moves through  an  organization,  their  permissions  are  often, accidentally  left  in  place.  Over  a  period  of  years,  this  can allow  a  person  to  operate  across  the  systems  in  a  way  that each department may never have considered.   The  rules  on  only  assigning  ‘Least  Privilege’  were  not  applied.  When  any  person  is  given  access  permission  to  anything,  it should be on the basis of the minimum rights they require to do  what  they  need  to  do.  For  some  roles,  especially   administrators  and  programmers,  it  can  be  tempting  but inadvisable  to  provide  full  access  as  this  decreases  security administration  security vulnerabilities.    Incorrect or inadequate classification of some assets and information.  overheads   increases   but   Somewhere there is often a detailed map of your full network, or  a  full  security  plan,  complete  with  information  on  every layer  of  security  present.  That  can  act  just  like  a  building blueprint  for  identifying  the  weakest  and  most  vulnerable points  of  entry.  Maybe  there  is  a  network  device  that  is  the gateway  to  your  most  classified  and  confidential  information. Often  information  like  this  is  maintained  with  much  lower security than the information they protect. For example, I have frequently  been  given  security  and  network  plans  like  this during  an  external  audit.  Although  these  document  are designed  to  evidence  a  strong  security  posture,  granting access  to  this  document,  even  having  it  all  in  one  place  is evidence to the contrary.   Just like Target, a number of security controls were missing. This time part of the reason  as stated by Edward Snowden  was that nobody regularly and accurately checked  audited  to understand  if  the  right  controls  were  in  place.  Snowden  was not  the  only  person  that  knew  this  and  many  others  with insider knowledge made similar comments after the incident. Secret  environments  are  often,  intentionally  unaccountable. The degree of unaccountability allowed it to escape audit and for a substantial number of security gaps to persist.   Certain  privilege  functions  should  require  2  people  to  Inadequate system and process auditing.  operate and did not.    Physical security was complacent and based on trust.   Employees  and  contractors  knew  that  being  searched  for devices  like  a  small  USB  storage  device  was  unlikely.  It  is likely  that  there  were  no  random  searches  and  that  ‘known’ people came and went as they liked.  that   is  clear   the  National  Security  Agency  believes   the It  improvement of pre-screening processes should be an area of focus. If they could have identified the intent of Edward Snowden from the start, then that would make not looking at other cybersecurity gaps easier to tolerate.  However, it is doubtful that pre-screening alone could have detected any issues.  Snowden  had  a  track  record  of  years  of  reliable  service  and experience  passing  pre-screening  checks.  It  is  wishful  thinking  to believe  screening  could  have  been  an  easy  point  to  prevent  the breach. In the case of Edward Snowden, the only potential indicator of a hidden motive was the drop in pay he was willing to take.  Improved  screening  of  employees  and  contractors  with  potentially subversive motives is still a good idea. There is a lot of ongoing work on how personality profiling can help. This is for a very valid reason. People  are  always  the  weakest  link  in  the  cybersecurity  defense chain.  For  that  reason,  we  dedicate  an  entire  chapter  to  human factors later in the book.  We should also remember that Edward Snowden did not work for the NSA. He worked for a contractor. What does that mean? Whenever there is a commercial  supplier  relationship, there is required to be a more  finite,  financial  limit  to  operations.  Suppliers  do  exactly  what the customer asks for and if they are clever, they do nothing extra. To do extra things for free erodes margins.  That  is  not  to  say  that  Booz  Allen  did  anything  wrong.  It  is  just making the general comment that any commercially astute supplier   will only do what they are specifically paid to and no more.  In  my  own  years  of  auditing  suppliers,  they  are  often  good  at highlighting and recommending fixes to security gaps. However, as closing those gaps normally has a price attached, the customer often makes a decision to live with the gap.  Edward Snowden was an insider who gained a toxic combination of too much inside knowledge, too much unsupervised privilege, dislike of  his  own  life  path  and  intense  dissatisfaction  on  some  of  the actions of some of those in power.  He  knew  more  about  the  security  vulnerabilities  than  the  people trying to keep it secure. The bottom line was that there were a lot of open security vulnerabilities in place.  So was Edward Snowden a whistleblower or a traitor?  That  is  not  for  us  to  determine.  It  is  relevant  though  to  look  at  few further facts.  Edward  Snowden  did  alert  the  public  to  the  scale  that  some governments were using to monitor their systems. He also identified the presence of authorized backdoors that many of the major social media  technologies  had  provided  for  use  by  government  agencies. These  agencies  find  these  useful  as  they  bypass  the  need  to  put large amounts of resources on breaking the encryption layer.  encryption – the act of encoding messages so that if intercepted by an unauthorized party, they cannot be read unless the encoding mechanism can be deciphered.  Conversely, any cybersecurity expert will know that backdoors are a bad  idea  because  the  vulnerabilities  they  create  are  useful  to attackers  and  usually  far  outweigh  the  benefits.  For  example, imagine  if  a  bank  had  16  security  layers  on  the  main  entrance  for   customers and a single door at the back for staff. Which entry point would you attack?  Based  on  these  items,  it  can  be  argued  that  there  was  a  level  of public  interest  that  was  served  by  Edward  Snowdens  activities. However,  it  could  be  reasonable  to  expect  a  whistleblower  to  only reveal  the  problem,  together  with  sufficient  but  carefully  selected evidence.  By  Edward  Snowdens’  own  admissions,  he  released  thousands  of government  classified  documents  to  journalists  that  he  had  never reviewed himself.   6.  Basic Cybersecurity Concepts  So far, we have defined what cybersecurity is, where it came from, how it can go wrong and what kinds of roles are involved in putting together an effective cybersecurity team.  In  this  section,  we  look  at  some  of  the  basic  building  blocks  of cybersecurity.     Information Classification  ο Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability & Consent   Cybersecurity Defense Points ο Data, devices, applications, systems and networks.   Cybersecurity Control Types ο Physical, Procedural, Legal & Technical   Cybersecurity Control Modes: ο Preventive, Detective & Corrective  A lot of information about cybersecurity tends to be very focused on technical items such as advanced persistent threats  APTs .  advanced  persistent  threats   APTs   –  a  term  used  to  describe the  continuous  stream  of  attempts  by  hackers  to  infiltrate  digital devices and then leave malicious software in place for the purpose of stealing, corruption  breaking , extortion and or disruption.  We  cover  technical  controls  in  more  detail,  including  APTs,  in chapter 8. However, what should be evident from the case studies is that  there  are  some  far  more  basic  and  critical  factors  to  consider before looking at technical controls.  There  are  also  parts  of  the  digital  landscape  with  very  low  value information  that  could  be  made  public  with  no  damage  and  other   parts that transact and store information so sensitive that we need to take quite extreme security measures.  I  have  heard  it  said  that  Cybersecurity  is  about  only  one  thing: Money. This  is  untrue.  Cybersecurity  is  about  power.  It  might  be  political power,  it  could  be  financial  power;  it  is  often  a  combination  of  the two.  For  example,  when  the  CENTCOM  Twitter  account  was compromised for 40 minutes by Islamic State in January 2015, the motive was not monetary, it was political. The objective was to create discomfort  and  a  sense  of  insecurity  by  openly  demonstrating  a security gap and sending out political messages through it.  If  I  have  good  cybersecurity,  I  control  my  own  power.  If  I  have cybersecurity  gaps  to  anything  significant, someone  else  can  use  my  digital  devices  to  acquire  their  own financial or political gain at my expense.  that  allow  access   The  fact  is  that  we  do  not  necessarily  have  to  have  great cybersecurity everywhere. We do need great cybersecurity on items that can directly or indirectly cause us financial or political damage.  So how do we determine what is significant?  To simplify cybersecurity we need to go right back to basics. What is cybersecurity?  Cybersecurity, in its simplest form, has the purpose to protect digital devices from being exploited or compromised.  Whenever  an  experienced  cybersecurity  manager  looks  at  the cybersecurity position of anything, we ask ourselves this question; Do  I  feel  confident  that  we  have  sufficiently  considered  and addressed  all  of  the  possible  methods  that  might  be  used  to attack or compromise this digital device or digital landscape?   To  become  even  slightly  comfortable  with  being  able  to  respond  to that, we need to consider:  i  all locations within our digital landscape and  ii  all of the potential vectors  methods  that could be a point of failure  or  attack  and   iii   most  importantly  -  the  inherent  value  that each digital location has. The higher the impact and value of any part of the digital landscape, the greater the pain the organization will suffer if it is compromised. That  means  the  most  valuable  digital  locations  need  the  greatest levels of cyber protection.  This is exactly what we do ourselves in our everyday lives. We make sure  that  we  put  the  highest  security  on  our  most  valuable  items. Money,  car,  jewelry;  all  of  these  are  usually  protected  with  security proportionate to their value. If you have $1 you are probably okay to have it in your pocket. If you have one million dollars, you probably will not want to carry it around.  Similarly, if you have a beaten up wreck of a car, you will probably park it anywhere and if you have a car with a million dollar price tag, you probably don’t.  All we are doing in cybersecurity is applying those same principles to electronic  devices  that  use  and  manage  data.  If  they  use  and manage data worth millions, we need to take more precautions than if something only handles a single dollars’ worth of data. We call those precautions controls.  control –  in the context of security and compliance  a method of regulating something, often a process, technology or behavior, to achieve a desired outcome. Depending on how it is designed and used,  any  single  control  may  be  referred  to  as  preventive, detective or corrective.   To be able to put together a cybersecurity defense, we will take a 4 step approach:  1  We have to sort out what groups of information are most valuable  to  be  attacked.  This  is  called  information classification.  2  Once  we  know  what  information  we  are  defending,  we can  understand  where  it  is  located  and  where  it  passes through. These will become our cyber defense points.  3  At each of those defense points, we can use a range of legal  technical  and   security  physically,  procedural,  controls. These are our control types.  4  Some  cyber  defenses  are  proactive,  some  are  detective  reactive   and  some  are  corrective.  These  are  our cybersecurity control modes.  We will now expand and explain each of those steps in order.  Step 1: Information Classification. Each group of information is not of equal value.  If  we  want  to  get  our  cybersecurity  posture  correct,  we  need  to create categories that help us to differentiate the value and danger inherent in each major set of information we have.  The process of determining the value, impact and sensitivity of data is known as information classification.  information classification –the assignment of one or more values to a collection of knowledge that help us understand how alike it is to  any  other  set  of  knowledge.  For  information  security,  this  is usually  achieved  by  assigning  values  against  confidentiality, integrity  and  availability  or  CIA.  A  fourth  category,  consent  is also  sometimes  used  where  the  set  of  knowledge  includes information on private individuals.   confidentiality – the assignment of a value to a set of information to  indicate  the  level  of  secrecy  required  and  used  to  set  access restrictions. A typical example scale for confidentiality is:  i  Public Use   ii   Internal  Use   iii   Confidential   iv   Strictly  Confidential  and  v  Restricted integrity  –the  assignment  of  a  value  to  set  of  information  to indicate its sensitivity to unauthorized modification or loss. Loss in this context is about an inability to recover the information. Often this is expressed or translated into a scale of time. Data with the highest  possible  integrity  rating  would  not  be  allowed  to  lose information or have any unauthorized modification take place. availability – the assignment of a value to a set of information to indicate  its  sensitivity  to  disruption  or  outage.  Often  this  is expressed or translated into a scale of time. Data with the highest possible  availability  rating  would  be  required  to  be  ready  at  all times, often through the use of a fully redundant failsafe. consent – where personal information is involved, there are often legal constraints that govern how the data can be used and where the  information  can  be  viewed,  stored,  transmitted  or  otherwise processed.  These  constraints  can  be  represented  by  a  series  of tags  but  are  much  harder  and  more  sophisticated  to  represent. Required  attributes  can  include  but  are  not  limited  to,  country  of origin,  permission  for  export,  limitations  of  use,  retention  and notification requirements.  Information  classification  is  not  a  new  practice.  It  has  been  an established part of information security of many decades.  the  most   fundamental  cornerstone   for  effective  is  also   It  cybersecurity.   Without  information  classification,  you  have  no  idea  if  you  are protecting something of high value or low value.  Step 2: Cyber Defense Points. Once you know what the most valuable information is, you also need to  know  where  it  is  located  before  you  can  formulate  an  effective cyber defense.  In the first step, classifying our information would let us know what to defend  but  we  still  need  to  understand  where  to  defend  it.  We  will call these our cyber defense points. They are the digital locations where we could add cybersecurity controls.  For every item, I need to consider what it contains and transacts, so that I can ensure the security controls on it that are proportionate to its’ value and the risks it gets exposed to.  There  are  5  layers  of  digital  defense  points  that  are  typical  to consider for cybersecurity:  i  Data – any information in electronic or digital format. ii  Devices – any hardware used to create, modify, process, store  or  transmit  data.  Computers,  smart  phones  and USB drives are all examples of devices.  iii  Applications  –  any  program   software   that  resides  on any  device.  Usually  a  program  exists  to  create,  modify, process, store, inspect or transmit specific types of data.  iv  Systems – groups of applications that operate together to  serve a more complex purpose.  v  Networks –  the  group  name  for  a  collection  of  devices, wiring and applications used to connect, carry, broadcast, monitor or safeguard data. Networks can be physical  use material assets such as wiring  or virtual  use applications to create associations and connections between devices or applications.    You may be wondering what the reason is that makes ‘data’ itself a cyber  defense  point.  The  reason  is  simple;  there  are  security controls that can be applied directly to data. For example, data can be encoded  encrypted  so that even if it is intercepted or copied, it still requires further effort to become accessible. The importance of any item is determined by what it does rather than what it is.  We could have 2 physically identical computers. However, if one of those  computers  is  empty  and  the  other  contains  pre-stock  market announcement  company  the  security requirements will be different.  information,   financial   The  differentiating  factor  is  determined  by  the  value,  impact  and therefore the sensitivity of the contents.  If  we  start  by  identifying  the  most  sensitive  data,   the  electronic information  with  the  highest  value  and  impact  if  compromised  or lost , we can then understand what cyber defense points it exists in and flows through.  That approach will help us to identify how to put appropriate security on our digital landscape in a logical priority order.  This is also where the skills of a security architect can be very useful. Instead of accepting our landscape as it is, a security architect can help  by  evaluating  our  needs  and  creating  a  simpler  and  easier  to defend digital landscape with a smaller and less varied set of cyber defense points.  A  security  architecture  approach  provides  the  opportunity  to  re- design  what  our  information  flows  through  to  make  the  cyber defense points easier and more cost effective to defend. Step 3: Cybersecurity Control Types.   We know what to defend  using information classification  and where to  defend  it   cyber  defense  points .  We  still  need  to  know  how  to defend it.  We  can  consider  that  there  are  4  major  categories  of  security controls that can be used towards cybersecurity:  a. Physical b. Technical c. Procedural d. Legal   also  referred  to  as  regulatory  or  compliance  controls.   If I want to keep some gold bullion safe, I can place it in a locked, alarmed  and  isolated  vault  and  it  should  be  extremely  difficult  to steal. If I have a digital memory card, packed with sensitive information but not attached to anything else, I have exactly the same possibilities.  At this point, although my data is electronic, it is in a physical form.  Potentially,  this  memory  card  is  more  secure  than  a  printed document,  because  although  it  could  be  stolen,  it  needs  to  be inserted into a device before it could be read. Without physical security, other more sophisticated types of cyber defense become less relevant. If someone can physically get to my memory card, they can still steal the physical item or destroy it.  physical security –measures designed to deter, prevent, detect or alert unauthorized real world access to a site or material item.  The  same  thing  can  be  true  of  any  critical  part  of  my  digital landscape. If someone can gain physical access to part of my digital   landscape, they can cause disruption, they can steal it, or they can use it to get access to even more areas.  I  recall  auditing  a  research  site.  The  main  facility  where  over  100 people  worked  was  in  a  physically  secure  office  space.  The  entire buildings network, on the other hand, was managed in an unlocked cupboard, propped open by a cardboard box  to keep the cupboard cool  in the main, open and unmanned lobby.  Anybody  could  have  walked  in  off  the  street,  unchallenged  and pulled  out  2  wires  and  stopped  all  100  people  from  working.  They could equally have plugged something into the network and already been behind all of the technical defenses that were in place at that location.  Almost all technical controls are ineffective if physical access can be gained to restricted equipment.  Technical controls are given the most focus in cybersecurity.  If  we  return  to  our  memory  card  example;  if  I  encoded   encrypted  the information on the card, that would be an example of a technical security  control.  I  would  have  done  something  electronically  to secure the item. It might not prevent the theft of the item but it could prevent the information from being exposed.  technical control –  the  use  of  an  electronic  or  digital  method  to influence or command how something is or is not able to be used.  Cybersecurity  is  very  focused  on  technical  controls.  This  is  mostly because  many  technologies  are  so  new;  they  often  open  up  new technical vulnerabilities.  The next control type to consider is procedural.   procedural control – the use of a sequence of steps to influence or command how something is or is not able to be used.  An  example  of  a  procedural  control  is  to  require  a  minimum  of  2 authorized people to approve any access request. This is the use of any process  enforced or otherwise  that has a purpose of helping to strengthen a security position.  The  last  category  can  be  referred  to  as  legal,  regulatory  or compliance controls.  legal control – the use of legislation to help promote and invest in positive  security  methods  and  also  to  deter,  punish  and  correct infringements.  Whenever you hear about a large financial penalty being imposed on an  organization,  that  is  an  example  of  the  consequences  of  not meeting a legal control requirement.  Many  companies  can  seek  to  pass  some  of  their  legal  financial responsibilities on to their employees or suppliers as an incentive to promote  good  practices.  It  is  also  normal  for  any  breach  in  legal controls to result in disciplinary action.  We have only covered these 4 areas very briefly. What is necessary to understand is that any effective cybersecurity approach will need to be effective in all four types of control areas.  Maintaining  technical  controls  alone  will  not  result  in  effective cybersecurity.  Step 4: Control Modes. Imagine I want to protect my own smart phone.   There are 3 basic ways to protect my phone:  1  I  can  proactively  take  measures  that  should  prevent  it  from being compromised.  2  I  could  add  mechanisms  to  help  detect  if  it  is  being  compromised.  3  If, later on, I become aware of any gap in my defenses, I might  be  able  to  reactively  correct  and  address  any problem.  So I can use:    Preventive controls To protect the device before any event happens.   Detective controls To monitor and alert me in the event something happens.   Corrective controls To rectify any gaps after the problem has been identified.  Where I am smart enough to know about a gap I can stop, I can use a preventive control up front. I  can  also  set-up  methods  to  help  detect  anything  unusual,  just  in case I missed something.  If I did miss anything, I can always go back and address the issue later, but that could be after I already lost a phone!  What you should notice is that these are all time based definitions. These are control modes.  control  modes  –  an  umbrella  term  for  preventive,  detective  and corrective  methods  of  defense.  Each  one  represents  a  different time posture, preventive controls are designed to stop an attack before it is successful, detective controls are designed to monitor and alert during a potential compromise and corrective controls are the rectification of an issue after an event.   What I do in advance is preventive, what I do during is detective and what I do after a problem is corrective.  Just  like  any  other  security,  cybersecurity  uses  all  3  of  these methods to help protect digital devices from being compromised.  In an ideal world, we would know all the ways our phone might be compromised  and  be  able  to  have  enough  preventive  controls  to stop  anything  from  happening.  In  the  real  world,  we  don’t  know enough to rely only on preventive controls.  A Final Note: Defense in Depth. We have covered a lot of information in this chapter.    The  need  to  classify  information,  so  we  know  what  to  protect.    The  need  to  understand  where  that  information  flows  through, so we know where to protect.    An introduction to the range of security control types open to us, so we know cybersecurity is not just about technical and proactive methods of protection.  Earlier in the book we mentioned and e defined ‘Defense-in-Depth’ and this is a good point to revisit that topic. It is always easier to mount an effective attack than to put together an  effective  defense.  An  effective  defense  requires  you  to adequately protect everything. An effective attack only needs to find a single vulnerability.  For  that  reason,  cybersecurity  for  the  digital  landscape  requires multiple layers, checks and balances to be effective.  The larger the territory and the more assets I have within it, the more complex  my  cybersecurity  challenge  will  be.  That  is  because  it  will be easier for vulnerabilities to appear and go undetected.   However, based on root cause analysis of very public cybersecurity losses  it  is  repeatedly  shown  that  technical  security  gaps  can  only fail when other security controls are also inadequate.  Great information security is still a foundation that we need to apply before we can hope to achieve great cybersecurity. In other words, it is  still  necessary  to  take  the  same  basic,  initial  security  steps  in cybersecurity that we would in traditional information security.  If you truly follow a defense-in-depth strategy and use the full set of security  strategies  and  layers,  it  will  be  almost  impossible  for  the emergence  of  a  single  technical  issue  to  create  a  cybersecurity disaster.  Following the basic principles that have existed for security for years is  a  necessary  foundation  for  cybersecurity.  To  achieve  a  secure digital environment, all potential vulnerabilities need to be considered and addressed.  Also  remember  that  security  controls  are  only  effective  when  they are operational and enforceable.   7.  Human Factors  People are regarded as the weakest link in cybersecurity.  What we will aim to cover in this chapter are the primary ways that human  factors  are  frequently  either  the  root  cause  or  a  substantial contributor to successful cybersecurity failures.  The most significant human factors are:     Inadequate  cybersecurity  subject  knowledge  leading to the presence of large amounts of open vulnerabilities.    Poor  capture  and  communication  of  risks  leading  to  repeated, unanticipated failures of cybersecurity.    Culture and relationship issues,  both  in  the  enterprise itself  or  key  suppliers,  creates  disinterested  and disaffected personnel with insider knowledge.    Under-investment  in  security  training  resulting  in  low awareness of the security risks we all manage  even if we are not cybersecurity personnel .    Using  trust  in  place  of  procedures,  especially  for  privileged personnel.    Absence  of  a  single  point  of  accountability.  When  more than one person is accountable, nobody is.    Social  engineering,  picking  up   from personnel  through  traditional  espionage  techniques  in order  to  leverage  their  access  or  knowledge  to  create opportunities that bypass other security controls.  information   The  case  studies  in  this  book  have  been  chosen  because  they represent, from experience, the same blend of factors often present in the largest failures in cybersecurity. It is no coincidence that each one contains a number of human factors as part of the cybersecurity breach.   Before we look more closely at each of these areas, I would like to share  some  real  world  examples  of  how  problems  with  human factors are easy to detect and therefore easy to take advantage of.  If  you  have  poor  cybersecurity,  people  inside  and  close  to  your organization  know  it  and  talk  about  it.  It  is  incredibly  easy  for  a cybersecurity  professional  to  find  out  how  strong  or  weak  your enterprises cybersecurity posture is with only a few, difficult to avoid questions in any social setting.  After a 2 day onsite security audit at a supplier, I was once asked the following question by their Chief Information Security Officer:  ‘We had a full, month long internal audit a short time ago. They sent 3 people in for nearly 6 weeks. What I would like to ask is this. You were  here,  alone,  for  just  over  2  days  and  you  not  only  found everything they did but also some valid items that they missed. We could have saved ourselves a lot of time and money. But what I want to know is – How did you do it?’  I  thought  for  a  few  seconds  about  whether  to  reveal  the  secret.  I decided with the audit over, I could.  ‘Body Language.’ I replied.  I had my full list of checks to go through but 2 days never allowed me much time to test many of them in any depth. I would run through the  checks  in  an  interview  style  and  then  the  second  the  body language around the table showed signs of discomfort, I knew to dig.  The  larger  the  group  of  people  that  the  company  brought  along  to the  meeting,  the  easier  the  audit  became.  I  recall  one  audit  in  the Philippines held the record for the most attendees, due partly I think to  the  contract  size  involved,  they  brought  28  people  to  the  audit room.   In  fact,  there  was  a  larger  secret  I  had  not  revealed.  Culture.  In organizations where there was a great culture for the betterment of the staff, people tended to like each other more and get on better. If there  was  a  problem,  they  would  bring  it  up  and  sort  it  out. Organizations with great culture and good team workmanship tended to have less gaps and problems.  I  was  also  able  to  test  and  check  this  in  reverse.  I  would  often  be called  in  to  audit  an  organization  after  some  kind  of  significant failure.  In  all  cases,  without  exception,  there  were  significant, contributing human factors. Often this could be as simple as putting too  much  work  on  to  too  few  people,  creating  stress,  bypassing, ignoring or just not putting controls in place. Inadequate cybersecurity subject knowledge. Although cybersecurity also has a reliance on traditional security, the speed  of  emerging  technology  adoption  creates  more  potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities all the time.  It is not humanly possible to stay on top of the emerging threats and attack  vectors  unless  you  dedicate  a  substantial  amount  of  time  to continuous learning.  As  a  cybersecurity  management  specialist,  I  spend  around  20%  of my  professional  time  reading  and  learning  about  new  technologies and threats. Although that allows me to keep up on the main risks, there are frequent occasions where I have to go and research a new technology and threat type.  Cybersecurity  is  not  a  static  discipline  that  can  be  learned  and applied for years. An ongoing and substantial personal investment is required to stay on top of the subject area.  If  you  do  not  require  your  cybersecurity  staff  to  hold  and  maintain current  certifications  from  a  recognized  authority,  you  will  have issues with their level of cybersecurity knowledge.   The  only  thing  more  dangerous  than  training  a  cybersecurity employee who may then leave is not training them and having them stay. Poor capture and communication of risks. Chapter  11  is  dedicated  to  this  important  subject  area.  There  are, however, human factors to consider around how risks are captured and communicated.  People often notice risks that can create substantial damage to their organization but do not report them. There can be three reasons for this.  1  The  risk  does  not  directly  impact  the  persons  own immediate  location,  department  or  budget.  This  is  an example of silo thinking.  2  There  can  even  be  negative  personal  or  career consequences for reporting risk. Current enterprises often perceive  that  formal  reporting  of  risk  itself  can  be  in conflict  with  their  risk  appetite.  If  there  is  no  easy mechanism  or  reward  for  reporting  suspected  risks,  why do it?  3  If the process for filtering and escalating risks is not very well developed, the recipient of the risk information that is reported  may  be  more  inclined  to  bury  it  than  to communicate and manage it.  Any  organization  that  actively  encourages  their  staff  to  identify  and report  risks  that  can  create  substantial  impact  into  a  formal framework  will  create  a  more  less  vulnerable enterprise. Culture and relationship issues. Many  cybersecurity  threats  are  created  from  within.  If  you  have  a corporate  culture  that  creates  disaffected  or  disinterested  staff,  it  is  informed  and    much more likely that you will experience this threat type.  In your organization, do people generally like each other, do they get on  well  and  do  they  feel  that  the  company  invests  in  them  and considers them to be more than an asset with an id number?  feels  no  connection  or  support   When  a  person  their organization, it is more likely that they will seek opportunities to take personal advantage of their position. This is because they feel that their enterprise is acting in this way towards them.  from   In  large  but  brand  sensitive  or  regulated  organizations,  the  whistle blowing process is often a key indicator of the enterprise culture. It is important to put self-assessment criteria in place to help people filter items  that  need  to  bypass  normal  escalation  paths.  It  is  equally important  that  those  mechanisms  are  in  place.  There  are  many cybersecurity  failures  that  could  have  been  prevented  if  people  felt there  were  mechanisms  in  place  to  directly  expose  substantial problems through an independent reporting structure.  The more open and supportive an organization is about its people, the  more  the  people  will  be  supportive  of  it.  Any  closed  and unsupportive organization will create vulnerabilities through general disinterest from its employees and rogue insiders feeling justified in seeking to use their knowledge and access for personal gain.  It is much easier for a cybersecurity attack to be successful with the help  of  any  insider.  A  person  in  an  organization  does  not  need  to have privileged access to be able to provide significant intelligence for a cyber attack. They may even be authorized to access and take the information anyway, rendering all other forms of security controls useless.  Never  underestimate  how  much  the  culture  in  any  enterprise  will correlate with its’ security posture.   In my own experience, an enterprise with a negative culture will be riddled with security gaps and people ready to help expose them. Under-investment in security training. Does anybody reading this book maintain a separate username and password  In  a cybersecurity  lecture  I  recently  attended  at  the  Royal  Institution  in London,  packed  full  of  security  specialists  about  20%  of  the  hands went into the air.  for  every  different  web  account   they  use?   ‘325 and counting’ said one person.  Whenever  a  cybersecurity  attack  is  successful  at  obtaining username and password details, one of the first things the criminals are likely to do is use automatic tools to try and re-use those same credentials on all the major web services.  Employees, suppliers and even customers need to be aware of how their actions can create, deter and detect security issues. This fact is deeply relevant to cybersecurity.  All of these people may need access to your digital systems. Anyone with access needs practical and regular awareness training on what the  potential  security  threats  are,  how  to  avoid  them  and  how  to report any suspected or confirmed security problem.  Security  awareness  needs  to  include  specific  and  practical  content about  security  threats  to  any  relevant  electronic  information  or systems that person may have access to. For example:    Do  not  leave  your  computer  or  mobile  device  unlocked  when you are not with it and using it.    Never  mix  alcohol  with  using  any  digital  device   phone,  tablet or computer  that can access work systems.    Never  discuss  or  speak  about  work  when  intoxicated,  have fun instead.     Be  aware  that  malicious  software  can  be  loaded  on  to your  computer,  phone  or  tablet  simply  by  clicking  on  a link.  For  that  reason,  do  not  click  on  any  link  that  you believe may not be safe.  Good  security  awareness  training  should  be  concise,  relevant, useful, thought-provoking and frequent. It also needs to be updated regularly, meaning at least once per year. Cybersecurity  is  not  a  purely  technical  problem  for  the  technical team.  People  are  more  likely  to  create  cybersecurity  failures  than technology.  Security  awareness  is  the  primary  way  to  make  this known. Using trust in place of procedures. As a species, we tend to use failure as a learning mechanism. Only after something goes wrong do we tend to fix it. Often,  especially  few privileged  and  trusted  people.  They  have  always  been  there,  they have always done the right thing and to add in procedures that move away  from  the  trust  system  can  seem  both  expensive  and unnecessary. What I have written in the paragraph above is the usual explanation that is used just after an organization was badly burned by the failure of trust issue.  for  growing  organizations,   there  are  a   Edward Snowden is a great example of the problem. He had worked as a safe pair of hands in government security for years. What could possibly go wrong?  At any point in any process that has any privilege associated with it, it is essential that procedures are in place to ensure that the action cannot be independently executed based on trust alone.   Even if a person is a Chief Cybersecurity Officer  in fact, especially if they  are ,  it  should  not  be  possible  for  them  to  directly  control  and access the security infrastructure they are assigned to protect.  The  degree  of  procedures  that  control  and  monitor  access  and privilege  should  always  be  proportionate  to  the  sensitivity  of  the assets.  The  more  sensitive  the  permissions  and  the  assets,  the greater  the  need  for  additional  measures  to  monitor,  review,  check and approve the actions. Absence of a single point of accountability. Another cornerstone in the area of security is to ensure that anything that must be controlled and managed well must have a single point of accountability.  single point  of  accountability –  abbreviation SPA or SPOA  is the  requirement  to  have  an  individual  owner  identified  for  the protection  of  each  process  or  asset  where  a  failure  can  create substantial impact. The rationale is that the absence of a defined, single  owner  is  a  frequent  cause  of  process  or  asset  protection failure.  The process of single point of accountability works incredibly well. It has been used to help control highly regulated systems successfully and without fault.  Shared accountability does not work well. Whenever more than one person is assigned as an owner, the accountability is unclear. In the event  of  any  failure,  instead  of  being  equally  accountable,  shared owners expect to be equally unaccountable.  Due  to  the  complex  nature  of  modern  organizations,  there  can sometimes  be  issues  when  the  roles  and  responsibilities  between different owners overlap. Roles and responsibilities between different   owners  should  be  clearly  contained  within  boundaries  that  do  not overlap.  For  example,  if  I  own  a  system  and  you  own  a  process  that maintains it. If your process causes my system to break, that defect and  the  costs  and  consequences  of  failure  are  yours,  the  repair  of the system and recovery of costs from you are my responsibility. Social Engineering. You  can  have  the  world  and  be compromised  by  one  social  encounter.  Social  engineering   or traditional espionage  is the most fascinating of the human factors.  the  best  cybersecurity   in   social  engineering  –  is  the  art  of  manipulating  people  through personal interaction to gain unauthorized access to something.  It  is  a  constant  surprise  to  me  how  much  easier  it  is  to  get information through social activities than through direct attack.  If you put on a boiler suit with a logo, carry a clipboard and have a sense of confidence, you can physically access a lot of sites that you should  not  be  able  to.  However,  most  social  engineering  that  can impact cybersecurity is far less risky.  A team blend of espionage and geek is very effective. Intentionally placing  agents  in  situations  where  they  can  get  close  enough  to ‘trusted’ people, or inside trusted suppliers to extract very sensitive information is unfortunately quite easy.  Whenever anybody gets friendly with someone else, they will have a propensity  to  start  to  disclose  and  discuss  items,  or  let  their  guard down on access to an access that is inside the digital network.  A  small  amount  of  insider  knowledge,  even  from  a  non-technical person can easily be enough to get past many layers of security.   The main protection against social engineering is through awareness training, with real life examples.  Here is my example:  Bob worked as the only security guard in the main lobby of a building with  1,000  employees.  The  access  control  gate  was  too  slow  to operate in the mornings; so instead, Bob would need to individually buzz  the  gate  open.  Security  had  become  relaxed  and  so  people used to greet Bob ‘Hey Bob’ and then he would buzz them in. It was clear from the look on Bob’s face that he probably had no idea who most of them were. Perhaps he knew a few hundred of them.  Here are my social engineering questions:        If I told you this story in a bar and where I worked, do you think you could get in to my building? If  you  visited  the  lobby  once  for  a  legitimate  reason,  do you think you might have noticed this security gap?  Many  cybersecurity  attacks  are  crimes  of  opportunity.  Social engineering attacks also are not always pre-meditated. If the wrong information  is  passed  to  the  wrong  person  at  the  wrong  time,  the opportunity can create the attack. As  part  of  any  defense  in  depth,  it  is  essential  to  consider  that human  factors  are  the  most  likely  to  create  the  opportunities  that lead to a successful cybersecurity failure.  If you ever get the chance, add a question on human factors to the root  cause  analysis  section  of  any  incident  response  procedure. Something like this:  Were  any  of  the  following  human  factors  identified  as  contributing towards the security failure?    Gaps in the procedures that should have been in place.     Risks  that  were  known  to  some  but  not  reported  or  managed effectively.    Disinterested or disaffected personnel.   A  lack  of  security  awareness  by  any  of  the  people  involved.    A  level  of  access  privilege  that  was  not  adequately  monitored or segregated.    Any form of social manipulation or fiction by an individual  to gain access to information or systems.  There  are  of  course,  another  set  of  human  factors  to  consider;  the profile  and  philosophy  of  the  people  who  instigate  cyber  attacks. These factors are considered in Chapter 10: The Cybersecurity Cold War. Before  we  approach  who  initiates  and  performs  cyber  attacks,  we need to complete our understanding of cyber defense. To do that, we now need to cover the central core of cyber defense.   8.  Technical Cybersecurity  In  this  chapter,  we  cover  what  was  referred  to  earlier  as technical controls, using a six step approach:   What is an attack surface?   The lifecycle of a standard cybersecurity attack.   Basic methods of technical defense.   Evolving methods of attack  vectors .   More advanced methods of defense.   Other methods of cyber attack and defense.  As  we  have  progressed  through  the  book,  a  lot  of  technical  terms have slowly been introduced. In this chapter, the first time we use a technical term that has already been defined earlier in the book it will be  highlighted  in  bold  and  italic  text.  You  can  then  refer  to  the dictionary  at  the  back  of  the  book  if  you  need  to  refresh  your understanding of the meaning. If  we  introduce  a  new  technical  term  for  the  first  time,  we  will   as usual  define it directly under the paragraph where it is first used.  Many  cybersecurity  courses  and  certifications  focus  almost  entirely on  technical  controls.  That  is  a  valid  approach  if  you  only  need  to acquire a limited, additional set of technical skills. For example, an existing  information  security  professional  would  already  be  familiar with many of the security controls that have been covered earlier in this book.  It is important to remember that even the best technical controls can still be completely circumvented by non-technical means.  Technical  controls  are  critical  to  cybersecurity.  So  are  other  non- technical layers of defense.   Defense in depth cannot be achieved without using all of the security control methods, technical, physical, procedural and others.  Remember:  An  effective  defense  requires  a  comprehensive approach.  A  successful  attack  can  happen  through  a  single vulnerability. What is an Attack Surface? For a cyber attack to be successful, the first thing it needs to achieve is a point of entry.  When defending a digital landscape, we need to understand where the  attackers  could  target.  This  target  area  is  referred  to  as  the attack surface.  attack  surface  –  the  sum  of  the  different  points  where  an unauthorized user  the “attacker”  can try to enter data to or extract data from an environment.  Back  in  chapter  six  we  looked  at  cyber  defense  points  and identified five major categories:  i  Data – any information in electronic or digital format. ii  Devices – any hardware used to create, modify, process, store  or  transmit  data.  Computers,  smart  phones  and USB drives are all examples of devices.  iii  Applications  –  any  program   software   that  resides  on any  device.  Usually  a  program  exists  to  create,  modify, process, store, inspect or transmit specific types of data.  iv  Systems – groups of applications that operate together to  serve a more complex purpose.  v  Networks –  the  group  name  for  a  collection  of  devices, wiring and applications used to connect, carry, broadcast, monitor or safeguard data. Networks can be physical  use   material assets such as wiring  or virtual  use applications to create associations and connections between devices or applications.   If any item from the list above carries or handles information for our enterprise, it will be part of our potential attack surface. Even if an application exists within a supplier, if it contains our data or provides critical services, any consequences of a successful cyber attack will still usually be our legal liability. That means that we have to  remember  to  include  these  external  parts  when  considering  our attack surface.  We may not be responsible for operating these external systems, but we are responsible for ensuring the correct security is in place and we  are  also  accountable  if  it  fails  to  protect  our  services  or information.  Part of the role of the security architect is to seek to reduce the size of  the  attack  surface,  at  the  same  time  as  sustaining  business needs. Where the size and complexity of the attack surface can be reduced,  the  attack  surface  becomes  easier  and  lower  effort  to defend.  A  further  valid  approach  for  reducing  the  risk  is  to  sub-divide  the attack  surface.  The  approach  of  network  segmentation  provides greater resilience.  network  segmentation  –  splitting  a  single  collection  of  devices, wiring  and  applications  that  connect,  carry  broadcast,  monitor  or safeguard data into smaller sections. This allows for more discrete management  of  each  section,  allowing  greater  security  to  be applied in sections of the highest value and also allowing smaller sections to be impacted in the event of a malware infection or other disruptive event.   If  one  segment  is  attacked  or  otherwise  compromised,  it  can  be isolated with less overall impact to the full digital landscape used by our organization.  In  addition,  it  is  possible  to  create  different  security  zones.  Higher security  can  then  be  applied  to  attack  surfaces   including  network segments   where  higher  value  data  is  stored  or  transacted.  Lower  and less costly  security can be used where the information stored or transacted is itself of low value.  Care must be taken when evaluating where lower levels of security can  be  permitted.  This  is  because  there  are  frequent  examples  of attack exploits that have used low security areas of an attack surface as:   i  An access route to higher security areas.  ii  To  subvert  the  lower  security  zone  assets  for  denial  of   iii  To use data that has been misclassified as low value for a  service attacks.  high value attack.  The Lifecycle of a Cybersecurity Attack: Most  cyber  attacks  involve  malware.  If  malware  is  involved,  there are usually four basic stages to the attack process. These are:   i  Infection  ii  Persistence  iii  Communication  iv Control  This lifecycle is usually described as advanced persistent threats, also known as APTs. These are defined earlier in the book and can also be found in the definitions section.  We will now look at each stage of the lifecycle in more detail.  Infection.   During  the  infection  stage,  the  attacker  seeks  to  use  any  method possible to place malware into any part of your attack surface.  infection –  in the context of cybersecurity  unwanted invasion by an outside agent that has intent to create damage or disruption.  Persistence.  Once  in  place  the  malware  will  aim  to  persist  by  using  as  many opportunities as it can to bypass or disable defenses, copy itself into locations  where  it  can  re-install  whenever  an  asset  is  reset  or restored and disguise itself as an inconspicuous file.  Seeking to remain in place within the attack surface is referred to as persistence.  A  frequent  target  for  malware  to  persist  is  for  it  to install into the master boot record.  persistence –to seek continued existence despite opposition. master boot record –the first sector on any electronic device that defines  what  operating  system  should  be  loaded  when  it  is initialized or re-started.  Installing on the master boot record allows the malware to re-install itself when a device is re-started. This offers the potential to disable or bypass other security measures that may be commenced during the start-up  or ‘boot’  sequence. Often  the  malware  will  use  an  exploitation  known  as  a  buffer overflow   intentionally  writing  more  data  to  the  memory  than  is possible  to achieve command level access known as shell access.  exploitation  –intentionally  misusing  something  to  gain  an  unfair advantage over it.   buffer overflow –exceeding the region of electronic memory used to  temporarily  store  data  when  it  is  being  moved  between locations.  This  process  is  used  by  some  forms  of  malware  to exploit an electronic target. shell  access  –  command  level  permission  to  perform  executive control over an electronic device.  Communication.  To  be  effective,  malware  will  usually  need  to communicate.  Communication   inbound  and  outbound  can  allow malware to do one or more of the following:  to  be  able     Find other malware to cooperate with.   Exfiltrate stolen information.   Take  instruction  from  the  attack  controller   for  example  –  from a bot herder.   bot herder – is a hacker who uses automated techniques to seek vulnerable networks and systems. Their initial goal is to install or find bot programs they can use. Once they have one or more bots in  place,  they  can  control  these  to  perform  a  larger  objective  of stealing,  corrupting  and or  disrupting  information,  assets  and services. See also botnet. bot- is a computer program designed to perform tasks. They are usually simple, small and designed to perform fast, repetitive tasks. Where  the  purpose  of  the  program  is  in  conflict  with  the organization, they can be considered to be a form of malware. See also botnet.  If  malware  can  communicate,  it  can  often  be  remotely  adapted  to  new change  or  add   functions  and  even   receive  updates    programming  that allow it to continue to avoid damage or take even greater advantage of the infiltration point it has achieved.  Each  piece  of  malware  will  often  have  multiple  communication options.  If  one  communication  line  is  ineffective,  it  can  switch  to another. It can also receive updates about new communication paths or if it can find other familiar malware, it can potentially use that to pass information.  Any attacker will usually seek to install or leverage large numbers of bots,  a  robotic  network  referred  to  as  a  botnet.  This  provides  a higher  resiliency  to  the  attack,  together  with  a  greater  number  of potential communication channels.  Control:  Once  malware  is  in  place,  persisting  and  communicating,  the attacker  can  then  coordinate,  update  and  direct  what  the  malware does.  If malware can be prevented from communicating with the controller, it can often become harmless. If malware is no longer able to receive instruction,  or  send  out  stolen  information,  in  most  cases  it  can  be rendered ineffective. Some  forms  of  cyber  defense  use decapitation  as  one  method  of stopping  malware  after  it  has  already  achieved  infection  and persistent in the attack surface.  decapitation –  in the context of malware  to remove the ability for malware to send or receive instructions and other information from the controlling attacker. This can effectively render many forms of malware ineffective. This is a method of takedown.  Basic Methods of Technical Defense:   For each part of the attack surface  also known as the cyber defense points , there are a range of options that can be used to prevent or detect cyber attack.  It takes considerably more effort to manage a cyber attack once an infection  has  been  successful.  Once  an  attacker  has  gained unauthorized access it is not unknown for the malware to be able to persist for months or even years.  It  is  more  effective  to  prevent  infection  or  intrusion  than  to  take corrective measures afterwards.  In  the  early  days  of  technical  protection,  most  attacks  took  place through  email.  This  is  no  longer  the  case.  Attackers  will  use  any vector   method  of  attack  they  can.  The  evolving  techniques  are covered in the next part of this chapter.  Attacks can happen anywhere on your attack surface, so we should consider  the  primary  methods  of  defense  and  where  they  can  be deployed.  Remember  the  key  components  of  your  attack  surface are:    Data   Networks   Devices   Applications   Systems  We  should  also  define  the  difference  between  host-based  and network-based defenses.  host  based  –  describes  a  situation  where  something  is  installed immediately on the device it is protecting, servicing or subverting. network-based  –describes  a  situation  where  something  is installed  to  protect,  serve  or  subvert  the  community  of  devices,   wiring and applications used to connect, carry, broadcast, monitor or safeguard information  the network .  Many  years  ago,  it  was  considered  sufficient  to  place  security measures  only  on  devices   host-based  security .  This  is  no  longer adequate.  Any  enterprise  will  now  run  security  everywhere  it  can. This  means  every  part  of  the  attack  surface  should  include  an adequate and appropriate spread of security defenses.  The primary technical methods of defense can be considered to be:    Anti-malware.   Firewalls.     Data Loss Prevention.   Encryption     cryptography   although  this  is  also  used  for  Intrusion Prevention & Intrusion Detection.  attack .    Proxy  servers   again,  also  used  for  both  attack  and  defense . Identity and Access Controls      Penetration testing.   Vulnerability assessment.  We  will  now  briefly  provide  a  basic  definition  of  each  one  of  these primary, technical security controls. Anti-malware:  anti-malware  –  is  a  computer  program  designed  to  look  for specific files and behaviors  signatures  that indicate the presence or  the  attempted  installation  of  malicious  software.  If  or  when detected, the program seeks to isolate the attack  quarantine the malware , remove it if it can and also alert appropriate people to the attempt or to their presence.   signatures  –   in  the  context  of  cybersecurity   are  the  unique attributes, for example, file size, file extension, data usage patterns and method of operation, that identify a specific computer program. Anti-malware  and  other  security  software  make  use  of  this information to identify and manage rogue software.  Anti-malware  is  a  primary  method  of  defense.  To  be  effective,  it  is usually installed on as many different parts of the attack surface as possible.  This  will  usually  include  user  devices   computers,  smart phones, tablets, ...  and network hardware.  More  advanced  applications  and  systems  can  also  have  their  own, additional  anti-malware  that  operates  during  certain  functions,  for example,  to  scan  any  uploaded  files  for  threats  before  they  are permitted  to  be  stored,  read  or  otherwise  used.  This  is  particularly important  because  applications  and  systems  may  use  forms  of encryption  that  can  bypass  other  security  defenses,  masquerading as application data.  Anti-malware needs to be regularly updated with the latest signature files that contain information about new and updated threats.  By itself, anti-malware was once considered to capture and contain up to 90% of all attacks. That figure has dropped substantially and is now  thought  to  be  lower  than  50%.  That  still  makes  this  form  of defense the most important, single security control.  Firewalls:  firewall  –  is  a  hardware   physical  device   or  software   computer program  used to monitor and protect inbound and outbound data  electronic information . It achieves this by applying a set of rules. These  physical  devices  or  computer  programs  are  usually deployed, at a minimum, at the perimeter of each network access point. Software firewalls can also be deployed on devices to add   further security. The rules applied within a firewall are known as the firewall policy.  Firewalls act as gatekeepers at the borders of each network and on devices also. Early  firewalls  relied  mainly  on  understanding  the  senders internet protocol   IP   address,  the  destination  port  number  and  the protocol  method of communication  being used.  protocol –  in the context of electronic communication  is a set of established  rules  used  to  send  information  between  different electronic locations. They provide a standard that can be used to send  or  receive  information  in  an  expected  and  understandable format,  including  information  about  the  source,  destination  and route.  Examples  of  protocols  include,  internet  protocol   IP , hyper  text  transfer  protocol   HTTP ,  file  transfer  protocol  FTP ,  transmission  control  protocol   TCP ,  border  gateway protocol   BGP   and  dynamic  host  configuration  protocol  DHCP . internet  protocol  –  is  the  set  of  rules  used  to  send  or  receive information from or to location on a network, including information about  the  source,  destination  and  route.  Each  electronic  location  host  has a unique address  the IP address   used  to  define  the source and the destination. port number – used as part of electronic communication to denote the method of communication being used. This allows the packet to be directed to a program that will know what to do with it.  packet –  in the context of electronic communication  is a bundle of  electronic  information  grouped  together  for  transmission.  The   bundle  usually  includes  control  information  to  indicate  the destination,  source  and  type  of  payload,  and  the  payload   user information  itself. Further definitions for bolded terms in this section can be found in the Cybersecurity to English section of this book.  The allowable and prohibited values would be stored as the firewall policy. This was known as a packet-filtering approach. It allowed for fast throughput but does not inspect the content of the packets. This made it vulnerable to spoofing. A good firewall policy is usually recognizable by having only a small number of allowed rules and being reviewed and checked frequently to ensure it remains configured to guard against the latest threats.  packet-filtering  –passing  or  blocking  bundles  of  electronic information based on rules. See also packet. spoofing – concealing the true source or electronic information by impersonation  or  other  means.  Often  used  to  bypass  internet security filters by pretending the source is from a trusted location.  In addition to packet-filtering and port blocking, firewalls now include intrusion more  defenses,  detection and other methods that are explained below. Intrusion Prevention and Intrusion Detection:  intrusion  prevention,   including   inspects  electronic  communications   Intrusion  Prevention  Systems   IPS   –a  computer  program  that monitors  and  that  pass through it, with the purpose to block and log  record  any malicious or otherwise unwanted streams of information. These are usually placed in the communication path to allow the prevention  dropping   or  blocking  of  packets   to  occur.  They  can  also  clean  some electronic  data  to  remove  any  unwanted  or  undesirable  packet components.  inspects  electronic  communications   Intrusion  Detection  Systems   IDS   –  a  computer  program  that monitors  and  that  pass through it, with the purpose to detect, log  record  and raise alerts on  any  suspected  malicious  or  otherwise  unwanted  streams  of information. Intrusion  Detection  and  Prevention  Systems   IDPS   –  a computer  program  inspects  electronic communications that pass through it, with the purpose to block and log  any  known  malicious  or  otherwise  unwanted  streams  of information and to log and raise alerts about any other traffic that is suspected  but not confirmed  to be of a similar nature.  that  monitors  and   Prevention is always preferable to detection alone. If you detect an intrusion  after  the  event,  then  the  overhead  to  correct  the  issue  is greater.  There are two key challenges for these systems.  The  first  problem  is  how  to  ‘know’  what  a  malicious  or  unwanted communication  looks  like.  This  can  be  achieved  by  three  different methods:    Known patterns for attack communication can be stored. These  are  known  as  signatures.  These  can  then  be specifically  detected  and   in  intrusion prevention  blocked. It is also possible for the programs to review statistics and look for any behavior that is unusual or anomalous. This  the  case  of       form of detection is known as statistical anomaly based detection.    Sometimes,  malicious  or  unwanted  communications adjust the packets they are sent in so that the protocol is different  from  its  usual  format.  Detecting  significant variations  in  protocol  format  can  also  be  used.  This  is known as stateful protocol analysis detection.  The  second  and  more  significant  issue  is  that  people  want  their communications  quickly  and  without  interruption.  The  number  of rules  applied  and  the  frequency  of  encountering  detection  and prevention  systems  is  a  balancing  act  between  security  and performance. If too many rules and restrictions are in place, then electronic traffic  communications  can be lost or delayed. If too few are in place, then unwanted  data  can  enter  and  leave  without  being  detected  or blocked.  Data Loss Prevention:  Data Loss Prevention  DLP  – is a term that describes blocking specific  types  of  information  from  leaving  an  electronic  device. There are dedicated types of hardware and software that can be used to assist in this objective.  One  of  the  key  objectives  for  any  attack  is  to  steal  information  of value.  That  valuable  information  usually  has  certain  attributes  that can also be used to defend it.  Increased security to help prevent data loss can be achieved through technologies positioned in key parts of your digital landscape.  Host  based  data  loss  prevention  can  help  to  stop  people  from sending  critical,  sensitive  or  otherwise  valuable  information  outside   of the enterprise network.  Network  based  data  loss  prevention  can  control  the  types  of information that are permitted to transfer between locations.  The  organization  that  is  putting  data  loss  prevention  in  place  must define  the  business  rules   criteria   that  will  be  applied  to  permit  or deny  certain  types  of  information  from  traveling.  Information classification,  covered  earlier  in  the  book,  can  be  used  as  part  of this; however, advanced data loss programs can also automatically detect  the  presence  of  certain  information,  even  if  it  has  not  been classified. Any attempts to move information against company rules can then be either blocked or challenged.  Any critical information that is permitted to travel can also be made more  secure  through  the  use  of  additional  encryption   covered below .  Specialist data loss prevention technologies have proven particularly useful  when  applied  directly  to  the  devices   computers,  smart phones  and  tablets   that  people  use  and  also  on  critical  business applications that transact large volumes of information, for example on email services and financial systems.  In  addition  to  blocking  the  movement  of  data,  these  security programs  can  also  raise  alerts  and  even  insert  trace  components into the packets without the user’s knowledge.  These  technologies  are  also  very  high  value  in  any  location  where substantial  personal  information  is  transacted.  They  can  help  to ensure  that  requirements  from  privacy  regulations  are  provably enforced.  Encryption   cryptography:  The  art  of  encoding  messages  so  that  they  cannot  be  read  by anybody who intercepts them has existed for a very long time.   An advantage of encryption is that it is a security technique that can be  applied  directly  to  the  data.  Without  the  ability  to  decrypt  the information, the data is just a useless jumble of characters.  Although very useful to help secure general communications, there are two major problems with encryption:  The  first  problem  is  that  encrypted  information  is  very  much  like carrying a diplomatic case. Nobody can inspect the contents unless they have the key or can crack the case open. That is great if you are preventing the information from slipping into the wrong hands but also  means  that  nearly  all  of  the  information  streaming  past  your other security measures cannot be checked for its contents. This is covered further in the next chapter.  The  other  big  problem  is  that  encryption  does  not  last.  It  is  okay  if you  want  to  keep  something  secure  that  is  not  time  sensitive. However, all encryption can eventually be broken, given enough time and resource. Encryption that is nearly impossible to break today will be relatively easy to break in ten years time.  Encryption  is  still  a  vital  part  of  our  security  toolset.  It  prevents information  from  being  immediately  vulnerable  if  it  is  intercepted during communications.  Proxy servers:  proxy server – is a program used to provide intermediate services between  a  requested  transaction  and  its  destination.  Instead  of sending the transaction ‘as is’ it can adjust some of the information to  help  secure  the  anonymity  of  the  sender.  In  addition,  it  may store  cache  any information that is accessed often to help speed up response times.   The  primary  security  role  of  a  proxy  server  is  to  help  keep information  about  the  sender  or  requestor  hidden  or  secret,  to prevent that information from being misused. For example, when you request a page on the internet, instead of revealing your name and exact  computer  details,  the  proxy  server  can  substitute  other information.  When  the  response  to  the  request  is  received,  it  can then seamlessly direct that information back to you.  Proxy servers help by keeping exact information about locations and users in a network hidden.  Attackers also use proxy servers for the same reason.  Identity and Access Controls:  identity  and  access  controls  –the  method s  of  regulating  how each  person  and  computer  service  is  confirmed  to  be  who  they claim  to  be   authentication   and  how  their  permissions  are regulated.  Knowing  if  each  transaction  of  information  is  legitimate  is  simpler when  the  identity  of  the  requestor  and  their  permission  to  do  what they are requesting can be easily confirmed.  The larger the number of different identity and access systems that are  managed,  the  greater  the  opportunity  will  be  for  them  to  be attacked.  As  part  of  most  security  strategies,  a  security  architect  will  usually aim to use a single primary technology to control identity and high- level  access  rights  across  the  entire  digital  landscape  of  an enterprise.  This  allows  all  access  for  each  person  to  be  easily  changed  or revoked.  It  also  provides  easier  identification  of  any  attempts  to fraudulently enter the account.   Usually, each separate username and password indicates the use of a  separate  identity  management  system.  The  more  of  these  there are, the greater the likelihood of systems being compromised without being noticed.  Secure, identity management systems can now use processes that allow even external systems to use a single, central username and password without the need to share password information back with the external system.  Although  access  permissions  are  largely  a  procedural  control,  for example, ensuring that each person is assigned the least amount of privilege  they  require  to  perform  their  duties,  there  is  a  technical aspect.  Access  rights  are  administered  and  enforced  through  applications and systems.  Similarly,  by  centrally  tracking  privilege  levels  across  different systems,  or  enforcing  privilege  restrictions  from  a  central  location, attempts  to  break  business  rules  on  access  can  more  easily  be identified.  Penetration testing:  penetration test  also known as an attack and penetration test or  pen.  test   –  checks  and  scans  on  any  application,  system  or website to identify any potential security gaps  vulnerabilities  that could  be  exploited.  Usually  these  checks  emulate  the  same techniques that could be used by an attacker and are performed in a  test  area.  This  is  to  prevent  any  inadvertent  operational disruption.  The  checks  are  typically  conducted  before  any application or site is first used and also on a periodic  repeating  basis, for example, each time the program is updated or every 6 months.  Any  significant  gaps  must  be  addressed   fixed   in  a timeframe appropriate to the scale of the risk.   vulnerability –   in  the  context  of  cybersecurity   a  weakness  that could be compromised and result in damage or harm.  There are a significant number of potential security gaps that can be present  inside  each  computer  program.  These  programs  are represented on our attack surface by applications and systems,  The  only  way  to  check  for  the  presence  of  these  vulnerabilities  is through  a  process  referred  to  as  penetration  testing.  This  can either  uses  ethical  hackers  that  your  enterprise  pays  to  manually check if they can identify security weaknesses, or automated tools to run through and check for all known compromises. White-box  penetration  testing   also  known  as  clear  box  testing   is the  term  used  to  describe  a  situation  where  the  technical  layout  of the computer program being tested has been made available for the penetration test. This makes the test easier and cheaper to perform but usually results in the identification of more issues than black-box testing. Black-box penetration testing is the term used to describe a situation where  the  penetration  testers  are  given  no  advance  information about the technical details of a computer program. Although this is usually  a  more  accurate  reflection  of  a  true  attack   unless  the attackers managed to get a copy of the technical details , it is more expensive and usually less effective at locating all potential security vulnerabilities.  Any  significant  gaps  identified  during  penetration  testing   or  at  any other  time   must  be  fixed.  Usually  this  is  before  putting  a  program into real world use. If a gap is identified in a program that is already in real world use, the corrective approach will depend on comparing the risk and cost if the vulnerability is exploited with the cost to the business  of  the  disruption  an  interim  suspension  of  the  program would cause   Vulnerability assessment:  vulnerability assessment – the process of identifying, quantifying and assessing the susceptibilities present. This can be applied to individual  computer  programs,  any  part  of  the  attack  surface,  or any group of attack surface components. port  scanning  –  a  process,  usually  run  by  computer,  to  detect open  access  points   ports   that  could  be  used  to  infiltrate  or exfiltrate electronic information into or out of an enterprise.  testing   is  one  method  of   Although  penetration  identifying vulnerabilities,  there  are  many  others.  Keeping  up  to  date  with industry  notifications  about  new  vulnerabilities  is  one  way.  Running frequent or continuous port scanning is another example. Knowing  what  potential  vulnerabilities  exist  is  only  part  of  the process.  It  is  important  to  follow  through  and  close  or  otherwise mitigate those potential gaps in an appropriate priority order.  Collectively,  all  of  the  above  form  the  current  primary  methods  of technical  protection  of  electronic  devices  and  the  information  they process, store and transact.  The speed that we adopt new technologies means that attackers are seeking new and more ingenious methods to breach these defenses.  One major method not yet covered is the use of security coordination programs to bring together intelligence about threats.  Now  is  a  good  time  to  look  at  how  the  threats  and  attacks  are evolving  and  how  we  can  take  steps  to  counteract  these  new exploits.   9.  Evolving Attack and Defense Methods In  the  previous  chapter,  the  most  substantial,  primary,  traditional methods of preventing and detecting attack were reviewed at a basic level.  Each one of those defenses can be the subject of more detailed and specialist  study.  Depending  on  your  personal  and  professional interest,  you  may  want  to  read  more  about  one  or  more  of  those technical defenses.  As  a  beginner’s  text,  our  objective  is  to  provide  a  basic,  overall understanding of the subject area. That means that we need to take a  step  to  an  even  higher  level  to  review  how  attack  and  defense methods are evolving.  Firstly, as we covered in earlier chapters, the only way to be effective at  preventing  unwanted  intrusion  or  misuse  of  electronics  and  the information they contain is to take a more holistic approach than only looking at technical controls.  As  an  example,  the  UK  Cyber  Essentials  scheme,  one  of  many frameworks  designed  to  help  organizations  create  better  defenses, believes  that  effective  management  of  just  five  key  areas  would protect against 80% of attacks. These areas are:    Effective firewall positioning and management.   Secure configuration.   User Access Controls.   Malware Protection.   Timely Patch Management.  secure configuration – ensuring that when settings are applied to any item  device or software , appropriate steps are always taken to ensure  i  default accounts are removed or disabled,  ii  shared   accounts are not used and  iii  all protective and defensive control in the item use the strongest appropriate settings. default accounts – generic user and password permissions, often with  administrative  access  that  is  provided  as  standard  for  some applications and hardware for use during initial set-up.  tokens   access controls –the ability to control entry or exit to a physical, virtual  or  digital  area  through  the  use  of  permissions  issued  at  a personal,  electronic  or  physical  level.  The  permissions  can  be issued  as  physical   something  you  have ,  secret information  something you know  or biometric information – using part of the human body such as a fingerprint or eye scan to gain also  multi-factor access  authentication. patch management –a controlled process used to deploy critical, interim  updates  to  software  on  digital  devices.  The  release  of  a software ‘patch’ is usually in response to a critical flaw or gap that has been identified.  are .  See    something   you   What  is  noticeable  in  the  list  above  is  that  the  three  bolded  items  secure  configuration,  user  access  controls  and  timely  patch management ,  are  reliant  on  human  procedures.  These  are  not direct  technical  controls  but  are  process  controls  that  need  to  be applied to networks, systems, devices and applications.  In  each  of  the  case  studies,  it  is  never  a  single  technical  failure  in isolation that results in the loss.  For that reason, there is an increasing use of security coordination software.   Security coordination software is designed to bring together a fuller picture  of  the  status  of  different  security  controls.  However,  it  is important to note that just like zooming in and out on a map; there are many different levels available.  the  highest   At  compliance system is designed to pull together:  level,  an  enterprise  governance,  risk  and    Governance  information  -  is  the  full  range  of  policies, procedures and specific controls that the executive of an enterprise  use  to  keep  their  organization  working  within acceptable  boundaries.  This  will  include  direct  security policies,  procedures  and  controls  and  also  indirect  items that can also influence or impact security.    Compliance information – are the results from processes used to verify that governance items are being followed and to identify any gaps.    Risk  information  –  is  anything  that  has  a  possibility  to substantially and materially impact the organization. This data  can  come  from  multiple  sources,  including  not  only identified  gaps  in  compliance  but  also  any  new  threats  such as changes in regulation or new types of exploits .  Although  collecting  and  synchronizing  this  highest  level  information is the best source of creating an informed view of the overall security position, it relies on being able to pull information from more granular sources of security coordination software. Network  operations  centers  often  pull  together  information  about information traffic and attempts at intrusion.  Anti-malware coordination suites can monitor assets to ensure their individual  anti-malware  software  is  functioning,  being  updated  and collect information about attempted infection rates.   Corrective  and  preventive  action  systems  can  operate  to  measure, manage and monitor identified problems through to closure.  There are more than 30 different security control processes that can aggregate information.  Although all levels of security can be important, if we look at the case studies, it is usually the inability to understand the really big picture that is most likely to create sufficient gaps to allow a major breach of cyber security. Due to defense in depth techniques, it is unlikely that a single gap on its own will result in a major loss.  Before we look at even more defense methods, we should consider how the attacks themselves are evolving. Evolving Attack Methods: Many  people  still  think  that  getting  malware  into  their  system  is achieved through email or by intentionally downloading an unknown application on to a device. One of the earliest techniques used was known as phishing.  phishing – using an electronic communication  for example email or  instant  messaging   that  pretends  to  come  from  a  legitimate source,  in  an  attempt  to  get  sensitive  information   for  example  a password or credit card number  from the recipient.  An  evolved  version  of  this  technique  became  known  as  spear phishing.  spear  phishing  –  a  more  targeted  from  of  phishing.  This  term describes  the  use  of  an  electronic  communication   for  example email  or  instant  messaging   that  targets  a  particular  person  or group  of  people   for  example  employees  at  a  location   and pretends to come from a legitimate source. In this case, the source   may  also  pretend  to  be  someone  known  and  trusted  to  the recipient, in an attempt to get sensitive information  for example a password or credit card number .  Although those are still valid methods, they no longer make up the majority of paths to infection.  Malware  can  now  be  unintentionally  downloaded  simply  by  clicking on a single internet link. Even when the user lacks the permission to install software on their device, most malware is able to circumvent this control and install anyway.  To  increase  the  chances  of  success,  attackers  often  make  use  of major  social  media  sites  and  popular  web  services.  Facebook, Twitter, Ebay and more can all carry links inserted by their users. If an attacker can make the link interesting enough to click on, then the malware can get in place.  A further issue is that these social media and web service sites can often not be blocked. They often form an essential tool that at least some  of  the  business  requires  to  communicate  or  connect  with customers.  These  sites  also  make  use  of  secure,  encrypted  protocols  such  as SSL,  to  avoid  their  content  being  intercepted.  This  allows  any information  sent  or  received,  including  any  malware,  difficult  to detect or prevent through usual security devices.  SSL – is an acronym for Secure Sockets Layer. This is a method  protocol  for providing encrypted communication between a web server   the  computer  hosting  a  web  service  or  web  site   and  a web browser  the program that the recipient uses to view the web page- for example, Internet Explorer .   File  sharing  and  instant  messaging  services  are  also  able  to  be exploited in the same way. This form of attack is referred to as a drive-by download.  drive-by  download  –  the  unintended  receiving  of  malicious software  on  to  a  device  through  an  internet  page,  electronic service or link.  There  is  also  a  further  advance  that  creates  increased  difficulty  in sustaining an effective defense.  Anti-malware software can only be effective when it knows what to look for. Attackers know this. They will often customize or adjust their malware  so  that  it  is  sufficiently  different  not  to  be  immediately detected. It will only be after an instance of the new version of the malware  is  discovered,  isolated,  submitted  to  the  anti-malware experts, decrypted, analyzed and finally has a defense added as an update  to  the  anti-malware  software  that  it  may  be  discovered. Depending  on  how  exotic   unusual  and  rare   the  malware  is,  this defense process could take months or years.  Malicious  software  that  is  subject  to  frequent  adaption  to  more effectively evade anti-malware is known as polymorphic malware.  polymorphic  malware  –malicious  software  that  can  change  its attributes  to  help  avoid  detection  by  anti-malware.  This  mutation process  can  be  automated  so  that  the  function  of  the  software continues but the method of operation, location and other attributes may change.  A further significant but often overlooked area of compromise is the presence of USB connection ports on most hardware devices.   USB  –acronym  for  Universal  Serial  Bus.  This  is  a  standard connector  that  exists  on  most  computers,  smartphones,  tablets and  other  physical  electronic  devices  that  allow  other  electronic devices  to  be  connected.  Used  for  attaching  a  range  of  devices including keyboards, mice, external displays, printers and external storage.  Many forms of data loss prevention security programs and hardware configuration  can  seek  to  disable  or  limit  access  to  this  port; however,  hardware  with  malicious  content  is  usually  built  to circumvent security measures. For example, USB connections may be  limited  to  keyboards  and  mice,  however,  a  piece  of  malicious hardware  may  be  programmed  to  appear  as  a  keyboard  or  mouse but  in  reality  can  contain  malware.  Direct  physical  connection  to  a device  that  already  has  access  inside  your  network  will  already  be positioned beyond several layers of security.  Unlike  devices  connected  directly  to  your  network,  infiltration  using infected  USB  devices  offers  attackers  the  opportunity  to  get  inside the attack surface without the need to directly seek network access permission.  This form of attack does require physical access to a device but this can  be  achieved  through  intentional  use  by  a  rogue  insider,  or unintentional  use  by  gifting  infected  devices  to  targeted  employees or suppliers.  Exact  statistics  on  the  amount  of  malware  on  USB  devices  vary according  to  the  measurement  methods  used.  It  is  the  case  that  a significant minority of all USB devices are carrying malware.  It is always worth checking on the latest statistics on cyber attacks. At  the  time  of  writing  the  first  edition  of  the  book,  up  to  71%  of attacks are focused on 3 primary targets:   1  Point of Sale  POS  Systems. 2  Cyber Espionage  including theft of intellectual property . 3  Web based applications and services.  96% of crime is believed to leverage what is referred to as the dark web.  dark  web  –websites  that  hide  their  server  locations.  Although publicly  accessible,  they  are  not  registered  on  standard  search engines and the hidden server values make it extremely difficult to locate what organizations and people are behind the site.  Dark  web  locations  are  used  for  all  kinds  of  illegal  activities.  This includes  selling  stolen  data  and  exchanging  other  illegal  forms  of information. They also use covert encryption tools to help hide their user details.  Whenever  you  look  at  a  cybersecurity  statistic,  it  is  always  worth verifying its validity. How recent is it? Is the person or party delivering the message trying to sell something  could it be bias?   The extent and continuing growth of mobile computing also requires consideration.  Already,  over  half  of  all  internet  traffic  is  processed using  some  form  of  mobile  device.  That  trend  is  continuing.  This makes  mobile  and  other  internet  connected  devices  that  are  not traditional computers or laptops a particular target. Evolving Defense Methods: Given  the  scale  and  sophistication  of  attacks,  it  can  seem  to  be nearly impossible to create effective defenses. This is not the case.  As  attacks  become  more  sophisticated,  defenses  too  are  being strengthened.  The main change that can be seen is that defense methods are now often being combined and also placed in more locations.   For  example,  firewalls  used  to  be  deployed  only  at  network perimeters  but  personal  firewalls  are  now  found  on  individual devices.  As  a  further  example,  firewalls  are  now  usually  combined  with intrusion detection and prevention software. The legacy functions of firewall port blocking are no longer thought to be sufficiently secure on their own.  There are also technical traps that can be set to help capture, trace and prosecute attackers. Honeypots and honey networks are two examples  of  setting  up  false  areas  that  can  look  like  sensitive  and valuable parts of the attack surface but contain nothing of value and in  fact  are  intentionally  used  to  lure,  identify  and  trace  would  be attackers and their malware.  honeypot  –  an  electronic  device  or  collection  of  data  that  is designed  to  trap  would  be  attackers  by  detecting,  deflecting  or otherwise  counteracting  their  efforts.  Designed  to  look  like  a  real part  of  an  enterprises  attack  surface,  the  honeypot  will  contain nothing of real value to the attacker but will contain tools to identify, isolate and trace any intrusion. honey network – the collective name for a cluster of honeypots that  operate  together  to  help  form  part  of  a  network  intrusion detection strategy.  There  are  also  a  number  of  non-technical  strategies  that  can significantly decrease the potential for attack.  Although there can be significant value to collecting large amounts of information, we often keep a lot of information that is of limited or low value active in the network. This is mostly due to the low cost of data storage  and  the  perception  that  the  information  will  be  of  greater value to keep than to discard. This is often not the case.   Having  strong  and  well  through  data  retention  and destruction policies that consider the cost of security as part of the business case can help to ensure that data is only kept active and available when there is a justification.  thought   Email is a great example of this principle.  lawyers  approach  a  case,   When  find  single communications that indicate wrong-doing than it is to re-assemble the full structured set of data that proves otherwise.  is  easier   to   it   If employees and other users of email systems understand that their communications  are  automatically  deleted  after,  for  example,  3 months  unless  specifically  stored  to  an  archive  system,  then  the exposure is lower.  Similarly,  even  if  there  are  legal  or  business  requirements  to  keep information stored, it is valid to understand if the storage has to be live and active or can be in an offline format.  These  measures  help  to  reduce  the  attack  surface  and  focus security efforts.  It should also be considered that zones with very high security can be created to add substantially more protection to the most sensitive data.  Just  like  a  high  security  site,  it  can  be  a  requirement  for  this area to either be a closed system, or for all inbound and outbound traffic to be fully decrypted and inspected.  closed system – a collection of applications, systems and devices that  only  have  the  ability  to  communicate  with  each  other.  No connection to any component outside the known and trusted group is permitted.  Closed systems are frequently used, for example, in manufacturing lines and in aircraft control.   To summarize, it is possible to form highly effective defenses against attacks.    The  most  critical  item  is  to  have  executive   board  level  support  for  the  correct  investment  into  security.  That requires  presenting  the  executive  with  a  clear understanding of the size and scale of the organizations risk  exposure.  This  is  covered  in  greater  detail  in Chapters 12 & 13.    Reduce  the  attack  surface  to  the  minimum  appropriate  size to meet the business needs.    Use  a  security  architect  to  help  simplify  your  range  of  cyber defense points.    Classify  your  information  to  know  what  sets  of  data  require the greatest amount of security control.    Zone  your  attack  surface  into  discrete  segments  that reflect  the  value  and  sensitivity  of  the  information  they transact. Apply the greatest security to the highest value zones.    Remove  or  destroy  data  that  has  insignificant  or  low  value.    Use up to date anti-malware across all devices that carry,  store or transact your information.    Ensure  that  you  have  strong  user  access  controls  that work  on  the  basis  of  providing  people  with  the  lowest amount of privilege they require to perform their role.    Patch all devices and operating systems promptly with the  latest security updates from their manufacturers.    Deploy  other,  key,  technical  countermeasures  such  as advanced firewalls with strong policies to critical locations.   Make  sure  the  security  settings  on  all  applications, systems and physical devices are set to an appropriately high level and remove all default accounts.   But  most  importantly  –  remember  that  defense  in  depth  requires  a holistic  view  of  security.  Physical  security,  procedural  controls  and cultural  conditions  are  key  contributors  to  the  most  significant  and successful attacks. Only  organizations  with  an  informed  view  of  the  full  picture  will  be able to prevent substantial attacks.  investment   The  primary  challenge  to  create  effective  defense  is  achieving sufficient  in  securing  electronic  devices.  Creating investment requires building an effective business case  justification for the expense  and with the number of successful attacks making headlines  and  creating  enormous  losses,  the  value  of  improved security over electronic devices and their data will be relatively easy to demonstrate.  Effective  security  over  electronic  devices  and  their  information requires an expensive and extensive approach that is championed at the board level.  Ineffective  security  is  even  more  expensive.  Under  investment  in security  is  now  frequently  leading  to  the  dismissal  of  key  board members who were poorly informed about the cyber risks they were allowing their organization to take.   10.  Case Study – Sony  2014   Organization s :  Sony  Breach Dates:  Unknown to unknown  Date of Discovery:  24th November 2014  Date of Disclosure:  24th November 2014  Nature of the Breach:  Sensitive emails, unreleased films, employee data, . …  Scale of the Breach:  Believed to be in excess of 100 Terabytes.  Estimated > $300m  Impact:    Summary:  As  a  very  large  company,  highly  reliant  on  technology,  Sony  had frequently been the target for cyber attacks in the past.  To  provide  flexibility  for  their  different  divisions,  Sony  operated  a flexible  approach  to  the  security  of  their  systems,  allowing  each group of companies to implement and manage what they required, at the same time as having some overall systems that operated across all divisions.  This approach has the advantage of allowing the different divisions to deliver new technologies that help expand and deliver to customer needs and in turn increase revenues.  This strategy can work well, but is much higher cost to run than top- down  security  enforcement.  When  running  security  separately  for each  division,  it  is  vital  to  know  what  the  responsibilities  and boundaries are for each section. Adequate funding must be in place, sufficient  to  enable  each  division  to  manage  a  comprehensive   approach  to  security,  including  all  of  the  components  we  have explored in this book.  On Friday 21st November, a small number of Sony Executive email accounts received a communication from a group calling themselves ‘God’sApstls’  demanding  monetary  compensation  to  prevent  Sony ‘being bombarded as a whole.’ This communication is understood to have mostly been ignored, or treated as spam.  On  Monday  24th  November  2014,  Sony  Pictures  Entertainment,  a division of the Sony Corporation, discovered a significant number of their systems had been compromised. A substantial amount of data had already been taken and a number of critical services were taken out of action. The exact causes and infiltration points were unknown.  The first reports of the attack being detected were when employee computer  screens  at  Sony  Pictures  Entertainment  headquarters  in Culver  City,  started  to  flash  with  a  message  from  the  hackers.  The message  included  links  to  some  of  the  stolen  data  they  had collected.  At  this  time  the  attackers  identified  themselves  as  the ‘Guardians of Peace.’  On  the  same  day,  information  about  the  breach  spread  quickly through social media.  Some  of  the  stolen  data  had  been  posted  online  and  the  media began to examine the contents.  The extent of the attack and the time it takes to identify the method of attack created a significant impact on immediate Sony operations. Even  many  days  later,  Sony  employees  around  the  world  were allegedly continuing to work without the use of their computers, email or voicemail.  Over the following weeks, more and more stolen data continued to be  posted  online,  together  with  threats  and  demands  from  the attackers.   The  extent  of  the  breach  was  enormous.  Data  posted  online included:    Entire email archives from senior executives.    Information  on  some  employees,  including  payroll  and social security numbers.    Unreleased films.   Company financial information.   …  The  list  of  the  types  of  information  the  attackers  exposed  could  be continued for several pages. Initial information about the leak from the attackers  the Guardians of Peace   in  November  indicated  they  had  managed  to  take  over  12 terabytes of information.  Indications are that despite the knowledge of the attack, the malware in use was able to continue working for some time. Final indications put the amount of data removed at over 100 terabytes. To put that figure into perspective, the entire US Library of Congress can fit into 10% of that size.  Sony took measures to get the stolen data blocked and removed.  This  ongoing  exfiltration  of  information  indicated  that  the  malware was  polymorphic   as  outlined  in  the  previous  chapter   and  at  the time, unable to be blocked or quarantined by existing anti-malware.  However, it was not only the anti-malware software defense that was being bypassed. The security team was also unable to immediately block or prevent the ongoing outflow of information from the malware through  other  security  means  available  at  the  time.  Usual  security countermeasures  would  include  firewalls  that  should  be  able  to  be completely closed in an emergency situation if necessary.   The  level  of  sensitivity  of  the  information  being  stolen  was  mixed, with  benign   relatively  harmless   data  frequently  existing  alongside small pockets of highly sensitive information.  Indications  were  that  the  attack  was  politically  motivated  by  the upcoming release of a film called ‘The Interview.’  Sony  engaged  external  security  companies  to  assist  with  efforts  to block and remove the exposed data and also to help restore internal systems and services.  The  magnitude  of  the  attack  also  led  US  government  agencies  to assist.  On  the  19th  December,  the  US  Computer  Emergency  Response Team  posted  information  about  a  new  type  of  destructive  malware that had recently been used to attack a major media company.  https:  www.us-cert.gov ncas alerts TA14-353A  In the analysis of the malware, it was confirmed to have a significant set  of  capabilities  listen,  access,  command  and  destroy information  on  the  victim  devices  it  is  hosted  on.  The  malware  is described as a worm.  to   worm – a form of malicious software  malware  that seeks to find other locations that it can replicate to. This assists to both protect the  malware  from  removal  and  increase  the  area  of  the  attack surface that is compromised.  It  worked  by  leveraging  a  standard  file  sharing  protocol  called  a sever  message  block  or  SMB.  This  approach  had  been  used  in other  attacks  and  a  number  of  patches  were  available  that  helped address this vulnerability. The ability for the malware to also delete information means that it is also referred to as a ‘wiper’.   The  financial  impact,  including  loss  of  revenues,  disruption  to operations,  costs  for  remediation  and  compensation  payments  are still ongoing at the time of writing this book. They are expected to be very  deeply  in  to  a  figure  of  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars,  if  not higher.  The  scale,  magnitude  and  outstripped the cyber security capabilities that Sony had in place.  this  attack  completely  impact  of   Root Cause Analysis:  The  possibility  of  a  large  and  diverse  attack  on  Sony  or  the  Sony Pictures  Entertainment  division  had  never  been  adequately considered or prepared for.  When  Sony  Pictures  produced  a  film  that  offended  an  insulated, sensitive and reactionary nation state, Sony added a substantial and powerful adversary to the list of attackers who would be interested in infiltrating their systems.  Unlike other attackers, where the motive would usually be primarily financial,  a  state  sponsored  attack  can  include  very  different objectives.  The  foundation  to  an  adequate  cyber  security,  defense  in  depth strategy relies on executive visibility of the extent of the risks and a holistic understanding of the level of exposure.  A key root cause, based on the extent of the infiltration and damage caused,  indicates  that  there  were  a  large  number  of  gaps  in  the defense layers.  involving  polymorphic  malware  are  nearly Although  attacks  impossible  to  fully  protect  against,  the  malware  itself  mostly leverages exploits that are already known. That means that although an attack using polymorphic malware can create damage, the scale   and  impact  can  be  substantially  reduced  when  all  other  security measures are operating effectively.  As  we  covered  in  the  last  chapter,  putting  hardened,  defense  in depth in place is expensive.  Evolving  methods  of  attack  need  to  be  regularly  considered  and countered. Defenses need to be regularly and appropriately updated.  Although  speculation  has  continued  about  whether  or  not  it  really was instigated by North Korea, a few key facts indicate this to be the case.  The  type  of  software  used  to  infiltrate  Sony,  although  modified  to help it evade anti-malware was very similar to an earlier attack made on  South  Korea  in  March  2013.  That  attack  was  also  attributed  to North Korea.  In addition, having infiltrated and copied unreleased films from Sony, the  attackers,  who  referred  to  themselves  as  the  ‘Guardians  of Peace’, posted those films online, except for ’The Interview’, the film that had offended the North Korean government.  The  initial  infiltration  was  tracked  back  to  the  St.  Regis  Bangkok hotel in Thailand.  It is believed that the malware may have been present within Sony systems, undetected, for some time prior to the date that the attack was revealed. This is because the amount of data that was collected and taken would have been considered extremely difficult to achieve in a time span of less than several months.  The  malware  used  exploits   specific  techniques   that  had  been known for some time. Software manufacturers had released patches  updates  that would assist in minimizing these exploits. Parts of the attack surface that did not have recent updates would have been at greater risk than parts that did.   Analysis  of  the  information  that  was  exposed  indicated  that  there was little to no record retention and destruction procedure in place, at  least  for  email  systems.  Automatically  removing  and  destroying email  after  a  specific,  short  time  period,  unless  it  is  explicitly earmarked for retention would have substantially reduced the impact of the data exposure.  In  other  words,  the  size  and  sensitivity  of  the  attack  surface  was larger and more vulnerable than it needed to be.  Additionally,  the  attackers  were  able  to  locate  some  sensitive  data alongside  non-sensitive  data.  This  information classification processes were not fully in place. Sensitive information was  not  consistently  separated  and  subject  to  higher  security measures than non-sensitive data.  indicated   that   The  amount  of  data  that  was  taken  indicated  that  data  loss prevention  tools  at  network  and  device  level  was  ineffective,  either bypassed or absent.

Part of the rationale for this accusation is that the extent of the damage and infiltration would be more rationally explained if the attackers had a reasonable understanding of Sony systems, their network  locations  and  vulnerability  points  to  assist  in  their  attack strategy.  from  disaffected   In summary, Sony did not have the scale of defense in depth security controls in place to manage the threat that materialized. They did not sufficiently  anticipate  or  prepare  for  an  attack  to  be  able  to  impact them on this scale.   One  of  the  key  features  in  all  good  security  is  single  point accountability.  single point  of  accountability –  abbreviation SPA or SPOA  is the  requirement  to  have  an  individual  owner  identified  for  the protection  of  each  process  or  asset  where  a  failure  can  create substantial impact. The rationale is that the absence of a defined, single  owner  is  a  frequent  cause  of  process  or  asset  protection failure.  At the beginning of this book was the statement ‘ Nobody ever made a statue to honor a committee.’  Operating  a  divisional  approach  to  security  can  work,  but  requires clear  and  accountable  lines  of  single  point  accountability  to  be defined.

Each day, hundreds of millions of attempts are made to gain unauthorized access into digital devices and accounts.  Some of these attempts are opportunist, some are targeted but all of them have the purpose of creating political or financial gain over the rightful organizations and people that these assets belong to.  The  increase  in  the  number  of  attempts  and  the  cost  of  the consequences  is  both  a  cause  of  great  concern  and  a  driver  to improve the security and defenses.  As with any war, strategists need to know their enemy. Who are the organizations  and  people  that  want  to  target  our  digital  landscape, what  are  their  goals,  how  sophisticated  are  they  and  how  do  they operate?  The  cyber  attackers  can  broadly  be  considered  to  consist  of  8 different groups.  1. Nation States 2. Terrorist Groups 3. Organized Criminal Groups 4. Hacktivist Communities  Hacktivism  5. Skilled Professional Hackers 6. Disaffected or Opportunist Insiders 7. Amateur Hackers & Journalists 8. Anyone  Every organizations threatscape is different. According to what you or your organization does, you can become more or less attractive to one or more of these groups.   hacktivism – an amalgamation of hacker and activism. Describes any  group  that  uses  subversive  techniques  through  digital  or electronic  means  to  promote  a  political  agenda.  See  also hacktivist. hacktivist – an amalgamation of the words hacker  and  activist. Describes any individual who operates either independently or as part  of  a  group  to  use  subversive  techniques  through  digital  or electronic means to serve a political or social cause that they may see as serving a broader interest.  threatscape –a term that amalgamates threat and landscape. An umbrella term to describe the overall, expected methods  vectors  and  types  of  cyber  attackers  that  an  organization  or  individual might expect to be attacked through or by.  The size, scale and public profile of your digital presence will also be a key factor in determining who attacks you and how often.  In 2015, most household cybersecurity is very poor. This is because individual households, unless they contain somebody high profile or high  value  will  often  be  too  low  value  to  warrant  the  attention  of cyber attackers.  This will change quickly.  The level of effort and sophistication required for a cyber attacker to make a gain from any cyber attack is decreasing fast. As the effort decreases,  more  and  more  households  will  also  become  prone  to attack  and  begin  to  need  to  invest  in  greater  and  greater  levels  of cybersecurity.  The attraction of attacking private households will also increase with the  growing  trend  to  connect  more  and  more,  everyday  household   and  other  general  electronics  to  each  other.  This  is  known  as  the Internet of Things.  Internet  of  Things   IoT   –  the  incorporation  of  electronics  into everyday items that allows them to be connected to each other.  One of the primary issues with successful cyber attacks is that unlike a  physical  battle,  the  attacker  does  not  need  to  be  of  a  significant size  or  sophistication  to  inflict  a  great  deal  of  damage.  Even  when the  group  behind  an  attack  is  large  and  organized,  the  number  of people required for a devastating attack can be as low as one.  The  cost  to  reward  ratio  for  any  cyber  criminal  is  so  high,  many  of the groups are investing heavily to increase their inventory of skills and  tools  to  leverage  our  dependence  on  technology  for  their  own gain.  A further significant factor is that it has become easier for any person with relatively little knowledge to download and use tools to attempt cyber  attacks  without  the  need  for  much  subject  knowledge.  The only upside for cybersecurity defense groups is that amateur hackers usually upload a lot of malware with their tools, are then open to a lot of abuse and extortion themselves and are usually very easy to trace after the attempt.  We  will  now  look  more  closely  at  each  of  the  groups  that  conduct cyber attacks to better understand their motives and targets. Nation States: Countries  have  engaged  Technology has moved espionage to a new level.  throughout  history.  in  espionage   The  former  German  Democratic  Republic   GDR  or  East  Germany  had possibly the most developed internal espionage network of any country  in  history.  Official  figures  indicate  that  their  secret  police,   called  the  ‘Stasi’  had  approximately  1  in  every  20  adult  citizens  as either  an  employee  or  an  informant.  I  spoke  with  a  former  Stasi informant. He believed the figure was in fact much higher than that, possibly as high as 1 in 5.  Before  technology  was  available,  monitoring  the  activities  of  large numbers of people used to involve a huge amount of cost and effort. In  the  case  of  the  Stasi,  it  was  estimated  that  there  were  around 274,000 people on the payroll.  Modern technologies allow similar strategies to be managed at much lower cost. It is no longer required for a large number of people to be used to monitor communications. Technologies can be programmed to ‘spy’ on all communications, spoken or written and create a flag or alert  whenever  particular  words  or  phrases  are  used,  or  when particular people communicate.  Large scale monitoring focuses mainly on intelligence gathering. The more significant threat from sovereign states is the potential for them to  more  profoundly  infiltrate  and  leverage  the  critical  information  or infrastructure of other countries.  The  motivations  for  nation  state  sponsored  cyber  attacks  can  be summarized as follows:    The  acquisition  of  intelligence  to  prevent  attacks  and  to  exert influence.    The  theft  of  intellectual  property  to  understand  enemy towards  information   leverage   the  capabilities  and  domestic political or financial gains.    The  ability  to  exert  control  over  any  foreign  or  domestic enemy  through  their  digital  landscape.  For  example,  by having  the  ability  to  remotely  disable  critical  enemy technologies and services.  According to sources in the US security community, the nation states with the highest capability are:   1  United States & China in equal first place. China  has  enormous  cyber  intelligence  and  penetration capabilities.  They  tend  to  be  passively  used  to  gather information  and  intellectual  property.  They  do  not  tend  to  be destructive in their techniques, however this approach makes detection  harder  and  their  capability  to  perform  sudden  and immense damage through their infiltration work much greater than any other country. The United States is the most cyber attacked country on the planet.  It  has  developed,  probably,  the  best  defensive  cyber strategies  in  the  world  as  a  result.  It  also  has  considerable infiltration capabilities. As an example, in early 2015, a group of hackers called ‘The Equation’  alleged  to  be  linked  to  the  US  National  Security Agency were behind a new style of malware that penetrates the  low  level  programming  of  many  major  hard  disk  brands. The approach is so advanced that at the time, traditional anti- malware  and  even  fully  re-formatting  the  drives  cannot remove  it.  However,  it  has  only  been  located  in  specific institutions  that  would  largely  correlate  with  US  government interests. 2  Russia Russia  has  increased  their  focus  on  cyber  intelligence  in recent  years.  Unlike  China,  Russian  infiltration  techniques allegedly do tend to be intentionally more noticeable. If this is true, this makes them easier to identify but more expensive to correct.  They  are  also  leading  exponents  of  ‘hybrid  warfare’ where  cyber  attacks  are  used  in  combination  with  other subversive techniques to create national power and territorial advantages  at  the  expense  of  other  nation’s  safety  and security. 3  Israel   the UK and France are positioned in equal fourth  place.   they  can  exert   through  effective  cyber   North  Korea  is  also  worthy  of  a  mention.  Although  they  have  very limited  internet  access,  they  have  realized  how  much  power  and influence  infiltration techniques.  The  Sony  cybersecurity  breach  in  late  2014  is  a  great example of this. It  is  hard  to  get  any  reliable  information  on  the  scale  of  state sponsored  cyber  warfare.  For  obvious  reasons  both  attacking  and defending  states  do  not  want  to  reveal  what  they  do  or  what  they know.  It is clear that all countries are spending a lot of time and money to step up both their defensive and offensive capabilities.  There is also a growing amount of cooperation between allied states to share information about new and emerging threats.  Countries do not only focus their work on other countries, they also infiltrate  any  significant  organizations  that  can  be  useful  to  them. Google, Microsoft, Apple, humanitarian organizations, infrastructure services,  even  major  banks  have  to  defend  their  systems  from intrusion by some nation states.  Many nation state ‘employees’ are not averse to making money on the  side  as  a  peripheral  benefit  from  their  activities.  They  may  find information that is not useful to their state but if they can earn some money from it on another market, they may well do it. Terrorist Groups: Terrorist  groups  have  three  main  motives  when  it  comes  to  cyber attacks.  1  To raise funds. 2  To create a negative impact within their enemies. 3  To raise their profile.   One  of  the  attractions  that  cyber  attacks  have  for  these  groups  is that they can potentially create a lot of damage, using relatively small numbers of resources. A terrorist group only has to identify a single chain of weaknesses to be successful. Conversely, their enemy has to sustain cyber defenses across a much wider territory. Although  some  terrorists  may  try  and  portray  themselves  as hacktivism  groups,  there  is  a  key  behavioral  difference.  Terrorist groups,  although  they  may  have  political  goals,  will  use  organized, anti-society crime to achieve their goals. Running scams to defraud people  and  other  institutions  to  achieve  financial  gain  is  a  major source of revenue for some of these groups. Organized Criminal Groups: The  motivation  behind  any  organized  criminal  group  is  very  clear. Money.  That financial gain can be direct or indirect.  Stealing and re-using credit card information, or accessing a banking system and moving funds are examples of direct methods to create financial gain.  Acquiring  information  that  allows  blackmail  or  other  forms  of extortion are examples of indirect but still effective financial gain.  These  methods  are  also  used  by  other  hackers.  A  key  difference between  an  individual  hacker  and  the  use  of  cyber  attacks  by criminal groups is this:  Organized criminal groups have the structure, scale and funding to be able to mount stronger attacks and make better, faster use of any information they acquire. If a lone hacker acquires millions of credit card  numbers,  that  person  may  try  and  sell  the  information  on,  but the delay will already reduce the damage and the financial gain. Hacktivism:   There  is  a  fine  line  between  hacktivism  and  terrorism.  Both  have political goals. The two main differentiators for a hacktivist group are usually:    The  people  involved  believe  they  are  serving  a  greater good.  Save  the  planet,  remove  the  corrupt  officials  are examples.    The  individuals  involved  do  not  seek  to  raise  funds  from  their activities.    Hacktivist  groups  will  not  intentionally  engage  in  crimes  that will directly harm people or their personal finances.  Any  group  that  does  not  stay  within  these  boundaries  is  a  terrorist group. Hacktivists still engage in criminal behavior. Specifically, they still aim to  gain  unauthorized  access  or  cause  damage  to  other organization’s digital landscapes.  The nature of the work that your particular enterprise or organization does  usually  make  it  clear  if  you  are  likely  to  be  targeted  by hacktivist groups. Skilled Professional Hackers: These  are  the  assassins  for  hire  of  the  cyber  attack  world.  A distinction needs to be drawn between professional ethical hackers and professional criminal hackers.  Ethical  hackers  are  paid  by  the  customer  to  reveal  gaps  and weaknesses in their own defenses.  Unlike  ethical  hackers  who  use  their  skills  only  to  expose   but  not leverage   technical  gaps  in  cyber  defenses,  a  skilled  professional criminal  hacker  has  monetary  goals  without  ethical  standards.  A professional  criminal  hacker  will  seek  monetary  gain  through  their abilities without regard for the law.   Professional  hackers  are  extremely  up  to  date  with  the  latest technologies and exploits.  Just  like  any  cybersecurity  expert,  the  hacker  might  be  purely focused  on  technical  intrusions  or,  they  may  be  more  diversely skilled  and  able  to  use  social  engineering  and  other  attack techniques in combination with their technical ability.  Independent professional hackers with more diverse skills are more dangerous.  Independent  professional  hackers  engaged  by  organizations  that have  the  same  diverse  skills  within  their  structure  can  be  equally dangerous. Disaffected or Opportunist Insiders: People inside any organization, or inside any supplier with access to systems have permitted access that already takes them past many layers of defense.  In  any  enterprise  with  very  strong  cybersecurity  defenses,  the possibility  of  misuse  by  rogue,  criminal  or  otherwise  disaffected insiders  can  be  reduced  to  a  very  low  level.  If  privileged  access  is always monitored and supervised, it will usually take a collaboration effort to create substantial impact.  There is still an issue that somebody inside an organization can gain access  to  even  a  comparatively  small  amount  of  information, possibly just a single email and use it to create substantial damage.  As  covered  in  the  chapter  on  Human  Factors,  pre-employment screening  and  ongoing  monitoring  and  assessment  can  help  to detect potential candidates but are not foolproof methods.  A  disaffected  person  will  usually  be  motivated  by  the  amount  of damage  they  can  cause  to  the  person  or  enterprise  they  feel aggrieved by.   An opportunist insider is more likely to stumble into a situation where they believe they can make financial gain, potentially without being detected or losing their position.  As an example, a pharmaceutical company  not one I have worked for  had discovered a new drug formula that showed a lot of promise. When  they  came  to  try  to  patent  the  formula,  the  patent  office discovered  it  was  already  being  produced  and  sold  in  China.  After investigation, it emerged that a trusted employee in China had taken a  copy  of  the  formula  and  sold  it  for  just  a  few  thousand  dollars. Despite finding this out, the drug was nonetheless no longer able to be patented. The person went to prison for a very long time  I believe they  are  still  there,  regardless  of  when  you  read  this   but  the consequence for the company was a loss of potential revenue in the hundreds of millions of dollars range.  The  main  defense  against  this  type  of  attack  is  to  foster  a  strong, supportive  and  positive  security  culture  within  the  enterprise  and provide  employees  and  suppliers  with  examples  of  the consequences  of  the  behavior.  It  is  also  necessary  to  ensure  any information  is  only  accessible  or removable with appropriate safeguards.  incredibly  sensitive   that   is   trails,  access  permissions,  data   Audit  loss  prevention,  email screening tools, random physical searches, supervision, restrictions on the use of camera functions in the workplace are all examples of security controls that can be used to deter or prevent this behavior.  If you have an enterprise with a culture that makes employees and suppliers  feel  remote  and  unengaged,  you  are  likely  to  create disaffected insiders.  If  you  have  an  enterprise  that  does  not  closely  secure  sensitive information that can be subverted for financial gain, you are likely to suffer from breaches of cybersecurity by opportunist insiders.   A  major  issue  with  this  type  of  threat  is  that  the  person  does  not necessarily  need  to  have  any  cyber  attack  skills  at  all  to  be successful. Amateur Hackers and Journalists: A nation state that I will not name here, created a very sophisticated hacking tool. It cost them millions to develop and was very effective. They then made it freely available to download on the internet.  Why?  Easy,  they  could  defend  against  it,  it  allowed  them  to  upload  their own  malware  to  other  hackers  and  identify  who  they  are  and  it created  large  amounts  of  new  intelligence  through  the  activities  of the hackers who used the software.  It also means that even the most amateur hacker or journalist after a story can get hold of very sophisticated hacking tools.  A  danger  with  amateur  hackers  is  that  they  will  not  necessarily  be deterred by defenses that will put professionals off. If a professional finds a defense that is likely to catch them if they compromise it, they will probably leave it alone. Although the actions of an amateur are going to be relatively easy to trace, they may still create substantial damage in unexpected places.  Amateurs  are  more  likely  to  just  target  anything,  without  any understanding of the target value or consequences.  Journalists  may  be  more  targeted  because  their  motivation  is  to obtain information that is newsworthy. Anyone: There  are  many  organizations  who  study  cyber  attacks  and  their consequences.  The  two  biggest  changes  that  have  led  to  a substantial increase are:   1  To be successful at a cybersecurity attack used to require a  lot  of  expertise  and  specialist  tools  that  were  hard  to obtain. Now anyone can attempt an attack using software  packed with malware of its own  that can be downloaded over the internet.  2  The cost and potential value that can be extracted from a  successful cyber attack has increased exponentially.  Although most, high damage cybersecurity breaches are perpetrated by  skilled  or  organized  groups,  any  lone  individual  with  a  personal motive has a chance to try their hand at this criminal activity.  It is currently rare for private individuals to seek to steal information or penetrate the defenses of any company or household. However, the proliferation of free tools means that this form of attack is likely to increase,  especially  as  attacks  on  home  networks  are  currently extremely difficult to police and prosecute.  The threatscape for each enterprise is different. Depending on what your organization does or what you do, the groups and people that could  seek  to  take  advantage  of  your  digital  landscape  will  be different.  The number of attacks and level of automation is immense. Do not underestimate the extent of the cyber war that is taking place.  The speed that emerging technologies are being adopted and used means that our ability to use technology safely is always a few steps behind  the  latest  threats.  There  are  a  lot  of  groups  and  individuals out there who are ready to take advantage of those vulnerabilities.  The mantra for any effective cybersecurity is to ensure that there is always a defense in depth strategy actively operating to protect you. You  are  more  likely  to  survive  each  battle  if  there  are  multiple, effective layers of defense in place.   Part  of  any  cybersecurity  planning  should  always  include understanding  the  organizations  and  people  that  may  attack  your digital  landscape,  how  they  operate  and  how  to  ensure  adequate protection is in place. This is a usual step in the overall cybersecurity risk  assessment  that  any  Chief  Cybersecurity  Officer  will  regularly perform.   12.  Risk-Based Cybersecurity & Stacked  Risk  What  should  be  evident  from  all  of  the  case  studies  is  that  any organization  that  is  caught  out  by  substantial  breaches  in  their cybersecurity  did  not  have  a  clear  understanding  of  the  risks  they were  taking.  These  organizations  self-evidently  lacked  a  connected and informed view of their active risks.  Effective cybersecurity management relies on accurate capture and escalation of priority risks. If issues or problems are not consistently captured  at  an  individual  level  and  appropriately  escalated  when they  are  significant,  the  management  layer  will  be  operating  in  an uninformed  environment,  with  no  sense  of  the  true  gaps  and  their comparative priorities.  In this chapter we cover:    What is a cybersecurity risk?   How do you capture and manage individual risks?   How  do  you  deal  with  measuring,  monitoring,  managing  clusters of risks using:  ο Risk Registers ο Risk Assessments   How to apply risk-based cybersecurity management.  Managing risks individually, although important, will still create issues if the big picture view is not possible. When  organizations  suffer  from  major  financial  losses  through intrusions  and  data  losses,  it  is  always  the  case  that  a  chain  of separate and unresolved risks were in place. We will refer to this as stacked  risks  and  will  cover  this  topic  in  greater  detail  during  the Cyber Risk Register section of this chapter.   stacked risk –a chain of related problems that have the potential to  cause  greater  financial  impact  together  than  their  individual information may suggest.  Before  we  look  at  what  risk  is,  it  is  useful  to  consider  the  general problems and prejudices that people have in understanding any type of risk.  Consider the following items and what order of threat to life you think they  would  pose,  based  on  the  number  of  deaths  they  cause annually in North America:    Vending machines   Brown bear attacks.   Soft toys.   Being left handed.  Without  any  metrics  or  analysis,  we  can  easily  have  a  distorted impression of the reality. In fact, vending machines kill more people in the US each year  by falling on people when they rock them to recover loose items  than brown  bears.  Soft  toys  are  responsible  for  more  deaths  that  either brown bears or vending machines. Being left handed is thought to be the  biggest  killer,  through  accidents  caused  by  left-handed  people using equipment designed for right-handed people.   A  much  debated  study  in  1991  by  Halpern  and  Coren  showed  a significant  difference  in  life  expectancy  for  left-handed  people.  The study  was  later  dismissed  by  many  as  likely  to  contain  some statistical  anomalies.  However,  there  is  consensus  that  left-handed people  using  right-handed  equipment  does  cause  a  substantially greater number of accidents for them.     There were 11 deaths recorded in the US in 2012 due to soft toys, according to the US Consumer Product Safety      Commission. 2  or  3  people  die  in  the  US  each  year  due  to  vending machines.    An average of one person is killed in North America each  year due to brown bear attacks.    The  number  of  fatalities  due  to  being  left-handed  is  unrecorded.  How is this relevant to cybersecurity? We  have  the  same  issue  in  cybersecurity  that  without  an  accurate understanding  of  the  numbers  that  sit  behind  risks,  we  can  and  do make  mistakes  regarding  where  to  focus  our  security  efforts  and budget.  Without a full picture of the risks, as a cybersecurity manager, I might be  tempted  to  prioritize  spending  on  encrypting  data  because  it covers  a  lot  of  the  potential  attack  surface.  However,  if  I  had  full visibility  of  the  issues  and  comparative  countermeasure  costs  and benefits,  I  could  easily  discover  that  there  were  twenty  or  more, higher priority, higher impact and lower cost items to address first.  It is the largest, unresolved risks that create the most damage. You need to have a comprehensive and connected view of your overall risks  to  be  able  to  accurately  understand  where  the  cybersecurity priorities are.  When risks are presented in isolation, it is not possible to understand their comparative priority.  Before we get to the big, joined up view, we still need to understand the basics of capturing and managing individual risks. What is a Cybersecurity Risk? Anything  that  has  the  potential  to  cause  detrimental  impact  to  the electronic devices we use, or the information they store or transact,   can be considered a cybersecurity risk. Remember, that can include processes  and  other  non-technical  items  that  directly  affect  our security status.  For example, if there is a problem that Security awareness training is not being regularly provided, that can still be a risk to cybersecurity because  it  has  a  high  potential  to  lead  to  poor  usage  practices  by staff that will create increased, successful malware attacks.  Earlier  in  the  book,  we  have  looked  at  threats,  vulnerabilities  and other gaps. Each of these can also be considered, when they have  i   enough  probability  of  occurring  and   ii   potential  detrimental impact if they do, can also be considered sources of risk.  That is because the only 2 critical ingredients to a risk are:  1  Probability   also  referred  to  as  potential,  likelihood  or  chance  of the problem occurring.  2  Impact of a sufficient magnitude to be of material concern. There  are  a  number  of  ways  to  measure  probability.  The  most effective  method  is  to  ensure  all  expressions  of  likelihood  or  the chances  of  something  happening  are  translated  into  a  percentage value.  It  is  not  possible  or  essential  for  the  initial  probability percentage assigned to a risk to be exactly correct. That is because the percentage value assigned to each risk will be improved as the information about the risk grows. There  are  also  many  different  ways  to  measure  impact.  The  most effective way is to translate the cost of the potential disruption into a financial  amount  that  reflects  both   i   the  cost  to  fix  or  restore  the problem  after  it  has  occurred,  together  with   ii   the  cost  to  the organization that the problem can produce.  Remember,  the  cost  to  the  organization  due  to  disruption,  loss  of earnings or brand damage often contributes the highest value to the financial impact estimate.   In both cases, without a numeric value, it is not possible to evaluate the risk in any meaningful way. That is because the people recording and monitoring risk would otherwise have no ability to compare risks on a common scale. For  example,  if  I  have  a  risk   risk  A   that  can  create  one  million dollars  of  damage  and  another   risk B   that  can  create  ten  million dollars of damage, they may both be considered ‘very high’ impact, depending  on  the  size  and  budget  of  our  organization.  Only  by having  tangible  numbers  can  I  determine  that  one  of  those  risks  is ten  times  larger  than  the  other  and  therefore  more  likely  to  be  a higher priority to resolve.  Risk  often  uses  a  simple  mathematic  formula  to  help  identify priorities. Simply by multiplying the probability  %  of the risk by the potential  impact   $   I  can  arrive  at  an  adjusted  risk  figure  that  can help me to prioritize my risks.    Risk A has a 75% chance of occurring and a one million  dollar cost if it does. 0.75 x 1,000,000 = $0.75m  dollar cost if it does. 0.05 x 10,000,000 = $0.5m    Risk B  has  a  5%  chance  of  occurring  and  a  ten  million  Although risk B has a higher potential financial impact, by using the probability,  we  can  determine  that  the  higher  likelihood  of  risk  A occurring means we should seek to address risk A first. However,  there  is  also  a  third,  critical  parameter  to  consider, proximity. Proximity  is  a  measurement  of  time  to  help  assess  how  soon  we expect the risk to be active and problematic.   For  example,  we  might  be  launching  a  new  service  in  six  months time  that  is  associated  with  risk  A  but  risk  B  could  be  a  gap  or problem that is already active. In that situation, we may reasonably choose to tackle the immediate risk sooner than the risk that is not yet an active problem.  Capturing  basic  numerical  information  about  the  risk  is  a  key  step towards managing it.  The basic ingredients for something to be a risk are the presence of enough probability and impact to make the item significant enough to track. This is known as materiality. materiality  –to  have  a  level  of  significance  or  magnitude  to  be  of concern.  Generally,  the  larger  the  organization,  the  greater  the  financial impact  must  be  before  something  is  considered  to  have  enough materiality to be recorded and managed as a risk.  If  I  have  identified  an  individual,  critical  vulnerability  in  a  single application, it is only likely to be considered a risk if it could  on its’ own  create substantial impact to my organization. I will still need to ensure it is managed to closure through normal processes, but I will not need to ask for it to be tracked as a risk.  However,  I  may  also  determine  that  the  same  critical  vulnerability could be present in a large number of other applications and needs urgent  investigation.  In  that  case,  I  would  escalate  it  as  a  risk  if  I thought the collective impact was significant.  Each  organization  defines  their  materiality  threshold,  usually  as  a financial amount. If a gap or problem has the potential to cause the organization more than $x of financial risk  where x is the materiality threshold determined by the organization  it should be captured into the risk management process.   There  is  more  about  materiality  in  the  Risk  Register  section  of  this chapter. How Do You Capture and Manage Individual Risks? When a risk is reported, you need to then manage it effectively.  To manage individual risks effectively requires a consistent approach to  how  each  risk  is  captured  and  managed.  If  you  use  consistent processes,  you  create  risk  information  that  can  more  easily  be compared,  connected,  escalated   if  necessary   and  prioritized  later on.  There  are  several  risk  frameworks  available,  including  ISO  31000  the International Organization for Standardization approach to Risk Management ,  COSO   the Committee  of Sponsoring  Organizations of  the  Treadway  Commission   Enterprise  Risk  Management Framework and ISACA CRISC  Certification for Risks in Information Systems Control .  All  of  the  above  frameworks  are  valid  and  can  be  explored  further, depending  on  your  personal  or  organizational  preferences.  For  our purposes we will look at the core concepts that all risk frameworks share.  The 3 key ingredients are:    Ownership:  Ensure  that  each  active  risk  has  a  clearly     accountable owner. Lifecycle: Define and use a consistent risk lifecycle to let you know what state the risk is in.    Risk Information: Ensure that adequate information about  the risk is captured, including probability and impact.  Ownership: Each  individual  risk  must  have  a  clearly  assigned  owner  who the  risk.  Single  point accepts   the  accountability   to  manage    accountability is just as important here as it is throughout the security framework. Other people can and will help to manage and control a risk but there must be a specific person in control and accountable for managing the risk through to eventual closure.  Lifecycle:  individual   risks  have  a   All  lifecycle.  They  are  discovered, investigated,  analyzed,  treated  and  closed  as  necessary.  The simplest  risk  lifecycle  may  consider  a  risk  to  be  only  either  ‘open’  still a potential threat  or ‘closed  no longer a potential concern .  The more refined your risk lifecycle stages are, the easier it will be later on to differentiate new risks that are still being investigated from other risks that are further along the risk management process.  A good basic set of lifecycle stages would be:  Identified Investigating        Analyzing   Treating   Monitoring   Closed  These  do  not  need  to  be  followed  sequentially.  For  example,  there will  be  some  risks  that  are  reported   identified ,  investigated,  found not to be a risk and closed. Risk Information:  In addition to a brief description of the risk, it is important to capture other key information about it. As covered in the previous section, it is  essential  to  ensure  that  information  about  the  probability  and impact  is  captured.  It  does  not  matter  if  this  is  not  accurate  at  first because  the  information  about  the  risk  should  be  improved   or elaborated  during its lifecycle.   Risk  information  is  more  effective  when  it  is  captured  in  ways  that make the risk impact easier to analyze later on. For example rather than recording impact information only in free text, it is more useful when pick lists can be leveraged. For example, you might have the ability to select multiple values for what could be impacted:  Loss of critical service s  Loss of critical product s         Brand   organization image   Customer data   Company data   Employee data   Business processes   Financial processes   Internal applications   External applications   Regulatory or legal compliance    Intellectual Property  Other standard risk information can include proximity  how soon the risk may occur  and manageability  how capable the risk owner feels we are to be able to control the risk if we choose to . It is also usual to record who reported it and when  date and time .  Each  individual  risk  will  also   during  analysis   have  one  or  more methods  of  managing  identified.  These  are  known  as  risk countermeasures or risk treatment options. There are normally up to 5 primary ways to deal with  treat  a risk:    Prevention. This means you stop the risk cause, therefore preventing  the  risk  from  being  present.  For  example,  do not  adopt  a  particular  technical  component  that  causes the risk. This is sometimes considered a form of avoiding the risk.     Reduction. Do less of something to diminish the potential impact. For example, reduce the number of records that a system stores to diminish its potential loss exposure.    Acceptance.  Do  nothing,  if  you  think  that  the  potential probability  and  impact  is  low  enough  to  absorb  and pursuing other risk treatment methods is too expensive.    Contingency. Create a fall back plan to help decrease the impact from the risk if it does happen. For example, have an alternative system or process that can take over if the system at risk fails.    Transfer.  Make  the  risk  somebody  else’s  responsibility. For  example,  you  might  choose  to  insure  against  the potential loss.  There are many occasions when more than one risk treatment option will  be  selected.  For  example,  you  may  chose  to  do  less  of something  reduction  and insure  transfer  the residual risk. There  is  a  lot  of  flexibility  in  how  additional  information  about individual  risks  can  be  recorded.  To  make  the  risk  information usable,  the  critical  step  is  to  capture  the  key  information  described above in a consistent way and then share it into the appropriate list of risks, known as the risk register. The Cyber Risk Register:  format,   that  contains  entries   risk  register  –a  central  repository,  usually  in  a  consistent electronic  for  each  potential, significant  loss  or  damage  exposure.  Usually  there  is  a  minimum materiality  threshold,  for  example  a  minimum  potential  financial loss  value  that  must  be  met  or  exceeded  before  an  entry  in  the repository is required.   Although  a  risk  register  is  simply  a  list  of  risks,  if  it  has  key information about each risk captured using consistent formats, it can provide easy ways to identify:    Similar or identical risks that are being reported.   Risks that can combine together  stacked risks  to create more  overall  potential  problems  for  part  of  the  security landscape than the individual risks suggest.    The comparative risk priorities to address.  The important thing about a cyber risk register is that it captures any material  risks  that  have  the  potential  to  cause  significant  harm  or disruption  to  the  digital  landscape.  That  means  anything  that  can substantially impact the cybersecurity approach should be managed and monitored here. In large organizations, there is often a requirement to have different magnitudes of risks managed by different people. That is completely okay,  provided  that  there  is  a  process  to  escalate  risks  above  a certain,  defined  materiality  level  up  to  the  cybersecurity  managers attention.  In those circumstances, it is still better for everybody to use a single risk register and simply to restrict access or visibility of the register, based on each person’s privilege level. This will help to ensure that overall trends and patterns in risks can be more easily identified and escalated risks will already be in a standard format.  Another reason to use a single risk register is to help identify stacked risks.  together   Remember,  stacked  risks  occur  when  different  individual  risks  may combine  impact  part  of  our  organizations  digital landscape in an unexpected way. For example, there could be three separate  risks,  reported  by  three  different  parts  of  an  organization, all indicating they impact the same part of the attack surface or the  to    same  business  process,  application,  or  the  same  physical  location. The only way I can make the connection is if that information is in the same place and recorded to be able to report these patterns.  The more intelligence you have in the way you capture and manage your  risk  register,  the  more  informed  and  effective  you  will  be  at managing  the  cybersecurity  priorities  and  keeping  the  organization safer from attack, intrusion or other failures.  As  an  example,  an  advanced  cyber  risk  register  will  allow  risk owners  to  select  from  pick  lists  of  applications,  critical  business processes, assets, sites and other key parameters. That enables the risk register to show risk by these same variables.  A cyber risk register is a reactive, continuous operational mechanism to help understand the overall risk position at any point in time.  The  usefulness  of  the  register  depends  on  how  well  it  is  kept informed and how well engineered its risk information selections are.  A  major  benefit  is  that  because  the  materiality   impact  and probability   and  proximity  of  each  risk  has  been  put  in  place,  I  can now  make  informed  decisions  about  the  priorities  that  need  the greatest and fastest attention.  There are very comprehensive risk management software solutions out  there,  I  designed  one  of  them   AdaptiveGRC   and  they  do  not need to cost much to put in place, especially if they can be used out of the box and refined later on.  It  is  not  appropriate  or  reliable  to  depend  only  on  a  reactive  risk management  technique.  Now  we  should  also  look  at  what  a  risk assessment  is  and  how  it  can  be  used  to  more  proactively  identify gaps. Risk Assessments:   risk  assessment  –  a  systematic  process  for  the  proactive detection  of  potential  hazards  or  gaps  on  an  existing  or  planned activity, asset, service, application, system or product.  A  risk  register  is  a  good  way  to  reactively  detect  risks  once  a  risk management process is in place.  Risk  assessments  are  a  proactive  way  to  ensure  that  risks  are routinely analyzed and considered on any high value targets.  Risk assessments are designed to identify any major risks that could harm  a  particular  target  they  are  reviewing.  The  questions  and information  they  capture  will  depend  on  what  target  is  being assessed. For example, if I am performing a cyber risk assessment of an application, it is likely my questions will include understanding if the application is accessible from the internet, how many records it holds,  if  the  information  it  transacts  or  stores  contains  personal  or financial data, if it has the expected key security controls in place, if it has  suffered  problems  or  losses  in  the  past,  what  technologies  it uses and so on.  information  helps  me   This  the application is as a target, how much damage might be caused if it is compromised  and  whether  adequate  security  measures  have  been put in place.  to  understand  how  attractive   Although  risk  assessment  processes  vary  depending  on  what  their target is, their objective is always the same:    How valuable and sensitive is the target?   Have   the  right  risks  already  been  considered  and  addressed?    What are the gaps  if any  that still need to be addressed?   A risk assessment should always be performed before something is put  in  service  and  at  regular,  defined  intervals   for  example,  each time there is an update or each year, whatever happens first . For  cybersecurity,  we  are  always  particularly  interested  to  ensure risk assessments of target items critical to the digital landscape are performed. Specifically:    Technology services  internal or external    New hardware, especially network attached devices.   Software applications.   New data exchange connections  inbound or outbound .   Any data storage locations.   Network access points and other gateways.  The  results  from  risk  assessments  help  to  actively  understand  the collection of risks that apply to particular processes or components that affect the cybersecurity position of our organization. If any risk is identified during an assessment that crosses over our materiality threshold, we should also report that into the risk register.  To protect against groups of risks forming and causing breaches of our  defense  in  depth,  we  can  use  the  risk  register  to  reactively monitor  performance  and  risk  assessments  to  proactively  enforce checks for significant chains of risks in key targets. How to Apply Risk-Based Cybersecurity Management: It is unlikely that many organizations can afford to adequately secure everything. That means that it is important to efficiently focus efforts on securing the items that create the highest business revenues or if compromised,  would  create  to  business earnings.  the  greatest   impact   This is known as taking a risk-based approach because I am using the  potential  impact  and  value  of  each  item  being  compromised  to   help determine its priority.  risk-based –an approach that considers the financial impact of a failure and its probability to determine its’ comparative significance and priority for treatment.  With  limitations  on  budget  and  resources,  it  is  necessary  to  take  a step-by-step  approach  to   i   understand  what  the  real  business priorities are,  ii  optimize the environment to maximize the value and coverage  the  security  will  deliver  and   iii   deliver  the  appropriate security controls.  If I am trying to secure a new or previously unsecure environment, it is likely that instead of trying to secure everything in the first pass, I will use a faster, risk-based approach to:       Identify the highest value information targets first. Identify  the  digital  assets  that  information  needs  to  flow through and on to.    Verify  the  needs  and  business  case  for  how  and  where  the information is needed.    Consider   the   threats   to  my  organization  and   the  probabilities of them occurring.    Minimize the footprint of any sensitive data based on the  business case.    Then add the appropriate security controls.  If  there  is  a  strong  and  established  risk  register  and  set  of  risk assessment processes already in place, I can use those sources to help achieve these goals. Where risk capture and assessment processes are not yet mature, a new cybersecurity manager will usually start by running a high level risk assessment of the organization. A simple version of that process is covered in the next chapter.   13.  How Cyber Exposed Are You?  Having audited the ‘in depth’ security of many companies, the gaps most enterprises need to be most concerned about are the ones that somebody could literally drive a truck through.  There are some great frameworks out there that can provide logical, step  based  guidance  to  gradually  put  all  of  the  correct  controls  in place.  NIST,  COBIT,  COSO,  UK  Cyber  Essentials  and  others  all have  comparative  strengths  and  overlaps  in  their  approaches  to putting effective organization wide approaches in place.  Although these are all valid, there are some very fast and easy ways to  determine  what  the  current  status  of  any  organizations cybersecurity. Consider these questions and how you would answer them for your organization:     Is security training of employees and suppliers mandatory and  regular  and  does  it  include  information  about  how easy  the company?  inadvertently  bring  malware   into   to   is   it     Are  you  unable  to  access  organization  email  on  a personal device if it contains certain sensitive information or has been classified as ‘confidential’ or higher?    Do  you  need  to  use  more  than  2  or  3  usernames  and passwords to access the main business applications you use?    Can  you  plug  non-organization  devices  into  the  main  wireless  or  otherwise   without  seeking  network  permission?    Do  any  key  systems  or  application  fall  over   have  their  availability disrupted  during weekdays?     Do  employees  and  contractors   feel  positive  and supportive to their organization; is it generally considered a good place to work?    Has  the  organization  been  kept  safe  from  cybersecurity breaches or other losses of electronic data that attracted external attention in the past 12 months?  If you answered ‘no’ to two or more of the above questions, it is very likely  that  there  are  substantial  cybersecurity  gaps  present.  This  is not  an  exhaustive  test  but  it  does  represent  the  most  significant symptoms that demonstrate complacency in the controls that should be present to manage cybersecurity. This is not sufficient evidence by itself that can be presented to the executive of an organization as a business case for investment. We need to take a more structured approach to create an understanding of the key business objectives and revenue sources, together with at least a basic cybersecurity analysis of the primary technologies and technology related processes they depend on.  In  this  chapter  we  will  briefly  explore  how  to  identify  the  major symptoms  of  poor  cybersecurity  and  how  to  translate  them  into  a meaningful  business  case  that  helps  to  encourage  the  correct investment to address them.  This is only the very basic framework that can be used towards an organization level risk assessment. It should only be used as a start point.  I have applied these methods to many different companies and they always  work.  Often  I  had  ten  days  or  less  to  pull  this  information together. By taking a business focused, risk based approach to the major  items  in  an  organization  it  is  comparatively  easy  to  capture and present the current status.   The  first  and  most  important  item  to  understand  is  what  the organizations main business and revenue generating objectives are. This  can  be  achieved  by  understanding  what  primary  services  or products  the  enterprise  relies  on,  together  with  looking  at  the strategic intentions on how the organization plans to move forward.  Unless you capture this information, you will not be able to effectively communicate any gaps you do find back to the key decision makers. It is essential that any problems are presented in the context of their potential business impact. If they are presented purely as technical or procedural deficits, they will usually be ignored.  For  example,  if  I  state  that  we  really  need  to  invest  in  $X  for  a security  architect  to  help  harmonize  and  reduce  our  attack  surface size,  that  is  not  a  tangible,  investible  item  that  a  non-technical, executive decision maker can understand.  If,  however,  I  present  that  our  products  and  services  that  generate our income of are extremely likely to suffer from an intrusion or loss costing  at  least  $Y  unless  we  spend  $X  on  identifying  and implementing  a  less  vulnerable  and  more  effective  security architecture, then that is more likely to be considered. My case will be even stronger if I include the additional business revenue benefits that  may  be  achieved  by  having  better  security  architecture.  Better security architecture can deliver a more trusted and robust customer experience,  delivering  more  data  value  for  both  the  customer  and our  company.  Only  when  you  can  present  and  use  real  examples and numbers that have a business focus will investment be possible.  Once  you  understand  the  business  objectives  and  the  value  they create, you can start to take a top-down look at the priority items that will  identify  if  the  cybersecurity  defense  in  depth  in  place  is  fit  for purpose.  If there are vast numbers of products and services, aim to look at the top five or ten, or if they rely on common systems, look at them as   product or service groups.  If  there  are  large  numbers  of  sites   physical  locations   and  data centers, choose a small representative sample of the largest.  The  first  item  to  look  at  relates  to  cybersecurity  governance. Remember,  this  means  looking  for  the  presence  of  a  cybersecurity management and escalation path, together with reporting structures, primary policies and procedures that help to ensure cybersecurity is consistently considered and managed during operations.  I  am  not  going  to  list  all  of  the  executive,  policy  and  procedure requirements in this chapter, but as a starting point, you would look at governance items that include:                   Is  there  a  security  steering  committee?  Does  their  remit include cybersecurity? Is  there  a  regular,  cybersecurity  status  report?  Does  it cover  all  major  defense  in  depth  categories?  Is  it  made available to appropriate managers?    Are the cybersecurity responsibilities clearly defined? Are  there  an  enterprise   level  security  architecture  the primary disciplines within cybersecurity represented? Is there a cybersecurity policy? Is  document? Is  there  a  security  awareness  training  procedure  and program?  Does  it  include  warnings  about  practices  that can cause malware infection? Is there a risk management procedure  or system  that is maintained that allows risks relating to data or electronic devices to be easily identified?  there  risk  assessment  processes   for deploying  new  products,  services  and  technologies?  Do they  include  sufficient  consideration  of  cybersecurity factors?  in  place     Are      …  It  is  also  important  to  check  that  any  policy,  procedure  or  training documents  if present  have been updated regularly and are actively sent, read and followed by appropriate people. The  next  step  is  often  to  check  if  there  are  usable  and  accessible inventories of the key components of the attack surface. Specifically, you would be looking for items including:           Is there a single, central list of all primary applications that the  organization  uses?  Does  each  application  entry identify a business owner, number of users, the type s  of information it manages  financial, personal, credit card, ...  Is there a list of suppliers, both technology suppliers and other suppliers who may use technology on your behalf? Is  the organization  is  accountable  for?  Is  there  an  ability  to check the security status of these devices, for example to verify  that  the  devices  are  running  up  to  date  anti- malware protection.  the  digital  devices   inventory  of   there  an   ο Does  this  include  a  list  of  ‘approved’,  secure  device  types?    …  ο Is   the  security  configuration  of  approved  devices  documented and appropriate?    Are  all  locations  where  electronic  personal  data  that  the  organization is accountable for tracked and managed?  Keep in mind that having several systems in place to meet a single requirement  creates  gaps.  For  example,  if  there  are  four  systems that  track  the  application  inventory,  that  is  certain  to  be  both inefficient and ineffective because information about the applications will not be able to be queried in one place or captured in exactly the same way.   Once you have identified the primary governance and management mechanisms that are  or are not  in place, it is possible to look at the organization  risk  from  the  perspective  of  each  primary  product  or service.  Taking one primary product or service at a time, look at what they do  business  objective   what  electronic  data  they  use  and  just  like  a plumber  tracks  water,  look  at  all  of  the  electronic  locations  that  the information flows through or on to. This will provide an understanding of  the  potential  attack  surface  items  to  investigate  further  and  the people  including suppliers  who operate them and what procedures are  in  place  to  ensure  cybersecurity  is  consistently  considered  and applied.  Consider the type of data that the application uses. Does it contain any  information  that  must  be  subject  to  more  security  due  to  its sensitivity?  If  the  data  contains  personal,  financial  or  confidential information,  the  controls  would  reasonably  be  expected  to  be greater.  Only  by  understanding  the  type  of  data,  the  amount  of  data  and where  it  flows  to  can  you  hope  to  review  where  it  could  be compromised.  It is frequently the case that only a primary application is thought to be used and when an assessment is run, it can become clear that there  are  many  secondary  applications  where  the  data  flows  to  or through that can be targets.  At  each  location  that  is  identified,  consider  all  of  the  usual cybersecurity  checks  we  have  covered  in  this  book.  Does  it  have secure configuration, is it access controlled, is it monitored to ensure it  is  running  up  to  date  anti-malware,  is  the  information  correctly classified, is the device always promptly updated with patches from the manufacturer and so on.   Remember to also look at the procedural controls that govern these electronic  locations.  Are  the  staff  operating  them  required  to  take security awareness training regularly, are access privileges managed on  the  basis  of  providing  the  lowest  amount  of  permission  each person  requires  to  do  their  job,  are  administration  and  operational roles separated.  A good organization assessment of its overall cybersecurity status is like a good book, it has a beginning, middle and end.  In  the  beginning,  you  are  looking  to  establish  the  business  needs and focus, and then look to see if all the headline items  governance policies, procedures and systems  are in place.  In the middle, you look at a representative sample of key products to understand  what  applications,  people,  supplier  and  digital  devices they  rely  upon.  You  also  look  to  understand  if  the  correct,  major cybersecurity  controls  are  in  place  at  each  step  of  the  journey  the business data is taking.  As you identify any gaps, record these, together with the corrective action s  that will address the problem s .  At the end you will be able to pull together a report that summarizes the cybersecurity position that is  or is not  in place. Remember, it is also important to translate how the gaps can create potential impact to business revenues and operations.  When we started this chapter, we mentioned that when organizations suffer  major  breaches,  it  is  usual  that  they  have  substantial  gaps. Although this kind of review may  also  locate very small problems, keep  in  mind  that  executives  do  not  want  or  need  the  detail,  they need the headlines.  It is necessary that your assessment is presented to any executive as  a  summary  of  the  major  items,  together  with  their  potential business impact and the key corrective actions  and costs  that can   fix  them.  The  detail  should  only  be  available  for  those  who  are interested.  Often, risks and gaps are not addressed simply because they were only  presented  as  a  technical  or  procedural  gap.  Unless  the problems  are  presented  their  business  revenue implications, they are unlikely to be addressed.  terms  of   in   An  example  format  for  an  executive  report  could  include  headline status for:    Governance: ο Cybersecurity  executive  management  and  escalation  structures.  ο Cybersecurity reporting  including primary risks . ο Cybersecurity policies and procedures status. ο Cybersecurity staffing.   Operations: ο Primary business applications and data storage locations  are monitored and tracked.  ο Places   that  store  electronic   information  have  an  information classification process that is followed.  ο Digital  device  inventories  are  maintained  with  security  status.  followed. ο Security   ο Baseline  security  configurations  are  defined  and  Incident  and  Event  Management    SIEM   processes are in place and effective.  ο Attempts  at  network  intrusion  and  malware  infection rates  are  monitored  and  any  trends  or  peaks  trigger appropriate alerts.  ο Patch management is timely and effective. ο User  privileges  are  set  to  lowest  level  to  facilitate  work  requirements.   ο Advanced firewalls are in operation. ο Anti-malware is up to date and effective  identifying any  areas of deficiency   ο Technical  contingency  plans   business  continuity  and  disaster recovery  are in place for critical systems.  ο There  is  a  data  retention  and  archiving  policy  or procedure in place that is ensuring electronic information is not being retained without business justification.    Compliance: ο A  program  of  regular  risk  assessments  is  in  place  and  tracking all key parts of the attack surface.  ο Penetration testing is being performed on internet facing applications  before  they  go  into  use  and  before  any update is applied.  ο A  sufficient  program  of  audits  or  assessments  that includes  checks  against  cybersecurity  related  policies and procedures is effective and in place.  It  is  relatively  easy  to  use  these  items  to  check  if  any  organization has substantial and open risks that can allow unauthorized access. The harder component is to translate these gaps into their business and revenue consequences. Poor  cybersecurity  is  typically  symptomatic  that  the  executive management are unaware of the issues and of the extreme personal and professional damage they can cause.  The items above are not an exhaustive list, they are designed to help perform  a  fast  assessment  of  the  major  items  that  are  required  to help  manage  the  safety  and  security  of  the  electronic  data  and devices that any organization will rely upon to function.   14.  What to Do When Things Go Wrong. In this chapter, we cover:    The difference between Security Events and Incidents   Security Incident Management   When to Escalate  You might notice that the chapter heading is ‘when’ and not ‘if’ things go wrong. It is statistically implausible to think that any organization of any size will  never  have  any  form  of  intrusion,  malware  or  other  detrimental items in their family of digital devices that need to be fixed. Despite that,  some  organizations  choose  to  put  their  head  in  the  sand, believing that denial is a potential solution.  According  to  a  2014  survey  conducted  by  PWC  for  the  UK Department of Business and Innovation Services, only 73% of large organizations  acknowledged  that  they  suffered  from  a  virus  or malware  infection  in  the  past  year.  So  what  happened  in  the  other 27%?  Is  it  great  security  practices  or  poor  detection  rates? Statistically, it is likely to be poor detection rates.  When things go wrong, you need to have something in place called a Security  Incident  Management  process.  Even  if  you  are  the  only security person in your organization, you need to have a playbook of instructions to follow when things happen.  Having  a  very  solid  and  reliable  process  for  dealing  with  security incidents  is  vital  to  minimizing  their  cost,  impact  and  limiting  the amount of time that the disruption causes. So, what is the difference between a security event and a security incident?   security event –a term used to describe a minor disruption to the digital  landscape  that  is  thought  to  be  unintentional.  Examples include  a  single  failed  device  or  a  single  user  forgetting  their password. Unusual patterns of security events can be an indicator of a security incident. security  theft  and or unauthorized access that has direct or indirect impact to any part of  an  organizations  information,  systems,  devices,  services  or products.  intentional  damage,   incident  –   the   Monitoring  security  events  can  provide  useful  information  towards security  improvements.  Often  this  also  acts  as  a  key  part  of  the security incident detection process.  Detecting  and  reporting  incidents   violations  or  other  intentional intrusions  is a key step in the security incident lifecycle. Security Incident Management: Security  incidents  can  cost  a  lot  of  money,  cause  significant disruption to any organizations business and create brand damage. Early and effective incident management helps to reduce the impact severity  time and costs .  Effective security incident management requires that an appropriate process  and  team  of  incident  responders  with  the  necessary  skills can be activated when something happens.  It is an essential feature of cybersecurity that the process is defined and regularly tested.  Without  a  prepared  and  tested  security  incident  process,  the  cost and  impact  of  any  attack  or  other  compromise  will  be  substantially greater.   The security incident process consists of five key lifecycle stages  six if you include the need to establish the process . These stages are best summarized as:    Detection & reporting.   Verification.     Cleaning  mitigation and restoration .   Review  analysis of patterns and process deficiencies .  Isolation  also known as quarantining .  Detection and reporting: People  within  an  organization  need  to  know  how  to  report  any suspected  or  confirmed  incident  into  the  process.  This  should  be both  directly  and  also  through  escalations  from  any  patterns detected  by  the  security  event  processes  and  systems  that  are  in place.  Advanced  security  event  monitoring  can  often  include  abilities  to automatically report suspicions trends or patterns.  Until an incident is reported into and triggers the incident response process, the damage the violation is causing will continue.  Verification:  Once  a  potential  incident  is  reported  into  the  process,  a  security incident responder  a role described in an earlier chapter  will need to verify if the incident is real and to categorize it.  As also covered earlier in the book, well defined categories and pick lists  can  be  used  to  help  speed  up  the  incident  response  process. This means that we should not only categorize the incident, but also capture as much information as possible about the key parts of the organization   sites,  services  and  products   and  the  attack  surface  devices,  systems,  applications,  data,  network  segments   that  are involved.   The US Computer Emergency Response Team  US CERT  defines six categories for a security incident. These are:  1. Unauthorized Access. 2. Denial of Service. 3. Malicious Code  including Malware . 4. 5. Attempted Intrusion. 6.  Improper Usage.  Investigation.  Your specific process can decide its own categories. This is a great place  to  start  and  I  recommend  allowing  as  many  categories  that apply to be selectable. If an incident involves multiple categories, this will be important to capture and resolve.  The  sixth  category   investigation   is  primarily  a  placeholder  to indicate  that  the  causes  and  effects  of  the  incident  are  still  being researched.  The security incident responder is also likely to involve experts from relevant disciplines to help manage the incident. It is important that the availability and priority for releasing these resources to the team is already defined and agreed.  Isolation  Quarantine :  If  an  incident  is  confirmed,  to  minimize  the  impact,  the  affected components must be isolated so that the violation is stopped.  This  can  be  a  tricky  step  in  the  process.  Consideration  has  to  be made  to  balance  out  the  ongoing  needs  of  your  organization  to continue to function and provide services, against the potential cost and impact of the violation.  Like  a  surgeon,  the  more  precision  and  care  that  can  be  taken  to isolate  the  affected  components,  the  better  received  the  incident response will be. If you have unaffected redundant systems or great   network segmentation as part of your defense in depth strategy, you are  more  likely  to  be  able  to  address  the  problem  with  minimal disruption.  If  disruption  to  operations  is  unavoidable,  ensure  the  process  has defined  communication  and  notification  procedures  already prepared,  so  that  the  people  who  rely  on  the  affected  systems  or devices  can  be  notified  concisely,  including  information  on  the expected amount of time that their services will be restored.  Senior process owners should be notified or consulted first whenever this is possible. A failure to consult with affected managers can bring hard  consequences  to  the  security  response  team.  If  the  incident takes  place  outside  of  core  business  hours,  the  emergency disruption  and  notification  procedure  for  taking  out  services  should already be defined. Reference and access to business continuity and disaster recovery plans will usually be required.  Cleaning:  Once the cause and affected components have been identified, the incident response team will need to be able to rapidly call upon the right  services  and  expertise  to  clean  and  restore  the  affected components.  In  some  cases,  it  may  not  be  possible  to  immediately  clean  and restore the component exactly as it was. This makes it essential for the team to include or be able to urgently access expertise to identify temporary  workarounds  that  can  restore  alternative  solutions  until the  affected  component  can  itself  be  recovered.  Again,  appropriate access to business continuity and disaster recovery plans are likely to be critical during this stage.  A further key consideration during the cleaning stage is to ensure the preservation  of  any  evidence  that  may  be  required  in  the  future.  If you  want  to  trace,  prove  or  litigate  against  the  attacker  after  the   event,  it  may  be  necessary  to  involve  digital  forensics  skills  to capture all of the information on the compromised components.  Again the criteria for when to preserve evidence should be defined as part of the incident response process.  Review:  As  soon  as  the  immediate  incident  has  been  resolved,  it  is  always advisable to look further at what happened both at the incident and process level.  Is the incident likely to occur on other similar components? Is it part of  a  larger  pattern?  Are  there  any  additional  and  immediate  steps that need to be taken to protect the digital landscape?  How did the process work? Was it effective? Did anything take too long?  Are  there  any  lessons  learned  that  need  to  be  included  as improvements to the process?  In addition to the lifecycle of security incident, it is essential to ensure the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  people  involved  in  the  process  are clearly defined. This means not only the security incident responder but also any and all roles that are critical to the process. If someone is called on to the team, it will help significantly if their responsibilities are clear to them.  There are two further essential features to define in the process.  The first is to define priority categories, together with clear criteria for how  each  priority  selection  should  be  made.  Usually  the  financial impact and or the number of people and or customers impacted, how badly  affected  they  are  and  the  sensitivity  of  the  data  or  service involved will all be relevant to the priority selected.  If the security incident only affects ten people on a low value system, then  the  impact  will  be  far  lower  than  if  it  was  a  business  critical system impacting hundreds, thousands or even millions of people. A   low value, low user systems can potentially be allowed to stay offline for  a  short  time.  Conversely,  many  businesses  cannot  afford  for some  systems  to  have  any  downtime  at  all.  Think  about  airline  or hotel  reservation  systems,  auction  and  property  websites.  Even  a few seconds or minutes of interruption can result in huge costs.  There will usually be a range of four or five different priorities to help categorize and respond appropriately to any incident.  When  assigning  a  priority,  it  is  also  important  to  be  careful  to consider not only the immediate incident but the wider implications. For example, if I have a malware infection on a small system, I may still need to assign a priority category if during the verification stage it is  identified  that  the  problem  could  quickly  spread  to  much  higher value parts of the attack surface.  The  second  item  to  define  is  when  a  security  incident  needs  to  be escalated. When to Escalate: There will be some types of security incident that may need higher level management than others.  If your process has well defined priority criteria, it can be immediately clear when more senior involvement in the incident management is required.  There  are  also  occasions  when  escalation  can  be  required  during the  security  incident  process.  This  can  be  because  the  incident  is moved to higher priority during the event or because the incident is not able to be managed inside normal tolerances.  For  example,  for  each  priority  category,  there  must  also  be  time limits defined for each stage to be completed. If the time allowed for the stage is exceeded, or the security incident manager is expecting   the  time  to  be  exceeded,  this  must  trigger  the  incident  to  be escalated and flagged as being in an alert status.  alert status – an escalation flag that can be assigned to a security incident to indicate that it is unable to be managed inside allowable time limits or other acceptable tolerances that are defined.  Having  a  comprehensive,  well  designed  and  response is critical to successful cybersecurity.  tested   incident  Equally,  perhaps  more  important  is  detection  and  notification.  It  is important  to  ensure  that  people  are  aware  how  to  report  potential incidents to the right place to trigger the security incident process.  Remember, it was alleged that Target received an anti-malware alert before  any  customer  data  was  taken.  If  that  did  happen  and  if  the alert  had  triggered  an  appropriate  incident  response  process,  then potentially the data breach would have been prevented.   15.  A Glimpse toward the Future  In the first full chapter we talked about how our rate of change is not only the fastest ever but is also accelerating.  It can help our cybersecurity planning to understand how technology will  continue  to  advance.  As  our  use  of  technology  increases  and matures, having a wider appreciation of the changes to expect can greatly assist in setting personal and professional strategies.  We  will  look  at  trends  and  new  technologies  set  to  become  more prevalent over the next decade and beyond.  There  is  absolutely  no  certainty  regarding  how  correct  or  incorrect these  predictions  will  be.  Many  of  the  near  term  predictions  are, however, already emerging, or already based on patterns that have already continued for many decades.  The most amazing thing about technology is that we no longer need to consider if something is possible. Almost anything is now possible to create. Instead of feasibility, the only real question now is – ‘Will it make money?’  The lure of profits, earnings and power will continue to be the main driving force for the advancement of technology.  There are certain easy predictions that we can begin with:    The  amount  of  electronic  information  we  use  and  store    The  costs  for  storing  and  processing  electronic  data  will    The amount of processing power will continue to grow in  will also continue to grow.  continue to drop.  line with Moore’s Law.    Displays will get larger, more flexible and more immersive.     The number of devices we use that can connect to each  other will grow.    Power  sources   batteries  included   will  get  physically  smaller and faster to charge.  Moore’s  Law  –created  in  1965  by  Gordon  E.  Moore,  states  that over  the  history  of  computing,  the  processing  power  doubles approximately every two years.  There  is  also  a  very  important,  underlying  trend  to  consider.  The change in the way companies earn profit.  Instead of selling one-off products or services, everybody is looking at how to create invaluable streams of services that attract repeating and regular income. Items that were once one-off product purchases are increasingly becoming subscription services.  The  closer  any  organization  can  get  to  their  customers,  the  better they can learn and extend those service sales into new areas. This means 2 things:  1  Organizations want to increase the amount of information  they store and analyze about their customers.  2  There  is  an  incentive  to  turn  items  that  are  currently  physical products into subscription services.  For  example,  instead  of  paying  for  a  refrigerator  and  freezer, perhaps it will be offered free as long as you sign a subscription for your essential items  milk, butter, cheese, ham, orange juice, ...  to be automatically supplied and delivered by a particular supermarket whenever they are running low. The agreement for the refrigerator will probably allow it to track those items,  the  level  of  stock,  how  much  you  use,  when  it  expires  and almost certainly, any other items you choose to put in it. For added   revenue  opportunities  it  will  probably  also  include  a  display  to promote other items it can be reasonably sure you will be interested in.  It  is  also  likely  they  will  offer  you  a  lower  subscription  price  if  you agree that they can collect and sell information about you.  This  kind  of  progress  is  already  being  made.  There  are  home thermostats that can accept remote instructions to turn the heat up and  down  and  detect  if  you  are  home  or  not.  They  can  potentially communicate with other items to let them know if you are in or out, for  example  to  switch  your  lights  on  in  the  evening  as  a  deterrent against  burglary,  or  to  tell  the  dryer  to  use  an  economy  mode because there is nobody in to urgently need the clothes.  Putting electronics into anything that we possibly can is now referred to as the Internet of Things  IoT .  Internet of Things –  the  inclusion  of  electronics  and  software  in any  device  not  usually  considered  computerized  in  nature,  to enable it to achieve greater value and service by giving it the ability to network and communicate with other devices.  Put  simply,  the  internet  of  things  is  the  idea  that  there  is  probably some  value  in  anything  electronic  being  able  to  connect  to  each other and to the internet.  As  things  change,  there  will  be  early  adopters,  late  adopters  and frequent attempts at new technologies that are ridiculous and never succeed.  Every  year  at  the  Consumer  Electronics  Show   CES   in Las Vegas, there are literally tens of thousands of new gadgets on display. Only a small number become successful.  With the price of technology power continuing to fall, more and more devices will be connected to the internet. As we begin to carry, wear   and  house  more  connected  devices  we  can  expect  that  those devices  will  be  targeted  by  all  kinds  of  organizations  and  people good and bad.  Wearable technology is also set to progress. Why put a computer in a  jacket?  Well,  it  could  be  useful  if  you  can  scan  and  change  the fabric color whenever you want and use the sleeve as a display for any messages that your phone receives.  One  of  the  new  gadgets  just  being  launched  includes  a  3D  food printer  for  your  home.  Put  in  some  small  ingredients  cartridges, select your desert and the food printer will instantly make it for you. Simply print and serve. Having this device on the internet of things has  the  potential  to  allow  it  to  download  new  recipes  and  also  to monitor what you like most and suggest other things you might like.  We already have Smart televisions that are close to fully functioning computers in their own right, in fact in some ways more advanced. As  I  was  writing  the  first  edition  of  this  book,  one  manufacturer issued a warning that conversations in front of their smart televisions can  be  recorded,  automatically  changed  to  text  and  sent  to  the manufacturer  to  help  with  product  improvement  of  their  voice command services!  If  you  think  that  seeing  targeted  ads  on  your  computer  or  tablet  is disturbing,  wait  until  those  advertising  display  screens  start displaying  ads  specifically  for  you  as  you  walk  past  them.  Imagine moving up the escalator on the subway and the ads in front of you promoting that holiday you have been researching.  Self-driving cars are set to revolutionize how we use transport. Most of  us  are  not  using  our  cars  95%  of  the  time.  Why  have  your  own cars if you could order one immediately to your door? Get it to drop you off exactly where you want and no need to worry about parking, maintenance costs. You can also enjoy a drink if you choose. Rather than paying for an entire car, you will literally be able to use one by   the minute, hour and mile. Without the cost of a driver, this type of service, still reliant on technology, will probably be so cheap to use that it will soon cost little more than just the fuel you currently pay for.  However, that also means that whatever car service you subscribe to will know where you go, when, who you travel with, what you travel with and more. Almost certainly, it will aim to show you targeted ads, or  offer  you  sponsored  opportunities   stop  here  for  50%  off  your meal  during your journey.  Although these more extreme forms of subscription services will not appear overnight, there are others that are closer to hand.  Health  is  also  benefitting  from  technology  advances.  Many  of  us already  use  some  devices  to  monitor  our  health,  diagnose  medical problems  or  improve  our  fitness.  Although  artificially  printed  organ replacements  are  some  way  off   somewhere  around  2030  is  my current  guess ,  it  will  be  possible  to  get  advanced  medical consultations  and  diagnoses  that  used  to  take  weeks  or  months, from the comfort of your own home in a matter of minutes or less.  I  already  had  my  own  life  saved  by  a  robot   a  Da  Vinci  robot , operated  by  a  surgeon,  that  was  capable  of  access  and  minimally invasive  techniques  in  an  area  of  the  body  that  the  human  hand alone  was  not  capable  of.  It  was  already  proved  possible  for  the surgeon  to  be  on  a  different  continent  to  the  patient  they  operated on. And then there is nanotechnology.  nanotechnology  –  incredibly  small  products  and  devices manufactured through the manipulation of items as small as atoms and molecules.   From  delivering  non-invasive  surgery,  to  enhancing  battery performance  or  even  enhancing  human  strength  and  durability,  the ability  to  manufacture,  deliver  and  control  technology  at  such extremely  small  sizes  creates  even  more  possibilities.  Forget corrective eye surgery, in the not too distant future, you may be able to splash the right collection of nanotechnology on your eyes to get not only perfect vision, but the ability to zoom in on distant objects, record what you see or even overlay a computer display.  All of these advances also mean that far more electronic data about all of us will be created and accessible.  Over  the  past  40  years,  the  progress  in  reducing  cost  of  storing information electronically, the physical size of storage and increasing the  speed  of  access  have  been  unbelievable.  To  put  this  into perspective,  if  you  wanted  to  put  the  entire  works  of  Shakespeare  text only  on to an electronic storage device, the electronic storage required   about  4  megabytes   would  have  cost  around  $4,000  in 1978. Today, you could store that for less than 20 cents. In ten years time, the cost will probably be less than one cent.  The  entire  scanned  content  of  an  average  print  library  can  already be  stored  on  a  few  2  Terabyte  SD  cards,  no  larger  than  your thumbnail.  Nobody  ever  thought  that  we  would  find  a  use  for  all  that  data storage.  They  were  wrong.  As  our  ability  to  store  content  has become  easier,  the  depth  of  content  has  become  greater.  For example,  the  target  for  digital  photography  used  to  be  11  million pixels, as that was an equivalent to the same quality that traditional photographs  could  achieve.  Now  digital  cameras  can  exceed  that resolution by a significant multiple.  Our data storage demands are roughly doubling every 2 years. The speed that we can access the information is also following a similar curve.  If  you  think  you  have  a  lot  of  information  to  look  after  now,   expect  to  be  looking  after  at  least  ten  times  more  information  a decade from whenever you are reading this.  Organizations can achieve a lot of power if they collect and use large amounts of data. They can use it to better target customers, discover new revenue opportunities and identify areas for reduced costs.  More data means there will be an increase in the surface area that needs  to  be  protected  and  more  types  of  data  also  opens  up  new potential threats and exploits.  These  changes  mean  we  can  expect  attempts  at  data  theft  to become faster and more frequent. Attacks will no longer need to be over a period of hours or days to be significant.  If  you  think  back  to  the  introduction  and  the  humble  smart  phone application  that  you  thought  you  downloaded  for  free,  the  payment was  really  anywhere  from  displaying  paid  ads  at  you  to  pulling private  targeted marketing purposes.  information  back,  probably  also  primarily   for   That  same  pattern  will  become  increasingly  apparent  in  more  and more mainstream items relating to our highest spend items. Health, food,  transport,  security  and  entertainment.  You  can  expect  more and  more  technologies  emerge  that  are  designed  to  turn  products into attractive, revenue earning services that will  also  collect data.  In addition to expanding orders from customer groups, organizations also focus on reducing operating costs. Technology is also driven in this direction.  Voice recognition programs are becoming smarter and smarter. They are already starting to replace some voice call handling  call center  services. One advantage  other than cost  is that a computer voice system can deal in almost any language.   It is doubtful that many call centers will have real people answering the phones ten years from now and is also likely that you may not know for sure if you are dealing with a person or a program.  Have  you  have  ever  attended  an  international  phone  or  video conference  with  non-native  English  speakers,  worry  not.  Within  the next decade, it will be possible to hold a real-time conversation with someone  even  though  neither  of  you  speak  the  other  person’s language.  The speed that technology is evolving also has certain other affects on how quickly or slowly we choose to adopt it. Although televisions are evolving rapidly, few of us want to take on the cost of changing up to the latest features every 3 years. This is a similar situation with cars and even most other household fixtures.  The  technologies  we  adopt  most  quickly  tend  to  be  those  that  are consumable, cheap or offer substantial value beyond their cost.  If someone offered me a free smart refrigerator for a subscription, I might sign up, but if they want $500 for it, I will probably stick with what I have until it goes wrong.  That  means  that  we  can  expect  wearable,  consumable  items  to continue  to  evolve  rapidly  and  higher  value  items  to  evolve  at  a slower pace.  The phone I have in my pocket today will probably be embedded in my  watch  and  in  an  invisible  earpiece  within  a  short  time  but  I probably will not be using a driverless car service for all my transport needs for quite a few years yet.  All  these  changes  will  affect  the  available  jobs  also.  Even  quite highly  skilled  jobs,  such  as  general  doctors,  will  be  decreased  as technologies  become  increasingly  able  to  deliver  faster,  more effective and lower cost alternatives. It will not be the case that there are no doctors; it will just be that your medical condition will need to   have reached a certain point in the diagnosis and treatment before a person may need to be involved.  If  we  think  about  the  near  term  impact  that  changes  in  technology will create, there are going to be new and expanding challenges for cybersecurity. As a species, we evolve by trying out lots of options. Most fail, some succeed. The same is true with how we are moving forwards with technologies.  The  technologies  that  become  popular  and  have  sufficient  security and  protection  to  be  reliable  will  endure.  Those  that  under-identify their markets and their security requirements will fall by the wayside.  One thing that will change in the coming years is that organizational security  will  become  strengthened  through  this  attrition  process. Organizations that are repeatedly compromised will lose customers and organizations that don’t will gain them.  Gradually,  it  is  likely  that  cyber  attacks  will  move  more  toward targeting  homes  and  private  people   where  the  security  is  the weakest  and that will also create new cybersecurity markets.  To  summarize  the  next  decade,  expect  to  be  dealing  with  new technologies and devices all the time. Expect the amount of data and locations of the data to continue to increase.  Looking  further  into  the  future,  many  people  wonder  about  artificial intelligence and a point in time known as the singularity.  singularity   the   –  the  predicted  point  in  time  when  artificial intelligence exceeds human intelligence.  There  are  still  a  lot  of  unsolved  problems  that  need  to  be  solved before  artificial  intelligence  can  become  a  reality.  Before  that  time, what is likely to happen is a greater degree of convergence between people and technology.   People  can  already  be  given  smart,  artificial  limbs,  eyes  and  ears, often with electronics connecting to send or receive information from the human brain. This has been referred to as wet wiring.  wet  wiring  –  creating  connections  between  the  human  nervous system and digital devices.  It will be possible  further out  to enable electronic information to be accessible  to  the  human  brain.  If  you  are  heading  to  Italy  for  a holiday,  instead  of  talking  through  an  external  translation  device,  it might  be  great  to  be  able  to  understand  and  speak  Italian  by ‘loading’  the  language  into  something  that  your  brain  can  directly access.  Although these items are much further out, it is likely that people will experiment with converging technology with biology. After all, if you can   eventually   have  artificially  manufactured  organs,  there  are unlikely to be few limitations to where technology ends and biology begins.  If  the  failing  brain  cells  in  an  Alzheimer’s  patient  were replaced with synthetic nanotechnology, would that change who they were?  This is a philosophical point that I could not hope to approach in this book.  the  purposes  of  our  cybersecurity  objectives,   For  the  main consideration  is  that  the  rate  of  change  will  continue.  There  will  be more  data,  in  more  places  and  more  technology  to  consider  and protect.  As  Heraclitus,  the  Greek  philosopher  once  almost  said:  ‘The  only constant is change.’  When I can paint my walls with a nanotechnology that allows me to change their color whenever I want, I will also know that one day I   may get home to find my walls have been hacked and are displaying some really awful content.   16.  Bringing it all Together  Would you drive around in a car that had absolutely no brakes?  Yet frequently people and organizations start using technologies for critical  activities  without  adequately  evaluating  them  for  their  risks and putting the appropriate defensive controls in place.  There  are  many  people  that  believe  that  effective  cybersecurity  is nearly impossible to achieve. The  reality  is  that  it  is  very  possible  to  achieve  substantial protection. Day  after  day,  there  are  new  cyber  attacks  and  breaches  causing damage to organizations through:       intrusions or disruptions to technologies theft or manipulation of electronic information  data .  Some  of  these  are  hitting  the  headlines  and  sometimes  they  may even  affect  us  personally,  for  example,  if  it  is  our  own  credit  card information that is among the information that was stolen. Successful  attacks  usually  happen  because  the  people  and organizations using them had little idea of the risks they were taking with their technologies and electronic information.  The  purpose  of  cybersecurity  is  to  take  reasonable  means  to  keep important technologies and data secure. Achieving this goal requires a  structured  approach  that  uses  all  of  the  key  processes  that  have been  covered  in  this  book.  It  requires  that  key  technologies  and collections  of  data  are  identified,  have  their  risks  analyzed  and  are appropriately protected, based on their value.  If you ran a large chain of stores, you might not be able to prevent all thefts,  but  you  can  take  steps  to  ensure  that  thefts  are  minimized   and the amounts that can be stolen in a single incident are low. The same is true with cybersecurity.  You should expect  and plan  to encounter and manage successful intrusions.  However,  it  is  also  critical  to  ensure  that  your  layers  of defensive,  detective  and  corrective  measures  reduce  the  likelihood and impact of those events.  Remember  that  cyber  attacks  have  the  same  criminal  motives  that have existed throughout history. There are  in reality  no new crimes; there are only new ways to achieve them. Most  cyber  attacks  can  be  prevented  if  the  correct  proactive steps are taken. If we look back at the different case studies, there is a clear pattern that  whenever  an  organization  cannot  bring  together  a comprehensive,  connected  and  informed  view  of  their  security status, chains of individual risks form and create ideal conditions for a substantial cyber breach.  There  are  still  many  large  organizations  that  do  not  have  their security  under  control.  This  is  often  evidenced  in  public,  after  an event.  Security improvements that are driven by a security breach are not a desirable or safe state for any organization or their executives to be in. It is far better for the security framework to provide a proactive, connected  and  informed  picture  of  the  substantial  business  risks, together with effective, actionable solutions.  There is a correlation between organizations that take a relaxed view on security and those that suffer the biggest cybersecurity breaches. If  you  are  a  large  organization,  that  correlation  statistic  reaches 100%.   Substantial breaches in the security of technologies can result in  i  huge costs,  ii  the end of many people’s careers and  iii  often the loss of substantial amounts of information.  The  first  step  towards  achieving  appropriate  protection  is  for  an organization to have the motivation to improve security:    Have the motivation to protect the digital landscape.   Understand the gaps   Design the security     Repeat  Implement  The right security controls are available. The  biggest  threat  to  us  all  is  our  own  human  complacency.  Our natural preference is to look at individual components and resist the difficulties of pulling together a holistic, informed and connected view of our security position. However, it is only by pulling together the big picture that we can know what individual tasks, risks and action are most important.  Now we are at the end of the book, let’s look back at what we have learned and what an effective approach to cybersecurity requires.    The  most  critical  item  is  to  have  executive   board  level  support  for  the  correct  investment  into  security.  That requires  presenting  the  executive  with  a  clear understanding of the size and scale of the organizations risk exposure.  ο You  may  need  to  prepare  a  business  case,  using  an organizational  risk  assessment  to  create  an  executive view  of  how  the  vulnerabilities  translate  into  potential business impact. is  essential   fully understanding and aligned with the organizations priority  the  business  case   ο It   that   is    goals and objectives.  ο Security must be presented in the context of its financial relevance to business operations and business goals to achieve executive support.    Security  governance  structures  then  need  to  be  defined and  put  in  place.  That  includes  not  only  policies  and procedures  but  also  the  security  steering  committee  and the criteria for when processes including incident and risk management  will  escalate  up  to  the  executive  level  for attention.    Consider your threatscape  threat landscape  early. Who might  be  motivated  to  attack  your  organization?  Your security  posture  will  need  to  reflect  how  attractive  your digital  assets  are  and  how  motivated  different  hostile groups might be to target your enterprise. Inventory and classify your priority digital assets based on their  business  value.  For  example;  require  business owners to classify their repositories of information to know what sets of data require the greatest amount of security control.     ο To  create  the  foundations  for  effective  defense  requires identifying what the main repositories of business critical information  are  and  what  digital  devices  they  flow through.  them   to  classify   ο Each  group  of  important  information  must  have  an identified  business  owner  who  must  be  give  a  process that  allows  the  scale,  sensitivity, criticality and potential business impact their information has. This requires capturing consistent information about the  consent requirements,  number  of  users,  amount  of  data  and business financial, product and service dependency.  confidentiality,   availability,   integrity,       In consultation with the business, remove or destroy data that is agreed to have insignificant or low value. Most of the  embarrassing  data  revealed  during  any  breach  was often kept unintentionally and had a risk value higher than its benefit. Who needs to keep 10 years of emails? Ask a lawyer and they will advise there is generally more to lose through excessive email retention than there is to gain.    Perform appropriate and regular risk assessment on your  technology targets:  ο Applications. ο Hardware devices. ο Other data storage locations. ο Network security. ο Suppliers that provide services through their technology.   Reduce  the  attack  surface  to  the  minimum  appropriate size  to  meet  the  business  needs.  This  includes  defining the  security  architecture  for  any  sensitive  assets  and information.  ο Use  a  security  architect  to  help  simplify  your  range  of  cyber defense points.  ο Zone  your  attack  surface  into  discrete  segments  that reflect  the  value  and  sensitivity  of  the  information  they transact. Apply the greatest security to the highest value zones.    Use up to date anti-malware across all devices that carry,  store or transact your information.    Ensure  that  you  have  strong  user  access  controls  that work  on  the  basis  of  providing  people  with  the  lowest amount of privilege they require to perform their role.    Patch all devices and operating systems promptly with the  latest security updates from their manufacturers.    Deploy  other,  key,  technical  countermeasures  such  as advanced firewalls with strong policies to critical locations.     Make  sure  the  security  settings  on  all  applications, systems and physical devices are set to an appropriately high level and remove all default accounts.    But  most  importantly  –  remember  that  defense  in  depth requires  a  holistic  view  of  security.  Physical  security, procedural  controls  and  cultural  conditions  are  key contributors  the  most  significant  and  successful attacks.  to   Understand your Organization & Business Objectives. The  extreme  dependency  organizations  now  have  on  technology and  the  immediate  costs  for  any  significant  breach  are  factors  that are  pushing  cybersecurity  into  a  top  3  consideration  for  CEOs everywhere.  This  function effectively if their key operational systems, or the data they contain, are  compromised.  The  impact  is  not  only  the  immediate  business disruption but also the legal, brand and recovery costs.  is  because  organizations  cannot   To be effective at managing cybersecurity requires taking the time to understand  how  the  business  earns  its  income  and  how  this translates  into  the  products  and  services  it  delivers  to  customers. This  will  then  allow  the  value,  function  and  priority  of  the  different components to be considered.  Each organizations situation and outlook is different. The approach to security will depend on many factors, including:  i  The nature of the business. The  greater  the  sensitivity  of  the  products,  services  and information  an  organization  provides,  the  more  robust  the security will need to be. The higher the value of the electronic information or service, the more attractive it is to attack. ii  The size of the organization & its risk appetite. The larger an enterprise is, the more likely it is to understand the risks and benefits of having a strong security posture. This   issues  a   is because large organizations cannot survive for long without appropriate  security.  The  number  of  large organization has causes it to understand the need for strong security  or  if  it  does  not,  it  gets  taken  down  or  taken  over. Smaller organizations tend to have larger risk appetites. This is  because   i   their  value  and  size  has  made  them   in  the past   less  likely  to  be  targeted,   ii   they  have  less  to  lose  if they  fail  and   iii   more  to  gain  if  they  succeed  by  taking  the chances their larger competitors cannot. iii  The culture and history of an enterprise. Companies  who  foster  strong  loyalty  and  positive  feelings from their staff are less likely to suffer from insider threats. If an enterprise has no history of any significant impact from a cyber  attack,  this  can  lead  to  executive  complacency  and  a higher  likelihood  of  large  security  gaps  that  will  lead  to  a substantial future cyber breach.  Resilience to investment in security is always due to a failure for the true business impact to be made clear to the executive. Security has situational dependencies. That means that  i  the more attractive  your  technologies  are  to  intrusion  +   ii   the  greater  your scale +  iii  the larger your security gaps =  iv  the more likely your organization is to suffer cyber attacks.  Payment card systems, intellectual property and services you make available over the internet are all examples of high value targets for cyber  attacks.  The  more  of  these  you  have  and  the  more  records each system has, the greater the security posture needs to be.  Very large organizations that have substantial volumes of attractive information  still  get  frequent  attacks,  even  when  they  have  high security.  Organizations  that  do  not  hold  personal  credit  card information,  or  operate  internet  based  services,  or  hold  intellectual   property suffer fewer attacks but often run with woefully low levels of security.  it   is   is,   important   Whatever  your  organizations  situation  to understand it and to present the need for security investment based on the business requirements. Cybersecurity is a Discipline. There  are  still  many  organizations  that  believe  one  person  can manage cybersecurity on their own, without any additional support. That is not possible.  The  subject  areas  are  too  diverse  and  moving  too  quickly  to  be managed and resourced by a single person.  Remember also, the Edward Snowden affect. If one person has too much  trusted  access  or  control  on  their  own,  the  organization  is  at risk.  Cybersecurity  Management,  Cybersecurity  Architects,  Network Security  Analysts,  Penetration  Testers,  Security  Incident Responders,  Firewall  and  Intrusion  Detection  Configuration personnel  are  all  examples  of  some  of  the  more  than  30  skill  sets required. If you are part of a very small organization, unable to justify or afford to fully employ all the cybersecurity skills you require, it is possible to buy in specialist services only when they are needed. In the same way you may not have a dedicated electrician or plumber on site, you can engage services, for example, penetration testing or security audits from external suppliers for specific pieces of work.  Effective  cybersecurity  requires  a  team  approach.  It  also  requires more knowledge than any single person can acquire and maintain. Defense in Depth: Most  texts  on  cybersecurity  focus  exclusively  on  the  technical  and immediate procedural controls:     User access controls   Anti-malware   Secure configuration   Firewall, intrusion detection & prevention management, ...   Encryption   Patch management   Technical security architecture   Active security monitoring alerts for patterns of port scans    Penetration  testing  of  all  internet  facing  applications  and other threats,  before use or upgrade,    …  It  is  important  to  understand  that  although  all  of  these  are  very important, other traditional security layers are also needed:    Effective risk capture and management processes   Security incident and event management   Business continuity and disaster recovery readiness   Physical security   Security awareness training   …  You should consider all opportunity layers that can help to safeguard information. Creating  a  Holistic,  Cybersecurity: The  key  to  cybersecurity  success  is  creating  a  comprehensive, connected and risk informed approach that is aligned to the business strategy and objectives set by the executive.  Informed  and  Connected  View  of  It  is  not  as  difficult  as  it  seems  to  create  a  comprehensive  and connected view of security risks. There are plenty of frameworks and   platforms available. Consider further review of ISACA COBIT and or COSO frameworks for guidance.  Similarly, platforms including AdaptiveGRC  the one I designed  can offer  an  easy  way  to  start  with  an  off  the  shelf  set  of  synchronized processes  for  further  refinement.  They  allow  you  to  pull  all  of  your process, risk and remediation information into one synchronized data source for easier management and prioritization.  Consider  that  when  insurers  were  looking  at  pricing  for  cyber insurance, they would consider four primary indicators:    How many vulnerabilities does the organization have?   How robust are its defenses?   How  attractive  and  potentially  profitable  are  its  digital    How  motivated  are   the  attackers   to   target   the  assets?  organization?  If your organization has an informed and accurate understanding of these items you are far less likely to be caught out. As  this  book  was  being  sent  for  formatting,  most  insurers  were choosing to no longer offer coverage for cyber risks. In Conclusion: It  should  be  evident  that  we  are  all  increasingly  reliant  on technologies. They are now the foundation to almost every product and service we use, even those we trust our safety and lives to.  This trend is continuing at a rapid pace.  Significantly, everyday items are being increasingly connected to the internet. Already, over half of all data usage is through or on mobile devices. With the internet of things becoming more pervasive, more and  more  of  the  technologies  we  rely  upon  will  use  an  even  more diverse set of device and communication types.   This will make effective security even more important.  Most  current  cyber  attacks  are  currently  focused  on  compromising organizations.  As  organizations  get  better  at  protecting  their  digital  assets,  we should  expect  the  endpoint  technologies  used  by  individuals  to  be targeted.  Most  private  people  have  atrociously  inadequate  security on  their  private  devices.  In  terms  of  the  future,  we  should  expect home cybersecurity to become more evolved as attackers work out ways  to  gain  power  and  money  from  intruding  people’s  home systems.  Right now, most organizations have inadequate security that can be compromised far too easily. That makes improving the protection of the  digital  assets  and  electronic  data  that  are  accountable  to organizations a priority.  From  the  case  studies,  it  should  be  evident  that  organizations  that get  compromised  are  consistently  missing  a  comprehensive, connected and informed view of the risks they are taking.  Keeping  on  top  of  trends  in  attack  patterns  and  changes  in technology usage are also important.    Mobile  technology  represents  more  than  half  of  all  data  usage and is increasing.    Expect new forms of malware to be able to bypass many defense  layers,  increasing  the  reliance  on  having  an effective defense in depth approach.    Actively monitor changes to external threats and improve  defenses accordingly.  Cybersecurity is about protecting organizations and ultimately people by  preventing  damage  or  harm  from  their  electronic  devices  being compromised.   Too much security can result in making your electronic environment unappealing or difficult for your customers, suppliers and staff to use. Too  little  and  you  can  lose  the  confidence  of  your  customers  and cease to exist.  Technology is now the backbone of any enterprise. In the same way we  take  logical  steps  for  our  own  personal  protection,  we  have  to take  logical  steps  to  protect  the  electronic  data  and  digital  devices that are critical to the operation and survival of our organizations.  Without  an  ability  to  trust  and  rely  on  our  key  technologies,  our organizations  are  unable  to  continue  to  operate,  deliver  services, retain  customers  and  deliver   for  non-profit organizations  justify their value and existence.  revenues  or   No  cybersecurity  can  ever  be  100%  foolproof.   There  is  always  an idiot  out  there  who  is  smarter  than  you  are!   However,  using  a defense  in  depth  strategy  that  includes  technical,  procedural  and physical  controls,  together  with  creating  a  connected  view  of  the information assets, security controls, risks and gaps can ensure that any problem can be minimized, isolated and managed.   Cybersecurity to English Dictionary  A fuller version of this section is available as a separate publication. Cybersecurity terms used in the book and others that may be of use are included.  access controls –the ability to manage and restrict entry or exit to a physical, virtual or digital area through the use of permissions issued at  a  personal,  electronic  or  physical  level.  The  permissions  can  be issued as physical tokens  something you have , secret information  something  you  know   or  biometric  information  –  using  part  of  the human  body  such  as  a  fingerprint  or  eye  scan  to  gain  access  something you are . See also multi-factor authentication. advanced persistent threats  APTs  – a term used to describe the continuous stream of attempts by hackers to infiltrate digital devices and  then  leave  malicious  software  in  place  for  as  long  as  possible with the purpose of stealing, corruption  breaking , extortion and or disruption. adware  –any  computer  program   software   designed  to  render adverts to an end user. This type of software can be considered a form of malware if the advertising was not consented to by the user, is  made  difficult  to  uninstall  or  remove,  or  provides  other  covert malware functions. alert status – an escalation flag that can be assigned to a security incident to indicate that it is unable to be managed inside allowable time limits or other acceptable tolerances that are defined. anti-malware – is a computer program designed to look for specific files  and  behaviors   signatures   that  indicate  the  presence  or  the attempted installation of malicious software. If or when detected, the program  seeks  to  isolate  the  attack   quarantine  the  malware ,   remove it if it can and also alert appropriate people to the attempt or to their presence. applications – any program  software  that resides on any device. Usually a program exists to create, modify, process, store, inspect or transmit  specific  types  of  data.  For  subversive  applications,  see malware. attack – the occurrence of an unauthorized intrusion. attack and penetration test – see penetration testing. attack mechanism – a term to describe the method used to achieve an unauthorized intrusion. attack  vector  –  a  path  or  means  that  could  be  used  by  an unauthorized  party  to  gain  access  to  a  digital  device,  network  or system. attacker  –  an  umbrella  term  to  cover  all  types  of  people  and organizations  that  may  attempt  to  gain  unauthorized  access  to  a digital  device,  application,  system  or  network.  See  also  black hat, hacker, hacktivist, cyber warrior, script kiddies,… availability  –  the  assignment  of  a  value  to  a  set  of  information  to indicate its sensitivity to disruption or outage. Often this is expressed or  translated  into  a  scale  of  time.  Data  with  the  highest  possible availability rating would be required to be ready at all times, often through the use of a fully redundant failsafe. assessments –  the  evaluation  of  a  target  to  achieve  one  or  more measurement  goals  through  the  collection  of  information  about  it. Usually,  this  is  achieved  through  an  established  and  repeatable process involving discussion or responding to questions. attack  surface  –  the  sum  of  the  different  points  where  an unauthorized user  the “attacker”  can try to enter data to or extract data from an environment.   audits –the use of one or more independent examiners  auditors  to check  if  a  target  product,  service  and or  location  is  meeting  the specific control standards required. This form of inspection requires that  individual  controls  are  tested  to  confirm  their  suitability  and consistent  usage.  The  outcomes  from  this  type  of  event,  including any  gaps  discovered  and  corrective  actions  required  are  always provided in a final report. backdoor –an unofficial method to access software or a device that bypasses the normal authentication requirements. biometrics – the use of physical qualities and attributes as a form of identity  authentication.  Fingerprint  scans,  retina  scans  and  facial recognition are all examples of biometric. As fast as new biometric options are created, the means to defeat them often follow. For this reason,  biometrics  is  usually  used  only  as  a  part  of  a  multi-factor authentication. black-box  penetration  testing  –  is  the  term  used  to  describe  a situation where no advance information about the technical details of a  computer  program  have  been  made  available  to  those  who  are checking it for vulnerabilities. They are operating without any inside knowledge, so the term is used to indicate a lack of visibility inside the ‘box’  program  they checking. black hat – a person who engages in attempts to gain unauthorized access  to  one  or  more  digital  devices  with  nefarious   criminal  or unethical  objectives. A hacker with unethical goals. black-listing –  in the context of cybersecurity  adding a specific file type, URL or data packet to a security defense program to prevent it from  being  directly  accessed  or  used.  For  example,  a  website domain  can  be  blocked  using  firewall  rules  to  ensure  that  no  user can visit that website through usual means.   bleeding edge - Using inventions so new, they have the likelihood to cause  damage  to  their  population  before  they  become  stable  and safe. border gateway protocol  BGP  - is a standard format that different systems on a network can use to share and make decisions on the path  routing  for information. bot-  is  a  computer  program  designed  to  perform  tasks.  They  are usually simple, small and designed to perform fast, repetitive tasks. Where the purpose of the program is in conflict with the organization, they can be considered to be a form of malware. See also botnet. bot herder – is a hacker who uses automated techniques to seek vulnerable networks and systems. Their initial goal is to install or find bot  programs  they  can  use.  Once  they  have  one  or  more  bots  in place,  they  can  control  these  to  perform  a  larger  objective  of stealing,  corrupting  and or  disrupting  information,  assets  and services. See also botnet. botnet – shortened version of robotic network. A connected set of programs designed to operate together over a network  including the internet  to achieve specific purposes. The purpose can be good or bad. Some programs of this type are used to help support internet connections, malicious uses include taking over control of some or all  of  a  computers  functions  to  support  large  scale  service  attacks  see  denial  of  service .  Botnets  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  a zombie army. breach  notification  procedure  –some  types  of  information,  when suspected or known to be lost or stolen, are required to be reported to  one  or  more  authorities  within  a  defined  time  period.  The  time period varies by regulator but is often within 24 hours. In addition to reporting  the  known  or  suspected  loss,  the  lead  organization responsible for the information  referred to as the data owner  is also required to swiftly notify those affected and later to submit a full root   cause analysis and information about how they have responded and fixed the issues. To meet these legal obligations, larger companies usually  have  a  pre-defined  breach  notification  procedure  to  ensure that  the  timelines  are  met.  The  fines  for  data  breaches  are  usually increased or decreased based on the adequacy of the organizations breach and incident response management. Business  Continuity  Plan  –   abbreviation  BCP   an  operational document  that  describes  how  an  organization  can  restore  their critical products or services to their customers should a substantial event that causes disruption to normal operations occur. brute  force   attack   –  the  use  of  a  systematic  approach  to  try  to gain unauthorized access. For example, if there is a single password that  is  only  8  characters  long,  there  are  only  a  finite  number  of possibilities that can be attempted through an automated attempt of all  possible  combinations.  Computing  speeds  make  brute  force attempts to try millions of possibilities easy if other defenses are not present. CAPA – acronym meaning corrective action preventive action.  See corrective and preventive action system. clear  box  penetration  testing  –  see  white  box  penetration testing. closed system – a collection of applications, systems and devices that  only  have  the  ability  to  communicate  with  each  other.  No connection to any component outside the known and trusted group is permitted. cloud   the   –  An  umbrella  term  used  to  market  any  technology service that uses software and equipment not physically managed or developed  by  your  organization.  A  ‘cloud’  service  can  involve  any technology  service;  location  and management of the equipment. Usually a ‘cloud’ service is indicated  the  difference   is  only   the    by an ‘aaS’ suffix. For example – SaaS  Software as a Service , IaaS  Infrastructure as a Service  compliance–  is  the  process  used  to  verify  that  governance  items are being followed and to identify any gaps. This can include audits, assessments, continuous monitoring and other formally reported deficiencies  tracked  through  corrective  and  preventive  action systems. computer virus –see virus confidentiality – the assignment of a value to a set of information to indicate  the  level  of  secrecy  required  and  used  to  set  access restrictions.  A  typical  example  scale  for  confidentiality  is:   i   Public Use  ii  Internal Use  iii  Confidential  iv  Strictly Confidential and  v  Restricted consent  –  where  personal  information  is  involved,  there  are  often legal constraints that govern how the data can be used and where the  information  can  be  viewed,  stored,  transmitted  or  otherwise processed. These constraints can be represented by a series of tags but are much harder and more sophisticated to represent. Required attributes  can  include  but  are  not  limited  to,  country  of  origin, permission  for  export,  limitations  of  use,  retention  and  notification requirements. continuous  monitoring  –  using  technology  to  actively  monitor ongoing security and other process control status to provided faster alerts  when  any  substantial  infringements  that  create  risks  are detected.  For  example,  continuous  automated  monitoring  for  port scanning  can  detect  patterns  that  can  indicate  an  imminent  attack and alert the appropriate personnel. control  –   in  the  context  of  security  and  compliance   a  method  of regulating  something,  often  a  process,  technology  or  behavior,  to achieve  a  desired  outcome.  Depending  on  how  it  is  designed  and   used, any single control may be referred to as preventive, detective or corrective. control  modes  –  an  umbrella  term  for  preventive,  detective  and corrective methods of defense. Each one represents a different time posture, preventive controls are designed to stop an attack before it is successful, detective controls are designed to monitor and alert during  a  potential  compromise  and  corrective  controls  are  the rectification of an issue after an event. corrective control –  see also control  a method of defense that is introduced  as  the  reactive  result  of  an  observed  deficiency  in security. For example, the addition of greater network segmentation after an attack can be considered a corrective control. corrective  action  –A  specific  activity   triggered  by  an  event   that when complete will result in the mitigation or resolution of a problem. The  fact  the  activity  is  triggered  by  an  event  makes  the  activity reactive and therefore corrective. corrective and preventive action system  CAPA  – An automated tracking process to ensure that key activities  actions  to resolve or mitigate  gaps  in  security  or  compliance  are  consistently  tracked through to completion. cross-site scripting  also known as XSS  –  a  security  exploit  that takes advantage of security design flaws in web generated pages. If the  dynamic  pages  from  a  legitimate  site  do  not  have  very  robust rules, users machines can be exploited by a 3rd party to present false links  or  dialog  boxes  that  appear  to  be  from  the  legitimate  site  but are not. A specific instance of an XSS vulnerability is known as an XSS hole. cyber –for anything using this as a prefix, see digital devices cyber attack – to take aggressive or hostile action using or targeting digital devices. Although targeting the use of digital devices or their   information as a weapon, the intended damage is not limited to the digital  electronic  environment. cyber  defense  points  -  the  digital  locations  where  we  could  add include  data, cybersecurity  controls.  Example  defense  points  applications, systems, devices and networks cyber insecurity Suffering from a concern that weaknesses in your cybersecurity are going to cause you personal or professional harm. cybersecurity  –  The  protection  of  digital  devices  and  their communication channels from danger or threat. Usually the required protection level must be sufficient to prevent unauthorized access or intervention  that  can  lead  to  personal,  professional,  organizational, financial and or political harm. cybersecurity control types –categories used to help organize the defenses  against  cyber  attack.  Usually  these  categories  are   i  technical  ii  procedural  iii  physical and  iv  compliance  or legal   contractual . Each of the cyber defense points  should  have  all  of the cyber control types considered and in place as appropriate to the risks. cyber warrior – a person that engages in attempts at unauthorized access  or  disruption  of  digital  devices,  systems  or  networks  for personal, political or religious reasons. dark  internet  –publicly  accessible  electronic  data  content  that  is only unreadable due to its format or indexing. For example, a store of  raw  scientific  information  may  be  internet  accessible  but  without indexing  or  context  it  is  considered  part  of  the  dark  internet.  This term has a very different meaning than dark web. dark  web  –websites  that  hide  their  server  locations.  Although publicly  accessible,  they  are  not  registered  on  standard  search engines and the hidden server values make it extremely difficult to locate what organizations and people are behind the site.   data – information stored in an electronic or digital format data  breach  notification  procedure  –see  breach  notification procedure. DDoS    See Distributed Denial of Service decapitation –  in the context of malware  to remove the ability for malware to send or receive instructions and other information from the  controlling  attacker.  This  can  effectively  render  many  forms  of malware ineffective. This is a method of takedown. deep web –internet content that cannot be seen by search engines. This  includes  not  only  dark  web  content  but  also  harmless  and general  content  that  is  not  indexed  or  generally  reachable,  for example - personal databases and paid content. default accounts –  generic  user  and  password  permissions,  often with  administrative  access  that  is  provided  as  standard  for  some applications and hardware for use during initial set-up. defense in depth – the use of multiple layers of security techniques to help reduce the chance of a successful attack. The idea is that if one  security  technique  fails  or  is  bypassed,  there  are  others  that should  address  the  attack.  The  latest   and  correct   thinking  on defense  in  depth  is  that  security  techniques  must  also  consider people and operations  for example processes  factors and not just technology. Denial  of  service   DoS   –  an  attack  designed  to  stop  or  disrupt people  from  using  your  systems.  Usually  a  particular  section  of  an enterprise  is  targeted,  for  example,  a  specific  network,  system, digital  device  type  or  function.  Usually  these  attacks  originate  from and  are  targeted  at  devices  accessible  through  the  internet.  If  the attack  is  from  multiple  source  locations,  it  is  referred  to  as  a distributed denial of service or DDoS.   to  defeat   the  means   detective control –  see also control  a method of defense used to help  identify  items  or  issues  that  may  occur  but  are  not  being defeated  or  prevented  by  other  means.  For  example,  an intrusion detection system  may  identify  and  alert  a  new  issue  but  may  not have  the  problem  without  additional intervention. devices  –  any  hardware  used  to  create,  modify,  process,  store  or transmit  data.  Computers,  smart  phones  and  USB  drives  are  all examples of devices. digital  device  –  any  electronic  appliance  that  can  create,  modify, archive, retrieve or transmit information in an electronic format. digital  forensics  -  a  specialist  field  to  help  preserve,  rebuild  and recover  electronic  information  and  help  investigate  and  uncover residual evidence after an attack.

Thought to be based on an abbreviation of the word ‘documenting’. drive-by download – the unintended receiving of malicious software on  to  a  device  through  an  internet  page,  electronic  service  or  link. The  victim  is  usually  unaware  that  their  action  permitted  new malicious software to be pulled into their digital device or network. dynamic  host  configuration  protocol   DHCP   –  the  standard method  used  on  networks  and  the  internet  to  assign  an  address  internet  protocol  or  its communications  to  operate.  This  address  is  assigned  by  server  host  each time an authorized digital device connects to it.  to  any  digital  device   to  allow   IP     encryption – the act of encoding messages so that if intercepted by an  unauthorized  party,  they  cannot  be  read  unless  the  encoding mechanism can be deciphered. ethical hacker – an alternative name for a penetration tester. event – see security event. exfiltrate –to move something with a degree of secrecy sufficient not to be noticed. Used to describe moving stolen data through detection systems. exploit  –  to  make  use  of  a  security  vulnerability.  Well  known exploits are often given names. Falling victim to a known exploit with a name is generally considered to be a sign of low security. file  transfer  protocol   FTP   –  the  standard  method  used  to  send and  receive  packages  of  information   files .  SFTP  or  secure  file transfer protocol is the secure variation of this, used to send and receive data through an encrypted connection. Even if data is sent through  an  encrypted  connection,  it  will  not  itself  be  automatically encrypted. firewall  –  is  a  hardware   physical  device   or  software   computer program   used  to  monitor  and  protect  inbound  and  outbound  data  electronic  information .  It  achieves  this  by  applying  a  set  of  rules. These physical devices or computer programs are usually deployed, at  a  minimum,  at  the  perimeter  of  each  network  access  point. Software  firewalls  can  also  be  deployed  on  devices  to  add  further security. The rules applied within a firewall are known as the firewall policy. forensics – see digital forensics. governance  –  the  methods  used  by  any  executive  to  keep  their organization  on  the  management  goals  and  within acceptable  performance  standards.  This  is  usually  achieved  by  track   to    establishing  policies,  procedures  and  controls  that  match  the enterprises vision, strategy and risk appetite. governance,  risk  and  compliance  –  a  term  to  describe  the interaction and interdependence between the activities that  i  control any organization  governance   ii  verify and enforce those controls  compliance  and  iii  manage any substantial exposures to financial impact that emerge, often due to gaps in  i  or  ii . hacker  –  a  person  who  engages  in  attempts  to  gain  unauthorized access to one or more digital devices.

See also hacktivist. hacktivist  –  an  amalgamation  of  the  words  hacker  and  activist. Describes  any  individual  who  operates  either  independently  or  as part  of  a  group  to  use  subversive  techniques  through  digital  or electronic  means  to  serve  a  political  or  social  cause  that  they  may see as serving a broader interest. honey  network  –  the  collective  name  for  a  cluster  of  honeypots that  operate  together  to  help  form  part  of  a  network  intrusion detection strategy. honeypot  –  an  electronic  device  or  collection  of  data  that  is designed  to  trap  would  be  attackers  by  detecting,  deflecting  or otherwise counteracting their efforts. Designed to look like a real part of an enterprises attack surface, the honeypot will contain nothing of real value to the attacker but will contain tools to identify, isolate and trace any intrusion. Host-based  Intrusion  Prevention  Systems   HIPS  –  a  version  of an  intrusion  prevention  system  installed  directly  on  the  digital   device  it  is  protecting  against  exploitation.  See  also  intrusion prevention system for a description of its purpose. hyper text transfer protocol  HTTP  – is the standard method used to  send  information   files,  pictures  and  other  data   over  the  world wide web. HTTPS or SHTTP  is  the  secure  version  of  this  protocol that can be used when the information requires a secure connection. It is rumored that the security for https   shttp is already or may soon be able to be broken by some organizations. internet  protocol  –  is  the  set  of  rules  used  to  send  or  receive information  from  or  to  location  on  a  network,  including  information about  the  source,  destination  and  route.  Each  electronic  location  host   has  a  unique  address   the  IP  address   used  to  define  the source and the destination. incident – see security incident. incident  response  –a  prepared  set  of  processes  that  should  be triggered when any known or suspected event takes place that could cause material damage to an organization. The typical stages are  i  verify the event is real and identify the affected areas.  ii  contain the problem  usually by isolating, disabling or disconnecting the affected pieces .   iii   Understand  and  eradicate  the  root  cause.   iv   Restore the  affected  components  in  their  fixed  state.   v   Review  how  the process  went  to  identify  improvements  to  the  process.  An  incident response may also be required to trigger other response procedures, such as a breach notification procedure, if there is any information has  been  lost  that  is  subject  to  a  notification  requirement.  For example – the loss of any personal information beyond what might be  found  in  a  phone  book  entry  is  usually  considered  a  notifiable event. infection –  in the context of cybersecurity  unwanted invasion by an outside agent that has intent to create damage or disruption.   information systems – see systems. inherent  risk  –  the  level  of  exposure  to  loss  or  impact  something has before any mitigating controls are taken into consideration. For example, holding credit card data in a system brings an inherent risk to the system. See also residual risk. integrity –the assignment of a value to set of information to indicate its  sensitivity  to  unauthorized  modification  or  loss.  Loss  in  this context is about an inability to recover the information. Often this is expressed  or  translated  into  a  scale  of  time.  Data  with  the  highest possible integrity rating would not be allowed to lose information or have any unauthorized modification take place. Internet  of  Things   IoT   –  the  incorporation  of  electronics  into everyday items that allows them to be connected to each other. Intrusion  Detection  Systems   IDS   –  a  computer  program  that monitors and inspects electronic communications that pass through it,  with  the  purpose  to  detect,  log   record   and  raise  alerts  on  any suspected malicious or otherwise unwanted streams of information. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems  IDPS  – a computer program that monitors and inspects electronic communications that pass  through  it,  with  the  purpose  to  block  and  log  any  known malicious or otherwise unwanted streams of information and to log and  raise  alerts  about  any  other  traffic  that  is  suspected   but  not confirmed  to be of a similar nature. Intrusion  Prevention  Systems   IPS   –a  computer  program  that monitors and inspects electronic communications that pass through it,  with  the  purpose  to  block  and  log   record   any  malicious  or otherwise  unwanted  streams  of  information.  These  are  usually placed in the communication path to allow the prevention  dropping or  blocking  of  packets   to  occur.  They  can  also  clean  some   electronic  data  to  remove  any  unwanted  or  undesirable  packet components. keylogger – a form of malicious software that is used to record and disclose  entries  on  a  digital  device.  This  type  of  malware  is  often used to collect credit card details, user identities and passwords. logic bomb –a type of malicious software  malware  that only starts to  operate  when  specific  conditions  are  met.  For  example,  if  a particular date is reached or if a companion piece of malware is no longer detectable. malware – shortened version of malicious software. A term used to describe  the  insertion  of  disruptive,  subversive  or  hostile  programs onto a digital device. These types of programs can be intentional or unintentional.  Intentional  versions  are  usually  disguised  or embedded  in  a  file  that  looks  harmless.  There  are  many  types  of malware;  adware,  botnets,  computer  viruses,  ransomware, scareware,  spyware,  trojans  and  worms,  are  all  examples  of intentional  malware.  Hackers  often  use  malware  to  mount cybersecurity attacks. master boot record –the  first  sector  on  any  electronic  device  that defines what operating system should be loaded when it is initialized or re-started. Moore’s Law –created in 1965 by Gordon E. Moore, states that over the  history  of  computing,  the  processing  power  doubles approximately every two years. multi-factor authentication – using more than one form of proof to confirm  the  identity  of  a  person  or  device  attempting  to  request access. There are usually three different categories of authentication types,  i  something you know [often a password]  ii  something you have  [perhaps  a  security  token  or  access  card]  and   iii   something   you  are  [use  of  biometrics,  for  example  fingerprint  or  facial recognition]. nanotechnology  –  incredibly  small  products  and  devices manufactured through the manipulation of items as small as atoms and molecules. NAS – Network attached storage. A digital repository attached to a network where information can be stored. networks – the group name for a collection of devices, wiring and applications used to connect, carry, broadcast, monitor or safeguard data. Networks can be physical  use material assets such as wiring  or  virtual   use  applications  to  create  associations  and  connections between devices or applications.  Network-based  Intrusion  Prevention  Systems   NIPS   –  see Intrusion Prevention Systems. network  segmentation  –  splitting  a  single  collection  of  devices, wiring  and  applications  that  connect,  carry  broadcast,  monitor  or safeguard  data  into  smaller  sections.  This  allows  for  more  discrete management of each section, allowing greater security to be applied in sections of the highest value and also allowing smaller sections to be impacted in the event of a malware infection or other disruptive event. OWASP – the Open Web Application Security Project. This is a not- for-profit organization that helps improve the security of software. packet –  in the context of electronic communication  is a bundle of electronic information grouped together for transmission. The bundle usually  includes  control  information  to  indicate  the  destination, source and type of payload, and the payload  user information  itself. packet-filtering  –passing  or  blocking  bundles  of  electronic information based on rules. See also packet.   patch  management  –a  controlled  process  used  to  deploy  critical, interim  updates  to  software  on  digital  devices.  The  release  of  a software ‘patch’ is usually in response to a critical flaw or gap that has been identified. payload – the part of the data in a transmission that is the usable content  rather  than  the  packaging.  In  the  context  of  cybersecurity, this  term  is  often  used  to  refer  to  the  harmful  data   malware  for example  that is attempted to be pushed into a target digital device, network  or  system.  For  example,  an  attacker  exploits  a vulnerability to deliver their payload of malware. penetration test  also known as an attack and penetration test or pen. test  – checks and scans on any application, system or website to identify any potential security gaps  vulnerabilities  that could be exploited.  Usually  these  checks  emulate  the  same  techniques  that could be used by an attacker and are performed in a test area. This is to prevent any inadvertent operational disruption. The checks are typically  conducted  before  any  application  or  site  is  first  used  and also  on  a  periodic   repeating   basis,  for  example,  each  time  the program is updated or every 6 months. Any significant gaps must be addressed  fixed  in a timeframe appropriate to the scale of the risk. See also pivoting. penetration tester – a person that performs simulated attempts at attack on a target system or application on behalf of the organization that owns or controls it. See also penetration test and pivoting. periscope up When people hold a smart device up at head height or higher to capture an event on the device camera. persistence –to seek continued existence despite opposition. phantom vibration - You thought you felt your smart device vibrate but find out that it did not, or realize that there is no smart device in that area of your body right now.   phishing – using an electronic communication  for example email or instant messaging  that pretends to come from a legitimate source, in an attempt to get sensitive information  for example a password or credit card number  from the recipient. physical security –measures designed to deter, prevent, detect or alert unauthorized real world access to a site or material item. pivoting – a method used by penetration testers and attackers to leverage  a  point  of  infiltration  as  a  jumping  off  point  into  other systems and networks. policy  –  a  high  level  statement  of  intent,  often  a  short  document, providing  guidance  on  the  principles  an  organization  follows.  For example,  a  basic  security  policy  document  could  describe  the intention  for  an  enterprise  to  ensure  all  locations   physical  and electronic  where information they are accountable for must remains secure  from  any  unauthorized  access.  A  policy  does  not  usually describe the explicit mechanisms that would be used to achieve or enforce the intentions it expresses. polymorphic  malware  –malicious  software  that  can  change  its attributes  to  help  avoid  detection  by  anti-malware.  This  mutation process  can  be  automated  so  that  the  function  of  the  software continues but the method of operation, location and other attributes may change. port number – used as part of electronic communication to denote the method of communication being used. This allows the packet to be directed to a program that will know what to do with it. preventive  control  –   see  also  control   a  method  of  security defense  used  to  stop  issues  before  they  can  become  problematic. For  example,  multi-factor  authentication  assists  in  stopping unauthorized access from ever occurring and is therefore considered a preventive control.   file    HTTP ,   transfer  protocol   procedure  –  provides  guidance  or  specific  instruction  on  the process   method   that  should  be  used  to  achieve  an  objective. Traditionally  provided  as  a  document  available  to  appropriate personnel but increasingly replaced by enforcing steps in computer systems. protocol –   in  the  context  of  electronic  communication   is  a  set  of established  rules  used  to  send  information  between  different electronic  locations.  They  provide  a  standard  that  can  be  used  to send  or  receive  information  in  an  expected  and  understandable format, including information about the source, destination and route. Examples  of  protocols  include,  internet  protocol   IP ,  hyper  text transfer  protocol   FTP , transmission  control  protocol   TCP ,  border  gateway  protocol  BGP  and dynamic host configuration protocol  DHCP . ransomware – a form of malicious software  malware  that prevents or restricts usage of one or more digital devices or applications until a sum of money is paid. red team –when testing for potential exploits on any very critical or sensitive  system,  infrastructure  or  website,  a  team  of  penetration testers  is  usually  used.  This  term  is  used  to  describe  the  group  of penetration testers working together on this type of objective. residual risk – refers to the remaining possibility of loss and impact after  security  controls   the  risk  response   for  an  item  have  been applied. risk – a situation involving exposure to significant impact or loss. In formal  frameworks,  risk  can  be  quantified  using  probability   often expressed  as  a  percentage   and  impact   often  expressed  as  a financial  amount .  Other  parameters  for  risk  can  include  proximity  how  soon  a  potential  risk  may  be  encountered  and  information about  what  assets,  services,  products  and  processes  could  be affected .   risk assessment – a systematic process for the proactive detection of potential hazards or gaps on an existing or planned activity, asset, service, application, system or product. risk-based  –an  approach  that  considers  the  financial  impact  of  a failure,  its  probability  and  proximity  to  determine  its’  comparative significance and priority for treatment. risk register –a central repository, usually in a consistent electronic format,  that  contains  entries  for  each  potential,  significant  loss  or damage exposure. Usually there is a minimum materiality threshold, for  example  a  minimum  potential  financial  loss  value  that  must  be met or exceeded before an entry in the repository is required. rogueware – see scareware. rootkit –  a  set  of  software  tools  that  can  be  used  by  attackers to gain  privileged  access  and  control  to  the  core   root   of  the  target device. scareware – malicious software that is designed to persuade people into  buying  an  antidote,  usually  masquerading  as  a  commercial malware removal tool or anti-virus package but in reality provided by the attacker. script bunny – see script kiddies. script kiddies – an attacker with little to no coding  programming  or technical  skills  that  makes  use  of  available  scripts,  codes  and to  digital  devices, packages  applications,  systems  and or  networks.  Also  known  as  script bunnies and skiddies. secure configuration – ensuring that when settings are applied to any item  device or software , appropriate steps are always taken to ensure   i   default  accounts  are  removed  or  disabled,   ii   shared  to  gain  unauthorized  access    incident  –   accounts are not used and  iii  all protective and defensive control in the item use the strongest appropriate setting s. secure  file  transfer  protocol   also  known  as  SFTP   –  see  file transfer protocol  FTP . secure  hyper  text  transfer  protocol   SHTTP   –  see  hyper  text transfer protocol. security event –a  term  used  to  describe  a  minor  disruption  to  the digital  landscape  that  is  thought  to  be  unintentional.  Examples include  a  single  failed  device  or  a  single  user  forgetting  their password. Unusual patterns of security events can be an indicator of a security incident.

SIEM  –  abbreviation  for  security  incident  and  event  management. This is a name given to the process and team that will manage any form  of  minor  or  major  interruption  to  an  enterprises  digital landscape. signatures  –   in  the  context  of  cybersecurity   are  the  unique attributes, for example, file size, file extension, data usage patterns and method of operation, that identify a specific computer program. Anti-malware  and  other  security  software  makes  use  of  this information to identify and manage rogue software.  the    single  point   of   accountability  –   abbreviation  SPA  or  SPOA   is the  requirement  to  have  an  individual  owner  identified  for  the protection  of  each  process  or  asset  where  a  failure  can  create substantial  impact.  The  rationale  is  that  the  absence  of  a  defined, single  owner  is  a  frequent  cause  of  process  or  asset  protection failure. singularity   the   –  the  predicted  point  in  time  when  artificial intelligence exceeds human intelligence. skiddie – abbreviated form of script kiddie. social engineering – The act of creating relationships or friendships in  order  to  intentionally  acquire  intelligence  about  the  security, location or vulnerability of assets. spear  phishing  –  a  more  targeted  from  of  phishing.  This  term describes the use of an electronic communication  for example email or  instant  messaging   that  targets  a  particular  person  or  group  of people  for example employees at a location  and pretends to come from a legitimate source. In this case, the source may also pretend to be someone known and trusted to the recipient, in an attempt to get  sensitive  information   for  example  a  password  or  credit  card number . spoofing – concealing the true source or electronic information by impersonation  or  other  means.  Often  used  to  bypass  internet security filters by pretending the source is from a trusted location. spyware  –a  form  of  malware  that  covertly  gathers  and  transmits information from the device it is installed on. SSL  –  is  an  acronym  for  Secure  Sockets  Layer.  This  is  a  method  protocol   for  providing  encrypted  communication  between  a  web server  the computer hosting a web service or web site  and a web browser  the program that the recipient uses to view the web page-   for  example,  Internet  Explorer .  In  the  URL   the  internet  address visible to the user , the use of SSL is denoted by an ‘https:’ prefix. stateful  protocol  analysis  detection  –  is  a  method  used  by intrusion  detection  systems  to  identify  malicious  or  unwanted communications. This method analyses packets to determine if the source,  destination,  size  and  routing   protocol   is  significantly different from its usual format. statistical anomaly based detection – is a method used by some intrusion  detection  systems  to  identify  malicious  or  unwanted communications.  The  program  reviews  the  metrics  it  collects  to identify any groups of communication behaviors that are unusual or anomalous. Structured query language injection  SQM injection  – a form of security exploit that takes advantage of security design flaws in web forms. When a a web form does not sufficiently validate  check  the content of information returned to it from a web form, an attacker can use  this  flaw  to  insert  malicious  values  into  the  database.  The consequences  can  be  the  database  and transactions. systems –  groups  of  applications  that  operate  together  to  serve  a more complex purpose. takedown  –  the  process  of  rendering  malware  ineffective  by removing  its  ability  to  perform  its  functions.

You may be a business person keen to understand this important subject area or an information security specialist looking to update your knowledge. 'The world has changed more in the past 10 years than in any 10 year period in human history. . . Technology is no longer a peripheral servant, it shapes our daily lives. Companies that can use technology wisely and well are booming, companies that make bad or no technology choices collapse and disappear. The cloud, smart devices and the ability to connect almost any object to the internet are an essential landscape to use but are also fraught with new risks and dangers of a magnitude never seen before.' Also featuring an alphabetical section at the back of the book to help you translate many of the main cybersecurity technical terms into plain, nontechnical English.
