Cybercrime and Digital Forensics  This book offers a comprehensive and integrative introduction to cybercrime. It provides an authoritative synthesis of the disparate literature on the various types of cybercrime, the global investigation and detection of cybercrime and the role of digital information, and the wider role of technology as a facilitator for social relationships between deviants and criminals. It includes coverage of:    key theoretical and methodological perspectives;   computer hacking and malicious software;   digital piracy and intellectual theft;   economic crime and online fraud;   pornography and online sex crime;   cyber-bullying and cyber-stalking;   cyber-terrorism and extremism;   digital forensic investigation and its legal context around the world;   the law enforcement response to cybercrime transnationally;   cybercrime policy and legislation across the globe.  The  new  edition  features  two  new  chapters,  the  first  looking  at  the  law  enforcement response to cybercrime and the second offering an extended discussion of online child pornography and sexual exploitation.  This book includes lively and engaging features, such as discussion questions, boxed examples  of  unique  events  and  key  figures  in  offending,  quotes  from  interviews  with active  offenders,  and  a  full  glossary  of  terms.  This  new  edition  includes  QR  codes throughout  to  connect  directly  with  relevant  websites.  It  is  supplemented  by  a companion website that includes further exercises for students and instructor resources. This text is essential reading for courses on cybercrime, cyber-deviancy, digital forensics, cybercrime investigation, and the sociology of technology.  Thomas  J.  Holt  is  a  Professor  in  the  School  of  Criminal  Justice  at  Michigan  State University, USA.  Adam  M.  Bossler  is  a  Professor  of  Criminal  Justice  and  Criminology  at  Georgia Southern University, USA.  Kathryn C. Seigfried-Spellar is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Technology at Purdue University, USA.  “The  second  and  expanded  edition  of  Cybercrime  and  Digital  Forensics  is  a  most  welcome  update  on  this popular  introductory  text  that  covers  the  field,  from  the  origins  of  computer  hacking  to  the  seizure  and preservation of digital data. Each chapter begins with a useful general overview of the relevant literature on the  2   topic or issue covered, whether economic cybercrimes or online stalking, and then provides coverage of laws, cases,  and  problems  not  just  in  the  US  but  pertinent  to  other  jurisdictions.  Additional  chapters  on  child exploitation  materials,  the  role  of  transnational  police  and  private  investigation  of  cybercrime,  and  expanded treatment  of  cyber-terrorism,  allow  for  more  in  depth  treatment  of  these  topics  and,  importantly,  options  for streaming or modifying the content of taught courses on cybercrime and digital investigations. The authors have again provided numerous online sources in the text and cases for students to explore, and a supporting website that should help to keep readers and instructors in touch with this rapidly changing field.”  — Roderic Broadhurst, Professor of Criminology, RegNet, Australian National University  “It is unusual to find a book in this field that does not simply focus on the technical aspects of the subject area. This book brings together a wide range of literature, sources, and real case-studies to provide an in-depth look at this ever-changing subject area. The book is rich in material and is a good read for those just starting to look at cyber-security, all the way through to those living and breathing it.”  — Emlyn Butterfield, Course Director, School of Computing, Creative Technologies and Engineering, Leeds Beckett University  “The  style  and  organization  of  the  book  are  ideal,  not  only  for  the  introductory  student,  but  also  for  the  lay reader.  What’s  more,  the  timeliness  and  detail  of  the  issues  discussed  make  it  a  useful  resource  for  more advanced researchers. In this book, the authors have delivered something for everyone.”  — Peter Grabosky, Professor Emeritus, RegNet, Australian National University  “Cybercrime and Digital Forensics provides an excellent introduction to the theory and practice of cybercrime. This  second  edition  introduces  new  chapters  on  law  enforcement  responses  to  cybercrime  and  an  extended section on online child pornography and sexual exploitation. The authors have introduced new and recent case material  making  the  subject  relevant  and  accessible  to  academics  and  students  interested  in  this  new  and exciting field of study. I used the first edition of this book extensively in teaching an undergraduate course on cybercrime. This new edition updates and expands on the topic. Both students and teachers will be attracted to the clarity of presentation and extensive use of cases to focus discussion on challenging issues.”  — Dr Lennon Chang, Lecturer in Criminology, School of Social Sciences, Monash University  3   Cybercrime and Digital Forensics  An Introduction  Second Edition  Thomas J.

Although  it  is  difficult  to  comprehend,  less  than  two  decades  ago  most individuals  did  not  own  a  cell  phone  and  personal  computers  were  still  somewhat expensive  pieces  of  equipment.  Individuals  could  not  text  and  email  was  uncommon. Internet  connectivity  was  possible  through  dial-up  modems  or  Ethernet  cabling  and people paid by the hour for access to the Web. Video game systems used 16-bit graphics and  did  not  connect  to  other  devices.  Global  Positioning  Systems   GPS   were  largely used in military applications only.  Today,  most  of  the  world  now  depends  on  computers,  the  Internet,  and  cellular technology. Individuals now own laptops that are connected via Wi-Fi, cell phones that may  also  connect  to  the  Internet,  and  one  or  more  video  game  systems  that  may  be networked. In addition, people have multiple email accounts for personal and business use, as well as social networking profiles in multiple platforms. Cell phones have become a preferred method of communication for most people, especially text messages. In fact, individuals under the age of 20 regularly send more texts than any other age group, and prefer  to  send  texts  rather  than  make  phone  calls   Zickuhr,  2011 .  Individuals  also frequently  purchase  goods  online  and  are  increasingly  using  e-readers  for  books  and newspapers rather than traditional print media.  It is amazing to consider that the world and human behavior have changed so quickly through  the  use  of  technology.  In  fact,  there  are  now  3.4  billion  Internet  users worldwide, comprising 46.1 percent of the world’s population  Internet Live Stats, 2016 . China  and  India  have  the  largest  population  of  Internet  users,  though  only  55  percent and 34 percent of their total populations have access  Internet Live Stats, 2016 . The USA, Brazil, and Japan have the next largest populations, though a much greater proportion of their populations have access  88.5%, 66.4%, and 91.1% respectively: Internet Live Stats, 2016 .  The proliferation of technology has led to distinct changes in how individuals engage with the world around them. People now shop, communicate, and share information in digital  formats,  which  was  previously  impossible.  Additional  changes  in  behavior  are likely  to  continue  in  the  face  of  technological  innovations  as  they  are  developed  and implemented.  In  fact,  the  sociologist  Howard  Odum  referred  to  this  process  as technicways, recognizing the ways in which behavior patterns change in response to, or as  consequence  of,  technological  innovations   Odum,  1937;  Parker,  1943;  Vance,  1972 . From  Odum’s  perspective,  technic-ways  replace  existing  behavior  patterns  and  force institutional changes in society  Vance, 1972 . For instance, if an individual 30 years ago wanted to communicate with other people, he she might call them, see them in person if possible,  or  more  likely  send  a  letter  through  postal  mail.  Now,  however,  that  person  17   would  send  a  text,  write  an  email,  instant  message,  or  poke  them  through  Facebook rather than write a letter through “snail mail.”  The  impacts  of  technicways  are  evident  across  all  demographic  groups  in  modern society.  For  instance,  77  percent  of  Americans  owned  a  smart  phone  as  of  2016,  with substantial access among younger populations: 92 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds have one  Smith,  2017 .  In  addition,  there  are  over  1  billion  mobile  phone  subscribers  each  in China and India  Rai, 2016 . Importantly, China has over 500 million smartphone users, while  India  has  only  125  million.  As  these  rates  continue  to  increase  Internet  use  will change, transforming social and economic interactions in unique ways from country to country  Rai, 2016 .  This is evident in the fact that many people around the world use social media as a means to connect and engage with others in different ways. For instance, 79 percent of American adults use Facebook, though there has been a substantial increase in the use of Instagram and LinkedIn as a means to communicate  Greenwood, Perrin, and Duggan, 2016 . Adults aged 65 and older are joining these sites at the highest rates compared to other  age  groups.  In  addition,  Americans  appear  to  use  the  Facebook  messenger  app more  than  any  other  product  available   Schwartz,  2016 .  WhatsApp  is  much  more popular in a global context, and is the number one messaging application across much of South  America,  Western  Europe,  Africa,  and  Asia.  Viber,  however,  is  much  more popular  across  Eastern  Europe,  particularly  Belarus,  Ukraine,  and  other  nations  in  the region  Schwartz, 2016 .  Despite  regional  variations  in  use,  technology  has  had  a  massive  impact  on  youth populations  who  have  never  experienced  life  without  the  Internet  and  computer- mediated communications  CMCs   like  email  and  texting.  Today,  youth  in  the  USA acquire  their  first  cell  phones  when  they  are  between  the  ages  of  12  and  13   Lenhart, 2010 .  Similar  use  patterns  are  evident  across  the  globe,  with  children  in  the  UK receiving  a  phone  by  an  average  age  of  11   Gibbs,  2013 ,  and  12  in  a  study  of  Japan, India, Indonesia, Egypt, and Chile  GSM Association, 2012 .  18   For  more  information  on  statistics  of  social  media  and  technology  use,  go online to:  1.  www.pewinternet.org  2.  www.huffingtonpost.com april-rudin life-on-a-social-media-  is_b_4600429.html  Technology has not simply shifted the behaviors of youth, but has actually shaped and molded their behavior and worldview from the start. Most people born in the mid- to late  1980s  have  never  lived  without  computers,  the  Internet,  or  cell  phones.  As  a consequence,  they  do  not  know  a  world  without  these  devices  and  what  life  was  like without  these  resources.  Thus,  Prensky   2001   argued  that  these  youth  are  digital natives,  in  that  they  were  brought  into  a  world  that  was  already  digital,  spend  large amounts of time in digital environments, and use technological resources in their day-to- day  lives.  For  instance,  individuals  between  the  ages  of  18  and  34  are  the  most  heavy Internet users worldwide  Statistica, 2015 . Virtually everyone  96%  aged 16 to 24 in the UK accesses the Internet on a mobile device  Office for National Statistics, 2015 . Young people  are  also  more  likely  to  use  auto-delete  messaging  applications  like  Snapchat, comprising 56 percent of Internet users in a recent US study  Greenwood et al., 2016 . In fact,  youth  in  India  and  Indonesia  send  an  average  of  51  text  or  application-based messages a day via a mobile device  GSM Association, 2012 .  By contrast, digital immigrants are those who were born prior to the creation of the Internet and digital technologies  Prenksy, 2001 . These individuals quite often need to adapt to the digital environment, which changes much more rapidly than they may be prepared for otherwise. This is especially true for many older individuals who were born decades  before  the  creation  and  advent  of  these  technologies.  As  a  consequence,  they may be less willing to immediately adopt these resources or use them in diverse ways. For instance, only 45 percent of adults in the USA over the age of 65 own either a laptop or desktop computer  Zickuhr, 2011 . In addition, some resources may be more difficult for  digital  immigrants  to  understand  because  of  the  technologies  employed  or  their perceived utility. For example, only 9 percent of US adults aged 50 and older were likely to  use  an  app  like  Snapchat,  and  less  than  1  percent  accessed  services  like  YikYak  Greenwood et al., 2016 . Similarly, only 29 percent of people aged 65 years and older in the UK used the Internet on a mobile device  Office for National Statistics, 2015 . Thus, digital  immigrants  have  a  very  different  pattern  of  adoption  and  use  of  technologies relative to digital natives.  The  proliferation  of  technology  in  modern  society  has  had  a  massive  impact  on human behavior. The world is being restructured around the use of CMCs, affecting the way in which we interact with governments, businesses, and one another. In addition,  19   technology use is also creating a divide between generations based on the way in which individuals  use  technology  in  their  day-to-day  lives.  In  turn,  individuals  are  adapting their  behavior  in  ways  that  subvert  the  original  beneficial  design  and  application  of computers and the Internet.  20   Technology as a landscape for crime  The continuing evolution of human behavior as a result of technological innovations has created  unparalleled  opportunities  for  crime  and  misuse.  Over  the  past  three  decades, there  has  been  a  substantive  increase  in  the  use  of  technology  by  street  criminals  and novel  applications  of  technology  to  create  new  forms  of  crime  that  did  not  previously exist. The World Wide Web and the Internet also provide a venue for individuals who engage  in  crime  and  deviance  to  communicate  and  share  information,  which  is  not otherwise possible in the real world. As a result, it is vital that we begin to understand how these changes are occurring, and what this means for offending in the twenty-first century. There are three key ways in which computer and cellular technologies may be abused or subverted by offenders:  1.  as a medium for communication and the development of subcultures online; 2.  as a mechanism to target sensitive resources and engage in crime and deviance; 3.  as  an  incidental  device  to  facilitate  the  offense  and  provide  evidence  of  criminal activity both online and offline.  Technology as a communications medium  The Internet, telephony, and digital media may be used as a means for communication between  individuals  in  a  rapid  and  decentralized  fashion  across  the  globe.  Computers, cell  phones,  and  technological  equipment  may  be  obtained  at  minimal  cost  and  used with a high degree of anonymity. For instance, major retailers and convenience stores sell phones that may be used without a contract through a carrier like Sprint or Verizon. The ability to use the phone depends on the number of minutes purchased and it can be disposed of after use.  In turn, criminals can use these devices to connect with others and share information that may be of interest. For example, the customers of prostitutes use web forums and chatrooms to discuss where sex workers are located, services provided, pricing, and the police presence in a given area  Holt and Blevins, 2007; Holt, Blevins, and Kuhns, 2008; Sharp and Earle, 2003 . This exchange of first-hand information is difficult to conduct in the  real  world,  as  there  are  no  outward  signs  to  otherwise  suggest  that  someone  is interested  in  or  has  visited  a  prostitute.  In  addition,  there  is  a  high  degree  of  social stigma  and  shame  surrounding  paying  for  sex,  so  it  is  unlikely  that  someone  would admit  this  behavior  to  another  person  in  public   McKeganey  and  Barnard,  1996; O’Connell  Davidson,  1998 .  The  faceless,  anonymous  nature  of  the  Internet,  however, allows people to talk about such actions with little risk of harm or reprisal.  The sale of illicit narcotics like cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamines has also  21   moved online with the development of markets where individuals buy and sell narcotics through various methods. The primary resources used by sellers and buyers are forums operating on the so-called Dark Web, which is a portion of the Internet that can only be accessed  via  the  use  of  specialized  encryption  software  and  browser  protocols. Individuals can only access these forums through the use of The Onion Router, or TOR service,  which  is  a  free  proxy  and  encryption  protocol  that  hides  the  IP  address  and location  details  of  the  user   Barratt,  Ferris,  and  Winstock,  2014;  Dolliver,  2015 .  In addition, the content of these sites cannot be indexed by google or other search engines. As a result, this technology limits the ability of law enforcement agencies to eliminate illicit content because the hosting source cannot be identified through traditional means  Dolliver, 2015; Estes, 2014 .  For  more  information  on  TOR,  including  how  it  operates,  go  online  to: www.torproject.org about overview.html.en.  One of the first Tor-based narcotics markets that gained prominence was called the Silk Road. The market gained attention from researchers and the popular media due to the nature of the products sold, and the fact that transactions were paid using bitcoins, a relatively anonymous form of electronic currency  Franklin, 2013 . The site was created to  enable  individuals  to  buy  various  materials  ranging  from  computer  equipment  to clothing, though sellers offered various narcotics from locations across the globe. In fact, its  name  was  a  reference  to  the  trade  routes  used  to  transport  goods  between  Europe, India, and Asia throughout history  Franklin, 2013 .  As the Silk Road gained prominence as a venue for the sale of various narcotics, law enforcement agencies in both the USA and Australia conducted sting operations against buyers.  In  fact,  since  it  opened  in  2011  the  Silk  Road  enabled  over  one  million transactions  worth  an  estimated  $1.2  billion  in  revenue   Barratt,  2012 .  An  FBI investigation into the site administrator, who used the handle Dread Pirate Roberts, led to  the  arrest  of  Ross  William  Ulbricht  in  San  Francisco,  California  on  October  2,  2013  Gibbs,  2013 .  Ulbricht  was  charged  with  drug  trafficking,  soliciting  murder,  enabling computer  hacking  and  money  laundering,  and  had  several  million  dollars’  worth  of bitcoins seized.  22   For  more  information  on  the  arrest  of  Dread  Pirate  Roberts,  go  online  to: http:  arstechnica.com tech-policy 2013 10 how-the-feds-took-down-the-dread- pirate-roberts .  The  Silk  Road  demonstrates  that  the  distributed  nature  of  the  Internet  and  CMCs enables  individuals  to  connect  to  other  people  and  groups  that  share  similar  likes, dislikes, behaviors, opinions, and values. As a result, technology facilitates the creation of subcultures between individuals based on common behaviors and ideals regardless of geographic  or  social  isolation.  From  a  sociological  and  criminological  perspective, subcultures are groups that have their own values, norms, traditions, and rituals which set them apart from the dominant culture  Kornblum, 1997; Brake, 1980 .  Participants in subcultures generate their own codes of conduct to structure the ways in  which  they  interact  with  other  members  of  the  subculture  and  different  groups  in society   Foster,  1990 .  In  addition,  membership  in  a  subculture  influences  individual behavior  by  providing  beliefs,  goals,  and  values  that  approve  of  and  justify  activity  Herbert, 1998 . For instance, a subculture may emphasize the development of skills and abilities  that  may  find  less  value  in  the  general  culture,  like  an  ability  to  use  multiple programming  languages  and  manipulate  hardware  and  software  among  computer hackers  Holt, 2007; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Taylor, 1999 . Members of a subculture also have their own argot or slang to communicate with others and protect their discussions from  outsiders   Maurer,  1981 .  The  use  of  this  language  can  serve  as  a  practical demonstration  of  membership  in  any  subculture.  Thus,  subcultures  provide  members with a way to gauge their reputation, status, and adherence to the values and beliefs of the group.  There  are  myriad  subcultures  in  modern  society,  many  involving  both  online  and offline  experiences.  However,  not  all  subcultures  are  deviant,  and  you  can  also  be  a member of several subcultures at once. For instance, you may belong to a subculture of sports team fans  whether football, basketball, or any athletics  if you:  1  enjoy watching their games,  2  know the statistics for your favorite players,  3  know the historic events in your team’s previous seasons, and  4  you debate with others over who may be the best  players  in  certain  positions.  Similar  subcultures  exist  for  gardening,  fashion,  cars, movies, and other behaviors. Finding others who share your interests can be beneficial, as it allows for social connectivity and a way to channel your interests in positive ways.  23   For examples of various subcultures with a heavy online presence, go online to: http:  abcnews.go.com ABC_Univision Entertainment subcultures-strong-online- presence story?id=185115941.  In  much  the  same  way,  subcultures  can  emerge  on  and  offline  for  those  with  an interest in certain forms of crime and deviance  Quinn and Forsyth, 2005 . Technology allows individuals to connect to others without fear of reprisal or social rejection, and even enables individuals who are curious about a behavior or activity to learn more in an  online  environment  without  fear  of  detection   Blevins  and  Holt,  2009;  Holt,  2007; Quinn  and  Forsyth,  2005 .  New  technologies  also  enable  the  formation  of  and participation in multiple subcultures with greater ease than is otherwise possible offline. In fact, individuals can readily communicate subcultural knowledge through email and other CMCs, such as techniques of offending, which may reduce their risk of detection from victims and law enforcement  Holt et al., 2008; Holt and Copes, 2010 . Because of the  prominence  of  technology  as  a  means  to  communicate  with  others,  this  book  will focus  extensively  on  the  role  of  online  subcultures  to  facilitate  crime  and  deviance  in virtual and real-world environments.  For more information on the current state of online subcultures, go online to: www.highsnobiety.com 2015 03 11 internet-subcultures-health-goth-seapunk .  Technology as a target of or means to engage in crime  The  second  way  in  which  technology  can  be  misused  is  much  more  insidious  –  as  a  24   resource  for  individuals  to  attack  and  to  cause  harm  to  individuals,  businesses,  and governments both online and offline. Many devices in our daily lives have the capability to connect to the Internet, from mp3 players to desktop computers. These technologies contain sensitive pieces of information, ranging from our shopping habits to usernames and passwords for bank and email accounts. Since these devices can communicate with one another, individuals can potentially gain access to this information through various methods of computer hacking  see Chapter 3 for more details .  While hacking is often thought to involve highly skilled individuals with a significant understanding  of  technology,  the  simple  act  of  guessing  someone’s  email  or  computer password  could  be  defined  as  a  hack   Bossler  and  Burruss,  2011;  Skinner  and  Fream, 1997 .  Gaining  unauthorized  access  to  personal  information  online  is  often  key  to definitions  of  hacking,  as  an  individual  is  attempting  to  gain  entry  into  protected systems or data  see Schell and Dodge, 2002; Wall, 2001 . In turn, that information, such as who a person talks to or which financial institution they choose for banking purposes, can be used to cause additional harm. In fact, research on college students suggests that between  10  and  25  percent  of  undergraduates  have  tried  to  guess  someone  else’s password   Holt,  Burruss,  and  Bossler  2010;  Rogers,  Smoak,  and  Liu,  2006;  Skinner  and Fream,  1997 .  Thus,  the  information  that  can  be  assembled  about  our  activities  online may be compromised and used by others to cause financial or emotional harm.

Often, the hacker and activist community use web  defacement  in  order  to  spread  a  message  and  cause  harm  at  the  same  time  Brenner, 2008; Denning, 2001, 2011; Kilger, 2011 . Web defacements are an act of online vandalism wherein an individual replaces the existing HTML code for a web page with an  image  and  message  that  they  create.  For  example,  a  person  may  try  to  deface  the website  for  the  White  House   www.whitehouse.gov   and  replace  the  content  with  a message  that  they  want  others  to  see.  Although  this  is  an  inconvenience  and embarrassment  to  the  site  owner,  it  may  be  more  malicious  if  the  defacer  chooses  to delete the original content entirely.  Defacements have become a regular tool for politically motivated hackers and actors  25   to express their opinions, and have been used around many hot-button social events. For instance,  the  Turkish  hacker  community  began  a  widespread  campaign  of  web defacements  following  the  publication  of  a  cartoon  featuring  an  image  of  the  prophet Mohammed  with  a  bomb  in  his  turban   Holt,  2009;  Ward,  2006 .  Many  Muslims  were deeply offended by this image, and Turkish hackers began to deface websites owned by the  Danish  newspaper  which  published  the  cartoon,  along  with  any  other  site  that reposted the image. The defacements were conducted in support of the Islamic religion and  to  express  outrage  over  the  way  in  which  their  faith  was  being  portrayed  in  the popular media  Holt, 2009; Ward, 2006 . Thus, motivated actors who want to cause harm or express an opinion may view various resources online as a target.

Defining computer misuse and abuse  Since  technology  may  be  used  both  as  a  communications  medium  and  a  target  for attacks against digital targets and infrastructure, it is vital to delineate what constitutes the abuse and misuse of technology. For instance, the term deviance is used to refer to a behavior that may not be illegal, though it is outside of the formal and informal norms or  beliefs  of  the  prevailing  culture.  There  are  many  forms  of  deviance,  depending  on societal norms and societal contexts. For instance, texting and using Facebook while in class may not be illegal, but it is disruptive and generally frowned upon by faculty and administrators. The same is true in movie theaters and other public settings. Therefore, texting  and  using  Facebook  could  be  viewed  as  deviant  in  the  context  of  certain situations and locations, but may not be illegal otherwise. The fact that this activity is engendered by technology may allow it to be referred to as cyberdeviance.  A  more  pertinent  example  of  cyberdeviance  is  evident  in  the  creation  and  use  of pornography.  The  Internet  has  made  it  exceedingly  easy  for  individuals  to  view pornographic images and videos, as well as to make these materials through the use of webcams,  cell  phone  cameras,  and  digital  photography.  It  is  legal  for  anyone  over  the age of 18 to either access pornographic images or star in these films and media. If the larger  community  shares  the  view  that  pornography  is  morally  wrong,  then  viewing  26   these  materials  may  be  considered  deviant  in  that  area.  Therefore,  it  is  not  illegal  to engage in this activity; rather it simply violates local norms and belief systems, making it a deviant behavior.  Activities that violate codified legal statutes move from deviance to criminal acts. In the context of pornography, if an individual is under the age of 18 in the USA, they are not legally allowed to either create or view pornographic images. Therefore, such an act is considered a crime because it carries legal sanctions. The criminal statutes in the USA at both the state and federal level recognize a variety of offenses in the real world.  The  rapid  adoption  and  use  of  technology  in  order  to  facilitate  criminal  activity, however,  have  led  to  the  creation  of  several  terms  in  order  to  properly  classify  these behaviors.  Specifically,  cybercrime  and  computer  crime  emerged  a  few  decades  ago  to refer  to  the  unique  way  in  which  technology  is  used  to  facilitate  criminal  activity. Cybercrime  refers  to  crimes  “in  which  the  perpetrator  uses  special  knowledge  of cyberspace,”  while  computer  crimes  occur  because  “the  perpetrator  uses  special knowledge about computer technology”  Furnell, 2002: 21; Wall, 2001 . In the early days of computing, the difference between these terms was useful to clarify how technology was incorporated into the offense. The fact that almost every computer is now connected to the Internet in some way has diminished the need to segment these two acts  Wall, 2007 . In addition, they have become virtually synonymous in both academic circles and popular media. As a result, this book will use the term “cybercrime” due to the range of crimes that can occur through the use of online environments and the massive number of computers and mobile devices that are connected to the Internet.  The  borderless  nature  of  the  Internet  complicates  the  criminal  justice  response  to crime  and  deviance,  since  the  ways  in  which  nations  define  an  act  do  not  generally hinder individuals from accessing content. Using the example of pornography, it is legal to  produce  and  access  this  content  in  the  USA  and  in  most  other  parts  of  the  globe. Islamic majority nations like Iran and Saudi Arabia, however, have banned and made it illegal  to  access  pornography  due  to  their  religious  beliefs   Wall,  2001,  2007 .  Other countries  like  Sweden,  however,  place  minimal  restrictions  on  the  production  of pornographic content, including images of animals or “bestiality.” Although it is illegal to  create  or  view  this  content  in  the  USA  and  in  most  other  nations,  individuals  can access  bestiality,  violent,  or  unusual  pornographic  material  from  across  the  globe, regardless  of  their  nation’s  laws,  due  to  the  connectivity  afforded  by  the  Internet  Brenner,  2008;  Wall,  2007 .  Thus,  it  is  difficult  to  restrict  or  enforce  local  laws  on individual conduct because of the ability to access content globally.  27   Fig. 1.1 Venn diagram of cybercrime, cyberterrorism, and cyberdeviance  The  intersection  of  cybercrime  and  cyberdeviance  is  also  related  to  the  emerging problem of cyberterrorism   see  Figure  1.1  for  details .  This  term  emerged  in  the  mid- 1990s as technology began to play an increasingly significant role in all aspects of society  Denning,  2001;  Britz,  2010 .  There  is  no  single  accepted  definition  of  cyberterrorism, though  many  recognize  this  behavior  as  the  use  of  digital  technology  or  computer- mediated communications to cause harm and force social change based on ideological or political beliefs  Brenner, 2008; Britz, 2010 . Although there are few known incidents of cyberterrorism that have occurred over the past two decades, the ubiquity of technology could  allow  extremist  groups  like  Al  Qaeda  to  target  military  systems  containing sensitive  information,  financial  service  systems  that  engender  commerce,  power  grids, switching stations, and other critical infrastructure necessary to maintain basic services. Criminals  may  also  attack  these  targets  using  similar  tactics,  making  it  difficult  to separate acts of cyberterror from cybercrime  Brenner, 2008 .  For more information on the technologies supporting power grids, go online to: www.tofinosecurity.com blog scada-cyber-securityinternational-issue.  In order to classify these phenomena, it is necessary to consider both the motive of the attacker  and  the  scope  of  harm  caused.  For  instance,  criminal  acts  often  target  single  28   individuals  and  may  be  motivated  by  economic  or  other  objectives,  whereas  terrorist attacks are often driven by a political motive and are designed to not only hurt or kill innocents but also to strike fear into the larger population  Brenner, 2008; Britz, 2010 . In addition, the communications capability afforded by the Internet creates an interesting intersection between cyberdeviance and cyberterror. For example, members of extremist and  hate  groups  increasingly  depend  on  web  forums  and  blogs  to  post  their  views  to audiences across the globe. In fact, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant  ISIS  uses Twitter and other social media platforms as a means to recruit and radicalize individuals, as well as to promote their agenda  see Chapter 10 for more details . The laws of a given country may not allow such language, as in Germany where it is illegal to post Nazi- related content  Wall, 2001 . In the USA, though, such speech is protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution; therefore, the act of using online forums to express an opinion largely unsupported by society is deviant rather than illegal behavior.  It  is  not  always  possible  to  identify  cleanly  and  clearly  the  nature  of  some cyberattacks,  as  is  evident  in  the  substantial  number  of  attacks  by  hackers  around  the world who belong to the collective Anonymous. The origins of Anonymous stem from the image board 4chan, where people upload and share images with one another without revealing  any  personal  information  about  themselves   Olson,  2012 .  Individuals continuously posting pictures without identifying themselves led to the popularity of the idea  of  Anonymous  as  a  real  person.  This  crystallized  in  2004  when  one  of  the  4chan administrators implemented a “Forced_Anon” protocol signing all posts to Anonymous  Olson,  2012 .  As  a  result,  this  led  to  the  acceptance  of  a  collective  identity  of Anonymous  centering  on  the  idea  that  the  Internet  is  an  outlet  that  has  no  limits  or boundaries.  The group encourages awareness and recognition of individuals who are engaging in either  illicit  activities  or  unacceptable  actions  that  harm  society.  There  is  no  way  to identify  a  member  of  Anonymous;  instead  they  are  a  collection  of  individuals  who support  an  idea  or  goal  without  the  need  for  individual  recognition   Olson,  2012 .  In most of their online communications, they use the following language as an expression of  these  values:  “We  are  Anonymous.  We  are  Legion.  We  do  not  forgive.  We  do  not forget. Expect us.” The group also uses Guy Fawkes masks and a body wearing a black suit with a question mark for a head in representation of the anonymous nature of the group. There is also no necessary leadership of Anonymous.  They  are  often  perceived  as  hacktivists  in  the  general  media,  since  they  use  DDoS attacks, group-based research, email hacking, and other techniques in order to affect a target. For instance, one of the first targets of the group was a white supremacist radio show host named Hal Turner. Members of Anonymous DDoSed his site offline, causing thousands  of  dollars  in  losses   Olson,  2012 .  A  subsequent  attack  by  individuals associated with Anonymous targeted the Support Online Hip Hop  SOHH  website and its  forums.  Individuals  in  the  SOHH  forum  made  disparaging  comments  against Anonymous in June 2008. Their website was then attacked in two stages. The first attack used  DDoS  tools  to  knock  out  access  followed  by  a  series  of  web  defacements  adding  29   Nazi  images  and  racial  language  to  change  the  site  content   Reid,  2008 .  Shortly thereafter, Anonymous accessed and shared personal information for a teenage boy who ran  the  site  “No  Cussing  Club”   Olson,  2012 .  The  boy’s  family  was  harassed  by individuals associated with the group, including hate mail and obscene phone calls.  Following  these  attacks,  the  focus  of  Anonymous  turned  toward  social  activism  in support of free access to information. For instance, the group engaged in a DDoS attack against  multiple  targets  in  both  the  music  and  private  industries  in  a  campaign  called “Operation  Payback.”  The  attacks  began  in  September  2010  as  retaliation  against  anti- piracy initiatives started by media companies in order to reduce access to copyrighted materials online. The attacks expanded to include Sony and their PlayStation Network in 2011. The company began to crack down on attempts to pirate games and media, such as a  lawsuit  against  a  hacker  who  released  information  on  techniques  to  download PlayStation 2 video games  Olson, 2012 . Anonymous members used the Low Orbit Ion Cannon  attack  tool  to  engage  in  a  DDoS  campaign  that  took  down  the  Play-Station Network  for  hours  and  days  at  a  time.  They  also  accessed  and  released  personal information of PlayStation users obtained by hacking  Olson, 2012 . Their involvement in a  variety  of  attacks  and  hacktivist  operations  has  continued  throughout  the  past  few years, targeting governments, law enforcement, and industrial targets.  Taken  as  a  whole,  Anonymous  does  not  appear  to  hack  for  economic  gain.  The absence  of  consistent  ideological  justifications  for  their  Anonymous  actions  makes  it difficult to classify their attacks as acts of cyberterrorism. Although scholars differ as to whether Anonymous constitutes cybercriminals or terrorists, their actions demonstrate that  cybercrime,  terror,  and  deviance  are  all  interrelated  and  share  common  elements due to the nature of online environments.  What makes cybercrime and deviance attractive?  The  rise  of  cyberdeviance,  cybercrime,  and  cyberterror  has  led  many  to  question  why some people choose to engage in wrongdoing in virtual environments. There are several unique factors that may account for offending online, most especially the availability of technology in the modern world. First and foremost, the ubiquity of technology makes it easy for individuals to gain access to the tools necessary to offend with relative ease. The prices of laptop and desktop computers have dropped substantially over the past decade, making it easy to acquire this equipment. For instance, the price of laptop PCs decreased from an average of $1,640 in 2001 to $1,000 in 2005  Associated Press, 2005 . The price has continued  to  drop,  and  these  devices  now  compete  with  even  smaller  portable computers,  like  the  iPad  and  smart  phones,  that  can  connect  to  the  Internet  through cellular  technology.  As  a  result,  offenders  can  readily  acquire  and  access  information from anywhere through these resources. If a person cannot afford to buy these devices on their own, they can always use computers in Internet cafés and public libraries for free  or  for  a  small  cost.  Thus,  there  are  minimal  barriers  to  computer  technology  30   globally.  In  addition,  there  is  a  wide  range  of  cybercrimes  that  can  be  performed  dependent upon the individual’s technical skill. Some forms of cybercrime require a great deal of skill  and  proficiency,  though  simple  offenses  may  be  performed  with  minimal investment on the part of the offender. For instance, anyone can download pirated music or movies from online environments or post an ad for sexual encounters on craigslist or another website.  Technology also acts as a force multiplier in that computers and CMCs allow a single person to engage in crimes that otherwise involve multiple people or complex schemes in order to target victims  Brenner, 2008; Taylor, Fritsch, Liederbach, and Holt, 2010 . For instance, if a criminal attempts to rob a person in the real world, they must often target single individuals due to the difficulty in intimidating and managing groups of people. The offender must also try to determine in advance if the individual he is attempting to rob has money, jewelry, or other goods that are of value.  In  online  environments,  offenders  can  target  thousands  of  victims  at  a  time, worldwide,  within  seconds.  For  example,  individuals  regularly  send  out  unsolicited emails, called spam, to thousands of victims using addresses harvested from information posted on public websites  Holt and Graves, 2007; King and Thomas, 2009; Wall, 2004 . For instance, public universities often post the addresses of professors, faculty, and staff on their websites. In turn, individuals can copy and collate these addresses into lists and use them to send a variety of different spam messages. In fact, one of the most common forms  of  spam  message  appears  to  originate  in  part  from  Nigeria,  where  the  sender claims to be foreign royalty, bankers, or attorneys who need assistance in moving large sums  of  money   Holt  and  Graves,  2007;  King  and  Thomas,  2009;  Wall,  2004 .  They request information from the email recipients like names, addresses, phone numbers, and bank account details so that they can reuse the information to commit identity theft or bank  fraud.  Since  few  people  fall  for  this  sort  of  scheme,  sending  out  thousands  of messages increases the likelihood that a victim may respond. Thus, fraudsters increase the likelihood of success by targeting thousands of victims simultaneously.  For  more  information  on  the  rate  of  spam  distribution,  go  online  to: https:  securelist.com all ?category=442.  The  risk  of  detection  from  law  enforcement  is  much  lower  in  online  environments  31   than in the real world. Offenders in the real world must take several steps to reduce the likelihood that their actual identity can be determined. For example, robbers may wear a mask or baggy clothing to conceal their face and build  Miller, 1998; Wright and Decker, 1997 . They may also try to disguise their voice by speaking in a higher or lower tone. Victims  may  be  able  to  recall  information  about  the  offender  and  video  cameras  may capture the incident on film, making it harder to hide the offense from police.  These issues are largely absent in online environments, since it is easier for offenders to  conceal  their  real  identity   Wall,  2001 .  The  faceless  nature  of  the  Internet  makes  it easy  for  individuals  to  hide  their  gender,  age,  or  race  in  various  ways.  A  profile  in  a social  networking  site  like  Facebook  or  email  account  can  be  created  using  false information through Google, Yahoo, or Hotmail. This false account may be used to send threatening  or  harassing  messages  to  others  to  help  conceal  their  true  identity   Bocij, 2004 . Similarly, various technological resources are designed to hide a person’s location from others. For example, Tor, the service used by individuals to access the Silk Road, is a form of proxy server that may be used to hide a computer’s location by acting as an intermediary  between  a  computer  and  the  servers  and  systems  to  which  it  connects through the Internet. If we try to access Google from a PC using a proxy, the command will be routed through a service that will make the request on our behalf and send the information back to us. In turn, the servers at Google will not register our computer as the one making the request, but rather associate it with the proxy server. Some offenders are even able to route their web and email traffic through other people’s computers in order to minimize the likelihood that they are caught  see Chapter 4 for more details .  For more on proxy servers, go online to:  1.  www.publicproxyservers.com. 2.  http:  proxy4free.com.  32   Cybercrimes  are  also  attractive  for  some  actors  based  on  the  laws  of  their  nation. Since  individuals  can  target  victims  across  the  world,  local  laws  make  a  significant difference to who and what an offender targets. Many industrialized nations have laws against cybercrimes, increasing the risk of prosecution and investigation for offenders if caught  Brenner, 2008 . Therefore, attacking people within that country may increase the likelihood of being prosecuted. If, however, a country does not allow their citizens to be extradited  to  another  country  to  face  prosecution  for  crimes,  then  the  actor  cannot  be successfully  investigated   Brenner,  2008 .  For  instance,  there  is  no  treaty  allowing Russian citizens who engage in attacks against US citizens to be brought to the USA for prosecution. Russian criminals cannot be extradited for these offenses and may generally receive  no  punishment  for  their  actions   see  Box  1.1  for  an  example .  In  turn,  it  is extremely difficult to deter or sanction cybercriminals in foreign countries, which may encourage attacks against certain countries with no consequences.  Box 1.1 Getting around Russian extradition laws  www.nbcnews.com id 3078784.WNbZom_ytQI.  FBI agent charged with hacking  Russia alleges agent broke law by downloading evidence  In a first in the rapidly evolving field of cyberspace law, Russia’s counterintelligence service on Thursday filed criminal charges against an FBI agent it says lured two Russian hackers to the United States, then illegally seized evidence against them by downloading data from their computers in Chelyabinsk, Russia.  This  article  provides  interesting  insights  into  the  challenges  posed  by  cybercrime investigations that cross national boundaries.  By contrast, some developing nations may not have laws against computer misuse. If there are no laws, then the nation serves as a sort of “safe haven” for actors where they can  operate  with  minimal  risk  of  legal  sanctions   Brenner,  2008;  Holt,  2003 .  This  was exemplified in the creation of the ILOVEYOU virus that spread around the world in 2000. This form of malware attacked millions of computers and spread through infected email attachments, effectively crippling the Internet at the time  Poulsen, 2010 . The program  33   started in the Philippines on May 4, 2000 and spread across the world in a single day. It is thought  to  have  been  created  by  a  Filipino  college  student  named  Onel  de  Guzman, based  on  the  start  of  the  program  from  Manila  and  his  interest  in  hacking   Poulsen, 2010 .  At  the  time,  there  were  no  laws  against  writing  malware  in  the  Philippines, making prosecutors unable to pursue de Guzman. Thus, the absence of laws can make it extremely difficult to combat cybercrimes internationally.  Taken as a whole, the global reach of the Internet has created substantial difficulties for law enforcement agencies at home and abroad to enforce cybercrime laws globally. The  structure  of  policing,  especially  in  the  USA,  establishes  guidelines  for  the investigation of crimes at the local, state, and federal level. Offenses that occur within a single  jurisdictional  boundary  are  often  the  responsibility  of  local  municipal  police departments or sheriffs’ departments, while those that cross state or national boundaries are handled by state or federal agencies. Many cybercriminals may not live within the same  region  as  their  victim   Holt,  2003;  Wall,  1998 ,  though,  even  if  they  were  in  the same region, a victim may have no idea where the offender actually resides. This creates significant confusion as to the appropriate agency to contact, and diminishes the amount of  cybercrime  reported  to  law  enforcement   Goodman,  1997;  Wall,  1998 .  In  fact,  this under-counting is referred to as “the dark figure” of cybercrime, in that the true number of offenses is unknown.  One  reason  for  the  lack  of  reporting  is  the  inherent  difficulty  in  recognizing  when illegal activities have taken place. Individuals may be completely unaware that they have been  the  victim  of  cybercrime  until  it  is  too  late.  For  example,  failures  in  computer hardware and software may be either the result of an error in the equipment, or a direct result of criminal activities designed to hide their occurrence. Many in the general public do not have the skills necessary to discern the root cause, making it hard to know when some  sort  of  compromise  has  taken  place.  Since  cybercriminals  attempt  to  target  as many victims as possible, it is also difficult to identify any patterns for risky behavior online  Bossler and Holt, 2009 . Finally, protective software programs designed to reduce individual  risk  of  victimization  do  not  always  work.  Approximately  25  percent  of personal  computers  around  the  world  that  use  a  variety  of  security  solutions  have malicious software, such as a virus, loaded into their memory  PandaLabs, 2007 .  The  embarrassment,  shame,  or  harm  that  may  come  from  reporting  cybercrime victimization  also  reduces  the  likelihood  of  contacting  law  enforcement.  For  instance, Nigerian email scams often target naïve individuals who believe that an unlikely claim may  be  valid.  Reporting  that  they  have  been  defrauded  may  be  substantially embarrassing  and  thereby  diminish  the  likelihood  of  reporting.  Within  corporate  and government  computing  environments,  there  are  several  issues  that  may  reduce  the likelihood of reporting when a cybercrime has occurred. For instance, a company may lose  customers  or  overall  stock  value  if  they  report  that  their  systems  have  been compromised.  Embarrassment  over  the  loss  of  sensitive  information  may  engender cover-ups or diminished reporting in order to reduce the loss of business.  Taken as a whole, technology affords multiple unique advantages for offenders that  34   are not necessarily present in the real world. Technology is readily available across the globe, providing offenders with widespread access to resources. The number of people online  provides  a  wealth  of  prospective  victims  that  can  be  affected  with  greater  ease than is possible in the real world. Technology also offers people the ability to hide their actual  identity  behind  a  variety  of  false  names  and  locations,  making  it  difficult  to determine  who  is  responsible  for  a  criminal  incident.  Finally,  the  different  legal structures  and  cooperative  agreements  in  place  across  the  globe  make  it  difficult  to successfully prosecute cyber-crimes. As a result, individuals who engage in cybercrime and deviance face a much lower risk of detection and arrest, and may experience greater monetary or emotional rewards from cybercrime.

Technology as evidence  The  third  and  final  way  that  technology  may  be  used  in  the  course  of  an  offense  is through  its incidental  role  or  involvement  in  a  crime.  In  this  case,  the  computer  may either  be  involved  in  the  commission  of  a  crime  or  is  being  used  merely  as  a  storage device  Maras, 2012 . For instance, the presence of child pornography on a laptop or cell phone suggests that it is incidental to the offence. This information, wherever it is stored, constitutes digital evidence, defined as information that is either transferred or stored in a binary form  Casey, 2011 . Digital evidence may be anything from the browser history of an individual to the emails, chat logs, photos present on mobile phones, GPS devices, IoT devices, and cell phone cameras of both the victim and offenders  see Chapter  12 . Computers, in the traditional sense, are no longer the only devices capable of sending emails,  chatting,  and  browsing  the  Internet.  Tablets,  music  players,  and  various  other devices can be connected to the Internet and provide some evidence of an individual’s behaviors.  There  are  several  valuable  examples  that  help  clarify  what  is  digital  evidence  and when it may be pertinent for various forms of crime both online and offline  Clifford, 2006; Maras, 2012 . For example, BTK  Bind, Torture, Kill  was a serial killer in Kansas  USA   from  1974  until  2005  when  he  was  arrested  and  convicted  of  ten  homicides  35    Williams and Landwehr, 2006 . The killer murdered ten people in Kansas between 1974 and 1991 and then went dormant, though he constantly wrote letters to the media and police  describing  his  exploits.  The  investigation  went  cold,  though  the  BTK  Killer indicated that he had committed another murder that had not been attributed to him.  Police then began communicating directly with BTK, when the killer asked if it was possible to trace his identity on the basis of data on floppy disks. The agency erroneously said  that  they  could  not,  and  BTK  sent  them  a  disk  with  a  document  discussing  his behaviors.  Using  specialized  computer  forensic  software  to  help  process  the  data  and evidence  located  on  the  disk,  investigators  determined  the  location  of  the  computer where  the  disk  had  been  opened,  as  well  as  the  person  who  created  the  document.  In turn, they were able to develop detailed information about the killer and gather enough circumstantial evidence to suggest a prospective identity, which turned out to be a man named  Dennis  Rader.  He  was  subsequently  arrested  and  pled  guilty  to  the  murders, receiving ten consecutive life sentences, one for each murder  Williams and Landwehr, 2006 .  Digital  evidence  may  also  be  derived  from  online  sources  that  may  be  present  on websites and social media. In fact, digital evidence collected from social media sites, such as  Facebook  and  Twitter,  has  been  influential  in  law  enforcement  over  the  past  few years. Following the Vancouver Canucks’ loss to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup finals in 2011, a massive riot broke out in Vancouver with fans setting vehicles on fire, breaking windows, looting stores, and dancing atop overturned cars  CBC News, 2011 . Within hours of the riot, police received over 3,500 emails that included videos, photos, and  web  links  to  various  social  media  sites.  In  addition,  a  “Vancouver  Riot  Pics” Facebook page was created to identify those individuals involved in the riots by allowing the  public  to  “tag”  the  pictures  and  videos   Leger,  2011 .  More  than  100  people  were arrested through the assistance of social media.  With virtually every crime incorporating some form of digital evidence, it is up to law enforcement to be able to identify the possible sources of information and the locations where such information may be found. Various peripheral devices like flash drives, CDs, DVDs,  and  even  gaming  systems  may  contain  digital  evidence  that  can  be  collected. Some companies even produce removable storage media that are easily disguised, such as a pair of sunglasses or a wristband that contains a flash drive. With digital devices being increasingly used to target, act as a tool, or provide support for criminal activities, law enforcement and investigators must understand the nature of the digital crime scene.  more   For  www.trendhunter.com slideshow disguised-usb-drives.  hidden   media   on   devices,   go   online   to:  36   37   A typology of cybercrime  In light of the various ways in which technology engenders crime and deviance as well as fostering unique tactics for offending, it is necessary to understand the wide range of behaviors  that  constitute  cybercrime.  David  Wall   2001   created  one  of  the  most recognized  typologies  of  cybercrime,  which  encapsulates  behavior  into  one  of  four categories:  1  cyber-trespass;  2  cyber-deception and theft;  3  cyber-porn and obscenity; and  4  cyber-violence. These categories reference the wide range of deviant, criminal, and terrorist behaviors that have emerged using technology, as well as the subcultures supporting offenders throughout the world.  Cyber-trespass  The  first  category  is  cyber-trespass,  referring  to  the  act  of  crossing  boundaries  of ownership  in  online  environments.  This  may  seem  confusing  at  first.  If  you  go  to  a coffee  shop  or  restaurant,  you  may  notice  that  they  offer  free  Wi-Fi.  Their  network probably  has  a  name  they  chose  which  identifies  their  network  and  indicates  who manages and is responsible for that space. In order to use the service, you must join their network  and  accept  the  terms  of  service  that  may  come  up  when  you  open  your  web browser. In this instance, the coffee shop owns and manages this wireless network, but allows others to use the connectivity. By contrast, if the shop did not offer connectivity to customers, but you attempt to join and use their Wi-Fi anyway, you are trespassing because you are trying to break into the network that they own without the company’s permission.  The  issue  of  ownership  is  critical  in  instances  of  trespass,  especially  for  computer hackers  who  often  attempt  to  access  computer  systems,  email  accounts,  or  protected systems  that  they  do  not  own   Furnell,  2002;  Jordan  and  Taylor,  1998 .  Many  in  the general  public  recognize  hackers  for  their  involvement  in  criminal  acts  of  trespassing sensitive  boundaries  of  ownership,  contributing  to  the  belief  that  hackers  cause significant  harm  to  citizens,  industry,  and  government  alike.  Although  not  all  hackers engage in crime, those who do cost individuals and corporations a great deal of money each  year.  Individuals  who  are  interested  in  computer  hacking  operate  within  a  large online  subculture  with  participants  from  across  the  globe.  They  often  come  together online to discuss various techniques of hacking and their attitudes toward hacking with or  without  permission  from  system  owners.  Because  not  all  hackers  engage  in  crime, there is a rift within the subculture based on an individual’s willingness to engage in acts of cyber-trespass in support of hacking  see Chapter 3 for more details .  38   Cyber-deception and theft  The second category within Wall’s  2001  typology is cyber-deception and theft, which can extend from hacking and other forms of cyber-trespass. This category includes all the ways in which individuals may illegally acquire information or resources online, and often goes hand in hand with trespass. For instance, criminals can use email messages to acquire  bank  account  information  from  victims  through  the  use  of phishing  messages  James,  2005 .  In  this  case,  a  criminal  sends  a  message  claiming  to  be  from  a  bank  or financial  institution  which  needs  prospective  consumers  to  validate  their  account information by clicking on a web link provided in the message. The individuals are then sent to a fraudulent website that resembles the actual financial institution and are asked to  enter  their  bank  account  username,  login,  and  other  sensitive  information   James, 2005 . This data is then stored and used by the criminal to engage in fraud, or resold to others  through  an  online  black  market  for  stolen  data.  These  crimes  are  particularly costly  for  consumers  and  businesses;  a  recent  study  by  the  Ponemon  Institute   2015  found that a single phishing attack can cost an organization approximately $3.7 million due to losses in equipment, employee productivity, and mitigation costs.  The problem of digital piracy is also included in cyber-theft, encompassing the illegal copying  of  digital  media,  such  as  computer  software,  digital  sound  recordings,  and digital video recordings, without the explicit permission of the copyright holder  Gopal, Saunders,  Bhattacharjee,  Agrawal,  and  Wagner,  2004 .  The  financial  losses  stemming from  digital  piracy  are  quite  high.  For  instance,  one  company  estimates  that  the  US recording  industry  loses  over  $12  billion  each  year  from  piracy   Siwek,  2007 .  This  is because piracy is an extremely common activity, as evidenced by one study which found that between 50 and 90 percent of all broadband Internet traffic involved the transfer of pirated media  Siwek, 2007 . In addition, studies of college students in the USA find that between 40 and 60 percent of respondents have engaged in piracy within the past year  Gunter, 2009; Higgins, 2005; Hinduja, 2003; Skinner and Fream, 1997 .  For  more  information  on  the  problem  of  software  piracy,  go  online  to: http:  globalstudy.bsa.org 2016 index.html.  The  problem  of  piracy  appears  to  be  facilitated  in  large  part  by  the  subculture  of pirates  operating  online.  The  participants  in  this  subculture  help  break  copyright  39   protections on DVDs, Blu-ray disks, and software and distribute these materials online. In  fact,  individuals  can  access  pirated  media  and  software  through  various  outlets, including file-sharing services, torrents, and websites  Cooper and Harrison, 2001; Holt and Copes, 2010 . Participants in this subculture also encourage piracy by sharing their attitudes toward copyright law and minimizing the harm caused by pirating media  see Chapter 5 for details . Many young people believe that piracy is an acceptable behavior which  has  little  impact  on  artists  or  private  industry   Hinduja,  2003;  Ingram  and Hinduja,  2008 .  Thus,  cyber-deception  and  theft  involves  multiple  activities  that  cause significant financial harm.  Cyber-porn and obscenity  The  third  category  in  Wall’s  typology  of  cybercrime  is  cyber-porn  and  obscenity, representing the range of sexually expressive content online. As noted earlier, sexually explicit content is defined differently based on location. Thus, porn and obscenity may be  deviant  or  criminal  based  on  local  laws.  The  relatively  legal  nature  of  adult pornography has enabled the development of an extremely lucrative industry, thanks in part to the availability of streaming web content and high-speed connectivity  Edelman, 2009; Lane, 2000 . In addition, amateurs are increasingly active in the porn industry due to the ease with which individuals can produce professional quality images and media through  HD  digital  cameras,  web-enabled  cameras,  and  other  equipment   Lane,  2000 . While  viewing  pornographic  content  is  not  illegal  for  individuals  over  the  age  of  18, accessing  certain  content,  such  as  violent  or  animal-related  material,  may  be  criminal depending on local laws.  The ability to access pornographic content has also enabled the development of online subcultures  focused  on  various  deviant  sexual  activities.  Individuals  with  niche  sexual fetishes can identify multiple outlets to discuss their interests with others in web forums, email  lists,  and  online  groups  that  engender  the  exchange  of  information  in  near  real time  DiMarco, 2003 . In turn, these spaces help make people feel they are part of a larger group  that  validates  their  beliefs  and  attitudes.  Sexual  subcultures  can  also  move  into criminal activity when the actors victimize children and adults either online or offline. For instance, prostitutes increasingly use the Internet to advertise their services and keep in  touch  with  clients   Cunningham  and  Kendall,  2010 .  The  customers  of  sex  workers also use this technology in order to discuss their experiences, provide detailed accounts of their interactions, and warn others about police activities in a given area  Holt and Blevins,  2007;  Sharp  and  Earle,  2003 .  Similarly,  pedophiles  who  seek  out  sexual relationships  with  children  frequently  use  CMCs  in  order  to  identify  and  share pornographic and sexual images  Jenkins, 2001; Quayle and Taylor, 2002 . They may also use forums and instant messaging to connect with children in an attempt to move into offline  relationships   Wolak,  Finkelhor,  and  Mitchell,  2004;  Wolak,  Mitchell,  and Finkelhor, 2003 .  40   Cyber-violence  The final form within Wall’s typology is cyber-violence, referring to the ability to send or  access  injurious,  hurtful,  or  dangerous  materials  online.  This  may  encompass emotional harm such as embarrassment or shame, and in limited circumstances physical harm through suicidal ideation  Hinduja and Patchin, 2009 . For example, the volume of information available through social networking sites, coupled with the frequent use of CMCs, has increased the likelihood that individuals will be bullied, harassed, or stalked online  Finkelhor, Mitchell, and Wolak, 2000; Finn, 2004; Hinduja and Patchin, 2009; Holt and  Bossler,  2009 .  Individuals  from  various  age  groups  are  increasingly  receiving threatening  or  sexual  messages  via  email,  instant  message,  or  texts   Bocij,  2004;  Finn, 2004 .  People  may  also  use  CMCs  to  post  embarrassing  video,  images,  and  text  about another  person  for  the  public  to  see.  In  fact,  technology  has  greatly  increased  the likelihood of emotional or psychological harm resulting from these messages  Finkelhor et al., 2000; Wolak et al., 2004 .  Political and social movements also use CMCs in order to spread information about their causes or beliefs, as well as to engage in attacks against different targets online and offline   Brenner,  2008;  Cere,  2003;  Denning,  2011 .  For  instance,  riots  in  England  and Arab states across the Middle East have organized through the use of social media, such as  Twitter  and  Facebook   Stepanova,  2011 .  In  fact,  CMCs  may  be  used  to  form  flash mobs,  or  mass  organizations  of  people,  to  organize  quickly  and  move  rapidly  through the use of online media without alerting local citizens or law enforcement  Taylor et al., 2010 .  Various  extremist  groups  with  their  own  subcultural  norms  and  values  use  the Internet in order to promote their beliefs and connect interested parties  see Chapter 10 for  details .  Social  media  sites  like  Facebook,  video-sharing  sites  like  YouTube,  and various  web  forums  are  used  by  extremist  groups  to  promote  their  ideological  beliefs  Hegghammer,  2013;  Holt,  2012;  Weimann,  2011 .  For  instance,  Dylann  Roof  shot  and killed nine African Americans in a church in Charleston, South Carolina on June 17, 2015  Hankes, 2015 . His attack was racially motivated, and it was discovered shortly after his arrest  that  he  operated  a  website  where  he  posted  pictures  of  himself  with  guns, Confederate  flags,  and  neo-Nazi  and  white  supremacist  paraphernalia,  along  with  a manifesto explaining his views. He also posted on a white supremacist web forum called The Daily Stormer and used it as a vehicle to express his racist beliefs  Hankes, 2015 .  In  addition,  extremist  groups  have  used  the  Internet  in  order  to  engage  in  attacks against governmental targets worldwide. The hacker group Anonymous has engaged in a  variety  of  distributed  denial-of-service   DDoS   attacks  against  governments,  the recording  industry,  and  private  businesses   Correll,  2010;  Poulsen,  2011 .  In  a  DDoS attack,  individuals  send  multiple  requests  to  servers  that  house  online  content  to  the point where these servers become overloaded and are unable to be used by others. As a consequence, these attacks can completely knock a service offline, causing companies to lose  money  and,  potentially,  customer  confidence.  The  group  Anonymous  uses  these  41   attacks as a protest against attempts to reduce the distribution of pirated media online. Anonymous believes intellectual property laws are unfair, that governments are stifling the  activities  of  consumers,  so  the  group  wishes  to  elicit  a  direct  response  from  the general public to stand up against this supposed tyranny  Correll, 2010; Poulsen, 2011 . Thus,  the  use  of  technology  has  expanded  the  capability  of  extremist  groups  to  affect populations and targets well beyond their overall capacity in the real world.  42   This text  Given the range of criminal and deviant acts that are enabled by the Internet and CMCs, it is critical that we understand as much about these phenomena as possible. Thus, this book  will  explore  the  spectrum  of  cybercrimes  in  detail,  considering  how  real-world crimes have incorporated technology, as well as the unique forms of offending that have emerged  as  a  direct  result  of  technology.  In  addition,  each  chapter  will  consider  the unique  subcultures  that  have  emerged  in  online  environments  around  a  form  of deviance,  crime,  or  a  specific  ideology.  The  subcultural  norms  of  each  group  will  be explored  in  order  to  understand  how  involvement  in  this  subculture  affects  behavior both online and offline, as well as its influence on attitudes toward crime and deviance. Finally, statutes in the USA and abroad that have been created to address these issues will be covered, along with the local, state, national, and international law enforcement agencies that have responsibilities to investigate and enforce those laws.  Chapter  2,  “Law  enforcement,  privacy,  and  security  in  dealing  with  cybercrime,” provides  an  overview  of  the  various  entities  involved  in  policing  cyber-crimes.  This includes  traditional  local,  state,  and  federal  law  enforcement,  as  well  as  organizations and  industry  bodies  that  actively  attempt  to  mitigate  cyber-crimes  without  a  legal mandate from the state.  Chapter  3,  “Computer  hackers  and  hacking,”  explores  computer  hacking  in  depth, including  its  role  in  attacks  against  individuals  and  corporations  alike.  Chapter  4, “Malware and automated computer attacks,” explores the problem of malicious software and its evolution over time. Chapter 5,  “Digital  piracy  and  intellectual  property  theft,” considers the issue of digital piracy, including the theft and release of software, music, movies, television, and other digital content. More serious forms of fraud and theft are explored in Chapter 6, “Economic crimes and online fraud,” including the use of email scams in order to acquire financial information from unsuspecting victims.  Chapter  7,  “Pornography,  prostitution,  and  sex  crimes,”  covers  a  wide  variety  of online sexual behavior, including pornography, how the Internet has affected traditional prostitution,  and  how  the  criminal  justice  system  has  attempted  to  evolve  to  address these  issues.  Chapter  8,  “Child  pornography  and  sexual  exploitation,”  considers  sexual crimes  against  children,  including  child  pornography  and  child  molestation,  and  the ways  in  which  these  offenses  are  uniquely  engendered  by  technology.  Chapter  9, “Cyberbullying,  online  harassment,  and  cyberstalking,”  investigates  the  problem  of online  harassment,  bullying,  and  stalking,  while  Chapter  10,  “Online  extremism, cyberterror,  and  cyber  warfare,”  explores  the  use  of  technology  to  spread  hate  speech and extremism across the globe.  Chapter 11, “Cybercrime and criminological theories,” will provide the reader with an in-depth  examination  of  whether  traditional  criminological  theories  can  help  us  43   understand  why  individuals  commit  the  wide  range  of  behaviors  encompassed  in cybercrime. It will also explore the idea of whether new cybercrime theories are needed or whether our current stock of criminological theories is adequate in explaining these “new” forms of crime.  Chapter  12,  “Evolution  of  digital  forensics,”  will  elaborate  the  concept  of  digital forensics  and  the  process  of  seizing  evidence  from  various  devices.  Chapter  13, “Acquisition and examination of forensic evidence,” details the various tools used in the process  of  evidence  analysis,  as  well  as  the  techniques  involved  in  data  recovery  and investigation generally. Chapter 14, “Legal challenges in digital forensic investigations,” focuses on the process of evidence presentation in court, and the laws that affect what is admissible  and  when  by  an  analyst.  Finally,  Chapter  15,  “The  future  of  cybercrime, terror, and policy,” considers the future of cybercrime with a discussion of the ways in which  the  global  nature  of  technology  hinders  our  ability  to  effectively  regulate  these offenses.

Think  carefully  about  your  current  access  to  technology.  How  many laptops,  desktops,  tablets,  and  mobile  devices  do  you  own?  How  much time  do  you  spend  online?  How  would  you  compare  your  use  of technology to your peers’?  2.  Take a few moments to think critically about the way in which you share information  with  the  world  through  online  environments.  Do  you cautiously  share  personal  information?  How  much  detail  do  you  place about yourself into Facebook and other social networking sites? Do you use  the  same  credit  card  for  all  online  purchases?  How  often  do  you pirate music and media? Keeping this in mind, detail the various ways in which you could become a victim of as many forms of cybercrime as is possible.  3.  Do  you  belong  to  any  subcultures,  either  online  or  offline?  What  are they,  and  how  do  you  think  they  affect  your  activities  and  attitudes toward the world around you?  4.  How  much  overlap  do  you  see  between  real-world  crimes  and  cyber- crimes? Should we have distinct terms to recognize crime or deviance in online  environments,  or  should  all  offenses  just  be  classified  as  crimes, regardless of where and how they occur?  45   References  Associated Press.  2005 .

As a result, individuals who are victims may not know what agency to contact to report their experience. Most nations socialize citizens to contact their local emergency service provider in the event of crime, as with 911 in the USA or 999 in the UK. The average person may assume that their local police  agency  is  the  appropriate  point  of  contact  in  the  event  that  they  experience cybercrime victimization, though this is unlikely to result in a successful interaction for either the person or the agency.  Policing and law enforcement agencies are complex bureaucracies with roles that are bound by jurisdiction. For instance, if a person is the victim of identity fraud or theft in which  an  offender  living  in  another  state  or  country  uses  their  information  to  make online purchases, the limited jurisdiction of a local agency would mean that they cannot actually respond to the call for service  Walker and Katz, 2012 . Instead, it would likely have to be reported to a federal or national law enforcement agency, and even then it may  not  be  resolved  in  a  satisfactory  way  for  the  victim  due  to  the  difficulties  in transnational investigations.  Alternatively, the type of victimization an individual experiences may not be viewed as an incident that law enforcement can actually investigate. For instance, if an average home computer user’s machine is infected by a piece of malicious software, a local law enforcement agency may say that this is not a crime they can investigate. If there is no evidence that their personal information was compromised or misused by the attacker, then the incident may not technically constitute a violation of local laws  see Chapter 4 for  more  details  on  state  malware  laws .  Similarly,  receiving  a  single  malicious  or harassing  message  on  Facebook  or  Twitter  may  not  be  sufficient  to  justify  a  criminal complaint to a police agency  see Chapter 9 for more information .  These conditions may have consequences for the criminal justice system, as citizens may  become  less  willing  to  contact  police  or  report  their  experiences  with  cybercrime victimization, even if it is a serious offense  e.g. Cross, 2015; Furnell, 2002; Stambaugh et al., 2001 . If underreporting becomes a normalized behavior, then we may never know the extent to which individuals are victimized or understand the extent of the problem of cybercrimes.  Such  a  concern  is  real,  and  has  been  an  acknowledged  problem  by  law enforcement  policy  makers  and  researchers  since  the  mid-1990s   e.g.  Goodman,  1997; Stambaugh et al.,  2001 .  Despite  this  recognition,  police  agencies  have  been  relatively slow  to  respond  or  adapt  to  the  issue  of  cybercrime,  especially  local  agencies.  In  fact, empirical research on the police response to cybercrime is scant, with little measurement of officer opinions and attitudes  see Holt, Burruss, and Bossler, 2015 .  This  chapter  will  consider  why  police  agencies  have  had  issues  responding  to  54   cybercrime at all levels. We will provide an overview of the local, state, and federal or national  agencies  that  investigate  cybercrimes  as  well  as  attacks  by  nation-states  and terror threats. The increasingly common role of civil law in digital forensic examination and responses to technology misuse by corporations is also considered. We conclude the chapter  by  considering  the  growth  of  intelligence  agencies’  use  of  data  mining  online behavior  as  a  mechanism  to  ensure  national  security,  and  the  challenge  this  poses  to personal privacy.  55   Local police and sheriffs' offices  Just as with traditional forms of crime, most individuals may think that the first entity to contact in helping with a cybercrime is their local law enforcement agency. Local law enforcement  is  responsible  for  responding  to  a  wide  variety  of  calls,  helping  citizens, investigating crimes, arresting offenders, preventing crime, increasing public feelings of safety, and generally responding to a wide range of citizen requests within their limited jurisdiction. There is, however, a substantial degree of variation in the size and response capabilities of local law enforcement.  In  the  USA,  the  majority  of  law  enforcement  agencies  involve  local  police  forces serving a city, while sheriffs primarily handle entire counties  Walker and Katz, 2012 . Sheriff Offices differ from police in that they handle citizen calls for service in primarily rural areas such as unincorporated areas that are not part of a larger city. Sheriff Offices also maintain jails, provide court security, and may enforce civil laws such as evictions or the seizure of property depending on the state  Walker and Katz, 2012 .  Whether  an  agency  is  a  police  department  or  sheriff’s  office,  many  serve  small populations in rural or suburban communities with populations under 50,000  LEMAS, 2010 .  As  of  2013,  48  percent  of  all  local  agencies  employed  fewer  than  ten  sworn officers; 71 percent of these agencies served fewer than 10,000 citizens in total  Reaves, 2015 .  In  the  UK,  territorial  police  forces  are  responsible  for  policing  a  specific jurisdictional region and comprise the majority of police agencies generally  Yar, 2013 . In Canada, major urban centers, such as Toronto or Montreal, also have their own police forces which serve the local population.  Local  law  enforcement  agencies  in  most  countries,  including  the  USA,  do  not currently play a large role in preventing and investigating many forms of cybercrimes. They are responsible, however, for investigating crimes in which a victim and offender reside  within  their  jurisdiction.  For  example,  local  law  enforcement  is  primarily responsible for investigating most cases of online harassment or stalking  see Chapter 9 . Person-based cybercrime cases such as the creation and consumption of child porn  see Chapter 8; also Jenkins, 2001 , as well as sexual solicitation and prostitution cases in the USA, may also be investigated by local police agencies  see Chapter 7; also Cunningham and Kendall, 2010 .  Over the past three decades, both scholars and police administrators have created lists of  reasons  why  cybercrime  poses  significant  challenges  for  local  law  enforcement  and why  they  are  not  more  heavily  involved   Burns,  Whitworth,  and  Thompson,  2004; Goodman, 1997; Holt, Bossler, and Fitzgerald, 2010; Senjo, 2004; Stambaugh et al., 2001 . As  one  can  see  from  the  following  list,  some  of  the  challenges  may  be  addressed  by placing  more  priority   i.e.  funding   on  these  offenses.  Others  are  not  so  easily addressable. The list includes but is not limited to:  56      jurisdictional  issues  caused  by  the  victim  and  offender  not  living  in  the  same  municipality or county;    lack of a standard definition for cybercrime;   little public outcry in comparison to traditional crime, particularly violent crime;   difficulty in investigating an invisible crime;   difficulty in acquiring and maintaining the technologies required to investigate  these resources  see Chapters 12–14 ;    difficulty in training, retraining, and retaining trained officers;   lack of managerial and police support for the investigation of cybercrimes.  Although the above list of reasons why local law enforcement has been challenged by cybercrime  appears  to  be  insurmountable  to  some,  scholars  and  police  administrators have  still  argued  that  local  law  enforcement  must  play  a  larger  role  in  investigating cybercrimes  e.g. Bossler and Holt, 2012; Goodman, 1997; Stambaugh et al., 2001 . Some have argued for the development of more local cybercrime investigation units that could directly respond to crimes involving digital evidence in order to decrease assistance from state  and  national federal  levels   Hinduja,  2007;  Marcum,  Higgins,  Freiburger,  and Ricketts, 2010 . A recent longitudinal analysis of law enforcement data within the USA demonstrates  that  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the  number  of  specialized  cybercrime units at the local level  Willits and Nowacki, 2016 . They are, however, more likely to appear  in  police  agencies  that  serve  a  very  large  population,  such  as  major  cities  and urban  centers,  have  greater  patrol  duties,  and  possess  greater  general  access  to technology  Willits and Nowacki, 2016 .  For  more  information  on  the  challenges  cybercrimes  pose  to  local  law enforcement, go online to: www.ncjrs.gov pdffiles1 nij 186276.pdf.  Other scholars and commentators have focused on the need for improvement of patrol officers’ actions in acting as first responders to crime scenes with computers or digital evidence   Holt et al.,  2010;  National  Institute  of  Justice,  2008;  Stambaugh  et al.,  2001 . Almost no data exists on how often patrol officers actually respond to cybercrime calls, although  it  seems  quite  rare   Bossler  and  Holt,  2012;  Holt  et  al.,  2010 .  Nevertheless, government documents and training manuals indicate that government officials expect this not to be the case in the future. For example, in the USA, the National Institute of  57   For more information on ways that local agencies may move forward to better respond  to: www.policeforum.org assets docs Critical_Issues_Series_2 the%20role%20of%20local%20law%20enforcement%20agencies%20in%20preventing%20and%20investigating%20cybercrime%202014.pdf  cybercrime,   online   go   to   Justice   NIJ   published  the  second  edition  of  Electronic  Crime  Scene  Investigations:  A Guide for First Responders in 2008. This guide was created primarily for patrol officers and provided both basic and more advanced information on how to properly respond to a digital crime scene, including how to recognize, seize, document, handle, package, and even transport digital evidence. In addition, scholars and police administrators similarly argue for more computer training for patrol officers, since patrol officers in the USA are ill  prepared  to  respond  to  digital  evidence  scenes   Hinduja,  2007;  Holt  et  al.,  2010; Stambaugh et al., 2001 . It would seem to be a necessity that patrol officers have minimal computer  literacy  in  order  to  know  what  to  secure  and  to  understand  the  lexicon  of witnesses.  Interestingly, it appears that police officers themselves do not view their future role in dealing  with  cybercrime  the  same  way  as  scholars  and  police  administrators.  Patrol officers know that local law enforcement agencies generally place low priority on most forms  of  cybercrime  unless  it  is  child  pornography  related   Hinduja,  2004;  Holt  and Bossler, 2012; Senjo, 2004; Stambaugh et al., 2001 . Local agencies may also be increasing their capabilities to investigate various forms of online economic crimes, but they barely focus on computer intrusion offenses  see Box 2.1; also Holt et al., 2010 . In addition, they feel that police management, and prosecutors for that matter, have little knowledge of cybercrime  and  do  not  have  the  appropriate  resources  to  adequately  investigate  and prosecute most forms of cybercrime  Burns et al., 2004; Holt et al.,  2010;  Stambaugh et al., 2001 . They therefore do not believe that local law enforcement should be primarily responsible for dealing with cybercrime  Bossler and Holt, 2012; Burns et al., 2004 . They place  less  emphasis  than  police  administrators  on  the  importance  of  creating  local cybercrime investigative units and implementing additional computer training  Bossler and Holt, 2012 . Instead, they believe that the best strategies for dealing with cybercrime would be for citizens to be more careful online and for changes to the legal system. It would seem that they would not prefer any substantial changes to their roles of dealing primarily with traditional forms of crime and order maintenance.  58   Box 2.1 A local agency's new cybercrime detective  Leland cyber-crime detective fights fraud  www.starnewsonline.com news 20170129 leland-cyber-crime-detective-fights-fraud  “It has caused cases on our end to be able to be investigated quicker because we don’t have to wait for that information  to  come  back  and  we  don’t  have  to  wait  in  line  behind  all  the  other  agencies  that  have submitted  equipment,”  he  said.  “We  have  been  fortunate  to  have  someone  here  to  do  what  our  cyber crimes detective can do.”  This  article  details  the  hiring  of  the  first  full-time  cybercrime  detective  on  the Leland,  North  Carolina  Police  Department  in  2017.  The  story  provides  a  good example  of  how  a  local  police  department  establishing  a  dedicated  individual  to investigate  cybercrime  cases  and  handle  digital  evidence  can  make  a  dramatic difference for the community.  59   State agencies  The  next  level  of  law  enforcement  that  currently  has  any  substantial  responsibility  in addressing  cybercrime  is  state   e.g.  the  USA,  Australia   and  provincial   e.g.  Canada  police  agencies   Walker  and  Katz,  2012 .  In  the  USA,  state  agencies  can  focus  on highway traffic control, state law enforcement, or provide laboratory services to smaller agencies  depending  on  the  state’s  constitution  and  the  mission  of  the  state  agency.  In general,  many  states  have  a  state  law  enforcement  agency  that  can  investigate  crimes where a jurisdictional conflict exists or limited resources prevent a smaller agency from investigating the crime adequately  Walker and Katz, 2012 .  They  may  also  simply  provide  forensic  laboratory  needs,  including  digital,  for  state and local agencies. In many cases, the procedures and resources discussed in Chapters 12 to 14 of this volume are not available to local law enforcement and instead are conducted by  state  and  federal  labs.  As  noted  on  p.  43,  evidence  suggests  that  the  number  of specialized  cybercrime  units  has  grown  over  the  past  two  decades,  particularly  at  the state  level   Willits  and  Nowacki,  2016 .  This  may  be  due  to  the  enhanced  budgets available  to  state  agencies,  and  their  role  in  supporting  municipal  and  rural  area  law enforcement   Holt  et  al.,  2015;  Willits  and  Nowacki,  2016 .  Thus,  state  agencies  and resources are crucial in investigating cybercrimes that do not cross state boundaries.  In addition to specialized cybercrime units, state agencies in the USA have developed their  own  intelligence  sources,  called  fusion centers,  to  communicate  and  investigate threat  information  to  both  local  and  federal  agencies   Chermak  et  al.,  2013;  Coburn, 2015 .  The  concept  of  fusion  centers  was  developed  in  2003  as  a  collaborative  effort between  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  the  Office  of  Justice  Programs  to improve  communication  of  intelligence  information  in  the  wake  of  the  9 11  terror attacks  Coburn, 2015 . Fusion centers develop information and process leads that may be  of  value  for  law  enforcement  at  the  local,  state,  or  federal  level.  Initially,  centers focused on intelligence gathering on terror threats but many now develop information on  various  crimes,  including  cyber-threats.  Their  utility  in  developing  credible intelligence,  however,  has  been  substantially  criticized  regarding  both  terror  threats  Coburn, 2015  and cyber-threats  see Box 2.2 for details; also Zetter, 2012 .  Box 2.2 Assessing the credibility of a fusion center's  analysis of a cyber-attack  DHS issued false "water pump hack" report; called it a "success"  www.wired.com 2012 10 dhs-false-water-pump-hack .  60   But while DHS was busy pointing a finger at the fusion center, its own Office of Intelligence and Analysis had  been  irresponsibly  spreading  the  same  false  information  privately  in  a  report  to  Congress  and  the intelligence community.  This excellent report by Kim Zetter details the story of an Illinois fusion center that wrote  up  a  detailed  report  suggesting  that  a  failed  water  pump  in  a  local  water district’s SCADA system in 2011 was the result of Russian hackers. The initial report was  invalidated  by  subsequent  investigation  of  data  by  both  DHS  and  the  FBI, revealing  that  an  Illinois  contract  employee  logged  into  the  system  while  on vacation in Russia. The impact of poor reporting, however, was viewed as a success by DHS because it focused attention on the work of fusion centers generally. Thus, this  story  reveals  the  potential  challenges  that  may  result  from  the  work  of  state fusion centers.  61   Federal law enforcement  The highest levels of law enforcement in the USA and Australia operate at the national level. They are often the entities that are most frequently engaged in the investigation of cybercrimes due to the transnational nature of these offenses. In many cases, the victim and offender may live in different states or even in different countries. In addition, many types of cybercrime are relatively complex and require highly technical investigations. Nations have generally provided more resources for federal or national law enforcement agencies  to  investigate  these  offenses  rather  than  state  or  local  agencies   Walker  and Katz,  2012 .  Federal  agencies  may  also  play  a  major  role  in  addressing  crimes  or managing catastrophic incidents which require cooperation among many agencies across several jurisdictions affecting large populations.  The first federal law enforcement agency in the USA was the Coast Guard, which began  in  1790  in  order  to  prevent  smuggling  and  to  properly  collect  import  taxes  and duties  from  incoming  ships   Bowling  and  Sheptycki,  2012 .  Over  time,  additional agencies  were  added  due  to  the  expansion  of  the  nation  and  changes  in  the responsibilities  of  the  government.  Students  will  read  in  upcoming  chapters  about  the prominent  roles  that  federal  or  national  law  enforcement  agencies  have  when  dealing with a wide variety of cybercrime. Many of these agencies serve multiple roles ranging from the prevention, investigation, and apprehension of cyber-offenders to intelligence gathering  and  sharing.  Readers  of  this  volume  will  discover  the  Federal  Bureau  of Investigation’s   FBI   role  in  investigating  computer  intrusion   Chapter  3 ,  piracy  and intellectual theft  Chapter 5 , economic crimes  Chapter 6 , child pornography  Chapter 8 ,  serious  forms  of  stalking  that  cross  state  boundaries   Chapter  9 ,  and  cyberterror  Chapter 10 .  Readers  will  also  see  that  there  is  considerable  jurisdictional  overlap  at  the  federal level,  considering  that  several  agencies  are  responsible  for  investigating  the  same categories of cybercrime. For example, the United States Secret Service also investigates computer  intrusions  affecting  financial  institutions   Chapter  3   and  economic  crimes  Chapter 6 . U.S. Customs and Border Protection  CBP  may play a role in investigations of intellectual theft  Chapter 5  and economic crimes  Chapter 6 , while Immigration and Customs  Enforcement   ICE   may  also  be  involved  with  intellectual  theft   Chapter  5 , economic crime  Chapter 6 , and child pornography  Chapter 8  cases.  The highest levels of law enforcement in nations such as Canada, South Korea, and the UK are national police forces, though they serve the same function as federal law enforcement  in  the  USA.  The  UK  operates  “special  police  forces”  that  serve  across multiple  jurisdictions,  such  as  the  National  Domestic  Extremism  and  Disorder Intelligence Unit which responds to incidents of extremist activity within the UK, and the  National  Crime  Agency   NCA   which  contains  multiple  commands,  including  62   Border Policing and the National Cyber Crime Unit  National Crime Agency, 2017 . In Canada,  the  Royal  Canadian  Mounted  Police   RCMP   serves  as  the  national  police force and also patrols seven of the ten provinces and three territories within the nation. The RCMP operates in a similar fashion to the US FBI or Australian Federal Police and is responsible for the investigation of both traditional crime and cybercrimes  Bowling and Sheptycki, 2012 .  When problems escalate to the level of national safety, non-law enforcement agencies may  become  involved  in  addition  to  the  above-mentioned  agencies   Andress  and Winterfeld, 2013 . For example, the Department of Defense’s US Cyber Command and the  National  Security  Agency   NSA   are  involved  in  any  investigation  that compromises a military computer network or system, as well as cases of cyberterror and warfare.  The  Ministry  of  Defense  and  Government  Communications  Headquarters  GCHQ  plays a similar role in the UK, as does the Cyber Security Agency  CSA   in Singapore  and  the  Communications  Security  Establishment   CSE   in  Canada.  Thus, there is some separation of investigative responsibilities, depending on the target of an attack.  63   Civil investigation and application of digital evidence  Everything  discussed  thus  far  in  the  chapter  involves  violations  of  criminal  law  and statute,  though  this  is  not  the  only  mechanism  available  to  deal  with  cyber-crimes.  In most nations, there is both criminal law and civil law.  Criminal  cases  pursue  charges against an individual on behalf of the state and the victim, and recognize that a person has violated rules governing our behavior expressive of moral guidelines for action that protect others in society from harm  Kerley, Walter, and Banker Hames, 2011 . Civil law involves  disputes  between  private  parties,  individuals,  groups,  and organizations,  that  entail  a  violation  of  laws  regarding  private  rights  and  protections rather than morality.  including   In  a  civil  case,  a  party  can  file  a  suit  against  another  on  the  basis  of  a  contractual violation or injury. The entity who files the suit is referred to as the plaintiff, while the person being sued is the defendant  Kerley et al., 2011 . Civil cases focus primarily on monetary compensation to the plaintiff which may be to replace losses suffered, called compensatory  damages.  A  plaintiff  may  also  seek  punitive  damages,  or  money  as  a means  to  punish  the  defendant  for  wrongful  actions  due  to  negligence,  deceptive practices, or malicious activity  Kerley et al, 2011 .  Civil  suits  are  largely  handled  via  out-of-court  settlements  negotiated  between attorneys  representing  each  party  in  order  to  settle  the  dispute.  Such  processes  are thought to be more efficient and less public than a court appearance as the proceedings are private, and final settlements may not be disclosed to the general public. If the parties cannot  reach  an  agreement,  then  the  plaintiff  and  defendant  must  go  to  court  for  the case to be heard by a judge and or a jury depending on the jurisdiction. The outcome of the  court  proceeding  is  meant  to  determine  if  the  defendant  is  or  is  not  liable  for  the claims made by the plaintiff. If they are found liable, then the court can move to award the plaintiff with whatever damages were deemed appropriate  Kerley et al., 2011 .  It is important to note that, unlike criminal cases, the burden of proof in civil law is on a  preponderance  of  evidence.  Specifically,  the  plaintiff  must  present  evidence  that supports more than half of their claims regarding the defendant  Kerley et al., 2011 . In criminal  cases,  the  state  must  prove  their  claims  with  evidence  that  demonstrates  the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The lower burden in civil cases means that  it  may  be  more  efficient  to  pursue  such  cases  in  court.  However,  the  expense involved  may  limit  the  ability  of  individuals  or  small  businesses  to  pursue  civil  cases compared to large organizations or wealthy individuals. In addition, being found liable for  claims  in  a  civil  suit  does  not  infer  guilt  on  the  part  of  the  defendant,  nor  does  it require  admission  of  criminal  conduct.  As  such,  these  cases  frequently  wind  up  being pursued for restitution rather than achieving justice for a victim or injured party  Kerley et al., 2011 .  64   There are various circumstances where civil cases may be pursued, such as individuals getting a divorce, individuals suing a company due to injury, a business suing a person over  issues  associated  with  either  a  breach  of  contract  or  criminal  activity,  or corporations  suing  one  another  over  contractual  violations   Barbara,  2009 .  Evidence generated  from  digital  forensic  investigations  can  play  a  pivotal  role  in  support  of  a plaintiff’s  claims.  For  instance,  a  spouse  may  be  able  to  use  digital  evidence  to demonstrate  that  their  significant  other  engaged  in  an  extramarital  affair,  including emails, text messages, and images  see Box 2.3 for more details . An employer may also use  evidence  culled  from  an  employee’s  computer  to  demonstrate  that  the  employee violated the company’s fair-use policies for online behavior on the job. This may include web browser histories, email, various system files, executable programs, and other data.  Box 2.3 The role of digital evidence in divorce cases  Digital evidence outmodes physical evidence in divorce cases  www.ctlawtribune.com id=1202772209450 Digital-Evidence-Outmodes-Physical- Evidence-in-Divorce-Cases?mcode=0&curindex=0.  [M]any litigants are also surprised – and alarmed – to learn that the deletion of emails does not actually destroy them, and that they can often be recovered by forensic experts if given access to the computer or other electronic device in which they were generated.  This  article  provides  an  overview  of  the  increasingly  common  role  of  digital evidence in support of divorce cases, some of which may be brought by a spouse to an attorney without the need for traditional private investigative  PI  services. The author goes on to demonstrate why and how the private investigator plays a role in digital evidence handling and the extent to which the role of PIs is expanding with the growth of social media and data.  The process of digital forensic investigations in support of a civil suit is the same as those  used  by  law  enforcement  for  criminal  cases   see  Chapters  12  to  14 .  Law enforcement  agencies,  however,  do  not  conduct  investigations  in  civil  cases;  they  are performed  by  forensic  examiners  who  work  in  private  practice,  either  for  business  or independently  as private investigators  or private detectives.  An  individual  who  is  a  65   private  investigator  may  operate  on  their  own,  through  a  company,  or  through attorneys’  offices  to  support  either  criminal  or  civil  cases   Lonardo,  Rea,  and  White, 2015 .  Private  investigators  may  be  found  in  many  countries,  though  the  rules  governing their conduct and relationship to law enforcement and the government vary from place to  place.  Within  the  USA,  many  states  require  an  individual  to  be  registered  with,  or licensed  by,  the  state  in  order  to  operate   Lonardo  et  al.,  2015 .  Since  each  state  can dictate  the  conditions  needed  in  order  to  serve  as  an  investigator,  there  is  substantial variation in the experience and skills an individual must have in order to be licensed.  Interestingly, 30 states in the USA have laws requiring that an individual who is not in law enforcement but engages in digital forensic investigations for civil or criminal case support must be a licensed private investigator  Lonardo et al., 2015 . Only four of these states, however, specify that there is a distinction between being a forensic examiner and a private investigator. Of the remaining states, 15 have no PI licensing requirements by either  statute  or  interpretation  of  existing  law,  while  five  states  have  no  licensing statutes related to private investigation whatsoever  Lonardo et al., 2015 .  For more information on the various state laws related to private investigators’ role  to: http:  ojs.jdfsl.org index.php jdfsl article view 294 241.  examiners,   forensic   online   go   as   There is some debate over the need for licensing digital forensic examiners within the field. Some argue that licensing is needed to ensure that a standard of professionalism can be implemented across the field and oversight provided by each state  Lonardo et al., 2015 . For instance, Florida’s statutes recognize that licensing provides a necessary check because “untrained persons, unlicensed persons or businesses, or persons who are not of good moral character [.] are a threat to the welfare of the public if placed in positions of trust.”  The  PI  license,  however,  does  nothing  to  necessarily  ensure  the  competency  of  a forensic  investigator.  Instead,  the  certifications  which  an  individual  receives  from various  accrediting  bodies  ensure  that  an  individual  is  fully  trained  in  the  proper handling, processing, and reporting of evidence  Barbara, 2009 . In fact, a recent survey of  100  forensic  examiners  found  that  a  proportion  of  respondents  were  private investigators  with  no  actual  certifications  in  digital  forensics  or  were  active  duty  law  66   enforcement  officers  using  their  organization’s  equipment  to  perform  investigations  Kessler International, 2017 . As a result, care must be taken when discussing the issue of private  investigators  and  their  credentials  to  actually  conduct  digital  forensic investigations.  Private  investigators  are  not  the  only  non-criminal  justice  system  actors  who  now play  a  role  in  civil  actions  against  cybercrime.  Various  corporations  and  organizations are increasingly taking steps to sanction cybercriminals or the infrastructure supporting their  activities  via  civil  suits.  For  instance,  the  Recording  Industry  Association  of America   RIAA   and  the  UK’s  Federation  Against  Copyright  Theft   FACT   work  in conjunction with ISPs to send cease-and-desist letters to individuals who are thought to have illegally downloaded media without payment through various online sources  see Chapter 5 for more details; also Nhan, 2013 . This is a relatively simple strategy that is legally  justified  on  the  basis  of  the  copyright  holders’  financial  interests  which  are harmed by people attempting to pirate their products. Sending out letters indicating that the person should not engage in further attempts to pirate media is thought to serve as a deterrent by demonstrating that an individual’s online activities are not anonymous, and may lead to further sanctions.  Similarly,  Microsoft  has  engaged  in  civil  actions  against  various  malware  operators, including  the  individual  creators  and  the  web-hosting  services  that  may  be  associated with operation of the tools. For example, the company filed a civil lawsuit against two men, Naser Al Mutairi from Kuwait and Mohamed Benabdellah from Algeria, in 2014. They  claimed  that  the  men  were  responsible  for  infecting  millions  of  computers  with keylogging software called Blababindi and Jenxcus  Athow, 2014 . The suit also named a Domain Name Service provider called No-IP for their role in facilitating the infections on the basis that it did not secure its infrastructure from compromise. Specifically, the DNS service  provider  makes  sure  that  a  specific  domain  name,  like  malwarehosting.net, always  goes  to  their  computer,  even  if  it  gets  a  different  IP  address  at  some  point  Athow,  2014 .  The  hackers  used  this  infrastructure  to  manage  infected  systems  and obtain data from them over time.  Through the suit’s claims, Microsoft was able to seize the domains hosted by No-IP in order  to  block  the  infected  computers  from  accessing  the  Internet,  rendering  them unusable to the attackers. This move led to over 1.8 million customers unaffected by the malware  to  lose  access  to  the  company’s  services.  No-IP  claimed  that  they  were  not contacted by Microsoft but were instead sued, making them unable to respond to what would have otherwise been an easily mitigated problem  Munson, 2014 . Eventually both companies settled out of court, but the criticisms of Microsoft’s activities have led some to  question  whether  such  efforts  are  appropriate  given  that  Microsoft  is  neither  a  law enforcement agency nor does it have a necessary duty or legal authority to protect the general  public.  In  addition,  Microsoft  was  able  to  identify  the  IP  addresses  of  private citizens,  which  may  constitute  a  violation  of  user  agreements  and  individual  privacy  Adhikari,  2013 .  Further  research  is  needed  to  understand  the  ethical  implications  of corporate civil strategies to combat cybercrime.  67   For more details on the potential legal and social risks posed by civil actions against  cybercriminals  by  companies  to: http:  digitalcommons.law.scu.edu cgi viewcontent.cgi?article=1592&context=chtlj.  like  Microsoft,  go  online   68   Extralegal agencies and non-governmental organizations  The scope of cybercrime is substantial, but it is clear that law enforcement agencies have limitations that make it difficult for them to respond sufficiently to these offenses. As a result,  there  are  a  range  of  public  and  private  entities  that  operate  outside  of  law enforcement  and  government  agencies  which  exist  to  respond  to  and  investigate cybercrimes. Such groups are typically referred to as non-governmental organizations  NGOs   because  they  have  no  legal  responsibility  to  enforce  the  law  or  respond  to criminal activity, though they may work in conjunction with law enforcement agencies to provide assistance or information  Wall, 2007 . NGOs who respond to cybercrimes are largely  gatekeepers  for  victims  or  consumers  and  facilitate  linkages  to  the  criminal justice system generally. We will provide three examples of NGOs here, though readers will note that NGOs are mentioned throughout each chapter of the book.  The Internet Crime Complaint Center  IC3   One of the prominent non-governmental agencies dealing with cybercrime in the USA is the Internet Crime Complaint Center  IC3 , which was created in 2000. The IC3 was established in 2000 as a publicly funded, joint operation of the FBI, the Bureau of Justice Assistance   BJA ,  and  the  National  White  Collar  Crime  Center   NWC3   to  provide  a reporting  mechanism  for  cybercrime  complaints   see  Chapter  6  for  more  details .  The IC3 serves as a coordinating agency for the FBI and local law enforcement to respond to various  forms  of  cybercrime,  with  a  specific  emphasis  on  economically  motivated offenses. In fact, the Center was originally called the Internet Fraud Complaint Center, though  it  was  changed  from  Fraud  to  Crime  in  2003  to  better  recognize  the  range  of offenses reported by victims  Internet Crime Complaint Center, 2017 .  The  primary  role  of  the  IC3  is  to  offer  cybercrime  victims  a  reporting  mechanism through an online complaint form. Respondents must complete questions concerning the incident, the offenders  if known , and the response from the victim, including when and who may have received information about the incident. Complaints are then processed by the IC3 staff, and forwarded to the appropriate local, state, or federal agency when necessary  Internet Crime Complaint Center, 2017 . The trends and statistics developed from reports are also published by the IC3 as an aggregated yearly report on cybercrime incidents.  Computer emergency response teams  CERTs   Although  the  IC3  operates  as  a  venue  for  cybercrime  reporting,  there  are  other  NGOs  69   operating which provide information about cybercrime threats. One of the largest groups of  NGOs  is  computer  emergency  response  teams   CERTs ,  which  may  be  publicly funded  and  operate  to  support  the  community,  or  run  by  private  industry  to  facilitate information  sharing   see  Chapter  4  for  more  details .  There  are  369  CERTs  operating around  the  globe,  located  in  universities,  government  agencies,  and  private  industry  FIRST, 2017 . Although CERTs play somewhat different roles depending on where they are  housed,  their  primary  functions  are  to  provide  information  on  emerging  hardware and software vulnerabilities, malware threats, and security tools to insulate systems from compromise. Some CERTs are also able to engage in incident response for government agencies,  organizations,  and  businesses  to  determine  how  an  attack  took  place   US- CERT, 2017 .  Working to Halt Online Abuse  WHOA   An additional form of NGOs operates via private citizens who have come together for a specific cause. A notable example of such an NGO is Working to Halt Online Abuse  WHOA , which is a volunteer-driven organization established in 1997 as a resource to assist individuals who experience harassment or stalking  see Chapter 9 for more details; WHOA, 2015 . WHOA takes reports of cyberstalking directly from victims, and employs advocates  who  live  in  countries  around  the  world  to  aid  individuals   WHOA,  2015 . Since  WHOA  is  not  a  law  enforcement  agency,  it  cannot  bring  charges  against  a prospective  offender.  Instead,  when  a  victim  contacts  WHOA,  the  staff  of  volunteer Internet Safety Advocates assist the victim in maintaining evidence of their experiences, and  assist  in  contacting  law  enforcement  and  industrial  sources  such  as  ISPs   WHOA, 2015 .  70   International enforcement challenges  The scope of cybercrimes presents a substantial challenge to law enforcement agencies, particularly those operating at the federal or national level. Agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Secret Service in the USA have a remit to investigate both domestic  and  international  cybercrime   Andress  and  Winterfeld,  2013;  Brenner,  2008; Holt  and  Bossler,  2016 .  They  are  limited,  however,  by  existing  legislation  and cooperative  agreements  with  other  countries.  Although  virtually  all  industrialized nations have criminalized various forms of trespass and fraud, there is limited parity in the language of statutes  Brenner, 2011 .  The  problem  is  exacerbated  by  a  lack  of  extradition  agreements  between  the  USA, China, Russia, and the Ukraine. These conditions make the USA an attractive target for offenders living in these nations, making it difficult to deter actors on the basis of legal sanctions alone  Brenner, 2008 . In addition, federal prosecutors may choose not to take a case if the suspects reside in these nations, as there will be no real likelihood of arrest  Brenner, 2008; Holt and Bossler, 2016 . As a result, US law enforcement agencies have become reliant on existing extradition relationships with friendly nations in the hope of detaining cybercriminals in the event that they travel abroad  Holt and Bossler, 2016 .  One  key  avenue  to  improve  law  enforcement  agencies’  capacity  is  through  the expansion  of  the  existing  criminal  code  to  include  various  acts  not  currently criminalized, or to increase punishments for existing offenses  Brenner, 2008; Holt and Bossler,  2016 .  There  are  currently  federal  statutes  regarding  the  compromise  of computers, the use of malware to facilitate attacks, the acquisition or theft of personal information and the use of such information to engage in identity fraud  Brenner, 2011 . There is no language within these statutes relating to the sale of financial information if the  individual  does  not  actually  acquire  personal  information  on  their  own   Holt  and Bossler, 2016; Tucker, 2014 . In this respect, the range of markets set up to sell personal information  to  others  may  be  able  to  operate  while  in  a  legal  gray  area  because  the vendors  are  not  necessarily  in  violation  of  federal  statutes.  The  Department  of  Justice recently lobbied Congress in an attempt to close this gap through the creation or revision of  legislation  to  criminalize  the  sale,  purchase,  or  possession  of  credit  and  debit  card information issued from a US bank regardless of where the transactions were completed  Tucker,  2014 .  Thus,  there  are  clear  gaps  in  the  capacity  of  federal  law  enforcement agencies to respond to cyber-trespass, deception, and theft.  71   The tension between security and privacy  In a post-9 11 world, the need to identify actionable intelligence on threats has become paramount  for  virtually  all  nations.  Terrorist  groups  have  the  capacity  to  spread  their ideologies via social media and various websites, making susceptible individuals willing to  engage  in  acts  of  extreme  violence  against  people  either  in  their  home  city  or  in another  nation   see  Chapter  10  for  more  details;  also  Britz,  2010;  Denning,  2010 .  In addition,  governments  must  also  address  the  increasingly  common  threats  posed  by serious cyber-attacks by terrorists, nation-states, and criminals  Andress and Winterfeld, 2013; Rid, 2013 .  All of these threats have raised substantial concerns across the globe as how to best protect  people  and  infrastructure  from  harm.  Physical  barriers,  police,  and  intelligence agency staff play an important role in the protection of a nation, but there is also a need for  tools  and  infrastructure  to  proactively  develop  intelligence  on  threats,  and  the individuals  and  groups  planning  to  do  harm.  Prior  to  the  Internet,  law  enforcement agencies  could  reasonably  monitor  a  group  of  interest  to  national  security  via wiretapping,  or  covertly  listening  in  to  phone  conversation  and  other  methods  to surreptitiously  observe  and  capture  information  on  threats   Andress  and  Winterfeld, 2013 .  The  growth  of  social  media  and  online  communications  through  various applications such as Whatsapp, Periscope, and Yik-Yak have exponentially increased the ways in which offenders can connect and share information in clear text and encrypted methods.  As a result, many nations have increased their information collection mechanisms to gain  access  to  both  online  information  and  real  world  communications  to  identify threats in advance and to foil potential attacks. The nature of these methods is largely kept secret from the general public on the basis that knowledge of the processes could lead  them  to  be  defeated  by  savvy  actors   Rid,  2013 .  This  creates  a  challenge  for  free societies, as the public has a reasonable right to their personal privacy, or the ability to keep aspects of their lives secret from others  Rid, 2013 . Any attempt by the government to violate individual privacy should be made known to the public, as it could be against the  law.  This  creates  a  tension  between  individuals’  rights  to  privacy  and  the government’s need to protect the safety of the general public.  This was evident in the USA following a massive domestic terror incident, when Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik shot and killed 14 people and wounded another 22 during  a  holiday  party  at  the  San  Bernardino,  California  Department  of  Health  on December  2,  2015   Keneally  and  Shapiro,  2015 .  Both  Farook  and  Malik  fled  from  the scene of the shooting in an SUV, which was eventually located by police. Following a high-speed pursuit, the pair were killed in a shootout with police. Subsequent searches of their  home  led  police  to  discover  a  cache  of  weapons  and  homemade  explosives,  72   suggesting they had planned to engage in further attacks.  The FBI took charge of the investigation in the wake of the incident, which eventually became known as the San Bernardino Shooter Case. Agents came to realize that both Farook  and  Malik  were  motivated  by  radical  Islamic  beliefs  and  accessed  a  range  of online content produced by terrorist organizations overseas. Farook’s iPhone 5c, which was  owned  by  the  county,  was  also  recovered  by  agents.  The  FBI  stated  that  it  was unable  to  unlock  the  phone  and  decrypt  its  contents  for  investigators  because  of  the security  features  in  the  iOS  software.  The  USA  does  not  have  any  encryption  key disclosure laws to mandate individuals to give passwords or access information to law enforcement, making it difficult to compel suspects to provide access to their devices  see Chapter 14 for more details .  As a result, the federal magistrate hearing the case ordered Apple to provide resources to enable the FBI to access the phone’s contents. Apple refused on the basis that it would violate  the  Fifth  Amendment  rights  of  the  general  public,  as  whatever  protocols  were developed for this case could be used against any of their customers  Benner, Lichtblau, and Wingfield, 2016 . Eventually, the FBI revealed that they no longer needed Apple to intervene  as  they  were  able  to  pay  a  third  party  for  a  solution  to  decrypt  the  phone  Barrett, 2016 . This led to public outrage, as the FBI gave very little information as to how this solution was developed or what this means for individual privacy rights and the safety of their electronic information  see Chapter 14 for more discussion .  The difficulty maintaining the balance between safety and privacy was also evident in the  revelations  made  by  Edward  Snowden  regarding  the  information  collection processes of both the NSA and the GCHQ in the UK. Snowden was an NSA contractor who  publicly  disclosed  thousands  of  classified  documents  to  journalists  detailing  the existence  of  various  active  intelligence  programs  designed  to  mine  electronic communications  data  maintained  by  technology  companies  and  service  providers, including  Apple,  Facebook,  Google,  Microsoft,  Skype,  and  Verison   Gidda,  2013;  Rid, 2013 . One of the largest of these programs was called PRISM, which was set up in 2007 and  combined  machine-learning  techniques  with  massive  data  streams  of  email,  text, and other electronic communications data from at least nine major service providers to develop  intelligence  on  terror  threats   Gidda,  2013 .  The  data  collected  were indiscriminately  targeted,  meaning  anyone’s  information  may  have  been  included,  but ideally  could  only  be  queried  by  PRISM  analysts  as  a  means  to  identify  networks  of terrorists or threats. Evidence suggested, however, that the data could have been used by NSA  employees  with  minimal  legal  justification  to  search  for  private  information  Gidda,  2013 .  The  data  and  analyses  could  also  be  shared  with  the  USA’s  Five  Eyes partners: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK  Andress and Winterfeld, 2013 . This  news  outraged  many  other  nations,  as  their  citizens  may  have  been  unfairly affected by this program.  Snowden also revealed a program called KARMA POLICE  which  was  implemented by the UK’s GCHQ. The program was designed to create profiles of the Internet use of every  public  person  online  using  various  pieces  of  data  that  could  be  surreptitiously  73   collected  Gallagher, 2015 . It began in earnest in 2009 through the use of hardware taps installed  on  the  fiber-optic  cables  used  to  provide  transnational  Internet  connectivity. Approximately 25 percent of the world’s Internet traffic is routed through these cables in the UK, enabling GCHQ to capture sensitive data from global users as it passed through the wires without notification to the user  Gallagher, 2015 . Their taps capture specific details about individual Internet users through their web browser meta-data, including the  individual  IP  address  of  the  computer,  the  last  web  pages  visited  through  that browser,  the  time  stamp  for  pages  visited  compared  to  the  IP  address,  and  the  search queries used. Additional data were also eventually captured on individuals’ use of email, instant messaging systems, search engines, social media, as well as the use of proxies or other anonymity tools  Gallagher, 2015 .  The  massive  amount  of  information  collected  by  GCHQ  analysts  could  enable substantial  profiling  of  not  only  individual  computer  users  but  potentially  also  entire countries. The process of data collection enabled GCHQ to collect 50 billion meta-data records per day, capturing user behaviors worldwide. At the individual level, the meta- data captured from browsers could be used to track a person’s entire online footprint at any  time  of  day  and  collate  this  information  to  patterns  of  email  and  other  online communications platforms. In the aggregate, GCHQ argued that it had the potential to detect shifts in an entire country’s user behaviors and to identify suspicious patterns in web traffic that could indicate online or offline threats. They used this data to examine both foreign threats, as well as those within the UK which was supported through a legal loophole  that  allowed  investigators  to  profile  UK  citizens  without  notification  Gallagher, 2015 .  The emergence of information on KARMA POLICE through the Snowden leak led to an investigation of the processes of GCHQ by the UK Parliament. The study found that the program operated with minimal government oversight or court rulings to justify data collection. This led to a substantial overhaul of the laws concerning spy techniques and the need for mass data collection  Gallagher, 2015 .  This  program,  however,  has  not  attracted  the  same  global  attention  as  PRISM,  even though  it  had  much  broader  consequences  for  many  more  nations.  This  begs  the question as to why such programs have not produced greater outrage from citizens over governmental attempts to ensure public safety  see Box 2.4 for details . A proportion of the general population may feel that such concerns are trivial, as we must ensure public safety at any cost. Others recognize that when a nation’s security forces actively exceed the  rule  of  law,  or  intrude  on  their  citizens’  rights,  then  their  efforts  are  unlawful  Godwin, 2003; Yar, 2013 .  Box 2.4 An examination of why we should be concerned  by government spying campaigns  74   Nine reasons you should care about NSA's PRISM surveillance  http:  theconversation.com nine-reasons-you-should-care-about-nsas-prism- surveillance-15075.  Mass surveillance and data retention overturn the foundation of the modern legal system: the presumption of innocence. Not only is the presumption lost for gathering evidence, it also weakens the effect of that presumption throughout the rest of the legal process.  This article provides a clear and succinct explanation of the reasons why the average person  should  be  concerned  about  government-spying  programs  like  PRISM. Although  it  may  seem  like  a  problem  only  for  those  who  are  engaged  in  illicit behavior,  these  programs  effectively  erode  our  civil  rights  and  require  greater consideration.  Engaging  in  illegal  activity  or  behaviors  that  the  general  public  views  as  being illegitimate  can  erode  public  confidence  in  the  agencies  and  the  officials  who  demand they be performed. Should that occur, government agencies and officials run the risk of losing the trust, support, and cooperation of the general public, as well as the likelihood that  citizens  will  comply  with  laws   Sunshine  and  Tyler,  2003;  Tyler,  2004 .  Many Western nations are now in the midst of struggles over the perceived legitimacy of their governments  and  their  use  of  authority.  In  any  free  nation,  the  public  has  a  right  to question how the state uses its power, the extent to which that power can be checked by legislators or the judiciary, and how abuses of power can be identified and resolved. This is  a  delicate  balance  which  can  be  easily  upset  through  authoritarian  tendencies  or overzealous  demands  that  could  benefit  a  nation’s  enemies   Yar,  2013 .  As  a consequence,  we  must  keep  these  tensions  in  mind  when  considering  efforts  to  secure cyberspace.  75   Summary  The problem of cybercrime is complex, requiring a clear and coordinated response from police agencies and law enforcement. At present, the local, state, and federal levels each have their own role, but they differ in terms of their capacity to fully investigate civilian calls  for  service.  These  issues  are  exacerbated  at  the  international  level  due  to  the limitations  of  extradition  relationships  and  investigative  resources.  Corporations  and non-governmental  agencies  have  emerged  as  an  important  resource  to  combat  or investigate cybercrimes in the absence of a more robust law enforcement strategy. The strengths  and  weaknesses  of  all  of  these  entities   police,  NGOs,  and  industry   are discussed  in  subsequent  chapters  of  this  volume  to  demonstrate  the  ways  in  which cybercrimes are dealt with around the world.

How can police agencies improve their response to cybercrime, especially in light of the continuous evolution of technology and communications applications?  2.  If  federal  agencies  have  the  greatest  responsibility  to  investigate cybercrime  but  have  difficulties  arresting  offenders  due  to  limited extradition relationships, how can we improve their ability to deal with these offenses?  3.  What issues can you see in having corporations play a more prominent  role in combatting cybercrime through the use of civil lawsuits?  4.  How do we balance security and privacy? Should Edward Snowden be viewed as a traitor who diminished national security or a hero protecting individual rights of privacy?  77   References  Adhikari, R.  2013 .

DHS issued false “water pump hack” report; Called it a “success.” Wired, October 2. Available at: www.wired.com 2012 10 dhs-false-water-pump- hack .  81   Chapter  3 Computer Hackers and Hacking  Chapter goals    Define a “hack” and a “hacker.”    Identify  the  ways  in  which  both  people  and  technology  can  be  compromised by hackers.    Differentiate between nation-state and non-nation-state hackers.   Explain the key norms and values of the hacker subculture.   Identify the various terms used to define and differentiate hackers.   Consider the evolution of hacking in tandem with technology over the past  60 years.     Assess  the  legal  frameworks  used  to  prosecute  hackers  and  the  ability  of  law enforcement agencies to address computer hacking.  82   Introduction  Many  in  the  general  public  conceive  of  hackers  as  skilled  technological  wizards  who break  into  the  Department  of  Defense,  financial  institutions,  and  other  protected networks with the intent to do harm. The notion of a hacker may also conjure up images of various characters from television and movies, such as Neo from the Matrix Trilogy, who had the ability to “see” in programming language code and bend “virtual” reality. These  stories  and  representations  have  become  the  dominant  model  for  hackers  in popular  media  and  news  organizations.  Although  there  are  a  number  of  hackers  who engage  in  malicious  activities,  and  some  who  are  amazingly  sophisticated  technology users, they do not accurately represent the entire population of hackers. Instead, hackers also  operate  to  defend  computer  networks  and  expand  the  utility  of  technology.  In addition, an increasing proportion of the hacker community has a relatively low level of technological sophistication; only a small group has expert-level knowledge of computer hardware and software. The global hacker community is also driven by a wide range of motivations which leads them to engage in both legal and illegal hacks.  This chapter is designed to present the subculture of hackers in a realistic light devoid of the glitz and flash of what may be portrayed in films. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to understand the variations in the legal and ethical perspectives of hackers, as well as the norms and values of the hacker subculture. The history of hacking over the past  60  years  will  also  be  explored  to  ground  your  understanding  of  the  actions  of hackers  over  time,  including  the  ways  in  which  individual  motives  for  hacking  have changed with the explosion in computer technology. In turn, you will be able to consider the activities of hackers from their point of view rather than from stereotypes and media hype.  Finally,  we  will  explore  the  various  legal  frameworks  that  have  been  created  to address  illegal  computer  hacking  and  the  capabilities  of  law  enforcement  agencies  to actually make an impact.  83   Defining computer hacking  While  many  in  the  general  public  equate  computer  hacking  with  criminal  activity, hacking  is  actually  a  skill  that  may  be  applied  in  a  variety  of  ways  depending  on  the ethical perspective of the actor. A hack involves the modification of technology, such as the  alteration  of  computer  hardware  or  software,  in  order  to  allow  it  to  be  used  in innovative ways, whether for legitimate or illegitimate purposes  Holt, 2007; Levy, 2001; Schell and Dodge, 2002; Steinmetz, 2015; Turkle, 1984 . There are myriad applications of hacking for beneficial uses that are not in fact illegal. For instance, iPhones and iPods are designed to run only Apple-approved software and applications. Any “app,” ringtone, or wallpaper  design  that  the  company  has  deemed  unacceptable  due  to  risqué  or inappropriate content will not work on their devices  Kravets, 2010 . If a user wanted to use these resources, or even change the appearance of the icons and applications on their Apple  device,  they  would  have  to  find  a  way  to  work  around  these  limitations.  Thus, programmers  have  created  “jailbreaking”  programs  that  enable  users  to  install  third party designers’ programs to be used on an iPhone or other Apple product. The use of jailbreaking  programs  constitutes  a  hack,  as  they  enable  actors  to  use  their  devices  in ways that were not initially allowed by the designer. The use of these programs is not illegal, though they can void the product warranty, making the user accountable for their use of hacking programs  Kravets, 2010 .  Hacks that modify programs and subvert security protocols, however, are illegal and may  be  used  to  obtain  information  or  gain  access  to  computer  systems  and  protected resources in furtherance of illegal acts, ranging from stealing credit cards to acts of terror  Brenner,  2008;  Chu,  Holt,  and  Ahn,  2010;  Kilger,  2010;  see  Figure  3.1  for  details .  In many  cases,  hackers  use  very  basic  non-technical  strategies  rather  than  sophisticated attacks  to  obtain  information.  For  instance,  individuals  can  steal  someone’s  passwords for  email  accounts  or  access  to  a  system  by  looking  over  the  victim’s  shoulder  and watching  their  keystrokes.  This  act,  called  shoulder  surfing,  is  simple,  and  can  be performed by anyone in order to obtain sensitive information  Mitnick and Simon, 2002; Wall, 2007 . Similarly, hackers can employ social engineering  tactics  to  try  to  fool  or convince people to provide them with information that may be used to access different resources   Furnell,  2002;  Huang  and  Brockman,  2010;  Mitnick  and  Simon,  2002 .  These attacks often involve making simple requests and acting clueless in order to prey upon people’s  willingness  to  help  others   Mitnick  and  Simon,  2002 .  These  sorts  of  non- technical  attacks  are  invaluable  to  attackers  because  it  is  extremely  difficult  to  protect individuals  from  being  compromised,  unlike  computer  systems  and  physical  buildings  Huang and Brockman, 2010; Mitnick and Simon, 2002 . Often the most easily exploited vulnerability  for  a  person,  organization,  or  a  business  is  not  a  flaw  in  hardware  or software, but rather the individuals themselves. In fact, more than half of all investigated  84   data breaches in a sample of businesses and universities were completed through the use of techniques that required little or no skill  Verison, 2016 .

The  information  which  victims  provide  in  non-technical  attacks  frequently  includes usernames  and  passwords  for  different  resources  like  email.  In  turn,  the  attacker  can gain access to personal or corporate information sources that they may not own or have permission  to  access.  The  issue  of  ownership  and  access  is  why  David  Wall   2001  conceived of computer hacking as an act of cyber-trespass in keeping with burglary in the  real  world.  A  hacker  must  cross  network  boundaries  without  approval  from  the owner  or  operator  in  much  the  same  way  as  a  burglar  enters  a  dwelling  without permission.  In  order  to  compromise  a  computer  system  or  network,  the  hacker  must  85   utilize vulnerabilities, or flaws, in computer software or hardware, or people in the case of social engineering  Furnell, 2002; Taylor, 1999 . There are hundreds of vulnerabilities that have been identified in all manner of software, from the Microsoft operating system Windows, to the web browsers we use every day  Wang, 2006 . In much the same way that burglars in the real world attempt to identify weaknesses in the design of homes, entrances, exits, and residents’ behaviors and activities in order to find ways to get inside a location  e.g. Wright and Decker, 1994 , hackers’ first steps in developing a hack using technical means is identifying these vulnerabilities.  For more information on vulnerabilities, go online to: https:  nvd.nist.gov.  Once a vulnerability has been identified in a piece of technology, a hacker can then develop or use an exploit, a program that can take advantage of vulnerabilities to give the  attacker  deeper  access  to  a  system  or  network   Furnell,  2002;  Taylor,  1999;  Wang, 2006 .  There  are  many  tools  available  online  for  hackers  to  use  in  order  to  exploit existing vulnerabilities in computer software  Chu et al., 2010; Wang, 2006  and various forms  of  malicious  software  which  can  be  acquired  for  free  from  web  forums  or purchased from vendors in online black markets  see Chapter  4  for  details;  Chu et al., 2010 . Similarly, burglars can use tools, such as crowbars and keys, to gain access to a residence through vulnerable points of entry  Wright and Decker, 1994 .  In the context of hacking, vulnerabilities and their attendant exploits may be used by anyone regardless of their ethical beliefs. For instance, there are vulnerability scanning tools available online, such as Nessus, which allow individuals to easily determine all the vulnerabilities  present  on  a  computer  system   Wang,  2006 .  This  tool  may  be  used  by hackers working on “red teams” or “tiger teams” hired by corporations to identify and penetrate  their  networks  in  order  to  better  secure  their  resources.  Red  teams  are authorized by system owners to engage in these acts; thus they are not violating the law. The same scanner could be used as a first step in an attack to identify vulnerabilities on a system to determine what exploits should be used to compromise the system. Running such a scan without permission from the system owners would be viewed as an illegal form of hacking  Wall, 2001 .  86   Victims of hacking  Despite  misconceptions  about  who  and  what  is  a  hacker,  it  is  clear  that  the  use  of hacking for malicious purposes can have severe economic and social consequences for computer users. The most common targets for attack by malicious hackers are individual computer users, private industry, and governments  Brenner, 2008 . In fact, the general public  present  an  excellent  target  for  the  majority  of  hackers  since  they  may  have sensitive  information  stored  on  their  computers  and  can  serve  as  a  launch  point  for subsequent attacks against different targets  discussed in Chapter 4 .  A  malicious  hack can often affect multiple groups at the same time, and may be performed by individuals acting alone, in small groups, or in conjunction with a foreign military or government. When  individuals  act  without  any  sort  of  state  backing,  they  are  referred  to  as  non- nation-state-sponsored  actors  because  they  have  no  immediate  affiliation  to  an organization  Brenner, 2008; Denning, 2010 .  For  more  information  on  cyberthreats  at  the  nation-state  level,  go  online  to: www.baesystems.com en cybersecurity feature the-nationstate-actor.  Non-nation-state  actors  who  engage  in  hacking  frequently  target  individuals  and institutions  in  order  to  steal  sensitive  information  that  can  be  resold  or  used  in  some fashion for a profit  Franklin, Paxson, Perrig, and Savage, 2007; Holt and Lampke, 2010; Peretti,  2009 .  For  instance,  credit  and  debit  card  numbers  are  a  regular  target  for hackers, as this information can be used by the hacker to obtain funds or sold to others to  facilitate  fraud   Franklin  et al.,  2007;  Holt  and  Lampke,  2010;  Thomas  and  Martin, 2006 . These attacks negatively affect both the cardholders and the financial institutions who manage customer accounts  Peretti, 2009 .  One of the most extreme examples of this sort of compromise took place in January 2009  against  the  Heartland  Payment  Systems  company   Vijayan,  2010 .  This  company processed credit card transactions for over 250,000 companies across the USA and was compromised by a piece of malicious software planted inside the company’s network in order  to  record  payment  data  as  it  was  sent  by  retail  clients   Krebs,  2009 .  As  a  87   consequence, hackers were able to acquire information from 130 million credit and debit cards processed by 100,000 businesses  Vijayan, 2010 . The economic impact of such theft from  hacking  can  be  staggering.  Based  on  some  of  the  most  recent  available  data,  the Internet  Crime  Complaint  Center   2015   reported  that  in  2015  credit  card  fraud  and identity  theft  cost  US  consumers  over  $41  million  and  $57  million  respectively.  In addition, corporate data breaches in which business data were stolen cost the companies $39  million,  while  personal  data  breaches,  which  were  defined  as  security  incidents involving an individual’s sensitive, protected, or confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or used by an unauthorized individual, cost US citizens $43 million.  By contrast, hackers who engage in attacks at the behest of or in cooperation with a government or military entity may be referred to as nation-state actors  Brenner, 2008; Denning,  2010 .  Although  it  is  unclear  how  many  nation-state  hackers  there  are internationally, they are most likely a small number relative to the larger population of non-nation-state  actors.  The  targets  of  nation-state  actors’  attacks  differ  substantially. They frequently target government agencies, corporations, and universities using hacks to engage in both espionage and theft of intellectual property  Brenner, 2008 .  An  excellent  example  of  nation-state  sponsored  hacking  involves  the  creation  and dissemination  of  a  piece  of  malicious  software  called  Flame   see  Chapter  4  for  more details  on  malware .  It  is  thought  that  hackers  working  for  the  US  National  Security Agency  and or  the  Israeli  government  were  responsible  for  the  development  of  this malware,  which  was  identified  in  May  2012  by  security  researchers   Symantec,  2012; Zetter,  2012 .  The  program  was  found  to  have  infected  computers  in  government agencies, universities, and home computers, primarily in the Middle East, including Iran. There were, however, infections identified in Europe and North America.  The  malware  was  designed  to  target  specific  computers  and  serve  as  an  espionage tool, enabling backdoor access to any system files, the ability to remotely record audio, capture  keystrokes  and  network  traffic,  and  even  record  Skype  conversations   Cohen, 2012;  Zetter,  2012 .  One  of  the  most  unusual  features  of  this  code  was  that  it  could remotely turn on the infected computer’s Bluetooth functions in order to log the contact data  from  any  nearby  Bluetooth-enabled  device,  such  as  a  mobile  phone  or  tablet  Symantec, 2012 . The malware was also remotely wiped from all of these systems after it was made public, eliminating any evidence of the infections.  The complexity and utility of the tool suggested to researchers that it could have only been produced through the resources of a nation-state. In addition, the malware shared some common attack points with another well-known piece of malware called Stuxnet that has been heavily associated with the USA and Israel  see Chapter 10 for details on this program; Cohen, 2012; Zetter, 2012 . The computers targeted are also indicative of the interests of a nation-state due to the fact that it was originally identified on Iranian Oil Ministry computers and other systems across Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and various Middle  Eastern  nations.  Finally,  evidence  from  security  analysts  at  Kaspersky demonstrated  that  the  majority  of  infections  were  targeted  within  Iran  to  specifically acquire schematics, PDFs, text files, and technical diagrams  Lee, 2012 . The purpose of  88   these  attacks  was  to  acquire  information  about  the  Iranian  nuclear  program  and  spy surreptitiously on any actors associated with its development.  Over  the  past  two  decades,  there  have  been  an  increasing  number  of  attacks performed  by  non-nation-state  actors  against  government  and  industry  targets  due  to social conflicts both online and offline  Brenner, 2008; Denning, 2010; Kilger, 2010 . This was exemplified by the recent international conflict between Russia and Estonia over the removal  of  a  Russian  war  monument  from  a  national  memorial  garden  in  Estonia  in April 2006  Brenner, 2008; Jaffe, 2006; Landler and Markoff, 2008 . This action enraged Russian citizens living in Estonia and elsewhere, leading to protests and violence in the streets of both nations. Hackers soon began to target government and private resources in both nations, and co-opted actors outside of the hacker community to participate in their attacks  Brenner, 2008; Jaffe, 2006 . The attacks became so severe that portions of the  Estonian  government  and  financial  service  sector  were  completely  shut  down, causing substantive economic harm  Brenner, 2008; Landler and Markoff, 2008 .  For  more  information  on  the  Russia Estonia  cyber  conflict,  go  online  to: www.youtube.com watch?v=fzFc1HH6Z_k.  89   The human aspects of the hacker subculture  In  light  of  the  various  targets  affected  by  hacks,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  the individuals responsible for these attacks  see Box 3.1 for details . Individuals who utilize hacks  may  be  referred  to  as  hackers,  though  this  term  has  different  meanings  for different groups  Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Schell and Dodge, 2002; Taylor, 1999; Turkle, 1984 . Individuals within the hacker community may argue that a person can only be a hacker dependent on their level of skill or interest in technology  Holt, 2007; Jordan and Taylor, 1998 . Individuals in the general public may often define a hacker, however, as a young, antisocial nerd who can only relate to others via their computer  Furnell, 2002; Schell  and  Dodge,  2002 .  Hackers  may  also  be  viewed  as  misfits  who  are  involved  in criminal  or  illicit  activities,  or  perhaps  computer  technicians  within  corporations  or  at electronics retailers  Furnell, 2002; Schell and Dodge, 2002 .  Box 3.1 The Jargon File definition of hacking  http:  catb.org jargon html H hacker.html  1.  A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  The Jargon File provides a very distinct and well-accepted set of definitions for what constitutes a hacker. The definition also recognizes the differences between a hacker who is motivated by curiosity and intellect relative to malicious intent.  Empirical  studies  conducted  on  the  hacker  community  suggest  that  hackers  are predominantly under the age of 30, although there are older hackers as well working in the security community  Bachmann, 2010; Gilboa, 1996; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Schell and Dodge, 2002 . Younger people may be attracted to hacking because they have greater access  and  exposure  to  technology,  as  well  as  the  time  to  explore  technology  at  deep  90   levels.  Older  hackers  appear  to  be  gainfully  employed,  working  primarily  in  the computer security industry  Bachmann, 2010; Schell and Dodge, 2002 . Younger hackers may or may not be employed; some may be students in high school or universities. In fact, hackers tend to have a mix of both formal education and knowledge acquired on their  own  through  reading  and  experiential  learning   Bachmann,  2010;  Holt,  2007 . Limited  evidence  suggests  that  a  proportion  of  skilled  actors  may  have  at  least  a community  college  education,  while  a  small  number  have  degrees  from  four-year institutions  Bachmann, 2010; Holt, Soles, and Leslie, 2008; Holt, Kilger, Strumsky, and Smirnova, 2009; Schell and Dodge, 2002 .  Hackers also appear to be predominantly male, though it is unknown what constitutes the  true  gender  composition  of  the  subculture   Gilboa,  1996;  Jordan  and  Taylor,  1998; Schell  and  Dodge,  2002;  Taylor,  1999 .  This  is  because  most  hackers  conceal  their identities  from  others  online  and  are  especially  resistant  to  being  interviewed  or participating in research studies  Gilboa, 1996; Holt, 2007 . Thus, it is difficult to identify the overall composition of the hacker community at any given point in time.  There is also substantive evidence that hackers have a number of social relationships that  influence  their  willingness  to  engage  in  different  forms  of  behavior  over  time  Bossler and Burruss, 2011; Holt, Bossler, and May, 2012; Leukfeldt, Kleemans, and Stol, 2017;  Skinner  and  Fream,  1997 .  Peer  relationships  often  emerge  online  through involvement  in  forums,  IRC  channels,  and  other  forms  of  computer-mediated communication  Holt, 2009a; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Skinner and Fream, 1997 , though a portion may involve social relationships cultivated in the real world  Leukfeldt et al., 2017 .  This  is  true  not  only  for  those  interested  in  legitimate  hacking,  but  also  for criminal hacks. In fact, recent research on international networks of individuals involved in  phishing  and  malware  schemes  suggests  that  the  actors  depended  on  technical expertise  cultivated  technically  proficient  hackers communicated  Leuk-feldt et al., 2017   forums  where   from  web   These  associations  are  invaluable,  as  friends  and  relatives  can  provide  models  to  Morris  and  Blackburn,  2009;  Leukfeldt  et  al.,  2017 ,  positive imitate  hacks  encouragement  and  praise  for  unique  hacks,  and  justifications  for  behavior,  including excuses  and  beliefs  about  the  utility  of  malicious  hacks   Bossler  and  Burruss,  2011; Morris, 2011; Skinner and Fream, 1997 . In fact, many hackers deny any harm resulting from their actions  Gordon and Ma, 2003 , or blame their victims for having inadequate computer skills or systems to prevent victimization  Jordan and Taylor, 1998 .  There  are  many  communities  operating  via  CMCs  across  the  globe  for  hackers  at every  skill  level  to  identify  others  who  share  their  interests.  In  fact,  there  are  hacker- related  discussions  in  social  groups  via  Internet  Relay  Chat   IRC ,  forums,  blogs,  and other online environments  Holt, 2007, 2009a, 2009b; Leukfeldt et al., 2017 . Hackers have operated  in  bulletin  board  systems   BBSs   since  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s  to provide  information,  tools,  and  techniques  on  hacking   Meyer,  1989;  Scott,  2005 .  The content  was  posted  in  plain  text  and  occasionally  featured  images  and  art  made  from ASCII  text,  in  keeping  with  the  limitations  of  the  technology  at  the  time   see  91   www.asciiworld.com for examples . These sites allowed asynchronous communications between  users,  meaning  that  they  could  post  a  message  and  respond  to  others.  In addition,  individuals  hosted  downloadable  content  including  text  files  and  tutorials, though some also hosted pirated software and material, called warez  Meyer, 1989; for more on piracy, see Chapter 5 . The BBS became an important resource for new hackers, since  experienced  technology  users  and  budding  hackers  could  share  detailed information about systems they explored and discuss their exploits  Landreth, 1985 .  The BBS allowed hackers to form groups with private networks based on password- protected boards intended to keep out the uninitiated and maintain privacy  Landreth, 1985; Meyer, 1989 . Closed BBSs were initially local in nature based on telephone area codes,  but  changed  with  time  as  more  individuals  obtained  computers  and  sought  out others online. Local hacker groups grew to prominence as a result of BBSs based on their exploits and intrusions into sensitive computer systems, such as the Masters of Disaster and  the  Legion  of  Doom   Slatalla  and  Quittner,  1995 .  As  a  result,  it  is  common  for individuals to belong to multiple forums and websites in order to gain access to pivotal resources online.  For more information on what hacker BBSs looked like in the 1980s, go online to: http:  hackers.applearchives.com pirate-BBSs.html.  In  addition  to  online  relationships,  hackers  often  report  close  peer  associations  with individuals in the real world who are interested in hacking  Holt, 2009a, 2009b; Meyer, 1989; Schell and Dodge, 2002; Steinmetz, 2015 . These networks may form in schools or through  casual  associations  in  local  clubs.  There  are  also  local  chapters  of  national hacker conferences, like the DefCon or DC groups  Holt, 2009a . For example, local 2600 groups  began  to  form  around  the  publication  of  the  underground  hacker phreaker magazine  of  the  same  name  in  the  early  1980s   2600,  2011 .  These  chapters  operate  in order to bring interested individuals together to share their knowledge of computers and technology with others.  Similarly, hacker spaces have emerged over the past decade as a way for individuals with knowledge of technology to come together in order to share what they know with others  Hackerspaces, 2017 . There are now 2,138 hacker spaces listed, with 1,327 marked as  active  and  357  as  planned.  They  are  often  located  in  warehouses  or  large  buildings rented by non-profit groups in order to give individuals a chance to play with various  92   technologies  in  an  open  and  encouraging  environment   Hackerspaces,  2017 .  This stimulates interest in technology and expands individual social networks to relate to a larger number of people who share their interests.  For  more  www.hackerspaces.org .  information   regarding  hacker   spaces,   go  online   to:  There are also a number of regional and national conferences in the USA and Europe focusing on hacking and computer security. They range from regional cons organized by local  groups,  such  as  PhreakNIC  in  Nashville,  Tennessee,  and  CarolinaCon  in  Raleigh, North Carolina, to high-profile organized meetings arranged by for-profit industries like DefCon. DefCon has been held since 1993 and is now one of the pre-eminent computer security and hacking conferences in the world  DefCon, 2017 . The conference draws in speakers  and  attendees  from  law  enforcement,  the  intelligence  community,  computer security professionals, attorneys, and hackers of all skill levels for discussions on a range of  topics  covering  hardware  hacking,  phreaking,  cryptography,  privacy  laws,  and  the latest  exploits  and  vulnerabilities  in  everything  from  ATMs  to  cell  phone  operating systems  Holt, 2007 .  Similar cons are held around the world, such as the Chaos Communication Congress  CCC , which is the oldest hacker conference in Europe. The CCC has been held since 1984  in  various  locations  across  Germany,  with  more  than  9,000  attendees  in  2013  Kinkade, Bachmann, and Bachmann, 2013 . Thus, cons play an important role in sharing information about technology and connecting hackers in the real world which might not otherwise happen in online environments.  93   Hacking history  The 1950s: the origins  In  order  to  understand  the  hacker  community,  it  is  important  to  explain  its  historical evolution in the context of computing technology since its infancy in the late 1950s  see Table  3.1  for  details .  Some  researchers  argue  that  the  term  “hacking”  emerged  from engineering  students  at  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology   MIT   in  the  1950s  Levy, 2001 . This phrase was used by students to refer to playful, but skilled, tinkering with electronics and was largely synonymous with “goofing off” or “fooling around.” In fact, the MIT model railroad club  TMRC  used the term to describe their work on the club’s railroad systems  Levy, 2001 . They perceived hacking as a way to solve problems in spite of conventional techniques for engineering and electronics.  The emergence of computing in the 1950s in university settings like MIT, Cornell, and Harvard also facilitated the emergence of hacking. At the time, computing mainframes were  massive  systems  encompassing  whole  climate-controlled  rooms  with  relatively limited memory and overall processing power  Levy, 2001; see Box 3.2 for details . These devices were not linked together in any networked fashion as is the case with current computers, and individuals working with these systems had to develop their own unique solutions to problems experienced by programmers and users. Computer programmers who managed the systems of the time were often pressed to find ways to speed up the otherwise  slow  processing  of  their  mainframe  computers.  The  elegant  and  innovative solutions  to  these  problems  were  referred  to  as  “hacks,”  and  the  programmers responsible  were  identified  as  “hackers”  in  keeping  with  the  original  concept  as generated among the student body at MIT  Levy, 2001 .  Table 3.1 A timeline of notable events in the history of hacking  new mainframe computing systems being studied and developed on campus.  1955   The first computer hackers emerge at MIT.

As a result the story gets mass coverage and the US House  of Representatives holds hearings to discuss cyber-security.    The Hacker Magazine or Hagazine called 2600, and the online 'zine Phrack a year  1984  later, are created to give tips to upcoming hackers and phone phreaks.    The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 is passed, giving the Secret  Service jurisdiction over computer fraud.  1985   The first PC virus, called the Brain, is created. The virus used stealth techniques  for the first time and originated in Pakistan.  1986    As a result of numerous break-ins on government and corporate computer  systems, Congress passes the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it a  crime to break into computer systems. The law did not apply to juveniles.    The Morris Worm incident is caused by Robert T. Morris, the son of a chief  scientist of a division of the National Security Agency, and a graduate student at Cornell University. Morris plants a self-replicating worm on the government's  Arpanet in order to test what effect it would have on the UNIX system. The worm spread and clogged 6,000 networked computers belonging to the government and the university. As a result, Morris was expelled from Cornell, given probation, and  1988  fined $10,000.    The Computer Emergency Response Team  CERT  is created by DARPA   Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , an agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of new technologies for  use by the military.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation is founded in order to protect and defend the  rights of those investigated for computer hacking.    Operation Sundevil commences, a prolonged sting operation where Secret Service agents arrested prominent members of the BBSs in 14 US cities during early-morning raids and arrests. The arrests were aimed at cracking down on  credit card theft and telephone and wire fraud. This resulted in the breakdown in  the hacking community, whereby members were informing on each other in  exchange for immunity.  1993   DefCon hacking conference held in Las Vegas to say goodbye to BBSs.

Sometimes called “big iron,” a mainframe is a large-scale computer that can support thousands of users simultaneously and run vital operations reliably and securely. The mainframe probably got its name from massive metal frames that once housed it, often occupying thousands of square feet.  This  article  describes  the  early  phases  of  mainframe  computing  and  the  eventual transition from these room-sized devices to the laptops of today.  99   For  more  information  on  the  history  of  hacking  at  MIT,  go  online  to: http:  tmrc.mit.edu hackers-ref.html.  The 1960s and 1970s: the hacker ethic  The perception of the hacker as a skilled programmer and tinkerer continued through the 1960s.  The  social  upheaval  and  civil  unrest  experienced  during  this  decade,  however, would affect the ways in which hackers viewed their relationship with technology and the  larger  world.  As  computer  technology  moved  from  universities  into  military applications,  the  number  of  programmers  and  “hackers”  began  to  expand.  As  a consequence,  a  culture  of  programmers  emerged  based  on  a  series  of  ideas  called  the hacker ethic by Steven Levy  2001 :  1.  Access to computers – and anything that might teach you something about the  way the world works – should be unlimited and total.  2.  All information should be free. 3.  Mistrust authority – promote decentralization. 4.  Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees,  age, race, or position.  5.  You can create art and beauty on a computer. 6.  Computers can change your life for the better.  Although these six ideas are interrelated, the core belief within the hacker ethic is that information should be open and free to all so that individuals can understand how things work and identify ways in which they could be improved  Thomas, 2002 .  The importance of transparency through technology became even more salient in the 1970s with the introduction of two activities: phreaking and homebrew computing. The emergence of phone phreaking, or tampering with phone technology to understand and control  telephone  systems,  was  espoused  by  elements  of  the  1960s’  and  1970s’ counterculture movement  Landreth, 1985; Wang, 2006 . Individuals like Abbie Hoffman, an  activist  and  protestor  who  wrote  Steal  This  Book,  advised  people  to  engage  in phreaking  as  a  way  to  strike  out  against  telephone  companies  for  profiteering  from  a  100   wonderful  service.  Hoffman  and  other  groups  wanted  people  to  phreak  because  they could make free calls to anyone in the world by controlling telephone system switches through various devices and tones. The novel application and manipulation of telephony through  phreaking  led  this  activity  to  be  the  first  form  of  hacking  to  gain  a  broader audience outside of traditional computing.  The act of phreaking gained national attention in the mainstream media through an article  published  in  Esquire  magazine  on  John  Draper  and  various  other  “phreaks”  in 1971   Wang,  2006 .  Subsequently,  law  enforcement  and  telephone  security  began collaborative crackdowns to eliminate phreaks from penetrating telephony. The absence of  laws  pertaining  to  the  exploration  and  manipulation  of  computers  and  telephony made it difficult for police agencies until the late 1970s, when the first legal statutes were developed  Wang, 2006 . In fact, one of the first computer crime laws in the USA was passed in Florida in 1978 making all unauthorized access to computer systems a third- degree felony  Hollinger and Lanza-Kaduce, 1988 .  For  more  www.lospadres.info thorg lbb.html.  information  on  blue  boxes  and  phreaking,  go  online  to:  The 1970s also saw the emergence of hobbyist groups focused on the development of computer  hardware  and  software.  These  groups  operated  through  informal  meetings conducted  in  garages  and  other  settings  to  facilitate  conversations  on  the  design  and construction of personal computers  PCs . These hobbyists often used a combination of commercial  computer  kits  sold  through  magazines,  as  well  as  their  own  innovative designs  and  “hacks”  of  existing  resources.  Their  practices  helped  advance  the  state  of personal computing, though they did not typically refer to themselves or their activities as hacking  Ceruzzi, 1998 .  101   The 1980s: PCs, entertainment, and The Hacker Manifesto  The adoption of PC technology was initially slow, and did not take hold until the early 1980s  when  middle-income  families  began  to  purchase  computers.  The  concurrent explosion  of  video  games  and  home  electronic  entertainment  systems  exposed  young people  to  technology  as  never  before.  Young  people,  particularly  males,  were increasingly attracted to these devices and began to explore and use computers beyond their  advertised  value  as  learning  tools.  Similarly,  modem  technology,  which  connects computers to other computers and networks via telephone lines, improved and became accessible  to  the  common  home  user.  Individuals  who  had  never  before  had  access  to computer  technology  could  now  identify  and  explore  connected  computer  networks  Furnell,  2002 .  This  led  to  the  rise  of  the  bulletin  board  systems   BBS   culture  where local groups and hackers across the country could connect and share information with others   Slatalla  and  Quittner,  1995 .  At  the  same  time,  a  growing  underground  media began to publish homemade magazines on computers, hacking, and phreaking, such as Phrack  and 2600.  These  publications  helped  propel  individual  interests  in  hacking  and connect the burgeoning computer-using community together.  The  increasing  popularity  of  technology  among  the  general  public  led  to  increased media  attention  around  computers  and  youth.  This  was  due,  in  part,  to  the  theatrical release  of  the  movie WarGames,  which  featured  a  teenage  hacker  played  by  Matthew Broderick  who  unsuspectingly  gains  access  to  military  computer  systems  and  nearly causes a nuclear holocaust  Schneider, 2008 . The film piqued the curiosity of some youth and increased interest in hacking and computer use in general  see Box 3.3 for details .  Media  outlets  quickly  published  stories  on  malicious  hacker  groups  in  order  to capitalize on the public interest in computer misuse stemming from the film  Marbach, 1983a, 1983b . For instance, the FBI began raiding and filing suits against the members of a  local  group  of  hackers  known  as  the  “414s”  based  on  their  Milwaukee  area  code  Krance,  Murphy,  and  Elmer-Dewitt,  1983 .  The  teen  boys  compromised  protected networks but did not cause harm to systems or data  Hollinger and Lanza-Kaduce, 1988 . Their  acts  drew  attention  from  both  federal  law  enforcement  and  the  media  to  the growing  perceived  use  of  hacking  for  criminal  purposes.  Thus,  this  marked  a  distinct divergence in the concept of hacking and hackers from the notion in the 1950s and 1960s of ethical computer tinkerers to a more criminal orientation.

Because right after that war dialers came out [.] programs that you could download to your computer that were all over the BBS that you could download that would call up people’s computers and just look for modem  tones.  And  then,  they’d  record  the  greetings  that  the  computers  gave.  Everybody  was  friendly back then so when you dialed into a computer, it gave you the identification of who the computer was and [.] if it was governmental or something like that. It would either tell you, you know this is so and so’s computer or simply would not tell you anything and that would be a flag that hey, this is, you know, is something worth looking at. If it just asked you for your username and password, then maybe I need to go in here. Most of ’em didn’t even ask for user-names. They just wanted passwords. [.] So you start doing things and when I got my first modem, WarGames came out as a movie and I saw all these dialers and I thought you know, this is cool. And so you download one of the dialers and you run it. You check every phone number in your neighborhood and after it had checked for five days and like come up with four numbers  or  whatever  and  you  would  take  those  numbers  and  call  ’em  and  you  would  get  the  greeting protocols. And from that point in time you’d bring in your second program which was just, it would dial up, connect, and then it would randomly generate a password. Try to get through and it would keep doing it [.] so you would take this wardialer and you would tell it, okay I’m going to dial every phone number in there looking for a modem and hang up. And you know if I don’t get a modem in so much time, hang up, go to the next one. So the people think they get a hang-up phone call, it’s annoying, but that’s it. When you finally do get one, it sends across its I-identification which was usually a welcome greeting, “welcome to blah-blah blah-blah-blah” and [.] it would record that and then you’d go through at the end of, you know, after you’d let it sit for however long it took to go through that exchange and for the ten thousand numbers in the exchange it might take eight hours. You’d come back at the end of eight hours you’d look at all your greetings and see if any of ’em were what you were looking for. Once you knew they were what you were looking for then it was a matter of brute forcing the passwords.  Interview conducted with Mac Diesel by Thomas J. Holt.  The criminalization of hacking and the growing schism in the hacker community was exacerbated by the publication of a brief text called The Conscience of a Hacker, or The Hacker Manifesto  Furnell, 2002 . The document was written by “The Mentor” in 1986 and was first published in the magazine Phrack. “The Mentor” railed against adults, law enforcement,  and  schools,  arguing  that  hackers  seek  knowledge  even  if  that  means breaking into or gaining access to protected computer systems. These activities do not make  hackers  criminals  according  to  “The  Mentor,”  but  rather  misunderstood  and unappreciated  by  adults  who  have  no  concept  of  the  value  of  technology.  He  also encouraged hackers to engage in phreaking because telephone companies were “run by profiteering gluttons.” This document supported some of the criminal aspects of hacking that were in opposition to the 1960s’ concept of hacking and the broader hacker ethic. As a consequence, a rift began to form among hackers based on their support of either the Manifesto or the hacker ethic, as well as their perception of malicious and exploratory  103   hacks.  In fact, there are two terms used by some to attempt to differentiate between hackers who seek to harm or destroy systems and those who do not. The term crack emerged within the hacker subculture to recognize and separate malicious hacks from those acts supported by the hacker ethic  Furnell, 2002; Holt, 2010 . Those who engage in deviant or criminal applications of hacking could be labeled crackers, since true hackers consider destructive hackers to be “a lower form of life”  Furnell, 2002 . Thus, the act of cracking is thought to be different from hacking based on the outcome of the attack and not the techniques applied by the actor.  the   For  www.phrack.org issues 7 3.htmlarticle.  full   text  of  The  Hacker  Manifesto,  go  online   to:  The  criminalization  of  hacking  continued  through  the  creation  of  the  federal Counterfeit  Access  Device  and  Computer  Fraud  and  Abuse  Act  of  1984,  and  its subsequent revision in 1986. The 1984 law focused initially on the use and abuse of credit card information and established that any criminal incident involving a loss of $5,000 or more  was  a  federal  offense  to  be  handled  by  the  Secret  Service   Hollinger  and  Lanza- Kaduce, 1988 . The 1986 revision of this Act, however, expanded legal protections to all computerized information maintained by banks and financial institutions.  Furthermore, the law added three new violations:  1  unauthorized access to computer systems  with  the  intent  to  defraud;   2   unauthorized  access  with  intent  to  cause malicious  damage;  and   3   the  trafficking  of  computer  passwords  with  the  intent  to defraud   Taylor,  Fritsch,  Lieberbach,  and  Holt,  2010 .  These  laws  not  only  codified criminal  applications  of  hacking,  but  also  afforded  police  agencies  with  better  tools  to prosecute the activities of hackers across the country  Hollinger and Lanza-Kaduce, 1988; Sterling,  1992;  Taylor  et  al.,  2010 .  In  turn,  multiple  high-profile  law  enforcement investigations  developed  during  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  such  as  the  pursuit  of Kevin Mitnick  Shimomura and Markoff, 1996; see Box 3.4 for details  and Kevin Poulsen  Littman, 1997 .  104   Box 3.4 The criminal exploits of Kevin Mitnick  Mitnick's own words about his "hacking" - forbes.cominterview5 99  www.forbes.com 1999 04 05 feat.html.

The myth of Kevin Mitnick is much more interesting than the reality of Kevin Mitnick. If they told the reality, no one would care [.]  In this article, Kevin Mitnick discusses his hacks and his life during incarceration for violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He also discusses his thoughts on the post-release conditions he would have to live with once he completed his prison sentence.  As technology became increasingly user friendly and affordable in the early 1990s, the hacker population continued to expand. The hacker subculture became more segmented based on the use of perceived unethical hacking techniques by the increasing number of young hackers  Taylor, 1999 . For instance, modern hackers would typically attempt to gather internal documents after accessing a system, both for bragging rights and to allow for the free exchange of information through the hacker network. This desire to spread information and discuss attack techniques afforded a mechanism for law enforcement to gather evidence of illegal activities  Holt, 2007 . As a consequence, the free exchange of information within the hacker community began to evolve into trying to diminish the likelihood of detection and prosecution  Kilger, 2010; Taylor, 1999 . Local hacker groups began  to  support  conferences  on  the  topic  of  hacking  in  the  USA,  including  DefCon, Hackers  On  Planet  Earth   HOPE ,  and  PumpCon   see  Table  3.2  for  details .  Similar conferences  have  been  held  since  the  mid-1980s  in  Germany,  such  as  the  Chaos Communication  Congress   CCC ,  which  began  in  1984  in  Hamburg,  then  moved  to Berlin in 1998  Kinkade et al., 2013 . These meetings afforded the opportunity to connect in the real world and gave the hacker population an air of respectability in the face of increasing criminal prosecutions of hacker groups  Holt, 2007 .  105   Table 3.2 A timeline of computer hacking conferences    Chaos Communication Congress, Europe's largest hacker conference, began in Berlin and was held by the Chaos Computer Club. There are four sections of the event, including: the Conference, the HackCenter, Art and Beauty, and the Phone Operation Center. The main topic categories of the event include: Hacking, Science,  1984  Community, Society, and Culture.    SummerCon, one of the oldest conventions in the USA, began and was run by  Phrack in St. Louis, Missouri until 1995. The SummerCon conference influenced the HOPE and DefCon conferences. The Legion of Doom took over in 1995 and moved the conference to Atlanta, Georgia. After this, the conference was held in numerous  locations such as Washington, DC, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Austin, Texas.   HoHoCon Conference began in Houston, Texas during Christmas from 1990 to  1994. The event was sponsored by Drunkfux, Dead Cow, and Phrack. The  conference, being one of the largest and most influential gatherings, influenced the  1987  1990  DefCon and HOPE conferences.    DefCon, held initially in Las Vegas, Nevada, began; it is the world's largest annual  hacker convention to this day.

Some  believed  that  this  was  an  important transition back to the origins of the hacker ethic, while others viewed the change from  108   hacker to security professional as a process of selling out and betraying the very nature of open exchange within the hacker community  Taylor, 1999 .  The  prosecution  and  detention  of  Kevin  Mitnick  exacerbated  this  issue  in  the  mid- 1990s. Mitnick was viewed as a hero by the hacker community because of his substantial skill  and  the  overly  harsh  treatment  of  him  at  the  hands  of  law  enforcement  and prosecutors  Taylor et al., 2010 . In fact, federal prosecutors barred Mitnick from using a computer  or  Internet-connected  device  for  several  years  following  his  release  from  a federal prison due to fears that he might cause substantial harm to telephony or private industry   Painter,  2001 .  Many  hackers  donated  to  Mitnick’s  legal  defense  fund  and believed that he was a scapegoat of fearmongering by legislators and law enforcement  Taylor et al.,  2010 .  Shortly  after  his  release  from  prison,  Mitnick  began  a  computer security consulting business and angered those in the subculture who viewed this as a betrayal of the basic principles of the hacker community. As a result, he lost a great deal of respect but provided a model for others to transition from known criminal to security insider in an increasingly technologically driven society.

The  global  expansion  of  connectivity  afforded  by  the Internet  led  to  the  digitization  of  sensitive  financial  and  government  information  and massive databases accessible online. Financial service providers and business platforms moved  to  online  environments  to  provide  services  directly  to  home  computer  users, offering  convenient  modes  of  communication  and  shopping.  As  a  consequence,  the landscape  and  dynamics  of  computer  hacking  and  the  computer  security  industry changed.  The  motives  for  hacking  also  shifted  during  this  period  from  acquiring  status  and acceptance from the social groups that dominated hacking in the 1980s and 1990s toward economic gain  Chu et al., 2010; Kilger, 2010; Holt and Lampke, 2010 . The complexity of the tools used by hackers increased, and their functionality changed from infecting and degrading  global  networks  information surreptitiously.  In  fact,  the  problem  of  phishing,  where  consumers  are  tricked  into transmitting  financial  information  to  fraudulent  websites  where  the  information  is  to  attacking  and   sensitive   stealing   109   housed for later fraud, grew in the late 1990s and early 2000s  James, 2005; Wall, 2007 . These  crimes  are  particularly  costly  for  both  the  individual  victim  and  financial institutions  alike.  According  to  the  Anti-Phishing  Working  Group   2016 ,  there  were 466,065  unique  phishing  websites  detected  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  and  another 364,424  phishing  websites  found  in  the  third  quarter.  In  addition,  353  brands  were targeted by phishing campaigns on average each month in the third quarter of 2016.  During this time, individuals began to apply hacking techniques and skills in attacks based on political and social agendas against government and private industry targets. For  instance,  members  of  the  hacker  collective,  the  “Electronic  Disturbance  Theater,” created and released an attack tool called Flood-Net  Denning, 2010; Jordan and Taylor, 2004 .  This  program  was  designed  as  a  standalone  tool  to  enable  unskilled  actors  to engage  in denial-of-service  attacks  against  various  government  services  as  a  form  of “civil  disobedience”   Cere,  2003;  Schell  and  Dodge,  2002 .  Such  an  attack  prevents individuals  from  being  able  to  use  communications  services,  thereby  rendering  them useless.  This  tool  was  first  employed  in  an  attack  against  the  Mexican  government because of their treatment of Zapatista separatists who were fighting against what they perceived to be governmental repression  Denning, 2010 .  Box 3.5 The electronic disturbance theater and cyber-  attacks  Tactical poetics: FloodNet's virtual sit-ins  http:  rhizome.org editorial 2016 dec 01 tactical-poetics-floodnets-early-1990s- virtual-sit-ins .  It was a simple Java applet designed to rapidly reload a given webpage, but in the hands of these artists, it became a powerful “weapon of collective presence” and conceptual artwork – an exercise in “tactical poetics.”  In this essay, the role of FloodNet as a tool of protest and its association with the corporeal and virtual is discussed in detail. Examining the use of FloodNet as a tool for attacks in the 1990s demonstrates the thoughtful nature of hacking depending on the motive of the attacker.  110   Similarly, hackers in India and Pakistan engaged in a series of defacement attacks over a  four-year  period  from  1998  to  2001  due  to  the  use  of  nuclear  weapons  testing  and development  in  India   Denning,  2010 .  Web  defacements  allow  an  actor  to  replace  the original web page with content of their own design, including text and images. Such an attack is an ideal mechanism for politically motivated attackers to express their attitudes and beliefs to the larger world. Thus, the number of defacements increased dramatically during  this  period  as  more  countries  became  connected  to  the  Internet  and  saw  this environment  as  a  means  to  express  their  political  and  religious  ideologies   Denning, 2010 . To understand how hacking is used as a method for both legitimate and malicious activities  that  affect  individuals  and  governments  around  the  world,  it  is  necessary  to examine  the  modern  hacker  subculture  and  its  influence  on  structuring  the  hacker identity.

Box 3.6 The ongoing conflict between Indian and  Pakistani hackers  Hackers from India, Pakistan in full-blown online war - gadgetsnow.com 10-14  www.gadgetsnow.com tech-news Hackers-from-India-Pakistan-in-full-blown- online-war articleshow 44766898.cms.  111   Even as gunfire continues to be traded across the Indo–Pak border, a full-blown hacking and defacement war has erupted in cyberspace. On Thursday, over a dozen Indian and Pakistani websites were defaced by hackers from either side of the fence.  In this article, the various attacks between hacker crews in both India and Pakistan are detailed. This includes targeted defacements against government, industry, and educational  institution  websites,  due  in  part  to  physical  conflict  between  the  two nations.  112   The modern hacker subculture  The activities of hackers are driven, in large part, by the values and beliefs of the modern hacker  subculture.  Three  primary  norms  within  the  hacker  community  have  been identified  across  multiple  studies:   1   technology;   2   knowledge;  and   3   secrecy   Holt, 2007; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Meyer, 1989; Steinmetz, 2015; Taylor, 1999; Thomas, 2002 . These  norms  structure  the  activities  and  interests  of  hackers  regardless  of  their involvement in ethical or malicious hacks; they are highly interconnected and important in understanding the overall hacker subculture.  Technology  The  act  of  hacking  has  been  directly  and  intimately  tied  to  technology  since  the development of the term “hack” in the 1950s  Holt, 2007; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Meyer, 1989; Steinmetz, 2015; Taylor, 1999; Thomas, 2002 . The interests and activities of hackers center on computer software and hardware, as well as associated devices like electronics, video games, and cell phones  Holt, 2007; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Turkle, 1984 . These interests  are  interrelated,  since  understanding  hardware  can  improve  an  individual’s understanding  of  software  and  vice  versa.  Thus,  an  individual’s  connection  to technology and their sense of ownership over the tools of their “craft”  Steinmetz, 2015  increases their ability to hack  Holt, 2007; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Taylor, 1999; Thomas, 2002 .  To  generate  such  a  connection,  hackers  must  develop  a  deep  appreciation  of computers and be willing to explore and apply their knowledge in new ways  Jordan and Taylor,  1998 .  Hackers  must  be  curious  and  explore  technology  often  through  creative play  with  devices,  hardware,  and  software.  For  instance,  one  of  the  most  well-known hackers is John Draper, also known as Cap’n Crunch. He was very active in the 1970s and 1980s in the hacker community and is known for having blown a giveaway whistle found  in  a  box  of  Cap’n  Crunch  cereal  into  his  phone  receiver   Furnell,  2002;  Wang, 2006 .  The  whistle  created  the  perfect  2600  Hz  tone  that  was  necessary  to  enable  an individual  to  connect  to  long-distance  lines  at  that  time.  Such  an  act  of  hacking  the telephone system is known as phreaking, combining the notion of “phone” and “hack- ing”   Furnell,  2002;  Holt,  2010;  Wang,  2006 .  Draper’s  unique  application  of  phreaking knowledge  through  the  use  of  a  simple  children’s  toy  garnered  a  great  deal  of  respect and  attention  from  the  phreaking  community  and  popular  media.  In  turn,  this  act demonstrates the importance of exploration and creativity in the hacker community.  The importance of technology for hackers often emerges early in youth. Many who become involved in the hacker community report developing an interest in technology at  113   an  early  age.  Many  hackers  report  gaining  access  to  computers  in  their  early  teens  or even younger  Bachmann, 2010; Holt, 2007 . Simply using computers in public cafés and schools  can  also  help  pique  a  hacker’s  interest  in  technology   Holt,  2010 .  Identifying peers who share their affinity for technology online or offline is also extremely valuable because it helps maintain their interests. Hackers maintain loose peer associations with individuals in online environments that may be useful in the development of their skill and  ability   Holt,  2009a,  2009b;  Holt  and  Kilger,  2008;  Meyer,  1989;  Schell  and  Dodge, 2002; Taylor, 1999 .  Knowledge  The central importance of technology in this subculture drives individuals to form a deep commitment  to  having  knowledge  and  mastery  of  a  variety  of  technological  tools, including  hardware  and  software   Meyer  1989;  Holt,  2007;  Steinmetz,  2015;  Thomas, 2002 . Hackers spend a significant amount of time learning about technology in order to understand  how  devices  work  at  deep  levels.  The  hacker  community  stresses  that individuals need to learn on their own rather than ask others to teach them how to do things  Holt, 2007; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Taylor, 1999 . Although social connections provide access to information and accumulated knowledge, the idea of being a hacker is driven  in  part  by  curiosity  and  experiential  knowledge  that  can  only  be  developed through personal experience.  An individual interested in hacking cannot simply ask others to teach them how to hack  Holt, 2007; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Taylor, 1999 . Such a request would lead to a person  being  ridiculed  or  mocked  and  embarrassed  publicly  by  others.  Instead,  most hackers learn by spending hours every day reading manuals, tutorials, and forum posts in order to learn new things  Holt, 2007, 2009a; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Taylor, 1999 . Hackers also belong to multiple forums, mailing lists, and groups in order to gain access to  resources  and  information   Holt,  2007,  2009a;  Holt  and  Kilger,  2008;  Meyer,  1989; Taylor, 1999 . The increasing importance of video-sharing sites has also enabled people to  create  tutorials  that  describe  in  explicit  detail  and  demonstrate  how  to  hack.  For instance,  Turkish  hackers  regularly  post  videos  on  YouTube  and  hacker  forums  that explain  in  detail  how  certain  hacks  work  so  that  they  can  help  others  learn  about technology  Holt, 2009b . Constant changes in technology also require hackers to stay on the cutting edge of innovations in computer hardware and software in order to improve their overall understanding of the field.  Individuals who can apply their knowledge of technology in a practical fashion often garner respect from others within the subculture. The hacker subculture is a meritocracy where individuals are judged on the basis of their knowledge of computer hardware and software. Those with the greatest skill have the most status, while those with little to no ability but a desire to hack receive the least respect from others. Hackers who create new tools,  identify  unknown  exploits,  and  find  novel  applications  of  technology  often  114   generate  media  attention  and  respect  from  their  peers  in  forums  and  blogs. Demonstrations of technological mastery provide cues that they are a hacker with some skill and ability. By contrast, individuals who engage in poorly executed hacks or have minimal skills but try to brag about their activities may be ostracized by others  Holt, 2007; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Meyer, 1989; Steinmetz, 2015 .  One of the most salient demonstrations of mastery of technology may be seen at cons, where  individuals  can  compete  in  hacking  challenges  and  competitions.  For  example, DefCon  and  some  regional  cons  hold  Capture  the  Flag   CTF   competitions  where hackers compete against each other individually or in teams to hack one another, while at  the  same  time  defending  their  resources  from  others.  This  demonstrates  the  dual nature  of  hacking  techniques  for  both  attack  and  defense.  Many  cons  also  hold  trivia competitions  with  questions  about  computer  hardware,  software,  programming,  video games,  and  the  exploits  of  well-known  hackers.  These  games  allow  individuals  to demonstrate their understanding of and connection to the social history of hacking, as well  as  their  technical  knowledge.  The  winners  of  these  competitions  are  usually recognized  at  the  end  of  the  con  and  are  given  prizes  for  their  accomplishment.  Such recognition  from  the  general  public  helps  validate  an  individual’s  knowledge  and  skill and demonstrate their mastery over social and technical challenges  Holt, 2009a .  For  more  information  on  CTFs,  go  online  to:  www.youtube.com watch? v=giAe7wU4r2o.  The importance of knowledge is also reflected in the way in which hackers refer to individuals  within  the  hacker  subculture,  as  well  as  those  who  operate  outside  of  it  Furnell,  2002;  Holt,  2007,  2010;  Jordan  and  Taylor,  1998;  Taylor,  1999 .  There  are  a variety of terms used to describe hackers. Individuals who are new to hacking and have minimal knowledge of technology may be referred to as a noob or newbie  Holt, 2010 . This may be used derogatorily in order to embarrass that person, although many simply identify  themselves  as  noobs  in  order  to  clearly  delineate  the  fact  that  they  may  not know  much  about  technology.  Regardless,  those  who  are  considered  noobs  generally have no status within the hacker community  Furnell, 2002; Holt, 2010 .  As hackers learn and gain an understanding of computer software and hardware, they may  attempt  to  apply  their  knowledge  with  limited  success.  One  of  the  key  ways  in which a person may hack early on involves the use of tools and kits found on hacker  115   websites  and  forums   Bachmann,  2010;  Furnell,  2002;  Holt,  2010 .  The  proliferation  of hacker  tools  over  the  past  two  decades  has  made  it  relatively  easy  for  individuals  to engage  in  various  hacks  because  these  resources  automate  the  use  of  exploits  against known  vulnerabilities.  The  ability  to  hack  a  target  quickly  and  easily  is  enticing  for individuals who are new to the subculture because they may feel that such an act will garner status or respect from others  Furnell, 2002; Holt, 2007; Taylor, 1999 . They do not, however, understand the way in which these tools actually affect computer systems, so their attacks often fail or cause greater harm than initially intended. As a consequence, many  within  the  hacker  subculture  use  the  term  script  kiddies  to  refer  to  such individuals and their acts  Furnell, 2002; Holt, 2007, 2010; Taylor, 1999 . This derogatory term is meant to shame individuals by recognizing their use of pre-made scripts or tools, their lack of skill, and the concurrent harm they may cause. In addition, older members of  the  hacker  community  may  also  refer  to  noobs  or  script  kiddies  as  lamers  or wannabes, referencing their limited capacity and skills  Furnell, 2002 .  Those hackers who spend a great deal of time developing a connection to technology and robust understanding of computers may be able to demonstrate that they are more than  just  a  noob  or  script  kiddie   see  Holt,  2010 .  Eventually,  they  may  be  able  to demonstrate enough capacity to be viewed as a hacker, or even a leet  1337 , by others in the  subculture.  There  is  no  single  way,  however,  to  determine  when  a  person  is “officially” considered a hacker or a leet  Holt, 2007 . For instance, some people may not refer to themselves as hackers because they feel that being a hacker is something that others must apply to you, rather than something you can bestow upon yourself  Holt, 2007 . Thus, they may simply allow others to call them a hacker rather than use the term on their own. Others argue that becoming a hacker is based on experience, such that you are  only  a  hacker  after  you  can  use  various  programming  languages,  repair  your  own computer, and create your own tools and scripts  Holt, 2007; Taylor, 1999 .  Within the community of skilled hackers, some use the terms white hat, black hat, or gray hat to refer to an actor based on the way they apply their knowledge  see Furnell, 2002; Holt, 2007, 2010; Thomas, 2002 . White hats are thought to be “ethical” hackers who work  to  find  errors  in  computer  systems  and  programs  to  benefit  general  computer security  Furnell, 2002; Holt, 2007, 2010 . Black-hat hackers use the same techniques and vulnerabilities  in  order  to  gain  access  to  information  or  harm  systems   Furnell,  2002; Holt, 2007, 2010 . Thus, black hats may sometimes argue that they are no different from white hats; instead it is a perceptual difference among security professionals  Holt, 2007 . Gray-hat  hackers  fall  somewhere  between  these  two  camps,  as  their  motives  shift  or change  depending  on  the  specific  situation   Furnell,  2002;  Holt,  2010 .  The  ambiguous nature of hacker ethics, however, makes it difficult to clearly identify when someone is acting purely in a black or white context. A term like “gray hat” is used to identify the ethical  flexibility  and  lack  of  consistency  in  individual  hackers’  actions   Furnell,  2002; Holt, 2007, 2010; Jordan and Taylor, 1998 . A gray-hat hacker may use their knowledge for  beneficial  purposes  one  day,  while  breaking  into  a  computer  system  to  steal information  the  following  day.  Thus,  there  is  significant  variation  in  the  actions  of  116   skilled hackers.  Secrecy  The  importance  which  hackers  place  on  demonstrations  of  knowledge  and  deep commitment  to  technology  creates  a  unique  tension  within  the  hacker  subculture:  the need for secrecy  Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Taylor, 1999; Thomas, 2002 . Since some forms of hacking are illegal, an individual who attempts to brag about their activities to others can place themselves at risk of arrest or legal sanctions  Kilger, 2010; Taylor, 1999 . This does  not  stop  hackers  talking  about  or  engaging  in  illicit  activities  in  relatively  public arenas online. Instead, they use various techniques to reduce the likelihood that their real identity  is  compromised,  such  as  handles  or  nicknames  in  online  and  offline environments  in  order  to  establish  an  identity  separate  from  their  real  identity   see Furnell, 2002; Jordan and Taylor, 1998 . Handles serve as a digital representation of self. They may be humorous or serious, depending on the individual. For example, one hacker adopted  the  handle  TweetyFish  under  the  assumption  that  no  judge  would  ever  take seriously  criminal  hacks  associated  with  that  name   Furnell,  2002 .  Others  take  names that are associated with scofflaws and villains, like the group the Legion of Doom in the 1980s,  or  that  represent  violence  and  pillaging,  like  Erik  Bloodaxe   Furnell,  2002 . Regardless of the handle an individual chooses, its use helps create a persona that can be responsible  for  successful  hacks  and  activities  and  diminish  the  likelihood  of  reprisals from law enforcement  Furnell, 2002; Jordan and Taylor, 1998; Taylor et al., 2010 .  Some hackers also attempt to segment themselves and to shield their activities from the  general  public  through  the  use  of  closed  web  forums  and  private  message  boards. Requiring individuals to register with a website or forum helps give some modicum of privacy for posters and diminishes the likelihood that anyone in the general public may stumble upon their conversations  Meyer, 1989 . Law enforcement officers and computer security researchers can still gain access to these forums and generate information about serious hacks and attacks, though it is harder to identify these resources when they are closely guarded secrets. In fact, some hacker groups prevent their sites from appearing in search  engine  results  like  Google  by  turning  off  the  feature  “robots.txt”  in  the  html coding  Chu et al., 2010 . This prevents web spiders from logging the site and reduces the likelihood  that  outsiders  may  access  their  resources.  Individuals  within  the  hacker subculture can still identify and gain access to these resources. Hackers, therefore, tread a fine line between sharing information and keeping certain knowledge private  Jordan and Taylor, 1998 .  The issue of secrecy has also affected the way in which individuals engage with one another  at  conferences  and  in  public  settings.  The  substantive  increase  in  law enforcement investigations of hackers and the concurrent incorporation of hackers into government  and  private  industry  to  secure  resources  means  that  individual  attendees may be surrounded by people who are focused on identifying malicious hackers  Holt,  117   2007, 2010; Schell and Dodge, 2002 . Conferences like DefCon have actively attempted to single out when an individual is in such a position through their “Spot the Fed” contest  Holt,  2007 .  The  game  involves  pulling  an  attendee  out  of  the  crowd  who  people perceive to be a federal agent and asking them a series of questions about their life and job. If the person is, in fact, a federal agent, both the fed and the spotter receive T-shirts to commemorate the experience  Holt, 2007 .  To  see  “Spot  the  Fed”  in  action,  go  online  to:  www.youtube.com watch? v=oMHZ4qQuYyE.  The Spot the Fed game was initially designed to draw attention to the presence of law enforcement at the con, and to stress the need to carefully manage what is shared with strangers in the open. The game also helps demonstrate the boundaries between hackers and  law  enforcement,  and  sheds  light  on  the  role  of  law  enforcement  in  the  hacker subculture.  Over  time,  however,  the  game  has  become  much  more  playful,  and  has occurred with less frequency as the conference has become a more established part of the computer security community. The presence of such a game still emphasizes the need for secrecy in managing how hackers interact with others online and offline.  118   Legal frameworks to prosecute hacking  The  federal  government  within  the  USA  is  the  primary  level  of  government  that attempts  to  curtail  computer-hacking  activities  by  passing  and  enforcing  legislation through  various  agencies.  At  the  federal  level,  the  primary  statutes  used  to  prosecute hacking cases are referred to as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  CFAA , discussed previously. This Act, listed as Section 1030 of Title 18 of the US Criminal Code, was first passed in 1986 and has been revised multiple times over the past three decades. These laws  prosecute  attacks  against  a  “protected  computer,”  which  is  defined  as  any computer  used  exclusively  or  non-exclusively  by  a  financial  institution  or  the  federal government, as well as any computer used to engage in interstate or foreign commerce or communication generally  Brenner, 2011 . This broad definition was adopted in 1996 in order to provide protection to virtually any computer connected to the Internet and to increase the efficacy of federal statutes to prosecute hacking crimes  Brenner, 2011 .  The CFAA stipulates seven applications of hacking as violations of federal law, though here we will focus on four of these statutes  18 USC § 1030 . The other three statutes are discussed  in  Chapter  4  because  they  pertain  more  to  malicious  software  and  certain attacks  that  may  extend  beyond  or  can  be  completed  without  the  use  of  computer hacking. With that in mind, there are four offenses that immediately pertain to hacking as discussed thus far:  1.  Knowingly  accessing  a  computer  without  authorization  or  by  exceeding authorized  access  and  obtaining  information  protected  against  disclosure which could be used to the disadvantage of the USA or to the advantage of a foreign  nation  and  willfully  deliver  that  information  to  another  person  not entitled  to  receive  it  or  retain  the  information  and  refuse  to  deliver  it  to  the person entitled to receive it  18 USC § 1030 Sect.  a  1  .  2.  Knowingly  accessing  a  computer  without  authorization  or  by  exceeding  authorized access to:  a.  Obtain  information  contained  in  a  financial  record  of  a  financial institution  or  of  a  card  issuer  or  contained  in  a  file  of  a  consumer reporting agency on a consumer;  b.  Obtain information from any federal department or agency; c.  Information  from  any  protected  computer   18  USC  §  1030  Sect.   a    2  .  3.  To intentionally and without authorization access any non-public computer of a US department or agency that is exclusively for the use of the government and affects the use of that computer  18 USC § 1030 Sect.  a  3  .  119   4.  To  knowingly  and  with  the  intent  to  defraud  access  a  protected  computer without  authorization  or  by  exceeding  authorized  access  and  thereby  further the intended fraud and obtaining anything of value  18 USC § 1030 Sect.  a  4  .  These acts cover a wide range of offenses and are written broadly enough to prosecute hackers  regardless  of  whether  they  are  internal  or  external  attackers   Brenner,  2008; Furnell, 2002 . Specifically, an internal attacker is an individual who is authorized to use and  has  legitimate  access  to  computers,  networks,  and  certain  data  stored  on  these systems.  For  example,  college  students  are  typically  allowed  to  use  online  registration systems, access course content hosted on Blackboard or other learning sites, and to use computer  systems  on  campus  through  a  username  and  password  sign-in  system.  They are not, however, allowed to enter grades or use sensitive systems reserved for faculty and administrators. If a student wanted to change their grades electronically, they would have  to  exceed  their  authorized  use  by  guessing  a  password  or  exploiting  a  system’s vulnerability  in  order  to  gain  access  to  grading  systems.  Thus,  their  use  of  existing internal resources makes them an internal attacker. Someone who attempts to change grades or access sensitive systems, but is not a student or an authorized user, would be defined as an external attacker  Brenner, 2008; Furnell, 2002 . This is because they have no  existing  relationship  with  the  network  owners  and  are  completely  outside  of  the network.

For example, the minimum sentence for these crimes can be a 10- to 20-year sentence related to acts of trespass designed to obtain national security information  Sect.  a  1  , while  simply  accessing  a  computer  and  obtaining  information  of  value   Sect.   a  2   varies from one year in prison and or a fine, to up to ten years if the offender has either multiple charges brought against them or if they engaged in the offense for commercial or  private  gain   18  USC  §  1030 .  Individuals  who  trespass  on  government-controlled computers  Sect.  a  3   can receive both a fine and imprisonment for not more than one year, though if it is part of another offense it may be up to ten years.  120   The  greatest  sentencing  range  involves  attempts  to  access  a  computer  in  order  to engage in fraud and obtain information  Sect.  a  4  . If the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of that use does not exceed $5,000 in any one-year period, then the maximum penalty is a fine and up to five years in prison. If the incident involves harm that exceeds $5,000, affects more than ten computers, affects medical data, causes physical injury to a person, poses a threat to public health or safety, or affects the US government’s administration of justice, defense, or national security, then the punishments can start at ten years and or a fine  18 USC § 1030 . If the hack either attempts to cause or results in serious bodily injury, the actor can receive up to 20 years in prison, and he or she can be eligible for a life sentence if the hack either knowingly or recklessly caused death. These changes were a direct result of the Cyber Security Enhancement Act, which was a subsection of the Homeland Security Act of 2002  Brenner, 2011; 18 USC § 1030; see also Chapter 10 . This Act amended the punishments available to federal judges when dealing with cybercrime cases in order to more  accurately  reflect  the  severity  of  harm  that  may  result  from  hackers’  attacks against computer systems and data.  The  CFAA  also  allows  victims  of  hacking  cases  to  pursue  civil  suits  against  the attacker  18 USC § 1030 . Specifically, the statute allows any person who suffers either damage or losses due to a violation of the CFAA the opportunity to seek compensatory damages within two years of the date of the complaint or discovery of damages. It does not place limits on the amount of damages an individual may seek, though the statute stipulates that computer software and hardware manufacturers cannot be held liable for negligent designs or manufacturing  Brenner, 2011 . As a result, this essentially releases a vendor  from  any  civil  responsibility  for  the  presence  of  vulnerabilities  within  their products.  Instead,  it  is  the  attacker  who  is  held  liable  for  the  identification  and  use  of exploits against those vulnerabilities.  An  additional  federal  statute  pertaining  to  hacking  is  18  USC  §  1030  Sect.  2701 a , referencing  unlawful  access  to  stored  communications.  Given  that  so  much  personal information  is  now  stored  in  email  accounts  hosted  on  web  servers  that  are  protected through limited security protocols, like passwords that can be easily hacked, there is a need  to  protect  this  information  at  all  points.  This  statute  makes  it  an  offense  to intentionally  either   1   access  without  authorization  a  facility  through  which  an electronic  communication  is  provided;  or   2   exceed  an  authorization  to  access  such  a facility  and  then  obtain,  alter,  or  prevent  authorized  access  to  a  wire  or  electronic communication  while  it  is  in  electronic  storage.  This  law  is  designed  to  help  secure personal  communications  and  information,  particularly  against  nation-state  attackers who  may  attempt  to  use  email  or  communications  to  better  understand  a  target  Brenner, 2011 .  Initially, the punishments for these offenses involved a fine and or imprisonment for not  more  than  one  year  for  the  first  offense,  and  up  to  five  years  for  a  subsequent offense. This statute was amended by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to increase the penalties if the offense was completed for “purposes of commercial advantage, malicious  121   destruction or damage, or private commercial gain, or in furtherance of any criminal or tortuous act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or any State”  Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, 2002 . If the attacks occurs for these reasons, an actor may receive a fine and up to five years in prison for the first offense, and then up to ten years’ imprisonment for multiple offenses.  In addition to federal statutes, all states have laws against computer hacking in some shape or form  Brenner, 2011 . In fact, the first state to pass a law related to hacking was Florida in 1978, with the creation of the Computer Crimes Act. Although each state is different, they largely define hacking in one of two ways:  1.  unauthorized access to computers or computer systems; 2.  unauthorized access leading to the acquisition, theft, deletion, or corruption of  data.  The terminology used to define hacking is varied, ranging from “unauthorized access” to “computer  trespass”  to  “computer  tampering.”  In  addition,  some  states  place  computer hacking laws under existing criminal statutes pertaining to burglary, theft, and robbery  Brenner,  2011 .  For  instance,  Missouri  defines  computer  hacking  as  “tampering”  with either computers or data and has placed these offenses under Chapter 569, which include “Robbery, Burglary, and Related Offenses.” Others, like North Carolina, place computer hacking  and  related  cybercrimes  under  their  own  statutes  in  order  to  encapsulate  the unique nature of cybercrimes  Brenner, 2011 . Regardless of the term used, many states consider  unauthorized  access  on  its  own  as  a  misdemeanor,  while  access  and manipulation of data is typically defined as a felony.  To learn more about the incident that spawned the first state-level computer crime law in the US, go online to: http:  repository.jmls.edu cgi viewcontent.cgi? article=1414&context=jitpl .  Similar  legislation  is  present  in  countries  around  the  world,  though  there  are  some variations  in  the  way  in  which  these  statutes  can  be  applied  or  the  punishments associated with the offense. For instance, the UK Computer Misuse Act of 1990 defines three behaviors as offenses:  122   1.  unauthorized access to computer material  whether data or a program ; 2.  unauthorized access to a computer system with intent to commit or facilitate  the commission of a serious crime;  3.  unauthorized modification of computer material.  The structure of this Act recognizes variations in the way in which hackers operate, such as the fact that only some hackers may attempt to gain access to systems, while others may  attempt  to  maliciously  use  or  modify  data.  Any  individual  found  guilty  of  a violation  of  the  first  statute  can  face  a  maximum  sentence  of  six  months  or  a  fine  of £2,000, or both. Subsequent charges under the second and third statutes are associated with more severe sanctions, including up to five years in prison, a fine, or both.  Several researchers hold this legislation up as a model for other nations because of its applicability  to  various  forms  of  hacking  and  compromise   see  Brenner,  2011;  Furnell, 2002 .  The  law  itself,  however,  emerged  because  of  the  absence  of  existing  laws  that could be used to prosecute the crimes performed by Robert Schifreen and Steven Gold in 1984  and  1985.  Specifically,  Schifreen  noticed  the  username  and  password  of  a  system engineer at the British Telecom firm Prestel, and he and Gold used this information to access  various  parts  of  the  network  and  gain  access  to  sensitive  account  information  Furnell,  2002 .  The  two  were  then  caught  by  Prestel  administrators  and  arrested,  but there was no legislation against the activities they performed. Thus, prosecutors charged the pair under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act of 1981, under the auspices that they had “forged” the user credentials of others  Furnell, 2002 .  Although  both  Schifreen  and  Gold  were  found  guilty,  they  appealed  their  case, claiming that they had caused no actual harm and had been charged under inappropriate statutes   Furnell,  2002 .  The  two  were  acquitted  based  on  the  conclusion  that  forgery laws were misapplied and their actions were not, in fact, a violation of existing criminal law.  As  a  result,  the  English  Law  Commission  recommended  that  new  legislation  be developed  to  criminalize  various  forms  of  hacking   Furnell,  2002 .  The  law  was introduced and passed in 1990, though subsequent revisions have been introduced over the past 25 years to increase sanctions, apply the law to offenses involving smart phones, and cover offenses involving malicious software  Brenner, 2011; Furnell, 2002 .  Other  nations  define  hacking  more  narrowly,  as  with  the  Indian  Information Technology Act, 2000, which specifically criminalizes and references a hack as a person who  “destroys  or  deletes  or  alters  any  information  residing  in  a  computer  resource  or diminishes  its  value  or  utility  or  affects  it  injuriously  by  any  means”   Department  of Electronics  and  Information  Technology,  2008 .  Engaging  in  such  an  act  can  lead  to  a fine  of  up  to  500,000  rupees  and or  up  to  three  years’  imprisonment.  There  are  other subsections  of  the  hacking  law  related  to   1   receiving  a  stolen  computer  or communications device,  2  using a fraudulently obtained password, digital signature, or other unique identification, and  3  cheating using a computer resource  Department of Electronics and Information Technology, 2008 . While cheating is not specifically defined within  the  law,  this  is  a  unique  addition  that  is  largely  absent  from  other  nations’  123   criminal codes. These subsections recognize the role of hacking as a facilitator for other criminal acts, extending the utility of the law in a similar fashion to the US CFAA.  At  a  broader  level,  the  Convention  on  Cybercrime   CoC ,  also  known  as  the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, is the first international treaty designed to address cybercrime  and  synchronize  national  laws  on  these  offenses   Weismann,  2011 .  This Convention  was  developed  in  conjunction  with  the  Council  of  Europe,  Canada,  and Japan  in  2001,  and  came  into  force  in  2004.  The  language  of  the  treaty  specifically addresses a number of cybercrimes  illegal access, illegal interceptions, data interference, system  interference,  misuse  of  devices,  computer-related  forgery,  computer-related fraud,  child  pornography,  and  copyright  infringements ,  with  the  intent  to  create common criminal policies and encourage international cooperation in the investigation and  prosecution  of  these  offenses.  The  CoC  does  not,  however,  encourage  extradition, which limits its value in enforcement. In addition, those states that sign and ratify the CoC are under no obligation to accept all parameters of the Convention. Instead they can select which provisions they choose to enforce, further limiting its utility. Some of the primary offenses detailed in the Convention include illegal access and illegal interception of  data  and  communications,  as  well  as  data  interference,  system  interference,  and misuse  of  devices   Weismann,  2011 .  Thus,  the  CoC  has  inherent  value  for  the development of consistent legal frameworks and definitions for hacking-related crimes in a global context  Weismann, 2011 .  At present, 50 nations have ratified the treaty and another five have signed but not ratified  the  Convention.  The  majority  of  the  ratifiers  are  members  of  the  Council  of Europe and European Union generally, including Italy, Germany, Turkey, the Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Several nations that are not members of the Council have also ratified  the  CoC,  including  Australia,  Canada,  Dominican  Republic,  Israel,  Japan, Mauritius,  Panama,  Sri  Lanka,  and  the  United  States.  The  language  of  the  CoC  has served as a model for a number of nations’ cybercrime laws, particularly in a number of South  American  and  African  nations   Riquert,  2013;  Weismann,  2011 .  Thus,  the Convention on Cybercrime may be invaluable in structuring consistent laws regarding cybercrime.  124   Enforcing and investigating hacker activity  It is important to note that federal agencies are responsible for cases where the victim and offender reside in different states or countries. We will focus our discussion on the primary  federal  agencies  responsible  for  the  investigation  of  computer  hacking,  since there  are  few  local  law  enforcement  agencies  investigating  computer  hacking.  This appears  to  stem  from  the  fact  that  these  cases  are  often  very  technically  complex.  In addition,  these  crimes  involve  local  victims  compromised  by  offenders  living  in completely  separate  jurisdictions  that  cannot  be  affected  by  a  police  or  sheriff’s  office  Holt, Burruss, and Bossler, 2015 .  One  of  the  most  prominent  federal  law  enforcement  bodies  involved  in  the investigation  of  hacking  cases  is  the  United  States  Secret  Service   USSS .  The  Secret Service was initially part of the Department of the Treasury, dating back to its creation in 1865 in order to combat the production and use of counterfeit currency following the Civil  War   USSS,  2017 .  Now,  however,  the  Secret  Service  is  housed  under  the Department  of  Homeland  Security   DHS .  The  Secret  Service  was  initially  tasked  with hacking cases through the CFAA because of their mandate to investigate crimes against financial  institutions  and  counterfeit  currency   18  USC  §  1030 .  The  growth  of technology and Internet connectivity among banks and financial service providers made the Secret Service seem like an experienced agency, capable of investigating hacking and online fraud.  Today, the Secret Service investigates cybercrimes through its Criminal Investigative Division, specifically through its Financial Crimes Unit with three primary investigative responsibilities  concerning  cybercrime   USSS,  2017 .  The  first  involves  financial institution fraud  FIF  against banks, savings and loan institutions, and credit unions  see Chapter 6 for additional details . The second includes access device fraud, such as the use of  passwords  in  order  to  engage  in  fraud  or  hacks  against  various  targets.  The  final responsibility  involves  acts  of  fraud  that  affect  computers  of  “federal  interest,”  that directly  facilitate  interstate  or  international  commerce  and  government  information transfers.  The  US  Secret  Service  also  has  two  task  forces  that  investigate  cyber-intrusions: Electronic  Crimes  Task  Forces  and  Financial  Crimes  Task  Forces.  The  Secret  Service operates 39 Electronic Crimes Task Forces that use the resources of academia, the private sector, and law enforcement at all levels to meet Congressional mandate for the Secret Service  to  create  a  national  network  to  “prevent,  detect,  and  investigate  electronic crimes,  including  potential  terrorist  attacks  against  critical  infrastructure  and  financial payment  systems”   USSS,  2017 .  The  Secret  Service  also  operates  46  Financial  Crimes Task Forces that “combine the resources of the private sector and other law enforcement agencies in an organized effort to combat threats to U.S. financial payment systems and  125   critical infrastructure”  USSS, 2017 .  The  other  prominent  agency  involved  in  the  investigation  of  hacking  cases  is  the Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation   FBI .  Cybercrime  is  one  of  the  FBI’s  top  three investigative priorities, in part by legal mandate in the CFAA. The law stipulates that the FBI  has  the  primary  authority  to  investigate  hacking  cases  that  involve  espionage, foreign  nation-states,  counterintelligence,  and  classified  sensitive  data  that  affects national defense or foreign relations.  In  order  to  address  that  mandate,  the  FBI  has  established  several  capabilities  and partnerships. The FBI operates a Cyber Division at its headquarters to coordinate their cyber  strategy.  They  also  run  93  Computer  Crimes  Task  Forces  that  can  investigate cybercrimes  and  work  with  other  law  enforcement  agencies  at  the  local,  state,  and federal levels  FBI, 2017a . These task forces are focused on investigating attacks against critical infrastructure, hacks that target private industry or financial systems, and other cybercrimes.  The  CTFs  in  each  region  are  also  responsible  for  developing  and maintaining relationships with public and private industry partners in order to improve their response capabilities  FBI, 2017a .  For more information on the FBI, go online to: www.fbi.gov investigate cyber.  The FBI also operates the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force  NCIJTF  in  partnership  with  the Department  of  Defense  Cyber  Crime  Center   DoD  DC3 ,  a specialized  agency  run  by  the  Air  Force  to  perform  forensic  analyses  and  training  for attacks  against  DoD  computers  and  defense  contractors,  referred  to  as  the  Defense Industrial  Base   DIB    DC3,  2017 .  The  NCIJTF  was  created  in  2008  by  presidential mandate in order to serve as the coordinating response agency for all domestic cyber- threat  investigations.  This  group  is  not  focused  on  reducing  vulnerabilities,  but  rather pursuing  the  actors  responsible  for  various  attacks   FBI,  2017b .  In  addition,  their domestic  focus  does  not  mean  they  are  centered  only  on  US-based  actors,  but  also  on any  individual  interested  in  attacking  the  nation’s  infrastructure.  In  fact,  the  NCI-JTF coordinates with each CTF in order to provide investigative resources and assistance to facilitate their mission  FBI, 2017b .  The Bureau also operates Cyber Action Teams  CATs , which are highly trained small groups  of  agents,  analysts,  and  forensic  investigators  who  can  respond  to  incidents around  the  world.  These  teams  are  designed  to  collect  data  and  serve  as  rapid  first  126   responders to any incident, no matter where it occurs around the world. In addition, the FBI  serves  as  the  coordinating  agency  for  the  global  Strategic  Alliance  Cyber  Crime Working  Group.  This  international  partnership  includes  the  Australian  Federal  Police, Royal  Canadian  Mounted  Police   RCMP ,  New  Zealand  Police,  and  the  UK’s  National Crime  Agency.  This  five-way  partnership  is  designed  to  facilitate  investigations,  share intelligence  on  threats,  and  synchronize  laws  in  order  to  promote  more  successful partnerships  against  both  organized  criminal  groups  and  cybercrimes.  In  fact,  this partnership  has  led  to  a  shared  Internet  portal  designed  to  share  information  among these countries, joint international task forces, and shared training programs in order to standardize investigative techniques and training  FBI, 2017a .  To  see  the  global  scope  of  the  FBI’s  Working  Group,  go  online  to: www.fbi.gov news stories 2008 march cybergroup_031708.  In  addition,  the  FBI  operates  the  InfraGard  project,  a  non-profit  public–  private partnership  designed  to  facilitate  information  sharing  among  academics,  industry,  and law  enforcement   InfraGard,  2017 .  The  group  is  designed  to  aid  in  collaborations  in order  to  better  protect  critical  infrastructure  and  reduce  attacks  against  US  resources. InfraGard operates in chapters across the USA, which hold regular meetings to discuss threats and issues of interest with members. InfraGard has 84 chapters and over 54,000 members,  all  of  whom  must  go  through  a  vetting  process  in  order  to  participate  InfraGard,  2017 .  In  turn,  members  gain  access  to  a  secured  web  portal  where intelligence  on  threats,  vulnerabilities,  and  general  information  is  shared.  This partnership  has  been  very  successful,  though  members  of  the  hacker  group  LulzSec attacked InfraGard chapter websites in order to embarrass the FBI  see Satter, 2011; also Box 3.7 for more details . This attack, however, appears to be an isolated incident in the otherwise positive partnerships afforded by InfraGard.  127   Box 3.7 LulzSec hacks FBI affiliate, Infragard  www.digitaltrends.com computing lulzsec-hacks-fbi-affiliate-infragard .  Nearly 180 passwords belonging to members of an Atlanta-based FBI affiliate have been stolen and leaked to the Internet, the group confirmed Sunday. [.] Copies of the passwords [.] were posted to the Internet by online hacking collective Lulz Security, which has claimed credit for a string of attacks in the past week.  This  article  provides  an  overview  of  the  hacks  performed  by  the  Anonymous offshoot hacking group LulzSec against Infragard. In addition, the article illustrates some of the tensions between Anonymous and security specialists.  While the FBI and Secret Service focus on the investigation of cybercrimes, they must work in close concert with the United States Attorney’s Office, which is a part of the US Department  of  Justice   DOJ   focused  on  the  prosecution  of  federal  criminal  cases. Although  the  FBI  is  part  of  the  DOJ,  they  operate  as  an  investigative  arm,  while  the Attorney’s  Office  represents  the  federal  government  in  court  to  prosecute  suspects.  In fact,  the  investigation  of  cybercrimes  is  largely  handled  by  the  Criminal  Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section  CCIPS . Initially, violations of the CFAA  were  prosecuted  at  the  federal  level  through  the  Computer  Crime  Unit,  first established in 1991  US DOJ, 2017 . The expansion of the Internet and the resulting range of cybercrimes that became possible led to a restructuring of the unit to a full Section with  the  enactment  of  the  National  Information  and  Infrastructure  Protection  Act  of 1996.  The  unit  now  deals  exclusively  with  the  investigation  and  prosecution  of cybercrime cases and intellectual property crimes, through close collaboration with law enforcement agencies and private industry. The CCIPS division also provides support for prosecutors handling similar cases at the federal, state, and local levels, and works with legislators to develop new policies and legal statutes to deal with cybercrime generally. Recently,  the  Criminal  division  created  the  Cybersecurity  Unit  within  the  Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section “to serve as a central hub for expert advice and legal  guidance  regarding  how  the  criminal  electronic  surveillance  and  computer  fraud and abuse statutes impact cybersecurity”  US DOJ, 2017 .  For more information on the DOJ’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, go online to: www.justice.gov criminal-ccips about-ccips.  128   In addition, there is now a Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property  CHIP  Unit within the DOJ which first appeared in the Northern District of California in 2000  US DOJ,  2015 .  The  section  was  established  in  order  to  provide  prosecutors  to  handle cybercrime cases related to the massive technology industries operating in Silicon Valley, California.  This  unit  was  almost  immediately  successful  and  was  involved  in prosecutions related to economic espionage, piracy cases, spam, and other hacking cases. The success of this unit has led to its replication across the country with more than 260 operating  prosecutors,  including  one  in  each  of  the  94  US  attorney’s  offices   US  DOJ, 2015 .  In  addition,  there  are  25  CHIP  units  across  the  country,  with  representation  in most regions in the USA, though the majority are in California, Texas, Florida, Virginia, and most states on the northeastern seaboard.  Specialized  law  enforcement  agencies  also  operate  around  the  world  to  investigate cybercrimes  that  may  violate  local  or  federal  laws.  For  example,  the  National Crime Agency’s   NCA   National  Cyber  Crime  Unit   NCCU   is  responsible  for  leading  the United  Kingdom’s  response  to  serious  forms  of  cybercrime,  provide  cyber-specialist support, and to coordinate the nation’s cyber-response with Regional Organized Crime Units,  the  Metropolitan  Police  Cyber  Crime  Unit,  industry,  and  international  law enforcement agencies. As part of this coordination, they share intelligence and expertise to increase the knowledge of cyber-threat in order to more effectively disrupt cybercrime activity. Thus this unit serves a similar role to that of the FBI in the response to serious cybercrimes   NCA,  2017 .  Similar  structures  are  present  in  the  Korean  National  Police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police through their Integrated Technological Crime Unit  Andress and Winterfeld, 2011 .  129   Summary  The computer hacker subculture is distinctive and provides justifications for individuals to develop a deep understanding of technology and the ability to apply their knowledge in  innovative  ways.  Some  hackers  use  their  skills  for  malicious  purposes,  while  others use them to protect computer systems. Both ethical and malicious hackers may have to use the same skill sets to complete an activity. In fact, hackers judge one another on the basis  of  their  skills,  connection  to  technology,  and  depth  of  knowledge.  Those  with demonstrable skills garner more respect from their peers, while those with minimal skills may be derided by others.  The  perception  of  hackers  as  malicious  actors  stems  directly  from  the  evolution  of hacking  and  technology.  The  criminalization  of  hacking  in  the  late  1970s  and  1980s, coupled  with  the  development  of  the  personal  computer,  enabled  a  shift  in  the  hacker subculture  and  the  expansion  of  hacking  to  new  populations.  As  technology  became more user friendly, the hacker culture changed, creating significant variations in the skill and ability of hackers. These factors have produced the current population of skilled and semi-skilled  hackers  with  various  motives  and  ethical  orientations.  Thus,  there  is  no single  way  to  deal  with  hackers  who  use  their  skills  for  criminal  gain.  Instead,  it  is critical to understand that script kiddies and noobs present a different threat than those black-hat hackers who can successfully penetrate systems without detection.

Think about the various ways in which you have seen hackers portrayed in popular media over the past few years. Are they heroic characters or dangerous  criminals?  Do  the  representations  conform  to  any  of  the  131   realities of the hacker subculture, or do they simply further stereotypes about hackers as a whole?  2.  If  hacking  is  a  skill  or  ability,  does  it  share  any  similarities  with  other  real-world activities that may be applied in malicious or ethical ways?  3.  Compare  the  ideas  expressed  in  the  hacker  ethic  with  the  comments made  by  the  Mentor  in  The  Hacker  Manifesto.  Do  they  make  similar points,  or  are  they  very  different  documents?  If  there  are  common themes, what do they suggest about hacking and the complexities of the hacker subculture?  4.  Given the range of actors evident in the hacker subculture, is it possible that ethical and unethical hackers may share similar motives? If so, what might  those  motives  be,  and  is  it  possible  to  identify  an  individual’s ethical stance based solely on their motives?  5.  What were the weaknesses of using “traditional” legislation to prosecute  hackers? How did newer legislation address those problems?  132   References  18 USC § 1030. 2600.  2011 . 2600: The Hacker Quarterly. Available at: www.2600.com . Andress, J., and Winterfeld, S.  2011 .

Many in the general public have heard the term “virus” or perhaps “Trojan” in computing,  though  they  may  neither  understand  what  they  actually  do  nor  how  they operate.  The  lack  of  understanding  is  compounded  by  the  number  of  security  tools available to protect computer systems from malware. Although most laptops and desktop computers are sold with some form of antivirus software pre-installed, owners may not know how, when, or why to properly use these tools. In addition, most mobile phones and tablet computers, such as iPads or Kindles, do not have this software, even though they can be infected by malware.  Computer  users  who  understand  the  value  and  necessity  of  antivirus  software  and security tools to minimize the likelihood of infections may not realize that they are still vulnerable  to  attacks  from  new  code  that  has  just  been  identified.  Although  that  may seem like a relatively minor dilemma, consider that there were at least 431 million new pieces  of  malware  identified  in  2015,  a  36  percent  increase  from  the  previous  year  Symantec,  2016 !  In  addition,  the  behavior  of  malware  can  often  be  so  subtle  that  an individual may not know that they have been affected.  examples   to: For  www.foxbusiness.com politics 2013 08 07 cyber-hackers-on-course-for-one-million- malware-apps.html  and  malware,   vulnerabilities   online   go   of   This chapter is designed to provide a basic understanding of malware, including the most  common  forms  of  malware  that  are  active  in  the  wild.  Due  to  the  substantive technical  details  involved  in  the  classification  and  operation  of  malware,  this  chapter will provide descriptions of each form without going into overly technical explorations of  their  functionality.  Instead,  a  summary  description  will  be  provided  using  minimal technical jargon in order to give readers a basic appreciation for the range of malware currently operating, its role in attacks, and any historical evolution of these tools in the  139   hacker  and  computer  security  community  generally.  Visual  examples  of  the  user interfaces associated with malware will also be provided to demonstrate the ease with which some tools can be used. The legal frameworks used to prosecute malware-related cybercrimes  and  their  relationship  to  hacking  will  also  be  discussed.  Finally,  we  will consider  the  legal  and  computer  security  entities  operating  to  protect  users  from malware threats.  140   The basics of malware  Malicious software,  or malware,  is  largely  an  umbrella  term  used  to  encapsulate  the range of destructive programs that can be used to harm computer systems, gain access to sensitive information, or engage in different forms of cybercrime. Malware can serve a countless number of different functions, but are generally designed to automate attacks against systems and simplify the process of hacking overall. Various forms of malware have increased in complexity, in keeping with the evolution of technology over the past two  decades   BitDefender,  2009;  Symantec,  2016 .  Malware,  however,  exists  in  a nebulous  legal  space,  as  there  are  no  specific  laws  against  the  creation  of  malicious software   Brenner,  2011 .  It  is  simply  computer  code,  which  writers  will  argue  is necessary in order to better understand the limits of computer and network security. The use of these tools in or to access computers without permission from the system owner is, however, illegal. Thus, individuals who write malicious code may have minimal legal culpability for the way that others use their creations so long as they are not the ones utilizing it on networks without authorization  Brenner, 2011 .  Malicious  software  programs  operate  by  exploiting  vulnerabilities,  or  flaws,  in computer  software  or  hardware   Symantec,  2016 .  Every  program  has  design  flaws. There  are  literally  thousands  of  vulnerabilities  that  have  been  identified  in  systems which individuals use every day, such as Microsoft Windows and popular web browsers. In  fact,  Symantec   2016   identified  5,585  new  vulnerabilities  in  2015  alone,  which  was actually  a  decrease  from  the  6,549  identified  in  2014.  The  presence  of  a  vulnerability allows an attacker to understand and gain initial access to a target system in some way. Many  security  professionals  attempt  to  identify  vulnerabilities  in  order  to  help  secure computer  systems,  though  this  information  is  typically  released  to  the  public  through open  forums  or  email  lists  like  BugTraq   see  Box  4.1;  also  Taylor,  1999 .  As  a  result, attackers can immediately use information on vulnerabilities to their advantage.  Box 4.1 The debate over public or private vulnerability  disclosures  141   http:  web.archive.org web 20100102144837 http:  spirit.com Network net0800.html.  Vulnerability disclosure debate  Today,  there  are  appeals  to  put  the  genie  back  into  the  bottle.  That  is,  to  stop  the  publishing  of  new vulnerabilities. There is even a proposed law that would make some forms of vulnerability testing illegal in the US.  This article provides an interesting debate on the issue of vulnerability disclosures and  the  relationship  between  black-hat  and  white-hat  hackers  who  identify  and provide this information to the public for free, or to companies and security vendors for a profit. This work helps give context to the difficult need to balance privacy and free information exchange in the security community.  Once a vulnerability is identified, malware writers then create an exploit, or a piece of code, that can take advantage of vulnerabilities to give the attacker deeper access to a system  or  network   Symantec,  2016 .  These  exploits  are  often  built  into  malware  to compromise and influence the victim machine more efficiently. The changes that a piece of  malware  causes  to  a  computer  system  are  affected  by  what  is  commonly  called  its payload. When a piece of malware is activated and executes the program it contains, the resulting impact on the system can range from benign to highly destructive, depending primarily on the skills of the writer and their interests. In fact, early malware typically caused  no  actual  harm  to  the  system  or  its  contents,  but  annoyed  the  victim  by presenting  them  with  messages  or  playing  music  at  a  high  volume.  Many  variants  of malware today often delete or change system files, causing harm to the user’s documents and files, or collect information that users input or store on their system, causing a loss of  personally  identifiable  information.  Some  malware  can  even  disrupt  the  basic functions of an operating system, thereby rendering a computer unusable.  Malware  is  generally  used  to  disrupt  email  and  network  operations,  access  private files,  steal  sensitive  information,  delete  or  corrupt  files,  or  generally  damage  computer software and hardware  Kaspersky, 2003; Nazario, 2003; Symantec, 2016 . As a result, the dissemination of malware across computer networks can be costly for several reasons, including,  but  not  limited  to:   1   the  loss  of  data  and  copyrighted  information;   2  identity  theft;   3   loss  of  revenue  due  to  customer  apprehension  about  the  safety  of  a company’s  website;   4   time  spent  removing  the  programs;  and   5   losses  in  personal productivity  and  system  functions.  The  interconnected  nature  of  modern  computer networks and the Internet of Things  IoT  also allows an infected system in one country to  spread  malicious  software  across  the  globe  and  cause  even  greater  damage.  Thus, malware infection poses a significant threat to Internet users around the globe.  142   Viruses, trojans, and worms  Malicious  software  is  a  problem  that  many  individuals  in  the  general  public  with minimal technical proficiency do not understand. Part of the confusion lies in identifying the  diverse  range  of  current  malware.  The  most  common  forms  of  malware  include computer  viruses,  worms,  and  trojan  horse  programs  that  alter  functions  within computer  programs  and  files.  These  programs  have  some  distinctive  features  that separate them from one another, though more recent forms of malware combine aspects of these programs to create what are commonly called blended threats. We will explore the most common forms of malware here and differentiate them based on their unique features and utility in an attack.  Viruses  Viruses  are  perhaps  the  oldest  form  of  malware,  operating  since  the  earliest  days  of computing  Szor, 2005 . This form of malware can neither be activated nor execute its payload  without  some  user  intervention,  such  as  opening  a  file  or  clicking  on  an attachment. The target must execute the code in some fashion so that the virus will be installed in either existing programs, data files, or the boot sector of a hard drive  Szor, 2005 . In addition, many viruses may access sensitive data, corrupt files, steal space on the hard drive, or generally disrupt system processes.  Viruses can install themselves in data files or existing programs and operate based on the  parameters  of  a  specific  operating  system,  whether  Windows,  Linux,  or  Mac  OS. These  viruses  will  attempt  to  install  themselves  in  any  executable  file  so  as  to  ensure their success. Some viruses can overwrite the contents of their target file with malicious code which renders the original file unusable. Such a tactic is, however, easy to identify because the error or failure that results may be immediately obvious to the user. Other viruses can insert their code into the file, but leave it operational so that it will not be identified  by  the  user.  Finally,  some  viruses  can  clone  an  existing  file  so  that  it  runs instead of the original program  Szor, 2005 .  Boot sector viruses operate by attempting to install their code into the boot sector of either  a  form  of  storage  media  like  a  flash  drive  or  into  the  hard  disk  of  the  targeted computer  Szor, 2005 . A boot sector is a region of any sort of storage media or the hard disk  of  a  computer  that  can  hold  code  which  is  loaded  into  memory  by  a  computer’s firmware.  There  are  a  range  of  boot  sectors,  but  the  operating  system  loader  of  most devices is stored starting in the first boot sector so that it is the first thing that the system loads. As a result, virus writers create boot sector viruses so that they can load the code of their virus into the Random Access Memory  RAM  of the computer. This ensures that  143   the virus will always be present in the system from the start to finish of each session. In fact, a boot virus can gain control of the entire system by installing itself in a specific region and then changing the boot record so that the original code is no longer in control of the system. The malware then becomes extremely difficult to identify and eradicate, and can severely impact the functionality of the system  Szor, 2005 .  Some of the first viruses observed in the home PC market during the 1980s were boot sector viruses that spread to other machines via floppy disks. These viruses generally had limited functionality and malicious utility. For example, they might often play music or delete  letters  in  documents.  For  instance,  one  of  the  first  viruses  observed  in  home computers was called Elk Cloner and was designed to infect Apple II computers via a floppy disk  Manjoo, 2007 . The code was written as a prank by Rich Skrenta, a 15-year- old boy who liked to play and share computer games. He wrote Elk Cloner in order to play a practical joke on his friends without clueing them in to the presence of the code  Manjoo, 2007 . The virus was attached to a game which when played 50 times would display the following poem:  Elk Cloner: The program with a personality  It will get on all your disks  It will infiltrate your chips  Yes, it’s Cloner!  It will stick to you like glue  It will modify RAM too  Send in the Cloner!  Although  the  program  caused  no  actual  harm,  the  code  was  difficult  to  remove  and infected  many  machines  because  the  virus  would  install  locally  on  any  computer  and then infect other floppy disks inserted into the infected system  Manjoo, 2007 .  Macro viruses are also a popular way to infect systems by using a common weakness in a variety of popular programs like Excel, Word, and PDFs  Szor, 2005; F-Secure, 2017 . Virus writers can write a program using the macro programming languages associated with  specific  applications  and  embed  the  code  into  the  appropriate  file,  such  as  a PowerPoint  presentation.  Opening  the  file  actually  executes  the  virus,  enabling  the infection payload to be activated and subsequently embed the code into other documents of  the  same  type  so  that  any  attempt  to  share  a  file  will  lead  to  other  systems  being infected.  Macro  viruses  designed  to  target  Microsoft  Outlook  can  infect  a  user’s computer by including infected files, or even by the user previewing an infected email.  In  the  early  1990s,  virus  writers  began  to  employ  encryption  protocols  in  order  to make  the  code  more  difficult  to  detect  and  remove   Szor,  2005 .  This  novel  tactic  was further  adapted  through  the  development  of  MuTation  Engine   MtE   in  1991,  a polymorphic  generator  that  not  only  encrypted  the  virus  but  randomized  the  routine used  so  that  it  varied  with  each  replication.  The  term  “polymorphic”  references  the ability  to  assume  multiple  forms  or  go  through  various  phases.  In  the  context  of malware, this term references the use of code to hide viruses from detection by changing their  structure  in  order  to  not  match  existing  signatures.  Thus,  the  emergence  of  144   polymorphic  engines  led  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of  these  viruses  in  the  wild  in 1993.  For  a  deeper  explanation  of  polymorphic  engines  in  malware,  go  online  to: www.dailymotion.com video xcetxj_avg-tutorials-what-ispolymorphic-v_tech.  During  this  period,  the  Microsoft  Windows  operating  system  emerged  and  became tremendously popular among home computer users for its easy use and various features. As  a  result,  virus  writers  began  to  target  Windows  users  and  incorporated  the  use  of macros in order to compromise the system. The first macro virus, called Concept, was found  in  1995   see  Box  4.2  for  more  details;  Paquette,  2010 .  This  code  would  only replicate itself and displayed the following message: “That’s enough to prove my point.” This was not necessarily malicious, but demonstrated that macros were a weakness that could be exploited. As a result, a number of macro-based viruses were released, affecting both  Windows  and  Mac  OS  computers,  since  both  operating  systems  could  run  the Microsoft Office software suite  Paquette, 2010 . This common business-based software includes Excel and Word, which could both be easily affected by macro-based viruses as they support a macro programming language.  Box 4.2 F-Secure report on virus W32 Concept malware  www.f-secure.com v-descs concept.shtml.  Virus W32 Concept  145   The  virus  gets  executed  every  time  an  infected  document  is  opened.  It  tries  to  infect  Word’s  global document template, NORMAL.DOT  which is also capable of holding macros . If it finds either the macro “PayLoad” or “FileSaveAs” already on the template, it assumes that the template is already infected.  This technical brief provides an in-depth analysis of how a macro virus operates in a Windows system, including a breakdown of how it infects programs overall.  Around  the  same  time,  viruses  began  to  spread  through  the  Internet  as  the  World Wide Web was becoming popular among home users and more easily accessible through an increase in Internet service providers. In fact, one of the most prominent viruses of this  period,  the  Melissa virus,  which  was  first  identified  in  1999,  spread  through  the Web and used macros to infect users’ computers  F-Secure, 2014 . The Melissa virus was distributed through an online discussion group titled alt.sex by sending an infected file entitled “List.DOC” which contained passwords for pornographic websites. Anyone who opened  the  file  using  Microsoft  Word  97  or  2000  was  infected.  The  macro  code  then attempted to email itself out to 50 people using the email client in Microsoft Outlook  F- Secure, 2014 . Given that it would send 50 emails per infected system, the infection rate was quite substantial. In addition, the code altered the Word program to infect any new document created.  The virus payload was not necessarily harmful in that it did not delete files or corrupt systems, but it clogged email servers because of its distribution pattern. In the end, it was estimated that approximately 1.2 million computers were infected in the USA with $80 million  in  damages  worldwide  due  to  system  outages  and  the  costs  to  remove  the malware   Szor,  2005 .  Based  on  the  success  of  the  Melissa  virus  and  others,  malware writers quickly began to adopt the Web as a means to spread their code as widely and as easily as possible. They not only targeted common OS products like Microsoft Office, but also programming languages commonly used in web-browsing software and tools such as Java.  Trojans  In addition to viruses, trojans are a prevalent form of malware. This form of malware is similar  to  viruses  in  that  it  cannot  replicate  on  its  own,  but  requires  some  user interaction in order to execute the code. It got its name from the Trojan horse of ancient Greece, which was a giant wooden horse concealing soldiers inside  Dunham, 2008 . The horse  was  brought  inside  fortified  city  walls  under  the  belief  that  it  was  a  gift;  this enabled the warriors to sack the city. Computer-based trojans share a similar structure in that they appear to be a downloadable file or attachment that people would be inclined to open, such as photos, videos, or documents with misleading titles such as “XXX Porn” or  “Receipt  of  Purchase”   Dunham,  2008 .  When  the  file  is  opened,  it  executes  some portion of its code and delivers its payload on the system. Thus, trojan writers use social engineering principles in order to entice users to open their files  see Chapter 3 for more  146   details .  Trojans  do  not  typically  replicate  themselves  on  the  infected  system  or  attempt  to propagate across systems. Instead, trojans most often serve to establish back doors that can  be  used  to  gain  continuous  unauthorized  access  to  an  infected  system   Dunham, 2008 .  Specifically,  the  code  can  open  ports  and  establish  remote  controls  between  the infected  system  and  the  operator’s  computer,  allowing  them  to  invisibly  execute commands  on  that  system.  This  is  achieved  through  the  use  of  a  client  and  server system, where the victim executes the trojan and establishes a server on their computer that can be remotely accessed by a client program on the attacker’s computer  Dunham, 2008 .  The  commands  sent  between  the  client  and  server  are  largely  invisible  to  the infected user, though if the attacker uses too much of the available processing power it may slow down the infected system.  The benefit of trojan programs to an attacker are that they can configure the tool to perform a range of functions, including keystroke logging, access to sensitive files, use of the  webcam  or  other  system  tools,  use  of  the  infected  system  as  a  launch  point  for attacks against other systems, and even send additional forms of malware to the system to  engage  in  secondary  infections.  Many  trojans  also  allow  the  attacker  to  restart  a computer remotely and manage its activities without the victim’s knowledge. Some even give  the  attacker  the  power  to  uninstall  or  deactivate  security  tools  and  firewalls, rendering the system unable to protect itself from harm  Dunham, 2008 .  One of the more noteworthy trojans that combined all of these functions into a single tool was called Sub7 or Subseven, a piece of malware initially written by a hacker called Mobman   Crapanzano,  2003 .  The  program  functions  on  virtually  all  variations  of  the Windows  operating  system  and  acts  as  a  sort  of  remote  control  program  in  that  the attacker can remotely command the system to perform a variety of functions. To achieve this, the program has three components: the server, client, and server editor. The server portion  runs  on  the  victim  machine,  enabling  the  client  machine,  operated  by  an attacker, to use the system remotely. The server editor allows the attacker to define the operating functions and utilities of the infection, making it possible for the attacker to have clear control over their victim  Crapanzano, 2003 .  Sub7 has a range of functions, including giving the attacker remote access to system files,  the  ability  to  control  the  system  camera  and  microphone,  access  to  cached passwords,  and  the  ability  to  change  desktop  colors,  open  disk  drives,  and  capture sensitive data  see Figure 4.1 for an example of the attacker interface; also Crapanzano, 2003 .  In  addition,  the  server  editor  function  allows  the  attacker  to  receive  email  or instant message alerts when their victim system is online for more careful management. It is also very easy to attempt to infect user systems, as Sub7 can be sent via email or other attachments. These factors may account for the popularity of Sub7 among hackers, particularly script kiddies  see Chapter 3 for details on script kiddies .  147   Fig. 4.1 The SubSeven Attacker Graphical User Interface  GUI   For more information on Sub7 attacks in the wild, go online to:  1.  www.symantec.com security_response writeup.jsp?docid=2001-020114-  5445-99, and  2.  www.cert.org historical incident_notes IN-2001-07.cfm.  148   The  utility  of  trojans  has  led  them  to  become  one  of  the  most  popular  forms  of malware  available   BitDefender,  2009;  Panda  Security,  2015 .  In  fact,  one  of  the  most dangerous  and  common  trojans  currently  active  today  is  commonly  called  Zeus.  This malware targets Microsoft Windows systems and is often sent through spam messages and  phishing  campaigns  in  which  the  sender  either  sends  attachments  or  directs  the recipient to a link that can infect the user  see Chapter 6 for more details . Once installed, the trojan creates a back door in the system so that it can be remotely controlled. It also affects the web browser in order to capture sensitive data entered by a user  see Figure 4.2  for  an  example  of  Zeus  GUI;  also  Symantec,  2014 .  In  addition,  Zeus  can  collect passwords  stored  locally  on  the  infected  system  and  act  as  a  traditional  keylogging program.  Fig. 4.2 An example of a Zeus Malware Variant GUI  see  Zeus  malware   To  www.trendmicro.com vinfo us threat-encyclopedia web-attack 64 zeus-and-its- continuing-drive-towards-stealing-online-data.  distribution   patterns,   online   go   to:  This  trojan  is  extremely  adaptable  and  has  been  used  as  the  basis  for  a  range  of malware in attacks against various financial institutions across the globe. In fact, a form  149   of Zeus has been identified that infects the Google Android operating systems common on  smart  phones  and  tablets   Leyden,  2012 .  This  malware  acts  as  a  banking  app  that may  be  downloaded  and  installed  on  a  phone  to  capture  SMS  messages  sent  to  bank customers  from  financial  institutions  in  order  to  authenticate  transactions.  The  use  of SMS  messaging  is  common  in  European  banking  in  order  to  authenticate  account information  and  transactions  made  by  a  customer.  Obtaining  this  information  allows attackers  to  engage  in  fraudulent  transfers  between  accounts  and  verify  that  they  are correct  without  the  need  for  victim  interaction.  As  a  result,  a  group  of  cybercriminals was able to obtain 36 million euros from over 30,000 customers in Italy, Germany, Spain, and Holland using this malware  Leyden, 2012 .  A Zeus variant was also used in a series of attacks against hundreds of victims across the USA, leading to losses of over $70 million during 2009  FBI, 2010 . This campaign was operated by multiple individuals living in Eastern Europe, the USA, and the UK. The ring of  thieves  was  disrupted  by  a  multinational  investigation  spearheaded  by  the  Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2010. There were over 100 arrests in this case. The majority of the arrests were in the USA for violations of fraud and money-laundering statutes.  Worms  Worms are a unique form of malware that can spread autonomously, though they do not  necessarily  have  a  payload   Nazario,  2003 .  Instead,  they  use  system  memory  to spread, self-replicate, and deteriorate system functionality. Worms are written as stand- alone programs in that they do not need to attach to existing system files or modify any code. Once activated, it copies itself into the system memory and attempts to spread to other  systems  through  email  address  books  or  other  mechanisms.  Should  an unsuspecting  recipient  click  on  an  attachment  sent  from  a  worm-infected  system,  the code will execute and infect that system, replicating the process.  As  a  result,  worms  can  spread  rapidly  and,  depending  on  their  functionality,  cause massive  network  outages.  For  example,  the Code-Red worm,  activated  online  on  July 13, 2001, began infecting any web server using Microsoft’s IIS web server software. The initial growth of the worm was small, but by July 19 it had exploded and infected more than 359,000 computer systems worldwide within a 14-hour period  CAIDA, 2001 . The infection  rate  was  so  fast  that  it  was  infecting  2,000  hosts  per  minute  during  its  peak spread that day. The sheer number of the worm’s attempts at replication caused a virtual denial-of-service  attack  across  most  of  the  industrialized  world  as  the  worm’s  traffic absorbed almost all available bandwidth.  To  see  a  video  of  the  spread  of  the  Code-Red  worm,  go  online  to: www.caida.org research security code-red coderedv2_analysis.xml.  150   In addition to network degradation, some worms contain secondary payloads to affect computer systems or servers. For instance, the Code-Red worm contained code to display the  following  message  on  any  web  page  hosted  on  a  server  infected  by  the  worm: “HELLO!  Welcome  to  http:  www.worm.com!  Hacked  by  Chinese!”  In  addition,  the worm  contained  a  secondary  payload  to  engage  in  denial-of-service  attacks  against various websites, including the White House. The infected systems, however, seemingly terminated all activities within 28 days, suggesting that there may have been some code within the worm that triggered it to shut down independently  CAIDA, 2001 .  Beyond payloads, it is critical to note that worms can cause tremendous harm on their own  by  crashing  email  servers,  overloading  networks  with  floods  of  requests,  and severely diminishing the functionality of infected systems by forcing them to constantly scan and attempt to replicate the code to other systems  Nazario, 2003 . The first example of a worm in the wild was created by Robert Tappan Morris and became known as the Morris  worm.  The  worm  went  active  on  November  2,  1988  after  being  released  by Morris through a computer at MIT. Morris, a student at Cornell University, claimed he designed the worm to assess the size of the Internet by copying the worm code on each computer  connected  online  at  that  time   Eisenberg,  Gries,  Hartmanis,  Holcomb,  Lynn, and  Santoro,  1989 .  The  code  was  improperly  written  and  malfunctioned,  establishing multiple copies of itself on each system which caused them to slow down dramatically due  to  the  copies  trying  to  replicate  themselves  and  spread  to  other  systems.  Morris’s errors caused an estimated 6,000 UNIX computer systems to be infected multiple times over and become effectively unusable  Eisenberg et al., 1989 .  information   For  more  to: www.welivesecurity.com 2013 11 06 five-interesting-facts-about-the-morris-worm- for-its-25th-anniversary .  the  Morris  worm,   online   on   go   151   Morris  was  prosecuted  and  convicted  in  federal  court  for  violating  the  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Interestingly, Morris was the first person to be convicted under this law. He eventually received three years’ probation, 400 hours of community service, and a substantial fine  Markoff, 1990 .  This incident also demonstrated the need for a coordinated response to a large-scale online threat. Researchers at MIT, Berkeley, Purdue, and other institutions pooled their resources in order to determine the best solution to mitigate the worm  Eisenberg et al., 1989 .  It  was,  however,  a  substantial  investment  of  time  and  resources  due  to  the distributed nature of the teams and the attack itself. Thus, DARPA  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense , one of the founders of the Internet  itself,  sponsored  the  foundation  of  the  first  Computer  Emergency  Response Team  CERT  at Carnegie Mellon University in order to serve as a coordinating point for  responses  to  major  network  emergencies   Eisenberg  et  al.,  1989 .  This  CERT  now serves a pivotal role in the dissemination of information related to serious cyber-threats and determining large-scale responses to vulnerabilities and security threats.  Blended threats and ancillary tools  In  addition  to  these  three  forms  of  malware,  there  are  now  blended  threats  operating online that combine the distinct aspects of these codes into a single functional tool. A common  blended  threat  is  botnet  malware,  which  combines  aspects  of  trojan  horse programs  and  viruses  into  a  single  program.  Botnet  malware  is  often  sent  to  a  victim through an attachment or other mechanism  Bacher, Holz, Kotter, and Wicherski, 2005; Symantec, 2016 . Once the program is executed, it then installs a “bot” program, meaning that the computer can now receive commands and be controlled by another user through IRC channels or the Web via http protocols. The infected machine then surreptitiously contacts a pre-programmed IRC channel to wait for commands from the bot operator. Multiple machines that are infected with this malware will contact the channel, creating a  “botnet,”  or  network  of  zombie  machines   see  Figure  4.3 .  This  form  of  malware  is often very easy to control through the use of sophisticated interfaces that make sending commands to the network relatively easy to accomplish. According to Symantec  2016 , there has been a decrease in the number of bots over the past few years. They identified 1.1 million bots in 2015, down from 1.9 million in 2014, and 2.3 million in 2013.  For  more  information  on  botnets,  go  online  to:  www.youtube.  com watch? v=Soe3b6sXuVI.  152   Fig. 4.3 Botnet command and control distribution Source: Wikimedia Commons  Tom-b  The size of botnets enables their operators to engage in a wide range of cybercrimes, including  the  distribution  of  spam  and  other  malware.  Botnets  may  also  be  used  to perform  distributed  denial-of-service   DDoS   attacks.  In  a  DDoS  attack,  each computer in the network attempts to contact the same computer or server  Bacher et al., 2005 . The target system becomes flooded with requests and cannot handle the volume, resulting  in  a  loss  of  services  to  users   see  Figure  4.4  for  an  example  of  a  botnet  user interface . This is an extremely costly form of cybercrime for companies, as they can lose millions  of  dollars  in  revenue  if  customers  cannot  access  their  services.  “Bot  masters” may  therefore  attempt  DDoS  attacks  against  specific  websites  to  cause  financial  and reputation problems for the website owner, but they may also blackmail the organization to pay a ransom to stop the DDoS attack. In other cases, it may also serve as a way to distract  IT  teams  so  that  they  do  not  notice  stealthier  intrusions  into  the  system  Symantec, 2016 .  Botnets  are  now  a  common  form  of  malware  as  indicated  by  active  infections  and operations  around  the  world.  These  types  of  attacks  are  growing  in  both  number  and intensity,  although  most  last  for  under  30  minutes   Symantec,  2016 .  For  example,  the  153   BBC  in  the  UK  experienced  a  recent  attack  in  2015  in  which  its  website  and  services were  down  for  several  hours,  leading  some  experts  to  believe  that  it  was  possibly  the largest  DDoS  attack  ever.  The  US  FBI  has  engaged  in  two  separate  investigative crackdowns  against  botnet  operators  under  the  code  name  “  Operation:  Bot  Roast” between  2005  and  2010   Hedquist,  2008 .  These  operations  led  to  the  arrests  of individuals in the USA and New Zealand  Goodin, 2007; Hedquist, 2008 .  Fig. 4.4 An example of the Illusion Bot Malware GUI  There have been a number of recent high-profile arrests of botnet operators around the  globe  for  their  role  in  various  cybercrime  schemes.  For  instance,  two  Greek  men were  arrested  in  2014  for  operating  a  botnet  called  Lecpetex  that  used  Facebook  and email spam to contact potential victims  Sparkes, 2014 . The botnet affected over 250,000 computers  in  North  and  South  America,  as  well  as  in  Europe  and  the  UK.  Once  an individual’s  system  was  infected,  it  would  install  a  tool  designed  to  mine  an  online currency called Litecoin and send any funds accrued back to the operators  see Chapter 6 for  more  details  on  cryptocurrencies .  This  unique  example  demonstrates  the  diverse utility  of  botnet  malware.  In  addition,  the  insecurity  of  the  Internet  of  Things   IoT , including  thermostats,  security  systems,  refrigerators,  and  many  other  household appliances,  has  led  these  devices  to  become  infected  with  malware  to  enable  DDoS attacks. A specialized piece of malware called Mirai was used by attackers in the fall of 2016  to  DDoS  Twitter,  Spotify,  and  other  services  depending  on  the  Dyn  protocol   F-  154   Secure,  2017 .  This  malware  infected  both  regular  computer  systems  and  IoT  devices, enabling them to be used as a stable attack platform for cybercrime. We will return to the IoT threat issue in the final chapter of this book.  Similarly, malware writers have recently developed tools that can infect web browsers and  thereby  enable  remote  takeovers  of  computer  systems.  These  programs  are  called exploit  packs  and  must  be  installed  on  a  web  server  in  order  to  attack  individuals visiting a website. The exploit pack malware contains multiple common vulnerabilities for  the  most  prevalent  web  browsers  and  its  associated  exploits.  The  program  then detects  the  type  and  version  of  browser  software  an  individual  is  using  to  go  to  that website, and cycles through these vulnerabilities and exploits until it can infect the user  Symantec, 2016 .  This  type  of  attack  exponentially  increases  the  ease  of  infection  by  operating surreptitiously and without the need for true user interaction to activate the malicious code   see  Box  4.3  for  an  interview  with  the  creator  of  the  exploit  pack  MPack;  also Symantec, 2016 . An individual must  unknowingly  direct their web browser to a site hosted on a server with the toolkit in order to begin the process of infection, which is much simpler than trying to get someone to open an attachment or file. This is why such attacks are commonly known as “drive-by downloads” in that a victim need only visit the  site  without  clicking  on  anything  in  order  to  be  infected   Symantec,  2009 .  In addition, web browsers often store sensitive information about a user such as passwords and  common  sites  visited,  thereby  increasing  the  risk  of  identity  theft,  data  loss,  and computer  misuse.  Once  the  infection  payload  is  executed,  the  attacker  can  then  send additional malware to the system, including rootkits and trojans to gain further control over the system  Symantec, 2009 .  Symantec   2016   reports  that  vulnerabilities  in  websites  remain  a  critical  issue,  as website  administrators  fail  to  properly  secure  websites.  They  found  that  more  than  75 percent of all websites have unpatched vulnerabilities. One out of every seven websites  15%   have  critical  vulnerabilities,  allowing  individuals  to  use  minimal  effort  to  gain access and manipulate these websites.  Box 4.3 Interview with MPack creator  www.theregister.co.uk 2007 07 23 mpack_developer_interview.  MPack developer on automated infection kit  In late June, SecurityFocus answered an online advertisement for the MPack infection kit, sending an ICQ message to the identifier listed in the ad. A few days later, a person contacted SecurityFocus through ICQ. [.] What follows is the result of two weeks of interviews that took place.  This article provides an interview with one of the developers of the well-known and highly  profitable  exploit  pack  called  MPack.  This  interview  provides  insights  into  155   the  nature  of  malware  creation,  distribution,  and  the  individuals  responsible  for their development.  An additional blended threat that has gained a great deal of popularity over the past decade is called ransomware or scareware. These threats demand that the operator of the  infected  system  pay  in  order  to  have  their  system’s  functionality  restored   Panda Security, 2015; Russinovich, 2013 . Ransomware is similar to a trojan in that it spreads through  downloadable  files  or  through  websites.  Once  the  prospective  target  executes the  file,  it  will  then  deploy  its  payload  which  either  encrypts  files  on  the  user’s  hard drive or may modify the boot record of the system  similar to a virus  to restrict what the user can access  Russinovich, 2013 . The payload may also include messages that are displayed to the victim indicating that their computer has been used for illegal activities like child pornography and has been shut down by law enforcement. Some also indicate that the operating system of the infected computer has been corrupted or is counterfeit and will not work until the user pays a fee  Russinovich, 2013 . These messages require the  user  to  pay  so  that  the  functionality  or  files  will  be  restored.  Once  payment  is received, the victim receives a program to either decrypt the file or unlock the affected portions of the system.  There  have  been  several  notable  examples  of  ransomware,  including  the  recent Cryptolocker program which was first identified in September 2013  Ferguson, 2013; F- Secure,  2017;  Panda  Security,  2015 .  The  program  spreads  via  attachments  in  either emails  or  as  downloadable  malware  online  and  targets  Microsoft  Windows  systems. Once it is executed, the code encrypts data on any hard drives attached to the infected system using a very strong encryption protocol  Ferguson, 2013 . The key to decrypt the file  is  sent  to  a  command-and-control  structure   similar  to  a  botnet   and  the  victim  is told  that  they  have  to  pay  a  specific  fee,  often  in  bitcoins,  or  the  key  will  be  deleted within three days  Ferguson, 2013 .  Although  the  malware  itself  can  be  removed  with  some  ease,  the  encrypted  files cannot  be  readily  repaired,  which  makes  this  a  very  challenging  threat  for  computer users.  In  fact,  Panda  Security   2015   named  ransomware  the  most  dangerous  form  of cyber-attack  of  the  first  quarter  of  2015.  Although  this  attack  can  affect  all  users, cybercriminals appear to prefer to attack companies rather than citizens, since they have more valuable data to which they need access.  Victims of ransomware have often been encouraged to simply pay the ransom in order  156   to minimize the potential harm caused by an infection, especially large organizations if they did not have backup systems to protect their data. A recent IBM  2016  study found that  70  percent  of  businesses  infected  with  ransomware  paid  the  ransom;  half  of  the businesses paid over $10,000 and 20 percent paid over $40,000. Multiple hospitals across the USA were affected by ransomware in 2015 and 2016, and paid their attackers in order to  avoid  the  loss  of  sensitive  operational  systems  and  patient  files   Zetter,  2016 . Similarly, at least three banks, a pharmaceutical company, a US police department, and multiple  government  agencies  in  India  were  affected  by  ransomware  in  2016   IANS, 2016; Panda Security, 2015 .  We  should  continue  to  see  ransomware  as  a  serious  problem  moving  forward, partially  because  of  the  business  model  that  is  being  employed  by  these  offenders   F- Secure, 2017 . Criminals set the prices for individuals and organizations at levels where paying the ransom is a more efficient and possibly even more effective means to retrieve the  data.  They  are  also  starting  to  provide  assistance  in  the  form  of  web  pages  in different  the cybercriminals  for  assistance,  help  with  making  bitcoin  payments,  and  even  free  trial decryption of a file  F-Secure, 2017 .  languages,  FAQs  sections,  support  channels   to  directly  contact   For more details on the ways in which victims should respond to ransomware, go  online  to:  www.wired.com wp-content uploads 2016 03 RansomwareManual- 1.pdf.  157   The global impact of malware  Computer  security  experts  continue  to  express  alarm  about  the  current  number  of malicious  software  programs  and  the  increases  they  expect  to  see  in  the  future. Unfortunately,  the  statistics  over  the  past  several  years  have  not  improved.  Before providing additional statistics and insights, it should be pointed out that these companies profit  by  selling  computer  security  services  to  individuals  and  corporations.  Thus,  it behooves them to discuss this issue as a crisis, though all available statistics appear to support their concerns.  The number of new malicious software programs introduced into the wild each year is tremendous. Although the figures provided by different security companies vary widely, they demonstrate the magnitude of the malware problem. Symantec  2016  reported that they  found  over  431  million  new  pieces  of  malware  in  2015;  this  was  a  36  percent increase  from  the  previous  year.  F-Secure   2017   added  over  127  million  new  malware programs  in  2016  to  their  database  that  now  consists  of  600  million  malware  samples. Panda Security noted in their 2015 annual report that 84 million variations of malware were  released  into  the  wild  in  2015,  making  an  average  of  230,000  samples  identified each  day   Panda  Security,  2015 .  These  additional  84  million  strains  bring  their  total database of malware to approximately 304 million! This also means that 27.36 percent of all  malware  that  has  ever  existed  was  actually  created  in  2015  alone.  More  than  half  51.45%  of the new malware strains released in 2015 were trojans  Panda Security, 2015 . Trojans  were  responsible  for  60.30  percent  of  new  infections   Panda  Security,  2015 . Viruses were the second most common form of malware released  22.79 percent; Panda Security, 2015 , but caused only 2.55 percent of all infections. The second most common malware  that  caused  infections  were  Potentially  Unwanted  Programs   PUPs   at  28.98 percent  Panda Security, 2015 .  Malware  infections  may  clearly  be  viewed  as  a  global  problem,  considering  the percentage of computers around the world that have experienced malware encounters. Panda Security  2015  estimated that almost one out of every three computers around the world   32.13  percent   are  infected  with  some  form  of  malware.  They  found  that  this estimate  is  partially  driven  by  the  existence  of  potentially  unwanted  programs  on people’s computers. They also note that although they refer to the estimate as “infected computers,” the figure really focuses on the percentage of computers that had malware encounters and that it does not necessarily mean they were infected. This estimate may also be high considering that their sample consists of individuals using their free online scanning program. Many of the individuals who used this free scan may have done so out of fears that their computer was infected.  Based  on  Panda  Security’s   2015   free  scanning  tool,  we  see  that  Asian  and  Latin  American nations comprise the highest proportion of nations with infected systems:  158   1.  China  57.24% ; 2.  Taiwan  49.15% ; 3.  Turkey  42.52% ; 4.  Guatemala  39.0% ; 5.  Russia  36.01% ; 6.  Ecuador  35.51% ; 7.  Mexico  34.52% ; 8.  Peru  34.23% ; 9.  Poland  34.13% ; 10.  Brazil  33.34% .  1.  Finland  20.32% ; 2.  Norway  20.51% ; 3.  Sweden  20.88% ; 4.  United Kingdom  21.34% ; 5.  Germany  22.78% ; 6.  Switzerland  23.16% ; 7.  Belgium  23.46% ; 8.  Denmark  24.84% ; 9.  Japan  25.34% ; 10.  Netherlands  26.51% .  Aside  from  Japan,  the  top  ten  countries  with  the  smallest  percentage  of  computers  infected are all in Europe:  Note that the country with the least percentage of computers infected  Sweden  still has one out of every five computers infected with malware, or at least had an encounter with  malware.  Three  other  countries  of  interest  to  our  readers  all  had  infection  rates below the international rate: Australia  26.87% ; Canada  29.03% ; and the USA  29.48% .

Each Cyber Security Bulletin provides a summary of  the  new  vulnerabilities  recorded  during  the  past  week  by  the  National  Institute  of Standards and Technology  NIST  National Vulnerability Database  NVD . This database is  sponsored  by  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security   DHS   National  Cybersecurity and  Communications  Integration  Center   NCCIC  United  States  Computer  Emergency Readiness  Team   US-CERT .  The  vulnerabilities  are  categorized  by  severity   high, medium, and low  based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System  CVSS  standard. For example, a vulnerability will be categorized as high if its CVSS score is between 7.0 and 10.0, medium if between 4.0 to 6.9, and low if between 0.0 and 3.9. This information is  made  more  informative  by  organizations  and  US-CERT  providing  additional information,  including  identifying  information,  values,  definitions,  related  links,  and patches if available.  Any  examination  of  two  of  these  weekly  vulnerability  reports  shows  how  many serious vulnerabilities are identified and reported on a weekly basis. In Cyber Security Bulletin SB17–051  US-CERT, 2017a , which covers the week of February 13, 2017, there were 39 high-threat vulnerabilities, 98 medium vulnerabilities, 8 low vulnerabilities, and over 100 vulnerabilities whose severity was not yet ranked. For the week of February 6, 2017, reported in Cyber Security Bulletin SB17–044  US-CERT, 2017a , there were 61 high vulnerabilities, 52 medium, 12 low, and over 100 not yet ranked.  Although this chapter focuses primarily on computer systems and their users, scholars and  security  experts  also  warn  about  the  vulnerabilities  of  smart  phones,  particularly Android  operating  systems,  and  personal  digital  assistants   PDAs .  Although  mobile attacks are still less common relative to PC attacks, there is an expectation that mobile attacks  will  increase  substantially  in  the  near  future   F-Secure,  2017;  Panda  Security, 2015; Ruggiero and Foote, 2011; Symantec, 2016 . F-Secure  2017  reports that there are over  19  million  malware  programs  developed  specifically  for  the  Android  system. Symantec   2016   reported  the  finding  of  528  new  mobile  vulnerabilities  in  2015,  a  214 percent increase from the prior year, and 3,944 malware variants for the Android system. It is expected that there will be an increase in attacks against Android operating systems because smart phones and PDAs have some of the same advanced computing abilities as traditional computer systems. They give the user access to the Internet and email, have address books, and have GPS navigation. They also allow people to purchase items using wireless  networks,  access  bank  accounts,  set  alarms  on  houses,  and  make  purchases through various online retailers. Thus, Android running devices are already at risk of the full  spectrum  of  malware  that  affects  PCs,  including  viruses,  worms,  trojans, ransomware, and others  F-Secure, 2017 .  The  issue  that  separates  mobile  devices  from  computers  is  their  use  of  security protections. Smart phones and tablets have lax or poor security, as they do not come pre- installed  with  firewalls  or  antivirus  programs.  These  tools  are  available  for  purchase, though it is unclear how many individuals actually install antivirus protection on their  160   mobile  devices.  In  addition,  operating  systems  for  mobile  phones  are  updated  less frequently  than  those  for  computers,  creating  greater  opportunities  for  attackers  to exploit known vulnerabilities. This problem is compounded by the fact that smart phone and mobile device users are generally unaware of these problems but believe that their devices  are  just  as  secure  as  their  computers.  Thus,  many  computer  security  experts believe  that  as  smart  phones  become  more  prevalent  and  have  more  of  the  same capabilities and data files as PCs, they will become a more lucrative venture for malware writers  F-Secure, 2017 .  It  is  difficult  to  even  create  rough  estimates  on  the  amounts  that  hackers  and malicious  programs  have  cost  citizens,  organizations,  government  agencies,  and  the global  economy.  When  considering  the  financial  costs,  one  has  to  not  only  count  the actual direct damage of the malware, such as having to replace a computer, but also the amount  of  time,  money,  and  manpower  spent  trying  to  prevent  an  infection  and  then fixing  the  problem  if  an  infection  occurs.  Malware  can  disrupt  network  operations, delete, steal, or manipulate files, allow access to confidential files, and generally damage computer systems and hardware. In addition, there are the indirect costs to businesses that  arise  from  consumer  lack  of  confidence  in  online  purchases  or  credit  card  use.  If consumers  lose  confidence  in  the  security  and  privacy  of  their  online  purchases,  they will be less likely to spend money online in general and with specific companies that had reported  particular  problems.  On  the  other  hand,  vendors  themselves  may  also  fear online transactions if they are unsure that the person on the other side is really who they say  they  are.  In  order  to  address  these  problems,  companies  and  financial  institutions spend billions of dollars on verification and other computer security programs to ensure safety. In the end, these costs increase the cost of doing business, which is handed down to the consumer.  Over the past decade, various experts and companies have estimated that hack attacks cost  the  world  economy  over  $1  trillion  per  year.  Considering  that   1   more  malicious software is created each year;  2  the number of specialized hacks occurring throughout the  world  has  increased;   3   more  individuals  around  the  world  are  connected  to  the Internet;   4   more  companies  conduct  online  business  transactions;  and   5   more companies  and  governments  spend  additional  funds  on  computer  security  to  address these problems, it is safe to say that the cost of malware must be higher than what is otherwise spent to mitigate and prevent malicious software infections and hacks. In fact, the  total  cost  of  cybercrime  may  reach  $2  trillion  globally  by  2019   Forbes,  2016 .  It  is extremely  difficult,  however,  to  create  total  costs  of  cybercrime  estimates  due  to  the disparity  in  available  loss  metrics.  To  that  end,  some  companies  and  vendors  estimate the average cost of cybercrime per company or consumer. For example, Ponemon  2016  estimated that hacking costs the average US firm over $15 million per year, twice that of the  global  average.  In  addition,  over  58  million  Americans  had  at  least  one  malware infection over the previous year, amounting to over $4 billion in repair or replacement costs  Consumer Reports, 2013 .  The  costs  of  hacking  and  malware  infection,  however,  are  not  only  financial.  There  161   are  also  potential  emotional  consequences  for  victims,  though  there  little criminological research on how victims of malware infection and hacking incidents feel afterward. For many people, malware infection is nothing more than a minor nuisance that can be fixed easily. Some, however, may feel that their personal space was violated and personal privacy lost forever. Victims may not be able to identify the source of the infection, whether from a website, bad attachment, or other medium. As a result, some may  change  their  online  habits  in  order  to  reduce  their  perceived  risk  of  future infections.  is   In  addition,  some  victims  may  feel  that  they  are  to  blame  for  their  victimization experience. Since computer security principles currently revolve around self-protection practices,  like  the  use  of  protective  software,  hard  passwords,  and  careful  online behavior,  victims  may  see  themselves  as  the  source  of  their  financial  and  emotional harm resulting from an infection.  162   Hackers and malware writers  Although hackers are often associated with the use of malware, not all hackers have the ability  to  create  these  programs.  It  takes  some  degree  of  skill  and  knowledge  of programming  languages,  vulnerabilities,  and  exploits  in  order  to  create  effective malware. There is a high demand for malicious code among hackers of all types, as they can make an attack much easier to complete. As a result, the demand for malware can far surpass the capacities present in the current hacker community.  The very limited body of research considering the activities and interests of malware writers suggests that they generally operate within and share the norms and values of the  larger  hacker  subculture   see  Chapter  3  for  details .  Malware  writers  have  a  deep interest  in  technology,  which  is  an  absolute  necessity  in  order  to  identify  distinct vulnerabilities  in  software  or  hardware  and  to  find  innovative  ways  to  exploit  them. Writing malicious code can therefore be an exercise in creativity, as the individuals must challenge themselves and their understanding of the limits of an operating system and their  own  coding  capabilities.  For  instance,  the  Elk  Cloner  virus   see  p.  133   is  an excellent  example  of  creative  malware  coding,  as  the  author  liked  to  play  pranks  and creatively apply his knowledge to computer systems.  They  may  also  be  motivated  by  the  desire  to  cause  harm  or  get  revenge  against someone who they perceive to have wronged them  Bissett and Shipton, 2000; Gordon, 2000 . For instance, a system administrator named Andy Lin was sentenced to 30 months in a US federal prison in 2008 for planting a form of malicious code called a “logic bomb” on the servers of Medco Health Solutions where he worked for some time  Noyes, 2008 . Lin  installed  a  program  in  2003  that  would  execute  its  payload  and  wipe  out  all  data stored on over 70 servers in the company’s network in the event that he was laid off. When it appeared possible that he would lose his job, he set the code to activate on April 23, 2004. The program, however, was unsuccessful. He therefore kept it in place and reset the deployment date to April 2005. A system administrator within the company found the bomb code in the system and was able to neutralize the code. While this scheme was unsuccessful, it demonstrates the inherent danger malware can cause in the hands of the right actor.  Writers may also develop a piece of malware because they believe they may garner fame  or  notoriety  in  the  hacker  community   Bissett  and  Shipton,  2000;  Gordon,  2000; Holt  and  Kilger,  2012 .  In  the  late  1990s  and  early  2000s,  the  preponderance  of  worms and viruses led their creators to generate worldwide attention because of the harm they could cause to the majority of computer users around the world. That kind of attention could easily serve as an individual’s calling card and help them demonstrate their level of  skill  in  order  to  gain  a  legitimate  job  in  the  security  industry   Taylor,  1999 . Alternatively, the author may simply be able to show everyone what they are capable of  163   doing with enough careful planning and execution.  As  patterns  of  technology  use  have  changed  and  individuals  are  increasingly  using technology  in  all  facets  of  everyday  life,  malware  writers  have  begun  to  target  these users  to  set  up  stable  attack  platforms  based  on  networks  of  infected  computers   Holt and  Kilger,  2012 .  Virus  writers  and  creators  now  recognize  that  not  everyone  has  the ability  to  write  such  code,  but  if  the  actor  is  proficient  enough  as  a  hacker  they  will understand how to leverage a tool to their own benefit. As a result, malware writers are increasingly motivated by economic gain through sales of tools and code to others in the community   Holt,  2013;  Holt  and  Kilger,  2012 .  Typically,  tools  are  advertised  through forums and IRC channels, and then direct negotiations occur between buyers and sellers. Direct sales of programs to others can generate a relatively healthy income that exceeds what  may  otherwise  be  available  as  a  salary  through  existing  jobs   see  Box  4.4  for details .  Thus,  malware  writers  share  some  common  ideas  with  the  larger  hacker community,  though  the  skill  and  sophistication  involved  in  the  creation  of  malware differentiates them from the larger population of unskilled or semiskilled hackers.  Box 4.4 Interview with the malware writer Corpse  http:  computersweden.idg.se 2.2683 1.93344.  Meeting the Swedish bank hacker  For  the  price  of  3,000  dollars,  our  reporter  was  offered  his  personal  bank  Trojan.  In  an  interview  with Computer  Sweden,  the  hacker  behind  the  recent  Internet  frauds  against  Sweden’s  Nordea  bank  claims responsibility for more intrusions. “99 percent of all bank intrusions are kept secret,” he insists.  This in-depth interview with Corpse, the creator of a well-known trojan, describes why he made it. The account demonstrates that some hackers are clearly aware of how  their  programs  have  malicious  application  and  will  harm  individuals  on  a global scale.  164   The market for malicious software  The range of currently active malware is staggering and appears to increase every year. Even new devices and platforms, such as tablet computers and mobile phones, are being targeted by malware writers. The continuing evolution of malware raises a fundamental question  about  the  true  capability  of  malware  users  and  creators.  Are  malware  users writing these codes primarily on their own or are they gaining access to these resources through  others?  There  is  sufficient  evidence  that  the  skills  needed  to  identify vulnerabilities  and  devise  malware  around  that  weakness  are  limited  in  the  hacker community   see  Chapter  3  for  details .  Unskilled  hackers,  therefore,  must  acquire malware for their personal use from other sources.  In the 1990s, hackers would share their resources for free through direct downloads hosted  on  forums  and  file-sharing  sites   Taylor,  1999 .  The  global  proliferation  of  the Internet  and  computer  technology  expanded  the  number  of  available  targets  for compromise. As personal information became more prevalent in online spaces, the use of attacks to gain monetary advantage also increased  Holt, 2013 . As a result, some hackers recognized the monetary value of their attack tools and resources, and began to sell them to others through online markets operating in forums and IRC. The emergence of botnets was  a  critical  factor  in  the  facilitation  of  cybercrime  markets,  as  bot  owners  and operators  realized  that  they  could  lease  out  their  infrastructure  to  others  who  were unable  to  develop  similar  resources  on  their  own   Bacher  et  al.,  2005 .  Since  botnets could be used for DDoS attacks, spam distribution, and as a mechanism to route attack traffic through victim systems, the operators began to offer these services to others at a relatively low price. This is why some in the cyber-security community refer to botnets as “crimeware” in that it can be used as a stable platform for cybercrime  Bacher et al., 2005 .  For  more  www.youtube.com watch?v=bVo5ihJoQek.  information  on   the  market   for  malware,  go  online   to:  In  order  to  understand  the  normative  orders  that  shape  cybercrime  markets,  it  is  165   necessary  to  first  consider  the  structure  of  the  market  as  a  whole.  Forums  and  IRC channels  constitute  an  interconnected  marketplace  where  sellers  advertise  products openly  for  others  to  buy,  or  alternatively  describe  the  products  they  are  seeking  from other vendors  see Chu, Holt, and Ahn, 2010; Holt, 2013; Motoyama, McCoy, Levchenko, Savage, and Voelker, 2011 . Both buyers and sellers provide as thorough a description of their  products  or  tools  as  possible,  including  the  costs  and  preferred  payment mechanisms and their contact information. For example, the following is an ad posted by a botnet operator who would lease out his infrastructure to others:  Lease of bot networks!, $100 a month  volume 6.9k online from 300 [nodes]   I’m  leasing  the  admin  console  of  a  bot  network!  –  there  are  ~9,000  bots  in  the  network   200–1,500  online regularly  – Countries: RU,US,TR, UE,KI,TH,RO,CZ,IN,SK,UA   upon  request  countries  can  be  added!   –  OS: winXP NT  functionality: [+]  list  of  bot  socks  [known  proxies]  type:  ip:port  time   when  it  appeared  the  last time  CountryCity [allows you to] load [.] files on the [infected] bot machines  trojans grabbers [.]  [the] admin console quite simple, convenient and functional, even a school kid can figure it out.

This  post  illustrates  the  functionality  of  the  malware,  the  global  spread  of  this  botnet with infected systems throughout the world, and the costs to lease their services. It also indicates that the user prefers to be paid though the online currency system Web Money  Holt, 2013 . The preference for electronic payment systems is driven in part by the fact that they allow relatively immediate payments between buyers and sellers with no need for  face-to-face  interactions.  This  provides  a  modicum  of  privacy  and  anonymity  for participants  and  rapid  dissemination  of  the  goods   Holt,  2013 .  At  the  same  time, however, buyers are disadvantaged because a seller may not deliver the goods for which they provided payment. In addition, individuals could advertise their products directly to others with little regulation or constraint. Thus, buyers must carefully consider who they purchase goods and services from and in what quantities, to reduce their risk of loss.  Social forces within cybercrime markets  The forums that support the market for malware provide a unique interactive experience driven  by  exchanges  between  buyers  and  sellers.  The  behavior  of  participants  is, however, structured by the needs and risks they face. Research by Holt  2013  suggests that  there  are  three  factors  that  affect  the  practices  of  market  actors:   1   price;   2  customer service; and  3  trust.  The cost of goods and services played an important role in the vetting of goods and services within the market. Price may be one of the most pertinent factors in cybercrime markets to draw in potential customers because they may have limited funds or seek the greatest value for their investments  Holt, 2013; Motoyama et al., 2011 . Individuals who offered  a  service  or  form  of  malware  were  subject  to  scrutiny  based  on  the  price  of  a  166   product, particularly if it was perceived to be too high or too low. The active questioning of costs helped clarify the acceptable price for a given product and reduce the likelihood that individuals would pay exorbitant fees for specific services  Holt, 2013 .  The importance of price in the decision-making process led some advertisers to offer discounts  and  deals  to  attract  prospective  customers.  One  of  the  most  common techniques  involved  offering  bulk  discounts  to  sell  products  in  large  quantities.  For instance,  a  DDoS  service  provider  used  the  following  language  in  one  of  their  ads: “When ordering the DDoS service for 3–6 days, discount is 10%, with a DDoS service of more  than  7  days,  discount  is  20%,  and  with  a  DDoS  service  for  3  sites,  gives  a  free service for the 4th site.” The pricing and discount structures suggest that the prices of goods  and  services  are  variable,  but  those  making  large  purchases  receive  the  greatest overall  value   Holt,  2013 .  In  addition,  price  serves  as  an  important  first  step  in establishing a relationship between buyers and sellers.  The  second  and  interrelated  factor  affecting  market  actors  was  customer  service. Although  competitive  pricing  may  help  entice  prospective  customers,  individuals  also sought  the  most  satisfactory  experience  possible.  The  outcome  of  a  purchase  was significantly  influenced  by  the  ways  in  which  sellers  cater  to  their  customers, particularly  those  individuals  without  substantive  technological  skills   Holt,  2013; Motoyama et al., 2011 . Since the market allows less proficient hackers to acquire goods and  services  that  increase  their  overall  attack  efficacy,  individual  sellers  took  steps  to ensure that all buyers would be satisfied with their products and services.  One of the most critical indicators of customer services lies in the speed with which sellers respond to requests from potential buyers. Sellers who were regularly online and could  be  easily  contacted  were  more  likely  to  generate  positive  reviews  and  feedback from  customers   Holt,  2013 .  Those  who  did  not  respond  quickly  to  messages  from prospective  buyers  or  were  difficult  to  reach  received  negative  comments  from  forum users.  The  quality  of  the  product  or  service  a  seller  offered  was  also  critical  for  their prospective buyers. This was exemplified in a post from the malware installer cryptor, who noted: “our price may look to you not so adequate, but the quality will cancel this out, do not forget, that the cheap one pays twice.” If a tool was ineffective or data was insufficient,  a  buyer  may  post  bad  reviews  or  not  recommend  that  provider.  The importance of quality was particularly evident in posts from DDoS vendors who noted regularly that they would give customers a free ten-minute test to measure the efficacy of their services against a particular target  Holt, 2013 .  The  final  factor  affecting  participant  relations  in  the  market  for  malware  was  trust between  participants.  Buyers  sought  out  commodities  that  they  valued  and  were required to pay for goods without actually interacting with a seller in person  Holt, 2013; Motoyama et al., 2011 . As a result, they may not receive the goods they paid for or may receive  bogus  products  with  no  value.  In  addition,  most  data  and  services  sold  were either illegally acquired or a violation of the law. Buyers therefore could not pursue civil or  criminal  claims  against  a  less  than  reputable  seller.  As  a  result,  three  informal  167   mechanisms emerged within the market to ensure a degree of trust between participants and reduce the likelihood of loss.  The  first  mechanism  available  to  validate  a  seller’s  claims  was  the  use  of  checks  or tests by the forum administration as a means to validate the quality of a product sold in the  forum.  For  instance,  one  forum  described  its  checking  process  through  this  simple description:  “[The]  Administration  [of  the  forum]  has  the  right  to  ask  any  seller  to present his her product for check. You present the product in the form that it is being sold,  so  that  it  can  be  checked  for  a  test.  No  videos,  audio,  screens.”  Going  through  a checking process demonstrates that a vendor is willing to demonstrate that their services are  reliable  and  trustworthy.  In  turn,  prospective  clients  can  feel  comfortable  with  an assessment  of  the  individual’s  level  of  trust  based  on  their  product  or  services   Holt, 2013 .  The  second  method  employed  in  malware  markets  to  build  trust  was  the  use  of guarantor  programs   Holt,  2013 .  Given  that  the  majority  of  the  products  and  services offered  in  these  markets  are  illegal  or  can  be  used  to  break  the  law,  participants  have little  legal  recourse  if  they  are  slighted  at  some  point  in  their  exchange.  Guarantors served  as  a  specialized  payment  mechanism  that  can  be  used  to  deal  with  individuals who  may  or  may  not  be  trustworthy.  The  following  quote  is  from  a  well-known market’s description of their guarantor service process:  The seller and the buyer get in touch with one of the representatives of the guarantor service by icq and they come to agreement on the EXACT terms of the transaction. When agreement has been reached, the buyer gives the guarantor the amount of the transaction  or as it was shown in the contract .[.] The Seller gives the goods to the buyer, after examining the quality of the goods, the buyer advises that the seller can give the money, and the guarantor gives the money. Commission is not charged by the guarantor.  This post demonstrates the value of guarantors to minimize the potential risk of loss an individual may incur. The use of guarantors is not consistent across the various markets operating,  but  those  which  operate  such  a  service  may  be  better  organized  and  more sophisticated than others.  The third way in which individuals could gain or demonstrate trust within the forums was  through  customer  feedback.  Feedback  was  directly  impacted  by  fair  pricing  and strong  customer  service   Holt,  2013 .  Individuals  who  purchased  a  product  or  service could provide detailed comments about their experience with a seller for other users so that they may understand how that person operates. Posts that gave favorable reviews or positive  comments  demonstrated  that  an  individual  is  trustworthy.  Such  information helps build a solid and trustworthy reputation for a seller and may potentially increase their  market  share  and  customer  base  over  time.  At  the  same  time,  individuals  who provided bad services or were untrustworthy received negative feedback. As a whole, the market  for  malicious  software  and  attack  services  provides  unique  insights  into  the process of acquiring the resources needed to engage in cybercrime.  168   Legal challenges in dealing with malware  Despite the substantial harm malware can cause, many nations have not criminalized its creation.  The  process  of  creating  malware  is  an  exercise  in  creative  thinking  and innovation,  which  can  be  inherently  valuable  to  the  computer  security  community  to better  secure  systems.  Instead,  most  nations  choose  to  prosecute  malware  use  under existing  statutes  regarding  computer  hacking.  The  direct  connection  between  malware use and hacking outcomes, such as data loss or manipulation, makes intuitive sense and creates a more streamlined criminal code without the addition of statutes that may not otherwise exist.  A  few  nations,  however,  have  specifically  defined  malware  in  their  criminal  codes. The  USA’s  Computer  Fraud  and  Abuse  Act  includes  malware-related  offenses  in addition  to  specific  hacking-related  offenses.  The  fifth  statue  of  this  act   18  USC  § 1030 a 5  involves the use of malware, making it illegal to:  1.  knowingly  cause  the  transmission  of  a  program,  information,  code,  or  command and thereby intentionally cause damage to a protected computer;  2.  intentionally  access  a  protected  computer  without  authorization  and  thereby  3.  intentionally  access  a  protected  computer  without  authorization  and  thereby  recklessly cause damage;  cause damage or loss.  The first part of this statute recognizes the distribution of malware, though that term is not  used  in  favor  of  the  terms  program,  information,  or  code,  as  it  provides  greater latitude in the identification of viruses, worms, and forms of software  see Box 4.5  for details on the arrest and prosecution of the creator of the Melissa Virus . The remaining two items involve ways in which malware may be used in the course of either reckless or  intentional  damage.  If  an  individual  is  found  guilty  of  violating  this  act,  they  may receive  a  fine  and  a  prison  sentence  of  between  two  years  and  life,  depending  on  the severity of their actions  see also Chapter 3 . For instance, if the use of malware leads to the death of another human being, they may be eligible for a life sentence. Although the likelihood of such an outcome is low, the recognition by legislators that malware may be used – intentionally or unintentionally – to cause harm in a real-world context is a clear step  forward  for  federal  prosecutors  to  fully  pursue  justice  for  the  actions  of cybercriminals.  Box 4.5 One of the first modern prosecutions for  malware distribution in the USA  169   http:  usatoday30.usatoday.com tech news 2002 05 01 melissa-virus.htm.  Creator of "Melissa" virus will get jail time  The creator of the “Melissa” computer virus was sentenced Wednesday to 20 months in federal prison for causing millions of dollars of damage by disrupting e-mail systems worldwide in 1999.  This article provides a good roundup of the rationale for prosecuting David L. Smith for  his  role  in  the  distribution  of  the  well-known  malware  program  called  the Melissa  virus,  as  well  as  the  relative  absence  of  arrests  otherwise  for  similar activities across the globe.  Since malware may be used to acquire sensitive passwords and other data, the CFAA now  includes  language  criminalizing  the  sale  or  exchange  of  user  information. Specifically, 18 USC § 1030 a 6 makes it illegal to knowingly sell, buy, or trade passwords or other information used to access a computer with the intent to defraud the victims. For instance, if an individual used a keylogging trojan to gather passwords and then sold that  information  to  others,  he  may  be  prosecuted  under  this  statute.  Importantly,  the computers harmed must be either:  1  involved in interstate or foreign commerce, or  2  operated  by  or  for  the  federal  government.  This  language  is  quite  broad  and  may  be interpreted  to  include  a  wide  range  of  computers  connected  to  the  Internet  owned  or operated  by  civilians   Brenner,  2011 .  Currently,  any  individual  found  guilty  of  this crime  may  be  fined  and  imprisoned  for  between  one  and  five  years  depending  on whether  the  offender  gained  commercially  or  financially  through  their  actions  or whether the value of the data exceeds $5,000. If, however, the individual is found guilty on multiple counts, they are eligible for up to ten years in prison  Brenner, 2011 .  The use of malware in order to extort funds from victims also led to the creation of CFAA language to criminalize threats to computer systems. 18 USC § 1030 a 7 made it illegal for an individual to extort money or anything of value on the basis of:  1  threats to cause damage to a protected computer;  2  threats to obtain information or affect the confidentiality  of  information  from  a  computer  without  authorization  or  exceeding authorized  access;  or   3   damage  to  a  computer  when  caused  to  enable  the  extortion. Anyone  found  guilty  of  this  offense  can  be  sentenced  using  the  same  guidelines  for trafficking in passwords, namely up to five years in prison and or a fine, or up to ten years  in  the  event  that  the  offender  has  prior  convictions.  These  laws  may  be  used  to  170   prosecute the use of ransomware, as well as DDoS attack ransom attempts.  In addition to these statutes at the federal level, there are currently at least 29 states in the USA that have outlawed the creation or distribution of malware. It is important to note that these statutes do not typically use the term virus or malware, but “computer contaminants”  designed  to  damage,  destroy,  or  transmit  information  within  a  system without the permission of the owner  Brenner, 2011 . The use of malware may constitute either  a  misdemeanor  or  felony  depending  on  the  harm  caused  and  the  individual’s access to sensitive data or information of a monetary value. In addition, 25 states have specific language criminalizing either DDoS or DoS attacks, and two states  California and  Wyoming   have  added  language  to  their  criminal  code  regarding  the  use  of ransomware   National  Conference  of  State  Legislatures,  2016 .  These  two  states  are interesting examples of how individual states may adapt to cyber-threats, though states may still be able to sanction offenders who use ransomware under existing malware or trespassing statutes.  Many other nations share similar legal frameworks regarding malware in that existing statutes concerning hacking may also be used to pursue malicious software cases. Few nations  specifically  criminalize  the  use  of  malware  but  rather  apply  existing  laws regarding hacking in these incidents. Australia, Canada, and India are examples of this strategy. In the UK, the UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 has some utility to account for malware-related  offenses  as  it  criminalized  unauthorized  access  to  computer  material and  unauthorized  modification  of  computer  material   see  Chapter  3 .  This  is  a  direct outcome  of  the  use  of  malware,  though  the  law  did  not  allow  for  direct  cases  against malware writers. As a result, the Police and Justice Act 2006 extended and revised this section  of  the  law  to  account  for  malware  distribution.  The  Act  added  three  offenses related to “making, supplying, or obtaining articles for use in computer misuse offenses,” including:  1.  Making, adapting, supplying, or offering to supply any article intending it to be used  to  commit,  or  to  assist  in  the  commission  of,  an  offense  under  the Computer Misuse Act.  2.  Supplying or offering to supply any article believing that it is likely to be used  in the commission of offenses under the Computer Misuse Act.  3.  Obtaining any article with a view to its being supplied for use to commit or  assist in the commission of offenses under the Computer Misuse Act.  These offenses carry a maximum sentence of two years and a fine, though it has drawn criticism  for  its  potential  use  to  prosecute  professionals  and  legitimate  security  tool developers  Brenner, 2011 .  The  Council  of  Europe’s  Convention  on  Cybercrime  does  not  specifically  include language  on  malware  in  order  to  avoid  the  use  of  terms  that  may  become  dated  or irrelevant  over  time   Council  of  Europe,  2013 .  Instead,  the  existing  articles  of  the Convention may be applied in some way to malware used in the course of cybercrime.  171   The  most  relevant  language  is  currently  included  in  Article  6  regarding  misuse  of devices. Specifically, this article makes it a violation of law to produce, sell, or otherwise make available a program or device designed to access computer systems, intercept or harm  data,  and  interfere  with  computer  systems  generally   Council  of  Europe,  2013 . This  article  is  not  designed  for  use  in  prosecuting  cases  where  individuals  have penetration-testing tools or codes designed to protect computer systems. In addition, this article  allows  flexibility  for  each  nation  to  decide  whether  they  want  to  include  this language  in  their  own  criminal  codes   Council  of  Europe,  2013 .  However,  the  use  of malware can be criminally prosecuted under laws designed to pursue the illegal access of systems.  172   Coordination and management in addressing malware  Since malware is prosecuted using similar legislation to computer hacking, many of the same agencies are responsible for the investigation of these offenses  see Chapter 3 . The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the USA, the Metropolitan Police Central e-crime Unit  PCeU  in the UK, and other agencies all investigate these crimes. There is, however, a much larger body of private agencies and commercial entities involved in the detection and mitigation of malicious software.  One  of  the  most  prominent  resources  available  for  industry  and  businesses  to  help mitigate  the  threat  of  malware  and  insulate  them  from  future  attack  are  computer emergency response teams  CERTs . As noted  see p. 140 , the first CERT was born out of the  Morris  worm,  which  demonstrated  the  need  to  develop  a  coordinated  response  to cyber-threats.  As  malware  became  more  prevalent  and  damaging  to  the  rapidly expanding  population  of  Internet  users  in  the  mid-1990s,  the  need  for  coordinated responses to threats increased substantially.  For more information on CERTs, go online to: www.cert.org.  There are now 369 publicly identified response teams in 79 nations around the world  FIRST, 2017 . They may go by different names depending on location. Some nations or locations  may  use  the  term  CERTs  while  others  use  the  name  Computer  Security Incident Response Teams  CSIRTs ,  but  they  serve  generally  similar  purposes.  There are  78  CERT  or  CSIRT  groups  in  the  USA  alone.  Some  are  housed  in  financial institutions  like  Bank  of  America  and  Scot-trade,  technology  companies  like  IBM  and Yahoo,  while  others  are  located  in  government  agencies  such  as  the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA . The primary CERT within the USA  US CERT-Coordination  Center   is  housed  at  Carnegie  Mellon  University.  It  provides reporting mechanisms for vulnerabilities and threats to systems, as well as security tools to  help  patch  and  protect  systems  from  attack   US-CERT,  2017c .  The  CERT  can  also serve to analyze and track threats as they evolve for virtually any branch of government and civilian networks, including threats for both home users and businesses. They act as  173   a focal point for the coordination of information concerning cyber-attacks that threaten civilian infrastructure  US-CERT, 2017b .  At  a  global  level,  there  are  now  CERTs  or  CSIRTs  on  every  continent.  The  greatest representations of units are within industrialized nations. Given the wide distribution of teams  and  threats  based  on  the  resources  within  a  given  nation,  there  is  a  need  for  a unifying body to help connect all these groups together. The global Forum for Incident Response  and  Security  Teams   FIRST   serves  to  coordinate  information  sharing  and connections  among  all  teams  worldwide   FIRST,  2017 .  FIRST  offers  security  courses, annual  conferences  for  incident  responses,  best  practice  documents  for  all  forms  of incident  response,  and  a  full  reference  library  of  security  research  and  materials  from across the globe. The Forum also creates working groups based on common interests or specific  needs,  such  as  their  Special  Interest  Group   SIG   which  links  respondents together to discuss common interests in order to explore a topic of specific technology and  share  expertise.  There  is  even  an  arm  of  FIRST  connected  to  the  International Standards Organization  ISO  in order to help inform policies and standards for cyber- security  incident  management,  evidence  handling,  and  vulnerability  disclosure  in  the field  FIRST, 2017 .  Perhaps  the  most  identifiable  entities  involved  in  the  response  to  malware  and hacking incidents are members of the antivirus and cyber-security industry. There are dozens of companies offering security tools to protect desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile computer systems either for a fee or at no cost to the user to secure various operating systems, whether Mac OS, Windows, Linux, or mobile OSs. You may know some of the more  prominent  companies  in  the  field,  and  use  some  of  their  products,  including BitDefender, Kaspersky, McAfee, Symantec, and Trend Micro. Most of these companies offer some type of antivirus software which protects the user by checking incoming files and data requests to guard against active infection attempts in real time and or scanning existing  files  to  detect  and  remove  malware  that  may  already  be  installed.  Antivirus software  works  through  the  use  of  heuristics,  or  signature-based  detection,  where  all system  files  on  a  computer  are  compared  against  known  signatures  or  definitions  of malware  to  determine  whether  an  infection  has  taken  place.  Similarly,  any  attempted download is compared against known definitions of malware in order to eliminate the likelihood of being actively infected.  The benefit of antivirus software is that it can help reduce the risk of mal-ware being able  to  actively  infect  a  protected  system.  The  use  of  heuristic  detection  systems  is, however, limited by their available knowledge. The definitions that the software has on file run the risk of being outdated every day, as new variants of malicious code are being produced all the time. Antivirus vendors have to create signatures for any new malware variant identified; thus they are constantly updating definitions. In addition, there is no necessary agreement between security companies as to the name or classification for a specific form of malware. Some vendors may tag something as a trojan, while another labels  it  a  virus,  making  it  difficult  to  standardize  the  identification  of  malware generally. If users do not have an up-to-date definitions file for their antivirus software  174   before it starts to scan for infections, the risk of infection from new malware is increased  Symantec,  2016 .  If  an  individual  never  updates  this  information,  then  his  or  her antivirus software can do very little to protect the system from new threats. As a result, the value of protective software is severely limited by the knowledge and skills of both the end user operating the software and the continual advancements in malware in the wild.  For more information on antivirus vendors, go online to:  1.  www.norton.com, 2.  www.sophos.com, 3.  www.avg.com.  In light of the limitations of antivirus software and the challenges posed by malware generally,  a  non-profit  organization  called  the  Anti-Malware  Testing  Standards Organization  AMTSO  was formed in 2008  AMTSO, 2017 . The organization exists to provide a forum to improve the process of malware identification and product testing, the  design  of  software  and  methodologies  for  analysis,  and  to  identify  standards  and practices  that  can  be  implemented  across  the  security  industry.  In  fact,  they  have published  a  range  of  documents  describing  testing  guidelines  and  standards  for  the analysis  of  malware  and  testing  of  security  products.  The  AMTSO  comprise  primarily major  security  vendors,  which  is  sensible  given  that  they  have  a  vested  interest  in developing sound products. Some have questioned whether this is a good thing, as the  175   vendors  may  have  little  interest  in  truly  assessing  the  quality  of  their  products  or revealing the limits of what their tools can do  Townsend, 2010 . Thus, the AMTSO is one of the few entities that attempts to police the antivirus industry, though there are limits to its capabilities.  176   Summary  The  threat  of  malware  is  diverse  and  ever-changing,  affecting  virtually  all  forms  of computer technology. Malicious software takes many forms, though the use of programs that blend various attack techniques into a single platform is increasingly common. The creation of malware is, however, a skill that only a few have and can implement in the wild. As a result, some have taken to selling their resources in open markets operating online, which increases the capability of less skilled attackers while enriching talented programmers.  The  criminal  laws  available  to  prosecute  malware  users  are  substantive, though  there  are  no  necessary  laws  against  actually  writing  malware.  Thus,  law enforcement agencies are not necessarily able to mitigate the threat of malware. Instead the computer security industry has generally become the pertinent resource to minimize the threat of malware for the general public, governments, and industry.

Since  malware  writers  tend  to  target  popular  software  and  resources, what do you think will be the likely targets for infection over the next five years? Please explain why you think a certain target may be selected over another.  2.  If malware markets are making it easy to obtain malware and engage in sophisticated  attacks,  what  impact  will  this  have  on  the  hacker subculture  over  time?  How  can  we  protect  networks  in  light  of  these changes?  3.  Why  do  you  think  nations  have  not  criminalized  the  creation  of malicious  software  generally?  Should  the  legal  code  be  amended  to reflect this activity? Why?  4.  If the antivirus software industry has grown since the 1990s but malware continues  to  evolve  and  expand,  is  it  reasonable  to  say  that  they  are effective in reducing infections? If vendors are not technically stopping infections, then how can we assess their real value?  178   References  AMTSO.  2017 . AMSTO website . Available at: www.amtso.org .

The ability to stream traditional terrestrial radio stations online allows individuals to access content from anywhere around the world. At the same time, streaming music services like Pandora and Spotify allow individuals to listen  to  only  the  content  they  most  prefer  and  to  share  with  friends.  Netflix,  Hulu, YouTube,  and  other  streaming  video  services  allow  individuals  to  watch  television, movies,  and  clips  on  demand.  Even  e-reader  devices  like  the  Kindle  and  Nook  tablets provide  wireless  access  to  digital  copies  of  books  and  magazines,  allowing  a  virtual library to be transported and enjoyed anywhere. All of this content may even be enjoyed via smart phone applications, meaning that you are no longer tethered to a television set in order to view certain content.  The  technologies  that  sustain  the  media-saturated  environment  we  now  live  in provide  unparalleled  access  to  any  and  all  forms  of  entertainment.  At  the  same  time, they can be readily subverted in order to acquire, copy, and unlawfully distribute media that was illegally obtained. These activities are commonly referred to as digital piracy, a form of cybercrime encompassing the illegal copying of digital media such as computer software,  digital  sound  recordings,  and  digital  video  recordings  without  the  explicit permission of the copyright holder. Digital piracy is a common form of cybercrime, so much so that between 10 and 40 percent of college students appear to have engaged in some  form  of  piracy   Gunter,  2009;  Higgins,  2006;  Higgins,  Wolfe,  and  Ricketts,  2009; Hinduja, 2003; Skinner and Fream, 1997 . In fact, one of the most unusual examples of the prevalence of pirated materials occurred in 2009 with the release of the film X-Men Origins: Wolverine  see Box 5.1 . This sci-fi action film was set to be released in the early summer in the hopes that it would be a blockbuster hit. One film critic, Roger Friedman, decided  to  publish  a  review  of  a  pirated  version  of  the  film  that  was  available  online prior  to  its  cinematic  release.  The  version  was  incomplete,  missing  many  computer- generated  elements  that  had  yet  to  be  completed,  though  Friedman  felt  that  he  could gain advantage over his peers by publishing this early review. As a consequence, he was fired and roundly criticized by the press for his efforts.  Box 5.1 Friedman Wolverine review  Fox fired up over "Wolverine" review  Friedman came under fire for posting a review of a pirated version of 20th Century Fox’s “X-Men Origins: Wolverine.” Friedman posted a review of the film Thursday, one day after an incomplete version of the  184   tentpole was leaked on the Internet.  This  article  provides  an  interesting  discussion  of  the  controversy  surrounding  a professional  film  critic’s  review  of  a  pirated  version  of  the  film  X-Men  Origins: Wolverine prior to its actual box office release. This incident highlights the problem of  digital  piracy  and  the  ethical  dilemmas  created  by  the  availability  of  pirated material.  http:  variety.com 2009 biz markets-festivals fox-fired-up-over-wolverine-review- 1118002128 .  Although  this  is  an  odd  occurrence,  Friedman’s  behavior  conforms  to  many  of  the arguments  made  by  individuals  who  frequently  pirate  materials.  Many  suggest  that downloading a movie, song, or piece of software does not cause any substantive harm because the economic loss should be relatively small by comparison to the millions or billions  of  dollars  that  are  otherwise  made.  In  fact,  the  superhero  film  The  Avengers made  over  $600  million  in  theaters,  despite  the  fact  that  several  high-quality  pirated versions of the film were available online within days of its theatrical release.  For  more  information  on  the  rates  of  software  piracy,  go  online  to: http:  globalstudy.bsa.org 2016 .  The distribution and acquisition of pirated materials has been and will continue to be a  high  concern  for  companies  due  to  their  investment  costs  to  produce  new  products. The music industry claimed a 20 percent reduction in worldwide sales between 1998 and 2002   Peitz  and  Waelbroeck,  2004 .  In  the  early  2000s,  the  International  Federation  of Phonographic Industries  2004  argued that the frequency of music piracy had increased  185   by 25 times over the previous three years.  Current  estimates  that  are  favorable  to  the  music  industry  place  the  amount  that digital  piracy  costs  the  US  music  industry  at  staggering  numbers,  possibly  about  $12.5 billion  worth  of  economic  losses  per  year,  which  would  include  71,000  jobs  and  $422 million in tax revenue  Music Business Worldwide, 2014 . It is also estimated that only about one-third of music acquired is actually paid for and that digital music piracy may take up to a quarter of the Internet bandwidth globally  17.5 percent in the USA . These estimates, however, are usually not considered to be valid outside of the music industry, as  the  estimates,  including  jobs  lost,  are  based  on  questionable  or  unprovided methodologies.  Regarding software piracy, the Business Software Alliance  BSA   2016  reports that 39 percent of software globally is pirated, down 4 percent from 2013. Evidence suggests that software piracy is especially high in low-income countries where the ability to acquire media is limited relative to its cost. The BSA suggests that piracy is highest and remains high in Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia relative to Canada, Europe, and the USA.  At the same time, piracy is not limited to individuals. The company Bitman-agement Software has filed a federal lawsuit for $600 million in damages against the United States Navy, claiming that it pirated over 558,000 copies of a virtual reality software program they produce  Kravets, 2016 . In response to the suit, the federal government indicated that it installed the software across hundreds of thousands of systems, but received no limits  as  to  how  many  machines  these  licenses  applied  to.  As  a  result,  the  software producer may be entitled to literally billions of dollars in damages under the existing US Copyright law  Kravets, 2016 .  As such, some have begun to question the value of pursuing piracy as a criminal act. If copyright  holders  still  profit  from  their  efforts  despite  individuals  being  able  to  access ideas  and  media  for  free,  can  any  harm  truly  result  from  piracy?  In  fact,  would  the ability  to  access  any  and  all  information  improve  the  open  nature  of  society  and stimulate  creativity  as  a  whole?  The  recently  formed  political  group  Pirate  Parties International  believes  that  reforming  copyright  laws  to  favor  more  open  distribution would  be  a  boon  to  society  and  foster  transparency  in  governments  across  the  world. This group has found success throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia, and may have far-reaching consequences for society over the next decade.

This chapter will provide  a  focused  discussion  of  intellectual  property  and  the  evolution  of  piracy techniques over the past 30 years. In addition, the laws and tactics used to pursue pirates internationally will be explored so that readers understand the challenges posed by this offense in a globally connected world.  187   What is intellectual property?  Before discussing piracy, it is important to understand how ideas and intellectual works are legally protected. For instance, this book has value because it is useful to readers as an  assembled  document  with  information  synthesized  from  works,  ideas,  and information that already exist. Similarly, music, movies, art, and creative endeavors all have value to their developer, as well as prospective economic value. When an original idea  that  involves  some  creative  expression  is  put  into  a  fixed  medium,  such  as  being written  down  on  paper  or  drafted  on  canvas  using  paint,  it  may  be  defined  as intellectual  property.  Ideas  become  “property”  because  they  are  physically  tangible works  that  may  be  viewed  by  others.  Thus,  any  work  of  art,  novel,  design,  blueprint, invention, or song can be intellectual property.  To protect an idea or work from being stolen, and to ensure that an individual receives appropriate credit for a creation, many people try to copyright, trademark, or patent an idea.  These  are  all  forms  of  legal  protection  for  intellectual  property  that  provide exclusive use of an idea or design to a specific person or company, the right to control how it may be used, and legal entitlement to payment for its use for a limited period of time.  For  instance,  the  logos  and  branding  for  a  product  like  Coca-Cola  or  Apple  are important  symbols  that  link  a  product  to  a  company  and  have  been  trademarked  to ensure that they are not misused by other companies or individuals for their own gain. Similarly, copyright protections are automatically granted to an individual who creates a literary, musical, or artistic work of some type from the moment it is created in a fixed format like a recording or a typed and printed medium  Yar, 2013 .  It  is  important  to  note  that  while  copyright  protections  are  available  in  a  cross- national  context,  there  is  a  distinction  with  regard  to  US  law.  Individuals  are  given copyright protections from the time a work is created, though they must register their copyright  with  the  government  to  ensure  that  they  are  given  all  necessary  protection under  the  law.  Specifically,  an  individual  can  only  pursue  criminal  or  civil  actions through the state if the content creator has acquired a registered copyright or other legal protection.  As  a  result,  legal  protection  for  intellectual  property  requires  some forethought on the part of the creators to secure their ideas in the USA.  188   For more information on copyright laws, go online to:  1.  www.copyright.gov, 2.  www.ipo.gov.uk types copy.htm.  The ability to maintain and enforce copyrights and legal protections over intellectual property in the Digital Age, however, is extremely difficult due to the transitory nature of  an  idea  and  the  ability  to  access  information  from  anywhere  at  any  given  point  in time. This is where the problem of intellectual property theft, or piracy, has emerged as a substantive economic threat to artists and copyright holders. Our ability to access any work,  be  it  cinematic,  musical,  or  literary,  through  the  Web,  television,  or  streaming media has made it much easier to reproduce works without notifying the original creator of  our  intentions.  This  means  that  copyright  holders  do  not  receive  appropriate reimbursement and must find ways to ensure that their rights are upheld. As a result, copyright  laws  have  evolved  substantially  over  the  past  30  years  to  ensure  that individuals and corporations with legal rights to a piece of intellectual property are given their  appropriate  due.  In  addition,  those  who  wish  to  circumvent  legal  protections continuously change their behaviors in order to reduce the likelihood of detection and risk of arrest.  The  evolution  of  both  piracy  and  legislation  to  protect  intellectual  property  will  be  explored in detail to contextualize the current state of this problem.  189   The evolution of piracy over time  The theft of music and video recordings existed prior to the emergence of the Internet. The  development  of  affordable  audio  and  video  recording  equipment  in  the  1970s  and 1980s enabled individuals to easily record music or videos during live concerts as well as radio and television broadcasts. For example, the audiotape allowed individuals to record songs  and  programming  on  the  radio  while  it  played  live.  This  allowed  individuals  to create  “mix  tapes”  with  content  that  was  aired  for  free.  Similarly,  the  VHS  tape  and home  video  cassette  recorder   VCR   allowed  individuals  to  record  content  from  their televisions and replay it at a time of their choosing. In turn, those with multiple VCRs could  connect  them  together  in  order  to  create  “bootleg”  tapes  by  playing  content  on their television while recording it on another VCR at the same time. This method could be applied in order to obtain free copies of films which were still prohibitively expensive for purchase, but inexpensive to rent from various retail outlets.  Moving  into  the  1990s,  the  emergence  of  the  compact  disc   CD   helped  usher  in  a change in the way in which media were recorded, formatted, and handled. Vinyl records and cassette tapes were the standard media format of choice for many; these were analog formats,  meaning  that  the  sound-waves  produced  by  musicians,  while  playing,  are reproduced in an analogous electrical signal that is then replicated into variations in the recording  medium,  such  as  the  grooves  on  a  record.  The  CD,  however,  was  a  digital medium, whereby sound-waves were converted into a sequence of numbers that were then  stored  electronically.  This  format  was  thought  to  be  of  superior  quality  to traditional analog recordings and had the potential to be much less expensive to produce than other formats. As a result, media companies could obtain a higher rate of return on investments for their intellectual property.  In  1996,  the  Motion  Picture  Experts  Group   MPEG   was  actively  working  with  the International  Organization  for  Standardization   ISO   to  develop  a  mechanism  to compress  large  audio  and  media  files  into  a  smaller  size  for  distribution  over  the Internet. Since most users at this time used dial-up Internet connectivity, the connection speeds  and  volume  of  data  that  could  be  downloaded  were  relatively  slow  and  small. Thus, they developed the MP3 format in order to compress audio files, which became the industry standard for compression and media formatting.  information  on   For  more  www.npr.org blogs therecord 2011 03 23 134622940 the-mp3-a-history-of- innovation-and-betrayal.  the  evolution  of  MP3,  go  online   to:  190   The release of the MP3 format led to the creation of MP3 players, like Winamp, for desktop  computers.  These  programs  became  extremely  popular,  and  the  first  portable MP3  player  was  produced  and  marketed  just  three  years  later,  in  1999.  In  turn, individuals  were  able  to  use  this  compression  standard  to  their  advantage  in  order  to pirate media and share it with others through various services. In fact, the production of desktop  computers  with  CD  drives  that  could  both  read  and  write  onto  CDs  made  it tremendously  easy  to  duplicate  and  pirate  materials  with  immediate  gratification  and minimal risk.  The same may be said for DVDs and BluRay media, which provide high-quality image and  sound  in  a  format  that  can  now  be  readily  cracked  and  shared.  There  are  now various  “ripping”  software  programs  that  allow  users  to  remove  Digital  Rights Management  DRM  protection from media in order to copy content to a storage device. In fact, the company 321 Studios in the USA developed a software product called DVD X Copy  that  allowed  users  to  copy  any  DVD  movie  to  a  blank  DVD   Karagiannis et al., 2004 . This program required no technical knowledge; rather, the user simply installed the software and followed the prompts in order to copy the media. An injunction was brought  against  the  company  that  forced  them  to  shut  down  the  service  in  2004,  but various  programs  are  available  that  provide  the  same  facilities.  Thus,  the  evolution  of media presentation and recording technology is innately tied to the problem of piracy.  The changing methods of pirates  The  availability  of  pirated  materials  has  been  intimately  tied  to  the  evolution  of technology and the role of computer hackers who develop tools to enable piracy. Media and  software  companies  have  always  utilized  tools  to  minimize  the  likelihood  of  their intellectual  property  being  copied.  In  fact,  hackers  in  the  early  1980s  began  to  subvert protections  on  software  in  order  to  share  programs  with  others.  The  individuals  who posted  and  shared  programs  were  commonly  referred  to  as  warez doodz,  which  is  a combination  of  the  words  “software”  and  “dudes.”  Their  warez,  or  pirated  files,  were initially distributed through password-protected BBSs, and individuals could gain status by  providing  access  to  new  or  hard-to-find  files.  Thus,  warez  doodz  were  important players in the early days of the hacker scene.  For  more  information  on  the  early  days  of  piracy,  go  online  to: http:  arstechnica.com gadgets 2014 01 modems-warez-and-ansi-art-remembering-  191   bbs-life-at-2400bps .  As  technology  became  more  user  friendly,  and  the  cost  of  Internet  connectivity decreased, warez creation and sharing became more prominent. The techniques to share files, however, began to change with innovations in technology and creative computer engineering.  For  instance,  the  risk  associated  with  sharing  cracked  or  pirated  files through  single  servers  or  web-based  repositories  increased  because  a  law  enforcement agency  could  take  out  that  one  server  and  eliminate  all  access  to  the  files.  Thus,  the development  of  various  peer-to-peer   P2P   file-sharing  protocols  in  the  late  1990s enabled file sharing directly between users, which dramatically reduced the likelihood of  detection.  For  instance,  the  development  of  IRC  channels  in  1998  allowed  users  to connect  and  communicate  with  others  in  literally  thousands  of  chatrooms  established and  run  by  various  individuals.  This  was,  and  still  is,  a  communications  vehicle  for technologically savvy users and was initially populated by those involved in the hacking and warez scenes.  The social nature of IRC coupled with its global reach led many to use it as a means to engage in direct file sharing, particularly for software and music  Cooper and Harrison, 2001 . Typically, individuals would enter a chatroom and specify what they were looking for, and a user with those materials would negotiate with that person in order to receive some  files  in  return.  The  reciprocal  relationships  that  developed  in  IRC  fostered  the formation of a piracy subculture where individuals were judged on their ability to find and access programs or files and share them with others  Cooper and Harrison, 2001 .  While  the  technical  nature  of  IRC  limited  its  use  as  a  file-sharing  service  to  more technically  literate  populations,  the  larger  population  of  Internet  users  was  able  to engage in piracy through the development of the program Napster in 1999. This freely available specialized software was developed by Shawn Fanning and others in order to provide  an  easy-to-use  program  to  share  MP3-encoded  music  files  between  computer systems.  Specifically,  a  user  needed  to  download  the  Napster  program,  which  would connect that computer to the larger network of user systems that also had the program installed. Users would then select a folder or folders they wanted to share with others, which would then be indexed onto servers maintained by the Napster Corporation. This allowed  users  within  the  network  to  quickly  identify  media  that  they  wanted  and  be directly connected to the appropriate computer to complete the download.  Napster became an extremely popular file-sharing service in a short amount of time.  192   In fact, over 2.7 billion music files were traded among Napster users in February 2001. The development and adoption of high-speed Internet connectivity for home users also stimulated involvement in piracy. Individuals could download several complete songs in the time it took to obtain one file through traditional dial-up connectivity. Thus, Napster played a pivotal role in the growth of the piracy problem.  For more information on the government debates over Napster, go online to: www.c-span.org video ?159534–1 records-v-napster.  The  popularity  of  Napster,  however,  was  stymied  by  lawsuits  brought  against  the corporation by the heavy metal band Metallica and A&M Records in 2001. These suits argued  that  the  service  was  facilitating  piracy  and  negatively  impacting  the  financial well-being  of  artists  and  recording  companies   McCourt  and  Burkart,  2003 .  These lawsuits forced Napster to become a paid service, which quickly declined in popularity. Several  other  P2P  services  quickly  took  its  place,  such  as  LimeWire  and  Kazaa,  which used similar protocols in order to connect users and distribute media.  Shortly after the decline of Napster, a new file-sharing protocol called Bit-Torrent  e merged  that  became  extremely  popular.  The  use  of  torrent-  sharing  software  allows concurrent uploads and downloads of media through multiple sources. Specifically, users must  download  a torrent client,  which  connects  them  to  the  larger  network  of  users. From  there,  a  person  can  search  for  a  piece  of  media  he  or  she  wants  to  download through various indexing services. Once they find that movie or music, they then begin to download the file by connecting to a series of user computers which have that file, referred to as “seeders.” The torrent protocol links the downloader to an indexed list of all  seeders  and  captures  bits  of  the  full  file  from  multiple  users  at  once.  This  process makes downloading much faster and decentralized in order to make it more difficult to disrupt  the  network  of  file  sharing.  As  a  result,  the  torrent  protocol  is  a  true  P2P mechanism owing to the ability to access the required file directly from dozens of users at once.  For more information on torrents, go online to: www.bittorrent.com .  193   Torrent clients became extremely popular in the mid-2000s and were thought to have accounted  for  over  half  of  all  pirated  materials  online  by  2004   Pouwelse,  Garbacki, Epema,  and  Sips,  2005 .  In  fact,  one  of  the  most  popular  resources  in  the  torrent community is The Pirate Bay   TPB ,  which  maintains  indexed  torrent  files  for  music, software, video games, and newly released movies. The group operates out of Sweden and has been in existence for years, despite being raided by police and having three of its key  operators  convicted  of  copyright  law  violations  requiring  one  year  in  jail  and millions of dollars in fines  Nhan, 2013 . As a result, torrents appear to be the latest file- sharing  mechanism  available  to  pirates   see  Box  5.2  for  details  on  the  most  common films  shared ,  though  this  may  change  in  the  next  few  years  with  innovations  in technology as a whole.  Box 5.2 These were the top-14 illegally downloaded  movies in 2015  www.businessinsider.com top-pirated-movies-2015–12.  Though the box office had a banner year in 2015, the movie business still has to vigorously combat piracy and, according to data, it’s on the rise. Variety released a list of the 14 titles that were pirated the most this year.  This  article  provides  an  overview  of  the  most  pirated  movies  based  on  a  tracking report  published  by  the  firm  Excipio.  The  results  are  surprising,  as  the  evidence suggests  that  films  released  during  the  previous  year  were  still  frequently downloaded, while rates of piracy were down.  To that end, there has been a trend in piracy practices based on the proliferation of high-speed  Internet  connectivity  and  streaming  media  consumption.  The  use  of streaming  media  services  like  Netflix,  Hulu,  and  other  applications  has  become  194   extremely  popular,  and  a  standard  way  to  consume  television  and  film  content. Interestingly, there is some evidence that pirates are now streaming pirated content to consume  it  rather  than  downloading  it  and  viewing  it  offline   MUSO,  2016 .  A  2016 report from the MUSO Corporation found that 57.84 billion visits to film and television piracy sites were to streaming sites in 2015. This figure comprised 73 percent of all visits for this form of content in their analyzed sample of over 73 billion searches across 200 million different devices  MUSO, 2016 . Direct downloads of content via torrents were still popular at 17 percent, though this figure represents a decrease from 2014. Thus, it is necessary to constantly monitor the practices of pirates as they continue to change their methods due to shifts in entertainment consumption habits and technology.  195   The subculture of piracy  Due  to  the  global  spread  of  the  Internet  and  the  diverse  nature  of  digital  media  and formats, there are now multiple piracy subcultures that may be present, consisting of:  1  persistent  downloaders  who  obtain  large  quantities  of  pirated  materials,  and   2   those who  have  the  capacity  to  create,  distribute,  and  share  pirated  materials.  Research  on persistent  pirates  suggests  that  they  place  significant  value  on  high-speed  Internet connectivity and the ability to host significant amounts of data  see Hinduja, 2001 . This is  due  to  the  main  goal  of  piracy  –  to  rapidly  disseminate  electronic  media  in  large quantities  to  people  around  the  globe   Cooper  and  Harrison,  2001 .  At  the  same  time, individuals who occasionally engage in piracy find it easier to access files when they can do so through high-speed connections  Downing, 2011; Holt and Copes, 2010 . This may account  for  the  extreme  popularity  of  sites  like  The  Pirate  Bay,  because  they  enable individuals to search through virtually any torrent for pirated material currently online. In  fact,  repeated  attempts  to  take  down  TPB  have  been  regularly  defeated,  as  the  site returns on a different web address within hours if not minutes.  Furthermore, persistent pirates appear to develop large collections of media or content in order to have complete discographies or works by an artist or television show  Cooper and Harrison, 2001; Downing, 2011 . As a result, those pirates who can share unusual or exotic  materials  with  others  are  able  to  generate  status  within  the  subculture.  Their ability to distribute these materials allows them to develop a reputation for file sharing that leads to respect from both casual and persistent pirates  Cooper and Harrison, 2001; Downing, 2011 . The desire for exotic materials may have influenced TPB’s decision to continue to host torrent files that had fewer than ten people sharing it, despite no longer hosting  torrent  files  generally  in  February  2012.  The  operators  indicated  that  they wanted to keep content available to all, regardless of the form of torrent software they used, while also keeping their own costs down  Van Der Sar, 2012 . Thus, there are some commonalities between the beliefs of persistent and casual pirates.  Within  the  existing  research  on  piracy,  there  are  a  few  specific  justifications  that pirates  use  to  support  their  behaviors,  regardless  of  the  materials  they  acquire. Specifically, the benefits of piracy are quite high, as a person can obtain what they want with  no  cost  and  minimal  risk  of  detection.  The  immediate  material  benefits  also facilitate  larger  individual  interests  in  certain  artists,  genres,  or  gaming  systems.  For instance, persistent media pirates reported that they may download a single episode of a television  show  or  piece  of  music  to  determine  if  they  enjoy  the  product   Holt  and Copes, 2010 . If they find it entertaining, then they may actually buy the full season of that show or pay for other music by an artist so that they can enjoy the product in a better  format.  Similarly,  individuals  who  pirate  older  video  games  indicate  that  their downloading  helps  maintain  their  interest  in  older  consoles  and  gaming  systems  196    Downing,  2011 .  In  fact,  Downing   2011   argues  that  video  game  piracy  may  be  a consequence of the general success and popularity of video games rather than a source of market failures.  At the same time, there are certain risks that arise as a consequence of engaging in piracy that cannot be ignored. There are clear legal risks that may come from violating copyright  laws,  such  as  fines  or  potential  arrests  depending  on  the  depth  of  one’s involvement in piracy. The decision-making processes of pirates, however, do not appear to be impacted by the deterrent influence of legal sanctions  Al-Rafee and Cronan, 2006; Gillespie, 2006; Holt and Copes, 2010 . This is clearly evident in the continuous attempts to  take  down  The  Pirate  Bay  and  other  torrent  groups.  Almost  all  of  these  sites, particularly  TPB,  persist,  suggesting  that  they  can  withstand  any  attempt  to  remove pirated content from the Internet.  Similarly, a persistent pirate noted: “I think the govt companies pick people to make an example out of them [.] I think they take someone who they know cannot pay for it or is a regular person and try to make an example out of them to scare people”  Holt and Copes, 2010: 638 . In fact, most individuals are able to justify their piracy based on the notion that they do not otherwise shoplift or steal CDs, software, and games from bricks- and-mortar  stores.  For  instance,  one  individual  involved  in  gaming  piracy  suggested, “Piracy  is  not  Theft.  It’s  piracy”   Downing,  2011:  765 .  Thus,  the  subculture  of  piracy appears to support and justify these behaviors in a variety of ways.  197   The evolution of legislation to deal with piracy  Although  digital  piracy  is  a  recent  phenomenon,  the  larger  issue  of  protection  for intellectual  property  is  relatively  old.  In  fact,  there  have  been  laws  pertaining  to copyright  in  existence  in  England  since  the  mid-1600s.  These  laws  were  primarily designed to restrict the ability to reproduce materials at a time when printed type and the  ability  to  read  were  still  highly  restricted  to  the  wealthy  classes.  As  technologies related to printing, recording, and photography evolved, so too did laws pertaining to the ownership and management of intellectual property.  The  recognition  of  a  need  for  consistent  international  protections  for  intellectual property came to the fore in the late 1800s. At that time, copyright protections were only afforded in the nation where they were published. A book published in France could be copied and sold in other countries with no concern for either the existing copyright or the author. This was particularly important owing to the differences in the Anglo-Saxon concept of “copyright” which focused on economic issues with the French concern of the “right  of  the  author.”  Thus,  nations  became  concerned  about  the  ways  in  which intellectual property would be handled and protected internationally. These concerns led to  an  international  agreement  on  copyright  laws  at  the  Berne  Convention  for  the Protection  of  Literary  and  Artistic  Works,  also  known  at  the  Berne  Convention,  in Berne,  Switzerland  in  1886.  The  original  signees  of  the  Berne  Convention  were  the United Kingdom  although much of it was not implemented in the UK until the passage of  the  Copyright,  Designs  and  Patents  Act  of  1988 ,  France,  Belgium,  Germany,  Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Haiti, Liberia, and Tunisia  WIPO, 2017a .  In  addition  to  the  important  copyright  agreements  discussed  below,  the  Berne Convention  set  up  bureaus  to  handle  various  administrative  tasks  and  to  develop protections and frameworks for intellectual property. Two of these bureaus merged and became  the  United  International  Bureaux  for  the  Protection  of  Intellectual  Property, which  later  became  the  World  Intellectual  Property  Organization   WIPO   in  1967.  In 1974, WIPO was integrated as an organization within the United Nations  WIPO, 2017b . Today, the World Intellectual Property Organization  WIPO  has 189 nation members. It is  a  self-funding  agency  of  the  United  Nations  that  provides  a  “global  forum  for intellectual property services, policy, information and cooperation”  WIPO, 2017b . Their mission is “to lead the development of a balanced and effective international intellectual property  IP  system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all”  WIPO, 2017b .  The  Berne  Convention’s  primary  focus  was  to  protect  authors’  works  and  rights  by ensuring that copyright laws of one nation were recognized and applied in other places  WIPO,  2017a .  It  accomplished  this  by  focusing  on  three  basic  principles.  The  first principle is the principle of national treatment, which states that works created in any of  198   the signatory nations must be afforded the same protection as that of works originating in that nation. Second, the principle of automatic protection states that protection must not  be  conditioned  upon  compliance  with  any  formality.  This  means  that  works  are automatically protected when they are “fixed,” or recorded on a physical medium, and that  authors  must  not  be  required  to  register  their  work.  Third,  the  principle  of independence  of  protection  holds  that  protection  is  independent  of  any  existence  of protection in the work’s country of origin  WIPO, 2017a .  In addition, the Berne Convention provided the minimum standard of protection that must  exist  to  protect  authors’  works  and  rights.  For  instance,  Article  2 1   of  the Convention  holds  that  protections  have  to  be  made  for  all  works,  including  “every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever the mode or form of its expression.” In addition, the following rights were recognized as exclusive rights of authorization:   1   the  right  to  translate;   2   the  right  to  make  adaptations  and arrangements of the work;  3  the right to perform in public dramatic, dramatico-musical and  musical  works;   4   the  right  to  recite  literary  work  in  public;   5   the  right  to communicate to the public the performance of such works;  6  the right to broadcast; and  7   the  right  to  use  the  work  as  a  basis  for  an  audiovisual  work,  and  the  right  to reproduce, distribute, perform in public, or communicate to the public that audiovisual work.  Finally,  the  Convention  provided  for  “moral  rights,”  meaning  that  authors  have the  right  to  claim  ownership  of  their  work  and  object  to  any  action  that  may  be considered prejudicial to the author’s reputation  WIPO, 2017a .  The Berne Convention also clarified the duration of the copyright protection. For most works,  the  general  rule  is  that  protections  be  granted  until  50  years  after  the  author’s death. There are several exceptions. For example, anonymous work is protected for 50 years  after  the  work  was  lawfully  made  available  to  the  public  unless  the  author’s identity becomes known, in which case the general rule would apply. Audiovisual work must be protected for a minimum of 50 years after being made available to the public, or, if never released, 50 years after being created. Applied art and photographic works must be  protected  for  a  minimum  of  25  years  after  the  work  was  created   WIPO,  2017a . Finally,  copyrighted  work  cannot  be  protected  longer  internationally  than  it  is  in  the country of origin, referred to as the “rule of the shorter term.”  Although the Berne Convention concluded in 1886, it was later revised in 1896 in Paris and  in  1908  in  Berlin,  finally  being  completed  in  Berne  in  1914.  The  Convention continued  to  see  many  revisions  and  amendments  over  the  next  century,  as  it  was revised  in  1928   Rome ,  1948   Brussels ,  1967   Stockholm ,  and  in  1971   Paris ,  and amended in 1979. The Appendix to the Paris Act of the Convention importantly allowed developing  countries  to  translate  and  reproduce  works  in  certain  cases  connected  to education  WIPO, 2017a .  As of the end of 2016, 172 nations were parties to the Berne Convention. The scope of the  Berne  Convention,  however,  is  much  greater.  All  members  of  the  World  Trade Organization who are not party to the Berne Convention are still bound by the principles of the Berne Convention under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual  199   Property  Rights   TRIPS  Agreement ,  although  they  are  not  bound  to  the  moral  rights provisions of the Convention  WIPO, 2017a .  The  United  States,  however,  did  not  enter  into  force  in  the  Berne  Convention  until 1989. The USA’s primary concern with ratifying the treaty was its reluctance to change its copyright laws which require copyright works to be registered. The USA had instead ratified  other  Conventions  throughout  the  twentieth  century,  such  as  the  Universal Copyright Convention in 1952, to address some of the other issues regarding copyrights. Even with the USA ratifying the Berne Convention, citizens who create a work that they want to be protected in US courts have to obtain a copyright within the USA to ensure they receive equal protection under the law. For instance, if a US citizen or organization develops intellectual property and feels that their idea has been infringed, they cannot legally file suit unless they have received a copyright there  Brenner, 2011 .  The  USA  has  had  criminal  penalties  for  the  infringement  of  protected  intellectual property,  however,  since  1909   Copyright  Act  of  1909 .  Interestingly,  the  USA  also removed the power to prosecute copyright infringement cases from state courts in 1976 with  the  introduction  of  the  revised  Copyright  Act  of  1976,  which  introduced  new criminal  sanctions  under  Titles  17  and  18  of  the  US  Criminal  Code   Brenner,  2011 . Currently,  the  most  stringent  legal  statutes  in  the  US  pertaining  to  copyright infringement are contained under Title 17 of the US Criminal Code  506 , which make it a  federal  crime  for  someone  to  willfully  infringe  an  existing  copyright  for  either commercial  advantage,  private  gain,  or  by  reproducing  or  distributing  one  or  more copies of a copyrighted work with a value of more than $1,000 during a 180-day period  Brenner, 2011 . In fact, distributing or reproducing one or more copyrighted works with a value of at least $1,000 during a 180-day period can lead to misdemeanor charges. A felony charge requires that a person reproduce or distribute at least ten copies of one or more  copyrighted  works  with  a  total  value  of  more  than  $2,500  within  180  days  Brenner, 2011 . As such, persistent pirates would be more likely prosecuted with felony charges, such as the members of The Pirate Bay.  This  statute  is  commonly  used  to  prosecute  software  piracy  due  to  the  high  costs associated with certain forms of commercial software. For instance, a single copy of the popular  media  manipulation  software  Photoshop  can  cost  $599  off  the  shelf.  Thus,  an individual  who  makes  two  copies  of  this  program  could  easily  be  charged  with  a misdemeanor  under  this  law.  The  low  cost  of  music  and  movies  makes  it  much  more difficult to successfully prosecute an individual under these statutes due to the massive volume of materials they would have to reproduce.  Even with the multiple revisions to the Berne Convention over the twentieth century, copyright owners did not feel that the Convention appropriately protected the rights of authors  in  a  new  digital  age.  Thus,  the  WIPO  Copyright  Treaty   WCT   was  passed  in 1996 and entered into force in 2002 to provide further copyright protections to two types of  works:   1   computer  programs;  and   2   databases,  or  compilations  or  data  or  other material,  in  which  the  selection  or  arrangement  of  the  contents  constitute  intellectual creations  WIPO, 2017c .  200   The  WIPO  Copyright  Treaty  also  granted  three  additional  rights  to  authors:   1  distribution,   2   rental,  and   3   communication  to  the  public.  The  right  of  distribution includes the authorization to make available to the public the original and copies of the work  through  either  sale  or  transfer  of  ownership.  The  right  of  rental  provides authorization  for  the  owner  to  rent  to  the  public  the  original  and  copies  of  computer programs,  cinematographic  work,  and  works  embodied  in  phonograms.  The  right  of communication to the public includes the right to authorize any communication to the public, regardless of it being wired or not, to allow the public access to the work from any place at any time, such as on-demand and interactive services.  Consistent with the Berne Convention, the duration of these rights must be protected  for at least 50 years for any work. The treaty also required the signatories to:  provide legal remedies against the circumvention of technological measures  e.g., encryption  used by authors in connection with the exercise of their rights, and against the removal or altering of information, such certain data that identify works or their authors, necessary for the management  e.g., licensing, collecting and distribution of royalties  of their rights  “rights management information” .   WIPO, 2017c   The  WIPO  Copyright  Treaty  was  implemented  in  the  USA  via  the  passage  of  the Digital  Millennium  Copyright  Act   DMCA   and  in  the  European  Union  by  Decision 2000 278 EC,  more  specifically  Directive  91 250 EC   covering  software  copyright protection , Directive 96 9 EC  database copyright protection , and Directive 2001 29 EC  prohibition of circumventing devices .  Media  conglomerates  began  to  pressure  the  US  Congress  in  the  1990s  to  change existing  copyright  laws  and  increase  protections  for  intellectual  property.  Their  efforts led  to  the  creation  of  several  laws,  including  the  No  Electronic  Theft   NET   Act  of 1997,  which  increased  the  penalties  for  the  duplication  of  copyrighted  materials  Brenner,  2011 .  Specifically,  this  law  revised  the  language  of  the  copyright  act  to recognize infringement when an individual receives or expects to receive a copyrighted work,  including  through  electronic  means,  regardless  of  whether  they  receive commercial or private financial gain. Up until this point, criminal infringement had to involve some sort of economic advantage. Thus, the expected receipt of uploaded and  or downloaded copyrighted materials online was made illegal, making it possible to pursue individuals who acquired pirated materials through file sharing rather than paying for these  items   Brenner,  2011 .  In  addition,  these  revisions  introduced  sanctions  for  the reproduction or distribution of one or more copies of “phonorecords,” making it possible to legally pursue music piracy. Finally, the Act increased the penalties for piracy to up to five  years  in  prison  and  $250,000  in  fines,  and  increased  the  statutory  damages  that copyright holders could receive.  Shortly after the adoption of the NET Act, the US Congress also approved the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  DMCA  in 1998  Brenner, 2011 . This law was designed to directly  affect  media  piracy  online  through  further  revisions  to  the  Copyright  Act. Specifically, this law extended protection to various music and performances that have been recorded in some fashion. The second section under this title added section 1201 to  201   the Copyright Act, making it illegal to circumvent any protective technologies placed on copyrighted  works,  and  section  1202  making  it  illegal  to  tamper  with  copyright management  software  or  protections   Brenner,  2011 .  While  this  law  was  intended  to apply to computer software, it may be extended to DVDs and music with protections on the  disc  that  provide  a  modicum  of  protection  from  infringement  or  copy.  Criminal sanctions for these behaviors were also added under section 1204 of the Copyright Act.  Title  II  of  the  DMCA  is  entitled  the  Online  Copyright  Infringement  Liability Limitation Act, which gives extended protections to ISPs against copyright infringement liability  Brenner, 2011 . In order to qualify for these protections, ISPs must block access to infringing materials or remove them from their systems once a complaint is received from  a  copyright  holder  or  their  agent.  This  Title  also  enables  copyright  holders  to subpoena ISPs for the IP addresses, names, and home addresses of customers who have engaged  in  the  distribution  of  copyrighted  materials   Brenner,  2011 .  These  changes enabled copyright holders to pursue civil or criminal suits against those sharing pirated materials  with  others,  rather  than  the  services  making  it  possible  to  engage  in  file sharing overall.  legal  protection   While  US  laws  may  seem  particularly  punitive,  European  legislation  is  equally punitive in some cases. For instance, the European Union also has a series of directives designed  to  protect  intellectual  property  in  various  forms.  European Union Directive 91 250 EEC 2009 24 EC  provides  for  computer  programs  and harmonized copyright protection across the EU. This Directive was first implemented in 1991  and  afforded  copyright  protection  to  computer  programs  in  the  same  way  as literary works, such as books or poems. The Directive also gives the copyright owner the right  to  temporary  or  permanent  copying  of  the  program,  any  translations  of  the program, or the right to distribute it by any means. The life of the copyright extends for the lifetime of the software creator plus 50 years, though it has been extended to 70 years through  a  subsequent  Directive  in  2009.  This  Directive  also  affords  the  person purchasing software the right to back up the software for their personal use, though they must  have  a  license  for  the  program  itself.  Similar  protections  are  also  afforded  to databases of distinct information under Directive 96 9 EC.  In  addition,  European  Union  Directive  2001 29 EC,  or  the  Copyright  Directive, establishes guidelines concerning the adequate legal protection of copyrighted materials through  technological  means.  This  Directive  defines  rights  to  copyright  holders, including the right to reproduce their materials, and to make them available to the public through  publication  and  transmission  of  products  over  the  Internet,  including  music, media,  and  software.  This  Directive  also  requires  all  Member  States  to  provide  legal protections  against  attempts  to  circumvent  technologies  that  prevent  copying  of intellectual property and databases. In addition, Member States must provide protection against products and services designed to circumvent protective measures on intellectual property for illegal purposes or limited commercial goals. As a result of this language, this Directive is more stringent than the US DMCA.  Not  all  nations  share  these  punitive  sanctions,  as  is  evident  in  India  which  is  a  202   member  of  the  Berne  Convention  but  not  in  the  WIPO  Copyright  Treaty.  Indian copyright  law  provides  similar  protective  structures  for  copyright  holders  as  the  USA and the EU, but it is less restrictive for some forms of media and intellectual works. For instance,  a  suit  was  brought  to  the  Delhi  High  Court  by  multiple  academic  publishers against  a  copyshop  at  Delhi  University  because  it  was  selling  photocopies  of  textbook chapters  directly  to  students   Masnick,  2016 .  The  Court  ruled  that  there  had  been  no copyright  infringement  against  the  publishers  because  copyright  law  does  not  provide the creator of intellectual property with ownership, but rather to “stimulate activity and progress in the arts for intellectual enrichment of the public [.] and not to impede the harvest  of  knowledge”   Masnick,  2016 .  Thus,  the  use  of  copier  technology,  which  is available in libraries as well as cell phone cameras and other equipment readily available to students, constituted fair use of their intellectual property.  203   The law enforcement and industry response  Although  there  are  myriad  laws  designed  to  protect  intellectual  property,  there  are relatively  few  law  enforcement  agencies  that  pursue  cases  against  those  who  pirate materials. For instance, the USA removed the power to prosecute copyright infringement cases from state courts in 1976 with the introduction of the revised Copyright Act of 1976  Brenner,  2011 .  As  a  result,  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation   FBI   tends  to prosecute active investigations against piracy groups  Haberman, 2010 . In addition, the U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection   CBP   and  Immigration  and  Customs Enforcement   ICE   investigate  and  seize  imported  goods  that  infringe  existing intellectual property rights. This includes digital transfers of pirated goods, as individuals who attempt to bring these materials from outside servers onto their home computer are technically  importing  pirated  goods   Haberman,  2010 .  These  three  agencies  have operated  in  concert  to  take  down  various  groups  and  individuals  involved  in  the distribution  of  pirated  materials,  for  example,  in  Operation  Buccaneer  in  2001.  This investigation affected 62 people involved in software piracy in six countries as part of the piracy ring DrinkorDie  Nhan, 2013 .  Similarly,  the  City  of  London  Police  has  launched  the  Police  Intellectual  Property Crime Unit  PIPCU  in order to investigate and handle various forms of piracy  City of London,  2013 .  This  unit  works  as  an  independent  group  designed  to  handle  serious forms of intellectual property crime, including counterfeit products and pirated materials online  and  offline.  Its  goal  is  to  integrate  with  various  international  enforcement  and industry agencies and become a hub for investigations to disrupt organized piracy and fraud, as well as develop strategies to deter and reduce piracy generally  City of London, 2013 .  One  of  the  greatest  challenges  law  enforcement  agencies  face  in  dealing  with intellectual  property  laws  is  the  fact  that  it  is  exceedingly  difficult  for  intellectual property owners to identify when and how their materials are shared illegally. Copyright holders  must  scour  sites  across  the  globe  in  order  to  locate  distribution  networks  and participants.  As  a  consequence,  industry  groups  play  a  more  prominent  role  in  the enforcement of intellectual property rights. They manage and  promote  the  interests  of major  corporations  and  copyright  holders  within  their  country,  as  well  as internationally. For instance, the Recording Industry Association of America  RIAA  is  a  trade  organization  that  supports  the  recording  industry  and  those  businesses  that create, manufacture, or distribute legally sold and recorded music within the USA. The group was founded in 1952, helped define standards related to music production, and is a broker for the collective rights management of sound recordings. In fact, its stated goals are to:  1  protect intellectual property rights and the First Amendment rights of artists;  2  perform research about the music industry; and  3  monitor and review relevant laws,  204   regulations, and policies. Currently the RIAA represents over 1,600 recording companies and  other  industries,  such  as  Sony  Music  Entertainment  and  Warner  Music  Group  Brenner, 2011 .  For  more  information  on  industry  bodies  protecting  intellectual  property,  go online to:  1.  www.riaa.com, 2.  www.iprcenter.gov.  There are many other groups, such as the Motion Picture Association of America  MPAA ,  that  operate  to  protect  the  intellectual  property  of  their  artists  and  creative producers. In the UK, the Federation Against Copyright Theft  FACT  is the primary trade organization dedicated to the protection and management of intellectual property, notably those of film and television producers. The group was established in 1983 and is actively  engaged  with  law  enforcement  to  combat  piracy.  For  instance,  FACT  works regularly with the UK police to take down piracy websites and sue groups engaged in the distribution or facilitation of digital piracy  FACT, 2013 . They also work in conjunction with  the  Australian  Federation  Against  Copyright  Theft   AFACT ,  which  targets pirates in Australia and Oceania generally  AFACT, 2013 . Similarly, the Indian Music Industry   IMI   represents  recording  industry  distributors  and  producers  across  the nation  IMI, 2016 .  All  of  these  entities  work  in  concert  to  pursue  and  protect  their  economic  and intellectual  interests.  This  is  a  substantive  challenge  in  the  current  international landscape,  as  the  laws  of  one  country  governing  intellectual  property  may  be  entirely different than those of another nation. Consider TPB, the aforementioned group central in the distribution of torrent files, which was founded in Sweden in 2003. Although the  205   members  assumed  they  would  be  safe  from  law  enforcement  efforts,  several  of  their homes were raided and they were prosecuted by Swedish and US law enforcement for facilitating the distribution of pirated materials. In an effort to avoid future incidents, the group attempted to purchase Sealand, a micro-island off the coast of England. The group raised  $25,000  in  donations  to  facilitate  this  endeavor,  operating  under  the  assumption that they could turn the island into a safe haven for pirated materials. This attempt was unsuccessful, as the Government of Sealand felt that the group was only going to violate international  laws.  Their  efforts,  however,  demonstrate  the  extent  to  which  piracy groups are organizing and attempting to avoid legal efforts.  The  recording  industry  also  pursues  civil  suits  against  various  individuals  and businesses  for  their  role  in  the  facilitation  of  piracy.  For  instance,  the  music  industry sued  the  file-sharing  service  Napster  over  their  role  in  the  distribution  of  pirated materials, which led to an out-of-court settlement and the shuttering of Napster as a free service.  The  recording  industry  also  began  to  sue  individual  pirates  for  their downloading behaviors, which often involved hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines against the pirates. This tactic, however, has been largely abandoned in favor of tracking file-sharing  programs  to  detect  torrent  seeders.  In  turn,  they  work  with  ISPs  to  send cease-and-desist  letters  in  order  to  help  slow  down  the  volume  of  pirated  materials traded online. In fact, the RIAA and FACT began to distribute letters to Internet users who  were  thought  to  have  engaged  in  illegal  file  sharing  to  demand  payment  in settlement  for  their  copyright  violations   Nhan,  2013 .  This  tactic  was  thought  to  be  a way  to  directly  reduce  the  legal  costs  these  entities  incurred  as  a  result  of  pursuing settlements against file sharing.  Other  nations  have  pursued  options  to  directly  limit  individuals’  access  to  pirated content online. For instance, India began to allow ISPs to block access to websites where individuals could acquire pirated media beginning in 2011  ONI, 2012 . The blocks were often selective and developed on the basis of so-called John Doe orders, where an entity could claim that unknown individuals would cause harm to their intellectual property or copyright  Anwer, 2016 . The identification of sites was also questionable as they were developed by attorneys working for industry groups such as the Indian Music Industry. As a result, entire sites would be blocked, not just a single URL where content could be identified. They were not also enforced across all ISPs, causing gaps in enforcement.  In 2012, the Madras High Court ordered that only specific URLs could be blocked and not entire websites in an attempt to minimize free use of the Internet by citizens. This was challenged, however, by a 2014 request from Sony Entertainment which ordered the court to allow fully blocking of various file-sharing and hosting sites that could enable the  distribution  of  pirated  material.  The  court  ruled  in  favor  of  Sony  and  eventually allowed 219 sites to be blocked entirely. In 2015, the IMI group was able to successfully argue that ISPs across the nation block access to sites that enable media piracy  Collier, 2015 .  The  Delhi  High  Court  instructed  all  the  ISPs  in  the  nation  to  block  users  from accessing  104  different  websites  identified  by  the  IMI  as  a  source  for  pirated  content  Collier,  2015 .  If  an  individual  attempted  to  access  such  a  site  via  their  web  browser,  206   they would see the following message:  This URL has been blocked under the instructions of the Competent Government Authority or in compliance with the orders of a Court of competent jurisdiction. Viewing, downloading, exhibiting or duplicating an illicit copy  of  the  contents  under  this  URL  is  punishable  as  an  offence  under  the  laws  of  India,  including  but  not limited to under Sections 63, 63-A, 65 and 65-A of the Copyright Act, 1957 which prescribe imprisonment for 3 years and also fine of up to Rs. 3,00,000 -. Any person aggrieved by any such blocking of this URL may contact at urlblock [at] tatacommunications [dot] com who will, within 48 hours, provide you the details of relevant proceedings  under  which  you  can  approach  the  relevant  High  Court  or  Authority  for  redressal  of  your grievance.  There  has  been  substantive  criticism  of  this  strategy  across  India  for  numerous reasons.  Specifically,  the  basis  for  blocking  may  include  something  as  simple  as  the appearance of the name of a piece of copyrighted material in the URL  Anwer, 2016 . In the  case  of  full  site  blocks,  the  list  could  extend  beyond  traditional  illegal  file-sharing sites like The Pirate Bay and include sites like Google. Should an individual receive an alert message that content has been blocked due to potential pirated material, it may not be  because  they  were  actually  attempting  to  access  illegal  content.  Telling  the  person that  they  could  be  arrested  may  be  useful  information  but  is  also  a  relatively  empty threat due to the difficulty of prosecuting that individual  Anwer, 2016 . Furthermore, a person  could  easily  use  proxy  services,  such  as  Tor,  in  order  to  mask  their  physical location and gain access to pirated content. Thus, blocking content from Internet users is a somewhat questionable tactic to affect piracy rates.  Box 5.3 Torrent downloads: Fiasco over three-year jail  term shows absurdity of India's John Doe orders  http:  indiatoday.intoday.in technology story the-3-years-jail-fiasco-for-torrents- shows-absurdity-of-indias-john-doe-orders 1 745886.html.  So, can you land up in jail for viewing a torrent site in India or not? Yesterday, IndiaToday.In reported that you  may  get  a  jail  term  as  well  as  may  have  to  pay  a  fine  of  Rs3,000,000  if  you  visit  a  blocked  URL, including a torrent site. Today, you must have seen reports that no, you won’t be jailed just because you visit a torrent site.  This article provides an overview of the issues present in India’s decision to block pirated  content,  and  the  questionable  legal  grounds  on  which  potential  offenders may stand.  207   The recording and media industries have also employed unique extra-legal attempts to affect piracy networks. For instance, some private companies have been hired to disrupt file-sharing processes by “poisoning” torrent files to either corrupt content, identify the downloaders,  or  disrupt  P2P  networks  generally   Kresten,  2012 .  Some  of  the  more common methods involve attempting to share a corrupted version of a piece of music or media to deter users from downloading the file or making it more difficult to identify the actual  content.  Alternatively,  some  companies  such  as  MediaDefender  will  attempt  to share a file that tries to download content from non-existent peers or false sites in order to deter offenders  Kresten, 2012 .  More extreme measures have been employed by various companies in order to disrupt P2P  sharing  groups.  In  2010,  multiple  Indian  film  studios  hired  the  company  Aiplex Software to engage in DDoS attacks against websites like The Pirate Bay that would not respond  to  take-down  notices  to  remove  pirated  movies  they  had  produced   Whitney, 2010 . These tactics were largely ineffectual at disrupting piracy networks and actually led to a backlash by members of both the piracy and hacker subculture  Whitney, 2010 . Members  of  the  group  Anonymous  engaged  in  a  number  of  denial-of-service  attacks against  recording  artists,  companies,  and  the  RIAA  website  in  order  to  protest  their efforts  to  stop  piracy   Whitney,  2010 .  The  attack,  referred  to  as  Operation  Payback, effectively knocked critical websites offline and slowed email traffic, making it difficult for these groups to engage in regular commerce  Nhan, 2013 . As a result, there has been a reduction in the use of these extra-legal methods by the recording industry to avoid further embarrassment.  208   Summary  Taken as a whole, the problem of piracy is extremely complicated. Individuals interested in obtaining copyright-protected materials without paying for them have used a variety of  ways  to  acquire  these  goods,  though  it  has  become  increasingly  easy  to  acquire pirated materials over the past two decades. The emergence of the Internet and digital media  has  made  it  easy  for  individuals  to  share  media,  though  pirates  have  subverted these  technologies  to  share  copyrighted  files.  As  a  consequence,  it  is  extremely challenging to affect the rates of piracy through traditional measures such as lawsuits or arrests. In fact, as copyright holders continuously adapt legal strategies to deter pirates, the  piracy  subculture  is  increasingly  vocal  about  their  right  to  have  access  to  digital media of all sorts. This tension cannot be easily solved, especially as technologies that increasingly  provide  access  to  digital  materials,  such  as  the  Kindle,  rise  in  popularity. Therefore, the criminal justice response to piracy will continue to evolve over the next decade.

Consumers can now acquire virtually any item from anywhere in the world through major online retailers, like Amazon, or directly from other consumers via eBay  and  craigslist.  PWC’s   2016   survey  of  23,000  shoppers  in  25  different  countries found that over half  54%  of the respondents bought products online at least monthly. One-third of the respondents believed that their mobile phone would become their main purchasing  tool.  In  the  USA,  two-thirds  of  adults  who  use  the  Internet  shop  online  at least once each month; one-third shop online weekly  Mintel, 2015 . Similarly, 77 percent of UK Internet users purchased something online in 2015  Twenga, 2016 . Much of this expansion stems from the belief that consumers can save money and actively research products and price points by purchasing goods through online retailers  Wilson, 2011 . At the same time, consumers often increase the size of their orders and spend more to get the benefit of free shipping  Mintel, 2015 . Thus, there has been a significant increase in the use of websites and online auction houses to identify goods and services at lower price points than are otherwise available in bricks-and-mortar stores.  For  more  www.internetretailer.com trends consumers .  information  on  consumer  shopping  trends,  go  online  to:  Consumers also invest a great deal of trust in the safety and security of online retailers to  manage  their  financial  data.  Services  like  Amazon  and  iTunes  store  credit  or  debit card information on file so that customers can pay for an item through a single click in order to minimize the processing time required to pay for a product. Others use third- party payment systems like PayPal to send and receive payments for services rendered. As a result, web-based financial transactions have become commonplace in the modern world.  The ability to access and buy goods anywhere at any time represents a revolution in commerce. The benefits of these technological achievements, however, are balanced by  215   the  increasing  ease  with  which  our  personal  information  may  be  compromised.  The paperless  nature  of  many  transactions  means  that  we  must  now  put  our  trust  in companies  to  maintain  the  confidential  nature  of  our  financial  data  from  hackers  and data  thieves.  At  the  same  time,  consumers  have  to  be  vigilant  against  deceptive advertisements for products that are either too inexpensive or lucrative to miss.  In fact, one of the most commonly reported forms of cybercrime are forms of cyber- deception and theft, otherwise known as fraud. Although there are many definitions of fraud, one of the most commonly accepted involves the criminal acquisition of money or property from victims through the use of deception or cheating  e.g. Baker and Faulkner, 2003 . Various forms of fraud existed prior to the Internet and required some interaction between  the  victim  and  the  offender,  either  through  face-to-face  meetings   Kitchens, 1993;  Knutson,  1996   or  telephone-based  exchanges   Stevenson,  1998 .  As  technology, such  as  email  and  web  pages,  became  more  popular,  fraudsters  began  to  adapt  their schemes  to  suit  online  environments  where  less  direct  interaction  with  victims  was necessary to draw in prospective targets. In fact, some forms of fraud require virtually no interaction  with  a  victim,  as  criminals  can  now  compromise  databases  of  sensitive information in order to steal identities or hijack payment providers in order to illegally transfer funds.

Fraudsters  can  utilize email, texts, instant messaging systems, Facebook, Twitter, and online retailing sites to capitalize  on  unsuspecting  victims.  Some  offenders  have  even  begun  to  track  the behavior  of  naïve  individuals  to  obtain  sensitive  information.  For  instance,  teens  and young adults have begun a dangerous habit of posting pictures of new drivers’ licenses, passports, and credit  debit cards online to brag to friends  see Box 6.1 for details . In this case, the victims are providing their personally identifiable information to others freely, which may then be used to engage in identity crimes with some ease. As a result, this  216   www.slate.com blogs browbeat 2012 07 06 debit_card_pictures_on_twitter_the_hilarious_new_twitter_account_that_shames_people_for_posting_their_debit_cards_.html  presents an immediate and simple resource for fraud based solely on the poor personal security habits of users.  Box 6.1 Follow Friday: where debit card numbers get  stolen  Who tweets their debit card number?  Enter @NeedADebitCard, a new Twitter account that’s either a service for sense-deprived people, a boon for  identity  thieves,  or  sadistic  public  shaming,  depending  on  your  point  of  view.  “Please  quit  posting pictures of your debit cards, people,” its bio implores.  This  article  summarizes  a  unique  and  unusual  phenomenon:  individuals  posting their personal details for others to see via social media. The cultural imperative to post information and the potential harm that may result are discussed.  This chapter will provide an overview of the most common forms of fraud employed online, most notably those sent via email to wide audiences. The utility of e-commerce sites for the sale of counterfeit goods and the theft of sensitive personal information for identity crimes will also be examined in detail. We will also consider the difficulty law enforcement  agencies  face  in  attempting  to  combat  these  crimes,  due  in  part  to  their international scope.  217   Fraud and computer-mediated communications  When discussing online fraud, it is important to note that email is a critical resource for fraudsters. Prior to the World Wide Web and CMCs, scammers had to depend on their ability to craft convincing stories, whether in person or through either phone-based or print  scams  in  magazines  and  newspapers.  These  efforts  required  some  degree  of investment on the part of the scammer, as they had to develop and pay for an ad to be created or pay for bulk mail. In fact, some of the most well-known email scams today were  previously  run  through  handwritten  letters  in  postal  mail  or  faxes  in  the  1980s  United States Department of State, 1997 .  The creation and proliferation of email was a boon to scammers, as they could use this medium in order to access millions of prospective victims simultaneously at virtually no cost  Wall, 2004 . The use of email is ubiquitous; many people have multiple accounts at their disposal for different purposes. Email is extremely simple to use, requires virtually no cost for users or senders, and allows the distribution of images, text, web links, and attachments. This enables a scammer to create convincing messages using branded, well- known images that can fool even the most careful of users. For instance, if individuals wanted  to  create  an  email  that  appeared  to  come  from  a  bank,  they  could  visit  that institution’s website to download the official logos and language posted in order to craft a more realistic message. They can also use HTML redirects that would not otherwise be noticed by a casual web user in order to make a more believable message.  In  much  the  same  way,  fraudsters  have  begun  to  sell  counterfeit  clothing  or pharmaceuticals  to  unsuspecting  victims  via  spam  email   Holt  and  Graves,  2007;  King and Thomas, 2009; Taylor, Fritsch, Liederbach, and Holt, 2010; Wall, 2004; Wood, 2004 . Spammers  can  create  ads  for  online  retail  spaces  or  post  ads  on  craigslist  and  eBay selling  high-value  consumer  items,  such  as  Coach®  purses,  Cartier®  watches,  and prescription  pharmaceutical  drugs  like  Viagra,  at  a  dramatically  reduced  price  Balsmeier,  Bergiel,  and  Viosca  Jr.,  2004 .  Victims  of  these  spam  emails  are  sent  what looks  like  a  legitimate  advertisement  for  the  desired  product,  including  legitimate branding  logos  and  images.  The  virtual  nature  of  online  retail  makes  it  virtually impossible for the consumer to determine the validity of a claim because they cannot see the  packaging  or  inspect  the  quality  of  an  item  in  person.  Consumers  who  purchase items  may  receive  a  fraudulent  product  as  with  purses  or  jewelry,  or  adulterated products  in  the  case  of  pharmaceuticals  which  may  contain  few,  if  any,  active ingredients  Balsmeier et al., 2004; Wall and Large, 2010 .  In 2015, the Internet Crime Complaint Center  IC3   2015  received 288,012 complaints about  various  forms  of  Internet  fraud.  Approximately  44  percent  of  these  complaints reported losses of $1 billion. Based on these estimates, the average loss to these victims was  $8,421.  When  estimating  the  average  loss  for  all  victims,  regardless  of  reported  218   losses,  the  average  loss  was  $3,718   median  of  $560 .  Despite  these  estimates, approximately  15  percent  of  Internet  fraud  victims  reported  their  losses  to  law enforcement.  information   For  more  online  www.telegraph.co.uk motoring news i0869408 0nline-fraud-costs-car-buyers- 17.8million-a-year.html.  statistics,   fraud   on   go   to:  219   Identity theft  In addition to economic losses stemming from fraud, there is a tremendous threat posed by  the  loss  of  sensitive,  personally  identifiable  information   PII ,  or  the  unique identifiers which individuals use in their daily lives  Krebs, 2011 . A range of personal details  are  considered  PII,  including  names  and  birthdates,  as  well  as  government identification  numbers  assigned  to  you,  such  as  social  security  numbers,  passport numbers, and drivers’ license numbers. This information is inherently valuable, since it serves  as  the  basis  for  obtaining  credit  cards,  mortgages,  loans,  and  government assistance  Federal Trade Commission, 2016 . Criminals who obtain this information can use it to apply fraudulently for such services. In addition, they may use this information to  create  fraudulent  identification  in  order  to  conceal  their  identities  or  evade  law enforcement.  to: For  more  www.ft.com cms s 2 927ca86e-d29b-11e2-88ed-00144feab7de.htmlaxzz33UytNvd7.  the  value  of  your  PII,  go  online   information  on   The use of PII to engage in fraud or impersonation has led to a unique set of terms in the  legal  and  academic  fields:  identity  theft  and  fraud.  These  terms  are  often  used interchangeably,  though  their  use  varies  by  place.  In  addition,  there  is  no  single definition  for  either  term   Copes  and  Vieraitis,  2009 .  There  are,  however,  some consistencies  in  their  meaning.  One  of  the  most  widely  recognized  and  accepted definitions  of identity theft  in  the  USA  involves  the  unlawful  use  or  possession  of  a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit, aid, or abet illegal activity   Allison,  Schuck,  and  Learsch,  2005;  Copes  and  Vieraitis,  2009 .  The  Bureau  of Justice Statistics defines identity theft as:  the attempted or successful misuse of an existing account, such as a debit or credit card account, the misuse of personal  information  to  open  a  new  account  or  the  misuse  of  personal  information  for  other  fraudulent purposes,  such  as  obtaining  government  benefits  or  providing  false  information  to  police  during  a  crime  or traffic stop.   Harrell, 2014   220   In Australia, India, and the UK, the term identity fraud  is  more  commonly  used  to reference  when  someone  else’s  personal  information  is  used  by  another  individual  in order to obtain money, credit, goods, or services, and may be used to enable other forms of fraud, such as mortgage fraud  National Fraud Authority, 2013 . In fact, this creates an interesting dichotomy: possession of PII without authorization from those persons is not illegal in the UK, though it is in the USA.  Over  the  past  decade,  evidence  suggests  that  identity  crimes  are  increasing exponentially and cause substantive economic harm. Almost 400,000 individuals reported complaints of identity theft to the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  in 2016, comprising 13  percent  of  all  complaints  received   Federal  Trade  Commission,  2016 .  The  most common forms of identity theft reported were: employment or tax-related fraud  34% , credit card fraud  33% , phone or utilities fraud, including both fraudulent use of mobile and landline accounts  13% , and bank fraud  12% . Only 27 percent of victims reported their  experiences  to  law  enforcement  which  is  surprisingly  low,  given  the  economic consequences of these crimes.  The number of identity theft complaints made to the FTC pales in comparison to the estimates of identity theft victimization in the USA. Javelin  2017  estimated that identity fraud affected 15.4 million US citizens and cost them $16 billion. The Bureau of Justice Statistics  BJS  estimated that 17.6 million US residents, or approximately 7 percent of the US  population  over  the  age  of  16,  were  the  victims  of  identity  theft  in  2014   Harrell, 2014 . The BJS found that the most common form of identity theft victimization was the unauthorized  misuse  or  attempted  misuse  of  an  existing  account,  experienced  by  16.4 million  individuals.  More  specifically,  8.6  million  individuals  experienced  credit  card fraud, 8.1 million were victimized by bank account fraud, and 1.5 million were victims of other types of account fraud, such as telephone or insurance accounts.  It  should  be  noted  that  some  individuals  may  have  experienced  multiple  forms  of victimization.  In  many  cases,  the  victims  only  found  out  when  a  financial  institution contacted them  in 45 percent of the incidents  or when noticing fraudulent charges on their  accounts   18  percent  of  incidents .  Although  two-thirds  of  identity  theft  victims reported direct financial losses, only 14 percent experienced out-of-pocket losses. Within this  group,  half  experienced  losses  of  less  than  $100,  but  14  percent  suffered  losses  of more than a $1,000. Only 10 percent of identity theft victims reported the incident to law enforcement.  Rather,  the  majority   87%   reported  the  victimization  to  a  credit  card company or bank.  Similarly, estimates from the UK vary depending on whether the figures are based on reporting  or  survey  estimates.  Cifas   2017   reported  that  almost  173,000  identity  fraud cases were reported in the UK in 2016. Although this was only a 2 percent increase from 2015,  it  was  a  52  percent  increase  from  2014.  Identity  fraud  may  now  represent  more than half of all fraud cases in the UK  Cifas, 2017 . The National Fraud Authority  2013  had  previously  found  that  8.8  percent  of  a  nationally  representative  sample  of  citizens had been victims of identity fraud in 2012. They lost an average of £1,203 each, which is the equivalent of £3.3 billion at the national level  National Fraud Authority, 2013 . In a  221   more recent survey, Experian  2016  estimated that there were 3.25 million UK victims with costs closer to £5.4 billion.  Evidence from Experian India  2016 , the only provider of fraud detection services in the  country,  suggests  that  there  has  been  a  substantive  increase  in  fraudulent applications for financial products in 2015. In fact, identity theft incidents accounted for 77 percent of all cases reported, mostly involving applications for loans and credit cards through the use of fraudulently obtained credentials  Experian India, 2016 . There was also an increase during the year of frauds based on stolen personal information, with 18 percent of all detected frauds involving this sort of information. In addition, there was a 50 percent increase in attempts to obtain mortgages using stolen credentials over 2015.  Given the scope of identity theft and fraud, it is important to note that criminals can obtain  PII  in  two  ways:  low-tech  and  high-tech  methods.  Low-tech  identity  theft  can involve  simple  techniques  such  as  taking  personal  information  out  of  mailboxes  and trash cans or during the commission of a robbery or burglary  Allison et al., 2005; Copes and Vieraitis, 2009 . Offenders may also use high-tech methods via computers and or the Internet  to  obtain  personal  information  that  is  seemingly  unprotected  by  the  victim  Chu,  Holt,  and  Ahn,  2010;  Holt  and  Lampke,  2010;  Newman  and  Clarke,  2003;  Wall, 2007 .  It is not clear how many identity crimes stem from low- or high-tech means due to the fact  that  victims  may  not  be  able  to  identify  when  or  how  their  identity  was  stolen  Harrell,  2014 .  In  addition,  law  enforcement  and  trade  agencies  are  only  beginning  to measure the scope of identity crimes and to capture this information effectively  Federal Trade Commission, 2016; Harrell, 2014; National Crime Agency, 2017 . It is possible that there may be an increase in the number of identity theft and fraud incidents stemming from high-tech means due to the ease with which individual offenders can compromise the PII of thousands of victims at once. For instance, businesses and financial institutions store sensitive customer information in massive electronic databases that can be accessed and  compromised  by  hackers   Chu  et al.,  2010;  Holt  and  Lampke,  2010;  Newman  and Clarke, 2003; Wall, 2007 .  The extent of hacks affecting consumer PII was demonstrated when the US company Heartland  Payment  Systems  announced  that  their  system  security  had  been compromised during 2008 by a small group of hackers. The company processed over 11 million credit and debit card transactions for over 250,000 businesses across the USA on a  daily  basis   Verini,  2010 .  Thus,  hackers  targeted  their  systems  and  were  able  to infiltrate  and  install  malware  that  would  capture  sensitive  data  in  transit  without triggering system security  Krebs, 2011 . In turn, they were able to acquire information from 130 million credit and debit cards processed by 100,000 businesses  Verini, 2010 .  These  sorts  of  mass  breaches  are  increasingly  common.  The  compromise  of  the  US retail giants Target and Neiman Marcus in late 2013 exposed more than 40 million credit and  debit  card  accounts  with  prospective  losses  for  consumers  estimated  to  be  in  the millions   Higgins,  2014 .  In  addition,  the  Hard  Rock  Hotel  and  Casino  in  Las  Vegas recently experienced a data breach in which client information, including names, credit  222   and debit card numbers, and the CVV of the cards, were stolen  PandaLabs, 2015 . Two online dating services, AdultFriendFinder and Ashley Madison, also recently experienced major data breaches in which the personal information of their clients was released. In the  case  of  Ashley  Madison,  37  million  customers  had  their  information  released, including  completed  transactions,  email  addresses,  and  sexual  preferences   PandaLabs, 2015 .  In light of the scope of data breaches, Symantec  2016  reported that over half a billion personal records were stolen or lost in 2015. In nearly half of the cases, the records were accidentally made public by the entity rather than being released from an attacker. There were a total of 318 breaches with nine of them being considered mega-breaches in which over 10 million identities were exposed. For their estimates, the average data breach lost 1.3 million records, though the median incident led to the loss of only 4,885 records.  While  financial  data  is  a  tremendously  attractive  target  for  thieves  and  fraud-sters, there  is  also  evidence  that  healthcare  data  breaches  are  increasing.  The  amount  of sensitive  PII  that  could  be  acquired  through  an  error  or  weakness  in  healthcare  data storage is tremendous  Heath, 2015 . The information stored by healthcare providers in the USA frequently includes social security information and other pieces of identifying information  that  can  be  used  for  traditional  identity  fraud,  but  could  also  provide information to assist in medical and insurance fraud in the USA. In fact, the company Experian in the USA reported working on remediating damages and repairing systems involved  in  compromises  of  180  healthcare  breaches  in  the  first  nine  months  of  2015 alone   Heath,  2015 .  Symantec   2016   reported  that  one-third  of  data  breaches  in  2015 included medical records, although they note that this high percentage could also be an indicator of the higher standards in the health sector to report data breaches.  One  of  the  more  recent  well-known  massive  data  breaches  that  shook  the  health sector targeted Anthem, which is the second-largest provider of healthcare in the USA  Symantec,  2016 .  In  2015,  Anthem’s  data  breach  exposed  78  million  patient  records, which  may  cost  the  company  over  $100  million   PandaLabs,  2015 .  This  attack  was traced  by  Symantec  back  to  Black  Vine,  a  well-funded  group  with  associations  to  a Chinese-based IT security organization.  223   Email-based scams  In the context of online fraud, some of the most common schemes are perpetrated based on  initial  contact  via  email.  The  interactive  nature  of  email  content  coupled  with  the ability  to  access  hundreds  of  thousands,  if  not  millions,  of  users  makes  this  an  ideal medium for fraudsters. There are several fraud schemes sent to prospective victims every day. In the following sections, we discuss some of the most prevalent forms. This is not meant  to  be  an  exhaustive  list.  Instead,  our  purpose  is  to  expose  you  to  the  most common types of schemes you may encounter on a consistent basis.  Nigerian email schemes  In the realm of online fraud schemes, one of the most common and costly types is the advance  fee  email  scheme.  These  are  so  named  because  the  sender  requests  a  small amount of money up front from the recipient in order to share a larger sum of money later   see  Box  6.2  for  an  example .  These  messages  are  more  commonly  referred  to  as “Nigerian” scams because the emails often come from individuals who claim to reside in a foreign country, particularly Nigeria or other African nations  see Smith, Holmes, and Kaufmann,  1999 .  Some  also  call  them  419 scams  as  a  reference  to  the  Nigerian  legal statutes used to prosecute fraud  Edelson, 2003; Holt and Graves, 2007 .  Box 6.2 Nigerian email text  Subject: MR SULEMAN BELLO  FROM THE OFFICE MR SULEMAN BELLO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  ADB . OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO. WEST AFRICA.

THANKS YOURS TRULY SULEMAN BELLO  Source: Email received by one of the authors.  There  are  several  variations  of  this  scam  used  on  a  regular  basis  to  defraud  225   individuals. One of the most common messages involves the sender making a claim that they are a wealthy heir to a deceased person who needs help moving inherited funds out of the country. In turn, they will give the recipient a proportion of the sum in exchange for  financial  and  legal  assistance   Edel-son,  2003;  Holt  and  Graves,  2007 .  Another popular variation of the message involves the sender posing as a public official who has been able to skim funds from a business or government contract  Edelson, 2003 . They are seeking a contact to help get the money they illegally obtained out of the account. A similar scheme takes the form of a banker or attorney trying to close a dead customer’s account using the potential victim as the deceased’s next of kin  Edelson, 2003 . Other adaptations have been identified, including the sender being in legal trouble or involved in some form of illegal behavior. Thus, the sender attempts to ensnare the recipient in an illicit, yet ultimately false, transaction.  Potential  victims  who  receive  and  respond  to  one  of  these  messages  are  defrauded through the use of two techniques. First, and most often, the respondent will contact the sender, and the sender will then ask for a small donation to get an account or fund out of a  holding  process.  The  sender  will  then  continue  to  receive  small  payments  from  the victim because of complications in obtaining their account or additional legal fees that are  needed  to  move  the  account   Smith  et al.,  1999 .  The  process  continues  until  the victim  is  no  longer  willing  or  is  too  embarrassed  to  pay  additional  money,  which  can cause a significant dollar loss for the victim.  An  additional  proportion  of  scammers  will  avoid  the  long-term  process  in  favor  of more  immediate  fraud.  They  achieve  this  by  requesting  that  the  recipient  provide personal  information,  such  as  their  name,  address,  employer,  and  bank  account information.  The  sender  may  make  this  request  under  the  guise  of  ensuring  that  the recipient is a sound and trustworthy associate  Edelson, 2003; King and Thomas, 2009 . The information is, however, used surreptitiously to engage in identity theft and drain the victim’s accounts.  Due  to  the  millions  of  spam  messages  sent  every  day,  it  is  unknown  how  many respondents  are  victimized  each  year.  Some  may  not  report  their  experience  to  law enforcement agencies out of fear that they will be prosecuted for their involvement in the  potentially  illegal  fund  transfers  described  in  the  initial  message  they  received  Buchanan  and  Grant,  2001 .  They  may  also  feel  too  embarrassed  that  they  lost substantial money because they responded to an email or were swindled by an otherwise implausible scam  Buchanan and Grant, 2001 .  As  a  result,  advance  fee  fraud  victims  constitute  a  substantial  dark  figure  of cybercrime.  It  is  clear,  however,  that  victims  of  advanced  fee  fraud  email  scams  lose massive  amounts  of  money  each  year.  The  Internet  Crime  Complaint  Center   2015  reported  that  they  received  288,000  complaints  in  2015,  and,  of  those,  advance  fee  and 419 scams were the second most common type of fraud reported and cost US residents $99  million.  Although  the  average  scam  may  only  cost  a  victim  around  a  $1,000, scammers  obtain  these  funds  slowly  from  multiple  victims  over  the  course  of  a  few weeks  and  accumulate  a  substantial  amount  of  money.  Thus,  it  is  to  a  scammer’s  226   advantage to send out as many messages as possible in order to increase the likelihood of a response.

These  messages  often mimic legitimate communications from financial institutions and service providers, such as  PayPal  or  eBay.  The  message  usually  contains  some  of  the  branding  and  language commonly  used  by  that  institution  in  an  attempt  to  convince  the  recipient  that  the message is legitimate  see Box 6.3 for an example . The message usually suggests that a person’s account has been compromised, needs to be updated, or has some problem that must  be  corrected  as  soon  as  possible.  The  time-sensitive  nature  of  the  problem  is commonly stressed to confuse or worry the prospective victim in order to ensure a rapid response.  Box 6.3 Phishing example  From: service@amazon.com Subject: Update your Amazon.com account information  Dear Customer,  You  have  received  this  email  because  we  have  strong  reason  to  believe  that  your Amazon  account  had  been  recently  compromised.

Source: Email received by one of the authors.  The  email  will  also  include  web  links  that  appear  to  connect  to  the  appropriate website so that the victim can immediately enter their login information for the affected account. Generally, however, the link redirects the user to a different site controlled by the scammer that utilizes collection tools to capture user data. Better fraudulent sites will also feature branding or logos from the institution to help further promote the legitimacy of  the  phishing  email.  Upon  arriving  at  the  site,  individuals  are  prompted  to  enter sensitive information, such as their bank account number, username, password, or even in some cases Personal Identification Numbers  PINs  to validate their account. Upon entering the data, it is captured by the scammer for later use and may either redirect the victim back to the original website for the company or provide a page thanking them for their information.  This type of fraud is actually quite old, dating back to the 1990s when ISPs billed users by  the  hour  for  access.  Skilled  hackers  would  try  to  capture  the  usernames  and passwords of unsuspecting victims by posing as an ISP, especially America Online  AOL  due to its scope and penetration in the market. Fraud-sters would harvest known AOL email  addresses  and  send  messages  claiming  to  need  account  updates  or  validation  of user  profiles.  The  mass-mailing  strategy  was  like  fishing,  in  that  they  were  hoping  to hook victims through deceptive bait. The term “phishing” emerged as a corruption of the term  akin  to  that  of  phreaking  within  the  general  argot  of  the  hacker  community. Unsuspecting victims who believed these messages to be legitimate would forward their information  to  the  sender  in  the  hopes  of  correcting  their  account.  The  fraudsters,  228   however, would keep the accounts for their own use or trade the information with others for pirated software or other information.  The success of phishing techniques led some to begin to target e-commerce and online banking sites as they became popular with larger segments of the population in the early 2000s.  Hackers  began  to  recognize  the  value  in  targeting  these  institutions,  and  some began  to  create  sophisticated  phishing  kits  that  came  pre-loaded  with  the  images  and branding  of  the  most  prominent  global  banks.  These  kits,  combined  with  spam  email lists, enabled hackers to readily steal financial data from thousands of unsuspecting users around the world. In fact, the Anti-Phishing Working Group  2017a  tracked over 1.22 million  unique  phishing  email  campaigns  in  2016  alone.  The  problem  of  phishing  has become so commonplace that over 277,693 unique phishing websites were identified in the fourth quarter of 2016  Anti-Phishing Working Group, 2017b . These sites are often hosted  primarily  in  the  USA,  due  in  part  to  the  substantive  proportion  of  hosting resources  available  to  hackers,  along  with  Germany,  Canada,  France,  and  the  United Kingdom   Anti-Phishing  Working  Group,  2013,  2017a .  Thus,  phishing  is  a  global problem that cannot be understated, though the prevalence of phishing victimization in the general population is largely unknown.  Work-at-home schemes  The use of the Internet as a medium for job solicitation and advertisements has enabled scammers to adapt existing schemes to virtual spaces. Specifically, some send out ads for so-called “work-at-home schemes” where they promise recipients substantial earnings for just a few hours of work per day  see Box 6.4 for an example: Turner, Copes, Kerley, and  Warner,  2013 .  These  jobs  can  all  be  performed  in  the  home,  whether  online  or through simple physical tasks, such as reviewing store performances, stuffing envelopes, selling  various  products,  data  processing,  or  repackaging  and  shipping  goods  for companies.  Typically  the  recipient  also  requires  no  training  or  advanced  degrees  to complete the job. Regardless of the form of work, the scammers typically make money by requiring prospective employees to pay fees for training materials, access to databases for  work,  or  products  and  packaging  materials.  However,  the  scammer  may  not  send these  materials  or  may  provide  information  that  is  of  no  actual  value  to  the  victim. Alternatively, victims may be roped into cashing fraudulent checks or buying goods and services on another person’s behalf  Turner et al., 2013 .

Mr. Richard Brown Marketing Manager for Delixi Consults & Co.  Source: Email received by one of the authors.  An extremely common form of a work-at-home scheme is called a “secret shopper” scheme.  Although  there  are  legitimate  companies  that  hire  individuals  to  engage  in shopping activities or review products, many disreputable or criminal groups use online ads to draw in unaware victims. In these schemes, the sender or fake company indicates that they are seeking people to shop at specific retailers to review the store’s procedures and  customer  service   Turner  et  al.,  2013 .  The  recipient  is  “hired,”  given  a  check  or money order by mail to use at the retailer to purchase certain goods, and is allowed to keep a proportion of the check for compensation. The “employee” of the secret shopper company buys the specified items, writes up their experience, and then ships the items to a  specified  location   Turner  et  al.,  2013 .  This  practice  actually  serves  as  a  money- laundering technique by cashing fraudulent checks or money acquired through various forms  of  fraud  and  providing  scammers  with  goods.  In  addition,  the  prospective employees can be arrested or charged with criminal activity because of their unwitting role in the scheme  Internet Crime Complaint Center, 2017 .  231   Romance scams  An additional e-mail-based scam combines various elements of Nigerian, phish-ing, and work-at-home schemes: romance scams. Unlike other email scams, victims of romance schemes  are  not  interested  in  economic  gain  but  rather  in  forming  an  emotional  and romantic  bond  with  another  person   Buchanan  and  Whitty,  2013;  Cross,  2015 .  The popularity of online dating sites and social media creates a target-rich environment for scammers to contact a broad audience who are either actively seeking or interested in a romantic  partner.  As  such,  scammers  can  manipulate  these  environments  in  order  to create  a  virtual  identity  that  will  appear  enticing  to  their  potential  victims   Buchanan and Whitty, 2013; Cross, 2015 .  The typical scheme begins via an unsolicited contact sent via a dating profile or social media account where the scammer attempts to garner a response from their target. The scammer  creates  fake  profiles  in  various  social  media  and  dating  sites  using  attractive pictures of men or women in order to increase the likelihood of a victim responding. In addition, many scammers indicate that they are US or European citizens working abroad with  no  relatives  or  family  to  help  them  cope  with  the  distance.  Their  “loneliness” creates  a  potential  bonding  point  with  their  target,  and  if  a  person  responds  to  their messages  they  will  carry  on  protracted  discussions  with  the  recipient   Buchanan  and Whitty, 2013; Cross, 2015 .  Careful  scammers  will  ask  a  great  deal  of  questions  of  their  potential  victims  in  an attempt to “get to know them,” while surreptitiously using the information to help adjust the  scam  to  increase  the  likelihood  of  responses  over  time.  The  scammer  will  also indicate their romantic interest and profound love for the victim relatively soon, which may  take  the  victim  by  surprise   Buchanan  and  Whitty,  2013;  Cross,  2015 .  They  may also  obtain  the  victim’s  address  information  and  begin  to  send  them  gifts  online  and offline in an attempt to help cement their relationship and bond the scammer and victim. Once a relationship has been established, there are a range of ways the scammer may defraud  the  victim.  All  of  these  techniques  are  similar  to  the  practices  used  in  other email scams to acquire funds. In most cases, scammers will try to make arrangements with the victim to pay them a visit in person so that they can consummate their love and enjoy  each  other’s  company   Whitty  and  Buchanan,  2012 .  Some  issue  prevents  them from  traveling  and  they  have  insufficient  funds  to  get  them  out  of  their  specific predicament. For instance, they may be unable to pay a hotel bill and will not be given back their passport until the debt is resolved. They may also claim to have been mugged or  beaten,  and  that  they  need  funds  to  pay  their  hospital  bill   Whitty  and  Buchanan, 2012 .  Victims who send funds are continually strung along for more money until such time as they realize they are being defrauded. Scammers may also ask the victim to help them  232   by  cashing  checks  on  their  behalf  as  they  are  unable  to  accept  the  payment  for  some reason. Others may ask the victim to accept goods on their behalf and reship them to another location, as the company will not ship to their location  Cross, 2015 .  Regardless  of  the  methods  used  by  the  scammer,  romance  schemes  are  extremely harmful  to  victims.  The  prevalence  and  cost  of  victimization  are  unknown,  as  many victims  may  feel  too  embarrassed  or  ashamed  to  report  their  experiences  to  law enforcement  Cross, 2015 . In the USA, 12,509 victims of romance scams reported losing approximately  $200  million  in  2015.  These  losses  averaged  to  over  $16,000  per  victim, making it the second-largest category of fraud as measured by victim loss  IC3, 2015 .  A nationally representative survey of Great Britain in 2010 found that almost 230,000 people  had  been  scammed  out  of  funds  by  romance  schemes   Whitty  and  Buchanan, 2012 .  As  a  consequence,  the  UK  National  Fraud  Intelligence  Bureau  found  that  these scams cost the UK £24 million in 2013 and £34 million in 2014 respectively  Action Fraud, 2015 .  Similarly,  the  Australian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  found  that romance  frauds  cost  citizens  over  $23.8  million  across  3,811  reported  incidents  in  2016 alone   Scamwatch,  2017 .  These  estimates  do  not,  however,  take  into  account  the emotional  hardships  victims  of  romance  schemes  experience   see  Box  6.5  for  the experience of victims in their own words . Even if an individual does not experience any economic losses, they may feel substantive psychological hurt and a sense of rejection upon realizing that the scammer was not in love with them at all  Buchanan and Whitty, 2013; Cross, 2015 .  Victims of romance schemes may not fit into a particular demographic profile. There is a hypothesis that victims are more likely to be older heterosexual women  Whitty and Buchanan, 2012 , though recent research found that both gay men and women were as likely to be victims as heterosexuals  Buchanan and Whitty, 2013 . In addition, victims appear  to  have  an  idealistic  worldview  of  romantic  partners,  placing  them  in  high emotional  and  psychological  regard  while  simultaneously  ignoring  their  potential negative  attributes   Buchanan  and  Whitty,  2013 .  These  results  are  based  on  relatively limited  research,  demonstrating  a  need  for  continuing  empirical  analysis  to  better understand the risks associated with romance scam victimization.  Box 6.5 Understanding the human dimensions of  romance scams  Dr.  Cassandra  Cross,  Senior  Lecturer,  School  of  Justice,  Faculty  of  Law, Queensland University of Technology  Techniques used by offenders to target victims  “Frank”  had  recently  lost  his  wife  to  a  brain  hemorrhage.  He  had  started  using  233   various  social  networking  websites  to  chat  to  women  across  the  globe  and,  in particular,  started  communicating  with  a  woman  in  Ghana.  During  their conversations, Frank had shared details about himself and, more importantly, details about his wife’s death. After a few months, Frank received a request for money from the brother of the woman he had been communicating with, after being advised she had been in a car crash and was suffering from the same illness that had taken his wife.  Then her brother calls me, sends me an email under her name and said she got hit by a car, her brain’s bleeding anyway, I just lost my wife with a brain hemorrhage, and they wanted $1000 for the doctor to operate, they won’t do anything unless you pay, so I sent them $1000 [or] $1200, then it started.   Frank, 73 years old   Frank was suspicious of the situation presented to him, but was willing to send the money on the off-chance that the situation was legitimate and that this woman was sick. He had also been in phone contact with the alleged doctor who was treating her, which added to the plausibility of the situation.  She got hit by this car [.] I phoned the doctor and everything I phoned the doctor because I want to know. My wife had died from a brain hemorrhage you know and I’d spent two one hour sessions, probably a long time with two different neurosurgeons down there I wanted to give them my brain. [I said to them] why don’t you try this and [this], and as it turned out a lot of the things I suggested had been tried and don’t work. She’d had a massive internal bleed in the brain, you could see the scan it was just black [.] the doctor said if it’s on the perimeter on the edge of the brain, yeah they can drain the pressure off and fix it up and I thought you know, and that’s how they got me with her. $1000 wasn’t much, but I didn’t really believe it but I said maybe if it is going to happen and she is going to die I said for a thousand dollars they can have it you know.   Frank, 73 years old   Frank’s situation illustrates the insidious way in which offenders will manipulate a person’s  emotions  and  circumstances  to  obtain  financial  benefits.  It  demonstrates the way in which Frank was presented with a situation that involved multiple actors  the woman, her brother, and the doctor  in order to increase the likelihood that he would  consent  to  the  request  for  money.  The  use  of  the  same  illness  that  had claimed his wife also reinforces the ways in which offenders will specifically target victims to gain compliance to financial requests  Cross, 2013: 33 .  Impact of romance fraud on victims  Romance  scam  victims  experience  devastating  effects  as  a  result  of  the  financial impact of fraud but also the loss of the relationship. For many, the relationship can be more difficult to grieve than the loss of money by itself.  The severity of online fraud victimisation was clearly evident in a small number of victims interviewed for Cross, Richards, and Smith  2016 . As detailed below, the emotional and psychological impacts of online fraud victimization were so great for  234   some that they had considered or even attempted suicide. The following excerpts are all taken specifically from romance fraud victims.  I have come close to ending my life, honestly, I still feel that way  interview 13 .  [At the time I reported the fraud] I said “As far as I’m concerned, I am ready to suicide”  interview 34 .  I even tried to kill myself I was so depressed, because [of] not just the money but because of the shame. My family was very upset  interview 43 .  I [was] sort of really despairing and about to commit suicide. [.] I was desperate, I mean I was considering suicide.  I  was  that  distraught  with  what  I’d  actually  done  [.]  [further  into  the  interview]  I  was  really despairing. I was, I saw this end for myself through suicide. And then I thought, “this is ridiculous. If I don’t say something to somebody, I’m going to do it [commit suicide]”  interview 49 .  One  woman,  whose  fraud  victimization  followed  a  number  of  other  adverse  life events,  including  a  violent  intimate  partner  relationship  and  the  loss  of  her  job, described taking steps towards ending her life:  Participant: I had literally torn up any personal things – letters, diaries, photos  – so there would be no trace left.  Interviewer: Of this [online fraud] incident? Participant: Of me. [.] You just feel so stupid. [.] [I felt] pretty useless really, that is what I kept thinking, a bit of a waste of space, that is what I kept thinking about myself.  Interviewer: Did you ever think of suicide? Participant: Yeah I did. I just shut down, but I would make sure my underwear was clean. It was just so bizarre, and there would be no trace of me left, I would just evaporate  interview 44 .   Cross et al., 2016: 28–29   Shame and embarrassment in disclosing romance fraud  For  many  victims  of  romance  fraud,  embarrassment  stemming  from  both  using online dating services, and having been defrauded, combined to prevent them from seeking  support  from  loved  ones.  Many  victims  of  romance  fraud  had  either  not disclosed to their family and friends that they were seeking romance online, or had provided only limited details. For example, one woman said:  I’ve got adolescent kids. [.] They knew about it, they knew I was on a [dating] site. [.] But they’re not real comfortable talking about it [.] [later in the interview]. My kids were certainly okay about the fact that I was on the [dating] site but didn’t really want any sort of details  interview 5 .  A  male  victim,  who  had  sought  out  a  relationship  on  an  international  dating website, described his reluctance to tell his family about being defrauded:  The stigma is twofold. One is to admit to your family that you have gone onto an international dating site,  235   which  is  socially  something  which  most  Anglo-Saxon  children  would  struggle  with.  [.]  It’s  the  whole stigma of being on a site that’s a problem with the mail order bride thing. [.] The other thing is I got stung. That is two things there that you will emotionally not share  interview 4 .   Cross et al., 2016: 61   References  Cross, C. A.  2013 .

Pump-and-dump stock schemes  Over the past two decades, the Internet has become an ideal medium for small investors to  trade  stocks.  The  information-gathering  and  analytical  capabilities  afforded  by technology allow investors to micromanage their accounts without the need to engage brokers and firms with their own concepts of good or sound investments  Tillman and Indergaard, 2005 . Instead, consumers can use firms that allow the individual to buy and sell  stocks  based  on  their  own  hunches  and  information.  To  that  end,  scammers  have begun to leverage email as a means to advertise stocks with generally low value to the larger public  Tillman and Indergaard, 2005 . Often, this is performed through the use of spam emails called pump-and-dump messages  see Box 6.6 for an example .  The  text  of  a  pump-and-dump  message  indicates  that  a  small  company  with  a  low stock  price  is  on  the  cusp  of  becoming  a  hot  commodity  due  to  the  development  of  a product or idea with substantive growth potential. These companies may not be traded in larger markets such as the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE  because of the lack of publicly available information on the product, but are rather sold in smaller “over-the- counter” markets  Tillman and Indergaard, 2005 . This makes it difficult for investors to determine  the  validity  of  claims  or  to  actively  research  a  product.  Some  may  take  the advice that they see and, because of its generally low price, invest in the hopes of turning a profit.  Box 6.6 Pump-and-dump message  Hey Kids.  236   Statler here.

The scammers, however, are attempting to artificially “pump up” the price by enticing individuals to purchase the stock. This concurrently increases the stock price within the larger market, inspiring further investor confidence which may further increase its value. The individuals behind the scheme will then “dump,” or sell, their shares when they feel it  has  reached  a  critical  mass.  By  selling,  the  stock  price  will  begin  to  drop,  causing remaining  shareholders  to  lose  substantial  amounts  as  the  price  declines   Tillman  and Indergaard, 2005 . Thus, these schemes are worthwhile only to those insiders who can pump the stocks and dump them at the artificially inflated rate.  While  this  sort  of  scam  may  appear  to  be  specialized  and  affect  only  those  with substantial incomes, it is important to note that these spam messages may constitute as much  as  15  percent  of  all  spam  email  in  a  given  year   Bohme  and  Holz,  2006 .  This percentage fluctuates widely as penny stock emails only constituted 1 percent of spam emails in 2012 but 16 percent of all spam in 2013  MarketWatch, 2014 . These messages are  also  different  from  other  scams  in  that  they  do  not  require  the  sender  to  interact directly with the victims. Instead, the spam generators purchase the stocks in advance of their  email  campaigns  and  will  track  the  rise  of  the  stock  they  advertise   Hanke  and Hauser, 2006 . Often, the spammers will sell their stock within a few days of the initial message distribution, as the price of the stock will reach an inflated peak price. Selling at this time ensures the greatest possible rate of return on their investment. In fact, Frieder and  Zittrain   2007   suggest  that  spammers  can  generate  a  4  percent  rate  of  return  on their initial investment, while victims lose at least 5 percent within a two-day period.  The  potential  profits  earned  by  pump-and-dump  scammers  was  demonstrated  in  a 2015 spam campaign perpetrated via the globally popular WhatsApp messaging service.  237   Users received messages from individuals claiming to be Wall Street insiders stating that people  should  buy  stock  in  a  digital  currency  company  called  Avra   Lipka,  2015 .  The stock went from an 11 cent value on the morning of Friday, August 21 to $1.26 before noon the same day. The stock then closed at below $1 the same day, suggesting that the primary spammers had cashed out while the stock was at its highest value. By Monday, August 24 the stock closed at 24 cents, suggesting that the scam cycle had run its course. The  fact  that  the  stocks  affected  are  commonly  traded  through  smaller  investment markets makes them difficult to track and even harder to disrupt, as the spammers and investors  cannot  be  readily  identified.  There  have  been  several  noteworthy  arrests  of pump-and-dump  scammers,  such  as  the  recent  indictment  of  seven  individuals  in  the USA for their roles in perpetrating a massive scheme via spam and false posts on social media  sites   US  Attorney’s  Office,  2013 .  The  scope  of  this  scheme  was  massive;  it  is estimated that the perpetrators gained more than $120 million in fraudulent stock sales, affecting  victims  in  35  countries   US  Attorney’s  Office,  2013 .  The  perpetrators  were caught due to collaborative investigations by the FBI, RCMP, and agencies in the UK and China,  particularly  through  the  use  of  intercepts  of  electronic  communications  and phone  calls  between  participants   US  Attorney’s  Office,  2013 .  Thus,  pump-and-dump schemes  require  a  substantial  investigative  effort  in  order  to  detect  and  disrupt  these scams.  E-commerce sites  The increased use of the Internet by consumers to identify and purchase goods has also enabled  fraudsters  to  find  ways  to  distribute  counterfeit  goods  through  online  outlets due to the large return on investment and low risk of detection  Wall and Large, 2010 . The sale of counterfeit goods is actually a form of intellectual property theft  see Chapter 5   in  that  individuals  create,  distribute,  and  sell  products  that  closely  replicate  or blatantly  copy  the  original  designs  of  a  privately  owned  product.  The  counterfeit product,  however,  is  of  a  lower  quality  despite  using  similar  branding  and  designs  to entice  buyers,  while  none  of  the  profits  are  returned  to  the  original  copyright  holder  Wall  and  Large,  2010 .  As  a  result,  counterfeiting  can  harm  the  economic  health  and reputation  of  a  company  due  to  the  sale  of  poor-quality  products  using  stolen  designs and intellectual property.  Spam email is a particularly practical way to advertise counterfeit products because the  creator  can  use  language  which  suggests  that  their  prices  are  very  low  for  high- quality  items  that  otherwise  make  a  social  statement  or  help  the  buyer  gain  social position   Wall  and  Large,  2010 .  The  lack  of  regulation  in  online  markets  also  allows sellers to offer counterfeit products, which may look like the authentic product, directly to consumers. Online spaces do not allow consumers to properly inspect an item, forcing them to rely on the images and descriptions of products. As a result, counterfeiters can use images including legitimate brand logos and photos of the actual product to create  238   advertisements that speak to the value and low cost of their merchandise  Balsmeier et al., 2004; Wall and Large, 2010; see Box 6.7 for an example . In turn, consumers are only able to evaluate the advertisement and may not realize they have been swindled until a poor-quality forgery or fake arrives in place of the original item.

Spam email is a key resource for counterfeiters to advertise and lure in unsuspecting consumers,  as  fraudsters  can  drive  traffic  to  online  markets  that  they  manage. Alternatively, they may use existing markets, such as online retail sites, where they can artificially  manipulate  indicators  of  trust  and  reputation  to  appear  more  legitimate  Dolan, 2004 . In fact, evidence from the brand protection company MarkMonitor found that one of six individuals seeking genuine products at a deep discount was directed to rogue  websites  that  appeared  legitimate  in  order  to  make  a  purchase   Smith,  2014 .  In addition, research on Nike products advertised on Google demonstrated that 20 percent of  results  would  direct  a  consumer  to  a  website  selling  counterfeit  products  despite frequent attempts to take down this content  Wadleigh, Drew, and Moore, 2015 .  Counterfeiters  may  also  use  auction  sites  and  secondary  retail  markets  online  as  a means to sell their products. For instance, an existing eBay seller profile that has been inactive may be stolen and hijacked by a fraudster in order to sell counterfeit products while appearing to be a reputable seller in good standing  Chua, Wareham, and Robey, 2007;  Gregg  and  Scott,  2006 .  Sellers  can  also  create  accounts  using  fake  names  or addresses, making it difficult to locate the identity of the person responsible for the sale of fraudulent goods  Gregg and Scott, 2006 .  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  OECD  reported that the estimated value of imported fake goods worldwide was $461 billion in 2013, which was 2.5 percent of all global imports  OECD, 2016 . This included all physical counterfeit goods which infringe trademarks, design rights or patents, and tangible pirated products that would violate copyright protection. At the same time, this does not include online piracy  which  further  affects  retailers  and  copyright  holders   see  Chapter  5 .  Twenty percent  of  fake  goods  that  were  seized  affected  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  US companies,  though  corporations  in  Italy   15% ,  France   12% ,  Switzerland   12% ,  Japan  239    8% ,  and  Germany   8%   were  also  affected.  Almost  two-thirds   63.2%   of  fake  goods originated from China with another 21.3 percent originating in Hong Kong, totaling 84.5 percent of all fake goods seized. Although many of the purchases were completed online, most fake goods  62%  that were seized were shipped through parcel post.  Limited research suggests that consumers who buy counterfeit goods wish to conform to current fashion norms and be part of the “it-crowd.” They want to position themselves within  the  social  elite  who  own  authentic  versions  of  a  counterfeit  product   Wall  and Large, 2010 . Thus, counterfeit luxury goods allow sellers to "trade upon the perception of and desire for exclusivity and to extract its high value by deceiving consumers into buying  non-authentic  and  often  low-quality  products"   Wall  and  Large,  2010:  1099 . Evidence  suggests  that  the  most  popular  brands  sought  after  by  consumers  seeking counterfeit  products  are  high-end  luxury  labels,  including  Louis  Vuitton®,  Gucci®, Burberry®,  Tiffany®,  Prada®,  Hermes®,  Chanel®,  Dior®,  Yves  Saint  Laurent®,  and Cartier®   Ledbury  Research,  2007 .  The  majority  of  counterfeit  products  purchased through  email-based  ads  are  clothes   55% ,  shoes   32% ,  leather  goods   24% ,  jewelry  20% , and watches  26%   Ledbury Research, 2007 .  Those consumers who are defrauded through eBay often have limited recourse to deal with the problem  Dolan, 2004 . Currently, eBay does not offer monetary compensation to  victims  of  fraud;  the  company  will  only  log  the  complaint  and  mark  the  seller’s profile. PayPal and payment providers may absorb fraudulent charges, though this does not  guarantee  that  victims  will  be  fully  compensated.  As  a  result,  many  victims  of auction fraud do not know where to turn to file a complaint. Those who do complain to some agency often report dissatisfaction with the process  Dolan, 2004 . However, their experiences  do  not  prevent  them  from  engaging  in  online  commerce,  as  more  than  75 percent of victims go on to buy goods via auctions and e-commerce sites  Dolan, 2004; see Box 6.8 for details on the development of brand protection communities to minimize the risk of purchasing counterfeit goods .  Box 6.8 The rise of virtual brand protection  communities  The  rise  of  e-commerce  and  secondary  market  sales  has  created  unique opportunities  for  educated  consumers  to  find  products  at  very  low  prices.  This system has also been exploited by counterfeiters and criminals as a means to dispose of fake merchandise with minimal difficulty, as consumers are unable to examine their products prior to making a purchase. Given these risks, a number of so-called independent  virtual  brand  communities  have  emerged  online  to  help  consumers make  informed  purchases.  This  term  is  largely  born  out  of  consumer  research, referencing the fact that individual consumers band together online based on their shared interest in a specific brand or product  Muniz and O’Guinn, 2001 . The group functions  independently  of  the  brand  owner,  operating  by  loyal  customers  as  a  240   means  to  share  their  commitment  to  the  brand,  communicate  information  and knowledge about its products, as well as the values they have imbued in the brand  Muniz and O’Guinn, 2001; Sloan, Bodey, and Gyrd-Jones, 2015 .  Brand  communities  can  also  serve  as  a  resource  to  minimize  losses  due  to counterfeiting by detecting counterfeit retailers in advance of a purchase  Basu and Muylle,  2003:  163 .  Evidence  suggests  that  consumers  participate  in  brand communities to learn about products and quality, as well as user experiences  Millán and Diaz, 2014 . In turn, consumers may be properly informed of the ways in which a  product  should  be  marketed,  how  it  should  appear,  and  which  vendors  may  be considered  legitimately  associated  with  the  brand   Royo-Vela  and  Casamassima, 2011 .  In  particular,  independent  virtual  brand  communities  can  be  a  valuable mechanism to authenticate products and sellers associated with a particular brand or industry   Basu  and  Muylle,  2003 .  Participants  can  share  the  potential  red  flags associated  with  counterfeit  products,  and  the  perceived  legitimacy  of  a  vendor  or their  website   Mavlanova  and  Benbunan-Fich,  2010;  Narcum  and  Coleman,  2015 . There  are  a  number  of  these  communities  associated  with  brands,  such  as niketalk.com,  which  functions  as  a  forum  for  enthusiastic  fans  of  the  Nike  brand  and  other  athletic  shoe  brands   to  discuss  products,  rate  their  performance,  and authenticate  online  retailers  and  independent  vendors  operating  on  sites  like  e- bay.com. The site has no association with Nike, but operates as one of the world’s largest  online  communities  to  discuss  this  brand.  There  are  similar  forums  for various  retail  categories,  such  as  thebagforum.com  which  operates  as  a  forum  for individuals to discuss various purses and handbag makers and retailers, as well as authenticate products prior to making a purchase. Thus, brand communities serve a vital  role  in  assisting  consumers  in  determining  the  legitimacy  of  a  product  and reducing the potential losses associated with counterfeit purchases.

Almost a quarter of all spam is advertising pharmaceutical  products   Grow,  Elgin,  and  Weintraub,  2006;  Kaspersky,  2017;  see  Box 6.9 for an example . According to the Pew Internet American Life survey, 63 percent of Internet  users  have  received  spam  emails  advertising  sexual  health  medications,  55 percent received spam with regard to prescription drugs, and 40 percent received emails about an over-the-counter drug  Fox, 2004 .

In fact, the Pharmaceutical Security Institute  PSI, 2017b  has documented  a  51  percent  increase  in  the  number  of  arrests  involving  the  seizure  of counterfeit drugs between 2011 and 2015. The quantity of drugs seized varies, though 33 percent of all those arrests made in 2015 involved over 1,000 doses of a medication, while 56  percent  involved  less  than  that  amount.  Seizures  involving  smaller  quantities  have increased substantially over the past few years, which is due to the increased volume of counterfeit  drugs  being  sold  online   PSI,  2017b .  This  is  also  a  global  problem,  with arrests made in 128 countries; however, the majority of arrests and seizures occurred in Asian  countries  during  2015   PSI,  2017a .  North  American  seizures  and  arrests  also increased 100 percent from 2014 to 2015, which is again likely a function of purchases of counterfeit pharmaceutical products online  PSI, 2017a .  Online pharmaceuticals present a substantial threat to consumers, as they can obtain prescription  drugs  without  an  actual  prescription.  The  United  Nations’  International Narcotics  Control  Board   INCB   found  that  approximately  90  percent  of  all pharmaceutical  sales  achieved  online  are  made  without  a  prescription   Finley,  2009 . Sullivan  2004  found 495 websites selling prescription drugs in a single week of analysis, and  only  approximately  6  percent  of  these  sites  required  any  evidence  of  an  actual prescription. Similarly, the US General Accounting Office  2004  found that only 5 of the 29 pharmacies based in the USA required validation of a prescription before distributing drugs.  Many  online  pharmacies  hosted  in  foreign  countries  relied  on  medical questionnaires, or required no information at all from the consumer in order to acquire a prescription  Finley, 2009 .  As a consequence, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate online pharmacies from those designed expressly to sell counterfeit products to unsuspecting consumers. In fact, there is  a  distinct  threat  to  consumer  safety  posed  by  the  sale  of  prescription  drugs  online  Grow  et  al.,  2006;  Herper,  2005;  Phillips,  2005;  Stoppler,  2005;  Tinnin,  2005 .  Unlike luxury goods counterfeiting, the consumers who buy from online pharmacies may not be cognizant  of  the  potential  for  adulteration  or  outright  useless  ingredients  included  in these  products.  Stoppler   2005   reported  that  drugs  purchased  from  illegal  online pharmacies  have  the  potential  to:   1   be  outdated  or  expired;   2   be  manufactured  in subpar  facilities;   3   contain  dangerous  ingredients;   4   be  too  strong  or  too  weak;   5   243   contain  the  wrong  drug,  or   6   be  complete  fakes.  In  fact,  the  US  Food  and  Drug Association reported that approximately 90 percent of all prescription drugs coming into the  USA  purchased  through  email  or  postal  mail  are  dangerous  and  include  minimal active ingredients  Tinnin, 2005 .  An  additional  concern  lies  in  the  difficulty  of  regulating  or  deterring  illegal  online pharmacies.  This  is  a  consequence  of  the  anonymity  afforded  by  the  Internet  and computer  technologies.  Offenders  can  quickly  create  a  pharmacy,  sell  products,  and either  move  their  website  to  a  different  address  or  completely  disappear  before  law enforcement can begin a proper investigation. In addition, the website creators can set up  their  web  address  to  appear  to  be  hosted  in  any  country  and  utilize  branding  and imagery that would make the site appear to be legitimate. For instance, LegitScript and KnujOn conducted an investigation of “rogue” Internet pharmacies, designed to “sell or facilitate the sale of prescription drugs in violation of federal or state laws and accepted drug  safety  standards”  through  the  search  engine  bing.com   LegitScript  and  KnujOn, 2009 . The authors were able to identify ten rogue pharmacies advertising on the search engine,  though  they  were  all  removed  within  days  of  their  initial  investigation.  The authors were, however, able to obtain a prescription drug without an actual prescription through  another  rogue  pharmacy  advertising  on  bing.com   LegitScript  and  KnujOn, 2009 . Thus, the problem of counterfeit pharmaceuticals poses a potentially serious risk to  vulnerable  populations,  which  may  make  this  more  difficult  to  combat  than  other forms of online fraud.  244   The problem of carding and stolen data markets  The  range  of  fraud  schemes  discussed  above  suggests  that  anyone  can  be  a  target  for online fraud and identity theft. Many of these schemes are too good to be true, such as the  419  emails  which  indicate  that  a  person  can  make  millions  of  dollars  if  they  are willing to pay a few hundred dollars up front. Other scams are more difficult to assess, such as phishing emails that mirror the originating website and company as closely as possible and prey on victims’ fears of compromise. Each of these fraud types, however, requires the victim to engage an offender in some way.  The  need  for  victim–offender  interaction  in  order  to  facilitate  fraud  has  decreased over the past decade with the growth of large-scale repositories of consumer data, such as bank records, personal information, and other electronic files  see Allison et al., 2005; Furnell, 2002; Newman and Clarke, 2003; Wall, 2001, 2007 . As discussed earlier, hackers can  now  simply  compromise  large  databases  of  information  to  capture  victim  data without  the  need  for  any  interaction  with  others.  The  success  of  such  compromises  is evident in the fact that offenders regularly target institutions for mass exploitation. In fact,  members  of  the  group  that  breached  Heartland  Payment  Systems  were  also responsible  for  a  similar  attack  against  the  Marshalls  department  stores  and  its  parent company,  TJX,  in  2006   see  Box  6.10  for  details  on  one  of  the  hackers  responsible  for these  breaches .  That  compromise  led  to  the  loss  of  45  million  credit  card  records  and over $1 billion in customer damages  Roberts, 2007 .  more   For  www.verizonenterprise.com DBIR 2016 .  data   on   breach   rates   go   online   to:  245   Box 6.10 Albert Gonzales  In  Surprise  Appeal,  TJX  Hacker  Claims  US  Authorized  His  Crimes www.wired.com 2011 04 gonzalez-plea-withdrawal .  Albert Gonzalez, the hacker who masterminded the largest credit card heists in U.S. history, is asking a federal judge to throw out his earlier guilty pleas and lift his record-breaking 20-year prison sentence, on allegations that the government authorized his years-long crime spree.  This story details the claims made by Albert Gonzales, an individual who admitted to engaging in some of the largest data breaches in the past decade, targeting TJX, Heartland  Payment  Systems,  and  national  retail  chains.  He  claimed  that  these crimes were committed as a result of his role as an undercover informant for the US Secret Service, and that he should not be sanctioned for his involvement.  These  instances  demonstrate  the  amount  of  information  fraudsters  can  acquire  in  a short amount of time. This is not the only way in which mass data can be acquired. For instance,  phishing  campaigns  may  generate  a  few  hundred  respondents  who  provide sensitive  data  in  minutes   James,  2005 .  However,  this  begs  the  question  of  what offenders can do with hundreds, thousands, or millions of credit and debit card accounts. This  is  too  much  information  for  any  one  person  to  use,  given  the  short  window  a scammer may have before fraudulent transactions are noticed. At the same time, these data have a tangible value that can be exploited in the right hands.  In  order  to  garner  the  greatest  possible  return  from  stolen  data,  individuals  have begun  to  sell  the  information  they  obtain  via  open  markets  operating  online.  This practice is sometimes referred to as carding, which involves the use and abuse of a credit card number or the identity associated with that account. This practice dates back to the mid-1990s when hackers would utilize statistical programs to randomly generate credit card numbers  Moore, 2010 . They would then check to see if these generated numbers were  actually  active.  If  so,  they  would  use  the  cards  to  engage  in  fraud.  As  access  to credit card data increased through the use of phishing and other techniques, the use of these programs decreased in favor of purchasing information on the open market.  Several studies demonstrate that hackers advertise data they have stolen in a variety of ways through advertisements in IRC channels or web forums  Holt and Lampke, 2010; Franklin, Paxson, Perrig, and Savage, 2007; Motoyama, McCoy, Levchenko, Savage, and Voelker,  2011;  Thomas  and  Martin,  2006 .  These  markets  appear  to  be  hosted  and operated primarily out of Russia and Eastern Europe, though a small proportion exist in the  USA  and  parts  of  Western  Europe   Dunn,  2012;  Symantec  Corporation,  2012 . Individuals  commonly  sell  credit  card  and  debit  card  accounts,  PIN  numbers,  and supporting customer information from around the world in bulk lots  Holt and Lampke, 2010; Franklin et al., 2007; Motoyama et al., 2011 . Some also offer “cash out” services to obtain physical money from electronic accounts by hijacking these accounts to engage in  246   electronic fund transfers established by a hacker  Holt and Lampke, 2010; Franklin et al., 2007;  Motoyama et al.,  2011;  Thomas  and  Martin,  2006 .  Others  offer  “drops  services,” whereby  individuals  purchase  electronics  and  other  goods  electronically  using  stolen cards, have them shipped to intermediaries who pawn the items, and then wire the cash to interested parties  Holt and Lampke, 2010 . A limited number of sellers also offer spam lists and malicious software tools that can be used to engage in fraud  Holt and Lampke, 2010 .  The emergence of online carding markets enables individuals to engage efficiently in credit card fraud and identity theft with minimal effort and limited technical knowledge or  skill   Franklin  et  al.,  2007;  Holt  and  Lampke,  2010;  Motoyama  et  al.,  2011 .  These markets  allow  skilled  hackers  to  garner  a  profit  through  the  sale  of  information  they acquire  to  other  criminals,  while  those  who  use  the  accounts  can  make  money  for  a small  initial  investment   Honeynet  Research  Alliance,  2003;  Franklin  et al.,  2007;  Holt and  Lampke,  2010;  Thomas  and  Martin,  2006 .  Furthermore,  individuals  around  the world may be victimized multiple times, removing the ability to control where and how individuals have access to sensitive personal information  see Box 6.11  for  details  on  a recent international incident involving stolen credit card data .  Box 6.11 Using Japanese ATMs to defraud South African  banks  Criminals Steal 1.44 billion Yen  $13 million  from 1,400 ATMs in 2½ hours  https:  www.hackread.com japan-atms-money-stolen .  [L]aw  enforcement  authorities  are  investigating  an  incident  in  which  a  group  of  more  than  100  cyber criminals  has  allegedly  stolen  1.44  billion  yen  $13  million  USD  from  1,400  convenience  stores  from automated teller machines  ATMs  all over the country [Japan] in just 2½ hours on May 15.  This  story  details  an  incident  where  a  group  of  criminals  in  multiple  cities  across Japan  used  credit  card  data  acquired  from  a  South  African  bank  to  withdraw  the maximum amount allowable from 1,400 ATMs in a matter of hours in 2016. This is arguably  the  most  rapid  and  large  amount  of  fraud  ever  conducted  offline  using card data acquired via electronic means.  247   Carding markets constitute a unique subculture driven by individual interests in the sale  and  trade  of  sensitive  information.  The  social  nature  of  sales  requires  that individuals actively engage one another in order to conduct business. The virtual nature of these markets, however, makes it difficult for actors to truly trust others because they are  unable  to  physically  inspect  goods  and  merchandise  prior  to  making  a  purchase  Franklin et al., 2007; Holt and Lampke, 2010; Motoyama et al.,  2011 .  In  the  following section, we discuss the structure of the market in detail and the social forces that shape relationships between buyers and sellers. Although there are variations in the markets currently  operating  online,  we  discuss  the  most  common  structures  observed  across multiple studies.  Carding market processes, actors, and relationships  The process of buying and selling goods in carding markets begins with an individual posting an advertisement in a forum or IRC channel describing the goods and services they have available or which they need to complete a project  Franklin et al., 2007; Holt and Lampke, 2010; Motoyama et al., 2011 . The level of information provided may vary, though  the  more  detailed  a  post  is,  the  more  likely  an  individual  may  be  to  receive  a response from interested parties. For instance, the following is an ad from a forum where an  individual  was  selling  credit  card  numbers  along  with  the  CVV2,  or  Credit Verification  Value  number.  This  three-digit  number  appears  on  the  back  of  credit  and debit cards in the signature line as a means to ensure that the customer has the card on their person at the point of sale, particularly for electronic purchases. The seller has gone to great lengths to describe his products and their utility in fraud:  Hi everyone,  I’m just a newcomer here and I offer you a great service with cheapest prices. I sell mainly CC Cvv2 US and UK. I also sell International Cvv2 if you want. Before I get Verified here, I sold Cvv2 in many forums. Some members in this forum know me. Hope I can serve you all long time.  Service details:  My CC Cvv2 comes with these infos:  Name:  Address:  City:  State:  Zip:   248   Phone:  Email:  CC number:  Exp day:  CVN:  come with Cvv2, not with CC   Basic prices for each CC Cvv2:  ++CC  without Cvv2 number :  US: 0.5$ each  UK: 1$ each  ++Cvv2: US: 1$ each Uk: 2.5$ each *** Cvv2 UK with DOB: 10$ each *** *** Cvv2 US with DOB: 3$ each *** *** US Visa Business Purchasing: 4$ each *** *** US Amex Discover: 3$ each ***  Add-on prices:  +Special Card Type: +$1 +Special Gender: +$1 +Special City or State: +$1 +Special Card BIN: +$1.5 +Special Zip Code: +$1  Term of service:  – Payment must be done before CC Cvv2 are sent. – Order over 100 CC Cvv2 get 10% discount. – Order over 500 CC Cvv2 get 15% discount. – Order over 1000 CC Cvv2 get 20% discount. *** I do replace new cards if any invalid. ***  Contact details:  +PM me in the forum. +Email me as [removed] +Yahoo ID: [removed] +ICQ: [removed] ^^ Have a good carding day and good luck ^^  249   As noted above, the seller will specify their terms of service and the degree of service they  offer  to  customers  who  need  assistance.  This  varies  based  on  the  individual  and their overall reputation within the market. In addition, sellers or buyers will include their preferred  payment  mechanism,  which  is  usually  an  electronic  medium,  such  as  Web Money  WM  or Yandex  Franklin et al., 2007; Holt and Lampke, 2010; Motoyama et al., 2011 . A proportion also indicate that they will accept  payments  via  Western  Union,  a wire transfer service that sends currency between individuals. Electronic payments are generally preferred because they can be anonymized to reduce the risk of detection or tracking by law enforcement  Franklin et al., 2007; Holt and Lampke, 2010; Motoyama et al., 2011 . Wire transfers, like Western Union, require individuals to show identification in order to receive funds, which can increase the likelihood of arrest.  Sellers also provide their preferred method of contact, since the sales and negotiation process  occurs  outside  of  the  forum  or  IRC  channel.  Most  individuals  use  the  instant messaging protocol ICQ, which is currently owned and operated out of Russia  Franklin et al., 2007; Holt and Lampke, 2010; Motoyama et al., 2011 . A proportion of sellers also provide email addresses, or will accept private messages through forum communications venues. This helps protect the details of a conversation from the general public, though it also makes it difficult for individuals to lodge a complaint if they feel they have been cheated or swindled.  In order to provide participants with some degree of information about the sellers in carding markets, some sites use a naming system in order to identify a person’s status and reputation. An individual is given a title by the moderators or operators of a forum or  IRC  channel  based  on  feedback  from  participants  and  the  use  of  testers  who  can validate  a  seller’s  claims.  Many  markets  use  the  term  unverified  seller  to  identify someone who is new and therefore unable to be fully trusted. Individuals who choose to do  business  with  that  person  do  so  at  their  own  risk   Franklin  et al.,  2007;  Holt  and Lampke, 2010; Motoyama et al., 2011 .  An individual may become a verified seller by providing a sample of data to a forum moderator  or  administrator,  or  alternatively  offering  malware  or  other  services  to  be reviewed.  Those  forums  which  offer  validation  services  will  typically  write  and  post reviews of the seller as a means of vetting an individual. Reviewers describe the quality of  a  service  or  data  source,  problems  they  may  have  had  in  using  the  data,  and  any support offered by the seller. Those sellers and service providers who met the standards of the forum may then be given verified status  Franklin et al., 2007; Holt and Lampke, 2010; Motoyama et al., 2011 .  Some markets do not use naming conventions to identify sellers, so the participants will  often  provide  feedback  within  the  forum  or  channel  to  provide  a  measure  of reputation  and  reliability.  Positive  feedback  helps  demonstrate  the  quality  of  a  seller’s data  or  services  and  may  increase  the  overall  reputation  of  a  seller  within  the  site. Negative  feedback,  however,  can  harm  a  seller’s  business  and  push  customers  toward other vendors with generally favorable reviews. A seller who does not provide data after being  paid,  is  slow  to  respond  to  customers,  or  sells  bad  data  and  does  not  offer  to  250   replace their products may be called a ripper, or rip-off artist  Franklin et al., 2007; Holt and Lampke, 2010; Motoyama et al., 2011 . This is a pejorative term in carding markets that, if left unanswered, may lead to an individual being banned from the site entirely.  The  use  of  customer  feedback  and  specialized  terms  to  identify  participants  are  the only real mechanisms available to participants in the event that they are dissatisfied with a  transaction.  Since  the  sale  and  distribution  of  stolen  financial  and  personal  data  is illegal,  participants  cannot  contact  police  or  other  customer  protection  services  if  they are  cheated.  In  addition,  the  virtual  nature  of  the  market  makes  it  difficult  for participants to confront someone in person. The use of informal sanctions is the only real way that markets can be regulated to ensure successful outcomes and general customer satisfaction  Franklin et al., 2007; Holt and Lampke, 2010; Motoyama et al., 2011 .  Social forces within carding markets  The  interactive  nature  of  carding  markets  creates  a  unique  series  of  social  forces  that shape the relationships between participants. In fact, research by Holt and Lampke  2010  indicates  that  there  are  four  key  forces  that  affect  the  interactions  and  behaviors  of buyers and sellers. These include  1  communications,  2  price,  3  product quality, and  4  customer service. The first issue, communications, is vital to ensure the efficient and rapid creation and completion of deals. Since data breaches and information theft may be detected by consumers and financial institutions, carders have a limited timeframe for data  to  remain  valid  and  active.  Those  sellers  who  immediately  respond  to  customer requests are more likely to receive praise and positive feedback. Individuals taking hours or days to respond to customer requests, or delaying the delivery of a purchased product, would receive negative feedback. This suggests that customer contact has a substantial influence on the behavior of sellers in order to garner trust and establish a reputation.  Price points also affect the way in which customers select the services of sellers. There is  some  demonstrable  competition  among  sellers  to  provide  the  lowest  cost  for  their services. Customer feedback often notes that low prices spur the decision to buy from a specific actor within the market. To help maintain customer bases over time, some sellers offer bulk discounts to regular clients or free gifts with large purchases. This is helpful to increase the amount of data a seller is able to offload and therefore maximize their profit. At the same time, customers view this as a beneficial mechanism to build trust and as a show of service  Holt and Lampke, 2010 .  At the same time, the quality of a seller’s products is vital to ensure customers return and  buy  from  them  over  the  long  term.  Those  who  offer  bad  data  at  low  prices  will receive generally unfavorable reviews because customers want to get the greatest return on their investments  Holt and Lampke, 2010 . Thus, they will seek out sellers who have reasonable prices with a greater likelihood of active accounts with some value in order to exploit those funds.  The final aspect of the market is customer service, which is an important tool to help  251   drive a seller’s reputation and placate buyers who feel they have been cheated  Holt and Lampke,  2010 .  For  instance,  some  sellers  offer  free  replacements  for  inactive  or  dead accounts to ensure that their buyers are satisfied with a purchase. A number of reputable sellers  also  operate  24–7  customer  support  lines  via  ICQ  to  ensure  that  any  technical questions  or  assistance  can  be  immediately  handled.  Such  resources  are  an  important mechanism to demonstrate a seller’s reputation and willingness to aid clients. This helps minimize the likelihood of customers being ripped off and promotes smooth transactions that satisfy market demands.  Taken  as  a  whole,  carding  markets  are  a  unique  criminal  subculture  that  mirrors elements of legitimate businesses. Their existence also engenders phish-ing, hacking, and other means of data theft in order to continually turn a profit through sales in the open market. As a result, there is a need for ongoing research to document the scope of this form of crime and identify enforcement mechanisms to disrupt their operation.  252   Identity theft and fraud laws  In light of the myriad forms of fraud that can be perpetrated online, it is critical that the criminal justice system has various mechanisms that may be employed to pursue these offenders. There are several legislative mechanisms that have emerged, primarily at the federal level, to punish fraud. The most pertinent laws in the USA are listed under the Identity  Theft  and  Assumption  Deterrence  Act  of  1998,  which  makes  it  a  federal crime  to  possess,  transfer,  or  use  a  means  of  identification  of  another  person  without authorization with the intent to commit or aid in the commission of illegal activity at the local,  state,  or  federal  level   Brenner,  2011 .  This  includes  a  variety  of  specific  acts outlined in Title 18 of the US Legal Code  section 1028 , including the following:  a.  Knowingly,  and  without  authority,  produce  an  identification  document  or supporting materials for identification documents, such as holograms or other images.  b.  Knowingly  transfer  an  identification  document  or  materials  with  the  knowledge that the item was stolen or produced without authority.  c.  Knowingly possess with the intent to use or transfer five or more identification  d.  Knowingly possess an identification document or materials with the intent to  documents or materials.  use the item to defraud.  e.  Knowingly  produce,  transfer,  or  possess  a  document-making  implement  or authentication  feature  that  will  be  used  in  the  creation  of  a  false  identity document.  f.  Knowingly possess an identification document or supporting materials of the  United States that is stolen or produced without lawful authority.  g.  Knowingly transfer, possess, or use a means of identification of another person  without authorization with intent to engage in unlawful activity.  h.  Knowingly  traffic  in  false  authentication  materials  for  use  in  the  creation  of  false identification.  These activities could affect interstate or foreign commerce, as well as any materials that are sent through the mail, such as personal identifications or passports. The punishments for identity crimes range from 5 to 15 years in prison, as well as fines and prospective forfeiture of goods and materials obtained while using an identity  Brenner, 2011 .  Under this law, an identification document is defined as “a document made or issued by  or  under  the  authority  of  the  United  States  government  [.]  with  information concerning a particular individual, is of a type of intended, or commonly accepted for the  purpose  of  identification  of  individuals”   USC  1028d .  This  law  also  specifically outlaws  the  use  of  means  of  identification,  which  includes  names,  social  security  253   or   bank   addresses,   routing  numbers,   numbers, date of birth, drivers’ license or identification numbers, passport information, employer identification numbers, biometric data  such as fingerprints , unique electronic identification  numbers,  the telecommunications identifying information of an access device, such as the IP address of  a  computer  system   Brenner,  2011 .  Finally,  this  legislation  made  the  Federal  Trade Commission  FTC  a clearinghouse for consumer information on identity-related crimes. The Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act of 2003 added two years to any prison sentence  for  individuals  convicted  of  a  felony  who  knowingly  possessed,  used,  or transferred  identity  documents  of  another  person   Brenner,  2011 .  This  act  also  added five  years  to  the  sentence  received  for  identity  theft  convictions  related  to  an  act  of violence or drug trafficking, and ten years if connected to international acts of terrorism. This  specific  enhancement  is  designed  to  further  punish  actors  who  may  develop  or create fictitious identities in support of acts of terror.  even   In  addition,  the  Identity  Theft  Enforcement  and  Restitution  Act  of  2008  is important  because  of  its  impact  on  sentencing  and  the  pursuit  of  identity  crimes  Brenner, 2011 . Specifically, this Act allows offenders to be ordered to pay restitution as a  penalty  to  victims  of  identity  theft.  This  statute  also  enables  more  effective mechanisms to prosecute offenses unrelated to computer fraud that could otherwise be prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. In addition, it expands the ability for  agencies  to  pursue  computer  fraud  actors  engaging  in  interstate  or  international offenses. Finally, this Act imposes criminal and civil forfeitures of property used in the commission of computer fraud behaviors.  A  final  piece  of  federal  legislation  to  note  is  the  Fair  and  Accurate  Credit Transactions Act of 2003. This law provided multiple protections to help reduce the risk of identity theft and assist victims in repairing their credit in the event of identity theft  Brenner,  2011 .  This  includes  requiring  businesses  to  remove  customer  credit  card information   except  for  the  last  four  digits   from  receipts  to  reduce  the  risk  of victimization. The law also allowed consumers to obtain a free credit report every year from  the  major  credit  monitoring  services  to  assist  in  the  identification  of  fraudulent transactions  or  potential  identity  theft.  Finally,  the  Act  provided  mechanisms  for consumers to place and receive alerts on their credit file to reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions. These steps are integral to protecting consumers from harm.  Many states have outlawed acts of computer-based fraud and theft. Some choose to prosecute these offenses under existing computer-hacking statutes, while others include separate  language  pertaining  to  computer  fraud   e.g.,  Arkansas,  Hawaii .  A  number  of states  have  also  outlawed  computer  theft,  which  may  include  forms  of  piracy  or computer hardware theft  e.g., Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,  Rhode  Island,  Vermont,  Virginia .  Every  state  has  laws  establishing identity theft or impersonation, though the extent to which the kind of data or identity information  is  identified  within  the  law  varies   National  Conference  of  State Legislatures, 2016 . In addition, 29 states have established specific laws and regulations for  victims  of  identity  theft  to  receive  restitution  for  their  experiences   National  254   Conference of State Legislatures, 2016 .  In  addition  to  laws  pertaining  to  fraud  and  theft,  a  small  number  of  states  have developed  legislation  related  to  large-scale  data breaches,  like  the  Heartland  Bank  or TJX compromises  National Conference of State Legislatures, 2016 . Breaches can affect hundreds of thousands of victims through no fault of their own, creating a substantive need  to  ensure  that  consumers  are  protected.  California  was  the  first  state  to  develop such a law in 2003, entitled the California Security Breach Notification Act  Cal. Civil Code . This legislation requires Californian residents to be notified of a breach whenever a database compromise leads to the loss of an individual’s first and last name along with any of the following information:  1  social security number,  2  drivers’ license number or  California  State  ID  card  number,  or   3   an  account,  debit,  or  credit  card  number  in combination with any security information that could be used to authorize a transaction, such as the three-digit security code on the card.  This  law  was  designed  to  serve  as  a  safeguard  for  consumers  in  the  event  that  a breach led to the loss of sensitive information. In addition, this legislation validated the idea that companies and organizations are obliged to protect consumer data from harm. The  near  unanimous  passing  of  this  legislation  led  other  states  to  develop  their  own language  pertaining  to  breach  notifications.  Currently,  there  are  breach  notification requirements mandated by law in 47 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands  National Conference of State Legislatures, 2016 . They differ in the extent to which a breach is defined, what entities must comply with the law, and the extent  to  which  data  must  be  protected.  This  will  no  doubt  continue  to  evolve  as  the threats to large databases of information change and increase with time.  Many  nations  around  the  world  have  also  criminalized  identity  crimes  in  some fashion, though their statutes may not actually include this phrase. For instance, India uses  the  phrase  “identity  theft”  in  their  criminal  code  under  Section  66C,  making  the fraudulent or dishonest use of passwords or unique identity information punishable by up to three years in prison and fines  Brenner, 2011 . Australia does not use this phrasing in its Criminal Code Amendment Act 2000 in section 135.1, but this new code recognizes general  dishonesty  where  a  person  is  guilty  if  they  do  anything  with  the  intention  of dishonesty, causing a loss to another person, and that person is a Commonwealth entity  Brenner, 2011 .  Canada’s federal Criminal Code also has multiple sections related to identity crimes. Under  section  402.2,  anyone  who  knowingly  obtains  or  possesses  another  person’s identity information, such that the data may be used to commit some form of fraud or deceit, may be subject to up to five years in prison  Holt and Schell, 2013 . In addition, section 403 criminalizes the fraudulent use of another person’s identity information to  1  gain advantage for themselves or others,  2  obtain or gain interest in property,  3  cause disadvantage  to  the  person  being  impersonated  or  others,  or   4   avoid  arrest  or prosecution  Holt and Schell, 2013 . Any violation of this statute may be punished with a prison sentence of up to ten years in total.  The UK uses similar language regarding fraudulent or dishonest use in order to gain  255   advantage or cause another person to lose in some fashion in its Fraud Act of 2006. This statute applies specifically to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and also identifies three forms of fraud, including false representation of facts or laws, failure to disclose information when legally mandated, and fraud based on abuses of individual power to safeguard or protect personal or financial information  Holt and Schell, 2013 .  The  EU  Convention  on  Cybercrime   CoC   also  includes  two  articles  pertaining  to computer  forgery  and  fraud,  though  it  does  not  use  the  phrase  identity  fraud  or  theft  Brenner,  2011 .  The  CoC  requires  nations  to  adopt  legislation  criminalizing  access, input,  deletion,  or  suppression  of  data  that  leads  it  to  be  considered  inauthentic  or fraudulent, even though it would otherwise be treated as though it were authentic data  Brenner, 2011 . In addition, the CoC criminalizes the input or alteration of data and or interference with computer systems with the intent to defraud or procure economic gain and  cause  the  loss  of  property  of  another  person.  This  language  applies  directly  to various  forms  of  online  fraud  and  data  theft,  making  it  a  valuable  component  for  the development of cybercrime law globally.  Regulating fraud globally  The  myriad  forms  of  fraud  that  can  be  perpetrated,  coupled  with  the  potential  for fraudsters to victimize individuals around the world, makes this a difficult form of crime to investigate. In the USA, local law enforcement agencies may serve as a primary point of contact for a victim, as do the offices of state Attorneys General, who typically act as information  clearinghouses  for  consumer  fraud  cases.  In  addition,  states’  Attorneys General  offices  can  accept  complaints  on  behalf  of  fraud  victims  and  help  direct individuals  to  the  correct  agency  to  facilitate  investigations  when  appropriate.  It  is important to note that federal agencies will be responsible for cases where the victim and offender  reside  in  different  states  or  countries.  We  will  focus  our  discussion  on  the primary federal agencies in various nations which are responsible for the investigation of online fraud due to the fact that the majority of online fraud cases involve victims living in a separate jurisdiction from their offender  Internet Crime Complaint Center, 2009 .  The United States Secret Service  USSS   is  one  of  the  most  prominent  federal  law enforcement bodies involved in the investigation of online fraud in the USA. The Secret Service was initially part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and had a substantive role  in  investigating  the  production  of  counterfeit  currency  and  attempts  to  defraud financial  payment  systems   Moore,  2010 .  As  banks  and  financial  industries  came  to depend on technology in the 1980s and 1990s, the Secret Service increasingly investigated Internet-based forms of fraud. Today, the cyber operations of the Secret Service include the  detection,  criminal  investigations,  and  prevention  of  financial  crimes,  including counterfeiting  of  US  currency,  access  device  fraud   including  credit  and  debit  fraud , complex  cybercrimes,  identity  crimes  and  theft,  network  intrusions,  bank  fraud,  and illicit financing operations  United States Secret Service, 2017 . Financial institution fraud  256    FIF   offenses  typically  involve  the  use  of  counterfeit  currency  created  in  part  by computers  and  sophisticated  printing  devices,  as  well  as  checks  and  other  protected financial products  Moore, 2010 . Access-device fraud, whereby an individual uses credit card  numbers,  PINs,  passwords,  and  related  account  information  to  engage  in  acts  of fraud,  is  also  a  high  priority  of  the  Secret  Service.  The  practices  of  carders  are  of particular interest to the Secret Service, as the sale and use of dumps and other financial information  constitute  acts  of  access-device  fraud.  Another  area  of  interest  is  the investigation  of  general  acts  of  fraud  involving  computers  and  systems  of  “federal interest,”  such  that  they  play  a  role  in,  or  directly  facilitate,  interstate  or  international commerce  and  government  information  transfers   Moore,  2010 .  This  is  a  very  broad area  of  investigation,  including  hacking  offenses  and  the  use  of  computers  as  storage devices to hold stolen information or produce fraudulent financial materials. As a result, the Secret Service has been given the power to investigate a wide range of cybercrimes.  To help ensure successful detection, investigation, and prosecution of these crimes, the Secret Service also operates Electronic Crimes Task Forces  ECTF  and Financial Crimes Task  Forces   FCTF   across  the  country   United  States  Secret  Service,  2017 .  After  the Secret  Service  demonstrated  the  success  of  the  first  ECTF  in  New  York  City  in  1995, Congress mandated a national network of task forces be created “to prevent, detect and investigate  electronic  crimes,  including  potential  terrorist  attacks  against  critical infrastructure  and  financial  payment  systems”   United  States  Secret  Service,  2017 . Currently, there are 39 ECTFs in the USA which work together with universities, local, state,  and  federal  law  enforcement,  and  the  private  sector  to  discuss  trends  and developments  in  various  cybercrimes.  The  FCTFs  bring  together  law  enforcement agencies and the private sector to more specifically create an organized response to the threats against the US financial payment systems and critical infrastructures. As of the beginning  of  2017,  there  were  46  FCTFs  operated  by  the  Secret  Service   United  States Secret Service, 2017 .  In  addition  to  the  Secret  Service,  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  plays  a prominent  role  in  the  investigation  of  cybercrime,  including  online  fraud.  The  FBI  is considered  the  lead  federal  agency  for  investigating  various  forms  of  cybercrime   FBI, 2017 . The FBI also identified Internet fraud and identity theft as top crimes of interest  FBI, 2017 . This is a change for the Bureau, which focused on traditional forms of white- collar crime and fraud in the real world until the early 2000s, when Internet use became virtually ubiquitous across the industrialized world. The expansion of FBI investigative responsibilities into online fraud is in keeping with their general role in the investigation of  cyber-attacks  against  national  infrastructure  and  security   FBI,  2017 .  Criminal entities, terrorist groups, and even nation-states may have a vested interest in identity theft in order to fund various illicit activities and generally harm the economic safety of the nation and its citizens. Thus, both the Secret Service and the FBI now play a role in the  investigation  of  online  fraud.  This  creates  potential  investigative  challenges,  as investigators across agencies must find ways to coordinate operations in order to avoid the  duplication  of  effort  and  de-conflict  what  actors  are  cooperating  with  law  257   enforcement in compromising ongoing criminal investigations  see Box 6.12 for details .  Box 6.12 The overlapping role of the Secret Service and  the Federal Bureau of Investigation  Crime Boards Come Crashing Down  http:  archive.wired.com science discoveries news 2007 02 72585?currentPage=2.  While Thomas had been working on the West Coast for the FBI, the Secret Service’s New Jersey office had infiltrated  Shadowcrew  separately,  with  the  help  of  a  confidential  informant,  and  begun  gathering evidence against carders on that site.  This  article  provides  an  overview  of  the  relationships  between  the  FBI  and  Secret Service  in  the  investigation  and  takedown  of  the  group  “the  Shad-owcrew”  and subsequent investigations of other hacker groups.  The  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  also  houses  the  Internet  Crime  Complaint Center  IC3  within its Cyber Operations Division. The IC3 Unit is staffed by both FBI agents  and  professional  staff  with  expertise  in  the  prevention,  detection,  and investigation  of  cybercrime.  They  also  partner  with  industry  representatives,  such  as Internet  service  providers,  financial  institutions,  and  online  retailers,  as  well  as  with regulatory agencies and local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to understand the scope of various forms of online fraud. Victims can contact the agency through an online reporting mechanism that accepts complaints for a range of offenses, though the most  common  contacts  involve  non-delivery  of  goods  or  non-payment,  advance  fee fraud victimization, identity theft, auction fraud, and other forms of online fraud driven via spam  Internet Crime Complaint Center, 2017 . In turn, victims may be directed to the appropriate investigative resources to further handle complaints.  For more on the IC3, go online to: https:  pdf.ic3.gov 2015_IC3Report.pdf.  258   The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  and US Customs and Border Protection  CBP  agencies also have an investigative responsibility regarding financial crimes, fraud, and counterfeiting. Given that CBP agents monitor border crossings and ports, they serve a pivotal role in the identification of attempts to smuggle in cash and currency, as well as use or transfer fraudulent documents. ICE is the largest investigative agency within the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security Investigators, including ICE agents, investigate a wide variety of crimes in order to protect “the United States  against  terrorist  and  other  criminal  organizations  who  threaten  [US]  safety  and national  security  and  transnational  criminal  enterprises  who  seek  to  exploit  America’s legitimate trade, travel, and financial systems”  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 2017 .  In  order  to  prevent  or  investigate  terrorist  acts  and  criminal  behavior,  they investigate  the  flow  of  people,  money,  drugs,  guns,  fraudulent  items,  and  other  items across  US  national  boundaries.  Therefore,  the  ICE  and  other  HSI  investigators  play  a major  role  in  investigating  identity  crimes,  fraud,  and  smuggling   Immigration  and Customs Enforcement, 2017 .  In the UK, the primary agency responsible for managing fraud between 2008 and 2014 was  the  National  Fraud  Authority   NFA ,  which  was  formed  in  order  to  increase cooperation between both the public and private sector  National Fraud Authority, 2014 . The NFA acted as a clearinghouse for information on various forms of fraud and reports on  the  scope  of  fraud  in  any  given  year  through  the  publication  of  the  Annual  Fraud Indicator report. Through assessments of threats to the public and not-for-profit sectors, this  report  attempted  to  estimate  the  total  costs  of  fraud  to  UK  residents  each  year  National  Fraud  Authority,  2014 .  In  March  2014,  NFA  functions  were  transferred  to other  agencies   National  Fraud  Authority,  2017 .  NFA  staff  that  were  working  on strategic  development  and  threat  analysis  were  transferred  to  the  National  Crime Agency   NCA .  The  NCA  addresses  serious  and  organized  crime  in  the  United Kingdom,  including  cybercrime,  fraud,  and  other  Internet  crimes.  They  operate  the National  Cyber  Crime  Unit  which  “leads  the  UK’s  response  to  cybercrime,  supports partners  with  specialist  capabilities  and  coordinates  the  national  response  to  the  most serious  of  cyber  crime  threats”  by  working  with  Regional  Organized  Crime  Units,  the Metropolitan Police Cyber Crime Unit, industry, and law enforcement and government agencies   National  Crime  Agency,  2017 .  Within  the  NCA,  the  Economic  Crime Command  focuses  on  reducing  the  impact  of  economic  crime,  including  money laundering, fraud, and counterfeit currency, on the UK.  Action Fraud, which was housed in the NFA, was transferred to the City of London  259   Police  National Fraud Authority, 2017 . Action Fraud is a reporting service that enables citizens  and  businesses  to  file  reports  of  fraud  online  or  via  phone  and  obtain information about how to better protect themselves from being victimized. In fact, the Action  Fraud  service  is  similar  to  that  of  the  US  IC3,  in  that  victim  complaints  are forwarded to law enforcement. In this case, Action Fraud reports are examined by the City of London Police and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau  NFIB , operated by the  City  of  London  police,  for  further  investigation   Action  Fraud,  2017 .  The  NFIB collects  information  on  various  forms  of  fraud  and  aggregates  this  data  along  with reports from business and industry sources into a large database called the NFIB Know Fraud system. Analysts can query this database to generate intelligence reports on the credibility of fraud reports and develop information that may be used to pursue criminal charges or other operations to disrupt fraudsters  Action Fraud, 2017 .  For  more  fraud  www.actionfraud.police.uk report_fraud.  reporting   on   in   the  UK,   go   online   to:  Canada also uses a similar fraud reporting structure called the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre  CAFC , which is a joint effort of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ontario Provincial  Police,  and  the  Competition  Bureau.  The  CAFC  collects  reports  and complaints  on  various  forms  of  fraud,  both  online  and  offline,  from  victims  through either an online process or over the phone. The complaints received are aggregated and examined by the Operational Support Unit  OSU  to develop intelligence packages and briefs  for  Canadian  agencies  and  task  forces  that  investigate  fraud,  prepare  fraud prevention  campaigns,  and  the  private  and  public  sector  on  alternative  preventative measures to reduce the ability of fraudsters to communicate with potential victims and their ability to launder funds  CAFC, 2017 .  There  are  also  a  number  of  non-governmental  organizations  and  groups  that  offer assistance  in  dealing  with  fraud.  For  instance,  the  Anti-Phishing  Working  Group  APWG   is  a  not-for-profit  global  consortium  of  researchers,  computer  security professionals, financial industry members, and law enforcement designed to document the scope of phishing attacks and provide policy recommendations to government and industry  groups  worldwide   Anti-Phishing  Working  Group,  2017a .  The  APWG  has members from 1,800 institutions around the world, including financial institutions and treaty organizations, such as the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime and the  260   United  Nations  Office  of  Drugs  and  Crime   UNODC .  The  group  collects  statistics  on active phishing attacks provided by victims and researchers to supply information on the most  likely  targets  for  phishing  attacks  and  shares  this  information  with  interested parties  to  help  combat  these  crimes.  Furthermore,  the  APWG  operates  various conferences  designed  to  improve  the  detection,  defense,  and  cessation  of  phishing  and fraud victimization.  The Federal Trade Commission  FTC  is a key resource for consumers and victims of fraud, particularly after the passing of the Identity Theft Assumption and Deterrence Act of  1998.  The  FTC  is  an  independent  watchdog  agency  within  the  federal  government responsible for consumer protection and monitoring the business community to prevent monopolies  and  regulate  fair  practice  statutes   FTC,  2017 .  There  are  three  separate bureaus within the FTC:  1  Bureau of Competition,  2  Bureau of Consumer Protection, and   3   Bureau  of  Economics.  The  Bureau  of  Consumer  Protection  is  tasked  with  the enforcement  of  laws  related  to  consumer  safety,  fraud,  and  privacy  protection.  This Bureau is staffed by attorneys who have the power to pursue cases against various forms of fraud and identity crimes. In particular, the FTC serves as a key reporting resource for consumer  complaints  of  identity  crimes  through  both  an  online  and  telephone-based reporting  mechanism.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  FTC  does  not  pursue  individual claims  to  any  resolution.  Instead,  the  aggregation  of  reporting  information  is  used  to determine when and how federal lawsuits may be brought against specific groups or to develop  legislation  to  protect  consumers.  The  FTC  also  operates  a  spam-reporting database to help track the various scams used by fraudsters over time. Finally, they offer a variety of consumer-focused publications that discuss the risks for identity theft and ways to protect credit scores, bank accounts, and other sensitive information.  For  more  www.consumer.ftc.gov.  consumer   information   from   the  FTC,  go  online   to:  The  FTC  is  also  increasingly  involved  in  the  regulation  and  monitoring  of  online advertising campaigns. As consumers increasingly use e-commerce sites in the course of their shopping, it is vital that their rights and personal information are safeguarded from deceptive advertising practices or unfair tracking policies. For instance, the FTC filed a complaint against Sears Holdings Management Corporation, the owner of the Sears and K-Mart  retail  chains,  in  2009   FTC,  2009 .  The  suit  alleged  that  the  websites  for  both  261   stores engaged in a campaign entitled “My SHC Community” that would allow users to provide their opinions about their shopping practices and preferences. Individuals who accepted  the  invitation  were  then  asked  to  download  a  program  that  would confidentially  track  online  browsing  habits.  Consumers  would  also  be  given  $10  for leaving the application running for at least one month  FTC, 2009 .  The  user  agreement  did  not,  however,  explain  the  full  behavior  of  the  tracking program up front, which had the potential to capture consumer information, including usernames,  passwords,  credit  and  bank  account  information,  and  other  sensitive  data that the company had no need to obtain  FTC, 2009 . As a result, the FTC pursued its case  against  the  corporation  until  such  time  as  they  agreed  to  clearly  disclose  the processes  of  the  application  on  a  secondary  screen  from  the  license  agreement  and  to contact all existing users to let them know of the potential for harm, as well as allow them to remove the program. Finally, the corporation was to destroy all data obtained from consumers prior to the filing of the suit  FTC, 2009 .  There  are  similar  entities  for  data  protection  across  the  world,  such  as  the  UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office  ICO   whose main purpose is to protect the public’s information rights and privacy   ICO, 2017 , the Australian Government’s Office of the Australian  Information  Commissioner   OAIC    OAIC,  2017 ,  and  Spain’s  Agencia Española de Protección de Datos  AEPD   AEPD, 2017 . These agencies provide detailed information  on  governmental  regulations,  the  protections  that  should  be  in  place  for personal data, and what individuals should do in the event that they are victimized in some fashion. In addition, these agencies may work together to share information and investigate some forms of offending. For instance, these nations all have a collaborative working  agreement  with  the  FTC  to  collect  data  on  spam  and  other  consumer  threats  Federal Trade Commission, 2005 .  262   Summary  As  a  society,  we  have  increasingly  come  to  depend  on  the  Internet  and  computer technology to manage virtually every aspect of our financial lives. This has unparalleled benefits in that we can track expenses and monitor our purchases in near real time. Our ability to connect to others and to pay for purchases has also increased the opportunities for fraudsters to take advantage of vulnerable populations. The use of email-based scams allows  individuals  to  create  convincing  replicas  of  messages  from  legitimate  service providers and vendors. Consumers must now be extremely cautious about accepting at face value what they see in online messages. The amount of sensitive information about our  financial  and  personal  lives  that  is  now  outside  of  our  regulation  has  also  created opportunities for fraud that are beyond our control. Carders and data thieves can now victimize hundreds of thousands of people in a short space of time and gain a substantial profit from the sale of these data.  The  response  from  the  criminal  justice  and  financial  sector  to  these  crimes  has improved greatly over the past decade. There are still great challenges involved in the detection,  investigation,  and  successful  prosecution  of  these  cases  due  to  the jurisdictional challenges that may exist. Since offenders and victims can be hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away from one another, it is difficult to arrest responsible parties or  even  make  victims  whole  through  restitution.  Thus,  we  must  continually  improve consumer  awareness  of  fraud  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  victimization  and simultaneously expand the capabilities of law enforcement to respond to these crimes.

Identify the evolution of pornography in tandem with technology.   Understand the role of the Internet in prostitution.   Know the laws pertaining to obscenity and sex work.   Recognize the role of self-regulation in dealing with obscenity around the  world.  272   Introduction  As technologies have improved over the past two decades, the ability for human beings to connect in real time has increased dramatically. In the early days of the Web, BBSs and  chatrooms  gave  people  the  ability  to  talk  via  text,  though  this  lost  some  of  the context  of  facial  and  emotional  expression,  such  as  laughter  or  anger.  As  camera  and video technology evolved, so did its use online through the introduction of Skype and other video-chat programs. The inclusion of cameras in virtually all computing devices has led to the growth of social media platforms focused on sharing photos and videos with others, such as Snapchat and Instagram.  As  a  result,  an  increasingly  large  number  of  people  are  using  these  technologies  to enhance their romantic relationships or flirt with others, though this was not perhaps the intention  of  the  developers.  People  can  send  photos  or  videos  of  themselves  in provocative  outfits  or  engage  in  sexually  suggestive  activities  with  great  ease  through text  messaging.  This  activity,  colloquially  called  sexting,  has  become  popular  as  it  is perceived as a way to attract or stimulate a prospective partner with a degree of security, since it is directed toward only one recipient rather than routed through an email client, which might make the content visible to others  Mitchell, Finkelhor, Jones, and Wolak, 2012 . In fact, the impact of sexting upon popular culture may be seen in songs such as the  2016  Top-40  rap  song  by  Yo  Gotti  called  “Down  in  the  DM”  which  explores  the process of sending and receiving nude images via social media sites.  The seemingly common practice of sexting led researchers to examine the prevalence of this activity among young people. Results vary depending on the sample population, though a recent nationally representative sample of US youth between the ages of 10 and 17 found that only 2.5 percent sent pictures of themselves in a nude or nearly nude state to others, 7.1 percent had received nude or nearly nude images of others, and 5.9 percent reported receiving images of sexual activity  Mitchell et al., 2012 . By contrast, a survey of a recent sample of over 2,000 youth in New South Wales, Australia found that almost half  had  sent  a  sexual  image  or  video  of  themselves  to  another  person   Lee,  Crofts, McGovern,  &  Milivojevic,  2015 .  Almost  60  percent  of  the  same  sample  received  an image or video from another person, with the highest sexting activities reported among 13- to 15-year-olds  Lee et al., 2015 .  Regardless of the proportion of people who engage in sexting, it is important to note that the instant the photo or video is sent, it is no longer something that the sender can control.  Even  content  sent  via  social  media  sites  like  Snapchat,  which  suggest  that  no user  content  is  retained,  may  still  be  captured  via  screenshots.  A  recipient  can  easily circulate the content to others or repost the image on a social media site, like Facebook, to  embarrass  the  sender   Mitchell et al.,  2012 .  Worse  still,  a  number  of  websites  have emerged  specifically  for  individuals  to  post  sexual  images  and  videos  they  received  or  273   acquired for others to see. These sites are often referred to as revenge porn,  as  people often post content they receive from an intimate partner after a relationship sours, or by hacking someone’s phone or email account in order to acquire pictures and embarrass the sender  Halloran, 2014 .  The  release  of  revenge  porn  has  become  popular,  leading  to  the  development  of multiple websites dedicated to such content. For instance, the website IsAnyoneUp.com, which was subtitled “Pure Evil,” was created by Hunter Moore in 2010  Dodero, 2012 . He began to post pictures of a woman who continuously sent him sexual images on a blog  space  and  provided  a  link  for  others  to  submit  photos  to  be  posted.  As  content began to roll in – some from hackers, some from ex-girlfriends and boyfriends, and some from  individuals  just  interested  in  seeing  themselves  online  –  Moore  would  link  the photos  to  the  Facebook  or  Twitter  page  of  the  individual  featured   Dodero,  2012 .  The site  became  quite  popular,  though  it  drew  substantial  criticism  from  individuals  who were unwittingly featured on the site. As a result, Moore sold the site to an anti-bullying group in 2012, arguing that he was no longer able to support the site due to its expense and  the  difficulties  of  reporting  the  submitted  images  of  child  pornography  to  law enforcement. Eventually, Moore and a hacker he worked with were indicted in January 2014 in federal court on 15 counts of violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act on the  premise  that  photos  were  acquired  through  the  use  of  hacking  techniques  and identity theft  Liebelson, 2014 . Both were eventually found guilty, though some argue that  their  sentences  were  too  lenient  relative  to  the  impact  they  had  on  their  victims’ lives  see Box 7.1 for more discussion .  Box 7.1 The impact of revenge porn on its victims  https:  motherboard.vice.com en_us article xygzz7 hunter-moore-revenge-porn- victim-got-a-whopping-14570-in-restitution.  Hunter Moore Revenge Porn Victim Got a Whopping $145.70 in Restitution  The $145.70 is being paid to a single victim, identified only as L.B. Her email account was hacked in 2011 by  Moore’s  co-defendant,  Charles  Evens,  who  was  sentenced  to  25  months  in  prison  last  week.  Hunter Moore paid Evens to acquire as many hacked photos as possible.  274   This article provides a discussion about the outcome of the prosecution of Hunter Moore and Charles Evens, who published sexual images of multiple women on the website isanyoneup.com. The issue of victim restitution relative to the impact that the publication of revenge porn content has on their lives is explored, giving context to  the  need  for  greater  legal  solutions  to  assist  individuals  whose  lives  have  been affected.  Sexting  and  revenge  porn  are  just  more  recent  examples  of  the  way  in  which technology  has  been  used  to  produce  and  disseminate  sexually  explicit  content. Technological  innovation  and  sexuality  have  in  fact  been  intertwined  since  the  first human being attempted to paint on cave walls  Lane, 2000 . This relationship has been brought to the forefront, as we now use devices that can record and transmit any and all of  our  activities  to  others.  As  a  result,  this  chapter  will  consider  the  ways  in  which human beings use technology to engage in various forms of sexual expression. We will also  consider  the  impact  of  technology  upon  paid  sexual  encounters,  or  prostitution, which has been in existence since the emergence of society. Finally, we will consider the complex legal structures used to define obscenity and pornography, as well as the wide range of well-connected agencies that investigate these offenses.  275   The spectrum of sexuality online  Computer-mediated  communications  allow  individuals  to  engage  easily  in  sexually explicit discussions, view pornography  Lane, 2000 , and participate in more serious acts, including  creating,  disseminating,  downloading,  and or  viewing  pedophilia  and  child pornography   Durkin  and  Bryant,  1999;  Quayle  and  Taylor,  2002 .  In  addition,  the Internet  has  engendered  the  formation  of  deviant  subcultures  that  were  otherwise unlikely  or  limited  in  the  real  world   see  Quinn  and  Forsyth,  2005 .  Individuals  can connect  with  others  who  share  their  interests  to  find  social  support  and  information sharing.  Virtual  environments  provide  an  opportunity  for  deviants  to  connect  and communicate without fear of reprisal or scorn, though their actions may often take place in the real world  Quinn and Forsyth, 2005 .  As a result, the Internet now provides resources that cater to all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or preferences. In addition, these services can be arrayed along a spectrum from legal but deviant to highly illegal depending on the nature of the content and  the  laws  of  a  given  country   Quinn  and  Forsyth,  2005 .  For  example,  there  are  a number  of  service  providers  offering  completely  legal  resources  to  connect  individuals together, such as dating services like Match. com and plentyoffish.com. These sites allow individuals to create personal profiles noting their likes and dislikes, connect with others who  share  their  interests,  and  potentially  meet  offline  for  a  date  or  build  a  long-term relationship.  Similar  services,  however,  also  exist  that  are  designed  to  facilitate  short- term  sexual  encounters,  including  extramarital  affairs,  based  on  personal  profiles  that connect  interested  parties  together.  Websites  like  AshleyMadison.com  have  become extremely popular, despite the fact that they encourage casual sex between people who are otherwise engaged in monogamous relationships  Bort, 2013 .  In addition to content designed to facilitate relationships, there is also a great deal of pornography, defined broadly as the representation of sexual situations and content for the  purposes  of  sexual  arousal  and  stimulation   Lane,  2000 ,  available  online.  These erotic writings, photos, video, and audio content, which are easily accessible, are largely legal, but may be viewed as deviant depending on the social norms and values within a community  Brenner, 2011 . In the USA and most Western nations, pornographic content is legal so long as the participants  or those depicted in the work  are over the age of 18 and  the  consumer  is  of  legal  age.  Some  content,  such  as  sex  between  animals  and humans,  rape  or  physical  harm,  and  images  featuring  children  and  minors,  are  illegal  Quinn and Forsyth, 2013 . The lack of boundaries in online spaces, however, makes it hard to completely regulate or restrict individuals’ access to this content.  For  more  on   the   legal   status  of  pornography,  go  online   to:  276   http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Pornography_by_region.  The  availability  of  pornography  and  erotica  has  enabled  individuals  to  find  content that appeals to any interest, no matter how unusual. In fact, there is now a wide range of online  content  providers  that  cater  to  specific  sexual  fetishes,  where  individuals experience  sexual  arousal  or  enhancement  of  a  romantic  encounter  based  on  the integration of physical objects or certain situations  Quinn and Forsyth, 2013 . Fetishes can include anything from wearing high heels or a certain type of clothing  e.g., nursing or police officer uniforms , to more extreme acts, including sex with animals  bestiality  or the dead  necrophilia . The range of subjects that are now featured in pornographic content  online  has  led  to  the  concept  of  “Rule 34,”  which  essentially  states  that  “if  it exists, there is pornographic content of it”  Olson, 2012 .  The Internet also facilitates paid sexual services of all kinds which operate at varying degrees  of  legality.  The  development  of  high-speed  Internet  connectivity  and  live- streaming  video  feeds  allows  male  and  female  performers  to  engage  in  sex  shows  on demand  where  they  are  paid  for  their  time   Roberts  and  Hunt,  2012 .  Sites  like LiveJasmin  provide  access  to  cam  whores,  or  performers  who  engage  in  text-based conversations with individuals viewing them on streaming-video feeds and take requests for specific behaviors or sexual acts. In turn, the performer can be taken into a private session where the viewer pays by the minute to interact with and direct the performer to engage in various activities  Roberts and Hunt, 2012 . Although these exchanges do not involve  actual  physical  contact  between  the  provider  and  the  client,  making  the encounters  completely  acceptable  from  a  legal  standpoint,  the  acceptance  of  payment makes this a form of sex work.

For instance, clients of sex workers use forums and other CMCs to discuss the sexual services available in a location and the acts that  sex  workers  will  engage  in   Holt  and  Blevins,  2007;  Milrod  and  Monto,  2012; Weitzer, 2005 . Sex workers use websites, blogs, and email in order to arrange meetings with clients and vet them before they meet in the real world  Cunningham and Kendall, 2010 .  Although  these  communications  are  not  illegal,  laws  pertaining  to  the  act  of prostitution  vary  from  country  to  country   Weitzer,  2012 .  Some  nations,  such  as  the USA, Russia, and China, have criminalized both the sale and solicitation of sex. Other nations, including Sweden, Norway, and Canada, have made it illegal to pay for sex as a client,  though  sex  workers  can  legally  engage  in  prostitution.  Still  other  nations  have legalized  prostitution  entirely,  such  as  the  UK,  though  they  may  have  laws  against certain activities such as soliciting sex in public places  Weitzer, 2012 . For those nations that  have  criminalized  both  the  solicitation  and  sale  of  sex,  technology  is  making  it easier for both clients and providers to reduce their risk of detection and arrest.  Throughout  this  chapter  we  will  consider  the  range  of  sexual  activities  that  are facilitated  by  technology  using  examples  of  each  behavior,  though  this  will  not  be  an exhaustive description of all sexual services or preferences.  278   Pornography in the digital age  Prior  to  the  Internet  and  consumer  access  to  digital  media,  the  production  of  sexual materials was primarily limited to professional production studios and artists. Amateurs were able to write their own erotic fiction and paint or sculpt images, though they may vary in quality.  The development of audio and visual recording equipment in the nineteenth century revolutionized the creation of sexual images. No longer were individuals limited to line drawings  or  other  artistic  representations  of  sexual  images;  instead,  the  human  body could  be  represented  as  it  was  in  real  life   Yar,  2013 .  The  first  photographs  featuring nudes were popularized by Louis Daguerre of France as a means to support the training of  painters  and  other  artists.  Due  to  the  process  of  photography  at  this  time,  it  took between 3 and 15 minutes for an image to be captured, making it virtually impossible to show  individuals  engaged  in  actual  sex  acts   Lane,  2000 .  As  photographic  processing evolved  in  the  1840s  and  1850s,  the  cost  of  creating  images  decreased,  allowing  nudes and erotic photos to be sold at a cost which the middle class could easily afford. Images of  nudes  were  also  printed  on  postcard  stock  and  sent  through  the  mail  to  others, becoming colloquially known as “French postcards”  Lane, 2000 .  The  development  of  motion  picture  films  in  Europe  in  1895  was  followed  almost immediately  by  the  creation  of  the  first  erotic  films   Lane,  2000 .  In  1896,  the  film  Le Coucher de la Marie  was  made  by  Eugene  Pirou  and  showed  a  woman  engaging  in  a striptease. Shortly thereafter, European and South American filmmakers produced films featuring actual sex between couples, such as A L’Ecu d’Or ou la Bonne Auberge  from 1908 and Am Abend from 1910.  Producing erotic images or pornographic films during this period was extremely risky, as  social  mores  regarding  sex  were  very  different  from  those  of  today.  Up  until  the Victorian era of the mid-1800s, there were few laws regarding possession or ownership of sexual images and objects. In fact, the world’s first laws criminalizing pornographic content were created in the UK through the Obscene Publications Act  OPE   of  1857  Yar, 2013 . This Act made it illegal to sell, possess, or publish obscene material, which was not clearly defined in the law. Law enforcement could also search, seize, and destroy any  content  found,  which  was  a  tremendous  extension  of  police  powers  at  the  time  Lane,  2000 .  Shortly  thereafter,  similar  legal  structures  began  to  emerge  throughout Europe and the Americas in order to help minimize the perceived corrupting influence of such content on the masses.  As a way to skirt these laws, pornography producers began to market their materials as  either  artworks  or  celebrations  of  health  or  nature,  such  as  nudist  lifestyles. Gentlemen’s magazines also included images and drawings of nudes. The development of  Playboy  magazine  in  the  1950s  epitomized  the  attempt  to  combine  tasteful  nudity  279   coupled with traditional content regarding fashion, fiction, and news stories  Lane, 2000 . These  works  pushed  conventional  attitudes  toward  perceived  obscene  content  in  mass media, while underground publishers were producing images of sexual intercourse and fetish  materials  that  were  sold  through  direct  mail  and  in  less  reputable  stores.  These materials often drew the attention of law enforcement, though social standards began to soften  in  the  late  1960s  and  1970s  toward  erotica  and  pornography.  As  a  result, magazines and films became more prevalent and could be purchased at news-stands and some retailers, leading to a range of publications, from Hustler to Penthouse  Lane, 2000 . Social  attitudes  toward  obscene  content  evolved  concurrently  with  technological innovations that became available to consumers in the 1970s through the 1990s. In the 1970s,  the  development  of  the  Polaroid  instant  camera  and  relatively  affordable  home video  recording  equipment  made  it  easier  for  individuals  to  create  their  own pornographic media in the privacy of their own homes  Lane, 2000 . The creation of the video  cassette  during  the  1970s  was  also  revolutionary,  as  consumers  could  record content  using  inexpensive  recording  cameras  that  put  images  on  to  blank  tapes  rather than  film  stock.  Thus,  individuals  could  film  their  own  sexual  experiences,  and  could then  watch  them  using  video  cassette  recorders   VCRs   in  their  own  homes  on demand.  These  affordable  devices  revolutionized  the  production  of  pornography,  so much  so  that  the  pornographic  film  industry  began  to  record  using  VHS  tapes  rather than  actual  film  stock.  As  a  result,  the  industry  exploded  and  became  extremely profitable due to low costs and high-volume sales and rentals. Similarly, amateur content became increasingly possible, as consumers owned the equipment needed to make their own sex tapes at home.  As technology continued to improve in the late 1990s with the expansion of the World Wide  Web,  individuals  began  to  experiment  with  how  they  could  use  computers  and media  to  create  sexual  images  in  their  own  homes  without  the  need  for  major distribution  through  existing  publishers   Yar,  2013 .  Digital  cameras,  web  cams,  and high-speed Internet connectivity allowed individuals to develop materials to sell directly to interested parties, regardless of whether they worked with existing porn producers or on their own out of their own homes. One of the prime examples of such a story is that of  Sandra  and  Kevin  Otterson,  or  Wifey  and  Hubby,  who  have  operated  their  own pornographic website selling content they produce since 1998  Cromer, 1998 . The couple had  no  prior  involvement  in  the  porn  or  sex  industry  but  were  simply  interested  in sharing images of themselves. Kevin first posted scanned images of Polaroid pictures of his  spouse  on  a  Usenet  group  in  1997  and  received  extremely  positive  feedback  from others.  They  continued  to  post  pictures  and  eventually  started  to  sell  the  materials through direct mailing. Their website first came online in January 1998 and charged a monthly fee of $9.95 in order to access pictures, videos, and additional content that could be  purchased  through  the  real  world.  At  the  time,  the  couple  estimated  that  they  had made a few hundred thousand dollars from the sale of their content  Cromer, 1998 .  The  popularity  of  the  Web  and  computer  technology  led  to  a  massive  explosion  of adult content online. In fact, there were some questions as to the impact that immediate  280   access to porn could have upon society as a whole. A study which exacerbated this issue was  published  by  an  undergraduate  student  named  Martin  Rimm  at  Carnegie  Mellon University in 1995, and attempted to document the scope of pornography online at the time  Godwin, 2003 . His study, commonly referenced as the Carnegie Mellon Report, suggested  that  over  80  percent  of  images  on  the  Internet  involved  sexually  explicit content, which led to tremendous coverage in major news outlets, like Time  magazine and Nightline, about the threat of cyberporn  Godwin, 2003 . Policy makers began to call for restrictions on pornographic content on the Internet, creating a minor moral panic over  how  youth  may  be  corrupted  by  the  ability  to  see  porn  online.  Shortly  after  this firestorm  began,  academics  started  to  review  the  methods  employed  in  his  work  and discredited  its  findings  based  on  limited  methods  and  questionable  ethics   Godwin, 2003 .  Regardless,  Rimm’s  work  has  had  a  long-standing  impact  upon  the  perceived availability of porn on the Internet and affected legislation to deal with obscene content.

Even  now,  the  evolution  of  applications,  high-quality  digital  cameras  in  mobile phones and tablets, and online outlets are affecting the production of porn. For instance, a  recent  study  examining  130  million  Tumblr  users’  account  data  found  that approximately 22 percent of the sample intentionally consumed pornographic content on the  service,  though  only  1  percent  produced  unique  pornographic  content  themselves  Coletto, Aiello, Lucchese, and Silvestri, 2016 . The photo-sharing application Snapchat, which deletes images after being viewed by the recipient, also has a base of users who have monetized the service as a mechanism to produce pornographic photos and videos. Individuals  need  only  set  up  a  premium  account,  where  others  pay  to  view  the  user’s content  via  various  services  like  Paypal  or  Snapcash,  the  in-app  payment  system  Reynolds, 2016 .  The popularity of photos and videos taken by amateurs using mobile phone cameras, whether voluntarily or as “revenge porn,” has created a unique demand for this content. Not  only  have  professional  porn  producers  simulated  this  content  with  professional performers,  but  individuals  also  share  amateur  content  with  others  online  via  forums and file-sharing sites. The desire for amateur content may have been part of the driving force  for  the  release  of  illegally  acquired  photos  and  videos  of  multiple  celebrities  on  281   August 31, 2014  Drury, 2015 . The images appeared initially on the website 4chan, but later appeared on a range of websites around the world, and has been referred to as The Fappening  slang for masturbation , or Celebgate due to the target of the releases. The images  of  major  and  minor  celebrities  who  were  iPhone  users  were  acquired  through phishing schemes to obtain their usernames and passwords  Drury, 2015 . In turn, several hackers  gained  access  to  hundreds  of  celebrities’  content  hosted  on  the  Apple  iCloud storage  platform.  The  images  acquired  were  shared  widely  across  the  Web,  though attempts  to  remove  the  content  from  websites  or  blogs  are  always  defeated  by individuals who repost it elsewhere.  For more on the ways that celebrity data was acquired from iCloud, go online to: www.zdziarski.com blog ?p=3783.  As  technology  continues  to  evolve,  pornography  producers  have  also  attempted  to stay  current  with  new  trends.  In  particular,  the  porn  industry  is  creating  content specifically for use in Virtual Reality  VR  headsets, where individuals insert their smart phones  into  a  special  wearable  headset  cradle  that  produces  an  entirely  immersive experience  see Box 7.2 for more details . Scenes are shot specifically for VR users using multiple  cameras  and  are  edited  so  as  to  place  the  viewer  directly  into  the  scene. Regardless  of  the  acceptance  of  VR  as  a  new  media  platform,  this  example  clearly demonstrates that the landscape of porn will continue to evolve in tandem with our use of popular technologies.  Box 7.2 The rise of VR porn content  www.dailynews.com arts-and-entertainment 20170113 porn-fans-exposed-to-  282   virtual-reality-the-industrys-next-big-thing.  Porn fans exposed to virtual reality: the industry's "next big thing"  “I firmly believe virtual reality is the next big thing for the adult entertainment industry – and it will make obsolete traditional recorded two-dimensional porn,” said Alec Helmy, founder of XBIZ, an annual porn trade expo.  This  article  gives  a  brief  overview  on  the  rise  of  VR  pornography  and  its development  in  southern  California,  which  is  home  to  the  majority  of  the  global adult entertainment industry.  283   Prostitution and sex work  In  recent  years,  researchers  have  explored  the  influence  of  technology  on  what  is arguably the world’s oldest trade: prostitution. The practice of paying for sex may be viewed as a sort of labor market where there is both a demand from clients or those who pay for the encounter and those suppliers who are paid for their services.  There  is  a  range  of  providers  currently  engaged  in  the  sale  of  sexual  services,  with prostitutes who work soliciting individuals on the streets comprising the lowest rung of sex work  Lucas, 2005 . Although studies estimate that street prostitutes comprise 10 to 20  percent  of  all  sex  workers,  they  are  often  racial  minorities  who  receive  very  low wages  and  face  significantly  higher  rates  of  arrest   Alexander,  1998;  Cooper,  1989; Hampton,  1988;  Levitt  and  Venkatesh,  2007;  Rhode,  1989;  West,  1998 .  The  larger proportion  of  sex  workers  operate  behind  closed  doors  in  homes,  apartments,  and businesses   such  as  massage  parlors  and  strip  clubs ,  where  the  risk  of  arrest  is substantially lower. Finally, escorts and high-end call girls comprise the highest echelon of sex workers and are thought to make much higher wages than any other sex workers  Lucas, 2005; Moffatt, 2005; Weitzer, 2000, 2005 .  Paid sexual encounters were traditionally driven by discrete face-to-face exchanges on the street or behind closed doors in the real world. The emergence of the Internet and CMCs has revolutionized the practice by enabling providers and clients to connect on a one-to-one basis at any time. For instance, individuals can text or email sex workers to determine their availability and set up meetings. In fact, many escorts now operate their own websites and blogs, and advertise in various outlets online to attract customers.

Similarly,  the  customers  of  sex  workers  now  use  the  Web  in  order  to  communicate with others so as to gain insights into the resources available in their area and review the services  of  various  providers   Blevins  and  Holt,  2009;  Cunningham  and  Kendall,  2010;  284   Holt and Blevins, 2007; Hughes, 2003; O’Neill, 2001; Raymond and Hughes, 2001; Sharp and Earle, 2003; Soothill and Sanders, 2005 . These exchanges often occur in web forums and  review  websites  and  focus  on  the  customer  experience,  including  detailed discussions of the services offered by all manner of sex workers, as well as the attitude and behavior of prostitutes before, during, and after sex acts  Cunningham and Kendall, 2010; Holt and Blevins, 2007; Sharp and Earle, 2003; Soothill and Sanders, 2005 . There are now numerous websites where individuals can post reviews of their experiences with sex  workers,  with  names  like  BigDoggie  and  Punternet   see  Box  7.3  for  details .  In addition,  these  websites  provide  specific  details  on  the  negotiation  process  with  sex workers,  final  costs  for  various  sex  acts,  and  the  use  of  condoms  during  encounters  Cunningham and Kendall, 2010; Holt and Blevins, 2007; Sharp and Earle, 2003; Soothill and Sanders, 2005 .  Box 7.3 The role of escort review sites  Escort-review website thrive after failed sting, but women remain wary  www.nbcnews.com id 10896432 ns us_news t several-comfortable-steps-ahead- law .  The  Hillsborough  vice  unit  pioneered  the  technique  of  registering  with  escort  sites  and  posting  bogus profiles when it launched Operation Flea Collar in 2002, targeting Big Doggie, which is in its back yard. Vice officers started their own fake Web page in order to join Big Doggie.  This article provides a unique exposé on the ways in which local law enforcement in the USA uses escort-review websites as a means to investigate prostitution and sex crimes generally.  The volume of information available online provides substantive details on the largely hidden  processes  of  the  negotiations  between  clients  and  sex  workers  operating  in  the streets, as well as behind closed doors  Holt, Blevins, and Kuhns, 2013 . In addition, these posts give the client’s point of view, which is often under-examined but critical, since their demand for sexual services affects the supply available. Prospective clients of sex workers  who  access  these  forums  can  use  the  information  posted  to  evade  high-risk  285   areas while identifying and acquiring the sexual services they desire. This may decrease the success of law enforcement efforts in those nations where prostitution is illegal and, simultaneously,  increase  the  knowledge  of  prospective  customers  to  negotiate  with workers across various environments  Holt et al., 2013; Scott and Dedel, 2006 .  The clients of sex workers  The emergence of online communities that enable information sharing among the clients of  sex  workers  has  changed  the  process  of  soliciting  sex  workers.  The  development  of online  communities  allowed  individuals  to  discuss  their  preferences  and  experiences with no fear of rejection or embarrassment. In fact, research by Blevins and Holt  2009  found that there is now a subculture of clients in the USA operating in a series of web forums guided by their preferences and interests. This subculture places significant value on the notion that paid sexual encounters are normal and non-deviant. In fact, those who visited sex workers placed significant value on their experiences and knowledge of the sex trade. As a result, they would not refer to themselves as “johns” or “tricks,” as they are known in popular culture  Scott and Dedel, 2006 . Instead, forum users avoided such derogatory terms in favor of terms like “monger” or “hobbyist” to recognize that they are interested in paid sexual encounters and enjoy the experience. Individuals who posted great  detail  about  their  experiences  with  sex  workers  were  often  viewed  as  senior members.  As  a  result,  those  who  were  unfamiliar  with  the  sex  trade  can  ask  for assistance from more senior or experienced members in the forum to gain information.  In addition, the customers of prostitutes viewed sex and sex workers as a commodity, in that encounters cannot occur without payment. Thus, johns regularly referred to sex workers on the basis of where they worked, whether in streets, strip clubs, or advertised online using abbreviations such as streetwalker or SW to indicate that the worker is a street-walking  prostitute.  Similarly,  forum  users  would  include  terms  to  describe  the build and appearance of sex workers that objectify them in some fashion. In particular, forum  users  typically  discussed  the  mileage  of  a  sex  worker,  referring  to  their appearance and how it had degraded over time in the sex trade. The notion of mileage is most  often  used  in  reference  to  cars,  motorcycles,  and  vehicles,  suggesting  that customers of sex workers view the providers, first and foremost, as a commodity rather than as a person. In addition, the participants in prostitution forums focused heavily on the  costs  associated  with  various  sexual  acts  and  the  negotiation  process  between  the client and provider  see Box 7.4 for more details on the actual thoughts of a hobbyist .  286   Box 7.4 The opinions of a hobbyist in Canada  We spoke to a sex industry hobbyist, the worst kind of john  www.vice.com en_ca article we-spoke-a-sex-industry-hobbyist-theworst-kind-of- john.  I have been using the boards for about eight years. I use the review boards for one reason: to find out if there are any new girls in the hobby. Cheap whores you can find anywhere; in bars, massage parlours, strip clubs. But new girls, that still have a bit of authenticity to them, are rarer.  This  article  provides  a  unique  interview  with  a  frequent  customer  of  sex  workers who participates in multiple online forums to learn about the trade. His perspective validates some of the findings from researchers regarding the values and beliefs of the clients of sex workers in online communities.  Finally, the subculture of client-centered prostitution forums focuses on sexuality and the way in which sex is experienced. Many of the posts in these forums were dedicated to depicting the types of sex acts and services that certain prostitutes would provide in very graphic detail. The users commonly discussed the acts that providers would offer and  whether  or  not  they  used  condoms.  There  was  also  some  discussion  about  the quality  of  the  experience,  as  prostitutes  who  could  make  the  experience  feel  like  a consensual  relationship  with  no  money  involved  were  said  to  provide  girlfriend experience, or GFE  Blevins and Holt, 2009; Milrod and Monto, 2012; Sharp and Earle 2003;  Soothill  and  Sanders,  2005 .  Since  there  was  no  way  to  guarantee  that  the experience of one user would be consistent with others, some would use the term your mileage may vary  YMMV  in reference to the variation in encounters.  287   Dealing with obscenity and pornography online  Existing legislation  The  way  in  which  obscenity  is  defined  varies  by  place  and  is  heavily  dependent  on prevailing social standards. In the USA, legal definitions of obscenity have evolved over time  through  cases  reviewed  by  the  Supreme  Court.  In  fact,  the  case  of  Miller  v. California in 1973 established the definition of obscene content that is still in use today  US  Department  of  Justice,  2014 .  A  work  may  be  deemed  obscene,  and  therefore  not protected by the First Amendment right to free speech, if it meets one of the following three criteria:  1.  An average person who is capable of applying contemporary adult community standards finds that material appeals to prurient interests, defined as “an erotic, lascivious,  abnormal,  unhealthy,  degrading,  shameful,  or  morbid  interest  in nudity, sex, or excretion.”  2.  An  average  person  applying  contemporary  adult  community  standards determines  that  a  work  depicts  or  describes  sexual  conduct  in  a  patently offensive way, defined as “ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated,  masturbation,  excretory  functions,  lewd  exhibition  of  the  genitals, or sado-masochistic sexual abuse.”  3.  Lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value  US Department of  Justice, 2014 .  This  decision  provides  each  community  and  state  with  the  necessary  flexibility  to define  what  constitutes  indecent  or  obscene  materials   Tuman,  2003 .  In  addition,  it identified that there are differences between minors and adults, which require youth to be  protected  from  obscene  content.  Because  the  government  has  the  responsibility  to protect  youth  from  harmful  or  obscene  content,  the  standard  for  what  constitutes obscenity for minors is lower than that for adults. The three-pronged Miller standard still applies,  though,  in  the  context  of  standards  for  “minors,”  harmful  materials  constitute “any communication consisting of nudity, sex, or excretion”  US Department of Justice, 2014 .  A number of federal statutes are present concerning obscene content. Under Title 18  U.S.C. 1460–1470, it is a crime to:  1.  possess obscene material with the intent to distribute those materials on federal  property;  2.  import or transport obscene materials across borders;  288   3.  distribute or receive obscene material through a common carrier in interstate commerce,  including  postal  mail,  private  carriers,  or  computer  and  Internet- based services;  4.  broadcast obscene, profane, or indecent language via television, radio, or cable  and subscription television services;  5.  knowingly produce, transport, or engage in the sale of obscene, lewd, or filthy  material through interstate commerce;  6.  transfer obscene materials to minors.  The  punishments  for  these  offenses  vary  based  on  the  severity  of  the  offense   US Department  of  Justice,  2014 .  Possession  with  intent  to  distribute  obscene  materials  on federal property and broadcasting obscene content can lead to a fine and or a two-year prison sentence. All other offenses, with the exception of transferring obscene content to minors, may be punishable by a five-year prison sentence, a fine, or both  see Box 7.5 for a  review  of  some  of  the  obscenity  cases  prosecuted  over  the  past  two  decades . Individuals who are found guilty of transferring obscene content to minors may receive a prison sentence of up to ten years and or a fine  US Department of Justice, 2014 .  Box 7.5 The vagaries of prosecuting obscene content  online  Why can you go to prison for making scat porn?  www.vice.com en_au article why-is-the-guy-who-made-2-girls-one-cup-going-to- jail.  Ira Isaacs was in the same business as the creator of 2 Girls 1 Cup, and as a result, he’s been sentenced to 48 months in jail for “producing and selling obscene videos and distributing obscene videos.”  This article provides a plain-spoken review of the range of pornography creators and distributors  who  have  been  prosecuted  in  the  USA  for  making  obscene  content available  online.  It  gives  the  reader  a  clear  understanding  of  the  situations  and circumstances that are likely to lead to federal charges against pornographers.  289   In  addition,  the  USA  criminalized  the  use  of  misleading  domain  names  in  order  to draw Internet users to websites hosting sexually explicit or obscene content under the Truth  in  Domain  Names  Act  of  2003   Brenner,  2011 .  One  of  the  first  individuals arrested  under  this  law  operated  a  range  of  websites  using  domain  names  that  were misspelled versions of popular artists and intellectual property for children. For instance, his  site  www.dinseyland.com  featured  hardcore  pornography,  and  was  a  direct misspelling of the legitimate website www.disneyland.com  CNN, 2003 . The operator of the site may be imprisoned for up to two years  or up to four if the domain name was selected to intentionally attract minors to the site  and fined up to $250,000.  To demonstrate the variation in what is defined as obscene, the Obscene Publications Act  OPA  1959 for England and Wales indicates that any article may be obscene if its effect on the audience member who reads, views, or hears it is to “deprave and corrupt”  Crown  Prosecution  Service,  2014 .  The  decision  regarding  what  is  obscene  is  to  be determined  by  a  jury  without  the  assistance  of  an  expert,  which  to  a  certain  degree mirrors  the  US  concept  of  community  standards  in  establishing  obscenity   Crown Prosecution  Service,  2014 .  The  law  does  specify  that  most  depictions  of  sexual intercourse  or  fetish  activities  that  are  consensual  are  unsuitable  for  consideration  as obscene, though more serious depictions of rape, torture, bondage, degrading sexual acts such as the consumption of excreta, and sex with animals are appropriate for prosecution  Crown Prosecution Service, 2014 . This includes video, audio, and photographic images in physical print, such as magazines and DVDs, as well as content distributed over the Internet.  Individuals  who  publish  or  sell  obscene  articles  for  economic  gain  and  are  found guilty of violating this act may be fined and imprisoned for between three and five years, as  a  result  of  a  recent  enhancement  of  sentences  through  the  Criminal  Justice  and Immigration Act 2008  Crown Prosecution Service, 2014 . This Act also criminalized the possession of extreme pornography, defined as materials produced for the purpose of sexual arousal which depict acts that “threaten a person’s life; acts which result in or are likely  to  result  in  serious  injury  to  a  person’s  anus,  breasts  or  genitals;  bestiality;  or necrophilia”  Crown Prosecution Service, 2014 . For instance, acts involving the insertion of  sharp  instruments   such  as  blades  or  needles ,  mutilation  and  cutting,  choking,  or serious  blows  to  the  head  or  body  are  all  potentially  illegal  under  this  law.  This legislation  also  allows  individuals  who  possess  extreme  pornography  that  threatens  a person’s life or leads to serious injury to be fined or imprisoned for up to three years, while all other images, such as bestiality, may lead to a maximum sentence of two years in prison  Crown Prosecution Service, 2014 .  An  additional  set  of  laws  were  passed  and  implemented  in  2001,  requiring  the implementation  of  filtering  and  security  protocols  to  protect  youth.  The  Children’s Internet  Protection  Act   CIPA ,  which  covers  all  schools  that  teach  students  from kindergarten  through  twelfth  grade,  and  the  Neighborhood  Children’s  Internet Protection Act  NCIPA  which encompasses public libraries, require Internet filters in these  locations  that  block  young  people  from  accessing  harmful  content,  including  290   pornographic and obscene materials  Federal Communications Commission, 2013 . The law  also  requires  that  a  “technology  protection  measure”  be  implemented  on  every computer within the facility that is connected to the Internet, and each institution must adopt  and  implement  an  Internet  safety  policy  addressing  most  forms  of  cybercrime  Federal Communications Commission, 2013 . In the event that such filters are not put in place, the school or library may lose certain federal funding and grants.  In  addition  to  concerns  over  access  to  obscene  content  via  the  Internet,  some legislatures  have  criminalized  the  production  of  sexual  content  by  individuals  using mobile devices and digital photography. For instance, 23 US states have criminalized the act of sending sexual images of themselves to others, so long as the sender is under the age of 18  Hinduja and Patchin, 2017 . Interestingly, only nine states specifically use the phrase sexting in the language of their statutes. Sixteen of these states consider this to be a misdemeanor, while six have made it a felony depending on the circumstances of the case  and  the  nature  of  the  image.  These  laws  are  intended  to  protect  minors  from facilitating  access  to  child  pornography  and  sexual  exploitation,  though  some  critics argue they unfairly stigmatize youth for engaging in sexual behaviors that have become a somewhat normal feature of sexual relationships in the modern age. This may explain why there is no federal legislation to date involving sexting behaviors in the USA, and in most other Western nations.  Sexting behavior is also associated with the problem of revenge porn discussed earlier in the chapter  see p. 267 . Much like sexting, the distribution of sexual images without permission from their creator presents a unique challenge for lawmakers. On one side, individuals  argue  that  if  a  person  creates  the  content  her-  or  himself   but  normally herself  and sends it to others, she or he loses ownership of those images and control of whether or where those images are posted. Others argue that it is a violation of trust and that the lack of consent from the person who took the image should prevent the content from being posted elsewhere. There has been substantive public outcry over the need for criminal and civil remedies to combat this activity in nations across the globe.  The  USA  has  not  criminalized  the  non-consensual  disclosure  of  sexual  images  or content  at  the  federal  level,  though  36  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia  have developed laws  Goldberg, 2017 . Some states, like Utah, have made the release of images a  misdemeanor,  while  others,  such  as  Arizona,  have  made  it  a  felony.  In  addition,  11 states created civil statutes allowing victims to sue the individual involved in the release or threat to release content for damages, legal costs, and related fees  Goldberg, 2017 .  Several nations have criminalized posting sexual content without the authorization of the creator. For instance, France has made it illegal for a person to transmit the picture of a  person  who  is  within  a  private  place  without  their  consent   Clarke-Billings,  2016 . Canada  and  the  UK  have  similar  legislation,  though  the  UK  added  language  that  the sender must have an intent to cause distress to the individual featured in the content. In the UK, individuals found guilty could be imprisoned for up to two years and face a fine. In  fact,  1,160  incidents  of  revenge  porn  were  reported  in  England  and  Wales  between April and December of 2015, though approximately 200 people were arrested on charges  291   related to this law  Knowles, 2016 .  India’s Information Technology Act 2000 also criminalizes capturing, transmitting, or publishing  images  of  a  person’s  private  parts  without  their  consent  or  knowledge. Violating  this  statute  is  punishable  by  up  to  three  years  in  prison  or  a  fine  of  up  to 200,000 rupees. Israel may have the most severe sanctions associated with revenge porn, as the offender can be classified as a sex offender and be subject to up to five years in jail  Clarke-Billings, 2016 .  Finally, it is important to note that many nations have laws pertaining to prostitution at  both  the  local  and  federal  level.  The  sale  of  sex  has  been  criminalized,  though  the extent  to  which  it  is  enforced  is  highly  inconsistent.  Several  Southeast  Asian  nations  e.g.,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand   do  not  strictly  regulate  prostitution, making  them  an  ideal  locale  for  individuals  interested  in  sex  tourism,  particularly  for sexual  encounters  with  minors   Nair,  2008 .  In  addition,  few  nations  have  language  in their criminal codes regarding the use of technology in order to acquire or solicit sexual services.  As  a  result,  Western  nations  have  criminalized  the  act  of  sex  tourism   Nair, 2008 . For instance, the US federal criminal code  18 USC § 2423 c   criminalizes the act of traveling to a foreign country to engage in paid sexual encounters with minors. This is true  even  if  the  activity  is  legal  in  the  country  where  the  act  took  place   Nair,  2008 . Individuals  found  guilty  under  this  statute  may  be  fined  and  imprisoned  for  up  to  30 years.  In  addition,  many  Western  nations  have  criminalized  the  act  of  paying  for  sex with  minors  in  order  to  protect  youth  from  commercial  sexual  exploitation   Brenner, 2011 .  292   Self-regulation by the pornography industry  Although  almost  every  other  thematic  chapter  ends  with  a  discussion  of  the  law enforcement  agencies  responsible  for  dealing  with  investigating  violations  of  existing statutes, this chapter will differ due to the overlapping duties of agencies regarding  the crimes  discussed  in  the  next  chapter.  To  avoid  redundancy,  this  chapter  will  focus instead on the role of industry in regulating and policing the presence of obscene content online.  Currently, pornography producers are encouraged but not legally mandated to avoid exposing  individuals  under  the  age  of  18  to  obscene  content.  Prior  laws  that  were specifically designed to minimize the likelihood that minors could access porn have been overturned in the USA due to concerns over their effect on free speech rights  Procida and  Simon,  2003 .  As  a  result,  there  are  a  range  of  techniques  which  pornographic websites hosted in the USA use to reduce the likelihood that young people access their content.  In  the  1990s  and  early  2000s,  a  number  of  websites  worked  with  Age Verification Services  AVS , which would, upon entry into the website, verify the age of an individual via a valid credit card or driver’s license  Procida and Simon, 2003 .  These  services  waned  in  popularity  with  changes  in  legislation  and  the  increased availability  of  pornographic  content  via  YouTube-style  video-sharing  sites.  Individuals no  longer  needed  to  pay  to  access  pornographic  content,  as  both  users  of  content  and producers  began  to  recognize  the  popularity  of  video-sharing  sites  that  offered  such media free of charge. Instead, many pornographic websites began to provide a warning page  that  pops  up  on  screen  prior  to  entering  the  actual  website  which  requires individuals to certify that they are over the age of 18 and, therefore, legally able to access pornographic  content,  and  that  they  will  not  hold  the  site  responsible  for  obscene content. There has been no legal ruling by federal courts as to whether this constitutes an  acceptable  attempt  to  prevent  minors  from  viewing  porn.  In  addition,  a  number  of adult  websites  will  also  provide  links  at  the  bottom  of  the  pop-up  page  to  various parental  monitoring  software  programs  in  order  to  encourage  safe  surfing  habits  for youth.  The  technology  and  pornography  industries  have  also  found  ways  to  cope  with  the increasingly common problem of revenge porn. For instance, the search engine Google will  now  remove  images  and  videos  that  were  posted  without  the  creator’s  consent  if they are identified via their search results  Lee, 2015 . Victims must contact the company, but are responsive to requests and will take down the content largely claiming that the site is in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act laws governing intellectual property  see Chapter 5 regarding digital piracy laws; also Lee, 2015 . The major social media  sites  also  honor  requests  to  remove  content,  as  do  a  number  of  porn  sites  that allow users to upload content. This step has been lauded by some as a positive move by  293   the industry to police itself from illegal content, though it does not prevent people from reposting illicit content of their own.  A  final  development  in  the  way  in  which  adult  content  is  hosted  online  is  the development  of  the  .xxx  domain   Matyszczyk,  2012 .  The  creation  of  this  top-level domain,  similar  to  .com,  .net  and  .edu  websites,  provides  a  voluntary  option  for individuals  to  host  pornographic  content  online.  This  domain  was  approved  in  March 2011 and implemented in April 2011 by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers  ICANN ,  which  is  responsible  for  the  coordination  and  stability  of  the Internet over time. It was thought that the use of a .xxx domain would enable parents and  agencies  to  filter  content  with  ease,  though  some  were  concerned  that  these  sites could  be  blocked  entirely,  thereby  individuals’  rights  to  free  speech  Matyszczyk, 2012 .  limiting   The  most  recent  statistics  from  2012  suggest  that  there  are  215,835  .xxx  domains currently  registered,  though  only  132,859  of  these  sites  are  actually  adult  oriented  Matyszczyk, 2012 . A majority are also registered by businesses and industries who did not want their brand or product associated with a pornographic website. At present, it is not  clear  how  this  new  domain  space  may  be  used  or  to  what  extent  individuals  are interested  in  actually  visiting  .xxx  spaces  relative  to  those  in  the  .com  or  .net  space  Matyszczyk, 2012 . Thus, this technique used to affect access to obscene or pornographic content may change over time.  294   Summary  Taken  as  a  whole,  it  is  clear  that  any  new  technology  made  available  to  the  general public  will  be  incorporated  into  the  pursuit  of  sexual  encounters  in  some  way.  The extent  to  which  that  activity  will  lead  to  legal  troubles  varies,  based  on  who  is  being affected and how. For instance, many nations may not take issue with the production of sexually  explicit  material  featuring  consenting  adults,  so  long  as  it  does  not  involve activities  that  push  boundaries  of  taste  or  social  standards.  However,  the  use  of technology  to  potentially  embarrass  or  shame  another  who  was  featured  in  sexual content may be pursued. The constantly evolving state of technology, and its influence on  social  norms,  makes  it  extremely  difficult  to  develop  laws  related  to  its  misuse  in sexual  situations.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  need  for  constant  inquiry  into  the  nature  of sexual  offenses  in  online  and  offline  environments  to  improve  and  adapt  the  criminal code  to  new  offenses.  Likewise,  law  enforcement  must  understand  offender  behaviors and enable successful prosecution of these cases.

People  can  access  content focusing  on  virtually  any  single  element  of  an  individual’s  sexual  identity,  from  skin color to height to a performer’s age. A segment of the population has always expressed an interest in and sexual attraction toward young people  see Green, 2002 . Within adult pornography, there is a history of publications and materials focusing on “barely legal” men  and  women  who  have  just  reached  the  age  of  18.  Young  celebrities  have  also become increasingly sexualized, as with Brittney Spears and Jessica Simpson during the 1990s,  Paris  Hilton  in  the  2000s,  and  their  current  contemporaries  Selena  Gomez  and Kylie Jenner.  While  such  content  may  appeal  to  the  majority  of  individuals  with  an  interest  in young  men  and  women,  there  is  a  smaller  segment  of  the  general  population  whose interests extend to those who are much younger than 18. Although it is unknown what proportion of the population may be attracted to individuals who are under age, there is historical  evidence  that  sexual  relationships  between  adults  and  children  were considered perfectly acceptable, such as in ancient Greece and feudal Japan  Green, 2002; O’Donnell  and  Milner,  2007 .  Throughout  the  majority  of  the  twentieth  century, individuals could find print publications and films featuring children engaging in sexual poses and even penetrative intercourse with adults in various countries around the world up  until  the  early  1980s   Tate,  1990 .  For  instance,  the  USA  only  criminalized  the production and commercial dissemination of sexual images of children in 1977.  The stigmatization of individuals who were attracted to children led to the formation of advocacy groups which wanted to eliminate any laws related to the age of consent to engage in sexual acts. One of the more notable of these groups formed in 1978 and called itself  the  North  American  Man-Boy  Love  Association   NAMBLA .  The  individuals who  founded  the  group  argued  that  it  is  implausible  that  anyone  under  a  certain  age cannot understand or truly express their desire for an emotional or romantic relationship  Pearl,  2016 .  Similar  groups  may  be  found  across  the  globe,  such  as  the  Australian Man Boy Love Association and Vereniging Marijn in the Netherlands.  Many  of  these  groups  eventually  disbanded  either  owing  to  law  enforcement crackdowns  or  social  pressure,  but  their  general  ideas  persisted  due  in  part  to  the connective  power  of  the  Internet  and  computers.  Despite  the  criminalization  of pornographic  content  featuring  children  in  some  but  not  all  countries,  anyone  who  is attracted to young people can find others who share their interests online  International Center  for  Missing  and  Exploited  Children,  2016 .  The  Internet  became  a  hub  for  the distribution of sexual images of children, and public anxiety grew over the potential that children could be solicited online to engage in sexual acts in the real world. This issue  303   was exemplified by the popularity of the show To Catch a Predator, where undercover police  would  pose  as  an  underage  girl  in  various  chatrooms  online  and  engage  in conversations with individuals who wanted to have sex with them. Eventually, the “girl” would invite the person they chatted with to their home under the pretense of a physical meet-up, only to be met by the show’s host, Chris Hansen, and police officers to arrest the individual  see Box 8.1 for additional details .  Box 8.1 The practices of To Catch a Predator  www.nbcnews.com id 14824427 ns dateline_nbc t theyre-still- showing .UAUeSF2zm94.  But  his  journey  didn’t  begin  that  day  –  it  began  more  than  a  week  earlier  when  he  entered  a  Yahoo Georgia chat room and decided to hit on a decoy, an adult posing as a 15-year-old. It didn’t take long for the 23-year-old, screenname “scoobydooat101”, to steer the chat towards sex.  This  article,  written  by  Chris  Hansen  who  was  the  host  of  To  Catch  a  Predator, explains  how  the  show  was  able  to  identify  and  draw  in  individuals  who  were interested in sexual relationships with young people. Readers will understand a little more about the motivations of individuals who came into contact with the show’s undercover operatives and how they worked with police to make arrests.  This chapter elaborates on both the role of the technology in the creation, distribution, and access to sexual content featuring children, as well as the nature of the communities that  support  or  justify  sexual  attractions  to  young  people.  This  chapter  provides  an overview  of  the  ways  in  which  pornography  featuring  adults  differs  from  that  of children,  as  well  as  the  various  ways  in  which  individuals  use  child  pornography,  not only for personal use but to assist in developing sexual relationships with children online or offline. We also examine the laws used to prosecute child sexual exploitation, and the organizations  and  law  enforcement  agencies  that  investigate  these  crimes  across  the globe.  304   Defining and differentiating child porn from obscene content  As  noted  in  Chapter  7,  the  Internet  and  digital  media  played  a  pivotal  role  in  the production of pornography featuring consenting adults and created controversy around the ease of access to lewd or obscene content. This discussion pales in comparison to the social  panic  surrounding  the  availability  and  distribution  of  pornographic  content featuring children via the Web  Lynch, 2002; Quinn, Forsyth, and Mullen-Quinn, 2004 . Child pornography  is  defined  as  the  depiction  of  “the  sexual  or  sexualized  physical abuse  of  children  under  16  years  of  age  or  who  appear  to  be  less  than  16  that  would offend a reasonable adult”  Krone, 2004: 1 . This content may include both video and still photos,  and  in  some  countries  content  featuring  computer-generated  or  simulated depictions of children.  The fact that children are the focus of the sexual nature of these images, as both the subject  of  the  work  and  a  participant  in  the  acts,  makes  this  content  different  from traditional obscene content outlined in Chapter 7. Although both forms of content may involve expressions of sexuality, they differ in the ways in which participants come to engage  in  the  acts  depicted.  For  instance,  participants  in  obscene  images  and pornography largely give their consent to engage in sexual acts and be photographed or videotaped doing so. Individuals under the age of 16 are unable to fully understand the implications of their actions, particularly infants, toddlers, and young children who may not  be  able  to  verbally  communicate.  Their  naivety  and  inability  to  comprehend  the nature of any act makes children unable to give their consent to engage in sexual acts, particularly with adults.  An additional difference lies in the fact that obscene content featuring adults is often produced with compensation provided to the participants. An adult participant may have circumstances that force them to engage in such acts, whether serious debt or personal hardships, but they receive some sort of benefit for their efforts. In comparison, an adult will subvert the trust children have in order to force or convince them to engage in an act. When an adult, who is seen as a protector or mentor, manipulates a minor’s trust in this manner the loss of boundaries leads to psychological harm to the child  see Sinanan, 2015 . For instance, some may attempt to convince a child that sexual acts with adults are perfectly natural in order to assuage concerns that they are doing something wrong. Some may prey upon fear, and tell children that they will inform their parents and get them into trouble for whatever activity they have engaged in. Others may simply force the  child  to  engage  in  an  act  against  their  will.  Overall,  the  production  of  child pornography results in both psychological and physical trauma to the victims.  These  factors  make  the  production  and  consumption  of  child  pornography  a particularly  heinous  crime,  unlike  the  production  of  obscene  or  pornographic  content.  305   The  differences  that  underlie  these  materials  have  led  some  agencies  to  encourage  the use of different terms to refer to images of children engaging in sexual acts. For instance, Interpol  and  Europol  use  the  term  child  sexual  abuse  material  to  refer  to  what  is otherwise  considered  child  pornography  on  the  basis  that  since  children  are  unable  to give consent, and are being harmed physically and emotionally, the phrase pornography is reductive and unfair to the victims. The inclusion of the words “sexual abuse” clearly recognizes  the  harm  and  severity  of  the  nature  of  the  crimes  depicted  in  images  and videos, and are essential to protect victims from further harm  Interpol, 2017 .  It must be noted that child pornography is a legal definition that extends to certain images  focusing  on  sexual  acts  or  sexualized  images  of  children.  Individuals  who actively  seek  out  sexual  images  of  children  frequently  access  content  that  exists  on  a similar continuum of obscene content featuring adults. This was demonstrated through the  development  of  the  COPINE   Combatting  Paedophile  Information  Networks  in Europe  Scale to categorize sexual content on the basis of the harm involved in erotica and  pornographic  content  involving  children   Taylor,  Holland,  and  Quayle,  2001a . Initially, researchers developed this scale as a tool to assist in the delivery of therapeutic treatment, as there may be different cognitive therapies to employ based on the nature of the images an individual actively obtained. The model was eventually adapted as a tool for researchers and law enforcement to classify content on a scale from 1 to 10, with one being the least severe and 10 being the most severe  see Box 8.2 for details; Taylor et al ., 2001a and 2001b . The COPINE Scale categories were created after analyzing collections of child pornography images found on offender computers.  Box 8.2 The 10-Point COPINE Scale  Level – 1 Type – Indicative Description  –  Non-erotic  and  non-sexualized  pictures  showing  children  in their  underwear,  swimming  costumes  from  either  commercial  sources  or family albums. Pictures of children playing in normal settings, in which the context  or  organization  of  pictures  by  indicates inappropriateness.  the  collector   Level – 2 Type – Nudist Description – Pictures of naked or semi-naked children in appropriate nudist  settings, and from legitimate sources.  Level – 3 Type – Erotica Description – Surreptitiously taken photographs of children in play areas or other  safe  environments  showing  either  underwear  or  varying  degrees  of nakedness.  306   Level – 4 Type – Posing Description  –  Deliberately  posed  pictures  of  children  fully  clothed,  partially clothed  or  naked   where  the  amount,  context  and  organization  suggest sexual interest .  Level – 5 Type – Erotic Posing Description – Deliberately posed pictures of fully, partially clothed or naked  children in sexualized or provocative poses.  Level – 6 Type – Explicit Erotic Posing Description  –  Pictures  emphasizing  genital  areas,  where  the  child  is  either  naked, partially clothed or fully clothed.  Level – 7 Type – Explicit Sexual Activity Description – Pictures that depict touching, mutual and self-masturbation, oral  sex and intercourse by a child, not involving an adult.  Level – 8 Type – Assault Description  –  Pictures  of  children  being  subjected  to  a  sexual  assault,  involving digital touching, involving an adult.  Level – 9 Type – Gross Assault Description – Grossly obscene pictures of sexual assault, involving penetrative  sex, masturbation or oral sex, involving an adult.  Level – 10 Type – Sadistic Bestiality a. Pictures showing a child being tied, bound, beaten, whipped or otherwise  subjected to something that implies pain.  b. Pictures where an animal is involved in some form of sexual behavior with  a child.  Images that fall into the first three categories of the COPINE Scale are generally non- sexual, and may include images of children swimming, changing clothes, or in various states  of  undress   Taylor  et  al.,  2001a  and  2001b .  Such  content  could  be  produced surreptitiously by an offender, or acquired from parents, friends, family members, print media, advertisements, as well as social media sites online. Content that meets the legal definition of child pornography begins in category 4, and focuses more on sexual acts or sexualized images featuring children, including sexualized poses or masturbation  Taylor et al.,  2001a  and  2001b .  The  content  we  may  consider  as  the  most  extreme  begins  in category  8,  and  features  overt  sexual  acts  involving  adults,  other  children,  or  even  307   animals. This content also includes children being violently raped, abused, or tortured in a sexual fashion.  Although  it  may  seem  unconscionable  to  view  such  images,  let  alone  create  them, there  is  a  demand  for  this  content  within  the  community  of  child  pornography consumers  Seigfried-Spellar, 2013 . This was evident in the takedown of a group called The  Dreamboard,  which  operated  a  forum  where  individuals  could  view  and  share images of child sexual abuse that was categorized by the nature of the content. The most depraved  content  on  the  site  was  listed  under  the  title  “Super  Hardcore”  and  featured images of adults engaging in sexual acts which clearly caused the victims physical and emotional distress  see Box 8.3 for more on efforts to eliminate this group .  Box 8.3 Details on Operation Delego  www.justice.gov opa pr 2011 August 11-ag-1001.html.  The board rules also required members to organize postings based on the type of content. One particular category was entitled “Super Hardcore”[.] involving adults having violent sexual intercourse with “very young kids”[.] “in distress, and or crying.”  This  press  release  details  a  massive  investigation  of  an  international  child pornography  distribution  network  operating  online  called  The  Dreamboard. Individuals  participated  in  this  community  from  around  the  world,  and  were required to post content in order to remain active users. The scope of this group, the harm  they  caused,  and  the  extent  of  content  hosted  demonstrate  the  variety  of content that may be classified as child pornography.  308   The role of technology in child pornography and exploitation  While  child  pornography  existed  well  before  the  creation  of  the  Internet,  the globalization  of  technology  has  created  an  environment  where  Internet  child pornography is readily available, accessible, and affordable, if not entirely free of charge  Cooper, 1998 . In essence, viewing child pornography is an easy crime to commit and an easier  crime  to  get  away  with.  It  is  difficult  to  assess  the  total  number  of  child pornography images that may be available at any given time online due to the existing laws regarding access to this content. Older estimates suggested that there were 20,000 images  of  child  pornography  posted  on  the  Internet  each  week   Pittaro,  2008;  Rice- Hughes, 2005 . More recent statistics from the UK suggest that there were 68,092 specific URLs and 448 news groups that were confirmed to contain child sexual abuse images in 2015  alone   IWF,  2016 .  In  addition,  it  appears  that  child  pornography  is  a  worldwide problem which allows individuals in multiple nations to acquire content from anywhere. The  availability  of  digital  photography,  webcams,  high-speed  Internet  connections, editing software, and removable storage media make it possible for individuals to create high-quality images and videos of deplorable acts of sexual abuse involving children for consumption around the world.  A  substantial  proportion  of  child  pornography  currently  circulating  on  the  Internet appears  to  be  shared  via  peer-to-peer  file-sharing  programs,  including  BitTorrent  WCSC, 2013 . This same software used to distribute pirated media  see Chapter 5  is a regular venue for sharing traditional pornographic videos and images, as well as images featuring children. Although the same tools are used to distribute pirated media as they are to download child pornography, it is unlikely that the average person would identify and  download  child  pornography  files  by  accident.  Individuals  actively  seeking  child pornography  use  keyword  searches  used  to  label  images,  videos,  and  file  sets  that  are distinct from other content  IWF, 2017 .  The  growth  of  various  voice  over  IP,  video-calling  services,  and  applications  has engendered the growth of services to stream child sexual abuse as it happens. The same resources that are used by standard consumers for interpersonal communication, ranging from Skype to FaceTime to Periscope, can now be used to let individuals watch people engage in sexual acts with children. Even worse, these services often allow viewers to direct the action as it happens, suggesting certain sex acts occur or to comment on what they are seeing  see, e.g., Box 8.4 . Many of these streaming services appear to originate from and operate out of Southeast Asian nations, in many cases involving parents and their  children  rather  than  some  large-scale  criminal  organization.  For  instance,  there were 57 criminal cases for live-streaming abuse against actors in the Philippines in 2013, though this number rose steadily to 167 in 2015 alone  Holmes, 2016 . One reason why  309   these streams may have grown is that the operators can make individuals pay for access using  online  payment  systems  or  cryptocurrencies.  The  profits  made  from  streaming may enable families to gain access to simple comforts and resources they were otherwise not able to afford. As a result, it may be difficult to deter the abusers who enable these behaviors.  Box 8.4 Live-streaming sexual abuse content  Pace administrator busted for watching live child porn  www.nydailynews.com new-york pace-administrator-busted-watching-live-child- porn-article-1.2600912.  Scott  Lane,  34,  executive  director  of  donor  relations  and  fund-raising  programs  for  Pace  University,  is accused  of  watching  the  sickening  show  from  his  Hell’s  Kitchen  apartment  under  the  Internet  handle “NYC Perv” – and at times even directed the action.  This article details the activities of a man in New York City who was arrested for watching and commenting on a live-stream feed of a boy being sexually assaulted. The disturbing nature of this technology is evident in this story, detailing how the viewers engaged with the people who were actively assaulting the child.  Social  media  sites,  like  Facebook,  also  serve  as  a  platform  for  the  identification  of images of children. Much of this content may be innocuous, featuring images of children playing, swimming, or taking baths. Such images may be acquired easily from friends, family, and associates with children who regularly share media. The rise of image-based messaging applications like Snapchat, Kik, and Periscope are also creating opportunities for  individuals  to  actively  solicit  images  from  children  as  well   see  Chapter  12 . Interested individuals can use these applications as a platform to target youth based on information  provided  in  their  profile,  and  then  begin  to  chat  with  them.  The conversations are intended to build a rapport between the adult and child, and enable the adult  to  actively  solicit  the  youth  to  send  them  images  of  themselves  in  various  poses and  activities   see  Box  8.5  for  an  example .  Some  may  even  attempt  to  use  their connection to eventually meet the child offline so that they may engage in sexual acts with them in person.  310   Box 8.5 Understanding attempts to solicit youth into  documenting sexual acts  Man pleads guilty to producing child porn  www.waynesvilledailyguide.com news 20170201 man-pleads-guilty-to-producing- child-porn.  On June 20, 2014, a search warrant was obtained for Coons’s Face-book account and Facebook provided investigators with more than 8,000 pages of private messages exchanged between Coons and others. Many of the messages were from young girls between the ages of 11 and 17. Coons asked several of the girls to send him pictures of themselves without clothes on.  This story details the investigation and arrest of a Missouri man named Tyler Coons for  soliciting  children  via  social  media  sites  into  sharing  images  of  themselves engaging in sexual acts. This report details how his activities were identified by a concerned parent and the process of his arrest and subsequent prosecution.  There is also a great deal of child pornography hosted on the Dark Web, referencing the portion of the Internet operating on the specialized encrypted software platform Tor  see Chapter 1; also Cox, 2016 . One reason for the increased use of Tor is likely due to the difficulty law enforcement agencies may initially have in identifying the location of content  hosting  services  and  users.  Individuals  can  only  access  the  Dark  Web  by downloading  and  using  the  free  Tor  browser,  which  anonymizes  the  IP  address  and location details of the user  Barratt, 2012 . Individuals can host any content they want on Tor using home-brew servers operating out of their homes, which conceals the physical location of the hosting site. In addition, Tor-based content is not indexed by Google or other  search  engines,  making  it  difficult  to  quantify  the  amount  of  material  available online  Barratt, 2012 .  As a result, some child pornography-sharing communities have shifted to Tor in an attempt to conceal their actions from law enforcement. Federal agencies, such as the FBI, however,  are  taking  somewhat  extreme  steps  to  identify  child  porn  groups  and  their participants,  including  essentially  hacking  the  Tor  infrastructure  in  order  to  capture sensitive  user  information.  Such  steps  may  challenge  the  admissibility  of  evidence acquired  and  force  investigators  to  be  more  transparent  in  how  a  takedown  operation  311   was performed  see Box 8.6 for details .  Box 8.6 The complex techniques required to investigate  Dark Web child porn  Playpen: the story of the FBI's unprecedented and illegal hacking operation  www.eff.org deeplinks 2016 09 playpen-story-fbis-unprecedented-and-illegal- hacking-operation.  In December 2014, the FBI received a tip from a foreign law enforcement agency that a Tor Hidden Service site called “Playpen” was hosting child pornography. That tip would ultimately lead to the largest known hacking operation in U.S. law enforcement history.  This article explains the FBI’s investigation of the child porn-sharing group called Playpen that operated on the Dark Web. The FBI would not only begin to host the site on their servers facilitating the distribution of child pornography, but also send malware  to  site  participants  to  infect  their  browsers  and  capture  information  on their location. This article, written by the Electronic Freedom Foundation, explores the  risky  nature  of  this  investigation  and  the  negative  consequences  that  extreme investigative  tactics  may  have  for  all  citizens,  regardless  of  their  participation  in criminal activities.  312   Explorations of the pedophile subculture online  Computers  have  clearly  become  the  preferred  medium  for  those  individuals  with  a sexual interest in children by allowing them a degree of anonymity and minimal fear of social stigma or legal ramifications for disclosing their preferences  Alexy, Burgess, and Baker, 2005; Durkin, 1997; Durkin and Hundersmarck, 2007; Holt, Blevins, and Burkert, 2010;  Rosenmann  and  Safir,  2006 .  These  deviant  subcultures  take  part  in  a  variety  of computer crimes involving children, ranging from using the Internet as a way to reach out and develop emotional and sexual relationships with children   Jenkins, 2001 , to the distribution, trading, and production of child pornography  Durkin, 1997; Jenkins, 2001; Quayle and Taylor, 2002; Taylor, Quayle, and Holland, 2001b .  Individuals  interested  in  relationships  with  prepubescent  or  pubescent  children  may be classified as pedophiles or hebephiles, respectively, according to the diagnostic criteria established  by  the  American  Psychological  Association’s  Diagnostic  and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – 5th edition  DSM-5; APA, 2013 . Specifically, the DSM-5 introduced  the  concept  of  pedophilic  disorder,  which  is  diagnosed  using  the  following criteria:  1.  Over  a  period  of  at  least  six  months,  recurrent,  intense  sexual  arousing fantasies,  sexual  urges,  or  behaviors  involving  sexual  activity  with  a prepubescent child or children  generally age 13 years or younger .  2.  The  person  has  acted  on  these  sexual  urges,  or  the  sexual  urges  or  fantasies  cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.  3.  The person is at least 16 years old and at least five years older than the child or  children in the first criterion  APA, 2013 .  The  individual  must  demonstrate  all  three  criteria  in  order  to  be  diagnosed  as  a pedophile in clinical settings. The DSM-5 also subdivides the pedophilia diagnosis into more  specific  categories:  sexually  attracted  to  males,  females,  or  both  sexes,  exclusive  attracted only to children  or non-exclusive  attracted to both adults and children , or limited to incest  APA, 2013; O’Donohue, Regev, and Hagstrom, 2000 .  The  implementation  of  the  term  disorder  in  this  edition  of  the  DSM  is  important because  it  identifies  that  an  individual  has  acted  on  their  specific  urges.  Such  a behavioral  criterion  was  not  present  in  previous  editions  which  only  identified pedophilia as a clinical paraphilia or condition. The APA was criticized for this inclusion criterion as it does not clearly delineate between those who have engaged in sexual acts with  children  and  those  who  have  sought  out  child  pornography  for  masturbatory purposes  e.g., Berlin, 2014 . This kind of vague language is insufficient for what is meant to be a diagnostic tool for clinicians.  Regardless of clinical classification, individuals who engage in either sexual activities  313   with or fantasize about children are considered to be among the most hated deviants in society   Durkin,  1997;  Durkin  and  Bryant,  1999;  Holt  et  al.,  2010;  Jenkins,  2001; Rosenmann and Safir, 2006 . Adults who show a strong sexual interest toward children are, therefore, stigmatized by society and retreat into the virtual world to express their true feelings, since the Internet can offer almost complete anonymity. Those who share these  taboo  sexual  feelings  come  together  to  form  what  is  known  as  the  “pedophile subculture”   Jenkins, 2001; Pittaro, 2008 . It is here where members of the subculture feel they are part of a group that accepts them for their sexual interests. In fact, they can gain validation for their sexual beliefs.  In his 2001 book Beyond Tolerance: Child Pornography On the Internet, Philip Jenkins examined a BBS where individuals exchanged images of child pornography and found a subculture  where  individuals  shared  beliefs  about  the  value  of  child  pornography  and the need to exchange these materials and socialized individuals into this activity. Jenkins wrote, “Joining the subculture marks less an entry into new activities and interest than an escalation of pre-existing behaviors, supported by a new sense of community”  2001: 106 .  These  are  individuals  seeking  acceptance;  the  anonymous  nature  of  the  Internet offers this. Users expressed fears of being detected by law enforcement, political reviews, and  even  a  shared  language.  Jenkins  observed,  “one  is  likely  to  acquire  gradually  the peculiar language, mores, and thought patterns of this world and thus be inducted subtly into  the  subculture”   2001:  108 .  In  order  to  keep  up  with  the  language  and  the  rapid change of discussion, users must visit and participate regularly if they hope to benefit from this subculture.  Support,  justification,  and or  rationalization  are  also  common  among  pedophile subcultures   Durkin  and  Bryant,  1999;  Holt  et  al.,  2010;  Jenkins,  2001;  Mayer,  1985 . Mayer wrote, “One striking characteristic of the pedophile is the ability to minimize or rationalize his activities”  1985: 21 . Most individuals belonging to such subcultures see nothing  wrong  with  relationships  between  adults  and  children;  in  fact,  they  see  many positive benefits from these interactions, such as being a positive role model in a child’s life     Jenkins,  2001 .  They  often  do  not  associate  themselves  with  pedophiles  or  child molesters and even condemn these individuals themselves. These individuals justify this type of sexual orientation by using the term “child love” to describe what they perceive to  be  a  perfectly  normal  relationship  between  adult  and  child,  which  does  not  always have to involve sexual activity  Holt et al., 2010; Jenkins, 2001 .  Pedophiles will also use neutralization strategies in attempts to normalize their type of deviance. For example, they may attempt to deny whether a “victim” existed  “denial of the victim”  by rationalizing that the children were asking for or wanted sex. They may also  use  a  technique  called  “denial  of  injury,”  saying  that  sexual  encounters  can  be rewarding  and  even  educational  for  children     Jenkins,  2001 .  Some  groups  have  even gone so far as to compare themselves to the Jewish population being hunted down by the Nazis  in  Germany;  they  believe  that  sexual  attraction  to  children  is  much  more widespread than society cares to accept, and by persecuting them, society is preaching hypocrisy  Jenkins, 2001 .  314   The  idea  that  “child  love”  is  different  from  being  a  pedophile  in  the  eyes  of  these individuals is a topic that has been examined more recently by researchers  Holt et al., 2010;  Jenkins,  2001 .  Many  members  of  the  child  pornography  discussion  boards examined by Jenkins  2001  did not see themselves as pedophiles. In one thread, a user identified  as  “Humbert  Humbert”  wrote,  “Am  not  a  pedo,  just  like  the  beauty  of  pre- pubescent adolescent girls. Therefore, I don’t think I am a perv. Just rational minded”   Jenkins, 2001: 119 . They believe that those who actually abuse children represent only a small  minority  of  their  community  and  that  most  users  are  just  looking,  not  acting  Jenkins, 2001 .  It is hard to determine which members of these communities are or have actually been physically   sexually   involved  with  children,  since  the  majority  of  users  do  not  reveal any  illegal  behavior  that  may  have  occurred  for  fear  of  legal  ramifications   Jenkins, 2001 . However, the concept of sharing fantasies, urges, and non-sexual interactions with children is seen in most of the pedophile online communities  Holt et al., 2010; Jenkins, 2001 .  While  most  research  and  investigations  have  focused  on  targeting  those  who possess trade  child  pornography  and or  child  molesters,  few  have  considered  the members of the online pedophile subculture who do not consider themselves pedophiles or child molesters but “child lovers”  Holt et al., 2010 .  Typologies of child pornography use and consumption  Given the substantial concern over the rise of child pornography in online environments, researchers  have  examined  characteristics  of  individuals  who  consume  child pornography. Although it may be counter-intuitive, Internet child pornography users are not necessarily pedophiles  i.e., sexually attracted to children  or child sex offenders  i.e., hands-on  contact  offenders:  Babchishin,  Hanson,  and  Hermann,  2011;  Klain,  Davies, and  Hicks,  2001;  Frei,  Erenay,  Volker,  and  Graf,  2005;  McCarthy,  2010 .  Internet  child pornography  users  may  be  motivated  by  curiosity,  addiction  or  financial  profit  rather than  by  a  sexual  interest  in  children   Taylor  and  Quayle,  2003 .  In  addition,  research indicates  that  Internet  child  pornography  users  are  not  more  likely  to  cross  over  into contact offending  see Seto and Eke, 2005; Webb, Craissati, and Keen, 2007 .  According  to  Seto,  Hanson,  and  Babchishin   2011 ,  child  pornography  users   i.e., hands-off  or  Internet-only  offenders   are  significantly  less  likely  to  reoffend  and  have prior criminal histories of contact offenses compared to contact child sex offenders  i.e., hands-on .  However,  research  suggests  that  they  are  more  likely  to  exhibit  pedophilic characteristics  compared  to  contact  child  sex  offenders   Babchishin,  Hanson,  and VanZuylen, 2015; Seto, Wood, Babchishin, and Flynn, 2012; Seto, Cantor, and Blanchard, 2006; Sheldon and Howitt, 2005 .  Researchers  have  used  various  data  to  further  understand  the  dynamics  between online  and  offline  offender  groups.  In  general,  individuals  who  only  consume  child pornography appear to differ from those who either engage in real-world offenses only,  315   or who engage in both offense types. Online-only offenders are more likely to be young, single,  white  males  who  are  unemployed  and  who  have  greater  empathy  for  sexual abuse  victims   Babchishin et al.,  2011 .  Their  level  of  empathy  may  be  key  in  keeping them from engaging in contact offenses in the real world, as it appears that individuals who view child pornography report higher pedophilic interests generally  Babchishin et al.,  2015 .  People  who  engage  in  offenses  online  and  offline  report  slightly  higher pedophilic interest levels than those who only view child pornography, which may be an important behavioral driver  Babchishin et al., 2015 .  Online offenders also demonstrate a greater range of sexual deviance which may be associated  with  their  interest  in  various  sexual  content   Babchishin  et  al.,  2011 .  This may also be associated with the fact that online offenders are also more likely to report either having a homosexual or bisexual orientation  Babchishin et al., 2015 . Importantly, both  online  and  off-line  offenders  are  more  likely  to  report  sexual  and  physical  abuse than  men  in  the  general  population.  This  is  sensible,  since  there  is  a  high  correlation between  some  history  of  abuse  and  sexual  offending  behaviors  generally   Jespersen, Lalumière, and Seto, 2009 .  Overall, not all child pornography users are pedophiles or contact child sex offenders, and child pornography users are not significantly more likely to cross over into contact child  sex  offenses.  In  addition,  some  research  suggests  that  they  may  exhibit  more pedophilic  characteristics  than  contact  child  sex  offenders   Babchishin  et  al.,  2015; Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2002; Klain et al., 2001; Perrien, Hernandez, Gallop, and Steinour, 2000; Quayle and Taylor, 2002; Seto et al., 2006; Seto and Eke, 2005 . However, these  previous  studies  sampled  child  pornography  users  from  the  clinical  or  forensic population.  Other  researchers  have  relied  on  self-report  measures  using  anonymous surveys to assess the prevalence of child pornography use among general Internet users, with results suggesting that anywhere between 6 and 10 percent of Internet users admit to  intentionally  consuming  child  pornography   Seigfried,  Lovely,  and  Rogers,  2008; Seigfried-Spellar, 2015, 2016 .  Recognizing that child pornography users are not a homogeneous group, researchers developed typologies to classify individuals based on their collecting behaviors  Alexy et al.,  2005;  Durkin,  1997;  Krone,  2004;  Quayle  and  Taylor,  2002;  Rogers  and  Seigfried- Spellar, 2013; Taylor and Quayle, 2003 . It is thought that viewing and collecting child pornography and related material can possibly lead to more serious offenses, and may produce  varied  uses  for  this  content,  whether  online  or  offline.  One  of  the  first  such typologies was proposed by Durkin  1997: 16  with four categories based on individual misuse of the Internet and its role in offline activities:  1  trafficking child pornography  traders ;  2  communicating and sharing ideas with like-minded persons  networking ;  3   engaging  in  inappropriate  communication  with  children   grooming ,  and   4  attempting to find children to molest  travelers .  An  expanded  model  was  proposed  by  Krone   2004   focusing  on  offenders’  use  of technology  to  view,  collect,  share,  and or  produce  child  pornography,  as  well  as  their level  of  technical  competency,  the  nature  of  the  images  they  seek,  their  social  316   connectivity to others interested in child porn, and the extent to which they attempt to hide their activities from law enforcement. In this respect, Krone’s typology builds from Durkin,  but  also  provides  greater  depth  and  potential  accuracy  in  assessing  offender behavior.  This  nine-category  typology  recognizes  the  following  types:   1   browser,   2  private fantasy,  3  trawler,  4  non-secure collector,  5  secure collector,  6  groomer,  7  physical  abuser,   8   producer,  and   9   distributor.  It  is  not  intended  for  use  in  clinical treatment  or  diagnostic  purposes,  but  rather  to  classify  misuse  of  technology  and involvement  in  the  production  of  child  pornography  and  sexual  abuse  for  law enforcement.  The first two categories involve individuals with no social connections to others and at  the  same  time  do  not  take  steps  to  hide  their  activities  from  law  enforcement.  The browser  views  child  pornography  accidentally,  but  saves  the  content  deliberately  for later use. The private fantasy user creates their own materials so that they can use it for personal reasons later. This content is not meant to be viewed by others or deliberately shared, and may include stories, line drawings, or computer-generated images or videos. The  next  three  categories  involve  individuals  deliberately  searching  for  child pornography  and  sexual  content,  though  they  may  have  generally  lax  security.  The trawler searches actively for child pornography through various browsers, as they have generally few connections to others to facilitate access to content and take no steps to conceal their activities. The non-secure collector is technologically savvy and uses peer- to-peer  file-sharing  programs  and  other  more  secured  sources  to  access  content.  They have greater social connections that engender access to child pornography, though they take  no  real  steps  to  protect  whatever  content  they  collect.  The  secure  collector, however,  only  accesses  child  pornography  via  secured  or  private  networks  and deliberately categorizes and indexes their collections. They also exchange content with others  in  order  to  gain  access  to  secured  child  pornography-sharing  groups  and networks.  Although the previous categories involved no physical contact with child victims, the next  three  categories  all  involve  attempted  or  successful  direct  contact  offenses  in  the real  world.  These  categories  also  have  substantive  overlap  with  categories  from  the Durkin  1997  typology, as with groomers who seek sexual relationships with children online. A groomer may not access child pornography, but if they do they are more likely to  share  it  with  their  intended  target  to  normalize  the  notion  of  a  sexual  activity. Groomers are also dependent on the steps their victims take in order to minimize their risk of getting caught.  Physical  abusers  have  direct  physical  contact  with  children  and  are  similar  to groomers  in  that  they  may  or  may  not  access  child  pornography  and  may  have cultivated a relationship with their victim online. Producers go one step beyond abusers, as they document their abuse of a victim, or serve as a facilitator to document abuse in which  others  engage.  In  both  of  these  categories,  the  offenders  are  also  dependent  on their  victims  to  minimize  the  likelihood  of  detection.  Those  in  the  final  category, distributors,  are  responsible  for  sharing  the  content  used  by  offenders  in  any  of  the  317   previous categories. They may be either poorly or well connected to others based on the type of content they share, though they are much more careful to secure their activities from law enforcement. Distributors are also likely to not have direct contact with child victims, instead operating as a middleman to make content available.  An  expansion  of  the  Krone   2004   model  was  produced  by  Rogers  and  Seigfried- Spellar  2013  to provide specificity on the ways in which individual offenders may store content  or  misuse  their  devices  in  the  course  of  an  offense.  The  authors  retain  the original nine categories proposed by Krone  2004 , but provide additional context for the technical  knowledge  of  the  offender  based  on  the  file  types,  system  locations,  and software hardware resources an individual may use to either access content or conceal their  activities.  As  with  Krone,  this  typology  is  designed  to  aid  law  enforcement  in recognizing potential sources of forensic information to facilitate criminal investigations  see Box 8.7 for details .  For instance, browsers are likely to have evidence of their activities in their browser histories and recycle bin, while a private fantasy user may also have evidence located in external  hard  drives  and  their  phone  due  to  the  nature  of  the  content  they  create. Trawlers and non-secure collectors may have a greater range of software which they use to attempt to access child pornography and store files in unusual systems locations. The secure collector may, however, use file encryption in order to hide the file folders that store the content they acquire. The nature of the files and content used by the remaining categories are thought to vary based on their access to and use of child pornography as well as the nature of the abuse in which they engage.

In the USA, there are multiple federal laws designed to protect  youth  from  exploitation  and  punish  individuals  who  share  or  create  images  of child pornography. In fact, the first law criminalizing child pornography in the USA was enacted  in  1977,  called  the Protection  of  Children  Against  Sexual  Exploitation  Act. This  law  made  it  illegal  for  anyone  under  the  age  of  16  to  participate  in  the  visual production of sexually explicit materials, though this definition was extended to the age of 18 in 1986  Brenner, 2011 .  Later  legislation,  though,  has  had  the  greatest  impact  on  child  pornography  and exploitation through the implementation of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996. This Act extended the existing laws regarding child pornography by establishing a new definition for this term. Specifically, this Act amended the criminal code under Title 18 to define child pornography as “any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture of sexually explicit conduct”  Brenner, 2011: 51 . The law also recognizes that the image:  1  must have been produced involving an actual minor engaging in sexual acts;  2  involved or appeared to involve a minor, and or  3  was created, adapted, or modified to appear that a minor is engaging  in  sexual  acts.  This  definition  was  established  in  order  to  provide  needed flexibility  to  prosecute  child  pornography  cases  that  may  have  been  created  using Photoshop or other computer programs and sent electronically.  This  Act  also  made  it  illegal  to  engage  in  multiple  activities  associated  with  the production of child pornography. It is now illegal for anyone to persuade, entice, induce, or  transport  minors  in  order  to  engage  in  sexual  acts  for  the  purpose  of  producing images and or videos of the acts, and if they will be transported in foreign or interstate commerce  Brenner, 2011 . Similarly, it is illegal for anyone to entice a minor to engage in sexual acts outside of the USA in order to produce visual depictions of the behavior. It is also illegal for anyone to print or publish advertisements associated with the sexual exploitation of children  Brenner, 2011 . This law also makes it illegal to either conspire or attempt to commit any of these offenses.  The penalties for these offenses are rather harsh and include a federal prison sentence of  between  15  and  30  years  and or  a  fine.  If  the  offender  has  a  prior  charge  of  sexual exploitation on their record at either the state or federal level, they may receive between 25 and 50 years. If they have two or more charges, then they are eligible to receive a life sentence  in  prison   Brenner,  2011 .  In  the  event  that  a  child  dies  in  the  course  of  the offenses above, then the offender is eligible for the death penalty.  In addition to the production of child pornography, this Act also criminalized:  323   1.  the transportation of sexually explicit material featuring minors by any means,  whether physically or electronically;  2.  the receipt or distribution of such material; 3.  selling or possessing materials with the intent to sell them; 4.  possessing books, films, and other materials that contain such depictions; 5.  conspiring or attempting to engage in any of these activities.  Any  violation  of  the  first  three  activities,  or  conspiring  to  engage  in  these  acts,  is punishable  by  a  federal  prison  sentence  ranging  between  5  and  20  years  minimum and or a fine. If an individual has any prior convictions for sexual exploitation, they may be imprisoned for between 15 and 40 years minimum. The fourth offense may lead to a fine  and or  a  prison  sentence  of  no  more  than  10  years,  though  a  prior  conviction increases the sentence to between 10 and 20 years  Brenner, 2011 . Section 2252 of this same Act also made it illegal to knowingly:  1.  mail,  transport,  or  ship  child  pornography  by  any  means,  physically  or  electronically;  2.  receive or distribute child porn or materials containing child pornography; 3.  reproduce child porn for distribution through the mail or by computer; 4.  sell, or possess child porn with the intent to sell; 5.  possess  any  “book,  magazine,  periodical,  film,  videotape,  computer  disk,  or  other material that contains an image of child porn”  Brenner, 2011: 54 ;  6.  distribute,  offer,  or  send  a  visual  depiction  of  a  minor  engaging  in  sexually  explicit conduct to a minor.  The  first,  fourth,  and  sixth  activities  can  lead  an  individual  to  be  imprisoned  for between  5  and  20  years  minimum,  though  if  they  have  a  prior  conviction  for  child pornography they may receive a prison sentence of between 15 and 40 years. The fifth activity, possessing child porn, can lead an individual to be fined and imprisoned for up to  10  years,  though  if  they  have  a  prior  offense  history  they  may  be  imprisoned  for between 10 and 20 years  Brenner, 2011 .  These statutes all apply to images of real children who have been victimized in some way.  Some  have  argued  that  the  ability  to  create  images  of  virtual  children  using computer software or line drawings does not create the same issue of victimization. As a result, these materials should not be treated as illicit material because of the protections afforded by the First Amendment right to free speech in the USA  Brenner, 2011 . This challenge  was  struck  down  through  the  creation  of  the  Prosecutorial  Remedies  and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act  or PROTECT Act  of 2003. This law criminalized virtual child pornography and extended the legal definition to include “a digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image that is, or is indistinguishable from, that of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct”  Brenner, 2011: 57 . This Act remedied previous problems experienced by the prosecution when the defense  argued  that  the  individuals  in  the  images  were  not  actual  but  computer-  324   generated victims. In this respect, an offender could claim that their actions caused no harm  to  real  children.  Prosecutors  would  have  to  challenge  such  attempts  and demonstrate how harm may have occurred. The revisions afforded by the Act of 2003 shifted the burden of proof to the defense, so it is now their duty to prove that the child pornography images do not include actual victims.  In  addition,  this  Act  included  language  criminalizing  “obscene  child  pornography,” which involves any visual depiction, whether a sculpture, painting, cartoon, or drawing of  minors  engaging  in  sexually  explicit  conduct  or  obscene  acts;  or  involves  a  minor engaging in bestiality, sadism, or masochistic abuse, or sexual acts of any kind; and lacks serious literary, artistic, or scientific value  Brenner, 2011 . The language related to the value  of  the  image  is  critical  because  it  is  synonymous  with  that  of  the  Miller  test  of obscene material in the Supreme Court. As a result, this helps ensure that this standard is constitutional when applied to any criminal case.  In the USA, all states and the District of Columbia have criminalized the use, creation, possession,  and  distribution  of  child  pornography  and  the  sexual  solicitation  and exploitation of minors  Children’s Bureau, 2015 . These offenses are treated as felonies, though the range of sanctions varies in terms of years in prison based on the individual’s prior record and the severity of the offense. In addition, 12 states have established laws that  require  commercial  film  or  photography  processors  and  IT  workers  to  report  any child pornography they identify in the course of their work  Children’s Bureau, 2015 . These  laws  are  not  designed  to  require  computer  technicians  to  actively  seek  out  or search for child porn content but, rather, to ensure that such content is reported in the event  that  it  is  uncovered  in  the  course  of  normal  operations.  Reporting  any  child pornography identified provides the individual and their company with immunity from criminal or civil liability in most states  Children’s Bureau, 2015 . In the event that an individual  does  not  report  child  pornography  to  law  enforcement  at  the  state  and or federal level, the individual may be charged with a misdemeanor and or fined.  International laws regarding child pornography vary based in part on local standards for obscene content and their sanctions for use or possession of pornography  ICMEC, 2016 . In the UK, the Protection of Children Act 1978  PCA  was the first attempt to legislate against this activity, making it illegal to obtain, make, distribute, or possess an indecent  image  of  anyone  under  the  age  of  18   Crown  Prosecution  Service,  2017 .  The law  was  extended  in  1994  through  the  Criminal  Justice  and  Public  Order  Act  to include  images  that  appear  to  be  photos,  so  called  pseudo-photographs.  Additional legislation in 2009 called the Coroners and Justice Act extended the law to include all sexual  images  depicting  youth  under  the  age  of  18,  whether  real  or  created   Crown Prosecution Service, 2017 . The current punishment structures enable an individual to be imprisoned for between five and ten years, depending on the offense and the nature of the  content  the  individual  either  acquired  or  viewed.  For  instance,  possession  of  child pornography can lead to a minimum of two to five years in prison, though it can extend beyond that, depending on the nature of the pornography that the individual acquired  Crown Prosecution Service, 2017 . In addition, the Serious Crime Act 2015 criminalized  325   the  possession  of  “any  item  that  contains  advice  or  guidance  about  abusing  children sexually” which may be referred to as a pedophile manual  Crown Prosecution Service, 2017 . Having such materials carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison.  Canada uses a similar definition to that of the USA, though they also include audio recordings of the sexual exploitation of children and written depictions of persons under the age of 18 engaging in sexual activities or those who actively induce or encourage sex with minors  Akendiz, 2008 . In fact, Canadian courts can mandate that such content be deleted  from  the  Internet  if  the  materials  are  available  on  a  computer  system  within Canadian borders. Their sanctions for child pornography are also similar to the USA, in that the possession of child pornography is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, while the  production  and or  distribution  of  child  pornography  can  lead  to  a  14-year  prison sentence  Seidman, 2013 . Similarly, Australian law prohibits any sexual image, real or created,  of  children  under  the  age  of  18.  Their  sanctions  regarding  child  pornography offenses are consistent regardless of the offense, whether the production or possession of child  pornography,  and  include  a  fine  of  up  to  A$275,000  and  up  to  ten  years’ imprisonment   Krone,  2005 .  All  of  these  nations  also  have  laws  that  require  ISPs  to monitor and report the presence of child pornography on systems that they control. In the  event  that  such  materials  are  not  reported,  the  ISP  may  be  held  liable  for  the distribution of this content and eligible for fines and other sanctions  Brenner, 2011 .  In  2009,  India  criminalized  sexual  offenses  involving  a  person  under  the  age  of  18 through an amendment to the Information Technology Act of 2000. Under statute 67B, it is illegal for any person to:  a.  publish  or  transmit  or  cause  to  be  published  or  transmit  material  in  any electronic  form  which  depicts  children  engaged  in  sexually  explicit  act  or conduct or  b.  create  text  or  digital  images,  collect,  seek,  browse,  download,  advertise, promote,  exchange  or  distribute  material  in  any  electronic  form  depicting children in obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner or  c.  cultivate, entice or induce children to engage in an online relationship with one or more children for a sexually explicit act or in a manner that may offend a reasonable adult or  d.  facilitate abusing children online or e.  record  in  any  electronic  form  their  own  sexual  abuse  of  a  child  or  that  of  others.  This relatively comprehensive statute makes any of these offenses punishable by up to five  years  in  prison  and or  a  fine  of  1  million  rupees  for  the  first  conviction,  which increases to seven years in prison on the second conviction.  The Convention on Cybercrime  CoC  deals with child pornography under Article 9, requiring  Member  States  to  make  it  illegal  to  produce,  distribute,  offer,  procure,  or possess child pornography via computer or media storage device. The CoC encourages  326   the  use  of  a  definition  of  child  pornography  that  includes  visual  depictions  of  minors, people  who  appear  to  be  minors,  or  realistic  images  of  minors  engaged  in  sexual  acts  Brenner,  2011 .  Due  to  the  complexity  of  national  standards,  the  CoC  also  allows signatory nations to define minors as individuals under the age of 16 or 18, depending on their  current  standards,  and  may  choose  not  to  criminalize  created  images  or  those where participants only appear to be minors  Brenner, 2011 .  Since November 2004, the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children has published  eight  reports  comparing  legislation  on  child  pornography  across  the INTERPOL member countries. The first report in 2006 reviewed 184 INTERPOL member countries  and  the  most  recent  report   8th  edition   included  196  countries.  In  2006,  the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children reported that 95 countries had no  legislation  at  all  specifically  addressing  child  pornography;  this  number  has  since dropped  to  35  countries  in  2016   International  Center  for  Missing  and  Exploited Children,  2016 .  These  35  countries  with  no  legislation  addressing  child  pornography include Dominica, Ethiopia, Iraq, and Kuwait, to name a few. The report concludes that “there has been significant legislative change over the last 10 years [.] [but] the question remains  whether  countries  that  have  legislation  are  in  fact  enforcing  those  laws”  International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 2016: 17 .  Non-profit organization efforts  In the UK, the Internet Watch Foundation  IWF  is a charitable organization focused on  reducing  the  amount  of  child  pornography  and  exploitation  materials  hosted worldwide and criminally obscene adult content in the UK. The IWF receives financial support from ISPs, technology and financial service providers, and the European Union  Internet Watch Foundation, 2017 . Beginning in 1996, the IWF was created to provide a hotline  for  the  public  and  IT  professionals  to  report  criminal  content  found  on  the Internet. These reports are processed and used to distribute takedown notices to ISPs in the event that child pornography is identified. In fact, over 700,000 web pages have been examined since their inception, and the amount of child pornography hosted in the UK has decreased to only 0.2 percent as a result of their efforts  Internet Watch Foundation, 2016 . In addition, the IWF provides a block list to ISPs and industry so that individuals are  unable  to  access  content  hosted  online.  They  also  provide  assistance  to  UK  law enforcement agencies to pursue the distributors and consumers of harmful content.

The Center began in 1984 under mandate from the US Congress and then- President  Ronald  Reagan  as  a  clearinghouse  for  information  and  resources  regarding these crimes  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 2017 . Currently, the NCMEC is funded in part by the US Congress, as well as by donations from the private sector and matching donors. As a result, the NCMEC is authorized by Congress under 42 USC  5773  and  performs  multiple  roles  to  facilitate  the  investigation  of  crimes  against children  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 2017 . Resulting from the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008, the NCMEC operates a national toll-free hotline  1- 800-THE-LOST   to  collect  information  on  runaway  children,  and  the  CyberTipline, which  provides  an  electronic  resource  for  individuals  to  report  suspected  incidents  of child abuse, child pornography, and sexual exploitation. In fact, the Tipline has processed over 12.7 million reports since it was launched in 1998  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 2017 .  The NCMEC offers training programs for youth and educators involving the threats which  children  face  online.  The  NCMEC  also  offers  training  and  resources  for  law enforcement, including the Child Victim Identification Program  CVIP , which trawls through images of child pornography in order to determine the identity and location of child victims  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 2017 . This program received  more  than  4,600  requests  from  law  enforcement  agencies  across  the  globe  in 2014 alone, consisting of over 28 million images and video files  Krieg, 2015 . In addition, they support a joint operation with the US Marshals service to track sex offenders who violate the terms and conditions of their sentences.  The success of the NCMEC, and the recognition of a need for similar entities around the world, led to the formation of the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children   ICMEC   in  1999.  The  Center  is  also  a  non-profit  agency  with  a  similar  328   mission to the NCMEC, though it is focused on building partnerships in a global context to  better  investigate  child  exploitation  cases  and  build  the  legal  capacity  of  nations  so that  there  is  consistency  in  laws  to  prosecute  these  offenses   International  Center  for Missing  and  Exploited  Children,  2017a .  They  not  only  focus  on  child  abduction  and harm, but also have a substantive set of resources to support the investigation of child pornography and exploitation cases.  In  particular,  the  ICMEC  operates  the  Financial  Coalition  Against  Child Pornography   FCACP ,  which  comprises  35  financial  institutions  and  ISPs  which operate  jointly  to  handle  complaints  of  child  pornography  and  disrupt  the  businesses that  are  engaged  in  the  sale  of  or  profit  generation  from  this  content   International Center  for  Missing  and  Exploited  Children,  2017b .  They  also  offer  training  and assistance to law enforcement agencies internationally, along with legal consultations in order to develop model child exploitation law and harmonize legislation internationally. The ICMEC has national operational centers in Belarus, Belgium, Greece, Russia, and the USA,  and  has  new  regional  offices  in  Singapore,  Greece,  and  Latin  America  to  better service  the  nations  of  Southeast  Asia,  Southeastern  Europe,  and  Central  and  South America, respectively  International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 2017a .  Law enforcement efforts to combat child porn  At  the  federal  level  in  the  USA,  there  are  a  number  of  agencies  involved  in  the investigation of sexual offenses. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s  FBI  Violent Crimes Against Children  VCAC  program investigates a range of sexual offenses and criminal activities that affect youth, ranging from child pornography to sex trafficking to kidnapping  FBI, 2017 . This program became operational in October 2012 when two pre- existing  programs,  called  the  Innocent  Images  Initiative  under  the  Cyber  Division  and the Crimes Against Children  CAC  program within the Criminal Investigative Division, merged.  Each  of  these  groups  had  a  unique  function:  the  Innocent  Images  program investigated  child  exploitation  and  pornography  cases  online,  while  the  CAC  program handled cases of child prostitution, abduction, and sex tourism  FBI, 2017 . Combining these  programs  enabled  a  more  effective  approach  toward  the  investigation  of  these related  crimes  and  helped  reduce  the  burden  of  pursuing  the  tremendous  number  of investigations  of  child  exploitation  that  were  tasked  to  the  Cyber  division,  which  was already responsible for investigating hacking and fraud cases.  The  VCAC  program  now  falls  under  the  FBI’s  Criminal  Investigative  Division  and develops  investigative  leads,  which  are  pursued  by  field  agents  in  each  of  the  56  field offices  the  Bureau  operates  across  the  USA   FBI,  2017 .  In  each  office,  these  cases  are investigated  by  specialized  Child  Exploitation  Task  Forces   CETFs ,  which  are  joint operations  of  federal,  state,  and  local  law  enforcement  officers.  This  program  is  both reactive, in that it actively investigates leads and tips provided by the general public and reports  collected  by  the  NCMEC,  and  proactive,  based  on  undercover  investigations  329   initiated  by  agents  in  chatrooms,  social  networking  sites,  websites,  and  file-sharing communities  FBI, 2017 .  The  FBI  also  spearheads  the Violent Crimes Against Children International Task Force  VCACITF , which began in 2004 and is now the largest global task force in the world  that  investigates  child  exploitation  cases   FBI,  2017 .  This  program  investigates cases  of  child  sex  tourism  in  Southeast  Asia  and  Latin  America  in  order  to  develop practical evidence against US citizens who engage in such tourism so that they can be successfully prosecuted in the USA. Forty nations participate in this force, with 69 active investigators,  all  of  whom  share  information  in  order  to  investigate  child  exploitation cases  FBI, 2017   In addition, the FBI operates the Endangered Child Alert Program  ECAP ,  which seeks to identify the adults featured in some child exploitation content so that they may be brought to justice  FBI, 2017 . The faces and identifying characteristics of individuals are stripped from the media and published as Jane John Does in order to obtain arrest warrants  and  actionable  information  about  their  real  identities.  A  similar  program, dubbed  Operation  Rescue  Me,  has  been  in  operation  since  2008  and  is  designed  to identify the victims of child exploitation. Analysts sift through newly posted images and videos of child pornography in order to capture clues about the location and timeframe of when the media were made so that victim identities may be determined and saved. Thus  far,  the  program  has  led  to  41  youths  being  successfully  identified  from information available in these materials  FBI, 2017 .  The Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  agency also plays an important role  in  the  investigation  of  child  exploitation  cases   ICE,  2017a .  Their  role  is  often viewed in the context of managing the people and property that enter the USA, making the  importation  or  distribution  of  child  pornography  and  obscene  content  through  its borders, electronic or otherwise, an investigative priority for ICE agents. As a result, ICE manages  a  program  called  Operation  Predator,  which  is  designed  to  facilitate  the investigation  of  child  exploitation,  both  in  the  USA  and  abroad   ICE,  2017a .  This program  has  led  to  the  arrest  of  more  than  14,000  people  for  offenses  including  child porn production and distribution as well as sex trafficking of minors  ICE, 2017b . Not only do agents actively investigate these crimes, but they also work with state and local law enforcement agencies to provide intelligence and investigative resources to identify offenders  and  victims.  In  fact,  ICE  recently  developed  a  mobile  phone  app  which provides alerts and information about suspected and wanted child predators so that the public can report these individuals to law enforcement if they are spotted  ICE, 2017a . This  agency  is  also  the  US  representative  of  Interpol’s  working  group  on  child  sexual abuse online. Agents actively identify materials online and use these images and videos as the basis for investigative leads around the world  see Box 8.8; also ICE, 2017a .  Box 8.8 Immigration and Customs Enforcement  operations in action  330   29 arrested in international case involving live online webcam child abuse  www.ice.gov news releases 1401 140116london.htm.  An  organized  crime  group  that  facilitated  the  live  streaming  of  ondemand  child  sexual  abuse  in  the Philippines has been dismantled after a joint investigation by the U.K.’s National Crime Agency  NCA , the Australian Federal Police  AFP  and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE .  This article provides an overview of a recent case investigated by a joint operation including  agents  from  the  US  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement   ICE .  The case spanned multiple nations, with victims across the globe.  The  US  Postal  Inspection  Service  also  plays  a  role  in  the  investigation  of  child exploitation cases, since child pornography and obscene content was distributed directly via  postal  mail  prior  to  the  development  of  the  Internet.  The  Postal  Inspectors  have investigated these offenses for more than 100 years as the law enforcement arm of the US  Postal  Service   USPIS,  2017 .  There  are  approximately  1,280  criminal  investigators working within the office, as well as 611 armed uniformed officers  USPIS, 2017 . They often work hand in hand with other law enforcement agencies to investigate a range of offenses, including identity crimes and drug offenses. This is particularly true for child pornography cases, as the Service investigated 46 cases involving the use of postal mail to send or receive exploitative content, and made 46 arrests associated with these cases in 2016 alone  USPIS, 2017 .  For more information on the Postal Service’s investigative role, go online to: https:  postalinspectors.uspis.gov radDocs 2016%20AR%20FINAL_web.pdf.  There  are  myriad  specialized  policing  units  at  the  federal  or  national  level  to  331   investigate child pornography and exploitation cases around the world. The UK’s Child Exploitation  and  Online  Protection   CEOP   Command  is  a  part  of  the  National Crime Agency  NCA , which became operational in October 2013. The CEOP handles reports  of  exploitation,  abuse,  and  missing  youth,  and  will  directly  investigate  threats and coordinate responses, depending on the scope of harm across multiple areas  CEOP, 2017 . The CEOP also serves as the point of contact for multinational investigations in order  to  coordinate  responses  within  the  UK  while  working  in  concert  with  other agencies  around  the  world.  They  also  track  registered  sex  offenders  and  pursue  those who have failed to comply with any community notification requirements they may face as a result of their release from prison. Local police agencies can also request computer forensic assistance or covert investigation resources from the CEOP to facilitate a case against child predators. In addition to enforcement and investigative responsibilities, the CEOP also operates the ThinkUKnow program, designed to educate children and adults about threats to youth safety  CEOP, 2017 .  In Australia, the Federal Police has a special subgroup called the Child Protections Operations   CPO   Team  which  investigates  and  coordinates  the  response  to  child exploitation  cases  both  domestically  and  internationally   Australian  Federal  Police, 2017 .  The  Royal  Canadian  Mountain  Police   RCMP   serve  as  a  key  investigative mechanism  in  Canada  and  offer  training  and  investigative  support  for  local  agencies. They  also  serve  as  a  key  partner  in  the  Canadian  National  Child  Exploitation Coordination Centre  NCECC , the focal point of contact for online exploitation cases that cross jurisdictional boundaries within Canada or internationally  RCMP, 2017 . All of  these  agencies  also  receive  online  reports  and  tips  concerning  child  porn  and exploitation to serve as a basis for investigation.  In  the  USA,  Internet  Crimes  Against  Children   ICAC   task  forces  provide  a mechanism for coordination between local, state, and federal law enforcement, as well as prosecutors  ICAC, 2016 . The ICAC program currently comprises 61 task forces, with a presence  in  every  state.  Some  states  with  larger  populations  and  geography  have multiple ICACs, such as Florida, California, and Texas  ICAC, 2016 . The program began in 1998 under mandate from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention  OJJDP  in order to improve the resources available to combat youth victimization at all levels of law enforcement, including investigative resources, forensic and technological assistance, and prosecutorial guidance. In fact, there is now a regular schedule of digital forensic  and  investigative  training  for  ICAC  investigators  offered  across  the  country, which are supported by various federal agencies  ICAC, 2016 .  Although this may seem like a complex organizational hierarchy to understand, the response  to  child  pornography  and  exploitation  cases  requires  multiple  points  of coordination  and  response.  A  successful  investigation  requires  that  arrests  and takedowns occur as close together as possible to avoid offenders realizing that they may be  caught  and  attempting  to  flee  or  destroy  evidence  that  may  implicate  them  in criminal activity. Investigations that begin at the local level may also lead to evidence of criminal  activity  in  other  nations,  which  may  increase  the  scope  of  agencies  that  may  332   need  to  become  involved  in  order  for  arrests  and  prosecutions  to  be  both  legal  and successful.  This is evident in the recent series of arrests that took place around the world as part of  Operation  Spade   Ha,  2014 .  This  investigation  began  in  Canada  in  2010  and implicated a child pornographer operating out of Romania under the name Azov Films, which produced content generated by individuals living in the USA, UK, and Australia, among  other  nations   Ha,  2014 .  Agencies  within  each  country  investigated  domestic incidents, shared this information with their partner agencies abroad, and timed arrests and  takedowns  to  occur  in  such  a  way  as  to  have  the  widest  possible  impact  upon content generators and users. As a result, hundreds of people were arrested around the world in 2013 and 2014.  information   For  more  www.sott.net article 268763-Nearly-400-children-rescued-and-348-adults-arrested- in-Canadian-child-pornography-bust.  on  Operation   Spade,   online   go   to:  Given that child exploitation cases can be international in scope, there is the Virtual Global Taskforce  VGT   which  coordinates  responses  to  multinational  investigations. The VGT was established in 2003 and is an alliance of agencies and private industry that work  together  in  order  to  identify,  investigate,  and  respond  to  incidents  of  child exploitation   VGT,  2017 .  The  team  comprises  federal  law  enforcement  agencies  in Australia,  Canada,  Columbia,  the  Netherlands,  New  Zealand,  the  Philippines,  South Korea, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the USA, as well as Europol and  Interpol   VGT,  2017 .  The  VGT  takes  complaints  of  child  exploitation,  coordinates multinational  investigations,  and  provides  resources  for  children  and  adults  to  protect themselves  online.  They  have  been  tremendously  successful  in  investigating  child pornography  and  abuse  cases,  leading  to  over  1,000  investigations  and  hundreds  of arrests around the world, as in the recent Operation Globe case  see Box 8.9 for details .  333   Box 8.9 The Virtual Global Taskforce in action  http:  virtualglobaltaskforce.com 2016 vgt-announce-20-arrests-in-6-months-from- operation-globe .  VGT announce 20 arrests in 6 months from Operation Globe  The VGT released the results of “Operation Globe” [.] which resulted in the arrest of 20 offenders, and the identification of approximately 30 victims in 18 cases, some of which are still ongoing.  This  study  provides  an  overview  of  a  recent  case  investigated  and  pursued  by members of the Virtual Global Taskforce to combat child exploitation cases.  334   Summary  Taken as a whole, it is clear that any new technology or application will likely become a platform that individuals use in order to facilitate a sexual attraction to children. There is no  immediate  or  easy  solution  to  the  challenge  of  eliminating  child  sexual  abuse  and victimization. This is also one of the few crimes that can lead to substantive international investigations  and  cooperative  working  agreements  among  agencies.  Given  that technology changes so frequently and may be subverted by offenders in distinct ways, there will be a need for constant inquiry into the nature of sexual offenses in online and offline environments to improve and adapt the criminal code to new offenses. Likewise, law enforcement must understand offender behaviors so as to better collect evidence that can support the investigation and prosecution of sex offenders.

Since technology constantly evolves, what applications or devices do you think  may  be  misused  in  the  future  as  a  platform  for  individuals  to engage in the production or distribution of child pornography?  2.  In  what  ways  does  the  ability  to  communicate  about  sexual  interests  336   with children help make it possible for individuals to justify their actions and offend over time?  3.  Why do you think we sanction individuals who possess or access child pornography  with  more  severity  than  we  do  hackers  or  data  thieves? Why would there be such differential sanction use?  337   References  Akdeniz, Y.  2008 . Internet Child Pornography and the Law: National and International  Responses. New York: Routledge.

Discuss the extra-legal agencies that investigate these activities.  343   Online threats, bullying, and harassment  The development of email and other forms of CMC has completely changed the way in which  we  engage  socially  with  others.  Facebook,  Twitter,  Snap-Chat,  and  other  social media platforms make it easy for us to tell friends and the whole world what we are up to, when, and with whom, around the clock. Social living sites like Foursquare and even existing  platforms  like  Facebook  allow  users  to  check  into  a  location  so  that  everyone can know where to find them at any time of day. The ability to post videos and photos allows us to share virtually every facet of our lives with whoever is interested.  The  relatively  open  nature  in  which  people  can  now  lead  their  lives  is  unparalleled and  limited  only  by  an  individual’s  willingness  to  share.  While  it  may  seem  that technology  engenders  users  to  be  truthful  about  themselves  and  their  lives,  there  is increasing evidence that people are very willing to say and post whatever they can to either become popular or to connect with individuals they are interested to meet.  In fact, the creation and development of relationships through social media predicated on false information has gained prominent attention in the past few years. This act has been referred to as “catfishing” after the documentary movie and television show of the same  name   Peterson,  2013 .  Both  the  film  and  the  show  follow  individuals  as  they attempt to disentangle and identify who is actually behind the social networking profile with whom they have built an emotional, though non-physical, relationship  see Box 9.1 for an example of catfishing .  Box 9.1 Catfishing in the news  www.bostonglobe.com ideas 2013 01 27 catfish-how-manti-imaginaryromance-got- its-name inqu9zV8RQ7j19BRGQkH7H story.html.  Catfish: how Manti Te'o's imaginary romance got its name  “Catfish” is the name of a 2010 documentary about an online romance that turned out to be predicated on a  fictitious  identity.  The  makers  of  the  movie  developed  a  spinoff  reality  show  for  MTV,  also  called “Catfish,” devoted to the same theme of duplicity in virtual relationships.  This article provides an overview of catfishing and the ways in which individuals are affected by people who prey on their emotions and hide behind the anonymity afforded by technology.  344   While  catfishing  is  not  illegal,  individuals  can  be  emotionally  hurt  as  a  result  of discovering  a  relationship  that  they  developed  is  predicated  on  lies.  In  addition, catfishing is just one of many problematic behaviors that can emerge from the Internet and  CMCs.  When  relationships  dissolve  and  couples  break  up,  there  is  some  evidence that the individual who was dumped may turn to email, Facebook, or even YouTube in order  to  post  comments  about  his  or  her  ex  that  are  disparaging  or  hurtful.  The increasing ability that we have to take videos and images and send them to others has led  some  to  post  intimate  or  candid  materials  in  online  public  places  in  order  to embarrass or shame their ex.  At the same time, young people are increasingly using technology as a means to send bullying or harassing emails to classmates or people that they do not like. Such messages may  be  readily  ignored,  but  if  the  sender  is  persistent,  or  if  others  begin  to  “like”  or repost  the  messages,  it  may  lead  the  victim  to  feel  ashamed,  frightened,  or  sad.  A number of youth have tragically committed suicide over their experiences, though this is an  extreme  outcome.  The  most  notable  of  these  incidents  occurred  in  2006  with  the suicide  of  a  young  girl  named  Megan Meier.  She  befriended  who  she  thought  was  a young  boy  about  the  same  age  named  Josh  Evans  through  the  social  networking  site MySpace   Morphy,  2008 .  Their  conversations  became  frequent,  and  eventually  she became  emotionally  attached  to  him.  That  is,  until  he  began  to  send  her  mean  and hurtful messages and told her that the world would be a better place without her. Shortly thereafter,  Megan  hanged  herself  and  was  found  by  her  parents.  It  was  subsequently discovered that the boy she was talking with did not actually exist. The account was an early instance of catfishing; it was actually created by Lori Drew, the mother of one of Megan’s former friends. The two younger girls had a falling out, and Drew opened the account  to  embarrass  Megan.  Although  the  outcome  was  not  at  all  what  Drew  had intended  Morphy, 2008 , it did not change the fact that Megan died.  For  more  on  the  Megan  Meier  story,  go  online  to:  www.youtube.com watch? v=fGYVHFYop9E.  345   The Megan Meier case quickly became a lightning rod, drawing national attention to the  problem  of  cyberbullying.  Unfortunately,  multiple  instances  of  suicides  stemming from  cyberbullying  have  occurred  worldwide.  For  instance,  a  14-year-old  girl  named Hannah  Smith  in  Lancashire,  England  killed  herself  after  receiving  hundreds  of harassing comments on the website Last.FM  Fricker, 2013 . Similarly, a 16-year-old girl in Singapore was thought to have committed suicide as a result of a former boyfriend posting mean and hurtful comments on Facebook and via email  Chen, 2011 .  All  of  these  instances  demonstrate  that  the  use  of  technology  can  cause  real-world harm,  which  David  Wall  would  classify  as  cyber-violence   see  Chapter  1  for  further discussion .  What  we  know  about  these  issues,  however,  is  challenged  by  the overlapping  definitions  of  bullying,  harassment,  and  stalking,  as  well  as  our  limited knowledge  of  the  prevalence  of  victimization.  This  chapter  will  explore  these  issues, beginning  with  the  common  definitions  used  for  these  offenses,  estimates  of  both victimization and offending, and the impact they have upon victims in general. We will also discuss the inherent legal challenges that have developed and the existing statutes that may be used to prosecute these offenses. Finally, we will explore the agencies and groups involved in the investigation of these offenses. In turn, readers should be able to have  a  greatly  expanded  appreciation  for  the  overlap  of  these  events  and  the  general threats these forms of online harm can pose to all Internet users.  346   Defining cyberbullying  One  of  the  most  prominent  concerns  of  the  past  decade  is  the  issue  of  bullying, particularly cyberbullying, due to the increasing prominence of technology and its use among  young  people.  In  the  physical  world,  bullying  is  typically  defined  as  the intentional and repeated use of aggressive or negative behaviors based on an imbalance of  power  between  individuals,  most  typically  a  weaker  victim   Klomek  et  al.,  2008; Nansel et al., 2001; Olweus, 1993 . Bullying may take multiple forms, ranging from verbal threats or insults  like name-calling or teasing  to more serious physical harm  such as being hit or kicked . These behaviors may produce negative emotional reactions from the victim  due  to  embarrassment,  shame,  intimidation,  anger,  sadness,  or  frustration  Klomek et al., 2008; Nansel et al., 2001 .  Many  of  these  characteristics  are  evident  when  considering  bullying  in  virtual environments  as  well.  In  fact,  cyberbullying  may  be  defined  as  any  intentional, aggressive  behavior  performed  through  electronic  means   Hinduja  and  Patchin,  2008 . Although a bully cannot physically injure an individual through CMCs, they can cause emotional  harm  and  social  embarrassment  by  sending  threatening,  mean,  or  hurtful messages via instant messaging, email, posts on social media, and text messages via cell phones  Hinduja and Patchin, 2008 .  For more on cyberbullying, go online to:  1.  www.cyberbullying.us. 2.  www.bullying.co.uk cyberbullying   347   Similar  to  traditional  bullying,  cyberbullying  can  also  take  multiple  forms.  Willard  2007  proposed an eight-category typology of cyberbullying to characterize the activities of bullies and the experience of victims:  1.  Flaming: engaging in online fighting where users directly target one another  with angry or irritated messages, often featuring vulgar language.  2.  Denigration:  making  comments  about  individuals’  characters  or  behaviors that are designed to harm their reputation, friendships, or social positions, such as saying that someone is homosexual or making fun of that person.  3.  Impersonation:  falsely  posting  as  other  people  to  harm  their  reputation  or social  status  by  logging  into  their  existing  accounts  to  post  messages  or  by creating fake accounts to masquerade as that person.  4.  Outing:  posting  real  personal  information  about  individuals  to  embarrass them, such as sending images of them in states of undress, posting who they are attracted to, or information about homosexual preferences which may not be known to the general public.  5.  Trickery:  convincing  individuals  to  provide  personal  information  about themselves  in  what  they  think  is  a  personal  conversation,  which  is  then revealed to the general public.  6.  Exclusion: intentionally preventing others from joining an online group, such  as a network on Facebook or some other site online.  7.  Harassment: the repeated distribution of cruel or mean messages to a person  in order to embarrass or annoy them.  8.  Stalking:  the  use  of  repeated  and  intense  harassing  messages  that  involve  threats or cause the recipient to fear for their personal safety.  The typology proposed by Willard  2007  recognizes the substantive variation in harm that may occur online. In addition, it recognizes that bullying does not require repeated harm.  Posting  personal  information  online  that  was  shared  in  confidence  one  time  is cyberbullying.  Messages,  however,  may  also  be  sent  repeatedly  and  nearly instantaneously  to  a  prospective  victim  throughout  the  day   Jones,  Mitchell,  and Finkelhor,  2012 .  The  constant  exposure  to  hurtful  messages  can  cause  persistent  and pervasive emotional and psychological harm to a victim. In addition, a message may be posted  in  multiple  environments,  such  as  Facebook,  Twitter,  and  YouTube,  within  a short  space  of  time.  As  a  result,  multiple  individuals  may  engage  in  a  bullying experience  by  reposting  content  or  “liking”  what  someone  posts.  This  can  cause significant harm to a victim by making them feel as though the whole world is laughing at  them  and  they  cannot  escape  it.  Thus,  cyberbullying  may  be  just  as  harmful  to  the victim as real-world bullying – sometimes more.  As a final point of concern, bullying may also be viewed as harassment or stalking. Many  typically  associate  bullying,  online  or  offline,  with  juvenile  populations  where  348   power  differentials  are  common.  One  researcher  even  went  so  far  as  to  argue  that cyberbullying  can  only  occur  between  minors,  whereas  any  other  involvement  with adults should be viewed as harassment or stalking  Aftab, 2006 . Others have suggested that adults can be bullied, particularly in the workplace where there is greater potential for  individuals  to  intimidate  or  otherwise  affect  those  with  less  power   Kowalski, Limber,  and  Agatston,  2008 .  This  has  some  salience  in  school  environments,  where students  may  attempt  to  harass  their  teachers  online  or  make  fun  of  them  for  certain activities. However, the degree to which teachers are harassed or bullied by students has been  given  relatively  little  focus.  Most  researchers  focus  instead  only  on  the  issue  of bullying  in  juvenile  populations   Bossler,  Holt,  and  May,  2012;  Klomek  et  al.,  2008; Marcum, 2010; Nansel et al., 2001 . As a result, we will only discuss the issue of bullying in the case of juveniles and discuss potential age variations later in the chapter.  The prevalence of cyberbullying  Rates of cyberbullying vary substantially based on the group of youth sampled, the time the data were collected, and the way in which bullying was defined, or operationalized, by the authors. These issues make it quite difficult to accurately document the scope of cyberbullying within a single place over time, let alone cross-nationally. In general, the proportion of children who have experienced cyberbullying is somewhat lower than that of  traditional  bullying  in  the  real  world.  Several  nationally  representative  samples  of youth in the USA indicate that the rate of bullying is between 11  Nansel et al., 2001  and 30  percent  in  a  given  year   Haynie  et  al.,  2001 .  Rates  in  the  UK  demonstrate  that between  29   Department  for  Children,  Schools  and  Families,  2010   and  46  percent  of youth  experience  bullying  at  some  point  in  their  lives   Chamberlain,  George,  Golden, Walker,  and  Benton,  2010 .  Thus,  this  is  a  substantive  global  problem  for  youth generally.  Initial estimates of cyberbullying within the USA varied in the early 2000s, with rates of between 6 percent  Thorp, 2004  and 7 percent during a 12-month period  Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004 . Recent estimates from the USA suggest that rates of cyberbullying have increased,  which  may  be  a  reflection  of  greater  access  to  technology  at  early  ages. Kowalski and Limber  2007  found that 18 percent of a sample of middle school youth reported being cyberbullied over a 12-month period. Similarly, a recent study of 5,707 12- to  17-year-olds  by  Hinduja  and  Patchin   2016   found  that  33.8  percent  of  their  sample had  experienced  cyberbullying  at  some  point  in  their  lives.  Only  16.9  percent  of  this sample experienced cyberbullying victimization within 30 days of completing the survey, suggesting that victimization experiences may be distributed over time.  These rates, however, may be a result of distinctive student samples, as results from the  nationally  representative  National  Crime  Victimization  Survey-Supplemental Survey  NCVS-SS  on bullying and cyberbullying found that approximately 6 percent of students  aged  12  to  18  were  cyberbullied  during  the  2008 2009  academic  year   DeVoe,  349   Bauer, and Hill, 2011 . This figure remained relatively constant in sample data collected between  2012  and  2013,  with  6.8  percent  of  youth  reporting  being  cyberbullied   US Department of Education, 2015 .  For  more  http:  cyberbullying.org statistics.  information  and  statistics  on  cyberbullying,  go  online  to:  It is also important to note that there is some variation in cyberbullying victimization rates and those of youth engaging in cyberbullying behaviors. Ybarra and Mitchell  2004  found 18 percent of a sample of youth engaged in cyberbullying offending in a one-year period. A similar rate has been identified across multiple studies conducted by Hinduja and Patchin  2016 . In fact, their first sample of 370 youth found that 20.1 percent of their sample engaged in some form of online bullying. In one of their most recent studies from 2016  with  5,707  youth,  11.5  percent  of  children  engaged  in  cyberbullying  behavior  at some  point  in  their  lifetimes.  This  is  a  lower  rate  of  bullying  behaviors  compared  to other studies, and only 6 percent of youth had engaged in cyberbul-lying behaviors over the  past  30  days  when  the  survey  was  administered.  Thus,  there  are  some  differences evident in the rates of cyberbullying offending and victimization.  When examined internationally, the rates of cyberbullying victimization reported are also  substantial  and  similar  to  those  of  the  USA.  Recent  research  from  a  Canadian sample suggests that almost 25 percent of middle school students had been cyberbullied  Li, 2008 . Estimates from the UK suggest that rates of cyberbullying vary between 8 and 38 percent of youth, depending on the form of victimization, time of data collection, and the population studied  Department for Education, 2011; Tarapdar and Kellett, 2011 . A multinational study of youth in Greece, Iceland, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and Spain found that 21 percent of youth were victimized, with the highest rates observed in Romania  37%  compared to Spain  13%  and Iceland  13%   Tsitsika et al ., 2015 . A study of 276 Turkish youth aged 14 to 18 indicated that 23.9 percent experienced cyberbullying, 15.9  percent  engaged  in  cyberbullying,  and  21.4  percent  experienced  cyberbullying  as both victim and perpetrator  Erdur-Baker, 2010 .  Research on Asian populations is growing, and suggests that victimization rates may be  somewhat  higher  than  in  Western  countries  in  some  cases.  Evidence  from  a  recent multinational  study  conducted  by  Intel   2015   found  that  22  percent  of  youth  between the  ages  of  8  and  16  were  cyberbullied,  and  52  percent  engaged  in  cyberbullying  350   themselves.  Research  on  cyberbullying  in  a  Chinese  sample  suggests  that  the  lifetime victimization  rate  can  be  quite  high,  at  33  percent  of  a  middle  school  population   Li, 2008 . Data from a nationally representative sample of youth in Singapore suggests that while 67 percent of youth experience some form of physical bullying, only 18.9 percent experience cyberbullying, and 18 percent report some form of cyberbullying via a mobile device during a 12-month period  Holt, Chee, Ng, and Bossler, 2013 .  351   Predictors of bullying online and offline  Taken as a whole, these statistics suggest that cyberbullying is a problem that at least one out of every six youth may experience in his or her lifetime. It is not clear how this will change as smart phone adoption and social networking applications expand across the  world.  Despite  the  lack  of  clarity  on  this  issue,  there  are  specific  factors  that  may increase the risk of cyberbullying victimization for youth.  First,  females  may  be  more  likely  to  report  cyberbullying  victimization  than  males based  on  the  way  in  which  females  and  males  differ  in  their  expression  of  aggression and  harmful  behaviors.  Boys  generally  report  higher  levels  of  physical  bullying  and aggressive  behavior;  females  appear  to  use  more  indirect  tactics  focused  on  causing emotional harm through behaviors like spreading gossip  Boulton and Underwood, 1992; Klomek et al., 2008; Nabuzoka, 2003 . The evidence on sex differences for cyberbullying victimization,  however,  is  mixed  based  on  the  sample  population   Zych,  Ortega-Ruiz, and Del Rey, 2015 . Meta-analyses of cyberbullying research have found mixed results regarding  the  relationship  between  gender  and  bullying,  suggesting  that  there  may  be minimal  gender  differences  in  the  risk  of  cyberbullying  victimization  and  offending  Zych et al ., 2015 .  Second, there is also a link between age and cyberbullying victimization. While most research suggests that younger children are more likely to experience bullying in the real world   Borg,  1999;  Olweus,  1993 ,  cyberbullying  is  more  likely  to  be  reported  by  older youth  Sbarbaro and Smith, 2011; Tokunaga, 2010; Zych et al ., 2015 . The age variations noted may stem from differential access to technology, since the very young may have limited access to computer and mobile phone technology  Smith et al., 2008 . As children reach  their  early  teens  they  are  more  likely  to  gain  access  to  computers  and  phones, thereby increasing their exposure to bullying. This issue may, however, exacerbate over time with increasingly early exposure to mobile devices.  Third,  in  keeping  with  access  to  technology,  the  use  of  certain  technologies  may increase the risk of cyberbullying victimization. Spending time online in social networks, chatrooms, and on email can increase one’s risk of experiencing electronic bullying or harassment   Berson,  Berson,  and  Ferron,  2002;  Hinduja  and  Patchin,  2008;  Holt  and Bossler, 2009; Twyman, Saylor, Taylor, and Comeaux, 2010; Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004 . Ybarra  and  Mitchell   2004 ,  however,  also  found  that  increased  use  of  the  Internet generally may also increase the odds of online harassment victimization for females, but not for males.  Fourth,  the  methods  through  which  individuals  share  information  in  online environments  are  also  related  to  victimization  because  it  decreases  personal guardianship,  or  the  ability  to  protect  oneself  from  harm.  Individuals  who  provide sensitive  information  about  themselves  in  public  places,  like  a  social  network  profile,  352   have an increased risk of bullying victimization  Mitchell, Finkelhor, and Becker-Blease, 2007 . Posting school schedules, home addresses, or images and stories of themselves in compromising situations provides offenders with fodder for attack  Hinduja and Patchin, 2009 . The increased emphasis on photo and video-based social media applications like Instagram  and  Snapchat  also  creates  opportunities  for  individuals  to  target  someone based on their gender or appearance. As a consequence, individuals who do not manage personal or sensitive information carefully may increase their risk of victimization.  Fifth, being bullied in the real world is also unfortunately a strong predictor for being bullied  in  the  virtual  world  as  well.  The  relationship  between  bullying  across  both environments  appears  consistently,  regardless  of  where  the  sample  was  generated  Erdur-Baker, 2010; Hinduja and Patchin, 2008; Kowalski and Limber, 2007; Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004; Zych et al ., 2015 . This may be due to the fact that being bullied in the real world could immediately make someone a target for bullying in virtual spaces. In addition, the difficulty in escaping the bullying experience when it operates both online and  offline  may  have  a  greater  impact  upon  the  victim,  making  them  more  likely  to report negative psychological and emotional outcomes  Holt et al.,  2013;  Olweus,  1993; Tokunaga, 2010 .  To understand the predictors of bullying, we must also examine it from the offender’s point  of  view  in  order  to  provide  insight  into  which  youth  are  more  likely  to  bully others.  In  general,  these  youth  appear  to  have  a  temper  and  may  be  easily  frustrated  Camodeca and Goossens, 2005; Holt, Bossler, and May, 2012 . They are also more likely to report lower levels of self-control and display behaviors indicating that as well. For example, they report greater problem behaviors at school  Hinduja and Patchin, 2008 . At the  same  time,  they  also  have  low  compassion  and  empathy  toward  others,  making  it difficult  for  them  to  understand  how  their  actions  affect  other  people   Camodeca  and Goossens, 2005 .  Individuals who engage in cyberbullying also tend to engage in assaultive behaviors offline,  including  bullying  behaviors   Hinduja  and  Patchin,  2008 .  Cyberbullies  also appear to spend more time online and to engage in various online activities ranging from checking email to spending time in social networking sites, which is sensible given the mechanisms needed in order to bully others online  Hinduja and Patchin, 2008 . There are,  however,  few  demographic  correlates,  as  neither  gender  nor  age  appears  to  be clearly  related  to  cyberbullying  activities.  Studies  find  that  both  males  and  females engage  in  cyberbullying,  though  females  may  do  so  with  somewhat  greater  frequency  Zych et al ., 2015 . Similarly, studies have found mixed relationships between age and cyberbullying  Tokunaga, 2010; Zych et al  .,  2015 .  As  a  result,  it  is  important  that  we consider how the behavioral and attitudinal correlates of bullying may be used to better understand and intervene in bullying encounters to reduce the negative outcomes which children may experience.  The challenge of online harassment and stalking  353   As  identified  earlier,  some  categorize  harassment  and  stalking  under  the  definition  of cyberbullying.  These  definitional  issues  make  it  difficult  to  truly  differentiate  between harassment and stalking. In fact, Sinclair and Frieze  2000  argue that there is no way to identify  what  behaviors  should  be  classified  as  harassment  or  stalking,  and  thus  the terms  should  be  used  interchangeably.  There  are,  however,  a  few  salient  points  that could  be  made  in  order  to  identify  when  an  incident  may  be  defined  as  online harassment  or  as  cyberstalking.  While  both  behaviors  involve  the  constant  use  of email, text, or some other form of CMC, the effects which these messages have on the victim are pertinent. Instances of harassment may be viewed as bothersome, annoying, or  unwanted  by  the  recipient,  but  these  communications  do  not  necessarily  portray  a threat  Turmanis and Brown, 2006 . By contrast, cyberstalking may lead a victim to fear for their personal safety and or experience emotional distress  Bocij, 2004 . In both cases, the recipient should indicate to the sender that they want the messages to stop. Such an indication is important in order to help law enforcement pursue a criminal case against the sender.  It is also important to recognize that cyberstalking is related to, but not equivalent to, traditional  stalking  activities   Bocij,  2004;  Bocij  and  McFarlane,  2002 .  In  cases  of  real- world  stalking,  the  actor  may  track  his  or  her  victim  and  show  up  unannounced  and unwelcome in various places, which may intimidate or cause fear in the victim  Bocij, 2004 .  Cyberstalking  may  involve  a  variety  of  online  activities  that  produce  similar results, such as monitoring a person’s online behaviors, gathering personal information about  that  individual  through  various  outlets,  and  sending  hostile  or  threatening messages that imply they will cause bodily harm to the victim or to their property  see Box 9.2 for an example; also Bocij, 2004 .  Box 9.2 Vickie Newton and negative outcomes of  cyberstalking  www.fbi.gov news stories woman-sentenced-for-cyberstalking.  Woman sentenced for harassing victim on social media  The messages were relentless. A California woman couldn’t escape the barrage of malicious texts, phone calls,  and  social  media  posts  originating  from  a  mysterious  individual  with  whom  she  had  no  previous  354   connection.  This article provides insights into the experiences of an obsession-based stalker who went from being a criminal justice student in university to a convicted felon because of her fixation on a woman.  The  range  of  cyberstalking  does  not  simply  end  with  virtual  threats.  A  few cyberstalkers  have  sent  malicious  software,  like  keylogging  programs,  in  order  to monitor  all  aspects  of  their  victims’  behaviors   Bocij,  2004 .  Other  cyberstalkers  create false  posts  in  various  sites  impersonating  their  victims  in  order  to  embarrass  them  or cause them physical harm  Bocij, 2004 . For instance, a convicted cyberstalker in the USA named Shawn Sayer posted sexually explicit videos of his ex-fiancée to porn sites under her actual name, along with a Facebook account that reposted the videos  Hoey, 2012 . He  would  then  contact  individuals  who  liked  the  content  and  arranged  meetings  with the  men  at  her  home  in  order  to  have  sex.  The  various  men  who  showed  up  at  the victim’s home were then confused when she had no idea why they were there and made her fear that she would be raped or otherwise hurt.  A cyberstalker, however, does not have to engage in real-world stalking and vice versa  Bocij,  2004 .  The  anonymity  afforded  by  the  Internet,  coupled  with  the  volume  of information available about individuals via social network sites and other self-generated content,  allows  people  to  engage  in  stalking  behaviors  with  ease.  In  addition, cyberstalkers  need  not  know  their  victims,  which  is  in  contrast  to  real-world  stalking. Instead, a prospective stalker can identify any random target through Google searches or simple online interactions. The threats posed by cyberstalkers can be just as serious as those in the real world, and can produce the same response in victims as those found in traditional stalking activities offline  Bocij, 2004 .

Rates of harassment and stalking  355   In light of the challenges inherent in differentiating between harassment and stalking, it is important to attempt to identify the rates of these offenses in the general population. One  of  the  best  estimates  of  online  harassment  in  the  USA  comes  from  the  Youth Internet  Safety  Survey   YISS   sponsored  by  the  National  Center  for  Missing  and Exploited Children  Jones et al., 2012 . This study of youths aged 10 to 17 years who used the Internet regularly was administered in three waves: the first in 2000, the second in 2005,  and  the  third  in  2010.  There  was  an  increase  in  online  harassment  victimization across  the  three  time  periods.  First,  the  proportion  of  youth  who  reported  online harassment, as defined by receiving threats or offensive comments either sent to them or posted about them online for others to see, increased from 6 percent in 2000 to 9 percent in 2005 to 11 percent in 2010. Within these samples, the number of youths who reported distress,  as  measured  by  fear  or  being  upset  due  to  the  harassment,  increased  from  3 percent in 2000 and 2005 to 5 percent in 2010. In addition, the proportion of youths who experienced repeated harassment increased from 2 percent in 2000 to 4 percent in 2005 to 5 percent in 2010   Jones et al., 2012 .  The  YISS  also  captures  youth  engaging  in  harassment  against  other  children.  These figures  showed  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  youth  engaging  in  harassment  within each wave  Jones et al., 2012 . Specifically, those youths posting rude or nasty comments online increased from 14 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in 2005 to 40 percent in 2010. A similar increase was evident in youths who used online spaces to embarrass or harass someone out of anger or spite. This rate increased from 1 percent in 2000 to 9 percent in 2005 to 10 percent in 2010. These figures illustrate that the prevalence of harassment has increased for modern youth.  Similar  responses  are  noted  in  populations  of  college  students  using  assessments  of their  experiences  over  a  12-month  period,  though  it  again  depends  largely  on  the population  sampled.  In  a  study  of  New  Hampshire  college  students,  Finn   2004   found that  10  to  15  percent  of  students  reported  receiving  harassing  messages  via  email  or instant messaging, and more than half received unsolicited pornography. Similarly, Holt and Bossler  2009  found that 18.9 percent of a convenience sample of college students at a southeastern university received unwanted emails or instant messages. In addition, in a random  sample  of  students  from  a  single  university,  Marcum,  Ricketts,  and  Higgins  2010  found that harassment victimization ranged from 6.5 to 34.9 percent, depending on the type of harassment reported.  There  are  also  a  small  number  of  sources  available  to  understand  the  scope  of cyberstalking.  One  of  the  few  truly  nationally  representative  studies  assessing cyberstalking  in  the  USA  comes  from  the  National  Crime  Victimization  Survey- Supplemental Survey  NCVS-SS   Catalano, 2012 . Using a population sample of 65,270 people collected in 2008, the survey found that 26.1 percent of those who reported being stalked were sent emails that made them fearful. Similarly, Fisher, Cullen, and Turner  2000  developed a nationally representative sample of college students and found that 24.7 percent of those who were stalked received repeated emails that seemed obsessive or led  them  to  feel  fear.  Spitzburg  and  Hoobler   2002   found  some  degree  of  variation  in  356   responses based on the type of stalking reported, ranging from 1 to 31 percent for more common activities.  more   For  NCVS  www.bjs.gov content pub pdf svus_rev.pdf.  the   on   study,   go   online   to:  In  Canada,  statistics  suggest  that  7  percent  of  all  adults  receive  threatening  or aggressive emails and instant messages  Perrault, 2013 . The majority of these messages come  from  strangers   46  percent  of  male  victims;  34  percent  of  female  victims ,  or acquaintances  21 percent of male victims; 15 percent of female victims; Perrault, 2013 . A recent survey conducted by the National Centre for Cyberstalking Research  2011  in  the  UK  found  that  approximately  75  percent  of  a  sample  of  353  people  experienced some  form  of  online  harassment.  The  majority  of  messages  were  sent  via  social networking  sites   62.1  percent  males;  63.1  percent  females   or  through  personal  email accounts   55.8  percent  males;  56.4  percent  females .  There  are,  however,  no  current national  statistics  collected  within  the  UK  to  assess  arrest  rates  or  victim  reports  of cyberstalking victimization  National Centre for Cyberstalking Research, 2011 .  Understanding victims' experiences of cyber-violence  It is clear that many aggressive and hurtful comments can be sent through CMCs and that many people are victimized as a result. The responses that victims have to bullying, harassment, and stalking, however, are quite varied. A proportion of individuals are able to brush off their experience and move forward without taking the comments of their harasser or stalker to heart. However, some experience emotional or physical harm, and a very small proportion even go so far as to seriously contemplate suicide  Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004 . To better understand the victim response, we will examine each form of cyber-violence in turn.  Cyberbullying produces effects often mirroring reactions to physical bullying. Victims of cyberbullying often exhibit symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety  Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004 . Social withdrawal and school failure may also occur. These responses are more  likely  if  cyberbullying  incidents  occur  in  tandem  with  offline  bullying.  Young people  may  begin  to  skip  school,  or  be  truant,  in  order  to  try  to  avoid  persistent  or  357   repeated victimization  Katzer, Fetchenhauer, and Belschak, 2009; Ybarra et al., 2007 . In fact,  data  from  a  nationally  representative  survey  of  youth  suggests  that  4  percent  of children who were cyberbullied skipped school, relative to the 0.04 percent of those who skipped  school  but  were  not  victimized   Robers,  Zhang,  Truman,  and  Snyder,  2012 . Truancy may also occur because the victim feels that school is no longer a safe place to be,  particularly  when  they  experience  substantive  bullying  both  online  and  offline  Varjas, Henrich, and Meyers, 2009 .  Some  youth  may  also  skip  school  to  avoid  shame,  embarrassment,  and  stigma associated with their bullying experiences online or offline. In fact, Kowalski et al.  2008  argue  that  the  negative  impact  of  cyberbullying  can  even  be  worse  than  physical bullying experiences, due to the persistent nature of their victimization. A youth may be shoved,  hit,  or  called  names  in  the  hallways  at  school,  but  they  can  escape  that experience once they leave the campus. In contrast, cyberbullying is much more difficult to  avoid,  as  bullying  messages  can  be  sent  continuously  to  the  victim,  be  reposted  by others, and can also reappear, making the victim feel helpless  Campbell, 2005; Li, 2006 . One  of  the  most  noteworthy  examples  of  the  impact  of  cyberbullying  upon  youth depression  and  behavior  is  the  experience  of  Ghyslain  Raza,  also  known  as  the  “ Star Wars  Kid.  ”  The  15-year-old  Raza,  a  high  school  student  in  Trois-Rivieres,  Quebec, Canada,  made  a  video  of  himself  swinging  a  golf  ball  retriever   Wei,  2010 .  His movements  were  similar  to  the  style  of  Darth  Maul,  the  dual-lightsaber-wielding  Sith Lord from Star Wars: Episode 1. Raza had set up a camcorder to make a tape of himself for  a  school  project  in  the  fall  of  2002  and  filmed  himself  with  no  intention  of  others seeing  his  “lightsaber”  strikes.  However,  one  of  his  classmates  found  the  tape  in  April 2003 and showed it to a friend, who then converted the tape to a digital format. The two boys then distributed the video via email to friends, and it began to spread across the student body. One student even posted the video to a peer-to-peer file-sharing site with the title Jackass_starwars_funny.wmv, where it became a viral phenomenon.  The mental anguish young Raza experienced was quite severe because so many people saw  the  video  and  constantly  made  fun  of  him  for  his  activities.  He  became  severely depressed, dropped out of school, and was institutionalized for psychological treatment by the end of 2003  Wei, 2010 . Raza’s family sued the families of four of the boys who discovered the video and posted it online for damages and emotional harm, which led to an  out-of-court  settlement  for  an  undisclosed  amount.  The  video,  however,  has  been seen over 1 billion times on various online media outlets since it was first posted. Thus, the  global  spread  of  hurtful  content  can  have  a  substantial  impact  upon  a  victim’s emotional well-being.  In  addition  to  school  absences  and  emotional  harm,  some  victims  of  cyber-bullying report  having  suicidal  thoughts,  or  suicidal  ideation,  as  a  result  of  their  experiences  Hinduja  and  Patchin,  2008;  Klomek  et al.,  2008;  Li,  2006 .  Individuals  who  experience suicidal  ideation  often  have  negative  attitudes  generally,  which  may  be  a  long-term consequence  of  bullying  experiences  online  and  offline   Arseneault  et al.,  2006;  Beran and Li, 2007; Nansel et al., 2001 . Over the past few years, there has been a substantial  358   amount of media attention around cyberbullying and suicide. Much of this stems from the  seminal  Megan  Meier  case  discussed  earlier  and  the  multiple  incidents  of cyberbullying victimization leading to suicides around the world  see Box 9.3 for details on  the  Audrie  Pott  suicide  case .  Thus,  the  connection  between  virtual  and  real experiences must be considered further.  Box 9.3 The unfortunate suicides resulting from  bullying  http:  usnews.nbcnews.com _news 2013 04 14 17747411-california-case-another- three-part-tragedy-of-rape-cyber-bullying-and-suicide?lite.  California case another three-part tragedy of rape, cyberbullying and suicide  Three boys accused of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old California girl who took her own life after pictures of the attack were posted online are due in court this week, as authorities ramp up their investigation into the latest case involving rape and cyber bullying.  This article provides an overview of the harm that can result from cyber-bullying incidents, as evident in the case of a young girl who committed suicide after being assaulted and having pictures of the incident posted online and shared by others.  Victims  of  cyberstalking  and  online  harassment  may  report  similar  experiences  to those  of  bullying  because  of  the  persistent  messages  and  threats  they  receive.  In particular, victims typically report feeling powerless, shamed, and socially isolated from others   Ashcroft,  2001;  Blauuw  et  al.,  2002 .  Anxiety  and  depression  may  also  be  a common  outcome  due  to  concerns  about  actualizations  of  threats  or  the  worry  over receiving more messages.  Some  victims  of  bullying,  stalking,  and  harassment  may  begin  to  change  their behaviors  as  a  response  to  their  victimization,  deciding  to  either  take  steps  to  defend themselves or reduce their risk of further victimization. For instance, evidence from the NCVS  supplemental  study  on  bullying   Catalano,  2012   found  that  those  who  were cyberbullied were more likely to carry a knife, gun, or other defensive weapon to school.  359   A  comparative  analysis  by  Sheridan  and  Grant   2007   found  no  differences  in  the behavioral patterns of victims of either traditional or cyberstalking. Victims of traditional stalking  report  changing  their  behavior  patterns  in  order  to  reduce  the  risk  of victimization. Some also change their address, phone number, or email address in order to  help  reduce  their  ability  to  be  identified   Baum,  Catalano,  Rand,  and  Rose,  2009; Nobles, Reyns, Fox, and Fisher, 2012 . A small proportion of victims also begin to carry a defense  weapon,  like  pepper  spray   Wilcox,  Jordan,  and  Pritchard,  2007;  Nobles  et  al., 2012 .  Approximately  10  to  15  percent  of  victims  either  stop  spending  time  around friends  or  family  in  order  to  minimize  their  risk  of  exposure,  or  they  stay  with  loved ones in order to increase their feelings of personal safety and protection  Nobles et al., 2012 .  Victims  who  felt  higher  degrees  of  fear  were  more  likely  to  engage  in  a  higher number of these self-protective behaviors  Nobles et al., 2012 .  Reporting online bullying, harassment, and stalking  Although there are substantive psychological and behavioral consequences for victims of bullying,  harassment,  and  stalking,  it  appears  that  very  few  report  these  incidents  to agencies  or  individuals  who  can  help  them.  While  many  researchers  examine  the prevalence of cyberbullying or traditional bullying, few have considered how often these behaviors  are  reported.  One  of  the  only  studies  to  look  at  reporting  with  a  nationally representative sample suggests that approximately 75 percent of children harassed told someone  about  the  incident,  though  they  primarily  told  friends  rather  than  parents  Priebe,  Mitchell,  and  Finkelhor,  2013 .  Similarly,  the  NCVS  supplemental  survey  on bullying  Catalano, 2012  found that 31 percent of youths contacted a teacher or school official about their experience. Those who did not report the incident made this decision because they felt that it was either not serious enough or was so common that no one would take them seriously  Priebe et al., 2013 .  The  lack  of  reporting  to  parents  or  authority  figures  may  be  a  consequence  of concerns  among  youth  that  they  may  lose  access  to  the  technology  that  enables cyberbullying  Hinduja and Patchin, 2009; Marcum, 2010 . In fact, youth who experience cyberbullying  were  likely  to  have  had  a  conversation  with  their  parent s   about harassment and the risks associated with online communication, though it did not affect their likelihood of reporting the incident  Priebe et al., 2013 . A logical parental response may be to take away their child’s cell phone or perhaps limit the amount of time they can spend online. Such a response may be undesirable, especially for a teenager who has only  recently  acquired  a  cell  phone  or  is  used  to  having  unrestricted  access  to technology.  Instead, many youths who are cyberbullied tend to simply delete the messages they receive, ignore it where possible, or block the sender in order to reduce their exposure  Parris, Varjas, Meyers, and Cutts, 2012; Priebe et al., 2013 . In fact, most youth report the incident  only  if  they  feel  it  is  severe   Holt-feld  and  Grabe,  2012;  Slonje,  Smith,  and  360   Frisen, 2013 , such as if it lasts for several days or produces a severe emotional response  Priebe et al., 2013 . Limited research on the topic suggests that reporting cyberbullying experiences to parents decreases as youths age  McQuade, Colt, and Meyer, 2009; Slonje et al., 2013 . Instead, teens are more likely to report cyberbullying experiences to their peers  as  a  coping  strategy.  In  addition,  parents  do  not  appear  to  report  instances  of cyberbullying to police owing to perceptions that they will not be able to handle the case due to limited laws  Hinduja and Patchin, 2009; McQuade et al., 2009 . Similarly, there is some  evidence  that  school  administrators  may  not  want  to  contact  police  due  to concerns  over  how  the  incident  will  impact  the  school’s  reputation   McQuade  et  al., 2009 .  Similar issues are evident in the number of cyberstalking or harassment cases reported to law enforcement agencies. Statistics on victim reporting from the NCVS suggest that approximately 42 percent of female stalking victims and 14 percent of female harassment victims contacted police  Catalano, 2012 . The data reported for this study were amended recently due to errors in the way in which some acts of stalking and harassment were coded. As a result, it is not clear how many cases were actually made known to police  Catalano,  2012 .  Using  information  from  a  nationally  representative  sample  of  female college  students,  Fisher  and  her  colleagues   2000   found  that  less  than  4  percent  of women  sought  a  restraining  order  against  their  stalker  and  less  than  2  percent  filed criminal  charges.  Although  there  is  less  information  available  on  cyberstalking  and harassment victim reporting internationally, evidence from the Canadian Uniform Crime Reporting  UCR  Survey found that the majority  70%  of victims reporting intimidation or harassment online were female  Perreault, 2013 .  The lack of reporting for stalking and harassment cases may be due to a perception among victims that their case will not be taken seriously by law enforcement  Nobles et al., 2012 . Victims of crimes like sexual assault or domestic violence often feel that their experience  is  not  serious  enough  to  report  to  police  or  will  not  be  viewed  as  real  by officers.  In  much  the  same  way,  victims  of  stalking  and  harassment  cases,  online  or offline, may assume that officers will not be inclined to make a report or investigate. As a result, victims may feel abandoned by the criminal justice system and may proactively change behaviors that are perceived to put them at risk for further harassment. In fact, research suggests that victims who feel greater levels of fear because of the incident and perceive that they are being stalked are more likely to engage in multiple self-protective behaviors  Nobles et al., 2012 .  Regulating online bullying, harassment, and stalking  The prevalence of these various person-based online crimes requires substantive criminal laws  in  order  to  prosecute  individuals  who  choose  to  engage  in  these  behaviors.  The amount of legislative effort placed on these crimes, however, is mixed, depending on the offense.  For  instance,  there  are  no  federal  statutes  in  the  USA  concerning  bullying  or  361   cyberbullying. This is not a substantial issue given that most instances of cyberbullying involve people living in close physical proximity to one another.  Some advocates called for the development of new federal laws following the death of Megan Meier and the subsequent failure to successfully prosecute this case. Specifically, Lori Drew, one of the two women responsible for the creation of the false MySpace page and comments that led to Meier’s suicide, was charged in federal court for violations of the  Computer  Fraud  and  Abuse  Act   Steinhauer,  2008;  see  Box  9.4  for  details  on  the applicability  of  these  statutes .  She  was  charged  with  three  felony  counts  of  computer fraud and one conspiracy count under the assumption that she violated MySpace’s terms of service, which included the stipulation that users could not create fictitious accounts. The  jury  found  Drew  guilty  on  these  three  charges,  though  they  were  reduced  to misdemeanor counts, and the conspiracy charge was thrown out  Steinhauer, 2008 . The three  charges  of  computer  fraud,  however,  were  also  thrown  out  and  Drew  was  fully acquitted  in  July  2009  after  the  judge  argued  against  the  use  of  this  statute,  which  is normally reserved to prosecute computer hackers and data thieves  see Chapters 3 and 6 for details on the statutes; also Zetter, 2009 .  Box 9.4 The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act applied to  Megan Meier's death  www.ecommercetimes.com story 65424.html.  The Computer Fraud Act: bending a law to fit a notorious case  Officials were determined to punish Lori Drew for something – the suicide of young Megan Meier seemed a  direct  consequence  of  her  actions  [.]  Drew  ultimately  was  convicted  of  three  misdemeanors,  but prosecutors had to stretch a law beyond its original intent in order to win that outcome.  This article explains how Lori Drew was prosecuted under CFA statutes in the USA, and  why  the  case  was  fraught  with  difficulty.  The  case  demonstrates  why cybercrime  law  must  be  developed  with  flexibility  and  prospective  application  as technologies change.  In the wake of the failed prosecution and debate over the utility of existing legislation,  362   the Meier family began to pursue the creation of new laws to protect victims and seek justice against offenders at the federal level. This led to the development of US HR1966, called the Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act, which was proposed in 2009. This legislation would have made it illegal for anyone to use CMC “to coerce, intimidate, harass or cause substantial emotional distress to a person,” or use electronic resources to “support  severe,  repeated,  and  hostile  behavior”   Hinduja  and  Patchin,  2013:  17 .  The proposed legislation would have allowed for either fines or a two-year prison sentence. This resolution was not successfully passed into law  see Box 9.5 for details on the failure of this legislation .  Box 9.5 The failure of the Megan Meier bullying  legislation  www.wired.com threatlevel 2009 09 cyberbullyingbill .  Cyberbullying bill gets chilly reception  Proposed  legislation  demanding  up  to  two  years  in  prison  for  electronic  speech  meant  to  “coerce, intimidate, harass or cause substantial emotional distress to a person” was met with little enthusiasm by a House subcommittee on Wednesday.  This  article  provides  an  overview  of  the  failures  in  creating  legislation  to  outlaw cyberbullying at the federal level in the USA. The political and legal challenges that affect  the  adoption  of  legislation  are  both  interesting  and  divisive  and  are  further elaborated in this work.  Although  the  lack  of  federal  legislation  on  bullying  is  bothersome,  49  states   with Montana  as  the  sole  hold-out   and  the  District  of  Columbia  have  laws  in  place concerning bullying and require that schools have policies in place concerning bullying behaviors   Hinduja  and  Patchin,  2016 .  In  addition,  48  states  have  language  in  their legislation  recognizing  the  terms  cyberbullying  or  online  harassment   Hinduja  and Patchin,  2016 .  In  addition,  20  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia  provide  criminal sanctions  for  bullying  behaviors   Hinduja  and  Patchin,  2016 .  Virtually  all  states   45  require  schools  to  provide  some  sort  of  punishment  for  bullying  so  as  to  affect  the  363   behaviors of the bully and give some retribution for victims.  Fifteen  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia  also  include  language  indicating  that bullying may occur off-campus and can still be sanctioned  Hinduja and Patchin, 2016 . Some argue that it may be inappropriate to extend school jurisdictions beyond the school grounds,  as  parents  should  be  responsible  for  managing  youth  behavior.  Given  the impact  that  bullying  victimization  can  have  upon  students’  academic  performance, attendance, and mental health generally, some argue that it is necessary for schools to extend  protection  in  harmful communications while off-campus.  to  students  and  sanction  bullies  who  engage   The complexities inherent in legislating against bullying are also evident around the world. Singapore recently criminalized online harassment and bullying behaviors under the  Protection  From  Harassment  Act   2014 ,  which  includes  the   1   use  of  any threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behavior, or  2  making threats, abusive, or insulting  communication  that  may  be  seen,  heard,  or  perceived  by  another  person  to cause  harassment,  alarm  or  distress.  There  is,  however,  no  legislation  at  the  national level in Canada, Australia, or the UK. Legislation has been proposed in the past, as with Canadian Bill C-13 that would make it a crime to share an intimate image without the consent of the subject of the image, punishable by up to five years in prison. Although the bill failed, the province of Nova Scotia implemented its own laws to protect victims from offenders through protective orders, as well as civil suits for damages  see Box 9.6 for details on the incident which led to the creation of this law; also Serfas, 2013 . It was later struck down by the Supreme Court within the province due to its being considered overly broad. Similarly, there is no law designed specifically to deal with cyberbullying in the UK, the European Union, or Australia  Cybersmile, 2017 . These offenses may be prosecuted  under  other  existing  laws,  though  nations  may  choose  to  develop cyberbullying-specific legislation in the near future as public outcry increases.  Box 9.6 The suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons  www.theguardian.com society 2013 aug 09 rehtaeh-parsons-suicide-charged- photos.  Rehtaeh Parsons suicide: two charged over photos in cyberbullying cases  364   Police in Canada have charged two young men with distributing child pornography in the cyberbullying case of Rehtaeh Parsons, a 17-year old who killed herself after a photo of her allegedly being raped was shared online.  This  article  provides  an  overview  of  the  case  of  Rehtaeh  Parsons,  a  young  girl  in Nova  Scotia  who  was  allegedly  raped  by  two  men  and  a  photo  of  the  incident wound  up  online.  Rehtaeh  was  bullied  by  others  because  of  the  photo,  and eventually took her own life. The lack of laws made it difficult for her family to seek justice, leading to changes in Nova Scotia laws as elaborated in this work.  Harassment and stalking  Unlike  cyberbullying,  many  nations  have  statutes  that  may  be  applied  to  instances  of threatening  or  harassing  communications.  Under  Title  47  of  the  US  Criminal  Code, Section  223 A   defines  six  acts  involving  a  telecommunications  device  in  interstate  or foreign communications as illegal, including:  1.  Making,  creating,  soliciting,  or  initiating  the  transmission  of  requests  or proposals  that  are  obscene  or  involve  child  pornography  with  the  intent  to annoy, threaten, abuse, or harass.  2.  Doing these same activities knowing that the recipient is under the age of 18. 3.  Using a telecommunications device without disclosing your identity with the  intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass an individual at the called number.  4.  Causing another person’s phone to ring continuously to harass or annoy that  5.  Making repeated phone calls designed solely to harass that person. 6.  Knowingly  permitting  a  telecommunications  device  or  facility  to  be  used  for  person.  any of these activities.  While  some  of  these  behaviors  may  not  seem  criminal,  it  is  important  to  recognize that a stalker or harasser can easily automate the process of calling a phone number over and over again in order to annoy the recipient. As a result, the outcome of the contact is just  as  pertinent  as  the  behavior  itself.  In  addition,  the  phrase  “telecommunications device”  may  be  applied  to  a  cellular  phone  or  even  to  voiceover  IP   VOIP   telephony. Thus,  this  law  does  not  pertain  solely  to  landline  phones.  The  punishment  for  these activities includes fines and or imprisonment for up to two years.  In addition, Section 875 of Title 18 of the federal code makes it a crime to transmit any of  the  following  four  communications  via  interstate  or  foreign  commerce  methods, including postal mail, telephone, or the Internet:  1.  a demand for a ransom for the release of a kidnapped person 2.  a message with the intent to extort money  365   3.  a threat to injure a person 4.  a threat to damage property.  The  punishments  for  these  offenses  vary,  including  a  fine  and  two  years  in  prison  for threats  to  property  or  extortion,  as  well  as  up  to  20  years  in  prison  for  threats  of kidnapping and physical injury.  In addition, Code 18 Section 2261A of the federal law makes it illegal for any person to use an interactive computer service or any facility of interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in activities that cause a person to feel substantial emotional distress or place that person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to themselves or to their family  Brenner, 2011 . In addition, this statute makes it illegal to travel across state lines with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person and place them or their family in fear of death or serious bodily injury  Brenner, 2011 .  The  penalties  for  these  behaviors  involve  a  fine  and or  five  years  in  prison  if  the individual simply makes the threat. If serious bodily injury resulted from the offender using  a  weapon,  they  may  receive  up  to  ten  years  in  prison.  Should  a  victim  be permanently  disfigured  or  receive  a  life-threatening  injury,  then  the  offender  may receive up to 20 years in prison. Finally, should the victim die as a result of the offender’s actions  in  relation  to  threats  made,  they  may  receive  up  to  a  life  sentence  for  their actions  Brenner, 2011 .  It is important to note that these two statues require that a credible threat is made to either a person or property. The need for a so-called “true threat” stems from the case of United States v. Alkhabaz, involving a student at the University of Michigan named Abraham  Jacob  Alkhabaz,  or  Jake  Baker   Brenner,  2011 .  He  wrote  graphic  stories describing acts of rape, torture, and murder and posted them to a Usenet group starting in  October  1994.  In  one  of  these  stories,  he  described  performing  acts  of  rape  and eventually killing a woman who had the same name as one of his female classmates. His posts led the subject of the story to complain to the University of Michigan police, who investigated  and  brought  interstate  nature  of  online communications. Baker was arrested on six counts of communicating threats to kidnap or injure a person, though only one of those counts involved the woman who was the subject of the story. The case was dismissed by the judge due to a lack of evidence that Baker  would  actually  act  out  the  fantasies  described  in  his  writings.  The  government appealed the case to a higher court, but the decision was upheld, as the lack of evidence that Baker would act on the threat demonstrated the absence of a “true threat” to any individual  Brenner, 2011 . Thus, this case established the need for the communications to generate actual fear or concern for safety.  in  the  FBI  due  to  the   more   For  www.casebriefs.com blog law criminal-law criminal-law-keyed-to- dressler inchoate-offenses united-states-v-alkhabaz .  Alkhabaz   case,   the   on   go   online   to:  366   At the state level, virtually all states have legislation pertaining to either cyberstalking or harassment. There is some variation as to the type of laws in place, since some states have legislation against both offenses  Brenner, 2011 . With regard to individual forms of offending, 45 states have established laws that may be used to prosecute cyberstalking or harassment, which usually recognizes that the offender uses electronic communications to  stalk  or  engage  in  a  pattern  of  threatening  behaviors   WHOA,  2017b .  All  of  these statutes  incorporate  language  pertaining  to  a  credible  threat  of  harm  to  the  victim.  In addition,  40  states  have  harassment  statutes  which  do  not  necessarily  require  credible threats posed to victims or to their families  WHOA, 2017b . The statutes recognize the use of CMCs to annoy, harass, or torment the victim and are differentially located with state criminal codes. For instance, Arizona, Utah, and Virginia place online harassment under its own statute, while Delaware, Missouri, and New York incorporate these crimes under existing harassment and stalking legislation  Brenner, 2011 . The punishments for both cyberstalking and harassing communications range from misdemeanors to felonies, depending on the severity of the offense.  It  is  important  to  note  that  most  nations  do  not  technically  define  cyberstalking  in their  actual  legislation.  In  fact,  there  is  no  language  in  the  European  Convention  of Cybercrime pertaining to stalking or harassment  Brenner, 2011 . Instead, cyberstalking behaviors  are  subsumed  under  existing  legislation  regarding  stalking  generally. Australia, for instance, criminalized cyberstalking through the Stalking Amendment Act of  1999   Bocij,  2004 .  This  statute  recognizes  that  contacting  a  person  in  any  way, including phone, fax, email, or “through the use of any technology,” to cause the victim apprehension  or  fear  to  their  detriment  constitutes  unlawful  stalking.  Canadian  law allows  for  prosecutions  under  section  264  of  the  Criminal  Code  for  stalking  offenses involving repeated communications directly or indirectly with the victim or anyone they know, and or engaging in threatening conduct toward their victim or family members  Department of Justice Canada, 2012 . The punishment for such a violation is up to ten years in prison if convicted.

First is the Protection from  Harassment  Act  1997   c40 ,  which  criminalized  stalking  and  bullying  in professional  settings.  This  act  prohibits  conduct  that  constitutes  harassment  of  others, assuming that a reasonable person would believe the behavior to be harassing  Crown Prosecution  Service,  2013 .  Violations  of  this  statute  can  be  punishable  by  up  to  six months of incarceration and fines where considered appropriate by a judge.  Section 4 of the Act criminalizes the act of putting others in fear of violence, defined as any course of conduct that would cause “another to fear, on at least two occasions, that  violence  will  be  used  against  him  is  guilty  of  an  offence  if  he  knows  or  ought  to know  that  his  course  of  conduct  will  cause  the  other  so  to  fear  on  each  of  those occasions”  Crown Prosecution Service, 2013 . In addition, the offender must know that their  actions  will  cause  their  prospective  victim  to  fear  that  they  will  experience violence. Thus, the offender must know that they are actively affecting the behavior and demeanor of their victim. Anyone found guilty of such an act could receive up to five years in prison and receive fines based on judicial discretion.  This  Act  was  revised  through  the  introduction  of  the  Protection  of  Freedoms  Act 2012  to  include  language  related  specifically  to  stalking  and  to  incorporate  aspects  of technology  into  law   Crown  Prosecution  Service,  2013 .  Specifically,  it  added  new language  to  Section  2   regarding  stalking  to  harass   and  Section  4   about  stalking  to cause  fear .  In  Section  2,  stalking  is  defined  as  harassment  of  a  person  or  behaviors associated with stalking, including following a person, contacting them by any means, monitoring their victim through any form of electronic communications or the Internet, and  publishing  materials  or  statements  about  a  person  or  claiming  that  a  comment originates from another person  Crown Prosecution Service, 2013 . Anyone found guilty of such an offense may be imprisoned for no more than one year and or receive a fine. Section 4 now defines stalking where the victim feels fear as any act that leads the target to fear they will be violently victimized or cause that person fear or distress that affects their day-to-day behaviors on at least two occasions  Crown Prosecution Service, 2013 . Individuals found guilty of this activity may be imprisoned for up to five years and or receive a fine.  In  addition,  the  Malicious  Communications  Act  1988  enables  individuals  to  be prosecuted  for  sending  messages  to  another  person  for  the  purpose  of  causing  fear  or anxiety   Crown  Prosecution  Service,  2013 .  This  Act  was  revised  in  2001  to  include electronic  communications  of  any  kind  that  convey  a  threat,  indecent  or  offensive content, or information that is false. Any violation of this Act is punishable by no more  368   than six months’ imprisonment and a fine.  India  also  criminalized  stalking  and  cyberstalking  under  the  Criminal  Amendment Ordinance, 2013, under section 354D, recognizing any attempt to  1  follow,  2  contact, or   3   attempt  to  contact  a  person  despite  their  clear  indications  of  disinterest,  or   4  monitor a person’s Internet, email, or electronic communication, or  5  physically watch or  spy  on  a  person   Halder,  2013 .  These  actions  must  lead  a  person  to  feeling  fear  of violence, serious alarm or distress, or affects their mental state. Individuals found guilty of stalking may be fined, and may be imprisoned for one to three years  Halder, 2013 .  Enforcing cyber-violence laws and norms  As noted earlier in this chapter, cases of cyberbullying, harassment, and stalking are not necessarily  reported  to  law  enforcement  agencies  either  due  to  embarrassment  on  the part of victims or because the victim feels that the case may not be investigated or taken seriously by police. The lack of federal laws in the USA that may be used to pursue legal action  means  that  the  various  federal  agencies  discussed  throughout  this  book  are  not normally  involved  with  these  types  of  crime.  The  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation, however,  may  investigate  cases  of  threats  or  stalking,  but  only  if  a  case  involves  a substantive threat that crosses state lines.  Instead,  most  incidents  of  bullying,  stalking,  and  harassment  in  the  USA  and elsewhere are handled by local or state law enforcement agencies due to the potential for offenders and victims to live in close proximity to one another. In fact, a sample of 358 state and local law enforcement agencies indicated that 71.8 percent of them investigated harassment  cases   Holt,  Bossler,  and  Fitzgerald,  2010 .  Despite  the  preference  for  local agencies to investigate, there are no immediate statistics available for the reported rates of  cyberbullying,  harassment,  or  stalking  in  official  statistics  provided  by  law enforcement  agencies.  This  is  largely  the  result  of  the  fact  that  these  items  are  not currently  included  in  the  existing  reporting  resources  provided  in  the Uniform Crime Report  UCR .  Although  there  is  some  potential  information  available  concerning  the incidence  of  intimidation  involving  computers  in  the  National  Incident-Based Reporting System  NIBRS    Addington,  2013 ,  the  data  is  limited  due  to  the  fact  that only  31  states  currently  provide  information  to  the  NIBRS,  which  is  much  lower  than that of the UCR. As a result, it is unclear how frequently these offenses are reported to the police or cleared by arrest  Addington, 2013 .  Although local law enforcement can serve as a critical investigative resource for the investigation of certain offenses, some victims may not choose to contact police because they are not sure if what they are experiencing may even be legally defined as stalking or harassment. To that end, there are several not-for-profit groups that operate to assist victims online. In the UK and USA, the group Cybersmile is well known for its role in educating  and  assisting  victims  of  cyberbullying.  This  charitable  organization  was founded  in  2010  to  educate  the  public  on  the  harm  caused  by  cyberbullying  through  369   service  programs  in  schools  and  neighborhoods   Cybersmile,  2017 .  Cybersmile  offers educational  workshops  for  the  public  on  cyber-security  and  cyberbullying  that  are provided  by  community  outreach  workers  affiliated  with  the  group.  In  addition,  they offer  a  helpline  for  bullying  victims  to  help  connect  them  with  pertinent  community services  and  counseling  providers  in  their  area.  The  group  also  advertises  unique academic  research  publications  related  to  cyberbullying  victimization  in  order  to communicate  these  issues  to  the  public.  Finally,  Cybersmile  organizes  an  annual  Stop Cyberbullying  Day  designed  to  draw  attention  to  the  problem  through  community outreach events and fundraising to aid the organization  Cybersmile, 2017 .  For more information on organizations that aid victims, go online to:  1.  www.cybersmile.org , 2.  www.haltabuse.org .  For cyberstalking victims, the group Working to Halt Online Abuse  WHOA  is a key  resource  to  investigate  cyberstalking  and  advocate  on  behalf  of  victims.  This volunteer organization was created in 1997 in order to aid victims around the world who are  experiencing  harassment  or  stalking   WHOA,  2017a .  WHOA  handles  reports  of cyberstalking incidents from victims who contact the group directly.  The group claims to receive an estimated 50 to 75 cases per week, though the actual number of cases reported by the agency handled each year is smaller than this due to the amount of information victims provide  WHOA, 2017a . This affects the number of cases they report to the general public on a yearly basis. WHOA reported 220 cases in 2009, 349 in 2010, 305 in 2011, 394 in 2012, and 256 in 2013  WHOA, 2017a . This does not mean that there has been a substantive change in the incidence of cyberstalking. It may just  370   reflect a larger number of respondents completely filling out the online reporting form from 2011 to 2013 respectively. Complaints made by prospective victims are then passed on to their staff of Internet Safety Advocates who work directly with victims in order to determine the source of harassing or stalking messages and contact web hosting services, ISPs, and law enforcement. It is important to note that advocates cannot force any entity to remove content that may be harmful to a victim, but they may write and request that material be removed. WHOA is also not a law enforcement agency; thus, they cannot pursue  an  offender  or  bring  charges  against  any  entity  involved  in  the  hosting  or facilitation  of  harassment   WHOA,  2017a .  The  group’s  practical  experience  with stalking  behaviors  and  technology,  however,  makes  them  well  prepared  to  assist individuals who may experience cyberstalking.  As a result of the problems that law enforcement and non-profit organizations have in helping individuals after they have been victimized, researchers, advocacy groups, and even  schools  emphasize  the  need  for  individuals  to  take  control  of  managing  their personal safety as a key tool in reducing their risk of bullying, stalking, and harassment. This  may  be  due  to  the  overwhelming  role  of  individual  choice  in  online  spaces.  For instance, no one is required to have an account on a social networking site like Facebook or Twitter. Certainly, people are able to stay in touch with their friends and keep abreast of  current  events  through  these  sites,  but  it  is  not  a  necessity.  If  they  establish  an account, they decide how much information to post about themselves and in what way they  accept  or  maintain  friends.  Should  that  person  feel  dissatisfied  with  a  post  or  an exchange with another person, they have the power to delete those messages. In fact, one of the top “tools” Facebook provides for users to maintain their security is the ability to unfriend someone, block individuals, and use the “Report” button on the page in order to bring  that  content  to  the  attention  of  Facebook  security.  It  is  not  clear  how  many reported incidents are investigated. Facebook notes  Facebook Tools, 2012 :  People you report won’t know that they’ve been reported. After you submit a report, we’ll investigate the issue and determine whether or not the content should be removed based on the Facebook Terms. We research each report to decide the appropriate course of action.  Since  various  tools  are  readily  available,  it  makes  sense  to  argue  that  personal responsibility and accountability for safety should be encouraged. The challenge lies  in clearly  communicating  these  issues  to  young  people  and  those  with  fewer  computer skills and less online experience. An excellent example of security in action may be seen in the creation and use of email accounts. Various services provide free email accounts, such as Hotmail, Yahoo, and Gmail. When a person sets up their account, it is important to avoid using either their real name or a gendered term in the address. It may be easier to  determine  a  person’s  identity  if  their  email  address  or  social  media  name  is Janelovesmovies4419  than  if  it  were  something  more  neutral,  like  moviefan.  Similarly, the use of sexual or explicit language in your email address or social networking profile may also increase the potential to receive unsolicited emails.  In  order  to  curb  instances  of  bullying  and  harassment  among  youth,  many  security  371   experts recommend that parents place computers in public spaces within their home, like the kitchen or living room, and require children to have some parental supervision while online.  The  ability  to  quickly  observe  the  kinds  of  websites  which  children  visit  and periodically monitor their online activities could help reduce the number of questionable websites  to  which  they  are  exposed.  However,  cheap  access  to  lightweight  portable Internet-enabled  devices,  like  iPods,  iPads,  Kindles,  and  laptops,  makes  it  difficult  to ensure that children are using devices in close proximity to parents. Some also argue that parents should install filtering software to manage the kinds of websites their children can  visit.  These  devices  can,  however,  be  difficult  for  parents  with  little  technological skill to set up or properly configure to ensure maximum effectiveness. Recent research suggests that children are able to easily circumvent these protective software programs or  use  other  wireless  Internet  access  points  in  order  to  avoid  these  devices  altogether  Bossler et al.,  2012;  Jones  et al.,  2012 .  Even  if  a  parent  is  able  to  properly  configure software  at  home,  it  does  not  matter  once  their  child  goes  to  school  or  to  a  friend’s house, where they have less control over their children’s Internet activities and access.  Because of the inherent difficulty in managing the online experiences of young people, one of the most important steps that parents and schools can take is to begin a frank and honest  conversation  about  Internet  use   see  Box  9.7  for  Facebook’s  suggestions  for parents . Understanding how and why young people are using technology is vital to keep pace  with  their  changing  online  habits.  Furthermore,  it  is  important  to  recognize  that adults  can  and  should  play  a  role  in  the  socialization  of  youth  into  acceptable  online behaviors. Parents and guardians teach children what is right and wrong in the physical world,  and  that  same  experience  must  play  out  in  online  spaces.  Admittedly,  young people are exposed to millions of people around the world through the Internet, and not all  of  those  people  will  be  on  their  best  behavior  at  all  times.  Thus,  it  is  critical  that someone is able to explain and give context to why certain activities may happen but should not be performed by their child. For instance, just because friends post their class schedule or where they will be at a specific time of day on Facebook does not mean that they have to do it as well.  Box 9.7 Facebook security suggestions for parents  www.facebook.com safety groups parents .  372   Help your teens play it safe  For years, teenagers spent much of their free time talking to friends on the phone. Today’s teens aren’t so different. They just have more ways to communicate[.] If you have a Facebook timeline, and have friended your child, try to respect the same boundaries you use offline.  This article provides Facebook’s suggestions on how parents and teens should work together to be safe while online. Many of these ideas are not novel, but require a clear line of communication between adults and children and an ability to respect one another’s privacy and responsibilities.  373   Summary  In  reviewing  our  knowledge  of  bullying,  harassment,  and  stalking,  it  is  clear  that  this problem  will  not  go  away.  Technology  has  made  it  incredibly  easy  for  individuals  to send hurtful or threatening communications online, and the perception that victims may not be able to report their experiences means that incidents may go unacknowledged. As a  result,  it  is  hard  to  combat  this  problem  because  of  confusion  over  who  has  the appropriate jurisdiction to investigate the offense and whether or not it is a crime based on existing statutes. The increasing public attention drawn to the serious consequences of  cyber-bullying  and  stalking  cases,  however,  may  force  a  change  in  the  policy  and social  response  over  future  years.  The  attempts  to  develop  national  laws  around cyberbullying are an excellent demonstration of the ways in which society is attempting to respond to these acts. Thus, the way in which we deal with bullying and stalking will no doubt change over the next ten years as perceptions of these behaviors change.

Should we define youth who make harassing or disparaging comments about their teachers in online spaces as engaging in cyberbullying, or is it harassment? Simply put, why should we define an act differently on the basis of the ages of the victim and offender?  2.  How do we communicate what is acceptable online behavior to youth in a  way  that  is  accepted  and  clear?  Furthermore,  how  do  we  limit  the effects  of  “peer  pressure”  on  technology  use  and  acceptance,  where friends post sensitive information about themselves or personal pictures that could be abused by others?  3.  How easy is it to find the reporting tools and links for harassing language on the social networking sites you use most often? Look on the sites and see  how  long  it  takes  you  to  find  it  on  YouTube,  Instagram,  Snapchat, and Twitter. Are they easy to find? Are they in obvious places?  4.  Should schools be able to punish students for online activities that take place outside of the campus and after or before school hours if it directly affects the behavior of other students?

For  instance,  members  of  various  Irish  Republican  Army  IRA   groups  engaged  in  terror  attacks  against  English  targets  from  the  mid-1970s through  the  early  2000s.  Similarly,  domestic  extremist  groups  within  the  USA  have engaged in a number of attacks over the past few decades, such as Timothy McVeigh’s 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  Schmid and Jongman, 2005 .  The  terror  attacks  of  September  11,  2001  in  the  USA,  however,  demonstrated  the substantial  threat  posed  by  international  terror  groups  who  may  operate  in  nations around the globe, though their agendas and interests may not be directly caused by their target   Schmid  and  Jongman,  2005 .  Major  terror  incidents  have  occurred  worldwide, including  attacks  against  commuter  trains  in  Madrid,  Spain  in  2004,  various  targets  in Mumbai, India in 2008, as well as more recent attacks such as the Bataclan Theater in Paris, France in 2015 and the Ataturk Airport attack in Istanbul, Turkey in 2016.  Although these incidents were perpetrated by radical Islamist extremist groups such as  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria   ISIS ,  various  entities  have  attempted  or succeeded  in  committing  attacks  of  all  sorts.  For  instance,  various  domestic  extremist and  radical  groups  in  the  USA  are  responsible  for  more  combined  deaths  than  that  of Islamic  radicals  generally   Caspi,  Freilich,  and  Chermak,  2012 .  As  a  consequence, physical  security  measures  have  been  implemented  in  order  to  increase  the  successful identification  and  disruption  of  further  attacks.  The  USA  have  radically  changed  their airport  screening  procedures  to  identify  dangerous  materials  prior  to  entering  flight terminals. In addition, many governments have recalibrated their law enforcement and intelligence-gathering  agencies  to  focus  on  the  prevention  of  terror  and  increased collaborative information-sharing programs.  Although  the  focus  on  real-world  attacks  is  an  obvious  necessity  due  to  the tremendous  potential  for  civilian  casualties  and  property  damage,  there  has  been  less attention paid to the prospective threat of attacks through cyberspace. This is surprising, since virtually all industrialized nations are dependent on technology in order to engage in commerce and manage utilities, like water and power, as well as communications. A carefully targeted attack against any critical infrastructure resource could cause serious harm to the security of the network and potentially cause harm in the real world. Such a scenario has become increasingly popular in media and films, as in the movies Live Free or  Die  Hard  and  Skyfall,  where  groups  of  cyberterrorists  compromise  traffic  control systems,  government  computers,  utilities,  and  financial  systems  through  a  series  of coordinated hacks.  The sensationalized appearance of cyber-attacks in film has led to significant debate  383   over the realities of virtual attacks against critical infrastructure. In the mid-1990s, when the  World  Wide  Web  and  computer  technologies  were  being  rapidly  adopted  by industrialized nations, individuals in government and computer security theorized that such attacks were possible  Drogin, 1999; Verton, 2003 . For instance, Deputy Secretary of Defense  John  Hamre  and  Richard  Clark,  an  advisor  on  cyber-security,  used  the  term electronic Pearl Harbor to refer to a cyber-attack against the USA that would take the nation  by  surprise  and  cause  crippling  harm   Verton,  2003 .  The  lack  of  concrete evidence that such attacks were happening led some to dismiss these claims.  Their  predictions,  however,  were  surprisingly  accurate,  given  the  scope  of  attacks occurring  around  the  world  on  a  regular  basis.  There  are  now  numerous  examples  of hackers gaining access to sensitive electrical grid networks and sewage control systems around  the  world.  Perhaps  most  concerning  is  the  emergence  of  military  entities engaging in systematic attacks against corporations and government networks. In fact, the security firm Mandiant  2013  recently published a report linking multiple years of attacks  to  a  single  unit  of  the  People’s  Liberation  Army  of  China   PLA   that  was previously unidentified. This group, designated Unit 61398 in the Third Department of the  General  Staff  Department  of  the  PLA,  is  thought  to  be  staffed  by  dozens  if  not hundreds  of  workers  with  specialized  knowledge  of  computer  security  and  network attacks. The unit has actively compromised various targets for years, including attempts to gain access to companies managing electrical grids and pipelines for oil and gas. In addition, the attackers were able to stay inside of targeted systems for up to a year at a time  and  maintain  backdoor  access  to  systems.  As  a  result,  Mandiant  refers  to  their attacks as Advanced Persistent Threat  APT  1 due to their persistence and effectiveness. Such high-level attacks with direct connections to the military suggest that we may be in the  middle  of  a  new  “cold  war”  that  is  otherwise  unknown  to  the  citizens  of  these nations.  more   For  http:  intelreport.mandiant.com Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf.  report,   APTI   the   on   go   online   to:  These  issues  raise  complex  questions  about  the  very  nature  of  how  these  threats should be viewed and who has the responsibility to respond. For instance, when does an event move from being viewed as a crime to that of an act of war? Should cyberterror be defined or viewed differently from traditional acts of terror? This chapter will attempt to  384   address  these  questions  in  a  systematic  fashion.  First,  we  will  define  crime,  terror, cyberterror,  and  war.  In  addition,  the  ways  in  which  extremist  groups  and  terror organizations use the Internet in order to support their activities or engage in attacks will be explored in detail. Finally, the legislative efforts in place to deal with terrorism as well as coordinate the response to cyberwar will be discussed in depth.

Both  criminals  and  ideologically  driven  extremist  or  terror groups may use the same skills or behaviors in the course of an activity. Many nations charge terrorists under criminal statutes  Brenner, 2008 . One way that we may be able to discern the differences between these behaviors is to consider both the motive of the actor  and  the  number  of  people  harmed.  Criminals  often  target  single  individuals  in order  to  increase  their  likelihood  of  success  and  are  often  driven  by  economic  or emotional desires. For instance, an individual may assault another individual in order to get  money  in  the  course  of  a  robbery  or  kill  a  person  in  retribution  or  cold  blood.  A terrorist or extremist group, however, tends to target large groups of people or physical locations  that  can  cause  massive  collateral  damage  while  at  the  same  time  drawing attention to a specific ideological, political, or religious agenda. In addition, many acts of terror  are  designed  to  target  innocent  people  in  order  to  cause  general  panic  and  fear among the larger populace, rather than simple economic gain  Brenner, 2008 .  Recognizing the role of motivation is necessary to identify an act of terror. There are, however, a wide range of activities which people engage in that express their political or ideological beliefs. Thus, it is necessary to situate acts of terror within the spectrum of political  behaviors  online  and  offline,  ranging  from  non-violent  expression  to  serious physical violence  Holt and Kilger, 2012; Schmid, 1988, 2004 . There are myriad forms of non-violent  resistance  in  which  individuals  engage  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  Prior  to  the emergence of the World Wide Web, individuals could express their dissent with political positions  through  letter-writing  campaigns  to  print  media  outlets  as  well  as  their legislative  representatives.  Freedom  of  speech  throughout  the  industrialized  world  also enables  individuals  to  express  their  opinions  in  public  settings,  regardless  of  how negative  they  may  be.  The  Web  has  extended  this  capability,  as  individuals  regularly post messages about their views on politics and social issues on Face-book, Twitter, and other  social  media   Martin,  2006;  Schmid,  1988,  2004 .  In  fact,  individuals  now  contact politicians and representatives through the Internet at the same rate as postal mail and telephone  Best and Krueger, 2005 .  The development of social media has had a substantive impact upon the acceptance and  growth  of  social  movements  across  the  globe.  Individuals  posting  messages  on Facebook, YouTube, or web forums can have their message viewed by others who share their point of view, or who may come to support their cause through convincing stories  Ayers, 1999; Chadwick, 2007; Jennings and Zeitner, 2003; Stepanova, 2011 . The use of social  media  to  develop  networks  of  social  support  is  crucial  in  the  formation  of  a collective identity that can move into real spaces in order to affect social change. This was  demonstrated  during  the  Arab  Spring  protests  across  the  Middle  East  in  2009,  as  386   participants  planned  and  promoted  their  activities  via  social  media   see  Box  10.1  for details . Similar steps were taken by protesters in the USA opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline,  a  major  oil  pipeline  that  would  be  built  near  Native  American  tribal  lands  Dreyfuss, 2017 . In fact, social media allow for the formation of so-called flash mobs, where  individuals  coordinate  organized  activities,  like  dances  or  organized  marches, through Facebook or Twitter which take others by surprise. In turn, videos and messages posted online about the events are able to generate additional attention to their causes. Thus, organized forms of non-violent expression can be enabled by virtual experiences and communication  Chadwick, 2007; Earl and Schussman, 2003; Jennings and Zeitner, 2003; Stepanova, 2011; Van Laer, 2010 .  Box 10.1 The use of technology in protest activities  www.huffingtonpost.com andrew-lam social-media-middle-east-protests- _b_1881827.html?.  From Arab Spring to autumn rage: the dark power of social media  Mohamed Bouazizi [.] set himself on ablaze protesting police corruption, became literally the torch that lit the Arab Spring revolution that spread quickly throughout the Middle East. Bouazzi achieved this in his very public death because many who had cell phones recorded his protest and the subsequent videos kick- started the uprising.  This article describes the Arab Spring uprising and how social media and cell phone technology  engendered  these  events.  The  content  provides  a  valuable  example  of how everyday technologies can be used to subvert the status quo in government and society as a whole.  Political  expression  in  the  real  world  can  also  include  the  use  of  destruction  or vandalism  in  order  to  express  dissent   Brenner,  2008;  Denning,  2010;  Holt  and  Kilger, 2012 . For instance, individuals may deface images of politicians or burn flags in order to express  their  dissent  over  a  nation’s  position  toward  an  event.  In  virtual  spaces, individuals  may  engage  in  similar  forms  of  vandalism  against  websites  or  specific resources in order to express their disagreement with a policy or practice  Denning, 2010;  387   Woo, Kim, and Dominick, 2004 . One such example is an individual claiming to belong to  the  Animal  Liberation  Front   ALF   who  defaced  the  website  of  a  fur  and  leather retailer. The hacker also added the following message to the content of the site:  To the owners of “The twisted pine fur and leather company” you have no excuse to sale [sic] the flesh, skin and fur of another creature. Your website lacks security. To the customers, you have no right to buy the flesh, skin or fur of another creature. You deserve this. You’re lucky this is the only data we dumped. Exploiters, you’ve been warned. Expect us.  Can you really put that much faith into the security of a company that sales [sic] the fur, skin and flesh of  dead animals to make a profit?  We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. We are antisec. We are operation liberate. Expect us.  This  simple  message  quickly  expressed  their  point  of  view  and  disagreement  with  the company’s practices. In addition, the hackers indicated that they were able to view the customer  database  information  maintained  by  the  company,  and  that  they  could potentially steal the credit and debit card information of individuals who had purchased goods through the site.  This sort of attack is what some researchers refer to as hacktivism, in that the actors use hacking techniques to promote an activist agenda or express their opinion  Denning, 2010; Jordan and Taylor, 2004; Taylor, 1999 . Such an attack may be illegal, but it does not  create  a  high  degree  of  fear  or  concern  among  the  larger  community   Jordan  and Taylor, 2004 . As a result, hacktivism provides a way to classify criminal acts of protest involving hacking techniques that are in some way analogous to offline political action  Denning, 2010 . The use of this term, however, does not help refine our understanding of cybercrime or terror, as it is more a nebulous concept than anything else.  For more on hacktivism, go online to:  1.  https:  opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com 2013 01 13 what-is-a-hacktivist  2.  www.thenation.com article 154780 wikileaks-and-hacktivist-culture.  388   At the most extreme end of political expression are planned acts of violence in support of a social agenda, typically referred to as terror  Schmid, 2004 . This may include the creation of major explosions, such as the Oklahoma City bombings of the early 1990s in the  USA,  or  the  9 11  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Center.  These  incidents  can  cause massive harm to both people and property, and generate fear of future attacks  Martin, 2006; Schmid, 2004; Schmid and Jongman, 2005 . Although there is no single agreed-upon definition  for  what  constitutes  an  act  of  physical  terror,  these  elements  are  present  in almost all of the existing frameworks used  Schmid and Jongman, 2005 .  The definitional issues present for physical terror are exacerbated when attempting to define what constitutes cyberterror. In fact, the term cyberterror developed in the mid- 1990s  as  technology  was  increasingly  adopted  by  consumers  and  industry  alike   Foltz, 2004 .  Increasing  focus  was  placed  on  defining  physical  terror  through  the  use  of violence to promote fear; this challenged the notion of cyberterror, since there have been few instances where individuals in the real world have experienced any physical harm from a cyber-attack  Britz, 2010; Denning, 2010; Foltz, 2004; Martin, 2006; Pollitt, 1998 .  An  attack  against  the  electronic  infrastructure  supporting  financial  institutions  or power  grids,  however,  could  produce  a  catastrophic  loss  of  service  that  results  in economic harm or disruption of vital services  Brenner, 2008; Britz, 2010; Brodscky and Radvanovsky,  2010;  Denning,  2010 .  For  instance,  if  an  attacker  was  able  to  knock  out power  to  a  major  city,  this  could  potentially  result  in  significant  dollar  losses  for corporations and lead to physical death if outages affected hospitals or medical services. The unexpected nature of such an attack would also, no doubt, generate panic over the prospect of future attacks occurring with almost no warning. Such fear and concern over cyber-attacks  may  rival  that  of  a  physical  terror  incident   Britz,  2010;  Denning,  2010; Kilger,  2010 .  As  a  result,  physical  harm  may  be  less  relevant  in  the  definition  of cyberterrorism compared to the fear that may stem from such an attack.  It is also important to recognize that some terror or extremist groups may not attempt to  use  the  Internet  as  an  attack  vehicle.  Instead,  they  may  simply  find  value  in  using online  communications  in  order  to  contact  others,  spread  their  message  globally,  and engage  in  fundraising  activities  to  support  their  cause   Britz,  2010;  Foltz,  2004 .  For instance,  there  has  been  substantial  concern  over  ISIS  using  various  encrypted applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram to communicate  Rotella, 2016 . The use of various  instant  messaging  protocols  makes  it  difficult  to  track  actor  networks  and validate threats  see Box 10.2 for details .  389   Box 10.2 The use of encrypted chat applications by  terrorists  https:  techcrunch.com 2016 01 16 isis-app .  ISIS has its own encrypted chat app  Terrorists  are  communicating  over  a  new  secure  Android  app  after  getting  kicked  off  WhatsApp, Telegram, and other messengers. Called “Alrawi,” the encrypted chat app makes it harder for governments and security agencies to spy on terrorist plans.  This article provides an overview of the emergence of a new app being used by ISIS to shield its communications from government agencies and counterterror groups. The  article  also  explains  why  ISIS  and  other  groups  are  using  encrypted  apps developed in-house rather than continuing to use popular messaging apps due to the risk of identification. The implications of these developments for not only terrorist group planning but also counter-terrorism efforts are explained as well.  With  that  in  mind,  a  truly  expansive  definition  of  cyberterror  must  recognize  the variations that may be evident in the way an organization uses technology to further its agenda.  Criminologist  Marjie  Britz   2010:  97   has  developed  an  inclusive  definition  for cyberterror that recognizes both of these issues:  The  premeditated,  methodological,  ideologically  motivated  dissemination  of  information,  facilitation  of communication,  or  attack  against  physical  targets,  digital  information,  computer  systems,  and or  computer programs which is intended to cause social, financial, physical, or psychological harm to noncombatant targets and  audiences  for  the  purpose  of  affecting  ideological,  political,  or  social  change;  or  any  utilization  of  digital communication or information which facilitates such actions directly or indirectly.  We  will  use  this  definition  in  order  to  frame  the  remainder  of  this  chapter  so  as  to recognize the various ways in which extremists and terrorists use technology to further their agendas online and offline.  390   The role of nation-state vs. non-nation-state attacks  Since technology may be used to facilitate acts of crime or terror, we must consider the source of an attack and how this might relate to the actor’s motivation and target. With that in mind, we must define a nation-state and contextualize how it might engage in an  attack.  Creveld   1999   argues  that  a  nation-state  has  three  characteristics:   1  sovereignty,  2  territoriality, and  3  abstract organization status. Sovereignty involves the authority or power to rule, as well as to make and enforce laws within a given area. Territoriality  recognizes  that  a  state  or  governing  body  exerts  power  within  specific, recognized  borders   Creveld,  1999 .  The  idea  of  “abstract  organization”  involves  the concept that each state has a distinct and independent persona which is separate from that  of  its  people.  Specifically,  the  state  is  a  political  entity,  while  the  culture  and or ethnic composition of a place makes up its national identity  Creveld, 1999 . For instance, the  USA  utilizes  a  democratic  system  of  government,  while  its  national  identity  is  a cultural  mélange  of  various  heritages  and  backgrounds  based  on  the  influx  of immigrants over time.  Given their sovereignty and territorial control, nation-states have the capacity to exert influence  over  their  citizens,  as  well  as  other  nation-states,  in  order  to  further  their interests. As a result, some nation-states may utilize their citizen populations to engage in illegal activities in order to gain either economic or political advantage over another nation. For instance, a nation-state may encourage individual citizens to engage in the theft of trade secrets or intellectual property in order to gain economic advantage over another  country  with  which  they  must  compete  in  the  open  market.  The  originating nation may offer indirect economic support to actors in order to facilitate their activities, but it does not provide any overt recognition or direct orders that can be traced back to the government. Thus, the use of state-sponsored actors allows a government to perform illegal activities without directly engaging in the act.  The role of state sponsorship in cyber-attacks that involve hacking and data theft has gained substantial attention over the past two decades. One of the most notable incidents of the past few years involved a major attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment in the USA. In 2014, a group calling itself Guardians of Peace  GOP   hacked Sony Pictures Headquarters  and  notified  the  company  of  the  compromise  by  flashing  a  message featuring a red skull on every employee’s computer, stating: “if you don’t obey us, we’ll release  data  shown  below  to  the  world”   Robb,  2014 .  The  hackers  used  a  variety  of malware  tools  to  compromise  the  network,  eventually  obtaining  as  much  as  100 terabytes of data from the company, including personal emails, scripts, and details on all employees.  The  hackers  dumped  massive  amounts  of  intellectual  property  and  personal information online, including films that had not yet been released in theaters, details on  391   employee  salaries,  medical  histories,  and  embarrassing  email  exchanges  between executives regarding various actors and film projects  Robb, 2014 . They also threatened Sony  employees  with  physical  violence,  and  eventually  any  US  movie  theater  if  they screened  the  film The Interview,  a  comedy  where  two  reporters  attempt  to  assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  Robb, 2014 .  While it is possible that these attacks were driven by individual hackers without state support, it is important to note the massive quantity of data acquired by the hackers, and the  use  of  somewhat  sophisticated  attack  tools  suggest  that  these  were  no  ordinary economically  motivated  hackers   Zetter,  2016 .  In  addition,  the  fact  that  they  targeted Sony Pictures and made no attempt to sell the information they acquired or blackmail the company, but rather dumped it online in multiple batches over time, appears to be designed  to  embarrass  the  company  and  its  employees   Robb,  2014 .  The  eventual expressed  interest  of  the  hackers  to  prevent  the  company  from  releasing  a  film  that painted  North  Korea  in  a  negative  light,  even  including  threats  of  physical  violence  Robb, 2014 , is more in keeping with the interests of a nation-state rather than that of the  larger  criminal  hacker  community  that  seeks  access  to  sensitive  data.  Finally,  the source of these attacks has some connections to the nation of North Korea, including the use  of  malware  containing  Korean-language  characters  that  were  identified  in subsequent  attacks  against  South  Korean  targets   Zetter,  2016 .  All  of  these  points provide circumstantial evidence that the attacks were the result of state-sponsored actors working on behalf of the North Korean government  Zetter, 2016 .  The  lack  of  concrete  evidence  to  support  the  role  of  the  state  in  sanctioning  this activity makes it difficult to identify a clear policy response. It may be best to treat this incident  as  a  crime  due  to  the  lack  of  substantial  evidence  that  the  North  Korean government  ordered  this  attack  to  take  place.  The  totality  of  circumstances  would suggest it is something greater than a crime, but the use of a military response may not be appropriate. As a result, the US government engaged in a series of economic sanctions against the North Korean government in retaliation for the attacks  Robb, 2014 . As such, the use of actors with no direct ties to a government entity makes it difficult to clearly define this incident as an act of crime, espionage, or war.  By  contrast,  individuals  operating  without  state  sponsorship,  or  non-nation-state- sponsored  actors,  tend  to  have  fewer  resources  at  their  disposal  and  may  target resources  differently  in  order  to  affect  the  operational  capabilities  of  a  government  or corporation, gain a direct profit from data theft, or cause fear among a population. Their attacks  may  not  be  as  sophisticated  as  those  used  by  nation-states,  but  they  can  still prove  effective,  depending  on  the  target  of  an  attack.  In  addition,  actors  without  state sponsorship do not have to operate within specific military hierarchies of command and may organize in any way necessary in order to succeed. This does not mean that there are not leaders within groups; they may be driven by a small core of actors who come together and rally others to their cause. Often, this may be done through the use of web forums, IRC, instant messaging groups, and social networking sites that enable the rapid formation  of  groups.  Thus,  non-nation-state-sponsored  actors  can  more  quickly  come  392   together to complete attacks with a wide network of participants who can just as rapidly disband upon completion of the act in the absence of chains of command or hierarchies. One  excellent  example  of  non-nation-state-sponsored  attacks  based  on  loosely connected actors is a series of DDoS attacks against US financial institutions beginning in the fall of 2012 by the group Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters  Gonsalves, 2013 . The attacks themselves were directed at US Bank-corp, JP Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America,  PNC  Financial  Services  Group,  SunTrust,  and  other  institutions.  The  group utilized compromised web servers located in the USA as a launch point and caused some interruptions  of  service  for  the  banks.  It  is  not  clear  how  successful  the  attacks  were, though one estimate suggests at least seven banks were taken down for minutes to hours, depending on the institution  Gonsalves, 2013 .  The group indicated in posts on the website Pastebin that they were engaging in the attacks  because  of  the  treatment  of  the  Islamic  faith  by  the  West  and  the  US government’s refusal to remove clips of a movie that disparages the prophet Mohammed from YouTube  see Box 10.3 for details . They claimed that they would engage in attacks against banks as retribution for these videos and base the duration of their attacks on the perceived  damages  that  will  result  against  these  institutions  relative  to  the  number  of times  these  videos  have  been  viewed  and  the  length  of  time  they  have  been  posted. While  some  of  these  institutions  were  able  to  use  mitigation  services  to  reduce  the effectiveness  of  the  DDoS  attacks,  it  is  likely  the  attacks  will  continue  so  long  as  the Cyber Fighters feel they are accomplishing some goal.  Box 10.3 Ultimatum For DDoS attacks against US banks  http:  pastebin.com EEWQhA0j.  Operation  Ababil,  AlQASSAM  ULTIMATUM.  [.]  We,  the  Cyber  Fighters  of  Izz  ad-Din  al-Qassam,  had previously warned multiple times that, if the insulting movies not be removed from the Internet we will resume the Operation Ababil.  This  story  provides  the  details  of  the  Cyber  Fighters’  campaign  against  various financial institutions in the USA beginning in February 2013 as retaliation for the publication  of  a  video  on  YouTube  that  insulted  the  image  of  the  Prophet Mohammed. The announcement includes their future targets and demands.  Since  the  individual  hackers  engaging  in  these  attacks  appeared  to  be  motivated  393   entirely  by  their  religious  backgrounds  to  target  and  affect  business  endeavors,  it  is reasonable  to  suggest  that  this  is  a  crime.  The  religious  component  and  the  desire  to change the attitudes and behaviors of the nation and the stance of those who posted the content may also lead some to call these attacks hacktivism. Regardless, it is important to consider how the role of state associations may affect both the activities of the attackers and the way in which an incident is defined.  394   The use of the Internet in the indoctrination and recruitment of extremist groups  Due to the prospective variations in the behavior and motives of actors, it is necessary to consider how technology may be used and to what ends. First and foremost, the Internet has  tremendous  value  as  a  communications  vehicle  for  extremists,  terror  entities,  and nation-state  actors.  The  easy  and  immediate  access  to  technology,  coupled  with  the anonymity  and  scale  afforded  by  computers  and  the  Internet,  make  email,  forums, instant  messaging,  and  virtually  all  other  forms  of  CMC  ideal  for  interpersonal communications.  Almost  every  nation  on  earth  now  has  some  form  of  Internet connectivity,  whether  through  cellular  service  providers,  high-speed  fiber  optic connectivity, or even dial-up Internet access. Groups can maintain contact and reach out to others, no matter where they may be located, through plain text messages, email, or forums.  The ability to communicate regularly with others from diverse backgrounds ensures that  individuals  can  be  slowly  but  steadily  introduced  to  the  core  principles  of  a movement   Gerstenfeld,  Grant,  and  Chiang,  2003;  Gruen,  2005;  Weimann,  2005 . Constant  exposure  to  and  reinforcement  of  an  ideology  allows  individuals  to  become accepting  of  an  otherwise  unusual  perspective,  and  it  may  eventually  enable  the acceptance  of  an  extremist  ideology  or  identity   Gersten-feld  et  al.,  2003 .  There  are myriad  web  forums  operating  to  support  various  white  nationalist  and  neo-Nazi ideologies,  including  The  Daily  Stormer,  the  National  Socialist  Movement   NSM ,  and even portions of the relatively broad Reddit community  Hankes, 2015 . One of the oldest of  these  forums  is  Stormfront.org,  which  is  extremely  popular  among  neo-Nazis  to discuss  all  facets  of  their  movement  and  even  day-to-day  activities  through  a  white- power perspective  Castle, 2011; Gerstenfeld et al., 2003; Weimann, 2005 . The site serves as a venue for individuals to engage in conversations and connect with others virtually and through the real world via localized subforums by nation, state, and city. There are also multiple sections devoted to politics, technology, philosophy, and entertainment.  For  more  information  on  Stormfront  in  their  own  words,  go  online  to:  www.stormfront.org forum .  395   In  addition  to  direct  communications,  the  Internet  also  allows  groups  to  directly communicate their beliefs and ideologies to the world without the need for mass-media marketing or news media coverage. Any terror or extremist group can post messages on blogs or websites in order to directly control the delivery of their message to the media and  the  public  at  large   Forest,  2009 .  For  instance,  members  of  the  hacker  group Anonymous regularly use Twitter, YouTube, and even written letters posted on websites in order to explain their actions or notify prospective targets that they may be attacked  see Box 10.4 for details .  Box 10.4 Anonymous open letter example  Greetings Citizens of the World, We are Anonymous  This  is  an  open  call  to  establish  travel  bans  on  United  States  citizens,  boycott  US made products, divest of US or Trump related business interests, and apply sanctions on  the  Trump  regime  and  all  of  its  associates.  Until  the  danger  the  United  States today possesses against the world is resolved. Reciprocity measures must be enacted against the United States to challenge its shameless actions under the Trump regime. Global  response  must  also  come  in  the  form  of  economic  sanctions  on  products directly associated with the Trump corporate brand.  As citizens of the world we must unite against tyranny wherever it emerges and challenge it. As Trump reveals himself to be a danger not just for the US but the rest of the international community it is our right to protect and defend ourselves from the madness of rogue entity with no regard for international law, human rights, or common decency.  We  call  on  the  international  community  from  all  backgrounds  and  ideologies, across social stratas and religions, to resist the madness leaking out of the United States. We call for the creation of global boycotts against US made products, we call on you to contact your representatives and members of parliament and congress to apply sanctions on the Trump regime, we call on you to take part in divestment of US shares. BDS the US until the maleficent Trump regime is brought to justice.  To  the  citizens  of  the  United  States,  this  is  not  an  attack  on  you  but  firm  and necessary  action  against  the  rising  tyranny  that  today  befalls  you.  Participate  in your  own  liberation  from  the  Trump  regime  by  applying  economic  and  political pressure on your house and senate representatives to push the impeachment of the Trump regime. The Trump regime will not listen to protests in the streets, but it will crumble  under  protests  in  the  work  force  &  sanctions,  divestment,  and  boycotts abroad. We call on you, the citizens of the United States, to organize rolling work strikes nationwide. Remove your labour from the pockets of the tyrants, disrupt the  396   markets  they  are  so  proud  of,  and  take  the  reins  of  your  governance  back  by building  society  and  mass  collaboration.  Forget  making  America  great  again, together we can make humanity great again.  We are Anonymous. We are everywhere. We are legion. We are those you have left without a home. We are those you have murdered. We are voiceless no more. The world will change. We’ll change it.  Tyrants of the World, Expect Us!  The  Islamic  State  also  uses  Twitter  as  a  key  platform  for  recruitment  and radicalization.  The  relatively  limited  territories  which  ISIS  controls  offline  in  Iraq  and Syria demand that they find ways to attract individuals to their ideology, making social media play an essential role in promoting their message to recruit participants globally. Twitter is a vital resource, as individuals can create accounts easily and use them even from basic mobile phones. The use of hash-tags in Twitter messaging also allows ISIS to find  ways  to  reach  the  top  trending  tags  to  ensure  they  are  seen  by  a  broad  audience  Berger and Morgan, 2015 . These practices, however, also make it possible for Twitter to identify and suspend accounts engaged in ISIS posting, although many suspended users are  able  to  get  back  on  the  service  almost  immediately.  They  treat  a  suspension  as  a badge of honor, validating that they are truly members of the movement and that they continue to operate in the face of Western security strategies  Stewart and Maremont, 2016 .  To  that  end,  ISIS  operates  a  coordinated  campaign  of  posting,  using  a  network  of thousands of accounts, some live actors and some that are bots, to immediately retweet any  messages  posted  by  main  accounts  within  the  organization   Berger  and  Morgan, 2015 . In addition to messaging, ISIS recruiters will attempt to engage any individuals in conversation who appear sympathetic to their cause  see Box 10.5 for an example . Their conversations transition from simple discussions of Islam or of the movement, to more engaged  long-form  conversations  on  Skype  or  other  platforms,  including  messaging applications  created  specifically  for  ISIS  to  use   Stewart  and  Maremont,  2016 . Eventually,  the  individual  may  be  radicalized  and  encouraged  to  either  engage  in violence in their home nation,  or to travel to  the Middle East to  join the fight for the Caliphate in Iraq.  Box 10.5 The role of social media in recruitment and  397   radicalization  www.nytimes.com 2015 06 28 world americas isis-online-recruiting-american.html.  ISIS and the lonely young American  She  kept  teaching  at  her  church,  but  her  truck’s  radio  was  no  longer  tuned  to  the  Christian  hits  on  K- LOVE. Instead, she hummed along with the ISIS anthems blasting out of her turquoise iPhone, and began daydreaming about what life with the militants might be like.  This  article  details  one  young  woman’s  experience  engaging  with,  and  eventually accepting, the radical ideology promoted by ISIS. She engaged in discussions with members  of  ISIS  via  various  social  media  feeds,  eventually  engaging  in  regular conversations and even converting to Islam. Her story provides an excellent example of  the  types  of  individuals  ISIS  and  other  radical  movements  seek  out,  and  the processes they employ to indoctrinate them.  Computers  and  software  suites  for  multimedia  creation,  like  Photoshop,  also  allow groups to create and manipulate videos, photos, and stylized text. This enables extremist groups to develop more media-friendly materials or misrepresent facts in support of their own ideologies. In turn, they can promote their ideas and images to a larger audience in a subtle and convincing way that may instill anger and hostility toward groups that are perceived as oppressors or socially unacceptable  Forest, 2009; Gruen, 2005 .  The terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula  AQAP  operates an English- language magazine called Inspire which provides information on the perspectives of the group  and  the  jihadist  movement  generally.  An  issue  from  March  2013  featured  an article on the 11 public figures from the West who it feels should be wanted dead or alive for crimes against Islam  Watson, 2013 . It also features regular details on techniques to engage in terrorism, ranging from simple bomb making to how to handle firearms.  The glossy magazine format allows the authors to promote their agenda in a way that is both attractive and appealing to readers. At the same time, the writing style may be more  engaging  and  promote  the  jihadist  agenda  to  those  who  may  never  have considered  this  point  of  view   Watson,  2013 .  In  fact,  the  Tsarnaev  brothers  who performed the Boston Marathon bombing frequently sought and read extremist websites  398   and  the  magazine  Inspire  which  served  as  the  basis  for  their  method  of  attack.  The brothers  acquired  the  information  needed  to  build  improvised  explosive  devices  from pressure  cookers,  nails,  ball-bearings,  and  explosive  materials  via  articles  published  in the magazine  Cooper, Schmidt, and Schmidt, 2013 .  For more information on the magazine Inspire and its role in radicalization, go online  to:  www.dailymail.co.uk news article-2287003 Al-Qaeda-releases-guide- torch-cars-make-bombs-naming-11-public-figures-wants-dead-alive-latest-edition- glossy-magazine.html.  In much the same way, the extremist group Stormwatch operates a website about the civil  rights  leader  Dr.  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.,  which  appears  to  discuss  his  role  as  an activist  martinlutherking.org, 2013 . The content of the site, however, decries his role in the  pursuit  of  equality  and  suggests  that  he  was  actually  a  mouthpiece  for  Jews  and Communists,  in  keeping  with  the  perceptions  of  the  White  Supremacist  movement generally  Weimann, 2005 . It is written in a relatively persuasive fashion that may make an unsuspecting reader with little knowledge of King’s role in social change believe the content  to  be  factual.  For  instance,  the  writers  argue  King  to  be  a  fraud  and  not  a religious man by taking facts and quotes out of context. In fact, they repeatedly argue that he stole materials from other figures and claimed them as his own, stating:  The  first  book  that  King  wrote,  “Stride  Toward  Freedom,”  –  was  plagiarized  from  numerous  sources,  all unattributed, according to documentation recently assembled by sympathetic King scholars Keith D. Miller, Ira G. Zepp, Jr., and David J. Garrow.  And no less an authoritative source than the four senior editors of “The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr.” –  an  official  publication  of  the  Martin  Luther  King  Center  for  Nonviolent  Social  Change,  Inc.,  whose  staff includes  King’s  widow  Coretta ,  stated  of  King’s  writings  at  both  Boston  University  and  Crozer  Theological Seminary: “Judged retroactively by the standards of academic scholarship, [his writings] are tragically flawed by numerous instances of plagiarism. [.] Appropriated passages are particularly evident in his writings in his major field of graduate study, systematic theology. ”  This content derides the success of King and argues that there should be no national holiday or recognition of his work. In fact, they provide a link to downloadable flyers about these issues which reads, “Bring the Dream to life in your town! Download flyers to  pass  out  at  your  school.”  These  are  excellent  examples  of  the  way  in  which multimedia content can be used by extremist groups to help indoctrinate individuals into their ideological or political worldview.  399   In  addition,  cell  phone  cameras  and  web  cams  allow  individuals  to  create  training videos and share these resources with others through video-sharing sites like YouTube  Gruen,  2005 .  Posting  videos  and  news  stories  through  social  media  also  provides  a mechanism to publicly refute claims made by media and governments to ensure that the group  is  presented  in  a  positive  light   Forest,  2009;  Gruen,  2005 .  For  instance, participants in the recent Arab Spring created videos on camera phones to show violent repression by government and police agencies, as it happened, to news agencies around the world  Stepanova, 2011 . Similarly, ISIS members have posted videos of the conflict in the city of Mosul, Iraq, and other parts of the country where they have attempted to take control of the population. Their videos are intended to validate or refute claims by the US military and coalition forces regarding their attempts to retake cities where ISIS has  dug  in   Tawfeeq,  Formanek,  and  Narayan,  2016 .  Such  “on  the  ground”  reporting allows individuals to provide evidence of their experiences.  This same capability, however, can be abused by extremist groups in support of their ideologies.  One  of  the  most  extreme  examples  of  such  an  act  was  a  video  posted  by members  of  Al  Qaeda  in  Pakistan  on  February  21,  2002.  In  the  video,  members  of  the group  executed  a  journalist  named  Daniel  Pearl  who  was  kidnapped  while  he  was traveling  to  conduct  an  interview   Levy,  2003 .  He  stated  his  name  for  the  camera, described  his  Jewish  family  heritage,  and  then  condemned  America’s  foreign  policy strategies in the Middle East. Following these statements, his captors then slit his throat and  cut  off  his  head,  ending  the  video  with  a  statement  demanding  the  release  of  all Guantanamo  Bay  detainees,  or  otherwise  more  deaths  would  result   Levy,  2003 .  The gruesome  video  became  a  key  piece  of  propaganda  for  the  group  and  the  jihadist movement generally, while inciting massive outrage in the USA. Such a chilling example demonstrates  the  value  of  interactive  media  and  the  Internet  in  the  promotion  of extremist movements generally  see Box 10.6 for an additional example .  Box 10.6 An example of Facebook live being used for  terrorism  www.mirror.co.uk news world-news isis-killers-chilling-facebook-live-8190208.  ISIS killer's chilling Facebook live video threatening Euro 2016 minutes  400   after murdering police chief and wife  Homegrown  jihadist  Larossi  Abballa  broadcast  his  extremist  views  on  a  Facebook  live  stream  after repeatedly stabbing Jean-Baptiste Salvaing and his wife at their home on the outskirts of Paris last night.  This  article  details  the  messages  Larossi  Abballa  posted  via  Facebook  live  after stabbing two people to death while holding their 3-year-old child hostage, including his thoughts on the ways in which the French were increasing the threat of terror attacks based on their policies toward Muslim nations. The article demonstrates the value  of  live  streaming  content  for  extremists  and  radical  groups  to  promote messages of violence to the world.  In  addition  to  video,  social  movements  on  the  fringes  of  society  have  successfully utilized music and video games as a means to expose individuals to their perspectives in socially  acceptable  and  engaging  ways   Britz,  2010;  Weimann,  2005 .  For  instance, Resistance Records is a record label that produces and distributes music by bands that feature white power and right-wing extremist messages in a direct-downloadable format  Jipson,  2007 .  The  label  is  owned  and  run  by  the  National  Alliance,  a  white  power group, which gains a profit from album sales. Music allows what are otherwise extreme or  socially  unacceptable  positions  to  be  heard  in  ways  that  may  appeal  to  younger generations or the general public.  Video games have also become a key resource for extremist groups to promote their beliefs in a socially acceptable, approachable, and extremely engaging way to younger audiences.  The  rewards  and  reinforcement  which  individuals  can  receive  through successfully completing the objectives of a game, coupled with the underlying themes of the content, can promote an extremist view in a very digestible format. One of the most well-known  of  these  games  is  called  Ethnic  Cleansing,  which  was  developed  and released  through  Resistance  Records  using  no-cost  open-source  software.  This  is  a  so- called  “first-person  shooter,”  wherein  the  game  is  played  from  the  point  of  view  of  a skinhead or Klansman who kills blacks, Jews, and Latinos in various urban and subway environments   Anti-Defamation  League,  2002 .  This  game,  and  its  sequel,  White  Law, costs  $14.99  and,  may  be  downloaded  directly  through  the  Resistance  Records  website  Anti-Defamation  League,  2002 .  Similarly,  Islamic  extremists  have  released  several video  games  that  place  the  player  in  the  role  of  a  jihadist  fighting  against  Jews, Westerners, and the US military  Gruen, 2005 . The content utilizes pro-Islamic imagery, rap  and  popular  music,  as  well  as  various  images  of  and  messages  from  Osama  Bin Laden and the 9 11 terror attacks. The game has been posted and reposted across various websites online, ensuring its spread to various interested groups  Weimann, 2005 .  In addition to lifestyle publications and materials that encourage or support extremist ideologies,  there  are  a  number  of  training  and  support  manuals  distributed  online.  In fact, the open nature of the World Wide Web allows individuals to post information that could be used to engage in violence or cause physical harm in the real world. There are a  401   number  of  training  manuals  and  detailed  tutorials  for  bomb  making,  gun  play,  and improvised weapons use on the Internet, many of which have been available online for years   Wall,  2001 .  This  is  because  individuals  can  easily  post  a  text  file  or  word processor  document  and  repost  it  in  repositories,  send  via  email,  or  share  via  social networks  in  different  formats  and  languages.  For  example,  the  Mujahadeen  Poisons Handbook  from  Hamas  and  the  Encyclopedia  of  Jihad  published  by  Al  Qaeda  are available in various online outlets  Weimann, 2005 . Even the Earth Liberation Front and Animal  Liberation  Front  have  tutorials  on  how  to  engage  in  civil  disobedience  and protests against logging companies, construction sites, and animal testing facilities  Holt, 2012 . These resources engender planning and tactical strategy development, regardless of the expertise of the individuals in a given area.  For an example of a tactical manual, go online to: www.direkteaktie.net osh .  402   Electronic attacks by extremist groups  Although  the  communications  capability  afforded  by  the  Internet  is  unparalleled,  it  is also important to consider how these technologies could serve as a target for attacks by extremists, terror groups, and even nation-states. The range of interconnected computer systems and sensitive data that could be compromised online presents a diverse array of high-value targets for attackers  Britz, 2010; Denning, 2010; Holt, 2012; Kilger, 2010 . For instance, individuals could immediately target financial institutions in order to limit the functionality of online banking systems or harm databases of consumer information in order  to  cause  chaos.  Alternatively,  attackers  may  target  the  computer  systems  that support  the  processes  within  nuclear  power  plants,  hydroelectric  dams,  or  sewage treatment  plants.  These  systems,  called  Supervisory  Control  and  Data  Acquisition Systems  SCADA , are vital to the management and processing of critical infrastructure and  are  often  connected  to  the  Internet  in  some  fashion   Brodscky  and  Radvanovsky, 2010 . As a result, an attacker who can affect the functionality of these computers may cause substantial physical harm in the real world along with fear over future attacks  see Box 10.7 for details; also Brenner, 2011; Denning, 2010 .  Box 10.7 Examples of cyber-attacks against SCADA  systems in water treatment  www.infosecisland.com blogview 18281-ICS-Cybersecurity-Water-Water- Everywhere.html  ICS cyber-security: water, water everywhere  Since then there have been numerous articles and events that have driven the public conversation about the security of the cyber systems at American water treatment facilities. The question at hand is whether this moment of attention will result in any improvements in cybersecurity of the nation’s water supply.  This  article  provides  a  timeline  of  the  cyber-security  incidents  that  have  occurred  403   over the past two decades that specifically target water management systems. The piece  is  invaluable  in  understanding  the  ways  in  which  systems  have  been compromised and what this may mean for the future.  The use of cyber-attacks by extremist groups is infrequent, though they are facilitated in part by the nature of information sharing in the hacker subculture  see Chapter 3; also Britz,  2010;  Denning,  2010 .  Hackers  regularly  provide  information  on  vulnerabilities present in the software and hardware of systems across the world  Taylor, 1999 . This information can be leveraged by anyone with the time or inclination to identify systems with this vulnerability and attempt to attack them. As a result, open disclosure may do more  to  facilitate  attacks  than  to  provide  public  awareness  of  weaknesses.  In  fact, hackers in support of Al Qaeda have posted various resources to facilitate cyber-attacks, such  as  Youni  Tsoulis,  who  published  a  hacker  tutorial  entitled  The  Encyclopedia  of Hacking  the  Zionist  and  Crusader  Websites   Denning,  2010 .  This  guide  provided detailed information on vulnerabilities in US cyber infrastructure, as well as techniques to  engage  in  data  theft  and  malware  infections.  In  addition,  the  ability  to  obtain  free attack tools or malware and hacking resources through open markets  see Chapters 3 and 4   reduces  the  amount  of  resource  development  needed  to  successfully  complete  an attack.  Thus,  the  modern  hacker  subculture  facilitates  both  legitimate  and  illegitimate hacking behaviors which can be used by any motivated actor.  One  of  the  most  common  types  of  attack  used  in  support  of  extremist  or  terror agendas  is  the  denial  of  service  attack   DDoS    Denning,  2010;  Kilger,  2010 .  These attacks may not cause significant system damage, though the fact that they prevent users from  accessing  resources  can  cause  massive  dollar  losses.  In  addition,  they  can  be relatively  easy  to  perform  and  are  enabled  in  part  by  downloadable  tools  that  will complete the attack at the click of a mouse.  The history of downloadable DDoS tools stems from the hacker group the Electronic Disturbance  Theater   EDT;  Denning,  2010 .  The  group  developed  a  program  called FloodNet that could be downloaded directly from their website to be used by individuals who shared their perspectives on the use of the Internet as a space for social activism. It was first used in an attack against the Mexican government owing to their treatment of Zapatista separatists who were fighting against what they perceived to be governmental repression  Denning, 2010 . The EDT first used FloodNet against the Mexican President Zedillo’s  website,  and  then  attacked  US  President  Clinton’s  website  because  of  his support of Mexico. A third, and even larger, attack was then launched against Zedillo, the Pentagon, and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange for its role in supporting globalization  Denning, 2010 .  For more on the EDT, go online to: www.youtube.com watch?v=O-U-he8LN3k.  404   The success of FloodNet led to its adoption by other activist groups to engage in DDoS attacks,  such  as  an  attack  by  animal  rights  protesters  in  Sweden  and  a  British  group called  the  Electrohippies  Collective   Denning,  2010 .  In  more  recent  years,  additional DDoS tools have been developed by groups with diverse interests. For instance, a tool called Electronic Jihad was released through the Arabic-language forum al-Jinan for use against various Western targets  Denning, 2010 .  Anonymous  also  uses  a  DDoS  tool  called  the  Low  Orbit  Ion  Cannon   LOIC   in support of attacks against personal, industrial, and government targets around the world  Correll,  2010 .  This  simple  tool  allows  individuals  to  simply  select  a  website  to  target and  give  parameters  for  the  duration  of  the  attack,  then  click  the  ready  button.  LOIC requires  no  technical  knowledge  to  successfully  complete  an  attack;  the  interest  in targeting a specific entity is all that is necessary.  For  more  http:  sourceforge.net projects loic .  the   on   Low  Orbit   Ion  Cannon,   go   online   to:  Another useful tool in the arsenal of hackers seeking to express their opinions are web defacements, where the normal HTML code of a web page is replaced by images, text, and content of the attacker’s choosing  see Chapter 3; Denning, 2010; Woo et al.,  2004 . Web defacements began as a vehicle for hackers to call out system administrators who used poor security protocols and to generate a reputation in the hacker community for their  actions   Woo  et al.,  2004 .  As  hackers  increasingly  recognized  the  value  of  web defacements as a means to express their political or ideological motives, the nature and targets for defacements began to change.  Specifically, web defacements appear increasingly to be triggered in response to real- world events. For instance, the Turkish military shot down a Russian fighter jet within its borders on November 24, 2015 on the basis that it was from an unknown country of origin at the time of the incident and was nonresponsive to repeated requests to change  405   direction  BBC, 2015 . The Russian government contended that the jet was engaging in a bombing  run  as  part  of  their  operations  in  fighting  ISIS  within  Syria,  which  borders Turkey. Shortly after this incident, the Turkish web infrastructure was hit with a DDoS attack by hackers claiming to be part of Anonymous, indicating that this was revenge for the  Turkish  government’s  support  of  ISIS   Cimpanu,  2016 .  Turkish  hacker  groups responded by engaging in a campaign of web defacements and attacks against Russian websites,  including  defacing  the  websites  of  the  Russian  Embassy  in  Israel   Cimpanu, 2016  and the Russia Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for Reconstruction and Development  Waqas, 2016 .  In light of the ways in which the Internet may be used by ideologically driven groups in  order  to  affect  action  or  cause  harm,  we  will  now  explore  two  different  extremist group subcultures and their online activities:  1  the Radical Far Right movement, and  2  the e-jihad.  The Radical Far Right online  The term “the Radical Far Right” is often associated with white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, though it can actually be applied as an umbrella term to capture the collective  of  groups  with  overlapping  perspectives,  such  as  neo-Nazi  groups,  white nationalists, Aryan skinheads, and other Christian separatist movements. In addition, the term  Alt-Right  or  Alternative  Right  has  been  used  to  characterize  aspects  of  these movements  in  an  attempt  to  rebrand  these  ideologies.  Although  they  have  different individual views, they generally share a framework that the white race has been harmed by non-white racial and ethnic groups, Jews, and Catholics. These groups operate around the  world  and  take  various  forms.  The  Southern  Poverty  Law  Center   2017   suggested that there were 917 active hate groups operating in the USA in 2017. Although they are spread across the country, the white power movement is  For  more  information  on  the  different  types  of  hate  groups  in  the  USA  and where they are located, go online to: www.splcenter.org hate-map.  most prominent in the South, upper Midwest, and Southwestern United States. Similar groups  are  evident  in  Europe  and  Asia,  including  the  National  Socialist  Movement,  406   which has offshoots in England and the Philippines  National Socialist Movement, 2014 . The value of the Internet for the Radical Far Right movement cannot be understated. Technology  allows  individuals  from  marginalized  communities  across  the  world  to become indoctrinated into the culture and to find social support for their attitudes and beliefs  over  time.  Donald  Black,  former  KKK  member  and  founder  of  the  website Stormfront, stated that “whereas we previously could only reach people with pamphlets and by sending out tabloid papers to a limited number of people or holding rallies with no more than a few hundred people – now we can reach potentially millions of people”  Faulk, 1997 . Considering he made this statement in 1997, the white power movement has had a long history of Internet use.  For  more  www.splcenter.org fighting-hate extremist-files ideology alternative-right.  information   Alt-Right,   the   on   go   online   to:  Some  of  the  most  common  tools  used  by  the  Radical  Far  Right  movement  are websites, forums, chatrooms, blogs, and other forms of CMC. Individuals who find these sites may be initially directed to them through Google searches or links through radical church  websites   McNamee,  Peterson,  and  Pena,  2010 .  Spending  time  reading  the content and getting to know users may increase their willingness to accept their point of view.  In  fact,  continuous  involvement  in  these  sites  may  help  individuals  accept extremist perspectives, even if their peers or family do not agree with these positions. In addition, the ability to make multiple friends and associates online in addition to their real-world social relationships can help insulate their perceptions.  It  is  important  to  note  that  CMCs  used  by  these  movements  do  not  necessarily encourage violence. Some do and are overtly inflammatory in their language about the need to rise up in armed conflict or engage in a “race war”  McNamee et al., 2010 . Many sites and discussions, however, simply revolve around the importance of the movement and  the  need  to  develop  a  strong  white  race.  In  fact,  many  users  in  forums  and  other sites  communicate  their  interpretation  of  historical  events,  as  in  the  discussion  of  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. mentioned earlier in this chapter  McNamee et al.,  2010 .  They may also promote the idea that the white race has been appointed by God or by natural right to dominate the world over other races and ethnic groups  McNamee et al., 2010 . Constant exposure to these messages will help encourage an individual to believe them  407   and be drawn into the movement as a whole.  At  the  same  time,  the  Internet  allows  users  to  regularly  access  cultural  currency related to Far Right movements generally. For example, music became an important tool in the indoctrination of individuals through heavy metal bands and other musical styles in  the  mid-1990s   Simi  and  Futrell,  2006 .  Large  concert  venues  became  an  important rallying point, drawing multiple acts to play at day-long festivals. The development of e- commerce  sites  and  music-sharing  services  aided  the  spread  of  white  power  and  neo- Nazi music. In turn, the movement began to use music as a key resource to communicate their  message  through  accessible  media  that  may  be  more  engaging  to  youth  culture  Simi and Futrell, 2006 .  The ability to access the Web has also enabled individuals to develop lifestyle-related content that incorporates their racial attitudes  Simi and Futrell, 2006 . Images of tattoos, concerts, organized meetings, video games, music, and clothing are all easily identified via the Web. There are now even streaming music services available for those interested in white power bands. In addition, the group Women for Aryan Unity  WAU  publishes a  magazine  called  Home  Front  on  parenting  issues,  home  schooling,  and  ways  to socialize children into the movement. There are also child-specific materials available to download,  such  as  coloring  pages,  crosswords,  and  stories  that  are  “age  appropriate”  Simi  and  Futrell,  2006 .  They  can  also  get  positive  reinforcement  from  peers  and  ask questions about how to stay loyal to the movement despite the problems they may face from other parents. Thus, the Web is a key resource in the communication of subcultural values within radical movements as a whole.  The e-jihad  Over the past ten years, academic researchers and popular media have focused heavily on Al Qaeda, and more recently on ISIS, and their role in global terror activities  Forest, 2009;  Martin,  2006 .  Much  of  this  work  has  helped  inform  our  knowledge  of  the  real- world  threat  that  these  groups  pose,  though  there  has  generally  been  little  evidence demonstrating their role in successful cyber-attacks  Denning, 2010; Ulph, 2006 . There is, however, some evidence that loose associations of hacker groups are interested and attempting to engage in cyber-attacks against the West. This so-called e-jihad has ties to Al  Qaeda,  ISIS,  and  other  Islamic  extremist  groups  across  the  Middle  East  and  Africa, and depends on technology for communications infrastructure and as an attack platform  Denning, 2010; Ulph, 2006 .  The use of the Internet as a platform for e-jihad has been supported by a variety of individuals tied to Muslim extremist groups. For instance, Mohammad Bin Ahmad As-Sa -lim  wrote  a  book  entitled  39  Ways  to  Serve  and  Participate  in  Jihâd,  which  was designed to promote discussion about the issue of war with the West and jihad generally  Denning,  2010;  Leyden,  2003 .  The  book  discussed  the  issue  of  electronic  jihad  as  the thirty-fourth principal way to engage in jihad. He identifies the need for both discussion  408   forums  for  media  campaigns  and  more  specific  applications  of  hacking  techniques  in order to harm the West. Specifically, he wrote: “He [anyone with knowledge of hacking] should concentrate his efforts on destroying any American websites, as well as any sites that  are  anti-  Jihâd  and  Mujâhidîn,  Jewish  websites,  modernist  and  secular  websites”  As-Sa -lim, 2003 . Thus, terror groups realize that Western nations’ dependence on the Internet  for  both  commerce  and  communications  is  a  major  vulnerability  that  can  be exploited to cause economic harm and fear in the general populace.

To that end, the first hacker group to emerge with specific ties to Al Qaeda was the “al-Qaeda Alliance Online,” an offshoot of the hacker group “GForce Pakistan.” Members of the Alliance defaced a web server operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration   NOAA   on  October  17,  2001   McWilliams,  2001 .  The  defacement contained interesting, if not contradictory, information by condemning the September 11 attacks,  stating:  “bin  Laden  is  a  holy  fighter,  and  whatever  he  says  makes  sense”  McWilliams, 2001 . They went on to say that they would attack major websites in the USA and Britain, though “we will not hurt any data as its [ sic ] unethical”  McWilliams, 2001 .  A subsequent defacement occurred ten days later, on October 27, though that was the last attack attributed to the group  Denning, 2010 . It is not clear what happened to the Alliance, but it was replaced by a variety of forums and hacker groups actively engaged in  the  promotion  of  attacks  against  the  West  and  others  who  disparaged  the  Islamic faith.  For  instance,  the  al-Farouq  forum  established  a  section  encouraging  electronic jihad, along with a downloadable library of tools and tutorials for engaging in attacks  Denning,  2010;  Pool,  2005 .  Similarly,  the  al-Jinan  forum  created  and  offered  a  free download of a DoS tool called Electronic Jihad and gave awards and electronic medals to those  who  were  the  most  effective  attackers  against  sites  that  harmed  Islam   Bakier, 2007 .  One  of  the  most  well-known  examples  of  information  sharing  was  from  a  hacker named Youni Tsoulis, who used the handle Irhabi007. He developed multiple web forums and sites supporting Al Qaeda and even set up hidden links to propaganda websites on  409   various forums  Corera, 2008 . He also promoted hacking and gave multiple tutorials on hacker  sites  with  substantial  detail  on  methods  of  attack  and  tactics  to  compromise websites  Jamestown, 2008 . Due to the degree to which he actively engaged and shared information about cyber-attack techniques with others in the e-jihad movement, Tsouli came  to  the  attention  of  law  enforcement  and  military  agencies  around  the  world.  In fact,  his  name  was  found  on  a  laptop  belonging  to  a  member  of  an  Al  Qaeda  cell  in Bosnia  who  was  arrested  after  making  threatening  videos  against  various  European nations. Tsouli was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police during a raid in 2005 and was found guilty of charges under the Terrorism Act of 2000  Corera, 2008 . He received a 16-year sentence; he was 23 years old at the time.  More  recently,  Ardit  Ferizi  was  detained  in  Malaysia  in  October  2015  based  on allegations that he compromised US computer systems on behalf of ISIS  Perez, Shoichet, and Bruer, 2015 . Ferizi used the handle Th3Dir3ctorY, and admitted to compromising a server hosting a US company, enabling him to gain access to a database containing the personally  identifiable  information   PII   of  almost  1,300  military  and  government personnel  Department of Justice, 2016 . He then gave these data to Junaid Hussain, an ISIS recruiter, and discussed using the data to produce a hit-list based on the victims’ PII. The data then appeared in a tweet posted by the Islamic State Hacking Division  ISHD , claiming that they would pass the “personal information to the soldiers of the khilafah, who  soon  with  the  permission  of  Allah  will  strike  at  your  necks  in  your  own  lands!”  Department  of  Justice,  2016 .  He  was  extradited  to  the  USA  for  prosecution,  and  was eventually found guilty and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison on charges related to violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as providing material support to a terrorist organization.  These two incidents are examples of the few successes in the e-jihad campaign against the West. Other attempts have been less successful. For instance, individuals attempted to  engage  in  a  DoS  attack  against  the  Vatican  website  after  Pope  Benedict  made comments  about  the  Prophet  Mohammad  and  Islam  which  were  viewed  as  critical  of their  faith   Denning,  2010 .  Individuals  involved  in  the  e-jihad  also  planned  a coordinated series of attacks against US financial institutions and the stock exchange in 2006.  All  of  these  attacks  failed  to  materialize,  calling  into  question  the  skill  of  the attackers relative to the preparations taken to defend against such attacks  Alshech, 2007; Denning, 2010; Gross and McMillan, 2006 . This should not be taken as an indication that Al Qaeda, ISIS, and e-jihad should not be taken seriously, but rather that they recognize the  value  of  the  Internet  and  are  searching  for  ways  to  leverage  it  toward  effective attacks.  Box 10.8 Questioning the reality of cyberterror  This  chapter  provides  substantive  detail  on  the  role  of  the  Internet  in  facilitating communications,  fundraising,  and  planning  for  terror  groups.  There  is,  however,  410   scant  evidence  of  actual  cyber-attacks  performed  by  terrorist  groups.  Pundits  and politicians have heralded this potential for almost two decades since the coining of the phrase “digital Pearl Harbor.”  As  a  result,  some  scholars  argue  that  the  absence  of  actual  evidence  of  attacks coupled with the expansion of the information collection and security apparatus of governments  leads  to  a  distinct  conclusion:  cyberterror  is  a  social  construction  Furedi,  2005;  Yar,  2013 .  Specifically,  the  threat  posed  by  terrorism  is  built  up  by media and seized upon by claims makers. The resulting public support may be used as  a  means  to  gain  greater  control  over  resources  like  the  Internet  and  impose restrictions  and  surveillance  on  user  activity.  This  position  is  supported  by  the recent revelations regarding the US National Security Agency’s access to email and phone records, as well as a larger global surveillance mechanism  discussed later in this chapter .  This  is  a  challenging  position,  as  the  general  public  does  not  gain  access  to information on attacks against government systems and critical infrastructure. The classification of information makes it difficult to know the reality of terrorist group capabilities or their use of cyber-attacks  Denning, 2010 . At the same time, there has been a massive build-up in security spending and resource allocation to government agencies for what are otherwise extremely rare events  Yar, 2013 . In the end, it is necessary  to  consider  this  position  and  ask,  “What  is  the  correct  balance  between national security and citizens’ rights?”  411   Cyberwar and the nation-state  As  cyberspace  plays  an  increasingly  critical  role  in  managing  the  everyday  aspects  of communication  and  critical  infrastructure,  governments  and  military  agencies  are increasingly attempting to establish their role in cyberspace. Many industrialized nations recognize  the  threat  that  cyber-attacks  can  pose  to  military  and  governmental infrastructure. Some consider cyberspace to be a new warfare domain just like land, sea, air,  and  space   Andress  and  Winterfeld,  2011 .  As  a  consequence,  it  is  necessary  to consider how fighting a war in this domain may operate and what constitutes an act of cyberwar.  There is no single agreed-upon definition for warfare, even among the United Nations. The  historical  literature  on  war  and  warfare  tactics,  however,  suggests  that  it  may  be viewed as an act of force or violence which compels the opponent to fulfill the will of the victor  Andress and Winterfeld, 2011; Brenner, 2008; Schwartau, 1996 . When applied to cyberspace, the use of war tactics appears designed to control and affect the activities of an  opposing  force.  Brenner  defined  cyberwarfare  as  nation-states’  “use  of  military operations by virtual means [.] to achieve essentially the same ends they pursue through the  use  of  conventional  military  force”   2008:  65 .  Thus,  the  domain  of  conflict  for cyberwar  is  different  from  traditional  conflicts  in  that  the  operations  take  place  in  a virtual space  Rid, 2013 .  The weapons of cyberwar are also different from those of traditional combat, in that actors  may  utilize  malware  and  hacking  techniques  in  order  to  affect  system functionality, access to information, or critical infrastructure  Rid, 2013 . The outcomes and goals of cyberwar, however, are similar to physical war in that fighters may attempt either targeted tactical strikes against a specific target or try to cause as much damage as possible to the operational capacity of a nation-state.  Although there has been some debate about the actual threat of cyberwarfare and the utility  of  this  term  generally   see  Andress  and  Winterfeld,  2011;  Rid,  2013 ,  we  must recognize why it may be a fruitful environment for attack. Nearly all critical systems in modern industrialized nations depend on the Internet for commercial or logistic support. For example, water and sewage treatment plants, nuclear, hydroelectric, and other power grids  are  dependent  on  the  Internet  for  command  and  control.  Virtually  all  facets  of banking,  stock  exchanges,  and  economic  systems  are  run  through  the  Internet.  Even aspects  of  the  military  and  related  defense  contractors  of  the  world  are  run  through civilian  or  commercial  telephony.  Any  attack  that  could  effectively  disrupt  the communications  capacity  of  the  Internet  could  effectively  cripple  our  society,  which would have ripple effects throughout the real world. At the same time, the sensitive data maintained by government or military agencies could be compromised and  or stolen in order  to  gain  an  economic  or  defensive  advantage.  Thus,  hacking  sensitive  systems  412   would be an easy and immediate way to affect an enemy through cyberwarfare.  Over the past ten years, there have been an increasing number of incidents that might practically  be  viewed  as  cyberwar.  A  key  example  is  the  conflict  between  Russia  and Estonia  in  2007.  A  conflict  developed  between  Russian  and  Estonian  factions  in  April 2007  when  the  Estonian  government  removed  a  Russian  war  monument  from  a memorial garden in a national cemetery  Brenner, 2008; Jaffe, 2006; Landler and Markoff, 2007 . The statue, called The Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, was installed as a monument to the Russian involvement in World War II, and was viewed as a relic from Estonia’s time as part of the former Soviet Union. Now that Estonia was its own independent nation, the government felt it appropriate to have the statue removed  Guadagno, Cialdini, and Evron,  2010 .  Russian  citizens  living  in  Estonia  and  elsewhere  were  enraged  by  this action, leading to protests and violence in the streets of both countries. Over 1,300 were arrested  during  protests  in  Estonia,  many  of  whom  were  ethnic  Russians  living  in  the country.  The conflict quickly grew into online spaces, with hackers in both Estonia and Russia attempting to engage in different hacks and spam campaigns  Brenner, 2008; Jaffe, 2006 . Russian hackers also leveraged online forums and hacker sites in order to rally attackers together to increase the volume of their attacks and used huge botnets of compromised computers for DDoS attacks  Clover, 2009; Davis, 2007 . The attacks incorporated many individuals  who  were  interested  in  attacking  Estonia  out  of  their  love  and  respect  for their  homeland,  many  of  whom  had  little  knowledge  of  computer  hacking.  As  a consequence,  Russian  attacks  were  able  to  shut  down  critical  components  of  Estonia’s financial and government networks, causing significant economic harm to citizens and industry alike  Brenner, 2008; Landler and Markoff, 2007 . The Estonian Parliament and almost every governmental ministry website was affected. In addition, three of the six national news agencies and two of its largest banks also experienced problems  Clover, 2009 . In fact, banks were knocked offline for hours and lost millions of dollars due to DDoS attacks  Landler and Markoff, 2007 .  In  the  wake  of  this  onslaught,  the  Estonian  government  accused  the  Russian government  of  supporting  and  encouraging  these  attacks.  To  date,  there  has  been  no concrete evidence provided to support Russian state sponsorship  Denning, 2010 . Many observers,  however,  have  argued  that  this  incident  is  a  clear  demonstration  of  how nation-states may engage in conflicts in the future. The actors involved may be driven by their own sense of duty to their country or by actual military doctrine. Regardless, the severity of the attacks demonstrates the need to identify how cyber-resources might be affected by conflicts in the real world.  A  more  recent  example  is  the  appearance  of  a  piece  of  malicious  software  called Stuxnet.  This  computer  worm  was  used  in  attacks  against  the  Natanz  uranium enrichment  facility  in  Iran   Clayton,  2010;  Kerr,  Rollins,  and  Theohary,  2010 .  Stuxnet was  designed  to  specifically  compromise  and  harm  computer  systems  in  order  to  gain access to the SCADA systems and related programmable logic controllers  PLCs  inside  413   of  centrifuges  in  these  plants   Clayton,  2010;  Kerr  et  al.,  2010.   Specifically,  the  code would allow the PLC to be given commands remotely by the attacker, while shielding the  actual  behaviors  of  the  centrifuges  from  the  plant’s  SCADA  control  systems.  As  a result, attackers could surreptitiously disrupt the plant’s ability to process uranium and cause confusion among operators and controllers. It is unknown how long the malware was able to operate inside of the facility, though estimates suggest it may have impacted 1,000  of  the  5,000  centrifuges  in  the  plant  and  delayed  the  overall  functionality  of  the nuclear plant by months or even years  Kerr et al., 2010; Sanger, 2012 .  For more information on Stuxnet, go online to:  1.  www.youtube.com watch?v=n7UVyVSDSxY 2.  www.youtube.com watch?v=863SNTqyYto.  Recent  evidence  suggests  that  Stuxnet  was  developed  by  the  USA  under  the  Bush administration as evidence grew regarding the Iranian nuclear program aspirations. The program,  called  Operation  Olympic  Games,  was  proactively  implemented  by  an executive order of President Obama because it was thought that this sort of attack would be more targeted, difficult to detect, and produce fewer civilian casualties or collateral damage  than  a  physical  strike   Sanger,  2012 .  In  addition,  the  use  of  this  code  was thought to have reduced the likelihood of a conventional military strike by Israel which would  have  dangerous  consequences  for  the  region  as  a  whole.  The  USA  has  not acknowledged any of the claims made related to Stuxnet, though its release in the wild has  given  computer  security  professionals  and  hackers  access  to  this  extremely sophisticated malware. The program may serve as a basis for the development of tools in order  to  exploit  or  attack  critical  infrastructure  across  the  globe   Brodscky  and Radvanovsky, 2010; Clayton, 2010 . The US Department of Homeland Security expressed  414   substantial  concern  over  the  use  of  Stuxnet-like  code  in  attacks  against  US  power installations  Zetter, 2011 . Thus, cyber-attacks may be an increasingly common way for nation-states to engage one another to cause harm.  For  information  on  US  cyber  attempts  to  attack  the  North  Korean  missile program,  go  online  to:  www.nytimes.com 2017 03 04 world asia north-korea- missile-program-sabotage.html? hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab- top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0.  Besides overt or covert cyber-attacks, governments are increasingly using cyberspace as  a  platform  to  engage  in  subtle  information  warfare  campaigns  against  various nations.  Information  warfare  involves  the  use  of  information  and  communications technology to gain advantage over an opponent, and may involve multiple strategies to collect  information  from  an  opponent  or  spread  your  own  information   Andress  and Winterfeld,  2011 .  To  that  end,  the  Internet  is  a  critical  resource  used  to  spread  false information, called disinformation, in order to either manipulate or demoralize a nation and  its  populace   Andress  and  Winterfeld,  2011 .  Since  most  people  now  find  news stories online, whether through traditional news media sources or via social media sites like Facebook, governments can leverage this as a resource to engage in campaigns of misinformation or disinformation.  For  instance,  there  is  substantial  evidence  that  the  Russian  government  operates  a “troll  factory”  out  of  St.  Petersburg  where  individuals  are  paid  to  actively  create  and spread false information, whether through social media posts, comments in news stories and videos posted on traditional journalistic outlets, or via websites created by the trolls themselves  see Box 10.9 for details; also Keneally, 2017 . The individuals engaged in this effort are referred to as trolls as a historical reference to individuals who actively seek fights  and  cause  trouble  in  online  platforms.  They  also  operate  covertly  through  false online profiles that attempt to make the user seem like a citizen from a specific place and a true believer in a specific ideology in order to make their arguments more compelling and  believable  to  others   Timberg,  2016 .  In  turn,  trolls  seek  to  turn  average  people against their governments or against their fellow citizens in order to sow mistrust and discontent, and to challenge the ability of a nation to be effectively led.  415   Box 10.9 Inside the Russian troll organization  www.nytimes.com 2015 06 07 magazine the-agency.html.  The Agency  One Russian newspaper put the number of employees at 400, with a budget of at least 20 million rubles  roughly $400,000  a month. During her time in the organization, there were many departments creating content for every popular social network.  This article exposes the existence and operation of “The Agency,” wherein a group of  people  are  paid  to  engage  as  professional  online  trolls  for  the  benefit  of  the Russian government. The depth of their efforts is unparalleled, and affects various nations  in  ways  that  no  one  could  necessarily  appreciate  on  the  surface.  This  is required  reading  to  understand  the  depth  of  the  Russian  information  warfare apparatus.  The Russian troll brigade is thought to have actively engaged in a long campaign of misinformation to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. Throughout the election, there  were  various  news  stories  and  websites  designed  to  spread  deliberately  false information  about  the  Democrat  candidate  Hillary  Clinton  to  diminish  the  perception she  was  fit  to  serve.  These  stories  quickly  took  on  the  moniker  of  fake  news  in  an attempt to delineate their fictitious nature and differentiate it from news from traditional news stories  Timberg, 2016 . Fake news stories, however, were quickly disseminated and shared via social media through professional trolls, which helped reinforce the perceived legitimacy of the story and may have influenced a proportion of voters’ perceptions of each candidate.  Although this was the first demonstrated instance of an attempt to influence the USA, the  troll  brigade  has  engaged  in  a  long-standing  campaign  to  destabilize  European politics in order to increase Russian power within the region  Higgins, 2016 . There have been repeated attempts to influence German voters’ views, as well as the population of Finland  which  directly  borders  Russia.  They  have  also  attempted  to  whitewash  and legitimize the Russian invasion of the Ukraine via fake news, propaganda, and trolling  Higgins, 2016 .  416   The  persistence  and  prevalence  of  false  news  stories,  conspiracy  theories,  and misleading comments online led the EU to create a specialized task force designed with the express purpose of identifying the Russian campaign’s strategies and exposing them to the public  TEPSA, 2017 . The EEAS East StratCom Task Force was created in March 2015  by  the  European  Council  to  provide  information  to  the  European  Union  and  its Member  States  on  the  extent  of  Russian  disinformation  campaigns.  They  now  publish two weekly newsletters. The Disinformation Review publishes every Tuesday to show the  latest  examples  and  trends  in  Russian  trolling   TEPSA,  2017 .  The Disinformation Digest  is  released  every  Friday,  showing  what  the  pro-government  media  outlets  in Russia are saying compared to independent media voices, along with trends in Russian social  media  feeds   TEPSA,  2017 .  These  two  sources  demonstrate  that  information warfare is a real, powerful, insidious, and ultimately challenging form of cyberwarfare for any nation to defeat.

There is some tension in how to sanction hate speech, as nations like the USA protect freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the Constitution. The only real way that speech is limited in this country is through the “imminent danger” test, where one’s  comments  are  unprotected  if  the  speaker  attempts  to  incite  dangerous  or  illegal activities  Abrams, 2012 . Recognizing that the Internet dramatically increases the risk of exposure to hurtful ideas and prospective radicalization of individuals toward violence, the Obama administration began to take steps to combat the problem of domestic and foreign terror and extremist groups without changing existing protections to free speech. The  White  House  released  a  policy  and  strategy  document  in  August  2011  entitled Empowering  Local  Partners  to  Prevent  Violent  Extremism  in  the  United  States.  This document  detailed  their  desire  to  use  a  community-based  approach  to  reduce  the problem  of  extremist  groups  and  violent  behavior  through  the  integration  of  law enforcement  and  public–private  partnerships  with  stakeholders  in  local  communities  White  House,  2011b .  It  was  argued  that  religious  leaders  in  mosques  and  Islamic centers  of  worship,  as  well  as  schools  and  community  groups,  should  be  brought together in order to foster trust between community residents, law enforcement, and the federal  government.  In  fact,  this  strategy  involved  multiple  federal  agencies  ranging from  the  Treasury,  Department  of  Defense,  Department  of  Justice,  Department  of Homeland Security, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  White House, 2011b . The hope was that these inter-agency and community partnerships could better improve the scope of engagement with communities on issues that they were concerned about, and develop  better  partnerships  that  would  make  communities  resilient  to  radicalization, whether from online groups or those in the real world.  The USA is unique with regard to its equal protection of free speech, as many nations around the world have criminalized hate speech in some form. The UK’s Public Order Act 1986 criminalized expressions of threats, abusive, or insulting behavior to any group of  persons  based  on  their  race,  color,  ethnicity,  nationality,  or  ethnic  origin  with  a punishment of up to seven years in prison and or a fine  Mendel, 2012 . This law was amended in 2006 to include religious hatred and again in 2008 for protection of sexual orientations  Mendel, 2012 . Similar legislation is present in Australia, Canada, Denmark, France,  Germany,  the  Netherlands,  Singapore,  and  South  Africa   Mendel,  2012 . Although  these  statutes  do  not  primarily  identify  the  Internet  as  a  venue  for  the communication of hate speech, the laws can be extended to these environments.  The European Convention on Cybercrime also includes language criminalizing the use of the Internet in order to disseminate hate speech. Specifically, the CoC identifies “racist  418   and  xenophobic  material,”  including  writing,  images,  videos,  and  any  other  content designed  to  promote  or  encourage  hate  or  discrimination  against  any  group   Brenner, 2011 . The distribution or posting of such material online is defined as criminal under the CoC,  as  is  making  online  threats  to  any  person  on  the  basis  of  their  racial,  ethnic,  or religious  background,  and  the  distribution  of  information  that  denies  or  otherwise attempts  to  misinform  individuals  regarding  genocide  and  crimes  against  humanity  Brenner,  2011 .  This  legislation  has  tremendous  value  in  addressing  the  development and  radicalization  of  individuals  through  the  Internet,  particularly  white  supremacist movements.  In  addition  to  hate  speech,  many  of  the  examples  provided  throughout  this  chapter reflect the use of hacking techniques in furtherance of terror or extremist group plots. As a result, several nations have extended their laws pertaining to computer hacking so that they may be applied to these offenses  see Chapter 3 for more details . For instance, one of the few nations to specifically use the language of cyberterror in their legislation is India, which amended its Information Technology Act, 2000 to recognize cyberterror as:  1.  1  When an individual with intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security, or  sovereignty of India or strike terror in the people by:  a.  Denial of access to a computer resource b.  Penetrating  or  accessing  a  computer  resource  either  without  authorization or exceeding authorized access  c.  Introducing  or  causing  the  introduction  of  a  computer  contaminant  e.g. malware  that may cause injury to persons or death, damage or destruction  of  property,  or  adversely  affect  critical  information infrastructure  d.  Accessing  a  computer  resource  without  authorization  or  exceeding access to obtain information, data, or a database that is restricted due to  state  security  concerns  in  order  to  cause  injury  to  the  State,  its security, or relationships with other nations.  Anyone either found guilty of engaging in these behaviors or conspiring to commit them may be imprisoned for life.  The  USA  expanded  the  Computer  Fraud  and  Abuse  Act  following  the  9 11  attacks through  the  introduction  and  passing  of  the  Uniting  and  Strengthening  America  by Providing  Appropriate  Tools  Required  to  Intercept  and  Obstruct  Terrorism   USA PATRIOT  Act of 2001. This Act strengthened the existing CFAA laws to include any computer in the world so long as it is “used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce  or  communications  of  the  United  States”   Brenner,  2011 .  This  provision enables US law enforcement to engage in investigations in foreign countries, so long as the  investigation  is  recognized  as  legitimate  by  that  nation.  In  addition,  the  PATRIOT Act modified the law to also include any unauthorized access to a computer or network  419   that:  1.  modifies or impairs access to medical data; 2.  causes physical injury to a person; 3.  poses a threat to public health or safety; 4.  damages  a  computer  used  by  a  government  entity  in  the  administration  of  justice, national defense, or national security.  Although this language does not specifically recognize cyberterror, the expansion of the statute enabled greater latitude for federal law enforcement to pursue cybercriminals and more effectively prosecute those who would target either critical infrastructure or sensitive data sources that could cause significant harm in the real world.  In  addition,  the  PATRIOT  Act  also  relaxed  the  legal  provisions  needed  for  law enforcement  agencies  to  engage  in  the  surveillance  of  electronic  communications.  For instance,  the  Act  revised  provisions  of  the  Electronic  Communications  Privacy  Act  ECPA   related  to  subpoenas  of  ISPs  and  cable  companies.  The  Act  enabled  law enforcement to obtain the names and addresses of subscribers, along with their billing records,  phone  numbers  called,  duration  of  sessions  while  online,  services  used, communication  device  information,  and  other  related  data.  The  release  of  such information can enable law enforcement to more effectively trace the activities of a user to specific websites and content during a given session of Internet use. In addition, the ECPA now defines email that is stored on a third-party server for more than 180 days to be legally viewed as abandoned. As a result, law enforcement can request that this data and the content of the email, whether opened or unopened, be turned over without the need  for  judicial  review.  Finally,  the  PATRIOT  Act  allowed  ISPs  to  make  emergency disclosures of information to law enforcement in instances of extreme physical or virtual threats  to  public  safety.  Such  language  allows  for  greater  surreptitious  surveillance  of citizens with minimal government oversight or public awareness.  At  the  state  level,  there  is  generally  little  legislation  that  exists  with  regard  to cyberterrorism. Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and West Virginia all have  statutes  that  relate  directly  or  indirectly  to  cyberterrorism   Brenner,  2011 .  For example, Arkansas recognizes an act of terror as any act or series of two  or  more  acts that  attempt  to  disable  or  destroy  data,  computers,  or  computer  networks  used  by industry,  government,  or  contractors.  Connecticut  more  narrowly  defines  an  act  of “computer crime furtherance of terrorist purposes” as an attempt to use computer crimes in order to intimidate or coerce either the government or civilian populations. Georgia has  criminalized  the  use  of  a  computer  in  order  to  disseminate  information  related  to terrorist activities  Brenner, 2011 . The lack of state-based legislation may stem from the recognition  that  an  act  of  terror,  whether  virtual  or  real,  will  more  immediately  fall under the investigative responsibility of the federal government. At the same time, the presence  of  such  legislation  suggests  that  these  states  are  progressive  in  their  thinking about these issues and may serve as models for other states across the country.  420   Other nations have adopted similar language to that of the US PATRIOT Act, such as Canada’s  Anti-terrorism  Act  of  2001,  which  changed  standards  for  the  interception  of domestic communications of all kinds  Brenner, 2011 . For instance, this law allows the Communications Security Establishment of Canada  an analog to the NSA  to intercept communications that either begin or end in Canada and involve a foreign source. Prior to  this  law,  any  domestic  information  acquired  in  the  process  of  an  international intercept  would  have  been  destroyed  or  ignored.  Although  there  has  been  substantive public debate surrounding the legitimacy of these new laws, the Canadian government has not moved to strike them down. Similar legislation in Australia and New Zealand has, however, been repealed due to the perception that they are too extreme and degrade public trust in government  Rid, 2013 .  421   Investigating and securing cyberspace from the threat of terror and war  Over  the  past  decade,  governments  around  the  world  have  been  making  strides  to improve  their  nation’s  cybersecurity  posture.  In  the  USA,  President  Obama’s Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative  CNCI  was adopted in May 2009 in order to strengthen America’s digital infrastructure  White House, 2011a . This involved three main goals to secure the USA from cyberthreats:  1.  Establish  a  front  line  of  defense  against  immediate  threats  and  a  response  capability through federal and local partnerships.  2.  Defend against the full spectrum of threats. 3.  Strengthen  the  future  cybersecurity  environment  through  education  and  research.  This  plan  involved  long-range  strategic  planning  and  development  in  order  to effectively develop an integrated response to cyber-threats. To that end, the CNCI had to achieve 12 major initiatives over the following decade  White House, 2011a :  1.  Move towards managing a single federal enterprise network. 2.  Deploy intrinsic detection systems. 3.  Develop and deploy intrusion prevention tools. 4.  Review and potentially redirect research and funding. 5.  Connect current government cyber operations centers. 6.  Develop a government-wide cyber intelligence plan. 7.  Increase the security of classified networks. 8.  Expand cyber education. 9.  Define enduring leap-ahead technologies. 10.  Define enduring deterrent technologies and programs. 11.  Develop multi-pronged approaches to supply chain risk management. 12.  Define the role of cybersecurity in private sector domains.  Some of these steps are more easily achieved than others  White House, 2011a . For instance,  there  is  now  a  White  House  cybersecurity  advisor  who  provides  direct guidance  to  the  President  on  cyber-threats  and  security  issues.  In  addition,  the government  is  developing  an  intrusion  detection  and  prevention  system  referred  to  as “EINSTEIN”  in  order  to  help  reduce  the  success  of  any  attack  against  government systems.  In  addition,  the  National  Security  Agency   NSA   has  begun  to  develop  a  massive data center in Utah in order to improve the cybersecurity response of the nation. This  422   center,  called  the  Community  Comprehensive  National  Cybersecurity  Initiative  Data Center,  is  designed  to  process,  aggregate,  and  verify  threats  across  DoD  and  federal cyberspace   Fidel,  2011 .  As  a  result,  there  is  some  evidence  that  this  plan  is  actually taking shape in the real world.  The scope of NSA data collection was recently and dramatically brought to light by the whistle-blowing efforts of a former contractor named Edward Snowden. He revealed the  existence  of  multiple  programs  designed  to  capture  and  mine  sensitive  data  from various electronic data sources around the world, including the PRISM program  Gidda, 2013 . The NSA implemented this program in 2007 to collect email and other electronic communications  data  of  all  sorts,  and  it  was  carried  out  through  cooperative relationships  with  various  technology  companies,  including  Apple,  Facebook,  Google, Microsoft,  and  Skype   Gidda,  2013 .  In  turn,  this  data  could  be  mined  and  queried  for intelligence-generation purposes to assess terror threats and networks of actors, as well as  identify  tactical  and  strategic  information.  News  of  this  program  drew  tremendous outrage from various governments, particularly Germany and Brazil  Gidda, 2013 . The United Kingdom, however, indicated that it received access to PRISM data and used this source in addition to its own surveillance and data-collection programs  Gidda, 2013 . It is  unclear  how  such  data-collection  programs  will  change  or  adapt  with  changing attitudes toward the Internet and data privacy generally, though it will continue to be a core issue for national security.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation  As noted earlier, the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  plays a critical role in the investigation  of  both  traditional  crimes  and  cybercrimes.  In  fact,  the  investigation  of terror  attacks  and  foreign  intelligence  operations  is  among  the  top  priorities  of  the Bureau.  The  National  Security  Branch   NSB   of  the  FBI  is  designated  with  the  task  of gathering  intelligence  and  coordinating  investigative  efforts  to  disrupt  terrorist  groups and foreign intelligence groups  FBI, 2017 . The NSB was established in 2005 as the result of a presidential directive to combine the mission and resources of the counterterrorism, counterintelligence,  and  intelligence  mission  of  the  Bureau  under  a  single  unit.  This branch  includes  five  components:   1   the  FBI’s  National  Joint  Terrorism  Task  Force, which manages over 100 FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, shares intelligence, and works cooperatively on terrorism investigations;  2  the Counterintelligence Division deals with traditional and non-traditional espionage and intelligence gathering in the USA;  3  the Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction  Directorate   WMDD   designed  to  reduce  the  threat  and proliferation  of  nuclear,  biological,  and  chemical  weapons;   4   the  Terrorist  Screening Center,  which  generates  actionable  intelligence  for  state  and  local  law  enforcement agencies  and  maintains  the  consolidated  Terrorist  Watchlist;  and   5   the  High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group that actively collects information from terror suspects in order to gain information to deter attacks against various targets  FBI, 2017 . Thus, the  423   NSB plays a critical role in both law enforcement, homeland security, as well as in the intelligence community generally.  For information on the recent DOJ indictment of two Russian spies allegedly responsible  to: www.cnn.com 2017 03 14 politics justice-yahoo-hack-russia index.html.  Yahoo   online   hacks,   for   go   The Department of Energy  While most generally think of law enforcement agencies with regard to the investigation of  crime  and  terror  threats,  other  government  agencies  play  an  increasingly  pertinent role  in  this  space.  For  instance,  the  US  Department of Energy  DOE   plays  a  critical role in the maintenance and protection of energy programs and production generally. As our  energy  infrastructure  is  becoming  dependent  on  the  Internet  and  computer technology  for  operation  and  management,  the  threat  of  external  attacks  and compromise  has  increased  dramatically   Department  of  Energy,  2013 .  Thus  the  DOE operates  the  Office  of  Intelligence  and  Counterintelligence  in  order  to  generate intelligence on various threats to our energy infrastructure, as well as those of foreign governments and nations. In addition, the Office of the Chief Information Officer at the DOE supports various resources to communicate information on cybersecurity threats to national  security  in  general   Department  of  Energy,  2013 .  They  support  computer security protocols for DOE employees and techniques to secure various resources from external threats.  The  DOE  also  operates  an  Incident  Management  Program,  coordinated  with  US- CERT, to respond to various cyber-threats. This includes reporting incidents, generating security bulletins for vulnerabilities in various desktop and SCADA systems, as well as incident response management and tracking  Department of Energy, 2013 .  The Department of Homeland Security  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security   DHS   is  a  cabinet-level  department  which consolidated  various  federal  agencies  under  a  single  department  heading.  Created  in  424   2001  following  the  September  11  attacks,  the  DHS  handles  civilian  infrastructure  and populations within the borders of the USA  DHS, 2016 . Their mission includes a variety of  agencies  focused  on  traditional  physical  resources,  such  as  Customs  and  Border Protection and finance through the Secret Service, though the cybersecurity role of the DHS  has  expanded  over  the  past  decade.  In  fact,  the  DHS  now  operates  the  Office  of Cybersecurity  and  Communications,  which  plays  multiple  roles  in  coordinating cybersecurity strategies, along with communications in the event of major emergencies and disasters  DHS, 2016 .  One  of  the  key  components  under  this  Office  is  the  National  Cyberse-curity  and Communications Integration Center  NCCIC , which opened on October 30, 2009  DHS, 2016 . The NCCIC’s mission is to minimize the likelihood of successful attacks against both  critical  information  technology  and  communications  networks.  The  NCCIC  also serves  to  connect  multiple  government  organizations  together  in  order  to  protect computer systems and networked infrastructure in general. It also plays a role in linking the public and private sectors together in order to help promote information sharing and improve the state of cybersecurity through awareness of emerging threats.  For  more  on  the  organizational  structure  of  the  US  DHS,  go  online  to: www.dhs.gov organizational-chart.  The Center consists of four branches to secure all aspects of the nation’s information technology  infrastructure   DHS,  2016 .  The  first  is  the  US-Computer  Emergency Readiness  Team,  or  US-CERT,  which  serves  as  a  response  center  and  information clearinghouse  for  cyber-threats  across  the  world   DHS,  2016 .  The  CERT  provides reporting mechanisms for vulnerabilities and threats to systems, as well as security tools to help patch and protect systems from attack  DHS, 2016 . The CERT can also serve to analyze  and  track  threats  as  they  evolve  for  virtually  any  branch  of  government  and civilian  networks  through  the  National  Cybersecurity  Protection  System   NCPS    DHS 2016 .  The  NCCIC  also  houses  the  Industrial  Control  Systems  Cyber  Emergency  Response Team  ICS-CERT , which plays a similar function to the US-CERT, but focuses solely on control  systems  used  in  critical  infrastructure  and  systems,  such  as  water  and  energy providers.  The  ICS-CERT  can  also  provide  incident  response  operations  to  restore  425   services and analyze attacks. They also serve as a key point of communication between the  private  and  public  sector  to  share  information  on  control  system-related  threats  DHS, 2016 .  The National Coordinating Center for Communications  NCC  serves as the hub for any  efforts  to  either  restore  or  initiate  telecommunications  services  and  facilities  on behalf of National Security and Emergency Preparedness. Finally, the NCCIC Operations and  Integration  branch   NO&I   serves  as  the  hub  for  planning,  coordinating,  and integrating all capabilities across the NCCIC  DHS, 2016 .  Other  nations  use  similar  mechanisms  to  secure  various  infrastructures  from  cyber- threats. For instance, the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure  CPNI  in  the  UK  exists  to  inform  critical  infrastructure  owners  of  emerging  threats  and coordinate  responses  in  the  event  of  a  compromise   CPNI,  2014 .  Similarly,  Australia now has the Critical Infrastructure Center which was founded on January 23, 2017 to coordinate  the  response  to  threats  to  the  nation  and  its  territories  against  the  various systems and networks  AGAGD, 2017 .  426   Cyberwar and response  Although  law  enforcement  has  general  oversight  over  cybercrimes  and  incidents  of terror, the military has exclusive response to acts that may be defined as cyberwar, such as attempts to compromise DoD networks or those of related defense contractors. To that end,  the  Pentagon  established  the  US  Cyber  Command   USCYBERCOM   in  2009  in order to manage the defense of US cyberspace and critical infrastructure against attacks  Andress  and  Winter-feld,  2011 .  The  new  Cyber  Command  is  a  sub-command  of  the United States Strategic Command  USSTRATCOM , which has responsibility over space, information  operations,  intelligence,  nuclear  arms,  and  combating  weapons  of  mass destruction.  This  is  sensible  given  the  fact  that  cyberspace  is  an  overarching environment that cuts across all branches of military service. This command focuses on DoD  networks  only,  while  all  civilian  aspects  of  cyberspace  are  managed  by  the Department of Homeland Security.  In addition, the Department of Defense is now placing a specific emphasis on the need for  careful  responses  to  theft  of  data,  destructive  attacks  to  degrade  network functionality,  and  denial-of-service  attacks,  due  to  the  direct  threat  they  pose  to  the communications  capabilities  of  the  nation,  as  well  as  the  maintenance  of  secrecy  and intellectual property  Department of Defense, 2011 . In order to reduce the risks posed by malicious  actors  and  attacks,  the  report  calls  for  improved  relationships  with  private industry in order to develop an improved total government response and an expanded workforce focusing on cybersecurity.  In  addition  to  the  DoD,  the  NSA  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  protection  and investigation of attacks against sensitive military networks  NSA, 2013 . The NSA serves as a key resource in both data encryption and protection of nearly all federal government computer  networks.  They  also  investigate  attacks  against  computer  networks  from nation-state  and  non-nation-state  actors  alike   NSA,  2013 .  Finally,  they  play  a  critical role  in  intelligence  gathering  of  foreign  nations’  cyber  infrastructure  in  order  to  map vulnerabilities and develop offensive cyber strategies  see Box 10.10 for examples of tools developed  by  the  NSA .  The  NSA  combines  agents  with  skills  in  computer  science, engineering,  mathematics,  and  linguistics  in  order  to  better  investigate  various  issues related to cybersecurity threats. Similar agencies are present in various nations, such as Australia’s  Defence  Signals  Directorate   DSD ,  Canada’s  Communications  Security Establishment   CSE ,  New  Zealand’s  Government  Communications  Security  Bureau  GCSB , and the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters  GCHQ .  Box 10.10 The tools created by the NSA for espionage  and attack  427   https:  medium.com @botherder everything-we-know-of-nsa-and-five-eyes- malware-e8eac172d3b5.cw0vpzc84.  Everything we know of NSA and Five Eyes Malware  After  years  of  publications,  and  even  a  massive  commercial  speculation  [.]  it  comes  to  no  surprise  that Western  governments  are  also  engaged  in  malware  attacks.  However,  we  still  know  very  little  on  their capabilities and sophistication.  This article provides an overview of all the malware and tools that were disclosed by Edward  Snowden  in  the  large  dump  of  NSA  documents  he  made  available  to reporters.  This  analysis  details  myriad  programs  used  for  both  active  surveillance and cyber-attacks. The scope of tools and the systems they compromise is extremely surprising  and  demonstrates  the  technical  sophistication  of  some  of  the  programs used to various ends in the wild.  The development of USCYBERCOM emerged around the same time as those of other similar command infrastructures across the world. For instance, Australia established the Cyber Security Operations Centre  CSOC  in 2009 as a coordinated response to cyber- attacks against government systems. Canada, France, Japan, and the UK have established similar  agencies  in  order  to  help  defend  against  attacks.  The  Chinese  government  has established both offensive and defensive military organizations housed within so-called Information  Warfare  Militia  Units,  Technical  Reconnaissance  Bureaus   TRBs ,  and  the General Staff Department  GSD; Andress and Winterfeld, 2011 . At the same time, these forces may be augmented by the larger population of active hackers operating within the bounds  of  the  nation  with  or  without  state  sponsorship.  The  Russian  government  also has  cyberwarfare  capabilities  which  are  housed  within  the  Federal  Security  Service  of the Russian Federation, the Federal Guard Service, and the General Staff  Andress and Winterfeld, 2011 . Even North Korea has established units in order to support cyberwar, though  the  lack  of  information  about  the  nation  makes  it  difficult  to  assess  their  true functionality   Andress  and  Winterfeld,  2011 .  Incidents  like  the  Sony  Pictures Entertainment  hack,  if  truly  performed  by  North  Korea,  would  suggest  they  have substantive capabilities that must not be taken lightly.  428   Summary  This  chapter  demonstrates  the  complex  and  very  real  threat  posed  by  acts  of  online extremism  and  cyberterrorism,  including  the  application  of  hacking  techniques  in furtherance of war between nation-states. These threats require a sophisticated response from  law  enforcement  and  military  agencies  alike  in  order  to  properly  defend  against attacks. At the same time, it may not be immediately clear when an attack is motivated by an extremist agenda or when it is simply criminal. Thus, the problem of cybercrime, hacktivism,  and  cyberterror  will  involve  investigative  resources  and  initiatives  to determine the origins of an attack and the actors responsible. This issue will continue to evolve along with technology adoption and use across the globe. Hopefully, however, we will not experience an electronic Pearl Harbor incident in the years to come.

How should we define or view the activities of Anonymous? They hack government targets, civilians, and industry. As such, should their actions be viewed as cybercrime, hacktivism, or cyberterror? Why?  2.  What  real-world  events,  whether  political,  military,  or  social,  could trigger a cyber-attack? For instance, why were there not more virtual sit- ins or DDoS attacks in response to the PRISM program?  3.  Why do you think incidents like the Sony Pictures Hack or the Russian trolling operations do not lead to more substantial policy responses from the USA? Is it too difficult to find an appropriate response? What do you think would be acceptable?  4.  The threat of nuclear war and the proliferation of WMD are deterred in part  by  the  idea  of  mutually  assured  destruction,  not  only  for  the  two nations  but  for  the  larger  world.  Given  that  nearly  every  nation  has economic  and  critical  infrastructure  dependent  on  technology,  if  a nation-state were to engage in cyberwar against a rival, it would demand a physical or cyber response. With that in mind, how can nation-states deter the use of cyber-attacks against one another? How do we respond to  attacks  committed  by  hackers  or  nation-states  which  are  not  430   influenced by traditional deterrence methods?  431   Available at: www.archive.org stream 39WaysToServeAndParticipate 39WaysToServeAndParticipateInJihad_djvu.txt  References  Abrams, F.  2012 .

Assess  the  usefulness  of  specific  criminological  theories,  such  as  social learning theory and the general theory of crime, in explaining a variety of cybercrimes.     Compare  a  situational  theory  of  victimization  with  an  individual-level  explanation to understand cybercrime victimization.    Explore whether new cybercrime theories are necessary.  439   Introduction  Over the past several decades, scholars have debated how cybercrime offending differs from  traditional  crime.  The  first  ten  chapters  of  this  text  discuss  how  the  reasons  or motivations  for  cybercrime  offending  are  typically  the  same  as  those  for  traditional offending. Financial incentive is a substantial motive for some hackers, malware writers, and  virtually  all  fraudsters.  Individuals  who  download  legal  and  illegal  pornography enjoy the easy access to material that satisfies their sexual desires. Online harassment, similar to traditional bullying, allows someone to hurt others and therefore have power over them from a distance. There is also the thrill and rush associated with harassing and swindling  others,  downloading  pornography,  and  breaking  into  a  computer  system. Thus, Grabosky’s  2001: 243–244  comment seems apt:  Computer crimes are driven by time-honoured motivations, the most obvious of which are greed, lust, power, revenge, adventure, and the desire to take “forbidden fruit.” None of the above motivations is new. The element of novelty resides in the unprecedented capacity of technology to facilitate acting on these motivations.  As a result, cybercrime may be viewed as “old wine in a new bottle”  Grabosky, 2001; Wall,  1998 .  If  this  is  the  case,  traditional  criminological  theories  should  have  no difficulty in explaining cybercrime if it is simply “old wine.”  The  previous  chapters,  however,  illustrated  that  there  is  something  unique  about cybercrime that separates it from traditional criminal activity. Although it may be the same “old wine,” there are instances of “new wine,” such as malware creation, that have little connection to the physical world. The second part of this analogy, the new bottle, is also pertinent in that virtual space is different than physical space. The Internet allows easy access to most people around the world, and provides an avenue for individuals to engage  in  cybercrime  while  feeling  largely  anonymous.  The  Internet  also  allows  the offender, whether an individual, group, or nation-state, to avoid making physical contact with the victim or his or her property. Thus, cybercrime may not be viewed as “old wine in new bottles” or even “new wine in new bottles,” but “rather many of its characteristics are  so  novel  that  the  expression  ‘new  wine,  but  no  bottles!’  becomes  a  more  fitting description”  Wall, 1998: 202 .  In  addition,  examining  the  uniqueness  of  cybercrime  may  allow  us  to  better understand  more  about  these  phenomena  as  well  as  provide  brand  new  insights  into traditional  forms  of  crime   Holt  and  Bossler,  2016 .  Discussions  of  new  cyber-specific criminological  theories  may  be  a  catalyst  for  additional  theoretical  creation  and elaboration.  Taken  as  a  whole,  this  chapter  will  show  that  the  future  of  cybercrime research is bright. Studies which elaborate complex associations that have been held in the traditional literature for decades will also provide new insights into the commission of crime – both traditional and cyber related.  Unlike  traditional  criminological  textbooks  that  place  theories  into  categories   e.g.,  440   classical, positivist, etc. , and then cover each theory in chronological order, our focus is on how criminological theories have been applied to cybercrime. Thus, we focus on the theories that have been examined the most and have therefore provided the most insight into  why  individuals  commit  or  do  not  commit  these  offenses.  Considering  that  a subcultural framework has been used extensively through this text, we begin first with a discussion  of  subcultural  research  on  cybercrime;  readers  should  consider  the information  they  read  in  the  first  ten  chapters  for  more  details.  The  two  strongest competing theories for explaining cybercrime based on empirical support – Ron Akers’  1998   social  learning  theory  and  Gottfredson  and  Hirschi’s   1990   general  theory  of crime  –  will  be  discussed.  The  chapter  then  progresses  to  cover  theories  that  have recently  been  receiving  more  attention  in  the  cybercrime  literature,  but  still  have  not received the same level of focus as social learning theory and the general theory of crime –  Agnew’s  general  strain  theory,  techniques  of  neutralization,  and  deterrence  theory. Two  victimization  theories  that  have  been  used  to  better  understand  cybercrime victimization  –  routine  activity  theory,  a  situational  theory  of  victimization,  and  the general theory of crime, an individual-level theory – are then described and assessed. We finally conclude with a discussion of how a traditional criminological theory has been modified to better understand cybercrime: digital drift theory.  441   Subcultural theories  Overview  Most  criminological  theories  focus  on  offending  as  a  consequence  of  individual-level factors  that  may  be  affected  through  properly  targeted  intervention  strategies.  These theories, however, do not explore the meaning offending has for some individuals and the  depth  of  their  participation  in  peer  networks  that  may  facilitate  criminal  activity. Researchers who explore criminality through a subcultural lens can provide substantive depth on the how and why of criminal behavior  Miller, 1958; Short, 1968 .  Defined from a broad perspective, a subculture  is  any  group  having  certain  values, norms, traditions, and rituals that set them apart from the dominant culture  Kornblum, 1997; Brake, 1980 . Subcultures form as a response to either a rejection of the dominant culture  Miller, 1958  or around a distinct phenomenon that may not be valued by the larger society  Quinn and Forsyth, 2005; Wolfgang and Ferracuti, 1967 . This includes an emphasis  on  performing  certain  behaviors  or  developing  skill  sets   Maurer,  1981   and learning the rules or codes of conduct that structure how individuals view and interact with different groups  Foster, 1990 . Subcultures also use special terms and slang, called an argot.  They  may  also  have  some  outward  symbols  of  membership  like  tattoos  or informal  uniforms   Maurer,  1981 .  Thus,  demonstrating  such  knowledge  illustrates  an individual’s reputation, status, and adherence to a particular subculture.  In  many  ways,  subcultural  frameworks  share  common  elements  of  social  learning theory  Akers, 1998 , since involvement in a subculture influences behavior by providing individuals with beliefs, goals, and values that approve of and justify particular types of activities,  including  crime   Herbert,  1998 .  In  fact,  the  transmission  of  subcultural knowledge increases the likelihood of involvement in criminal behavior despite potential legal  consequences  for  these  actions   Miller,  1958;  Short,  1968 .  As  such,  subcultural frameworks  provide  an  important  perspective  to  explain  how  the  values  and  ideas espoused by members of a group affect the behavior of its members.  Subcultures and cybercrime  The development of the Internet and computer technology has had a dramatic impact on the  formation  of  and  participation  in  deviant  or  criminal  subcultures   DiMarco  and DiMarco,  2003;  Quinn  and  Forsyth,  2005;  Holt  and  Bossler,  2016 .  The  anonymity  and distributed  nature  of  the  Internet  enables  individuals  to  connect  to  groups  that  share similar  likes,  dislikes,  behaviors,  opinions,  and  values,  regardless  of  the  participants’ locations in the real world  DiMarco and DiMarco, 2003 . Some individuals may not be  442   able  to  discuss  their  interests  or  activities  with  others  in  the  real  world  due  to  fear  of legal reprisal or concerns that others around them may reject them because they do not share their interests.  Technology  allows  individuals  to  connect  to  others  without  these  fears,  and  even provide  information  about  a  behavior  or  activity  to  improve  their  knowledge  and minimize fear of detection  Blevins and Holt, 2009; Holt, 2007; Quinn and Forsyth, 2005 . Individuals  can  readily  communicate  subcultural  knowledge  through  email  and  other forms  of  CMC   Holt,  Soles,  and  Leslie,  2008;  Holt  and  Copes,  2010 .  In  turn,  this information  can  increase  the  likelihood  of  success  when  engaging  in  illicit  behavior despite  potential  legal  consequences.  Thus,  the  value  of  the  Internet  and  CMCs  for individuals across the globe is pivotal in the pursuit of crime and deviance online and offline.  Throughout  this  textbook,  we  have  used  the  subcultural  framework  extensively  to describe  those  individuals  who  participate  in  a  certain  activity,  as  well  as  the  beliefs, structures,  and  interactions  that  provide  support  to  them  in  opposition  to  community norms and standards that have defined them and their behavior in many cases as deviant or  criminal.  In  Chapter  3,  we  explored  the  hacker  subculture,  devoid  of  Hollywood portrayals,  and  its  primary  norms  of  technology,  knowledge,  learning,  and  secrecy, regardless  of  the  individual’s  involvement  in  malicious  hacking.  Chapter  4  described how the interests and beliefs of malware writers are generally congruent with those of the  larger  hacker  subculture.  In  Chapters  7  and  8,  we  discussed  how  the  Internet  has allowed individuals with deviant sexual orientations to interact with one another, gain validation for their sexual desires, exchange both materials and beliefs, and be part of a community.  Finally,  Chapter  10  examined  the  ways  in  which  the  Internet  provides  a means for extremist groups to indoctrinate individuals in favor of their movement.  Technology enables individuals to be introduced to core principles and norms of the group  while  allowing  them  to  interact  with  members  from  a  safe  physical  distance. Future  cybercrime  scholars  will  continue  to  find  this  framework  fruitful  in  explaining how group dynamics affect individuals’ belief systems and participation in cyber-deviant acts.

Arguably  the  second  most  important  predictor  is  whether  that  person  has  friends  or associates who engage in crime and delinquency  Pratt et al.,  2009 .  This  link  between peer  behavior  and  offending  has  been  the  source  of  a  substantial  amount  of  both research and theory aimed at explaining this relationship.  In 1947, Edwin Sutherland presented in his book, Principles of Criminology, one of the first  theories  to  explain  the  peer-offending  relationship:  differential  association  theory  Sutherland,  1947 .  Sutherland  argued  that  criminal  behavior  was  learned  in  a  process involving  interactions  and  communication  with  others,  with  the  most  important interactions stemming from intimate personal groups. During this process, an individual not only learned techniques on how to commit crimes, but also motives, rationalizations, and  attitudes  that  supported  the  violation  of  the  law.  A  person  became  more  likely  to commit  delinquent  or  criminal  acts  when  his  or  her  “definitions,”  referring  to rationalizations and attitudes, which supported the violation of the law exceeded those that  were  unfavorable  to  breaking  the  law.  Criticisms  over  the  years,  however,  have centered heavily on the theory’s:  1  testability, and  2  lack of specificity on the learning process  mechanisms  responsible  for  the  commission  of  deviant  and  criminal  behavior  Kornhauser, 1978; Matsueda, 1988 .  Since the 1960s, Ron Akers has reformulated differential association theory to specify the  learning  mechanisms  through  which  criminal  behavior  is  learned.  In  what  has become  known  as  social  learning  theory,  Akers   1998   expanded  upon  Sutherland’s original differential association theory by introducing principal components of operant conditioning, namely that behavior followed by rewards or reinforcements will be more likely to continue, while acts followed by punishment will be less likely  Akers, 1998 . Thus,  Akers’   1998   social  learning  theory  argued  that  the  learning  process  of  any behavior,  including  crime,  includes  four  principal  components:   1   differential association,  2  definitions,  3  differential reinforcement, and  4  imitation.  This  dynamic  learning  process  begins  by  associating  with  others,  both  deviants  and non-deviants.  Differential  associations  to  deviants  provide  both  models  for  deviant behavior and definitions, such as attitudes and norms, which may favor breaking the law or  providing  justifications  that  neutralize  possible  negative  consequences  of  deviance. Following Sutherland’s differential association theory, social learning theory holds that individuals who have a greater proportion of beliefs supportive of deviant behavior will be more likely to engage in those activities.  445   Although definitions supporting criminal activity are critical to the offender to justify their  behavior,  criminality  will  occur  if  it  is  reinforced  through  some  means,  whether social or financial. For example, an individual who perceives that he will receive praise from his friends for throwing a rock through a window will be more likely to throw the rock. If that praise comes, he will be more likely to continue this behavior in the future. Perceived or actual punishments, however, will decrease the likelihood of that behavior. The  punishments  may  take  the  form  of  adding  negative  stimuli,  such  as  spanking  or arresting, or in the removal of positive stimuli, such as taking away television privileges. Finally,  imitation  plays  a  major  role  in  the  social  learning  process,  as  individuals  may engage in deviant behavior after watching someone else engage in the same behavior. Imitation plays a larger role in the earlier stages of the learning process. As the process continues, however, definitions and differential reinforcements become more important. Social learning theory has been one of the most commonly tested criminological theories and  has  arguably  received  the  strongest  empirical  support  to  date  in  its  favor  for explaining  a  wide  variety  of  behaviors   Akers  and  Jensen,  2006;  Lee,  Akers,  and  Borg, 2004; Pratt et al., 2009 .  Social learning theory and cybercrime  Given the support which Akers’  1998  theory has in the larger research community, it is no  surprise  that  scholars  have  seen  its  potential  importance  in  explaining  why individuals  commit  cybercrime.  The  complexities  of  computer  programming  make  the connection between learning and cybercrime quite apparent. Depending on the specific cybercrime, individuals must “learn not only how to operate a highly technical piece of equipment  but  also  specific  procedures,  programming,  and  techniques  for  using  the computer  illegally”   Skinner  and  Fream,  1997:  498 .  Even  though  computer  technology has  become  more  user  friendly  due  to  convenient  interfaces,  there  is  a  need  for  a learning  process  in  which  the  basic  dynamics  of  computer  use  and  abuse  are  learned from others.  Digital piracy  see Chapter 5  does not seem overly complex at first. Someone simply downloads  a  music  or  movie  file  without  authorization.  Social  learning  theory  would hold  that  in  order  for  individuals  to  commit  digital  piracy,  they  must  participate  in  a social  learning  process.  The  individual  must  interact  with  fellow  digital  pirates,  learn how  and  where  to  perform  downloads,  imitate  what  they  have  observed,  learn definitions  supportive  of  the  violation  of  intellectual  property  laws,  and  be  rewarded either financially or socially for their efforts in order for the piracy to continue.  Virtually  every  study  examining  digital  piracy  finds  that  associating  with  pirating peers, regardless of whether the interaction is face-to-face  Higgins and Marcum, 2011; Hinduja and Ingram, 2008, Holt, Bossler, and May, 2012  or virtual  Miller and Morris, 2016 ,  is  the  most  significant  correlate  in  predicting  pirating  behaviors.  Friends  and intimate  relationships  can  provide  information  on  the  methods  required  to  engage  in  446   piracy and the location of materials on the Internet. Piracy requires some technological skill  which  may  be  garnered  through  direct  associations  with  others.  The  continuous technological  developments  noted  in  this  community  also  require  peer  associations  in order to readily identify new mechanisms to download files. Individuals are then able to engage in simple forms of piracy through imitation  Hinduja, 2003; Holt and Copes, 2010; Holt, Burruss, and Bossler, 2010; Ingram and Hinduja, 2008; Skinner and Fream, 1997 . As pirating  becomes  easier  for  an  individual,  the  need  for  these  delinquent  associations could decrease. Furthermore, positive reinforcement for participation in software piracy is evident through both financial  i.e., free movies and music  and social  i.e., praise for showing someone how to use torrent sharing software  rewards  Hinduja, 2003; Holt and Copes, 2010 .  Studies have also shown that pirates have both definitions that favor the violation of intellectual property laws and techniques of neutralization that diminish their personal responsibility  for  their  actions   Brown,  2016;  Higgins  and  Marcum,  2011;  Ingram  and Hinduja,  2008;  Skinner  and  Fream,  1997 .  Members  of  the  piracy  subculture  espouse attitudes that minimize the impact of copyright law and the harms caused by pirating media. For instance, individuals who pirate materials commonly justify their actions by suggesting that downloading a few songs or media does not actually harm the property owners or artists  Brown, 2016; Higgins and Marcum, 2011; Ingram and Hinduja, 2008 . Pirates also believe that their actions are not inherently wrong, since there are no clear guidelines  for  ethical  behavior  in  online  environments   Higgins  and  Marcum,  2011; Ingram and Hinduja, 2008 . These attitudes are often communicated among pirates and encourage further participation in piracy over time.  In much the same way, social learning theorists argue that individuals who engage in computer  hacking  would  need  to  associate  with  individuals  who  hack.  These relationships  should  increase  their  likelihood  to  imitate  hacking  activity  early  in  their development  as  a  hacker  as  well  as  be  exposed  to  definitions  favorable  to  using technology in this fashion. As they participate further in the hacker subculture, hacking would be socially reinforced, possibly even financially, and the behavior would continue. Studies have shown that all four social learning components are empirically related to hacking behaviors  Bossler and Burruss, 2011; Skinner and Fream, 1997 . The importance of  peer  associations  in  influencing  hacking  behavior  is  not  only  found  in  qualitative studies and anecdotal stories, but has also been consistently found to be one of the most important  predictors  of  hacking  behavior  in  quantitative  studies   Bossler  and  Burruss, 2011; Holt et al ., 2012; Skinner and Fream, 1997 . Morris and Blackburn  2009  found that college  students  associating  with  delinquent  youth  had  a  larger  impact  upon  more serious forms of computer crime, such as attempted hacking, malicious file damage, or manipulation,  than  their  attitudes.  Delinquent  peer  associations  have  been  empirically shown to be important in providing models to imitate  e.g. Morris and Blackburn, 2009  as well as in the introduction and acquisition of beliefs and excuses to justify computer attacks  Bossler and Burruss, 2011; Skinner and Fream, 1997 . Similar to the arguments that  the  hacker  subculture  provides  positive  social  encouragement  and  praise  for  447   successful and innovative hacks, scholars testing social learning hypotheses have found similar results  Bossler and Burruss, 2011; Skinner and Fream, 1997 . Skinner and Fream  1997  found that teacher encouragement, as well as participation in electronic bulletin boards, increased the likelihood of students guessing passwords.  As discussed in Chapter 3, websites and chatrooms can play a large role in the social learning  process  of  hackers.  Box  11.1  displays  an  article  that  summarizes  different websites where individuals can learn basic ethical hacking skills.  Box 11.1 Examples of websites that provide information  on hacking techniques  www.compsmag.com top-best-websites-learn-ethical-hacking .  Top 10 best websites to learn ethical hacking, 2017  Hacking isn’t an individual subject that anyone can pick up overnight. This can’t be accomplished after reading one article and visiting a few of these websites – the phrase is used to indicate that in time and with a lot of practice, you’ll be able to [.] hack like a pro.  This article provides an overview of ten key websites that can help individuals learn to hack ethically. There is inherent value in this article because it demonstrates that information on hacking may be acquired through virtual venues with a great deal of ease and engender the learning process in meaningful ways.  Although scholars have examined how the Internet has been used by terrorist groups, few have used criminological theory to understand why individuals join these groups or how  they  are  influenced  by  them.  A  rare  exception  is  Freiburger  and  Crane’s   2011  study applying social learning theory to online extremism in which they argue that “by applying  these  four  constructs  [differential  association,  definitions,  differential reinforcement,  and  imitation]  to  terrorists’  uses  of  the  Internet,  researchers  can  better understand how the Internet is being used to enhance terrorist operations”  p. 128 .  Terrorist groups have clearly been able to use the Internet to increase membership by gaining access to youth around the world  differential association  and communicating beliefs   definitions   that  support  terrorist  activities.  Freiburger  and  Crane   2011   argue  448   that  second-generation  youth  living  in  new  countries  are  especially  vulnerable,  since they are dealing with their lack of identity, unemployment, and feelings of isolation and discrimination.  Within  online  support  systems,  however,  they  find  and  communicate with others who are in similar situations. The Internet has become more important for terrorist  groups  to  find  and  indoctrinate  members,  making  contact  in  physical  space unnecessary.  The  Internet  is  valuable  in  that  it  is  accessible  at  any  time  and  in  most  places. Depending on the severity of the individual’s sense of isolation and lack of attachment to conforming groups, online associations with extremists and potential terror groups may provide a vital sense of meaning and connection for a disenfranchised youth. As their feelings  intensify  and  they  participate  more  often  in  online  discussions,  they  will  be more  prone  to  accept  the  definitions  favoring  the  particular  ideological  message promulgated  on  these  websites.  In  addition,  the  Internet  provides  strong  positive reinforcement in that it can make terrorists into instant celebrities, martyrs for the cause, and  can  glorify  them  long  after  they  have  died.  These  reinforcements  provide  the perception  to  youth  that  the  glory,  not  to  mention  increases  in  self-esteem  and  self- identity, stemming from violence and harm greatly outweigh the negative consequences. Finally,  the  information  and  videos  posted  online  provide  simple  steps  for  someone  to follow and imitate  Freiburger and Crane, 2011 .  As the above paragraphs demonstrate, Akers’  1998  social learning theory is not just one of the most theoretically and empirically sound theories to account for traditional forms of crime, but it also applies equally as well to a wide variety of both simple and more complex forms of cybercrime.  449   General theory of crime  Overview  Unlike  most  traditional  criminological  theories  that  focus  on  examining  why  people commit crime, social control theories ask the opposite question: “What causes people to actually conform to the rules?” Control theories argue that individuals engage in crime as a function of our basic human nature, and the desire to obtain the rewards that crime can  bring,  whether  economic  or  emotional.  They  argue  that  motivation  is  generally invariant among all individuals, meaning that no one person is any more motivated to commit  a  crime  than  another.  What  separates  criminals  from  non-criminals  is  the amount  of  control  placed  upon  the  individual,  whether  by  the  law,  society,  school, family,  friends,  oneself,  or  other  institutions  and  groups.  Criminals  simply  have  less control placed upon them, making them more free to pursue their pleasures through the most efficient means, which is quite often illegal.  Over the past two decades, the most popular, parsimonious, and highly tested social control  theory  developed  has  been  Michael  Gottfredson  and  Travis  Hirschi’s   1990  general  theory  of  crime.  The  theorists  argue  that  most  crimes  are  relatively  simple actions that provide immediate gratification. Based on the characteristics of most crimes, Gottfredson  and  Hirschi  argue  that  offenders  have  certain  behavioral  and  attitudinal characteristics, including being impulsive, insensitive, and giving little consideration to the  future.  Since  they  act  on  the  spur  of  the  moment,  they  give  little  thought  to  the consequences  of  their  actions.  The  lack  of  forethought  and  other  behavioral characteristics  lead  them  to  fail  in  school,  have  poor  relationships  with  others,  and engage  in  risky  behaviors  in  which  the  long-term  consequences  outweigh  the  meager short-term benefits, such as smoking, drug use, and unprotected sex. Taken as a whole, Gottfredson  and  Hirschi   1990   argue  that  criminal  behavior  and  other  risky  activities stem  from  one’s  level  of  self-control,  or  the  ability  to  constrain  one’s  own  behavior through  internal  regulation.  Adequate  levels  of  self-control  are  primarily  formed  in childhood  through  proper  parental  child-rearing  techniques,  including  monitoring, recognizing  inappropriate  behavior. Although  the  theory  may  seem  simplistic,  low  self-control  has  been  one  of  the  more consistent correlates of crime  Pratt and Cullen, 2000  and has been consistently linked to a wide range of crime and deviance.  inappropriate  behavior,  and  punishing  that   The general theory of crime and cybercrime  The  general  theory  of  crime  has  frequently  been  applied  to  cybercrime  since  it  is  a  450   general theory, meaning that it should be able to explain any form of crime. Self-control theorists argue that most forms of cybercrime are similar to those of traditional crime: they are simple in nature, can be performed with little to no skill, and will lead to long- term  consequences  that  are  greater  than  short-term  benefits.  Thus,  the  reason  why people commit cybercrime is the same reason why people steal, hit, rob, burglarize, and sell drugs – inadequate levels of self-control.  Empirical  research  consistently  supports  the  argument  that  low  self-control  is  a significant predictor in understanding why people commit a wide variety of cybercrimes and cyberdeviance, including, but not limited to: online harassment  Holt et al., 2012; Li, Holt,  Bossler,  and  May,  2016 ,  downloading  online  pornography   Buzzell,  Foss,  and Middleton, 2006 , digital piracy  Higgins and Marcum, 2011 , and online economic crimes  Moon, McCluskey, and McCluskey, 2010 . Individuals with low levels of self-control are more likely to harass, bully, or stalk others online due to both their inability to control their  temper  and  their  inclination  to  “solve”  problems  physically  rather  than  mentally  Holt, Bossler, and May, 2012; Li et al ., 2016 . Individuals who are impulsive and focus on easy and simple immediate gratification are more likely to view and download online pornography   Buzzell  et al.,  2006;  Holt  et al.,  2012 .  Digital  piracy,  whether  involving software,  music,  or  movies,  is  considered  a  simple  task  that  requires  minimal  skill, provides immediate gratification with almost no effort, and indicates little empathy for the  owners  of  the  intellectual  property   Higgins  and  Marcum,  2011 .  In  addition, individuals with low self-control are more likely to commit identity theft  Moon et al., 2010 , simply viewing online economic crime to be a simple and easy way to make quick cash to support immediate wants.  There is some potential that more complicated forms of cybercrime, such as computer hacking,  may  not  be  accounted  for  through  the  general  theory  of  crime.  Self-control theorists  would  argue  that  computer  hacking  is  simplistic  and  that  hackers  are  just taking advantage of easy opportunities. They would also expect hackers to have some of the  same  characteristics  of  “traditional”  criminals,  including:  impulsivity;  lacking diligence; not focusing on long-term goals; not being cognitive; self-centered and non- empathetic;  and  becoming  easily  frustrated.  Research  provides  some  support  for  this idea,  though  there  are  major  inconsistencies  as  well   Bossler  and  Burruss,  2011 .  Both traditional  criminals  and  computer  hackers  illustrate  a  lack  of  empathy  with  their victims  Turgeman-Goldschmidt, 2005 . In addition, hackers often state that they engage in hacking activities because of the thrill or rush of the hack  Schell and Dodge, 2002 . They also enjoy the adventure of exploring what new technology can do.  Much  of  what  is  known  about  sophisticated  hacks  and  malware  development, however, suggests that hackers have higher levels of self-control. They can typically be cognitive  and  verbal,  as  demonstrated  by  their  strong  commitment  to  and  mastery  of technology  Holt, 2007; Schell and Dodge, 2002 . Many hackers are also enrolled in high school college or employed, sometimes in the security field, all indicating some interest in long-term goals  Bachmann, 2010; Holt, 2007; Schell and Dodge, 2002 . The potential disparity between hackers and those who engage in “hacks” makes it difficult to apply  451   the  characteristics  of  low  self-control  to  hacking  in  general.  Hackers  that  may  be considered “script kiddies” seem to have the characteristics of the traditional criminals to which  Gottfredson  and  Hirschi   1990   refer   Holt,  2007 .  They  fulfill  their  immediate gratification  by  using  simple  techniques,  like  downloading  others’  programs,  shoulder surfing,  brute-force  attacks,  and  social  engineering,  that  do  not  require  any  deep knowledge  of  technology  or  much  time  and  effort   Holt  and  Kilger,  2012 .  More advanced forms of computer hacking, such as the creation of malicious software, require a much greater amount of technical proficiency as well as time and energy to perfect the program – concepts incongruent with low self-control  Bossler and Burruss, 2011; Holt and Kilger, 2012 .  Empirical  tests  support  the  complex  relationship  between  low  self-control  and computer  hacking.  Holt  and  colleagues   2012   found  that  low  self-control  predicted computer hacking, specifically accessing another’s computer account of files without his or her knowledge or permission, in a sample of youth. Holt and Kilger  2008 , however, found that hackers “in the wild” had similar higher levels of self-control compared to a sample  of  college  students  in  information  security  courses.  Bossler  and  Burruss   2011  also  found  that  in  a  college  sample,  youth  who  committed  three  types  of  hacking behaviors  guessing another person’s password into his or her computer account or files; accessing  another’s  computer  account  or  files  without  his  or  her  knowledge  or permission  to  look  at  information;  and  adding,  deleting,  changing,  or  printing  any information  in  another’s  files  without  permission   and  did  not  partake  in  the  social learning process needed higher levels of self-control in order to be able to figure out how to hack. Individuals with lower levels of self-control were more likely to be involved in a social learning process which connected them with peers who taught them methods of hacking  and  reinforced  the  value  of  these  activities   Bossler  and  Burruss,  2011 .  Self- control had a larger influence on hacking via its indirect effect on hacking through the social learning process than its direct effect on hacking. In simpler terms, one may argue that lower levels of self-control were more related to computer hacking generally.  Bossler  and  Burruss   2011   considered  this  “partial  support”  at  best  for  the  general theory of crime’s ability to explain computer hacking. The lack of general research on this  issue,  however,  leads  to  a  fundamental  and  basic  question:  Is  computer  hacking  a simple activity that can be explained by one important concept such as low self-control, or  is  it  a  more  complex  activity  that  requires  being  involved  in  a  long-term  social learning  process  that  requires  peers  teaching  and  reinforcing  behaviors?  The  current body of research suggests that both answers are correct. Simple hacking techniques, such as brute-force attacks  see Chapter 3 , require little skill and may be explained by both low self-control and social learning, though the influence of the social learning process on hacking is always stronger than the effect of low self-control. At the same time, more complex  forms  of  hacking  require  accruing  advanced  skills  through  a  social  learning process and or on their own as a result of higher levels of self-control.  In the end, there is no denying the importance of low self-control in understanding the commission of cybercrime. These studies indicate that self-control may predict crime  452   in  the  cyberworld  as  well  as  it  does  in  the  terrestrial  world.  In  addition,  research  also shows  that  the  influence  of  delinquent  peer  associations  is  a  stronger  predictor  of cybercrime  than  levels  of  self-control   Holt  and  Bossler,  2014,  2016 .  Thus,  the  general theory of crime and social learning must be discussed together in some respects rather than treated separately.

Merton’s original  version  of  strain  theory  posited  that  being  unable  to  achieve  the  goal  of economic  achievement  leads  to  a  sense  of  frustration.  To  deal  with  this  strain, individuals need to find other ways to satisfy their needs which may include criminal activity.  In  Agnew’s  version,  he  discusses  the  role  of  frustrations  leading  to  negative emotions,  such  as  anger,  frustration,  and  depression,  which,  if  not  addressed appropriately, can lead individuals to engage in crime as a response.  Agnew  1992  identified three primary categories of strain that can have a substantive impact upon emotional states:  1  the threatened or actual failure to achieve positively valued  goals;   2   threatened  or  actual  removal  of  positively  valued  stimuli;  and   3  threatened or actual presentation of noxious stimuli. In simpler terms, not achieving a goal   e.g.,  not  landing  the  job  you  wanted,  failing  a  test ,  having  something  positive taken  away   e.g.,  loss  of  a  parent  or  loved  one ,  or  experiencing  something  bad   e.g., bullying, family conflict  can all lead to negative emotions such as frustration or anger. These  central  arguments  have  received  sound  empirical  support  since  the  theory’s inception.  Life  strains  significantly  influence  involvement  in  delinquency   Agnew  and White, 1992; Broidy, 2001; Paternoster and Mazerolle, 1994 , though this relationship is mediated  by  increased  levels  of  negative  emotions,  particularly  anger  and  frustration  Brezina,  1998;  Mazerolle  and  Piquero,  1997 .  Those  who  experience  greater  negative emotions are more likely to respond to strain with delinquency and crime.  General strain theory and cybercrime  Almost all scholars who have applied general strain theory to cybercrime have chosen to examine  cyberbullying.  This  is  sensible,  given  that  the  virtual  environment  allows individuals to immediately and easily vent frustration and anger at others in a detached way that does not require direct interaction with their victim  see Chapter 9 .  Thus,  it would make sense for it to also apply well to explaining why some individuals choose to cyberbully  others.  Another  reason  is  that  in  Agnew’s   2001   significant  elaboration  of general strain theory, he identified bullying as a strain that was particularly relevant for explaining delinquency. He specifically provided four conditions that bullying satisfies to cause strain:  1  the victim will perceive the bullying as unjust;  2  it will be perceived as being high in magnitude or importance because of the vitality of peer relationships for  454   youth;  3  the bullying will be occurring away from traditional forms of social control such as parents or teachers; and  4  the victim will be exposed to aggressive behavior in order to model his or her own future behavior.  The empirical research to date has supported this application of general strain theory  see Box 11.2 . Young people, who are more likely to experience a wide variety of strains, including poor school performance, perceived unfair sanctions from teachers or parents for conduct, and the experience of negative life events, are more likely to participate in bullying behaviors online and offline  Moon, Hwang, and McCluskey, 2011; Paez, 2016; Patchin and Hinduja, 2011 .  Box 11.2 Understanding the consequences of  cyberbullying  https:  nobullying.com consequences-of-cyberbullying .  This  link  demonstrates  the  substantive  emotional  harms  that  individuals  can experience as a result of cyberbullying. The impact of this experience can be wide- ranging  and  may  be  sufficient  to  lead  an  individual  to  feel  anger  and  frustration over a long period of time, which ties in with Agnew’s general strain theory.  Cyberbullying victimization, however, may also be viewed as a strain on its own that may lead to delinquent behavior  Baker and Pelfrey, 2016; Hinduja and Patchin, 2007 . In Hay, Meldrum, and Mann’s  2010  study consisting of middle and high school students, they found that both traditional and cyberbullying victimization significantly increased future  offending  as  well  as  self-harm  and  suicidal  ideation.  In  fact,  cyberbullying victimization had modestly larger effects than physical bullying victimization on future offending.  The  victims  were  more  likely,  however,  to  self-harm  or  to  have  suicidal thoughts than to engage in harm against others. Wright and Li  2013  found that both peer  rejection  and  cyberbullying  victimization  predicted  future  online  aggression  even when controlling for past acts of cyber aggression. In addition, being cyberbullied led to more  aggression  when  coupled  with  peer  rejection   Wright  and  Li,  2013   and  physical bullying  Wright and Li, 2012 . Baker and Pelfrey  2016  found in a sample of middle and high school students that experiencing cyberbullying and feeling unsafe at or traveling to and from school were significantly related to both soft and hard drug use as well as  455   carrying weapons.  Although general strain theory has shown itself to be a relevant theory for explaining traditional forms of crime as well as cyberbullying, the extent to which it will apply to other  forms  of  cybercrime  has  yet  to  be  fully  examined   Holt  and  Bossler,  2016 . Although  its  propositions  are  not  strongly  connected  to  property-driven  cybercrime, such as digital piracy, its tenets marry well with the often predatory nature of computer hacking.  General  strain  theory  provides  interesting  propositions  on  why  individuals would commit computer hacks. For instance, there may be certain life events, whether being  fired,  failing  in  school,  or  losing  a  boyfriend  or  girlfriend,  that  may  lead individuals to experience negative emotions. Experiencing anger, resentment, frustration, or possibly depression may all be pertinent triggers that could lead someone to lash out and  attempt  to  harm  others  by  attacking  their  systems   for  examples,  see  Rege,  2013 . More  advanced  examinations  of  general  strain  theory  could  consider  whether involvement in political or ideologically driven hacks, like those of Anonymous, could stem  from  individual  perceptions  of  how  technology  and  information  is  used  in  our society.  Coupled  with  anger  or  frustration,  this  may  affect  involvement  in  illegal computer intrusions to address their perception of the problem. Only future research can address  how  general  strain  theory  may  apply  to  forms  of  cybercrime  other  than cyberbullying.  456   Techniques of neutralization  Overview  Gresham  Sykes  and  David  Matza’s   1957  techniques of neutralization  focus  on  how beliefs affect the process of deciding to commit a delinquent or criminal act. This theory assumes that most people hold conforming beliefs, but may still occasionally engage in criminal  behavior.  Delinquents  and  criminals  develop  neutralizations  prior  to committing the act to justify why the behavior was acceptable and not in conflict with their  general  belief  system.  This  allows  them  to  drift  between  criminality  and conformity without accepting a deviant or criminal identity  Matza, 1964 . Unlike social learning  theory,  which  would  argue  that  the  criminal  offender  had  more  beliefs supporting breaking the law than conforming beliefs, techniques of neutralization argue that  the  offender  maintains  a  conventional  belief  system  and  can  justify  deviant behavior.  Sykes and Matza  1957  developed five basic techniques that allow individuals to break from conformity:  1  denial of responsibility: someone else, event, or situation will be directly  responsible  for  the  offense  and  should  be  blamed;   2  denial of an injury:  no one  or  thing  will  get  hurt  or  damaged;   3   denial  of  a  victim:  there  is  no  discernible victim   e.g.,  large  corporation   or  the  “victim”  deserved  it;   4   condemnation  of  the condemners: those who would condemn their actions are hypocritical and doing so out of personal spite; and  5  appeal to higher loyalties: the offense is for the greater good of the group. One can summarize these five techniques with the following statements:  1  “It wasn’t my fault”;  2  “No big deal. Nothing really happened”;  3  “They deserved it”;  4  “You would have done the same thing”; and  5  “My friends needed my help.”  Techniques of neutralization and cybercrime  Scholars have applied the techniques of neutralization to a range of cybercrimes in order to  understand  how  these  behaviors  can  be  justified  by  individuals  who  live  primarily conforming lifestyles and hold value systems congruent with those of traditional society. Most  of  the  research  focus  has  been  on  digital  piracy,  particularly  in  college  samples, arguing  that  students  hold  justifications  that  allow  them  to  download  music  or  media without believing themselves to be criminals. Quantitative analyses of piracy have found weak  Hinduja, 2007  to moderate support  Higgins, Wolfe, and Marcum, 2008; Ingram and  Hinduja,  2008;  Marcum,  Higgins,  Wolfe,  and  Ricketts,  2011;  Morris  and  Higgins, 2009  for the acceptance of various beliefs that justify this behavior. Scholars who have interviewed digital pirates have found stronger support for techniques of neutralization  457    Holt  and  Copes,  2010 ,  which  may  be  due  to  the  nature  of  interviews  allowing  the respondents to express their feelings clearly, rather than giving preselected responses to a given question. Holt and Copes  2010 , for example, found that persistent pirates do not see themselves as part of some piracy subculture, but simply that they have beliefs that justify these actions.  Ulsperger,  Hodges,  and  Paul   2010   performed  one  of  the  most  intensive  qualitative examinations of music piracy using a sample of youth born in “Generation Y” between 1982 and 1992. The authors found that the most prevalent technique supported among this group was denial of responsibility, at 36 percent of all sampled. Individuals in the sample  placed  the  blame  for  their  pirating  behaviors  on  the  mere  existence  of  the Internet, time constraints to go to the store, economic disadvantage, being underage and not being allowed to purchase the music, and the simplicity of downloading music. The second  most  common  technique  was  condemning  the  condemners,  with  students focusing  their  attention  on  the  fact  that  it  seems  that  everyone  does  it,  governmental apathy in addressing downloading music, and the record industry’s need to refocus its energies on something else. Fifteen percent denied that there was a victim and thought that  the  music  industry  was  greedy,  CDs  were  too  expensive,  and  corporations  were exploiting  customers.  Another  15  percent  denied  that  an  injury  even  occurred.  They argued  that  there  was  no  moral  harm,  music  is  not  a  tangible  product,  they  were previewing  it  for  later  purchase,  and  that  they  were  informally  promoting  the  artist. Finally,  they  also  appealed  to  higher  loyalties  than  the  law  and  the  music  industry, including their friendships, freedom, God’s gift of music, free trade, and environmental concerns.  Scholars  have  also  found  that  hackers  use  a  variety  of  techniques  as  well  to  justify their actions, as documented in Chapter 3  see also Box 11.3 .  Many  hackers  deny  that any injury occurred by arguing that either their computer exploits do not actually cause any  harm   Gordon  and  Ma,  2003   or  that  gaining  unauthorized  access  to  computer systems  is  not  very  serious  in  comparison  to  other  illegal  acts   Chua  and  Holt,  2016 . Others  blame  victims  for  having  inadequate  computer  skills  or  computer  systems  to prevent  the  victimization   Chua  and  Holt,  2016;  Jordan  and  Taylor,  1998;  Turgeman- Goldschmidt, 2005 . Hackers may also appeal to higher loyalties by stating that they are helping  society  by  exposing  corruption  or  providing  knowledge  freely  to  society   see Chapter 3; also Chua and Holt, 2016 . They may also argue that the victim had it coming or that large corporations are greedy and do not really need the additional profits that their hacking prevented.  In Morris’s  2011  insightful study examining the justifications hackers frequently use, he found that neutralizations help us understand password guessing and illegal access to a  computer  system  specifically,  but  not  for  file  manipulation.  He  also  found  that associating with delinquent peers was a significant predictor of computer hacking over and  above  individual  beliefs  and  agreement  with  techniques  of  neutralization.  He therefore summarized that the techniques of neutralization are complementary to other theories, but not necessarily a standalone theory.  458   Box 11.3 Justifications for hacking  http:  debatewise.org debates 3452-hacking-can-be-justified .  With the possibility of cyber warfare and concerns over hacks that result in huge amounts of information being stolen getting more widespread white hat hackers are becoming more necessary to ensure security. Can such attacks be justified?  This  article  provides  a  robust  and  informed  debate  on  the  ways  in  which  hackers may be able to justify their involvement in serious attacks. The article provides good insights  from  both  the  perspective  of  hackers  and  of  infrastructure  owners  and governments that may be harmed.  Finally,  Copes  and  Vieraitis’   2009   study  on  how  traditional  identity  thieves  use techniques of neutralization is insightful for understanding online economic crime, even if  their  sample  did  not  include  online  identity  thieves.  The  identity  thieves  stated  that they would not engage in just any type of crime; they would not physically hurt others for money, as this was perceived to be morally wrong. They most frequently used:  1  denial  of  injury,   2   denial  of  victim,   3   appeal  to  higher  loyalties,  and   4   denial  of responsibility when justifying their actions. The most common justification used by the identity thieves is that their actions did not cause any real harm to actual individuals. Most losses were minor and victims resolved the problems with a few quick phone calls. If  the  thief  acknowledged  that  a  victim  existed,  they  cited  large  organizations  that deserve victimization because of their unethical business practices. Thus, they not only denied these organizations victim status, but also “condemned the condemners”  Sykes and Matza, 1957 .  The identity thieves also justified their crimes by stating that they were trying to help others  i.e., appeal to higher loyalties  by obtaining money. Their efforts could provide a better life for their children or give confidential information or government documents to family members and friends. In these cases, they did not normally think their actions were ethical, but that the needs of their families and friends were more important in the decision-making  process.  Finally,  many  of  the  identity  thieves  who  worked  within organizations claimed that they only played a minimal role in the crime, received little reward, and their supervisors in the organizational hierarchy had greater responsibility for the offense.  459   In summary, Sykes and Matza’s  1957  techniques of neutralization provides scholars with a framework to understand various forms of cybercrime, particularly digital piracy, computer  hacking,  and  identity  theft.  Although  quantitative  analyses  usually  only provide  modest  support  for  the  theory’s  propositions,  in-depth  qualitative  interviews provide  much  stronger  evidence.  As  a  result,  neutralization  theory  research  will  likely continue in the future as scholars attempt to identify rationalizations that allow usually conforming individuals to drift temporarily into online criminal behavior.  460   Deterrence theory  Overview  The  Classical  school  of  criminology,  which  dates  back  to  the  mid-eighteenth  century, was the product of the intellectual beliefs of the Enlightenment era. They viewed human beings  as  hedonistic,  rational,  and  calculating.  As  a  result,  crime  was  the  result  of freewill  and  rational  decision  making  by  individuals.  People  weighed  the  benefits  and costs of a possible decision and chose whichever increased pleasure and decreased pain. They  were  not  compelled  to  do  so  by  any  internal   e.g.,  biological   or  external   e.g., demons   forces  beyond  their  control.  In  order  to  minimize  the  possibility  of  crime, society needed structures to convince individuals that crime was neither a profitable nor pleasurable choice. To do this, governments needed to clearly codify laws on what was inappropriate, set punishments that were equal to the pleasure of the crime so that no incentive would exist, apprehend criminals when they broke the law, and punish them swiftly  Paternoster, 1987 .  The  principles  of  deterrence  theory,  generated  by  Cesare  Beccaria,  are  a  direct reflection of the ideas of the Classical school. This perspective argues that human beings will be deterred from choosing to commit crime if they believe that punishment will be certain, swift, and proportionately severe. The certainty of the punishment refers to how likely it is that the individual will be caught and punished for the offense. Swiftness, or celerity, of the punishment refers to how quickly the punishment follows the criminal act,  not  the  apprehension  of  the  offender.  Finally,  the  severity  of  the  punishment involves the intensity of the punishment relative to the harm caused by the crime.  Scholarly research has shown modest support for deterrence theory propositions using a  wide  variety  of  methods,  including  retrospective  accounts,  perceptual  surveys,  and longitudinal assessments  Paternoster, 1987; Pratt et al., 2006; Yu and Liska, 1993 . Studies have  shown  that  certainty,  not  severity,  is  the  most  important  deterrence  component. Increasing the perceived probability of getting caught is more important than increasing the severity of the punishments  e.g., more years in prison, larger fines  associated with the crime.  Deterrence and cybercrime  Based  on  Chapters  2  through  10  of  this  volume,  it  is  clear  that  most  Western  nations based  their  government  structures  and  criminal  justice  systems  on  the  tenets  of  the Classical school. Each chapter has ended with a discussion of the legislation that nations have passed to criminalize certain computer-related behaviors, the specific punishments  461   associated  with  each  offense,  and  the  agencies  that  enforce  violations  of  these  laws. These structures should provide an easily communicated framework to deter would-be cybercriminals  based  on  the  certainty  of  getting  caught  and  receiving  appropriate punishments.  Research  applying  deterrence  theory  to  cybercrime  offending,  however,  is  not  as robust as that of other theories discussed thus far. For example, if digital pirates perceive there to be an increased chance of getting caught and receiving swift and harsh justice, they would theoretically be less likely to take the chance to pirate software, music, or movies.  Bachmann   2007   found  a  temporary  reduction  in  piracy  rates  after  an  anti- piracy campaign was enforced by the RIAA, illustrating that individuals were deterred for  a  short  period  of  time.  The  rate  of  piracy,  however,  began  to  trend  back  up  after several months. As a result, researchers have tried to identify what specific elements of deterrence  appear  to  have  an  influence  on  behavior.  Higgins,  Wilson,  and  Fell   2005  found  that  certainty  of  punishment,  not  severity,  reduced  the  likelihood  of  piracy, supporting deterrence research on traditional criminal offending.  Wolfe, Higgins, and Marcum  2008  examined whether intent to commit digital piracy was influenced by self-imposed guilt, the perception of whether family and friends might find out about the piracy, and the fear of getting a virus through pirated materials. Their results  showed  that  guilt,  an  informal  source  of  punishment,  was  one  of  the  strongest factors preventing individuals from downloading music illegally. The fear of a malware infection  was  not,  however,  significant.  Thus,  it  may  be  that  informal  levels  of  social control, such as guilt and embarrassment, may prove more useful in decreasing digital piracy than legal actions.  Scholars have also examined whether computer hackers can be deterred. In a sample of  college  students,  Skinner  and  Fream   1997   found  that  the  severity  of  punishment associated  with  computer  intrusions  decreased  their  occurrence.  The  certainty  of detection, by either administrators or students, was not significantly related to hacking behavior.  Extending  this  line  of  inquiry  into  the  deterrability  of  hackers,  Maimon,  Alper, Sobesto,  and  Culkier   2014   conducted  an  experiment  to  study  whether  displayed warning  banners  affected  the  progression,  frequency,  and  duration  of  computer intrusions or trespassing. Using a set of live computers connected to the Internet that are designed to be attacked, called honeypots, the authors found that the warning banners did  not  affect  immediate  termination  of  computer  intrusion.  Individuals  who  saw  the warning  banner  were  no  more  likely  to  leave  within  the  first  five  seconds  than  those who  were  not  presented  with  the  banner.  In  addition,  the  warning  banners  did  not reduce the volume of repeated trespassing incidents. The warning banners did, however, shorten  the  duration  of  the  trespassing  incidents   Maimon  et  al  .,  2014 .  In  a  similar study, Wilson et al.  2015  found that the presence of surveillance banners reduced the severity  of  computer  intrusion  attacks,  measured  by  whether  commands  were  entered into  the  system,  but  only  in  longer  first  system  trespassing  events.  Thus,  researchers have  found  modest  support  that  traditional  deterrence  mechanisms  can  deter  hackers  462   from trespassing into university network systems.  Since the Internet allows individuals to attack both end users and government targets, researchers  have  presented  arguments  as  to  how  deterrence  may  be  used  to  prevent cyber-attacks  or  cyberterrorism   e.g.,  Blank,  2001;  Brenner,  2007;  Geers,  2012 .  For example,  Guitton   2012   argued  that  actor  attribution   determining  the  source  of  an attack  can act as a deterrent, but only when the individual had a good knowledge of the attribution process, acted rationally, and was concerned about the costs of punishment. Attribution  will  not,  however,  be  effective  for  irrational  actors  who  do  not  fear punishment,  possibly  because  the  praise  received  from  a  successful  cyber-attack requiring  skill  is  considered  more  important  to  these  individuals.  If  deterrence  only appears to be influential for rational actors, how should nation-states protect themselves from hackers who are more concerned about the perceived benefits of the cyber-attack and  to  make  a  political  statement  regardless  of  the  costs  to  him  or  his  country?  This assumes that a nation can actually identify the source of an intrusion in the first place, which is not always possible  Brenner, 2007 .  Clearly,  more  research  needs  to  be  conducted  on  the  benefits  of  a  deterrence framework  to  understand  various  forms  of  cybercrime.  In  some  instances,  the  lack  of deterrence research regarding cybercrimes appears to have more to do with its testability and  measurement  issues  than  the  logic  of  its  theoretical  arguments.  Thus,  future researchers  may  move  away  from  conducting  surveys  which  have  had  difficulty assessing the theory to more experimental designs.  463   Theories of cybercrime victimization  Criminologists  have  not  only  used  traditional  criminological  theories  to  better understand  why  some  individuals  are  more  likely  to  commit  various  forms  of cybercrime, but also what factors place individuals at risk for cybercrime victimization. The two most common theories used to assess the likelihood of cybercrime victimization are  Lawrence  Cohen  and  Marcus  Felson’s   1979  routine activity theory  and  Michael Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi’s  1990  general theory of crime.  Routine activity theory  Cohen and Felson  1979  argued that direct contact predatory victimization occurs with the convergence in both space and time of three primary components:  1  a motivated offender,   2   a  suitable  target,  and   3   the  absence  of  a  capable  guardian.  If  one component is missing, crime will not occur, making this an ideal theory to examine how offender and victim interactions may be artificially affected to reduce crime. Motivated offenders constitute any individuals or groups who have both the inclination and ability to  commit  crime.  Cohen  and  Felson  assumed  that  there  would  always  be  an  ample supply of motivated offenders. Thus, they were more interested in how social  e.g., more women  joining  the  workforce   and  technological   e.g.,  lighter  electronics   changes affected changes in national crime rates.  A target, whether referring to a person or an object, is viewed as suitable based on how attractive it is to the offender on a wide range of factors, including monetary value, ease of access, and other intrinsic values. Finally, capable guardians exist to protect the target from harm. Guardianship may be expressed in various ways, including physical  e.g.,  security  cameras,  lighting,  alarm  systems,  locks,  etc. ,  social   e.g.,  friends ,  and personal  e.g., knowing martial arts, carrying pepper spray  forms.  Scholars  who  use  routine  activity  theory  are  particularly  interested  in  how  daily behavioral  routines  increase  a  target’s  proximity  to  motivated  offenders  while  also affecting  both  capable  guardianship  and  target  suitability.  Understanding  routine activities is important in that they normally separate individuals from the safety of their homes,  people  they  trust,  and  their  possessions.  Scholars  have  found  this  theory  to  be very successful in predicting a wide variety of both property crime victimization, such as burglary  Cohen and Felson, 1979; Couple and Blake, 2006  and larceny  Mustaine and Tewksbury,  1998 ,  as  well  as  violence,  such  as  physical  assault   Stewart,  Elifson,  and Sterk, 2004  and robbery  Spano and Nagy, 2005 .  Routine activity theory and cybercrime victimization  464   Routine activity theory was identified by early cybercrime scholarship as a key theory to better  understand  cybercrime   Grabosky  and  Smith,  2001;  Newman  and  Clarke,  2003 . Scholars have argued that each component of this theory – motivated offenders, suitable targets, and the absence of a capable guardian – is present in cyberspace. As the previous chapters have indicated, there is an abundance of individuals who have the inclination and ability to harass others, download child pornography, hack into computers, or try to commit  online  fraud.  In  keeping  with  the  spirit  of  routine  activity  theory,  cybercrime scholars who study routine activity theory do not assess motives but rather focus on the factors affecting victimization risk.  The suitability or attractiveness of a target in cyberspace varies substantially based on the interests of the offender. The target may be a computer system or network, sensitive data,  or  an  individual.  For  the  crime  of  computer  intrusion,  a  hacker  may  want  to compromise  a  system  because  he  wants  access  to  specific  information  or  files.  On  the other  hand,  he  may  simply  want  to  see  whether  the  system  can  be  penetrated   Holt, 2007 .  In  incidents  of  harassment,  an  individual  may  be  targeted  for  various  reasons, whether  because  of  a  perceived  slight,  a  failed  relationship,  or  because  of  perceived weakness and social isolation  see Chapter 9 for details .  Finally,  there  are  guardians  in  cyberspace  equivalent  to  the  ones  we  use  to  protect ourselves in the physical world. Computers have various forms of physical guardianship, equivalent  to  locking  our  houses,  such  as  antivirus  software  and  password-protected screens.  Antivirus  and  similar  programs  are  designed  expressly  to  reduce  harm  from hackers  and  other  cybercriminals  who  may  want  access  to  your  sensitive  information  see Chapter 4 . Social guardianship can play a large role in the cyberworld as well, since our friends can protect us from harassment and other forms of victimization or they can be  the  ones  that  harass  us,  unintentionally  send  us  corrupted  files  via  email,  or  teach risky activities such as how to commit digital piracy. Finally, personal guardianship in cyberspace  could  include  developing  an  understanding  of  computer  technology, updating  software,  changing  passwords,  and  not  providing  sensitive  personal information  see Box 11.4 for an example .  Box 11.4 Self-protection while online  www.us-cert.gov ncas tips ST06-003.  Security tip  ST06-003   Staying safe on social network sites  While  the  majority  of  people  using  these  sites  do  not  pose  a  threat,  malicious  people  may  be  drawn  to them  because  of  the  accessibility  and  amount  of  personal  information  that’s  available.  The  more information malicious people have about you, the easier it is for them to take advantage of you.  465   This security bulletin from the US-CERT provides practical information on the ways in which individuals can protect themselves and their personal information in social media sites like Facebook. The article also demonstrates the inherent benefits of self- protection in online environments.  Although  the  components  of  routine  activity  theory  appear  to  apply  to  all  forms  of cybercrime victimization, Majid Yar  2005  expressed concern regarding the applicability of the theory as a whole. He notes that routine activity theory:  requires that targets, offenders and guardians be located in particular places, that measurable relations of spatial proximity  and  distance  pertain  between  those  targets  and  potential  offenders,  and  that  social  activities  be temporally ordered according to rhythms such that each of these agents is either typically present or absent at particular  times.  Consequently,  the  transposability  of  RAT  to  virtual  environments  requires  that  cyberspace exhibit a spatio-temporal ontology [emphasis in original] congruent with that of the “physical world,” i.e. that place, proximity, distance and temporal order be identifiable features of cyberspace.   Yar, 2005: 414   In  essence,  cyberspace  does  not  meet  these  criteria  according  to  Yar  because  virtual environments are spatially and temporally disconnected, disorganized, active at all times, and  web  pages  are  born  and  die  in  relatively  short  amounts  of  time.  Most  scholars, however, view the interaction of the offender and victim in cyberspace through the web or email as analogous to physical interactions  Bossler and Holt, 2009 . Reyns, Henson, and  Fisher   2011   addressed  this  concern  theoretically  with  their  cyberlifestyle-routine activities  theory  which  connects  motivated  offenders  and  victims  through  networked systems. The network between victim and offender allows for both a conduit to exist in cyberspace between the two groups and an eventual overlap in time for the interaction to occur. Other scholars have commented that Yar’s  2005  critique may be applicable to offenses  committed  on  certain  websites,  but  that  computer  networks  associated  with universities,  government  agencies,  and  corporations  are  fairly  stable  and  that  offenses committed against these networks  e.g., computer intrusions  may be more predictable by  online  routine  behaviors  of  the  networks’  users   Maimon  Kamerdze,  Cukier,  and Sobesto, 2013 .  A large body of scholarship has developed which empirically tests the applicability of routine activity theory to cybercrime  Holt and Bossler, 2016; Leukfeldt and Yar, 2016 . Most  of  this  research  has  focused  on  its  ability  to  predict  online  harassment  and cyberstalking  victimization.  The  findings  provide  limited  evidence  that  routine technology  use  affects  the  risk  of  online  harassment  or  cyberstalking  victimization,  466   including spending time in chatrooms, social networking sites, and email  e.g., Bossler, Holt,  and  May,  2012;  Hinduja  and  Patchin,  2009;  Holt  and  Bossler,  2009;  Moore, Guntupalli, and Lee, 2010; Ngo and Paternoster, 2011; Reyns et al., 2011; Ybarra, Mitchell, Finkelhor, and Wolak, 2007; see Hinduja and Patchin, 2008 and Leukfeldt and Yar, 2016 for  exceptions .  Using  a  large  dataset  in  the  Netherlands,  Leukfeldt  and  Yar   2016 , however, found that direct forms of communication, such as email, MSN and Skype, and Tweeting,  increased  the  odds  of  interpersonal  cyber  victimization,  as  it  increased  the victim’s online visibility.  Individual  involvement  in  various  forms  of  cybercrime  increases  the  risk  of victimization. Specifically, engaging in bullying, harassment, computer hacking, digital piracy,  and  other  forms  of  cybercrime  appears  to  increase  the  risk  associated  with harassment and bullying  Holt and Bossler 2009; Holt et al., 2012; Hinduja and Patchin, 2009; Ngo and Paternoster, 2011; Reyns et al., 2011; Ybarra et al., 2007 . The activities of a person’s friends also increase the risk of victimization, as this directly increases exposure to motivated offenders while also decreasing guardianship  Bossler et al., 2012; Hinduja and Patchin, 2008; Holt and Bossler, 2009; Reyns et al., 2011 .  The  use  of  protective  software  programs,  such  as  parental  filtering  software  and antivirus  programs,  appears  to  do  little  to  reduce  the  risk  of  online  harassment victimization  Holt and Bossler, 2009; Leukfeldt and Yar, 2016; Marcum, 2010; Ngo and Paternoster, 2011 . Moore and associates  2010  found that parental regulation of Internet use  also  had  no  significant  influence  on  the  risk  of  victimization.  Individual  technical skills,  a  form  of  personal  guardianship,  have  a  mixed  influence  on  the  risk  of  online harassment victimization  Bossler et al., 2012; Holt and Bossler, 2009 . In some instances, those  with  greater  computer  proficiency  may  have  an  increased  risk  of  victimization, which  may  stem  from  the  potential  to  recognize  when  they  are  exposed  to  harmful behaviors  or  by  being  in  spaces  that  increase  their  risk  of  victimization   Bocij  and McFarlane, 2002; Hinduja and Patchin, 2008; Holt and Bossler, 2009 . It may also simply have no effect  Leukfeldt and Yar, 2016 .  The importance of online routine behaviors in understanding online economic crime victimization  is  also  dependent  on  the  type  of  victimization  examined.  In  Ngo  and Paternoster’s   2011   examination  of  phishing  victimization  in  a  college  sample,  they found  little  evidence  to  support  the  argument  that  knowledge  of  respondent  online routine behaviors would help predict who is more likely to be a victim of phishing. The only  significant  behavior  that  increased  victimization  was  whether  the  respondent committed  various  forms  of  computer  deviance.  They  did  not  find  that  measures  of exposure  to  motivated  offenders   e.g.,  spending  more  time  on  the  Internet,  writing emails, being in chatrooms, etc. , target suitability  e.g., communicating with strangers, providing  personal  information,  demographics,  etc. ,  and  capable  guardianship   e.g., security software, computer skill, etc.  were related to phishing victimization. In Dutch samples, buying products online and participating in direct communication  e.g., email  and web forums increased the likelihood of being a victim of online fraud  Leukfeldt and Yar, 2016; Van Wilsem, 2013 . These behaviors both increase victim visibility online and  467   make them more accessible by motivated offenders, which differentially increases risk of victimization.  In a study that specifically examined online forms of identity theft, Holt and Turner  2012   examined  the  protective  factors  that  made  certain  individuals  more  resilient  in high-risk  online  environments  where  sensitive  information  must  be  transmitted  to complete an economic transaction or to communicate generally. Within their sample of students,  faculty,  and  staff  at  a  large  university,  they  found  that  only  2.3  percent  of individuals  who  reported  no  risk  factors   defined  in  their  study  as  the  commission  or victimization of different forms of online deviance  had someone obtain their financial information  electronically  without  their  knowledge  or  permission  within  the  last  12 months. Almost 15 percent of individuals who reported at least five of these risk factors reported  being  victims  of  online  identity  theft.  Within  this  group  of  high-risk individuals, they found that individuals who updated their protective software, such as antivirus,  spybot,  and  ad-aware,  were  less  likely  to  be  victimized.  They  did  not  find, however,  that  having  firewall  protection  or  higher  levels  of  computer  skills  decreased victimization within this group.  In  another  recent  study  examining  how  online  routines  affected  identity  theft victimization,  Reyns  and  Henson   2016   used  data  from  the  2009  Canadian  General Social  Survey  and  found  that  individuals  that  did  their  banking  and  made  purchases online were more likely to be victims of identity theft. Individuals who posted personal information  on  social  media  sites  and  other  online  spaces  were  also  more  likely  to  be victimized.  Importantly,  those  who  had  been  targeted  by  hackers  or  responded  to  a phishing  email  were  also  much  more  likely  to  be  victimized,  suggesting  that  identity theft may result by being victimized via other forms of cybercrime  Reyns and Henson, 2016 . It also appears that racial minorities individuals with a higher income, and those who  participate  in  online  activities  were  viewed  as  more  suitable  targets,  which increased their chances of identity theft victimization.  Recent research by Maimon and colleagues  2013  has also tested hypotheses derived from  routine  activity  theory  to  better  understand  computer  intrusions  of  university networks  using  Intrusion  Prevention  System  data.  They  found  that  computer  attacks were more likely to occur during university official business hours when more network users  were  online  and  that  an  increase  in  foreign-born  network  users  was  associated with  more  attacks  from  those  countries  of  origin.  In  summary,  routine  activity  theory has shown itself to be the most empirically sound theory in explaining both traditional and cyber victimization.  General theory of crime and victimization  Another theory used by scholars to account for cybercrime victimization is whether the individual  characteristics  of  the  victim  somehow  influenced  the  odds  of  their victimization.  The  most  common  individual  theoretical  trait  that  researchers  have  468   examined in relation to victimization is the individual’s level of self-control. Although Gottfredson  and  Hirschi   1990   consider  self-control  theory  to  be  a  general  theory  of crime, and not technically a theory of victimization, they argue that the high correlation between offending and victimization is because both are a result of inadequate levels of self-control  pp. 92–94 .  The  characteristics  of  low  self-control   i.e.,  short-sighted,  insensitive,  impatient,  risk taking  that increase the odds of offending also theoretically increase the likelihood of victimization through various mechanisms  Schreck, 1999 . Individuals with lower levels of self-control do not accurately consider and perceive the consequences of their actions, both increasing the probability of crime and victimization. They put themselves in risky situations and act inappropriately, increasing opportunities to offend, while at the same time placing themselves in close proximity to offenders who may prey upon them.  Research  over  the  past  decade  has  shown  that  Gottfredson  and  Hirschi’s  concept  of low self-control is a consistent but modest predictor of why certain individuals are more likely to be victimized  Pratt, Turnanovic, Fox, and Wright, 2014 . Its effect, however, is stronger  for  non-contact  forms  of  victimization   e.g.,  fraud   than  for  direct  contact victimization,  and  decreases  when  controlling  for  risky  behaviors  that  could  possibly mediate the relationship  Pratt et al., 2014 .  Low self-control and cybercrime victimization  The  link  between  low  self-control  and  traditional  victimization  appears  to  apply  to cybercrime  victimization  in  a  variety  of  ways.  First,  individuals  with  low  self-control favor  short-term  immediate  gratification  with  little  regard  for  long-term  consequences  Gottfredson  and  Hirschi,  1990 .  Their  enjoyment  of  risk  taking  and  thrill  seeking decreases  the  safety  of  themselves  and  their  property,  increasing  vulnerability  to victimization  Schreck, 1999 . In online environments, individuals with low self-control engage  in  risky  behaviors  which  opens  them  up  to  malicious  software  infection  and other  forms  of  victimization   Holt  and  Bossler,  2009 .  They  may  also  interact  with strangers in chatrooms and other virtual environments and provide them with sensitive information that could lead to online harassment or cyberstalking.  Second, individuals with low self-control have little empathy for others. This makes it difficult  for  them  to  relate  to  others,  create  stronger  social  ties,  and  understand  other people’s  intentions   Gottfredson  and  Hirschi,  1990;  Schreck,  1999 ,  all  increasing  their vulnerability.  If  individuals  have  challenges  interacting  with  others  face  to  face,  their problems are probably compounded in a virtual environment. Third, their low tolerance means they are more likely to want to resolve issues physically rather than mentally and may  get  easily  angered  or  frustrated.  Individuals  who  may  get  easily  frustrated  or provoked when dealing with others online may simply escalate situations and increase the chances of harassment, bullying, or threatening online interactions.  Finally,  individuals  with  low  tolerance  may  increase  their  vulnerability  when  they  469   become easily frustrated with complex security devices and stop using them or not use them correctly  Schreck, 1999 . Unfortunately, computer security programs can be quite complex  and  are  not  necessarily  intuitive.  They  are,  however,  necessary  to  protect  a computer, its data, and the security of the user. In addition, computer owners must be diligent and regularly update protective software. Individuals with low self-control are generally not diligent and will not consistently make the effort to protect their computer and themselves.  Empirical  research  generally  finds  that  self-control  is  associated  with  cybercrime victimization. The type of cybercrime victimization, however, is an important factor in assessing the size of the relationship. Low self-control may help understand cybercrime victimization  where  the  person  is  the  target   e.g.,  having  a  password  changed; harassment   and  not  computers  in  general   e.g.,  large  phishing  attempts:  Bossler  and Holt, 2010; Holt, Bossler, Malinski, and May, 2016; Pratt et al., 2014 . When the effect of low self-control is statistically significant, its impact is small.  For example, Bossler and Holt  2010  examined the effect of low self-control on five cybercrime victimization types in a college sample. They found that having lower levels of self-control increased the risk of one’s passwords being obtained to access computer accounts and files, someone adding, deleting, or changing information in one’s computer files  without  the  owner’s  knowledge  or  permission,  and  being  harassed  online.  Other studies have also found low self-control to be a significant, albeit not the most important, predictor  of  both  sexual  and  non-sexual  online  harassment  victimization  and cyberstalking   Fox,  Nobles,  and  Fisher,  2016;  Holt  et  al  .,  2016;  Ngo  and  Paternoster, 2011 .  The  literature  on  the  relationship  between  low  self-control  and  economic  crime victimization is mixed, as it depends on the type of victimization studied and the sample utilized.  Low  self-control  has  not  been  found  to  be  significantly  related  to  electronic credit  card  theft   Bossler  and  Holt,  2010   and  phishing  attacks   Ngo  and  Paternoster, 2011  in college samples. Scholars using Dutch datasets, however, have found that there is significant overlap between the commission of online financial cybercrimes and cyber victimization, including the role low self-control plays in increasing the odds of various forms  of  online  fraud  victimization,  including  consumer  fraud,  auction  fraud,  virtual theft, and identity fraud  Kerstens and Jansen, 2016; van Wilsem, 2013 .  In  summary,  Gottfredson  and  Hirschi’s   1990   general  theory  of  crime  provides  an interesting  perspective  of  how  an  individual’s  characteristics  increase  the  risk  of victimization.  The  inability  of  individuals  with  low  self-control  to  prevent  themselves from committing acts that have long-term negative consequences may also increase their odds  of  victimization  by  placing  them  in  risky  situations  with  the  wrong  people  Schreck,  1999 .  Although  the  major  arguments  logically  apply  to  cybercrime victimization as well, empirical studies show that low self-control is a weak predictor of person-based  cyber  victimization  types,  such  as  online  harassment  and  hacking victimization.  It  may  be  that  this  relationship  stems  from  the  fact  that  individuals  with  low  self-  470   control  are  more  likely  to  associate  with  delinquent  peers  who  are  more  likely  to victimize those who are in close proximity to themselves. For instance, Bossler and Holt  2010   found  that  low  self-control’s  effect  on  hacking  and  harassment  victimization became non-significant when controlling for peer offending. This meant that low self- control did not directly cause these victimizations due to impulsivity or carelessness, but that low self-control increased their likelihood of associating with delinquent peers who were  probably  more  likely  to  victimize  the  respondent.  This  relationship  should  be further explored to refine our understanding of the relationship between self-control and victimization generally.  471   Need for new cyberspace theories?  Although  there  are  a  number  of  traditional  criminological  theories  that  have  been applied to cybercrimes, a few researchers have called for new theoretical paradigms that may  more  accurately  account  for  these  offenses.  For  instance,  K.  Jaishankar   2008  proposed a theory he called space transition theory, which argues that people behave differently while online than they otherwise would in physical space. In turn, individual behavioral patterns are different online than they are in physical space. This theory has seven basic postulates about both human behavior and offending generally:  1.  Persons  with  repressed  criminal  behavior   in  the  physical  space   have  a propensity  to  commit  crime  in  cyberspace,  which  otherwise  they  would  not commit in physical space, due to their status and position.  2.  Identity flexibility, dissociative anonymity, and lack of deterrence factor in that  cyberspace offer the offenders the choice to commit cybercrime.  3.  Criminal  behavior  of  offenders  in  cyberspace  is  likely  to  be  imported  to  physical space; that in physical space may be exported to cyberspace as well.  4.  Intermittent  ventures  of  offenders   in  cyberspace  and   the  dynamic  spatiotemporal nature of cyberspace provide the chance to escape.  5.   a   Strangers  are  likely  to  unite  in  cyberspace  to  commit  crime  in  physical space; and  b  associates in physical space are likely to unite to commit crime in cyberspace.  6.  Persons from a closed society are more likely to commit crimes in cyberspace  7.  The conflict of norms and values of physical space with the norms and values  than persons from an open society.  of cyberspace may lead to cybercrimes.  The utility of this theory has yet to be identified, as few have empirically investigated these hypothesized relationships. Some of these concepts are variants of concepts from previously  discussed  theories,  such  as  social  learning  theory.  Other  propositions, however,  appear  incongruent  with  some  of  the  information  presented  throughout  this book. For instance, there is clear evidence that data thieves may not know one another offline but interact regularly in virtual spaces to buy and sell personal information  see Chapter 6 . Furthermore, the rates of participation in cybercrimes like cyberbullying are somewhat consistent across place, regardless of the political landscape of the nation  see Chapter  9 .  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  these  insights  apply  more  to  some  forms  of cybercrime than to others. Regardless, space transition theory is one of the few theories created  specifically  to  address  cybercrime.  Only  future  empirical  testing  of  this  theory will  be  able  to  assess  these  propositions.  In  addition,  this  theory  may  inspire  other scholars to create cybercrime-specific theories.  472   Another promising approach is to modify traditional criminological theories to better fit the realities of cyberspace. Goldsmith and Brewer  2015  recently created the concept of digital drift based on Matza’s  1964, 1969  drift theory which argues that youth are not  completely  socialized  into  a  delinquent  subculture  but  rather  are  exposed  to delinquent youth and belief systems that help neutralize or justify delinquent behavior. Goldsmith and Brewer argue that technology creates a wide variety of opportunities for individuals  to  both  engage  and  disengage  from  different  criminal  communities  online and offline. The anonymity and escapism provided by the Internet allow individuals to be exposed to different communities that are disconnected from their actual identity and act in ways online that they would not have otherwise in the traditional world.  The Internet provides two conditions necessary for digital drift to occur according to Goldsmith  and  Brewer:  affinity  and  affiliation.  Affinity  refers  to  the  various  online content  that  may  appear  attractive  and  exciting  to  youth   e.g.,  pornography,  hacking tips,  free  music,  etc. ,  but  exposes  them  to  criminal  behaviors  and  justifications  which suggest that these online behaviors are socially acceptable. Affiliation refers to the means by which youth are able to interact and deepen their relationships with online deviants and  offenders.  Accessing  and  spending  time  with  new  online  social  networks  exposes youth  to  individuals  who  may  provide  justifications,  neutralizations,  and  reassurances that  the  wrongdoing  is  “normal.”  Youth  may  therefore  drift  back  and  forth  between conformity and deviance depending on whether they are online or not as well as with what specific social network they are associating.  Digital drift would appear to be a useful framework to understand how individuals, particularly  youth,  become  exposed  to  and  commit  common  forms  of  cybercrime  and cyberdeviance by exploring online communities. As discussed in various chapters of this book,  individuals  can  learn  techniques  and  justifications  to  hack   Chapter  3 ,  commit digital piracy  Chapter 5 , download pornography  Chapter 7 , and bully  Chapter 9  via exchanges  with  online  networks.  Goldsmith  and  Brewer   2015 ,  however,  apply  their theoretical adaptation to explain acts of lone-wolf terrorism and pedophilia. In the end, Goldsmith  and  Brewer  have  provided  an  interesting  modified  theory  which  may  be applied to multiple forms of cybercrime, but a great deal more of theoretical discussion and empirical research is necessary by the academic community.  Finally,  another  possible  step  for  criminologists  to  better  understand  cybercrime offending and victimization is to look at scholarly work from other fields, including, but not  limited  to:  computer  science,  information  technology,  psychology,  and  political science.  Criminologists  primarily  examine  the  behavioral  aspects  of  cybercrime offending  and  victimization  from  a  sociological  perspective.  They  do  not  have  the expertise  and  backgrounds  needed  to  properly  examine  how  the  brain  operates,  how global dynamics influence individual behavior, and how to improve computer security safeguards.  Drawing  from  the  expertise  of  these  relevant  fields  could  greatly  improve our  understanding  of  cybercrime  and  identify  alternative  strategies  to  address involvement in cybercrime offenses  see Box 11.5 for examples of psychological theories of cybercrime .  473   Box 11.5 Psychological theories of cybercrime  Needs analysis surveys for computer crime investigations indicated that the ability to  obtain  reliable  and  valid  offender  profiles  were  pressing  issues  in  law enforcement   Rogers  and  Seigfried,  2004 .  In  addition,  Loch  and  Conger   1996  concluded,  “individual  characteristics  all  appear  to  be  important  in  determining ethical  computing  decisions”   p.  82 .  Thus,  research  should  not  only  focus  on information  assurance  and  security,  but  also  on  the  personality  and  cognitive characteristics  associated  with  computer  criminality.  This  box  briefly  summarizes three  psychological  theories  which  have  been  applied  to  various  cyberdeviance: theory of moral development, theory of planned behavior, and theory of reciprocal determinism.  Theory of moral development  Kohlberg, 1976   According  to  Kohlberg   1976 ,  moral  reasoning  transforms  and  develops  through three  levels,  with  two  stages  within  each  level.  In  the  pre-conventional  level   I , morality is “external,” meaning that children view a behavior as “good” or “bad” due to  perceived  rewards  and  consequences.  In  Stage  1,  children  engage  in  behavior because of hedonistic rewards and praise that follow and refrain from engaging in certain  behaviors  to  avoid  possible  negative  consequences.  In  Stage  2,  the  child continues  to  make  decisions  that  satisfy  their  own  needs  while  occasionally satisfying the needs of others. A sense of reciprocity and the motto, “you scratch my back, and I will scratch yours” begins. In the conventional level  II ,  the  individual begins to recognize and be influenced by social order. In order to move into Stage 3, the  child  must  be  able  to  recognize  the  viewpoints  of  others.  In  Stage  3,  moral behavior is reflected in the labels assigned to the child by his or her family, peers, and other social groups. The child recognizes that there are good and bad behaviors and it is important to be viewed by others as either a “good girl or good boy.” Stage 4  refers  to  the  “law  and  order”  orientation,  meaning  the  child  feels  bound  by  the need  to  follow  rules  in  order  to  maintain  social  order.  Acting  morally  means conforming to authoritative figures and obeying social rules. In the final level, post- conventional  III ,  morality  is  ultimately  internalized,  and  the  individual  begins  to define morality apart from formal  laws, social rules  and informal social controls  peer groups, family . In Stage 5, the individual recognizes the welfare of others and the fact that moral decisions are made for “the greater good.” There is a utilitarian approach to moral decision making, meaning decisions should be made to maximize happiness  and  reduce  suffering.  Finally,  Stage  6  is  the  highest  stage  of  moral development known as the “universal ethical principle orientation.” In this stage, an individual  has  abstract  moral  principles  guided  by  a  sense  of  basic  human  rights,  474   objectivity, and equal respect for all.  Research  has  compared  the  stages  of  moral  development  with  ethical  computer decisions. For example, Gordon  1994  compared the moral stages of development in a sample of virus writers classified as adolescent, young adult, professional adult, or ex-virus writers. Results suggested that the adolescent and young adult virus writers were  within  normal  ranges  for  moral  development  when  compared  to  their  non- virus  writer  age  mates.  The  adult  virus  writers,  however,  were  in  lower  stages  of moral  development  compared  to  their  non-virus  writer  age  mates   Gordon,  1994 . Rogers   2010   believed  that  script  kiddies,  the  least  technical  hacker,  were  only  at Stage  2  of  moral  development  due  to  their  immaturity  and  attention-seeking behavior. As for cyber-punks and identity thieves, their disregard for authority and selfish tendencies also place them in a similar stage of moral development as script kiddies.  The  heterogeneity  of  virus  writers  makes  it  difficult  to  assign  a  specific stage of moral development, as virus writers can range anywhere from Stage 2 to Stage 5 of moral development. Finally, Rogers  2010  suggests that the professionals  i.e.,  an  elite  group  of  hackers   rank  in  one  of  the  higher  categories  of  moral development,  Stage  5,  because  of  their  flexibility  of  moral  character,  since professionals may be either white-, gray-, or black-hat hackers, depending on which hacker code they follow.  Theory of planned behavior  Ajzen, 1985, 1991   The theory of planned behavior  Ajzen, 1985  argues that whether a person intends to  engage  in  certain  behaviors  is  determined  by:  attitude  toward  the  behavior, subjective  norm,  and  perceived  behavioral  control.  First,  this  theory  suggests  that beliefs  create  attitudes.  Behavioral  beliefs,  which  are  the  expected  outcomes  for engaging  in  a  particular  behavior,  influence  our attitude toward the behavior.  For example, we are more likely to have a positive attitude toward eating apples if we have positive beliefs about apples, such as “an apple a day keeps the doctor away.” In predicting someone’s behavior, we also need to examine their concern over “what others might think,” referred to as subjective norms, as well as how other people will react to that particular behavior, or normative beliefs. Returning to the example of the apple, we may be more motivated to eat an apple rather than French fries if we want  to  be  perceived  as  healthy  by  our  peers.  Finally,  our  opinions  of  perceived control, whether we are capable of engaging in the particular behavior, also affect whether we are likely to engage in certain behaviors. Perceived control is influenced by our control beliefs, which are beliefs about the presence of factors that may help or hurt our ability to engage in a particular behavior. If your favorite fast-food chain was closing, you might need to decide between being perceived as healthy by your friends  or  eating  your  favorite  unhealthy  food  at  the  restaurant  that  is  closing. Overall, all of these beliefs – behavioral, normative, and control – guide the creation  475   of behavioral intentions, and these beliefs will be weighted differently based on their importance to a particular behavior.  Only  a  few  studies  have  applied  the  theory  of  planned  behavior   Ajzen,  1985, 1991   to  unethical  computer  behaviors.  Chang   1998   found  that  perceived behavioral control was the most significant predictor of people’s intentions to pirate software.  Regardless  of  a  person’s  intentions,  the  appropriate  resources  or opportunities  must  be  present  in  order  for  that  person  to  engage  in  unethical computer  behavior.  Rennie  and  Shore   2007   suggested  six  controls  to  curb  a person’s intentions to engage in computer hacking:  1  computer security legislation;  2   reducing  vulnerability  of  computer  systems;   3   parental  controls;   4   reducing peer  pressure;   5   cyber  policing;  and   6   reducing  access  to  hacking  tools.  These controls  relate  directly  to  Ajzen’s   1985   perceived  control,  subjective  norms,  and attitude  toward  the  behavior.  For  example,  encouraging  parents  to  talk  to  their children about computer ethics, as well as reducing the impact of peer pressure, may deter an individual from computer hacking due to changes in subjective norms. In addition,  strengthening  computer  and  information  security,  as  well  as  making  it difficult to obtain computer hacking tools, will increase the perceived controls over one’s  ability  to  engage  in  computer  hacking.  Finally,  through  computer  security legislation and cyber policing, an individual will more likely view computer hacking in a negative light due to the possible negative outcomes  i.e., prosecution .  Theory of reciprocal determinism  Bandura, 1977   When we try to understand “why” people behave in a certain way, we tend to argue for  either  nature  or  nurture  explanations.  Bandura’s   1977   theory  of  reciprocal determinism  combined  the  classic  “nature  versus  nurture”  attitude  into  a  social cognitive theory that acknowledges both the external and internal factors related to human  behavior.  The  theory  of  reciprocal  determinism  states  that  psychological, biological,  and  cognitive   personal  internal  factors  =  P     and  environmental    external factors = E   factors all interact and exert bidirectional influences on human nature   behavior = B  . These factors intermingle and affect one another in multiple directions; however, reciprocity does not imply equality in the amount of influence that one factor has over another  Bandura, 1977, 1978, 1994 . Overall, determinism reflects an interaction among multiple variables in multiple directions rather than an independent relationship resulting in unidirectional cause and effect. In addition, the variables in the tripartite model differ with regard to their strength or magnitude of influence  on  human  nature.  According  to  Bandura   1986 ,  “when  situational constraints  are  weak,  personal  factors  serve  as  the  predominant  influence  in  the regulatory system”  p. 35 . If environmental constraints are “weak,” then there are ineffective barriers preventing an individual from engaging in a particular behavior. For example, the globalization of technology has created an environment where  476   Internet child pornography is readily available, accessible, and affordable  Triple-A Engine:  see  Cooper,  1998 .  Essentially,  viewing  child  pornography  is  both  easy  to commit  and  one  does  not  get  caught.  There  are  other  external  factors,  unique  in some aspects to cyberspace, which may influence whether an individual engages in computer  deviance.  According  to  Campbell  and  Kennedy   2009 ,  “characteristics inherent to the electronic environment may contribute to antinormative behaviors”  p.  18 ,  specifically  anonymity   Lipson,  2002 ,  reduced  social  cues   Kiesler  and Sproull, 1992 , and deindividuation  Zimbardo, 1969 . As stated by Morahan-Martin and Schumacher  2000 , “Social contact over the Internet does not involve face-to- face communication and can even be anonymous, which can lessen social risk and lower inhibitions”  p. 25 . Internet users are able to try out new roles, identities, and self-presentations,  which  is  facilitated  by  the  perceived  anonymity  or  “cloak  of safety”  provided  by  the  Internet.  For  example,  anonymizers,  steganography,  and encryption are considered hacker “tools of the trade,” which provide some level of anonymity and secrecy online  Holt, 2010 .  Overall,  Bandura’s  theory  of  reciprocal  determinism  incorporates  both  the environmental  and  personal  factors  associated  with  human  behavior.  Preliminary research suggests that this theory may explain why some people are more likely to engage in cybercrime, specifically Internet child pornography, when others do not. Future  research  is  needed  to  determine  whether  this  theory  is  applicable  to  other forms of cybercrime.  What similarities do you see between these three psychological theories and the  criminological theories covered in this chapter?  477   Summary  Criminological  theory  has  much  to  offer  to  our  understanding  of  both  cybercrime offending  and  victimization.  Although  the  criminological  theories  discussed  in  this chapter provide important insights into why certain individuals are more likely to offend or  be  victimized,  empirical  studies  have  provided  more  support  for  certain  theories overall.  For  example,  Ron  Akers’   1998   social  learning  theory  is  currently  the  best theoretical framework we have to understand both traditional and cybercrime offending. Cohen  and  Felson’s   1979   routine  activity  theory  is  the  most  utilized  and  supported theory  to  explain  traditional  and  cyber  victimization.  Other  theories  have  shown moderate support and need more scrutiny to determine their validity for cybercrime.  Most  assessments  involve  some  form  of  digital  piracy  offending  and  harassment victimization. An increased amount of work is occurring explaining the correlates and causes of computer hacking and identity theft, but scant research has been conducted on more  complex  forms  of  cybercrime  such  as  malicious  software  distribution  and cyberterrorism.  In  addition,  it  is  possible  that  cybercrime  with  all  of  its  unique characteristics will prompt new theories to be created. The creation of new theories to explain crime in the virtual world may not only help provide a better understanding of cybercrime,  but  may  possibly  also  lead  to  new  insights  about  crime  in  the  physical world.

Kimberly was lured to Wellwood’s home where she was beaten, tortured, and sexually assaulted for  several  hours,  her  legs  and  arms  were  bound  with  duct  tape,  and  her  head  was covered with a plastic bag. Kimberly was stuffed into a freezer and then left overnight. According  to  court  documents,  she  died  of  asphyxiation.  The  medical  examiner, however, was unable to determine if she was deceased prior to or after being placed in the freezer. In the morning, her body was driven to a secluded area under a bridge where the  teenage  boys  set  her  on  fire.  This  crime  was  solved  thanks  to  a  digital  trail  of evidence  left  behind  by  the  two  teenage  boys.  According  to  Roberts   2011 ,  “police investigating  this  case  [.]  gathered  the  digital  equivalent  of  1.4  billion  pages  of  paper evidence, including Facebook and MSN messages, text messages and chat histories”  para 7 . For example, while chatting on World of Warcraft, Wellwood confessed to the murder of Kimberly Proctor to his online gamer girlfriend  Zetter, 2011 . In 2011, both teenage boys  pleaded  guilty  to  first-degree  murder  and  indignity  to  human  remains  and  were sentenced as adults to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for ten years. The murder of Kimberly Proctor was solved through the use of digital forensics.  Before we discuss the evolution of digital forensics, it is important to understand what we mean by the term forensic science. Forensic science is the application of science to the  law,  meaning  the  scientific  process  of  gathering  and  examining  information  to  be used by the criminal justice system  see Saferstein, 2010 . When compared to the other fields of forensic science, digital forensics is in its infancy. Consider the field of forensic entomology. Forensic entomology is the study of insects in death investigations, and its first  recorded  use  was  in  a  homicide  investigation  in  thirteenth-century  China  McKnight, 1981 . The case involved a homicide where the weapon was determined to be a sickle. All of the men in the village laid their sickles down on the ground, and although they all appeared to be “clean” to the naked eye, the murderer’s sickle became covered with flies due to the small traces of blood and tissue that remained on the sickle – the murderer  then  confessed  to  the  crime   McKnight,  1981 .  You  may  be  asking  yourself, “What does forensic entomology have to do with the history of digital forensics?” Think about all of the changes that have occurred over the years in the different branches of forensic science – the advancements with technology in DNA analysis or the ability to obtain latent fingerprints. It only makes sense that digital forensics is a new branch of forensic science – it could not exist without the advent of computer technology.  A  central  theme  throughout  this  chapter  is  the  fact  that  technology  has  been  the driving  force  behind  the  field  of  computer  forensics.  The  field  of  computer  forensics  490   evolved  into  the  field  of  digital  forensics  as  technology  continued  to  influence  law enforcement investigations.  Digital forensics may be the youngest of the forensic sciences, but that does not mean it is the least important. By the end of this chapter, you will appreciate how almost every criminal investigation now involves some form of digital evidence. In addition, you will understand  the  difficulty  law  enforcement  faces  when  trying  to  identify  and  recover evidence from the ever-changing and developing digital world. Finally, we will explore the  importance  of  evidence  integrity  and  forensic  soundness,  since  digital  evidence  is only admissible if its authenticity can be verified in a court of law.  491   From computer forensics to digital forensics  The need for computer forensics developed with the onset of the Information Age  or Digital  Age;  this  digital  revolution  was  marked  by  the  increased  production, transmission,  and  consumption  of,  and  reliance  on,  information.  Modern  computers began to emerge in the mid-twentieth century and were mostly owned and operated by large  corporations,  such  as  universities  and  government  agencies.  At  this  time, traditional  computer  crime  investigations  were  the  theft  of  computers  or  computer components. However, the Information Age changed the meaning of the term computer crime.  As  personal  computers  surfaced  in  the  mid-1970s,  old  crimes  with  new  tricks emerged  as  well,  and  computer  crimes  were  no  longer  limited  to  only  the  theft  of components.  Computers  were  now  being  used  to  commit  old crimes  using  new tricks, referring  specifically  to  financial  crimes   fraud,  embezzlement ,  the  majority  of  which were  committed  by  insiders   Clifford,  2006 .  For  example,  individuals  employed  at financial  institutions  embezzled  money  by  writing  computer  programs  that  would transfer one-tenth of a cent into their account  Fernandez, Smith, Garcia, and Kar, 2005 . This type of fraud is referred to as salami slicing because only small amounts of money are  taken  from  each  account,  but  the  dividends  add  up  to  a  tremendous  sum   Kabay, 2002 . With computers being used as the means for criminal activity, such as computer fraud or embezzlement, there was a growing concern of how best to combat these “old crimes with new tricks.”  By  the  late  1970s,  there  was  increasing  recognition  that  computer  criminality  was growing on a national and international scale. In 1976, the Council of Europe Conference on  Criminological  Aspects  of  Economic  Crime  was  held  in  Strasbourg,  France.  This conference identified several categories of computer crime, including fraud  Schjolberg, 2004 .  In  the  USA,  the  first  federal  cybercrime  legislation  was  introduced,  the  Federal Computer  Systems  Protection  Act  of  1977,  by  Senator  Ribikoff.  This  Act  would  make “the use, for fraudulent or other illegal purposes, of any computer owned or operated by the  United  States,  certain  financial  institutions,  and  entitles  affecting  interstate commerce”  a  federal  crime.  Although  this  act  was  not  passed,  Senator  Ribikoff  is credited for raising awareness of the need for cybercrime legislation  Clifford, 2006 .  Shortly thereafter, Florida became the first state to enact a cybercrime law, the Florida Computer  Crimes  Act  of  1978.  This  legislation  was  in  response  to  a  scandal  at  the Flagler  Dog  Track  in  Miami,  Florida,  where  employees  used  a  computer  to  print fraudulent  tickets   see  Box  12.1;  Hochman,  1986 .  The  Florida  Computer  Crimes  Act  1978  cited offenses against intellectual property, offenses against computer equipment or supplies, and offenses against computer users. In other words, it was a felony to access another’s computer or modify, delete, or copy files without authorization, and it became a misdemeanor to modify or damage computer equipment without authorization. In the  492   USA, a felony is considered to be a more serious criminal act that is usually punishable by  one  year  or  more  in  prison,  whereas  a  misdemeanor  is  considered  a  less  serious offense that is usually punishable by up to one year in jail  see Kamisar, LaFave, Israel, King,  and  Kerr,  2008 .  It  was  not  until  1986  that  the  USA  passed  its  first  federal  law criminalizing the unauthorized access of a computer, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  see Chapters 3 and 4 for more detail on the revised statutes .  Box 12.1 The Flagler Dog Track incident  https:  www.si.com vault 1979 07 23 106774166 win-placeand-sting.  Win place . . . and sting  John Underwood  July 23, 1979  [Jacques Lavigne] knew he was going to make a potful of money. [.] He could do it quickly enough to avoid suspicion. And [.] right under the noses of the men the state paid to stand watch – because they knew zilch about computers.  This article describes one of the first instances of computer crime, which became a seminal  case  in  the  development  of  legislation  for  the  USA.  Readers  will  gain  an understanding  of  how  technology  was  viewed  at  the  time,  and  how  it  has dramatically changed over the past few decades.  In  1979,  Interpol,  the  world’s  largest  police  agency,  was  the  first  international organization to address the growing concern of computer fraud: “The nature of computer crime  is  international,  because  of  the  steadily  increasing  communications,  [.]  between the different countries. International organizations, like Interpol, should give this aspect more  attention”   Interpol,  1979;  Schjolberg,  2004 .  It  was  not  until  1983  that  an ad hoc committee  sponsored  by  the  OECD  assessed  the  need  for  an  international  response  to cybercrime.  The  OECD  is  an  intergovernmental  organization  comprising  29  countries, including  the  USA,  which  promotes  policy  making  among  Member  and  non-Member States and the United Nations  Clifford, 2006 . The final report recommended a “harmo- nization of criminal laws” that penalized computer fraud, computer forgery, damage to computer data, copyright infringement, and unauthorized computer access  Schjolberg,  493   2008 .  Fig. 12.1 Floppy disks The 8-inch floppy disk was created by IBM’s Alan Shugart in 1971. Source: Wikimedia Commons  By  the  1980s,  more  and  more  computer  crimes  were  being  committed  during  the Information  Age,  and  law  enforcement  officers  found  themselves  collecting  digital evidence,  specifically  computers  and  floppy  disks,  from  financial  and  computer  fraud investigations. However, law enforcement needed a way to convert computer evidence into “physical” evidence. For example, holding an 8-inch floppy disk  see Figure 12.1  in front of the jury does not give them a sense of its evidentiary value – the jury must be able to see the contents of the floppy disk.  The ability to convert computer evidence into “physical” evidence fueled the need for computer forensics, which is the examination of powered-down computer components, also  known  as  dead-box  forensics.  Computer  forensics,  a  branch  of  the  forensic sciences,  refers  to  the  investigation  and  analysis  of  media  originating  from  digital sources  in  an  effort  to  uncover  evidence  to  present  in  a  court  of  law   Britz,  2009 . However,  only  government  agencies,  such  as  the  Internal  Review  Service   IRS ,  were developing computer forensic tools at this time, and these tools were not made available to other law enforcement agencies or industry. This all changed when Norton Utilities  494   released to the public the UnErase tool, which was capable of recovering lost or deleted files  Fernandez et al., 2005; Nelson, Phillips, Enfinger, and Steuart, 2004 . Norton did not intend  to  create  a  forensic  tool,  but  this  product’s  ability  to  recover latent,  or  hidden, evidence made an important contribution to the computer forensics field.  For  more  information  on  the  utility  and  processes  of  UnErase,  go  online  to: www.symantec.com region can eng press 1999 n990621.html.  Although  there  was  some  progress  being  made  with  computer  evidence,  Charters  2009  states that the early 1980s should be considered pre-forensics because there was a lack of formal structure, protocols, training, and adequate tools. This pre-forensics stage is also known as the Ad Hoc phase and is considered to be the first stage of evolution for computer forensics. The term “ ad hoc  ”  refers  to  something  that  has  been  created because  of  an  immediate  need,  and  because  of  this  immediate  need  the  approach  is usually  unmethodical  or  unprincipled   i.e.,  not  theory  driven .  According  to  Charters  2009 , it was during the Ad Hoc phase that corporations began to collect evidence that their computer systems were being “inappropriately” used by employees. According to Shaw, Ruby, and Post  1998 , “staff employees pose perhaps the greatest risk in terms of access and potential damage to critical information systems” because they are viewed as trusted  members  of  the  organization   p.  3 .  However,  during  the  Ad Hoc  phase,  upper management  lacked  specific  company  policies  defining  “appropriate  vs.  inappropriate computer  usage”  as  well  as  procedures  for  due  process.  Therefore,  when  these inappropriate use cases did make it to trial, the courts raised questions about the chain- of-custody procedures and accuracy of the computer forensic tools.  In  addition,  during  the  Ad Hoc  phase,  law  enforcement  officers  were  analyzing  the original  evidence  –  rather  than  a  duplicate  or  backup  copy  –  so  any  modifications  or errors  during  the  computer  forensic  examination  directly  affected  the  accuracy  of  the evidence.  Accuracy  refers  to  the  integrity  of  the  data,  such  as  whether  or  not  the evidence  remains  unchanged  or  has  been  altered  by  the  computer  forensics  tool.  In addition,  the  courts  were  concerned  with  chain  of  custody,  which  refers  to  the chronological documentation of evidence as it is processed during the investigation  i.e., seizure,  custody,  transfer,  and  analysis:  Britz,  2009 .  This  was  one  of  the  most unfortunate aspects of the Ad Hoc phase – the fact that cases were lost due to the lack of policies and standardized tools in this new field of forensic science  Charters, 2009 .  495   For  example,  an  employee  was  fired  for  violating  the  company’s  appropriate  use policy  when  he  was  caught  searching  through  private  personnel  files.  The  employee claimed that he accidentally came across the personnel files, and that just so happened to be the moment his boss walked into the office. After being fired, the employee sued the company  for  wrongful  termination,  claiming  that  law  enforcement  officers  did  not follow procedures for collecting and analyzing the computer evidence. For instance, who was in possession of the evidence during transfer and how was the computer evidence stored?  Of  course,  in  the  1980s,  there  were  no  guidelines  or  protocols  for  computer evidence  collection.  In  addition,  the  attorney  argued  that  there  was  no  proof  of  the computer forensic tool’s accuracy and it was possible that this tool had tampered with the computer evidence. Due to the lack of structure in the Ad Hoc phase, cases like this proved difficult to prosecute.  the  harmonization  between  computer   In  response  to  the  problems  associated  with  the  Ad Hoc  phase,  computer  forensics progressed  into  the  structured  phase  during  the  mid-1980s.  The  structured  phase  is specifically  characterized  by  forensic legislation.  First,  several  federal  statutes procedure policy  and  computer  crime  criminalized  various  forms  of  hacking   see  Chapter  3   and  wire  fraud   i.e.,  fraud committed  through  the  use  of  electronic  communication:  Clifford,  2006 .  In  addition, companies  drafted  appropriate  use  policies  for  their  employees  as  well  as  due  process procedures for investigating violations of these new policies. Finally, the courts pushed the  field  of  computer  forensics  to  develop  tools  that  could  withstand  courtroom challenges,  along  with  standards  for  evidence  collection   Charters,  2009 .  During  the beginning  of  the  structured  phase,  most  of  the  computer  forensic  examinations  were confined  to  a  single  computer  component  and  suspect.  Few  law  enforcement  officers were  “trained”  in  computer  forensics   i.e.,  they  were  self-declared  experts ,  and  the forensic tools were expensive, so the collection and examination of computer evidence was either inaccessible or unaffordable for most law enforcement agencies.  However, more and more people began owning a personal computer, cell phone, or other digital device, so more and more crimes were being committed that involved some form of digital evidence. The way people used technology was continuously changing as well. For example, cell phones had limited functionality during the early 1990s  e.g., they could  not  send  text  messages  or  connect  to  the  Web   until  the  development  of  the Blackberry  and  related  devices  in  the  late  1990s.  Therefore,  technological  evolution forced  changes  in  how  law  enforcement  viewed  computer  evidence.  In  response  to technological  change,  a  number  of  professional  organizations  emerged,  such  as  the Scientific  Working  Group  on  Digital  Evidence   SWGDE:  Whitcomb,  2002 .  At  the inaugural  meeting  of  SWGDE  in  1998,  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  and  Postal Inspection  Service  officers  created  the  first  definition  of  digital  evidence:  “any information  of  probative  value  that  is  stored  or  transmitted  in  a  binary  form”  Whitcomb, 2007: 7 . It may seem counterintuitive for the PIS to play such an influential role  in  digital  forensics;  however,  this  agency  investigates  more  than  just  mail  fraud. Shortly thereafter, the first forensic science section on digital evidence was held at the  496   International  Association  for  Forensic  Science  Conference  in  1999   IAFS:  Whitcomb, 2007 .  In  addition,  the  first  peer-reviewed  journal  dedicated  to  digital  evidence,  the International  Journal  of  Digital  Evidence,  debuted  in  2002.  As  evidenced,  the  field  of computer forensics became more structured and organized as industry, practitioners, and academia pursued the science behind digital investigations.  Toward  the  end  of  the  structured  phase,  computer  forensics  evolved  into  what  we now understand to be the field of digital forensics. Computer forensics was no longer a term  that  accurately  represented  the  various  forms  of  digital  evidence.  After  all, computer  forensic  examinations  extend  beyond  the  traditional  forms  of  computer hardware  to  include  other  forms  of  digital  evidence,  defined  as  information  that  is either transferred or stored via a computer  Casey, 2011 . Digital evidence may be found on mobile phones, GPS devices, cameras, and networks, to name a few. Recognizing this growth  in  digital  evidence,  an  umbrella  term  was  created:  digital  forensics.  Digital forensics  refers  to  the  analysis  of  digital  evidence,  which  includes  network  forensics  Internet  traffic ,  computer  forensics,  mobile  device  forensics   e.g.,  cell  phone ,  and malware  forensics   e.g.,  viruses:  see  Chapter  4;  also  Casey,  2011 .  Overall,  digital forensics included a whole array of digital devices, and in most cases the development of new  technology   e.g.,  Xbox,  PlayStation  2   required  new  forensic  tools.  For  example, many gaming consoles, such as Xbox and PlayStation 2, have similar properties to other digital  devices  in  that  users  can  surf  the  Web  or  use  the  gaming  consoles  as  storage devices for media. What these technological advances meant for law enforcement was the  fact  that  the  same  criminal  activities  afforded  to  more  “traditional”  digital  devices  e.g., mobile phones  were now being committed on less traditional digital devices  e.g., Xbox . This assortment of digital technology meant that law enforcement needed more forensic tools to conduct their investigations. Thus, this surge in forensic tools led to the final phase of digital forensics: the enterprise phase.  According to Charters  2009 , the enterprise phase of digital forensics – also known as  the  Golden  Age   Garfinkel,  2010   –  began  in  the  early  2000s.  The  courts  were becoming  more  familiar  with  the  process  of  collecting  and  examining  digital  forensic evidence,  and  the  forensic  industry  began  to  develop  tools  that  allowed  for  the examination  of  computer  evidence.  In  response  to  demands  by  law  enforcement, commercial tools were created that allowed for the examination of evidence on-site; that is to say, at the scene rather than back in the laboratory. During this time, open source digital  forensic  tools  debuted,  which  are  software  programs  that  may  be  freely  used, modified,  and  shared  with  anyone   see  Altheide  and  Carvey,  2011 .  There  is  a  lot  of controversy  surrounding  open  source  digital  forensic  tools  because,  as  part  of  the distribution terms, the source code must be made available, without discrimination, to the general public  Open Source Initiative, n.d. . In other words, computer criminals and law enforcement  and anyone else  will have access to the source code for open source digital forensic tools.  497   For  a  forensic  http:  forensicswiki.org wiki ToolsOpen_Source_Tools.  list  of  open  source  digital   tools,  go  online   to:  The source code is simply the human-readable instructions written by the programmer for how the software works  e.g., Java ; this code is then translated into object code so that the computer can execute the instructions  Zanero and Huebner, 2010 . For closed source  or proprietary software,  usually  the  source  code  is  not  made  available  to  the general public; only the object code, which restricts the ability of users to modify and share  the  software  due  to  copyright  infringement,  is  publicly  shared   Zanero  and Huebner,  2010 .  The  benefits  of  open  source  digital  forensic  tools  are  the  ability  to identify and fix bugs within the software, and the opportunity to learn more about how the  tool  works   Altheide  and  Carvey,  2011;  Zanero  and  Huebner,  2010 .  There  is  an inherent  transparency  with  open  source  software  compared  to  the  black  box  of proprietary  software,  which  some  argue  makes  it  easier  for  open  source  tools  to  be admissible  in  court   Carrier,  2002 .  Both  open  source  and  closed  source  tools  will continue  to  play  an  important  role  in  digital  forensics,  especially  since  crimes increasingly involve at least one digital element  Clifford, 2006; Maras, 2012 .  Think  about  your  own  technological  devices.  You  may  own  a  laptop  or  tablet,  and possibly a smart phone, but what about a MP3 player, gaming system, or Wi-Fi-enabled television?  It  is  possible  that  all  of  these  devices  would  need  to  be  collected  and examined  for  potential  evidence  during  a  digital  forensic  investigation,  and,  with  the globalization of technology and the Internet, there will continue to be an increase in the abundance of digital data that needs to be analyzed for potential evidence. In addition, not only are there more devices, but the sizes of the storage systems have increased as well.  Thus,  the  sheer  amount  of  data  that  needs  to  be  examined  is  daunting  for  law enforcement as well as the cost associated with training, certification, and the forensic equipment.  For these reasons, Garfinkel  2010  argues that the Golden Age of digital forensics is coming to an end. The future of digital forensics will rely on advancements in scientific research  and  standards  for  education  and  certification.  In  addition,  the  future  will  be shaped by digital evidence derived from non-traditional devices and technology, such as drones, Internet of Things  IoT  devices, and vehicle systems. According to the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA , an unmanned aircraft system  UAS , often referred to as  498   a drone, is an aircraft controlled by an operator on the ground instead of the pilot being on board  see www.faa.gov; also Figure 12.2 . As of December 2016, there were at least 616,000 registered drones in the USA  Federal Aviation Administration, 2016 .  As mentioned previously, digital forensics is an umbrella term that houses different branches of forensics. Drone forensics constitutes a subtype of wireless forensics under the  broader  term  of  network  forensics   Singh,  2015 .  According  to  Singh   2015 ,  drone forensics “involves the forensics of the server present at ground level where information is being transferred and stored and the forensics of the drone device”  para 8 .  Fig. 12.2 An unmanned aircraft system  UAS , also known as a drone. The future of digital forensics will involve extracting digital evidence from nontraditional digital devices, such as drones.

For example, footage taken by a drone’s high-definition camera was admitted as  is  using  drones  to  assist   law  enforcement   499   forensic  evidence  in  court  for  a  rape  case  involving  two  students   Pilkington,  2014 .  A specific criminal case example of drone forensics does not exist as yet, but the courts are discussing the authenticity of evidence from drones, such as audio and video recordings  Shaw and Hilton, 2016 . According to Shaw and Hilton  2016 , “a picture is a picture, a video a video”  p. 26 , so the courts should regard drone evidence as “no more or less reliable than evidence gathered by any other method”  p. 27 .  Just  as  with  drones,  digital  forensic  evidence  may  exist  on  non-traditional  devices known  as  the  Internet  of  Things   IoT .  The  Internet  of  Things   IoT   is  defined  as  a “network of physical objects  or ‘things’  that connect to the internet and each other and have the ability to collect and exchange data”  Peyton, 2016: 1 . These objects are able to interact  with  each  other  and  the  Internet  through  embedded  technology   Oriwoh  and Williams, 2015 . In 2009, the number of things connected to the Internet surpassed the number of people worldwide. It is estimated that by 2020 there will be up to 50 billion connected devices worldwide  Evans, 2011 .  Like drone forensics, IoT forensics is a type of wireless forensics. IoT devices include light bulbs, thermostats, door locks, fridges, cars, smart speakers, and even pacemakers, to name a few. According to Frew  2016 , the top five IoT products to try in 2016 were: helmet  concussion  sensors   e.g.,  Shockbox ,  medical  alert  watches   e.g.,  Lively ,  dog activity  monitors   e.g.,  Fitbark ,  smart  running  shoes   e.g.,  SpeedForm  Gemini  2 ,  and smart fitness clothing  e.g., Smart Clothing .  The first criminal case involving a smart IoT device was the murder of Victor Collins  McLaughlin and Allen, 2016 . On November 22, 2015, James Bates called 911 stating that he had found Victor Collins dead in his hot tub. Bates told law enforcement that he had two  friends  over  that  night,  including  Victor  Collins,  to  watch  football  and  drink. Eventually, they all decided to hang out in the hot tub until around 1 a.m. when James Bates  went  to  bed.  According  to  the  Arkansas  State  Crime  Lab,  Victor  Collins’s  death was ruled as a homicide by strangulation  Sitek and Thomas, 2016 . A witness recalled hearing music streaming that night from Collins’s Amazon Echo, a smart speaker that responds to the name “Alexa”  McLaughlin and Allen, 2016 . In addition, Collins owned a smart water meter, which measures the amount of water used hourly  Gilker, 2016 .  Both  the  Amazon  Echo  and  smart  water  meter  were  collected  by  law  enforcement. Law enforcement analyzed the smart water meter and learned that an abnormal amount of  water  was  used  during  a  two-hour  window  on  the  evening  of  the  murder.  Law enforcement believed this data indicated that James Bates cleaned up the murder scene during this two-hour period  Gilker, 2016 . Law enforcement was unable to obtain data from  the  Amazon  Echo,  Alexa.  As  a  result,  the  Prosecutor’s  Office  asked  the  court  to force Amazon to provide data from the Echo for the night in question  see Box 12. 2; also Swearingen,  2016 .  Alexa  works  by  passively  recording  everything  you  say,  although none of the recordings is sent to Amazon unless you use the keyword, Alexa. Only then does  Alexa  record  your  command question,  which  is  then  sent  to  Amazon’s  cloud servers  Swearingen, 2016 .  Court records indicate that Amazon has refused, twice, to turn over any recordings to  500   law enforcement  see also the FBI–Apple Encryption Dispute discussed in Chapter  14 . This  case  is  still  ongoing.  It  is  possible  that  the  company  may  either  be  compelled  to provide the data, or may find a reason to voluntarily provide it to law enforcement. Until such  time,  this  presents  a  challenge  to  law  enforcement  agencies  as  to  how  to  use  all possible data points to support a prosecution.  Box 12.2 Alexa a witness to murder?

Standardizing the investigation  process  generates  consistency  in  how  digital  evidence  is  handled  by  law enforcement personnel. Interestingly, there is no standard process model used to describe the stages of a digital forensic investigation  see Casey, 2011 . Although the terminology is  different,  there  are  four  common  stages  in  the  digital  forensic  investigation: survey identification,  and report presentation.  collection acquisition,   examination analysis,   Survey identification is the initial step of a digital forensic investigation. During this stage,  law  enforcement  personnel  and  digital  forensic  technicians  survey  the  physical  e.g., home office  and digital crime scenes  e.g., Internet  to identify potential sources of digital  evidence.  This  step  is  often  the  most  difficult  because  technology  is  constantly changing and evolving, and less “obvious” digital devices  e.g., PlayStation vs. desktop computer   may  be  overlooked  for  their  potential  evidentiary  value.  For  example,  the Xbox  gaming  system  may  be  modified  to  run  a  different  operating  system,  thereby making it possible to function as a traditional personal computer  e.g., store files, surf the web:  see  Burke  and  Craiger,  2007;  Bolt,  2011 .  In  2010,  20-year-old  Timothy Hammerstone  was  arrested  for  soliciting  sexually  explicit  photos  of  a  10-year-old  boy through his Xbox  see Box 12.3 .  Box 12.3 Video game systems and digital evidence  www.welivesecurity.com 2015 12 24 online-gaming-new-frontier-cybercriminals .  Why online gaming is the new frontier for cybercrime  There  are  two  lines  of  thought  with  criminals  and  online  video  games.  One  is  that  these  connected platforms  offer  easier  opportunities  to  attack,  compromise  and  steal  data.  The  other,  a  relatively  new theory, is that these games, accessible through the internet, are themselves becoming a breeding ground for cybercrime.  This article provides interesting insight into how cybercriminals view online gaming as  a  good  avenue  to  steal  data  and or  convince  players  to  provide  sensitive  bank details.  The  article  also  discusses  the  controversial  argument  made  by  the  UK’s National Crime Agency that online gaming and minor forms of online deviance are stepping stones into more serious forms of cybercrime.  502   Fig. 12.3a and 12.3b Hiding flash drives There are websites that provide advice on how to disguise your USB flash drive. Source: Wikimedia Commons Nrbelex  Along with non-traditional digital devices, some sources of potential evidence may be hidden or disguised as non-digital devices, such as the concealed camera in the ballpoint  503   pen or lighter. There are also websites that provide helpful hints for concealing Universal Serial  Bus   USB   flash  drives  in  everyday  household  items   see  Figure  12.3 .  Finally, surveying the digital crime scene may be difficult because specific cybercrimes, such as hacking and malware, are often committed thousands of miles away from their targeted devices   Britz,  2009 .  Once  the  physical  and  digital  crime  scenes  are  surveyed,  and potential sources of digital evidence are identified, the digital devices must be searched and seized. This stage of the digital forensic investigation is known as the collection or acquisition phase.  The  collection acquisition  phase  of  the  digital  forensic  investigation  is  concerned with  the  retrieval  and  preservation  of  digital  evidence   ISO IEC,  2012 .  First,  digital forensic  technicians  must  document  how  the  digital  evidence  was  retrieved  from  the digital source  e.g., mobile phone  – that is to say, how the mobile phone was searched and  how  the  digital  evidence  was  seized.  For  example,  during  computer  forensic investigations,  technicians  must  determine  whether  to  conduct  an  on-site  or  off-site search; in other words, whether to seize the digital device and search it on-site or off-site at a forensic laboratory  Maras, 2012 . It is important for law enforcement to maintain detailed notes and documentation of the search and seizure process of the digital forensic investigation.  In  addition,  for  any  crime  scene,  whether  traditional  or  digital,  the evidence  must  be  collected  in  a  manner  that  is  forensically  sound  and  preserves  the evidence’s integrity. Evidence retrieved from a digital device must be authenticated in order for it to meet admissibility standards for evidence in a court of law  see Chapter 13 . The goal of evidence preservation is to make a copy of the original data files for examination in a way that minimizes the possibility of any changes being made to the original data files  International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission; ISO IEC, 2012 . The process of preserving digital evidence will be discussed further in Chapter 13.  Once a copy of the original data is verified, the examination analysis stage,  which refers to data recovery extraction and analysis of digital data, begins. First, manual and automated programs should be used to uncover digital evidence, such as recovering and restoring  hidden,  manipulated,  and  deleted  files.  Once  the  data  has  been  restored,  the digital forensic technician must analyze the digital data to determine its relevance to the investigation  e.g. Rule 401 of the US Federal Rules of Evidence: see Chapter 14 . By the end of the examination analysis phase, the digital forensic technician has reconstructed the  digital  crime  scene.  This  stage  will  be  discussed  further  in  Chapter  13.  After  this reconstruction,  the report presentation stage.  investigation  enters   final  phase:   the  digital   forensic   its   The final phase in the digital forensic investigation is the report presentation stage. Here,  the  findings  that  are  determined  relevant  to  the  investigation  are  finalized  in  a report. How evidence is determined to be relevant to an investigation will be discussed further  in  Chapter  14.  In  addition,  this  report  should  reflect  complete  transparency, meaning each step is described in detail so as to leave no mystery in the digital forensics process.  Specifically,  the  digital  forensic  technicians  should  be  prepared  to  testify  in  504   court  regarding  the  survey identification   e.g.,  chain  of  custody ,  collection acquisition  preservation,  forensic  tools ,  and  examination analysis   data  recovery  and  reduction  stages  of  the  digital  forensic  investigation.  The  report presentation  stage  will  be discussed further in Chapter 13.  In a perfect world, these four stages would be conducted by a trained digital forensic technician  who  is  responsible  for  identifying,  preserving,  analyzing,  and  reporting  the findings  of  the  digital  forensic  investigation.  However,  digital  forensic  training  and certification  is  expensive,  and  many  law  enforcement  departments  do  not  have  the funding or resources available to purchase the necessary forensic equipment. For most law enforcement agencies, it is not plausible to always have a certified digital forensic technician at the scene, just as it is equally implausible for a law enforcement officer to collect  all  potential  sources  of  digital  evidence  to  be  sent  to  an  external  forensic laboratory for examination  Cohen, 2007 . For each tier, there are specially trained law enforcement  officers  who  are  knowledgeable  to  various  extents  in  the  digital  forensic process.  Since  all  law  enforcement  personnel   e.g.,  patrol  officer,  detective   have  the potential to come into contact with digital evidence, “each officer has a role to play in the safeguarding and examination of that material”  Cohen, 2007: 3 .  505   The role of digital evidence  In this Digital Age, technology is inescapable in our daily lives; and those who commit crimes use technology to their advantage. For a crime to be labeled a “computer crime,” the computer must be either the target or tool for committing the crime. In other words, a  hacker  may  target  and  take  down  a  specific  website  whereas  child  pornography consumers use the Internet as a tool for downloading child sex abuse images. However, the  computer  may  also  be incidental  to  a  crime,  meaning  that  the  computer  is  either involved in the commission of a crime, or the computer is being used merely as a storage device   Maras,  2012 .  With  the  globalization  of  technology  and  the  Internet,  there  will continue to be an increase in the abundance of digital devices that need to be analyzed for potential digital evidence. Digital evidence is information that is either transferred or stored in a binary form that is relevant to the crime under investigation  Casey, 2011 .  According to Locard’s Principle of Exchange, when there is contact between two items there is an exchange of material  Locard, 1934 . That is to say, there is an exchange of evidence between the offender and the crime scene – the offender will leave something at  the  scene  of  the  crime   i.e.,  fingerprints   as  well  as  take  something  away  from  the scene  of  the  crime   e.g.,  victim’s  DNA .  Locard’s  Principle  of  Exchange  is  important because  one  of  the  reasons  evidence  is  sought  after  is  to  link  the  people,  places,  and objects involved in the crime. In addition, it is important to obtain evidence in order to provide additional leads, eliminate potential suspects, identify the suspect, corroborate or refute  testimony,  and,  most  importantly,  prove  that  a  crime  has  been  committed, otherwise known as corpus delicti  see Girard, 2011 . Digital evidence may be the “link” between the victim and the offender, just like traditional trace evidence  e.g., hair, fibers, blood  in the other forensic sciences. For example, Philip Markoff, otherwise known as the craigslist killer, was arrested after investigators were able to link the IP address used to send an email to the murder victim to Markoff’s home address  see Hansen, 2013 .  Investigators and examiners try to tell a story – the who, what, when, where, why, and how of a criminal or civil offense. In general, a criminal offense  state and federal  is the violation of a law in which a crime  e.g., murder, rape  is committed against the state, society as a whole, or a member of society. In criminal cases, the plaintiff is either the state or federal government, since the state is representing not only the victim but also  society  as  a  whole.  A  civil offense  is  a  non-criminal  offense,  usually  a  dispute, between private parties  e.g., individuals, organizations, or businesses . In addition, the punishment  in  civil  cases  usually  consists  of  monetary  damages  as  compensation,  as opposed  to  incarceration,  which  can  only  be  imposed  by  criminal  law  violations   see Allen, Kuhns, Swift, Schwartz, and Pardo, 2011 . Digital evidence may play a role in both criminal and civil cases.  Let us first look at the role of digital evidence in a criminal case: State of Florida vs.  506   Casey  Marie  Anthony.  In  2008,  Casey  Anthony  was  charged  with  the  murder  of  her daughter, Caylee Anthony. At the trial, the prosecutor argued that Casey Anthony had used  chloroform  on  her  daughter  before  duct-taping  her  mouth.  A  computer  forensic examiner  testified  that  someone  had  conducted  Internet  searches  using  the  keyword “chloroform” on the home computer  Hayes, 2011 . This digital artifact was determined to  be  relevant  to  the  case,  and  therefore  admissible  as  evidence,  since  it  made  the prosecutor’s argument that Casey Anthony had used chloroform on her daughter more probable.  On  the  stand,  Casey  Anthony’s  mother  claimed  that  she  was  the  one  who  had searched for “chloroform” and that it was an accident, as she had meant to search for “chlorophyll.”  In  a  controversial  verdict,  Casey  Anthony  was  acquitted  of  first-degree murder. After the trial, the Orange County Sheriff’s department admitted to overlooking evidence  of  a  Google  search  for  “fool-proof  suffocation”  methods  the  day  Casey Anthony’s daughter was last seen alive  see Associated Press, 2012 . It is unknown how this  uncaptured  digital  evidence  would  have  otherwise  influenced  the  outcome  of  the Casey Anthony trial.  In  a  cannibalism  trial  in  Germany,  the  digital  forensic  evidence  suggested  that  the victim of a murder was actually a willing participant in his own death  see Davis, 2008; King, 2013 . In 2001, 41-year-old Armin Meiwes posted an Internet ad on the Cannibal Café  forum  for  a  “well-built  18  to  30-year  old  to  be  slaughtered  and  then  consumed.” This  ad  was  answered  by  43-year-old  Bernd-Jurgen  Brandes.  Searches  of  Meiwes’s computer  reviewed  chat  logs  between  the  two  men  before  they  set  their  in-person meeting on March 9, 2001. In one of these chat logs Meiwes stated, “I would rather kill only those who want to be killed”  King, 2013 .  Meiwes  videotaped  the  encounter  with  Brandes.  This  video  suggested  that  Brandes was  a  “voluntary  victim.”  After  killing  Brandes,  Meiwes  consumed  his  flesh  for  ten months  until  police  were  contacted  by  a  college  student  who  saw  advertisements  for more victims on the Internet, including details about the killing. According to the police, Meiwes was involved in several cannibal forums and had been in contact with over 400 people from these Internet forums. In addition, Meiwes had received emails from over 200 people who wanted to be killed and eaten. After a retrial, Meiwes was convicted of murder and sentenced to life. Although this was not a traditional cybercrime case, digital evidence revealed a timeline between when the Cannibal Café ad was posted, the chat logs between Meiwes and Brandes, and the additional Internet postings that eventually led police to the Rotenburg Cannibal  Davis, 2008; King, 2013 .  information  on   For  more  the  Rotenburg  Cannibal,  go  online  www.dailymail.co.uk news article-3439299 I-fried-piece-rump-steak-ate-sprouts- German-cannibal-ate-gay-lover-permission-describes-went-killing-eating-him.html.  to:  507   Next, consider the role of digital evidence in the civil case Berryman-Dages vs. City of Gainesville.  In  2011,  Kim  Berryman-Dages   the  plaintiff   sued  the  City  of  Gainesville, Florida   defendant ,  claiming  she  had  been  adversely  treated  and  demoted  at  work  Gainsville  Fire  Rescue  Service   due  to  her  gender  and  sexual  orientation.  In  2011, Berryman-Dages  subpoenaed  the  computer  of  a  non-party  to  the  case,  Ms.  Thayer, because Ms. Thayer admitted  although later denied  to sending an anonymous letter to the plaintiff criticizing her sexual orientation. Ms. Thayer was married to the Gainesville Fire Rescue Chief at the time this letter was written and at the time of the demotion. The court  ruled  that  Ms.  Thayer  had  to  comply  with  the  subpoena  and  allow  a  computer forensics  expert  to  search  her  personal  computer  for  digital  evidence  of  the  letter  in question  see Berryman-Dages vs. City of Gainesville, 2011 .  Overall,  as  evidenced  by  these  cases,  the  cyberworld  is  not  that  different  from  the physical world. Digital evidence is just as important as physical evidence in criminal and civil cases. Before law enforcement can examine the digital evidence, they must be able to identify which digital devices at a crime scene may contain evidentiary information. Since the advent of the personal computer, the number of people who own computers has increased. According to the United States Census Bureau  2014 , only 8.2 percent of all households had a computer in the home in 1982, compared to 78.9 percent in 2012. Unlike  the  early  years  of  digital  forensics,  identifying  electronic  evidence  has  become more  complicated  for  law  enforcement  officers  due  to  the  advancement  and  increased use of technology in our everyday lives.  508   Types of hardware, peripherals, and electronic evidence  In 2008, the National Institute of Justice released a report entitled Electronic Crime Scene Investigation:  A  Guide  for  First  Responders,  which  was  intended  to  assist  law enforcement with the recognition and collection of electronic evidence. Traditionally, the most  common  form  of  digital  evidence  is  the  computer  system,  which  consists  of hardware, software, and peripheral devices to either input  introduce information to the computer ,  analyze   process ,  or  output   produce display  information  processed  by  the computer  data  Britz, 2009 .  Hardware  is  considered  the  tangible  or  physical  parts  of  a  computer  system   e.g., motherboard .  Software  consists  of  programs  that  include  instructions  which  tell computers  what  to  do   e.g.,  operating  systems .  Peripheral  devices  are  externally connected components that are not considered essential parts of a computer system, such as  scanners,  printers,  and  modems.  As  shown  in  Figure  12.4,  the  size  and  look  of computers have changed dramatically over the years, from large desktop computers  e.g., a legacy system  to personal tablets, including the Apple iPad mini, which weighs only 0.75 pounds  341 grams .  Fig. 12.4 An older model computer A photo of an old IBM Personal Computer XT released in 1983. Source: Wikimedia Commons Bobo11  These outdated computer systems, devices, or software, are often referred to as legacy systems   see  Seacord,  Plakosh,  and  Lewis,  2003 .  For  example,  mainframes  are  509   considered  the  legacy  system  for  the  personal  desktop  computer.  Since  technology  is constantly changing and developing, it may be traditionally easier for law enforcement to  identify  legacy  systems   e.g.,  desktop  computers   compared  to  their  newer counterparts   e.g.,  tablets .  Therefore,  it  is  important  that  law  enforcement  remain vigilant of the trends in technology in order to identify both legacy systems and more current technology.  Along with computer systems, law enforcement officers must be able to identify the various forms of storage device, which include hard drives and removable media  Allen et al., 2011 . First, hard drives are data storage devices used for storing and retrieving data.  Internal  hard  drives  are  installed  inside  the  computer  whereas  external  hard drives  are  portable  storage  devices  located  outside  of  the  computer  and  are  usually connected via a USB port. Internal or external hard drives do not need to be connected to a computer in order for them to have evidentiary value. For example, Ryan Loskarn, ex- chief of staff to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, was charged with possession and distribution of child pornography after the PIS located an external hard drive hidden on the  roof  of  Loskarn’s  home   Marimow,  2013 .  According  to  court  documents, investigators  saw  Mr.  Loskarn  leaning  out  of  a  window  from  the  second  floor  of  his home during the raid. Upon further inspection, investigators found an external Toshiba hard drive on the roof  Marimow, 2013 .  Another form of storage device is the removable media device, which is used to store and share digital information. As shown in Figure 12.5, removable storage devices have evolved  over  the  years  and  include  floppy  disks,  zip  disks,  compact  disks   CDs , CompactFlash card, smart media  SM  cards, and USB flash drives, to name a few.  USB flash drives, or thumb drives, are one of the most common removable storage devices.  They  are  small,  lightweight,  and  can  be  easily  transported  and  concealed.  In addition,  memory  cards,  such  as  the  CompactFlash  card  or  SM  card,  are  small  data storage devices that are commonly associated with digital cameras, mobile phones, video game  consoles,  and  other  handheld  devices   Allen  et  al.,  2011 .  Overall,  data  storage devices  may  contain  a  plethora  of  electronic  evidence,  but  they  may  also  be  more difficult to identify due to their small size and portability.  510   Fig. 12.5 The evolution of removable storage devices Source: Wikimedia Commons Zxb  511   Fig. 12.6 The evolving state of mobile phones The handheld mobile phone has evolved immensely in size and function. Source: Wikimedia Commons Anders  512   Handheld devices are another source of potential electronic information and include mobile  phones,  digital  multimedia  devices   e.g.,  iPod ,  digital  cameras,  and  Global Positioning  Systems  or  GPS   see  Figure  12.6 .  According  to  the  PEW  Internet  Project  Brenner,  2013 ,  91  percent  of  Americans  over  the  age  of  18  have  a  mobile  phone. According to the International Telecommunication Union  ITU, 2013  report, there were as  many  mobile  cellular  subscriptions  as  people  in  the  world.  Handheld  devices  are capable of providing communication  e.g., texting , photography  e.g., built-in camera , navigation   e.g.,  maps ,  entertainment   e.g.,  music ,  and  data  storage   e.g.,  word- processing documents, contacts .  Many  of  these  devices  were  initially  intended  to  perform  a  certain  function;  for example, Apple released the first iPod in 2001 as a portable music storage device. Unless the crime involved copyright infringement, a basic first responder may not necessarily consider  an  iPod  as  a  storage  device  for  electronic  evidence  other  than  music.  Law enforcement and computer forensic technicians should not be fooled by how these tools may be “traditionally” used, as criminals have found other ways to use these handheld digital devices. For example, in 2004, the ringleader of a car theft gang in London was arrested due to the incriminating evidence found on his iPod  see Box 12.4 .  Box 12.4 Digital evidence and real-world crime  iPod car theft ringleader jailed  http:  news.bbc.co.uk 2 hi uk_news england london 3932847.stm.  The gang “hijacked” identities to drive off Jaguars, Mercedes, BMWs and a Porsche, before selling them. The Vehicle Fraud Unit raided the estate and found a mass of incriminating evidence stored on an iPod.  This article provides an in-depth overview of the ways in which digital evidence can demonstrate criminal activity of any sort, whether online or offline. Readers will gather an appreciation for the ways in which digital devices provide a record of individual activity in multiple environments and which may be invaluable for investigators of all crimes.  513   information   Another popular feature of mobile phones and tablet computers is the app, which is a software application typically downloaded by the user that performs a certain function, such  as  gaming,  sharing   pictures ,  communicating,  or  providing entertainment. According to Price and Dahl  2016 , the best iPhone apps of 2016 include Waze, Inbox by Gmail, Cash, Photoshop Fix, and Uber or Lyft. Although many of these apps were designed for a specific purpose, law enforcement has seen many being used nefariously.  For  example,  Words with Friends  is  an  app  that  allows  you  to  play  word games  with  your  friends  by  connecting  via  Facebook  or  inviting  them  to  play.  This game,  however,  also  allows  you  to  play  with  complete  strangers  by  selecting  the “random opponent” option. In addition, this app, and others like it, allows you to chat with the person you are playing against.  In a 2012 Zynga poll surveying more than 118,000 users, 1 out of 10 players admitted to “hooking up” with someone as a direct result of the game Words with Friends  Lynley, 2012 . This chatting feature, however, has become a tool for online predators targeting minors  personal communication, Lt. Dennis McMillian, February 4, 2014 . Words with Friends  is  a  great  example  of  how  a  gaming  app,  which  on  the  surface  may  not  seem relevant  to  a  case,  in  actuality  may  provide  important  information  during  a  digital forensic investigation, such as proof of a prior relationship or chat history.  Not  only  do  some  apps  have  chat  features   e.g.,  Words  with  Friends ,  but  research shows that people are moving away from traditional text messaging to the use of mobile messaging apps designed specifically for chatting, such as Viber  and WhatsApp.  These mobile  messaging  applications  replace  the  short  message  service   SMS ,  which  is  the traditional method of sending short messages or “texts” between mobile devices through your cell phone provider. Mobile messaging applications allow you to send and receive pictures or text messages without paying for SMS.  Some of these mobile apps are considered anonymous and provide privacy online by masking  users’  identities  and  having  messages  that  “self-destruct,”  meaning  they  are only visible for a short period of time  e.g. Snapchat, Whisper,  and Backchat .  Overall, these messenger apps are becoming more popular because of the growing concerns over wiretapping  and  surveillance   i.e.,  recording  phone  conversations  or  reading  text messages:  Vincent,  2014 .  Law  enforcement  and  security  experts  are  aware  that  these mobile  apps  are  well  suited  for  criminal  behaviors,  and  retrieving  digital  information during an investigation will prove to be difficult  Mengle, 2013 .  For more information on the ways in which offenders are using mobile apps, go  online  to:  http:  archive.indianexpress.com news mumbai-police-worried-as- more-criminals-take-to-chat-apps 1144802 .  514   As  previously  discussed,  crimes  increasingly  involve  at  least  one  digital  element  Clifford,  2006 ,  and  any  digital  device,  regardless  of  its  primary  function,  may  be  of evidentiary  value.  For  example,  a  digital  device  may  store  digital  information   emails  that  is  relevant  to  an  investigation  or  be  a  source  of  fingerprints  or  trace  evidence. Digital evidence comes in many shapes and sizes and is no longer limited to traditional desktop computers. Instead, storage devices, handheld devices, video game consoles, and computer  network  devices  should  be  identified  for  their  potential  evidentiary  value during any criminal investigation. Taken as a whole, the identification of digital devices may  be  a  complicated  task  for  law  enforcement  as  technology  continues  to  become smaller, more compact, and in some cases disguised.  515   Evidence integrity  As  noted  above,  the  first  step  of  the  digital  forensic  investigation  involves  the survey identification  of  potential  sources  of  digital  evidence.  Next,  the  importance  of evidence  integrity  will  be  discussed  with  regard  to  forensic  soundness  and authentication. For any crime scene, whether traditional or digital, the evidence must be collected  in  a  manner  that  is  forensically  sound  and  which  preserves  the  evidence’s integrity. Forensic soundness  refers  to  the  validity  of  the  method  for  collecting  and preserving  evidence.  In  digital  forensics,  evidence  is  forensically  sound  when  it  is collected in a way where the data is unaltered, the copied data is an exact duplicate of the  original,  and  the  examiner  documents  every  part  of  the  acquisition  process   see Vacca and Rudolph, 2010 .  Complete  transparency  is  important  in  the  acquisition  of  evidence.  The  digital forensic  technician  is  responsible  for  documenting  which  tools  were  used  during  the forensic examination as well as the date and time of evidence preservation. When the examiner  is  transparent,  it  is  easier  for  the  courts  to  determine  the  validity  of  the process, meaning whether the evidence was collected and preserved in a manner so that an accurate conclusion may be drawn  Slay, Lin, Turnbull, Beckett, and Lin, 2009 . The validity of digital forensics is assessed by whether or not the evidence is admissible in a court of law. The process by which a digital forensics examiner preserves and validates the evidence will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 13. The admissibility standards for evidence in a court of law will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 14. For now, remember that it is not the job of a digital forensic examiner to “prove” a suspect’s guilt or  innocence.  Instead,  the  number  one  priority  of  the  digital  forensic  examiner  is  to maintain evidence integrity, which is the reliability and truthfulness of the evidence.  516   Summary  Overall, virtually every crime will involve some form of digital evidence, and it is up to law  enforcement  to  be  able  to  identify  the  possible  sources  thereof.  However,  digital evidence may be collected from not-so-obvious devices, such as flash drives disguised as a teddy bear or bracelet  see Figure 12.7a b .  Fig. 12.7a and 12.7b Hidden media examples During a search and seizure, law enforcement may not recognize a teddy bear keychain or bracelet as a USB flash drive. 12.7a Source: Wikimedia Commons Olybrius 12.7b Source: Shutterstock astral232  517   With digital devices increasingly being used to target, act as a tool, or provide support for criminal activities, it is important for law enforcement to understand the crime scene in the Digital Age. There is no doubt that technology will continue to evolve, meaning that  law  enforcement  must  be  able  to  react  quickly  to  the  new  and  different  ways  in which  technology  may  be  used  for  nefarious  acts.  For  example,  in  the  near  future hackers could remotely hijack an automobile through its Internet-enabled features, and use it to commit a crime, such as a hit-and-run. Law enforcement agencies would need to be prepared to conduct vehicle system forensics in a sound and systematic fashion to support a criminal charge  see Nilsson and Larson, 2009; Wright, 2011 .  Regardless  of  whether  it  is  a  computer,  mobile  phone,  or  USB  flash  drive,  digital evidence will only be admissible in a court of law if it is collected in a forensically sound manner. The importance of being forensically sound cannot be reiterated enough, since it may be the deciding factor in any court case, especially in our current Digital Age.

If  technology  is  constantly  evolving,  will  law  enforcement  and  judicial legislation  always  be  “one  step  behind”  the  criminal?  Are  there  any crimes that do not leave behind digital evidence?  519   2.  What are some of the problems law enforcement investigators face when  collecting digital evidence from a crime scene?  3.  Garfinkel   2010   argues  that  the  Golden  Age  of  digital  forensics  is nearing  its  end;  what  do  you  think  is  the  next  stage  or  era  of  digital forensics?  4.  Maintaining evidence integrity is one of the most important steps in the digital  forensic  investigation.  Provide  some  examples  of  how  the integrity  of  evidence  can  be  discredited  during  a  digital  forensic investigation. What are some ways in which law enforcement can ensure that  evidence  is  maintained  during  a  digital  forensic investigation?  integrity   520   References  Allen, R. J., Kuhns, R.

Both companies were competing against one another in the industrial belts market, and Bando Chemical Industries hired several former employees of Gates in 1988. Gates believed that two  computer  programs  were  stolen  and  copied  by  the  former  employees,  who  were now  using  the  computer  programs  under  a  different  name.  Gates  sued  for  copyright infringement, embezzlement of trade secrets, and breach of contract   Gates Rubber Co. vs. Bando Chemical Industry, 1996 .  In 1992, the judge granted Gates’s computer forensics expert, Voorhees, access to the defendant’s computer in order to examine whether or not the defendant had maliciously deleted  files  in  an  attempt  to  destroy  evidence.  However,  the  defendant’s  computer forensics  expert,  Wedig,  presented  testimony  that  Voorhees  had  failed  to  maintain  the authenticity  of  the  computer  evidence.  Wedig  stated  that  Voorhees  inappropriately copied a computer program  Norton’s Unerase  directly onto the defendant’s computer, which “obliterated, at random, seven to eight percent of the information which would otherwise  have  been  available  [and]  no  one  can  ever  know  what  items  were overwritten”  Gates Rubber Co. vs. Bando Chemical Industry, 1996 . Wedig argued that by not making an image copy of the hard drive, Voorhees had failed to preserve evidence – and the court agreed. In the ruling, the US District Court of Colorado stated, “a party has  a  duty  to  utilize  the  method  which  would  yield  the  most  complete  and  accurate results”   Gates  Rubber  Co.  vs.  Bando  Chemical  Industry,  1996 .  Essentially,  the  court mandated that all litigants be required to obtain competent computer forensic examiners in order to preserve and authenticate the integrity of the digital evidence.  It is clear from the Gates Rubber Company vs. Bando Chemical Industry  1996  case that some small portion of potential evidence was lost because the plaintiff’s computer forensic  examiner  failed  to  acquire  and  examine  the  defendant’s  computer  hard  drive accurately. As a result of faulty procedures, no one will ever know what 7 to 8 percent of potential evidence was overwritten. By the end of this chapter, you will understand the process  by  which  a  digital  forensics  examiner  preserves  and  authenticates  digital evidence. In addition, you will understand how examiners use forensic tools to assist in the  preservation  and  extraction  of  digital  evidence.  We  will  explore  in  detail  the examination analysis phase of the digital forensics process by describing how and where potential  evidence  may  be  uncovered  from  a  digital  device,  including  the  ability  to recover deleted files. Finally, we will conclude this chapter with a discussion of report objectivity and forensic confirmation bias; after all, the integrity of the report is just as important as the integrity of the evidence itself.  526   Data preservation  Data preservation is the first step toward uncovering digital evidence and occurs during the collection acquisition phase of the digital forensic investigation  see Chapter 12 . The goal of evidence preservation in digital forensics is to make a copy of the original data files for examination in a way that minimizes the possibility of any changes being made to the original data files  ISO IEC, 2012 . Just as in any forensic science  i.e., entomology, pathology , it is important to protect the crime scene in order to preserve the integrity of the evidence. Digital evidence needs to be preserved just like other traditional forms of physical  evidence,  such  as  blood  or  hair   see  Saferstein,  2010 .  However,  what  makes digital forensics unique is the fact that preservation refers specifically to the ability to make a duplicate copy of the original digital evidence.  Consider  the  murder  of  30-year-old  David  Guy  from  southern  England.  On  July  3, 2012, the torso of David Guy, which was wrapped in a pink shower curtain and stuffed in a plastic bin, was found by a group of students on vacation at Portsmouth beach  BBC News,  2013 .  On  July  8,  2012,  David  Hilder  was  charged  with  the  murder  and dismemberment of David Guy. The prosecutor’s key evidence was DNA samples taken from  Hilder’s  cat,  Tinker.  The  pink  shower  curtain  that  wrapped  Guy’s  torso  was covered in cat hair, and the police were able to extract DNA from the cat hair follicles. Tinker’s DNA was then compared to two cat DNA databases at the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory  at  the  University  of  California  in  the  USA  and  Leicester  University’s Department  of  Genetics  in  the  UK.  It  was  determined  that  Tinker  had  an  uncommon DNA type, and this case became the first time that cat DNA was used during a criminal trial in the UK  Bond, 2013 . Hilder was sentenced to life in prison on July 30, 2013.  In  this  example,  the  crime  scene  technicians  preserved  the  cat  hairs  from  the  pink shower  curtain,  which  ultimately  resulted  in  cat  DNA  evidence  linking  Hilder  to  the murder. However, the word preserve in this example does not mean that the crime scene technicians, or even the veterinary geneticists, were able to make a duplicate copy of the cat  hairs.  Instead,  the  crime  scene  technicians  and  geneticists  must  alter   thereby damaging   the  original  cat  hairs  collected  at  the  crime  scene  in  order  to  test  for  DNA evidence.  Overall,  preservation  has  a  different  connotation  depending  on  whether  you are  referring  to  physical  or  digital  evidence.  Digital  forensics  is  unique  in  some  ways when  compared  to  the  other  forensic  sciences,  since  the  forensic  examination  is  not limited to the original digital device. Instead, there are forensic tools capable of making a duplicate,  thereby  preserving  the  original  source  of  digital  evidence.  This  process  is known as imaging.  Imaging  527   Imaging is the initial step in the preservation process of digital evidence. Imaging is the process  of  making  an  exact  copy   bit-by-bit   of  the  original  drive  onto  a  new  digital storage  device   Casey,  2011;  Maras,  2012;  Britz,  2009 .  This  new  digital  storage  device should  be  clean,  meaning  there  is  no  digital  data  present  or  left  over  which  could contaminate  the  imaging  process   Johnson,  2006 .  The  process  of  cleaning  a  digital storage device to ensure that there are no remnants of data present is known as wiping  Wiles,  2007 .  When  imaging  a  drive,  the  digital  forensics  tool  must  be  forensically sound. To be forensically sound, the digital forensics tool must eliminate the possibility of  making  any  changes  to  the  original  data  source   Casey,  2011 .  To  ensure  that  no changes are made to the original data source, a write blocker is used. A write blocker is a  device  that  allows  read-only  access  to  all  accessible  data  on  a  drive,  as  well  as preventing  anything  from  being  written  to  the  original  drive,  which  would  alter  or modify  the  original  evidence   NIST,  2004;  see  Figure  13.1 .  Essentially,  the  imaging system  is  sending  read-only  commands  to  the  drive,  and  not  write  or  modify commands   NIST,  2004 .  There  are  a  number  of  hardware   external   and  software  internal  write blockers on the market  see www.cftt.nist.gov ; although hardware write blockers are often preferred because it is argued that they have a lower failure rate  see Falayleh and Al-Karaki, 2013 . Hardware write blockers are also known as bridges, since the digital evidence is connected to the examiner’s computer through the write blocker  see Figure 13.1; also Wiles, 2007 . Once the original data device is imaged, the next step is  for  the  digital  forensic  examiner  to  determine  whether  or  not  the  original  and duplicate copies are in fact one and the same.  Verification  528   Fig. 13.1a and 13.1b Write blockers A write blocker is a device that allows read-only access to all accessible data on a drive, as well as preventing anything from being written to the original drive, which would alter or modify the original evidence. Figure 13.1a shows an example of a hardware-based write blocker, Tableau T8.  In Figure 13.1b, a suspect’s hard drive is connected to a hardware-based write blocker, which is then connected to the examiner’s laptop.

Verification establishes  the  integrity  of  the  digital  evidence  by  proving  that  the  duplicate  is authentic, meaning a true and unaltered copy of the original data source  Casey, 2011 . Digital forensic investigators verify the duplicate copies by comparing hash algorithm values  e.g., MD5, SHA . A hash algorithm is a set of calculations that takes any amount of data  input  and creates a fixed-length value  output , known as a hash, which acts as a  unique  reference  number  for  the  original  data   Liu,  2011 .  Hash  values  are  fixed  in length and made up of a unique combination of hexadecimal digits  which can be the numbers 0–9 or the letters a–f . These hash values act as digital fingerprints since they are unique to the original data they reference  Liu, 2011 . Hash values play an integral part in the verification of digital evidence because they are extremely sensitive to any changes  in  the  original  data,  even  if  changing  only  one  bit.  The  process  of  creating  a hash value from a variable amount of data is known as hashing.  In order to verify that the original data was preserved during imaging, a hash value is created for the original drive and its image. If the hash values match, the investigator has verified that the original and duplicate copies are one and the same. In other words, the digital  forensic  examiner  can  now  search  the  duplicate  copy  for  digital  evidence  as  if searching the original digital device  e.g., cell phone . If during the imaging process any changes occur to the original drive, the hash values will be different, indicating that the image is not an exact copy of the original drive. Hash values act as a digital fingerprint for  both  electronic  files   e.g.,  images,  documents   and  storage  media   e.g.,  hard  drive . For  example,  the  National  Center  for  Missing  and  Exploited  Children   NCMEC  established the Hash Value Sharing initiative in 2008, which is a constantly updated list of  hash  values  for  known  child  sex  abuse  images videos   see  Chapter  8;  also  Larence,  529   2011 . This list of known hash values is distributed to law enforcement which can cross- check the known hash values with the hash values from their child pornography cases to determine if there are any “new” instances of child sex abuse  i.e., not currently listed by NCMEC .  Currently, the two most common hash algorithms are MD5 and SHA  Casey, 2011 . MD5   Message  Digest  Version  5   is  a  type  of  hashing  algorithm  that  takes  a  large amount of data of arbitrary length  input  and calculates a unique “fingerprint” of this data   known  as  hashing   expressed  as  a  unique  combination  of  digits  and  letters  of  a specified length  output . In this case, an MD5 hash algorithm produces a 128-bit hash value represented in text as a unique string of 32 digits and letters  Casey, 2011; Marcella and Menendez, 2008; Rivest, 1992; see also Box 13.1 .  Box 13.1 An example of how the MD5 algorithm works  An example of how the MD5 algorithm works:  1.  First,  the  MD5  hash  for  the  original  file  is  calculated.  You  will  receive payment  after  you  murder  my  brother.  6b605a8f218ac7923e173c80 82c52845.  2.  Any  exact  copies  of  the  file  will  produce  the  same  MD5  value.  Copy  1: 6b605a8f218ac7923e1  6b605a8f218ac7923e173c8082c52845;  Copy  73c8082c52845.  2:   3.  Should any data in the file change, the MD5 value will change as well. For  example,  Copy  1:  You  will  receive  payment  after  you  murder  my  brother.  6b605a8f218ac7923e173c8082c52845.  Copy  2:  You  will  receive  payment  after  you  murder  my  mother.  21502c8d206b36391a029a7372e87777.  Another  common  hashing  algorithm  is  the  SHA  or  Secure  Hash  Algorithm, originally created by the National Security Agency in 1993. Using a different algorithm, SHA  follows  the  same  basic  principles  as  MD5  in  that  an  arbitrary  amount  of information  can  be  uniquely  represented  by  a  combination  of  hexadecimal  digits, resulting in a “digital fingerprint.” The original version of SHA, known as SHA-0, was a 160-bit  unique  value   Eastlake  and  Jones,  2001 .  However,  the  original  SHA  algorithm was  revised  to  SHA-1  due  to  unspecified  cryptographic  flaws   see  Biham  and  Chen, 2004 , but there are still concerns about the vulnerability of SHA-1 to collision attacks  see Polk, Chen, Turner, and Hoffman, 2011; Wang, Yin, and Yu, 2005 .  In the hashing world, when two different sets of data  input  result in the same hash value   output ,  a collision  has  occurred   Wang,  2012 .  For  example,  a  digital  forensics  530   examiner  collects  two  different  computers  from  a  crime  scene   computers  X  and  Y . Before analyzing the evidence, the examiner images each computer to create a copy  X- copy and Y-copy . The hash values for X and X-copy should match, as should the hash values for Y and Y-copy. However, a collision occurs when hashing a hard drive does not result in a unique “digi-tal fingerprint,” but instead the same hash value is produced  e.g. X-copy and Y-copy have the same hash value .  If  a  collision  occurs,  then  the  digital  forensics  examiner  is  unable  to  verify  and authenticate  the  imaged  drive.  Research  suggests  that  it  is  theoretically  possible  for  a collision to occur with MD5 and SHA-1  see Polk et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2005; Xie and Liu,  2013 .  However,  these  collisions  are  theoretical  and  have  yet  to  occur  in  the  real world,  making  the  MD5  and  SHA-1  hash  algorithms  still  secure  for  digital  evidence authentication  Forte, 2009; Schmitt and Jordaan, 2013; Thompson, 2005; Wang, 2012 . In response to these collision concerns, several additional hash algorithms were created and have been approved for use in the digital verification process by NIST alongside MD5 and SHA-1  i.e., SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512; see Wang, 2012 .  Several  court  cases  have  verified  the  use  of  hash  algorithms  in  digital  forensic investigations. For example, in XPEL Technologies Corporation vs. American Filter Film Distributors  2008 , the judge ordered that all of the images made from the seized digital devices “be authenticated by generating an MD5 hash value verification for comparison to the original hard drive.” In addition, the Third Circuit described the SHA-1 hash value as “more unique to a data file than DNA is to the human body”  United States vs. Beatty, 2011 .  The  courts  have  also  ruled  on  the  degree  of  accuracy  for  the  use  of  hash algorithms in digital forensics. Specifically, in United States vs. Cartier  2008 , the Eighth Circuit  ruled  that  a  “theoretical  possibility”  of  a  collision  is  not  grounds  for  excluding digital evidence authenticated with hash values:  In arguing that the hash values do not establish probable cause for a search warrant, Cartier asserts that it is possible  for  two  digital  files  to  have  hash  values  that  collide  or  overlap.  The  district  court  heard  the  factual evidence presented on the issue of hash values at the suppression hearing. Cartier’s expert testified that hash values could collide and that in laboratory settings these values had done just that. However, the government’s expert  witness  testified  that  no  two  dissimilar  files  will  have  the  same  hash  value.  After  hearing  all  of  the evidence presented by both parties, the district court settled the factual dispute about hash values in favor of the view offered by the government.   p. 5   Overall,  the  imaging  and  verification  process  of  data  preservation  is  extremely important  in  order  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  digital  evidence.  Hash  values  will continue  to  be  used  as  a  means  for  verifying  the  authenticity  of  an  imaged  drive. However, the data preservation process relies on the use of digital forensic tools, many of which  are  dual  purposed  in  that  they  both  image  and  hash  hard  drives   e.g.,  EnCase, FTK . Therefore, data preservation and evidence integrity relies heavily on the validity and reliability of digital forensic tools.  531   Digital forensic imaging tools  During the pre-forensics era of the early 1980s, few forensic tools were available. In fact, only  government  agencies  were  developing  computer  forensic  tools  at  this  time,  and these tools were not made available to other law enforcement agencies or industry  see Chapter 12 . In addition, the courts were concerned with the accuracy of the computer forensics tools. During the 1980s, there were few law enforcement officers “trained” in computer  forensics   i.e.,  most  were  self-declared  experts ,  and  the  forensic  tools  that were  available  were  expensive,  making  the  collection  and  examination  of  computer evidence  either  inaccessible  or  unaffordable  for  most  law  enforcement  agencies. However, by the early 2000s, the forensic industry began to develop tools that allowed for the examination of computer evidence. This surge in forensic tools became known as the Golden Age of digital forensics  Garfinkel, 2010 .  During this Golden Age, it became even more important for law enforcement to verify that  the  digital  forensic  tools  were  producing  reliable  evidence  in  order  to  meet admissibility  standards  in  a  court  of  law   Garfinkel,  2010;  National  Research  Council, 2009; see also Chapter 14 . In response, NIST, an agency of the United States Department of  Commerce,  launched  the  Computer  Forensic  Tool  Testing  project   CFTT . According to NIST, there are approximately 150 different digital forensic tools currently being used by law enforcement worldwide  NIST, n.d. . The purpose of the CFTT project is to “provide unbiased, open, and objective means for manufacturers, law enforcement, and  the  legal  community  to  assess  the  validity  of  tools  used  in  computer  forensics”  NIST, n.d. . In addition, these test results must be repeatable and reproducible, both of which are needed to assess “trueness and precision”  NIST, 2001: 4 .  According  to  NIST   2001:  4 ,  repeatability  is  “where  independent  test  results  are obtained with the same method, on identical test items, in the same laboratory, by the same operator, using the same equipment within short intervals of time.” In other words, the  digital  forensics  tool  replicates  the  same  results  when  using  the  exact  same methodology   i.e.,  exact  duplicate  of  the  testing  process .  On  the  other  hand, reproducibility  is  “where  test  results  are  obtained  with  the  same  method  on  identical test  items  in  different  laboratories  with  different  operators  using  different  equipment”  NIST,  2001:  5 .  Thus,  the  digital  forensic  tool  produces  the  same  results  even  in  a different  testing  environment.  Both  are  necessary  in  order  for  the  tool’s  results  to  be admissible as evidence in a court of law. With over 150 digital forensic tools available, it is  important  that  law  enforcement  choose  those  tools  which  have  been  tested  for repeatability and reproducibility by NIST as well as accepted by the court.  There are a number of both commercial  e.g., EnCase, FTK, WinHex  and open source tools  see http:  opensourceforensics.org  available for digital forensic investigations  see Chapter  12 .  Without  a  doubt,  the  two  most  commonly  used  digital  forensic  tools  are  532   EnCase and FTK. The general acceptance of these two tools by the scientific community was even noted in the court case United States vs. Gaynor  2008 . The defendant in this case was charged with possession and distribution of child pornography. The defendant requested that mirror copies of the seized computer hard drives be made available to his computer forensics examiner. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act  2006; see  also  Box  13.2 ,  however,  prohibited  the  defense  from  obtaining  copies  of  the  child pornography evidence in order to limit distribution of said illicit materials, so long as the defense  has  an  ample  opportunity  to  examine  the  evidence  at  a  government  facility  United States vs. Gaynor, 2008 .  Box 13.2 The Adam Walsh Act  Excerpt from the Adam Walsh Act  2006  – Discovery in child pornography cases. The  in  child pornography:  importance  of  protecting  children  from  repeat  exploitation   A.  The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions today involve images  contained on computer hard drives, computer disks, and related media.  B.  Child  pornography   is  not  entitled  to  protection  under  the  First  Amendment and thus may be prohibited.  C.  The  government  has  a  compelling  State  interest  in  protecting  children from  those  who  sexually  exploit  them,  and  this  interest  extends  to stamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the distribution chain.  D.  Every  instance  of  viewing  images  of  child  pornography  represents  a renewed  violation  of  the  privacy  of  the  victims  and  a  repetition  of  their abuse.  E.  Child pornography constitutes prima facie contraband, and as such should not be distributed to, or copied by, child pornography defendants or their attorneys.  F.  It  is  imperative  to  prohibit  the  reproduction  of  child  pornography  in criminal  cases  so  as  to  avoid  repeated  violation  and  abuse  of  victims,  so long  as  the  government  makes  reasonable  accommodations  for  the inspection, viewing, and examination of such material for the purposes of mounting a criminal defense.  SEC. 504. PREVENTION OF DISTRIBUTION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY USED AS EVIDENCE IN PROSECUTIONS.  Section 3509 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the  following: “PROHIBITION ON REPRODUCTION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.”  1.  In any criminal proceeding, any property or material that constitutes child  533   pornography  shall  remain  in  the  care,  custody,  and  control  of  either  the Government or the court.  2.   A.  Notwithstanding  Rule  16  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Criminal Procedure,  a  court  shall  deny,  in  any  criminal  proceeding,  any request  by  the  defendant  to  copy,  photograph,  duplicate,  or otherwise  reproduce  any  property  or  material  that  constitutes child  pornography,  so  long  as  the  Government  makes  the property or material reasonably available to the defendant.  B.  For the purposes of subparagraph  A , property or material shall be  deemed  to  be  reasonably  available  to  the  defendant  if  the Government provides ample opportunity for inspection, viewing, and  examination  at  a  Government  facility  of  the  property  or material  by  the  defendant,  his  or  her  attorney,  and  any individual  the  defendant  may  seek  to  qualify  to  furnish  expert testimony at trial.  The  defendant  argued  that  the  Adam  Walsh  Act  violated  his  “right  to  adequately prepare  his  defense,  his  right  to  effective  assistance  of  counsel,  and  his  right  to  a  fair trial”   United States vs. Gaynor,  2008 .  The  court  ruled  against  Gaynor  citing  that  the government  had  offered  to  provide  a  computer  that  met  the  minimum  system requirements to run both FTK® and EnCase®. The court cited that EnCase and FTK are the  most  commonly  used  digital  forensic  tools   United  States  vs.  Gaynor,  2008; Leehealey, Lee, and Fountain, 2012 .  EnCase®  EnCase ® is a digital forensics tool created by Guidance Software in 1997  Ambhire and Meshram,  2012 .  Guidance  Software  is  considered  a  world  leader  in  digital  forensics, with clients including government agencies  e.g., United States Department of Justice , law  enforcement   e.g.,  Korean  National  Police,  London  Metropolitan  Police ,  and industry   e.g.,  Microsoft,  Boeing;  Guidance  Software,  n.d. .  According  to  Guidance Software’s website, more than 65 percent of Fortune 100 and 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies  i.e., the largest US companies ranked on gross revenue by Fortune magazine  use EnCase for their digital forensic investigations  Guidance Software, n.d. .  Encase is capable of acquiring data from a variety of digital devices, including smart phones, hard drives, and removable media  e.g., thumb drives . This automated tool can image the drive, without altering its contents, and then verify that the image is an exact copy of the original drive. EnCase is capable of searching the unallocated space as well  534   as locating hidden data and deleted files  Maras, 2012 . As shown in Figure 13.2, EnCase displays a user-friendly Windows interface  Garber, 2001 .  Fig. 13.2 Screenshot of EnCase created by Guidance Software Source: Screenshot courtesy of Marcus Thompson, Law Enforcement Coordinator and Instructor for Purdue University’s Cyber Forensics program  In the USA, the first court case specifically addressing the validity of EnCase was State  Ohio  vs. Cook  2002; Guidance Software, 2003 . The defendant, Brian Cook, was found guilty of child pornography possession after his brother-in-law, Brian Brown, stumbled across a folder on Cook’s computer that contained sexualized images of children. After notifying the Kettering Police Department, a search warrant was executed and the police seized  several  hard  drives,  diskettes,  and  computer  peripheral  devices  from  the  Cook’s residence   State   Ohio   vs.  Cook,  2002 .  According  to  court  documents,  a  Detective Driscoll identified over 14,000 pornographic images from a forensic copy of Cook’s hard drive that was created using the digital forensics tool, EnCase.  At trial, the defendant challenged the “admission of any materials connected with the mirror  image  on  the  basis  that  the  state  did  not  establish  the  reliability  of  the  mirror image”  State  Ohio  vs. Cook, 2002: 8 . The Ohio appellate court upheld the validity of the  EnCase  software  since  Detective  Driscoll  was  trained  to  use  EnCase,  and  he described  the  process  of  imaging  and  verifying  the  duplicate  copy.  The  Court  stated, “there is no doubt that the mirror image was an authentic copy of what was present on the computer’s hard drive”  State  Ohio  vs. Cook, 2002: 9 . International courts, including Singapore,  Australia,  and  Canada,  have  also  upheld  the  validity  of  digital  evidence retrieved by EnCase  Guidance Software, 2003; see also Box 13.3 .  EnCase  has  been  involved  in  a  number  of  high-profile  cases.  In  2002,  San  Diego computer forensic examiners uncovered child pornography after examining 50-year-old David Westerfield’s computer and removable media files using EnCase  McKay, 2002 .

In the present case, there is no doubt that the mirror image was an authentic copy of what was present on the computer’s hard drive. In fact, Cook’s own expert, Brian Fite, testified that he satisified with the way the information was collected. . . What Fite was concerned about instead were events that may have happened before the mirror image was made.  as  a  possible  motive  during  the  trial   Congressional  Record,  2005 ,  and  in  2003  David Westerfield  was  sentenced  to  death  for  the  kidnapping  and  murder  of  7-year-old Danielle Van Dam.

In addition, the international community has accepted digital evidence from EnCase in  both  civil  and  criminal  cases   EC-Council,  2017 .  In  Wales,  EnCase  software uncovered  electronic  evidence  in  the  case  of  Dheej  Keesoondoyal  who  was  an accountant  at  BP Safeway.  He  set  up  a  fictional  company,  Global  Construction  and Electrical Contractors, and created a series of false invoices and authorized payments to the  companies  in  excess  of  £1.5  million   approximately  $1.86  million    WalesOnline,  536   2004 . Keesoondoyal was found guilty and sentenced to four years in prison  Guidance Software, 2014 .

AccessData  was founded  in  1987  and  is  considered  a  pioneer  in  digital  forensics  and  cybersecurity  AccessData,  n.d.a .  Currently,  there  are  more  than  130,000  FTK  users  in  law enforcement,  government,  and  industry  worldwide   AccessData,  n.d.a .  FTK  is  the standard  computer  forensics  tool  used  by  the  United  States  Federal  Bureau  of Investigation  FBI  and the United Kingdom’s Royal Military Police Cyber Crime Centre of the British Army  Leehealey et al., 2012; AccessData, 2013 . Like other digital forensic software, FTK is capable of imaging a hard drive, scanning slack space, and identifying steganography;  however,  it  is  also  capable  of  cracking  passwords  and  decrypting  files  Maras, 2012 .  537   Fig. 13.3 Screenshot of Forensic Toolkit  FTK  created by AccessData Source: Screenshot courtesy of Eric Katz, Law Enforcement Coordinator and Instructor for Purdue University’s Cyber Forensics Laboratory  In its current version, FTK 5 has new capabilities, including a data visualization tool that creates a timeline and visual depiction of the social interactions  e.g., emails  of the person under investigation  AccessData, n.d.b; see also Figure 13.3 .  In  addition,  FTK  5 includes  Explicit  Image  Detection   EID   which  sorts  through  the  images  on  a  digital device  and  flags  the  ones  that  are  more  likely  to  be  child  pornography  by  using algorithms  that  search  for  flesh  tones,  certain  shapes,  and  orientations   AccessData, n.d.b .  This  feature  speeds  up  the  investigation  process  by  allowing  computer  forensic examiners  to  identify  illicit  images  more  quickly.  For  example,  a  one-terabyte   1TB  external hard drive is capable of holding up to a million high-quality photos  the exact number  depends  on  the  camera’s  specifications ,  which  is  a  lot  of  images  to  search through during a digital forensic investigation.  The first court case to establish the validity of Forensic Toolkit was the civil lawsuit Gutman  vs.  Klein   2008 .  During  a  five-year  discovery  period,  the  judge  ordered  the defendant, Zalman Klein, to assist the opposing counsel with locating all of his personal computers. According to court documents, prior to the date that he was to surrender all of his computers to the opposing counsel’s computer forensic examiner, Klein attempted to alter and destroy digital evidence on his laptop. Klein finally turned over his computer to the plaintiff’s computer forensic expert, Douglas Vitale, who noticed that the laptop was “hot to touch and a screw was missing from the hard drive enclosure”  Gutman vs. Klein,  2008 .  Vitale  forensically  imaged  the  defendant’s  computer  using  the  current version of FTK  version 2.2  at that time, and testified that it was an “accepted tool under industry  standards  to  perform  the  imaging  and  create  a  forensic  duplicate  of  the  hard drive”  Leehealey et al., 2012: 10 .  The  forensic  analysis  revealed  a  number  of  large-scale  modifications  to  the  Klein  538   laptop,  including  deleted  files  and  altered  time date  stamps.  In  addition,  the  browser history  revealed  that  the  defendant  had  downloaded  a  file  from  the  Internet  that  was meant  to  overwrite  space  and  erase  data.  During  the  forensic  examination,  Vitale’s computer  battery  malfunctioned  and  saved  the  imaged  hard  drive  as  occurring  on January 1, 2000 instead of the actual date, December 8, 2005. In Gutman vs. Klein  2008 , the defense argued that the inconsistent date suggested that the examiner had failed to authenticate the evidence. The court, however, ruled that since the hashes used by FTK matched and chain of custody was maintained, the evidence was authentic despite the inconsistent  dates   Leehealey  et  al.,  2012 .  Since  the  defendant  destroyed  and  altered evidence, the judge recommended a default judgment, which is an automatic ruling in favor of the plaintiff  Gutman vs. Klein, 2008 .

EnCase  and  FTK  are  both  examples  of  digital  forensic  imaging  tools,  meaning  the tools are designed to make an exact copy of the entire hard drive  bit for bit  so that the investigator  can  examine  the  duplicate  rather  than  the  original  evidence.  To  ensure reliability, NIST established specific criteria, as recommendations, for imaging tools used in digital investigations:  1.  the tool shall make a bit-stream duplicate or an image of an original disk or  partition,  2.  the tool shall not alter the original disk, 3.  the tool shall be able to verify the integrity of a disk image file, 4.  the tool shall log I O errors, and 5.  the tool’s documentation shall be correct   NIST, 2001: 4; see also Lyle, 2003   In  general,  the  digital  imaging  tool  must  be  able  to  make  an  exact  copy   without altering the original  and verify that the duplicate and original copy are exactly the same  e.g., compare hash values . Although not required, NIST recommends that two duplicate copies be made so that one is left undisturbed while the other is considered a “working  539   copy” which is examined during the digital forensic investigation.  However,  sometimes  the  hash  values  for  the  duplicate  and  original  copy  will  not match,  which  is  why  it  is  important  for  the  tool  to  keep  an  I O  error  log.  I O  errors mean  input output  errors,  and  these  errors  are  often  the  result  of  a  bad  sector  on  the hard drive. A sector is the smallest physical storage unit on a computer disk drive and is almost always 512 bytes  Marcella and Menendez, 2008 . Data files are assigned to the different  sectors  by  the  file  system. File systems  are  simply  the  way  in  which  data  is organized  and  retrieved  on  a  computer  drive,  and  each  piece  of  data  is  called  a  file  Bunting, 2008 . Thus, if there is a damaged sector, the imaging tool will not be able to read the data stored in that sector. If the imaging tool is unable to read the sector, then it is  not  possible  to  copy  bit  for  bit  all  of  the  information  on  the  hard  drive   see  Figure 13.4 . Therefore, bad sectors will result in mismatching hash values.  If  the  imaging  tool  maintains  an  error  log  identifying  the  bad  sectors,  it  will  be possible for the examiner to verify that the original and duplicate copy are in fact the same despite the mismatching hash values. It is also important for the imaging tool to document the examination process  e.g., time, action performed . Overall, both EnCase and  FTK  meet  the  NIST  requirements  for  imaging  tools  and  both  have  undergone scrutiny  in  a  court  of  law.  Digital  forensics  tools  are  not  infallible,  however,  so  the examiner  should  always  proceed  with  caution  and  verify  any  spurious  results.  For example, it may be necessary for one digital forensics examiner to repeat the analyses of another examiner in order to verify the findings independently  Casey, 2011 .  540   Fig. 13.4a and 13.4b Diagram of a hard drive, sectors, and clusters The hard disk platter is divided into sectors, which is where the data is stored. The data can be read on good sectors  010101 , but the data on a bad sector cannot be read.  13.4a Source: Wikimedia Commons Zzubnik  13.4b Source: Wikimedia Commons MistWiz  A  Data is stored on circular tracks  B  A disk is divided into pie-shaped sectors  C  A sector of a track  D  The part of a track that contains two or more adjacent sectors form a cluster  541   Uncovering digital evidence  Once  the  digital  drive  is  imaged  and  verified,  the  digital  forensic  investigation  moves into  the  examination analysis  stage.  The  examination  phase  of  the  digital  forensic investigation is concerned with the recovery or extraction of digital data. Data recovery or  extraction  refers  to  the  process  of  salvaging  digital  information   Casey,  2011 .  In general, there are two types of extraction: physical and logical  Britz, 2009; NIJ, 2004 .  The physical extraction phase identifies and recovers data across the entire physical drive  regardless  of  the  file  systems  present  on  the  drive   NIJ,  2004 .  As  mentioned previously, file systems are the way in which data is stored and retrieved on a computer drive, and each piece of data is called a file  Bunting, 2008 . The file system dictates how the  computer  manages  and  keeps  track  of  the  name  and  location  of  every  file  on  a computer  Maras, 2012 . For example, FAT and NTFS are the file systems used by certain Microsoft  Windows  operating  systems   e.g.,  Windows  98,  Windows  XP .  Overall,  a physical extraction pulls all of the digital data from a computer hard drive but does not take  into  account  how  the  data  was  stored  on  the  drive.  On  the  other  hand,  logical extraction  refers  to  the  process  of  identifying  and  recovering  data  based  on  the  file systems present on the computer hard drive  NIJ, 2004 . Each extraction phase involves different methods for acquiring potential digital evidence.  Physical extraction  According  to  the  NIJ   2004 ,  there  are  three  methods  of  physical  extraction:  keyword searching,  file  carving,  and  extraction  of  the  partition  table  and  unused  space  on  the physical drive. When performing a keyword search, the digital forensic examiner is able to look for a word or series of words  i.e., a phrase  in the entire physical drive regardless of the file systems. For example, the examiner may be able to search for a specific name  e.g.,  “Donna  Smith”   to  determine  whether  there  is  any  evidence  that  the  suspect contacted this person. In addition, the digital forensics examiner can conduct a nested search, which is a “search within a search”  see Brown, 2003 . In this case, once all of the data  that  contains  the  name  “Donna  Smith”  is  located,  the  examiner  can  conduct  an additional  keyword  search   e.g.,  “murder  for  hire”   within  that  data,  which  further narrows  the  results.  There  are  several  digital  forensic  tools  and  software  packages available on the market for conducting a keyword search  e.g., Sleuth Kit, Autopsy, FTK: Mishra, 2007; see Figure 13.5 .  File  carving  is  another  physical  extraction  method  for  data  recovery   NIJ,  2004 . According  to  Casey   2011 ,  file carving  is  the  “process  of  searching  for  a  certain  file signature  and  attempting  to  extract  the  associated  data”  without  regard  for  the  file  542   systems   p.  445 .  This  means  extracting  pieces  of  information  from  a  larger  dataset without  taking  into  consideration  how  the  files  were  stored  on  the  computer.  File carving is a great method for recovering files when the file allocation table is corrupt or a  file  has  been  deleted  because  in  both  cases  there  will  no  longer  be  an  entry  in  the directory for that file’s location  Beek, 2011 .  Fig. 13.5 Keyword searching through forensic software Example of keyword search for the last name “Bennett” using the digital forensics software WinHex Source: Screenshot courtesy of Lt Dennis McMillian, the University of Alabama Police Department  Instead of relying on the file system to locate the file, the forensic examiner searches for  fragments  of  the  file  according  to  its  file  signature.  A  file  signature  is  used  to identify  the  content  of  a  file,  which  in  this  case  describes  common  file  headers.  File signatures may be used to locate and salvage deleted files  Casey, 2011 . A header is the first few bytes that mark the beginning of a file, whereas the footer, also known as the trailer, is the last few bytes that mark the end of the file. All files contain a header and usually  a  footer,  whether  they  are  Word  documents  or  JPEG  files   see  Sammes  and Jenkinson,  2000 .  Figure  13.6  contains  a  list  of  common  file  signatures,  also  known  as magic numbers, which can vary greatly in value and length.  543   For  more  information  on  common  www.garykessler.net library file_sigs.html.  file  signatures,  go  online   to:  Fig. 13.6 Common file signatures  Fig. 13.7 File carving Example of file carving using a file header search for “JPEG” with the digital forensics software WinHex Source: Screenshot courtesy of Lt Dennis McMillian, the University of Alabama Police  544   Department  In the file carving process, the digital forensics examiner will first identify a particular header of interest  e.g., FF D8 FF E0  and then locate the footer  e.g., 00 3B  in order to extract  the  information  in  between.  By  extracting  the  information  in  the  middle,  the examiner is essentially carving out a block of data  i.e., a file  from a larger set of raw data. In the example shown in Figure 13.7, the examiner was using the forensics software tool WinHex to search for JPEG headers. Common digital forensics tools capable of file carving include EnCase, FTK, Scalpel, and Foremost  Shaw, 2013 .  The last method of physical extraction is known as partition recovery, which is the process of evaluating the partition table and the unused space on the physical drive  NIJ, 2004 . Evaluating the partition tables is considered a physical extraction method because all partition tables conform to a standard layout regardless of the operating system. First, when a hard drive is installed in a computer, it must be partitioned before it can be used. As discussed in Chapter 12, a hard drive is simply a data storage device for storing and retrieving data. Before you can begin to store information on a hard drive, it must be organized  into  partitions,  which  act  similar  to  storage  bins  in  the  real  world. Partitioning  determines  how  much  space  is  allocated  to  each  storage  bin,  or  partition. Thus, the process of dividing up the hard drive into separate storage spaces, known as partitions, is referred to as partitioning  Marcella and Guillossou, 2012 .  The process of partitioning may be explained by using a house or apartment analogy. An  apartment  or  house  is  similar  to  a  hard  drive  in  that  there  is  a  certain  amount  of space available for storage. The internal space of a dwelling can be divided based on the square  footage  to  create  separate  rooms  that  vary  in  size.  In  this  respect,  a  house  or apartment is essentially partitioned. These separate rooms can then be made to “store” different things, so they act like partitions. For example, a house usually has a designated room space  for  a  kitchen  and  bathroom,  and  we  tend  to  store  cooking  utensils  in  the kitchen  and  toiletries  in  the  bathroom.  Thus,  partitioning  is  really  just  the  process  of creating  individual  or  designated  storage  space   i.e.,  partitions   within  a  larger  storage unit  i.e., physical drive .  At the beginning of the data on each disk is a partition table. The partition table acts as a reference description for how the operating system has divided the hard drive into partitions   Casey,  2011;  Marcella  and  Guillossou,  2012 .  Partition  tables  contain important  information,  such  as  the  sizes  and  locations  of  the  partitions  and  the  file systems  operating  within  each  of  these  partitions  on  the  hard  drive.  These  partition tables can reveal to a digital forensics examiner whether or not space on the hard drive is hidden or contains leftover data from prior partitioning. For example, free space is that portion of the hard drive that has yet to be assigned to a partition  Mandia and Prosise, 2003 .  Partitions  contain  both  allocated  space   i.e.,  written  to   and  unallocated  space  i.e., not written to  on a hard drive, and any non-partitioned space on the hard drive is free  space.  Many  of  the  digital  forensics  software  tools  available  today  automatically identify partitions, which simplifies the partition recovery process for investigators  e.g.,  545   EnCase, FTK, NTFS Recovery, Partition Table Doctor .  more   For  www.symantec.com connect articles maintaining-system-integrity-during- forensics.  information,   online   go   to:  Logical extraction  As  discussed  previously,  logical  extraction  refers  to  the  process  of  identifying  and recovering data based on the file systems present on the computer hard drive  NIJ, 2004 . Unlike  the  physical  extraction  method,  logical  extraction  takes  into  consideration  the operating system  e.g., Windows XP  and file systems  e.g., NTFS  installed on the drive. During logical extraction, data may be retrieved from a variety of sources, such as active files,  deleted  files,  file  slack,  and  unallocated  file  space   NIJ,  2004 .  In  addition,  logical extraction  may  recover  digital  evidence  from  hidden  files,  password-protected  files, encrypted files, and steganography.  Active files  are  existing  files  that  are  currently  available  on  a  hard  drive,  meaning they have not been deleted. On the other hand, a deleted file is a file whose entry has been  removed  from  the  computer’s  file  system   e.g.,  FAT   so  that  this  space  is  now marked as usable again. As noted in Figure 13.4, a sector is the smallest physical storage unit on a computer disk drive, and a cluster is two or more consecutive sectors. It is the job of the computer’s file system to allocate space  i.e., sectors  to store information  see Box 13.4 .  Box 13.4 Example of partition recovery  Ryan Jaye is a child pornography user who stores all of his images and videos on his computer  hard  drive.  In  an  attempt  to  conceal  his  crimes,  Ryan  Jaye  created  two partitions on his 80 GB hard drive so that his day-today non-criminal activity would be separate from his child pornography activity. The hard drive was partitioned so that 60 GB were dedicated to non-criminal activities whereas 20 GB were dedicated to his child pornography collection. Unfortunately for Ryan, law enforcement was  546   well aware of his criminal activity. When Ryan Jaye became suspicious that he had been discovered, he decided to delete the second partition that contained all of the child  pornography.  By  deleting  the  second  partition,  this  space  was  no  longer accounted for by the partition table, and Ryan believed that he had concealed his crimes.  With  an  authorized  warrant  in  hand,  law  enforcement  seized  Ryan  Jaye’s computer in order to conduct a digital forensic investigation. The digital forensics investigator,  Chat  Stellar,  examined  the  imaged  hard  drive  using  digital  forensics software to identify the partition table. However, the partition table revealed only one partition  60 GB , leaving 20 GB of the hard drive unaccounted for. Luckily for law enforcement, when a partition is deleted, the data within that partition remains until it is overwritten. Therefore, since Chat Stellar was able to identity space on the hard  drive  which  was  unaccounted  for,  it  is  likely  that  further  forensic  analysis would be able to recover the deleted partition.  Overall,  understanding  how  a  partition  table  can  reveal  information  about  the layout  of  a  suspect’s  hard  drive  is  extremely  important  as  a  physical  extraction method for uncovering digital evidence.  The  space  allocated  to  these  clusters  is  fixed  in  length  depending  on  the  operating system, but the files saved to these clusters rarely equal the same size of the allocated space. Consider a file that is 800 bytes in size. As previously discussed, a sector usually stores 512 bytes of data. Thus, two sectors would be needed in order to store an 800-byte file. If two consecutive sectors are not available, then the file system must allocate the data  to  another  sector  on  the  drive.  A  file  that  is  stored  in  non-consecutive  sectors  is considered to be fragmented  Marcella and Menendez, 2008 . As with the example, the 800-byte file is smaller than the two sectors allocated to store its data  512 bytes + 512 bytes = 1,024 bytes . Therefore, this leftover space between the end of the file and the end of the last storage unit for that file is known as file slack or slack space  Scientific Working  Groups  on  Digital  Evidence  and  Imaging  Technology,  2011 .  In  other  words, file slack or slack space is the leftover area not used between the current allocated file and the end of the last cluster in which the file is stored. In the current example, there would be 224 bytes of slack space.  As noted earlier, file systems dictate how the computer manages and keeps track of the  name  and  location  of  every  file  on  a  disk.  For  example,  FAT32   File  Allocation Table  is the type of file system used in older versions of Windows operating systems  e.g., Windows 98, Windows ME , whereas NTFS  New Technology File System  is the later  file  system  for  the  Windows  NT  operating  systems   e.g.,  Windows  NT  3.1, Windows  XP;  see  Marcella  and  Menendez,  2008 .  FAT32  identifies  where  on  the  hard drive  a  particular  file  is  stored,  or  which  clusters  have  been  allocated  to  that  file. Compared  to  the  older  versions   e.g.,  FAT12,  FAT16 ,  FAT32  manages  the  space  on  a hard  drive  more  efficiently  by  using  smaller  cluster  sizes,  which  reduces  slack  space  Britz, 2009 .  547   In contrast, NTFS offers better security, since it can restrict access to specific partitions or files on a hard drive, making it more difficult to recover files  Marcella and Menendez, 2008 . However, NTFS creates a Master File Table  MFT , which contains information about all of the files and folders on a drive. The MFT can provide valuable information to  a  forensic  examiner,  including  file  type,  size,  and  the  data time  of  creation  and modification  see Carrier, 2005 .  To  better  understand  sectors,  clusters,  and  file  slack,  consider  the  two-car  garage analogy.  A  two-car  garage  may  be  considered  as  a  cluster  made  up  of  two  separate garages  sectors . In this two-car garage, we can fit different models of vehicles, all of which vary in size. In fact, an individual could choose to store one or two larger vehicles or several smaller vehicles, such as motorcycles or dirt bikes. The space allocated to the two-car garage remains the same; the only thing that changes is what is being stored in the garage. Thus, if an individual can only afford to buy one car, then there will be space left open in the two-car garage. This leftover space is the “file slack” or “slack space” in this analogy.  Intuitively, it makes sense why a digital forensics examiner would be interested in the active  files  and  deleted  files  on  a  hard  drive.  However,  why  would  a  digital  forensic examiner be interested in this leftover space on a hard drive? The file slack can be a rich source  of  information  because  this  leftover  space  does  not  remain  unused.  The computer’s operating system wants to use all available space in a cluster, so it will either write random bits of data  known as padding  or store whatever bits of old data remain in the unused sectors. In general, file slack may be broken down into either RAM slack or drive slack  Barrios and Signori, 2010 .  If there is unused space between the end of the last file and the end of the sector, then the  operating  system  will  store  bits  of  information  from  its  Random Access Memory  RAM . The RAM is considered “working memory” because it stores that part of the data which is currently being used by the computer. In addition, RAM is considered volatile in nature, meaning the data disappears when the computer is powered off  Maras, 2012; see also Box 13.5 . When randomly selected data from RAM is stored in the file slack, it is known as RAM slack  Barrios and Signori, 2010 . In contrast to RAM, RAM slack is not  volatile  since  these  random  bits  of  data  are  written  to  the  hard  drive.  Thus,  it  is possible for RAM slack to contain important information, such as network login names and passwords.  Box 13.5 Data sectors  In  this  example,  the  cluster  contains  four  sectors.  Each  sector  is  able  to  hold  512 bytes of data. Thus, if the file system assigns a data file that is larger than 512 bytes of data, the file will be stored in the consecutive sectors.  Sector 1  Sector 2  Sector 3  Sector 4  Cluster  548    512 bytes    512 bytes    512 bytes    512 bytes   If there is any unused space between the start of the next sector and the end of the cluster, the operating system uses this space as drive slack  by  storing  old  information that was once available on the storage device  Barrios and Signori, 2010 . The operating system does not write any new information to that space, so old information that was once  stored  there  will  remain  until  those  sectors  are  filled  with  new  file  data.  For example, the drive slack could contain fragments of deleted word-processing documents or old emails. Thus file slack is a gold mine of information in digital forensics because it contains either randomly dumped information from the computer’s memory  i.e., RAM slack  or remnants of previously deleted files  i.e., drive slack; see Box 13.6 .  Box 13.6 Slack space  As shown in this example, a data file was stored in Sector 1 and in part of Sector 2. The unused space from the end of the data file to the end of the cluster is known as slack space or file slack. There are two types of slack space: RAM slack and drive slack. The remaining space between the end of the data file and the end of Sector 2 is called RAM slack, and from the beginning of the next sector to the end of the last sector is known as drive slack  see Barrios and Signori, 2010 .  Cluster  Slack space  Data file Sector 1  RAM slack  Sector 2  Drive slack  Sector 3  Drive slack  Sector 4  Data  may  also  be  retrieved  from  unallocated  space  in  the  partitioned  hard  drive during  a  logical  extraction.  Unallocated  space  is  the  unused  portion  of  the  hard  drive that the operating system can write to  Casey, 2011; Mandia and Prosise, 2003 , and may best be thought of as unallocated clusters  Mallery, 2007 . Essentially, unallocated space is  that  part  of  the  hard  drive  which  is  not  currently  storing  any  files,  but  unallocated space is not empty per se. When a file is deleted, the entry in the file system that used to reference the now deleted file is removed so that the operating system is aware that this space is now unallocated. During this process the actual file is not deleted, just the entry in the file system. The “deleted” file, or parts of it, will remain in the unallocated space until it is completely written over by a new file. Therefore, it may be possible to extract information from deleted files that have yet to be overwritten in the unallocated space of a  hard  drive   Mallery,  2007 .  There  are  several  forensic  tools  available  for  logical extraction of the unallocated space of a hard drive, such as WinHex, EnCase, FTK, and DataLifter.  549   For  more  information,  go  online  to:  www.giac.org paper gsec 1020 secure-file- deletion-fact-fiction 102029.  Logical  extraction  may  also  recover  digital  evidence  from  hidden  files,  password- protected files, encrypted files, and steganography. Hidden files are files that have been manipulated in such a way as to conceal the contents of the original file  Britz, 2009 . For example, an individual attempting to hide a file may try to alter the file extension. File extensions are that part of the file’s name that tells the operating system what program to use when you want to open it  Savage and Vogel, 2009 . Common file extensions are .doc   Microsoft  Word  documents ,  .pdf   Adobe  portable  document  format ,  and  .mp3  MP3 audio file .  One  easy  way  to  conceal  or  hide  a  file  is  to  change  the  file  extension  so  that  the operating system will use the wrong program to open the file, resulting in an error. To conceal a Microsoft Word document  .doc , the file extension could be manually changed from .doc to .mp3  MP3 audio file . If someone double-clicks on the file to open it, the operating system will fail to open the file because it treated it as an audio file rather than as a Word document. Since files also contain a file header or signature appearing at the beginning of the file, it identifies the file type to the operating system. File headers may be identified and compared to the file extensions using basic digital forensic tools. Any files with mismatched headers and extensions can then be flagged for further analysis.  According to Casey  2011 , two of the greatest obstacles for digital forensics examiners are  password-protected  and  encrypted  files.  Password-protected files  are  locked  files that  require  a  password  to  gain  access,  which  prevents  other  people  from  opening  or modifying  these  files   Britz,  2009 .  For  password-protected  files,  digital  forensics examiners use specialized cracking dictionaries and software in order to circumvent the protection,  such  as  Access-Data’s  Distributed  Network  Attack   DNA   and  Password Recovery  Toolkit   PRTK:  Casey  2011;  Wiles,  2007 .  However,  it  is  a  time-consuming process to crack passwords.  Similar to password-protected files are encrypted files in that both are concerned with privacy. Encryption is the process of transforming information  plaintext  so that it is no longer legible  ciphertext  by using a mathematical algorithm  Casey, 2011; Kessler, 2000; Sammons, 2012 . In other words, plaintext  i.e., the legible message  is transformed into ciphertext  an illegible message  through the use of a cipher, which is a mathematical  550   formula  algorithm  that uses a set of rules for transforming the message  Kessler, 2000 . Most encryption programs require an access key, which is essentially a password that unlocks the file so that the same algorithm that encrypted the information is now used to decrypt it  see Box 13.7 . By entering the access key, the same algorithm used to encrypt the illegible message  ciphertext  now decrypts it back into the original legible message  plaintext .  Using encryption is not uncommon; it is commonly used by businesses  e.g., banks   and government agencies  e.g., NSA , both of which have vested  Box 13.7 An example of encryption  The plaintext message  original  states, “Hello! Pretty Good Privacy  PGP  is a most widely  used  non-proprietary  email  encryption  program.”  However,  once  the plaintext message is encrypted, it is illegible  cipher text . Notice the subject line is not encrypted. In order to decrypt the message, you will need to enter the access key to unlock the decryption.  551   Fig. 13.8a and 13.8b An example of encryption  interests  in  protecting  privacy.  The  strength  of  encryption  programs  varies,  and sometimes digital forensics examiners can use specialized programs to break encryption. However,  there  are  encryption  programs  that  have  proven  resilient  and  remain unbreakable, leading some countries to consider whether a suspect can be compelled by a court of law to provide the encryption key  see Chapter 14 for more details .  Finally, steganography is the practice of hiding information in such a way that others are  not  aware  that  a  hidden  message  exists   Kessler,  2004 .  Steganography  is  different from encryption because the goal of steganography is secrecy rather than privacy   i.e., hidden data vs. illegible data . The primary purpose of steganography is to hide a secret message  within  a  transport  medium  such  as  an  image  or  video  file.  This  transport medium  is  known  as  a  carrier   Kessler,  2004 .  The  process  of  steganography  involves replacing  bits  of  useless  or  unused  data  in  a  file  with  bits  of  different,  invisible  data. Once  the  carrier  medium  has  the  secret  message  embedded,  it  becomes  the  552   steganography medium,  and  only  those  individuals  with  the  appropriate  knowledge and  software  can  reveal  the  secret  message  hidden  within  the  carrier.  There  are  a number of software programs available for creating steganographic images  see Johnson, n.d. , as well as mobile phone apps.  Steganography may be used to conceal a variety of criminal activities, such as stolen credit card information, child sex abuse images, or terrorist plots. For example, a child pornography user may covertly send child sex abuse images via email by embedding the illicit images within neutral images, such as images of a cat. In this example, the neutral image of the cat is the carrier, and becomes steganography once the child pornography image is embedded within the carrier. There are a range of digital forensic tools available for  detecting  steganography  to  assist  forensic  examiners,  including  ILook  Investigator, Stegdetect, Xsteg, and Foundstone  see Richer, 2003 .  on   For  more  www.washingtonpost.com wp- dyn content article 2010 06 30 AR2010063003108_pf.html.  steganography,   use   the   of   go   online   to:  Overall,  uncovering  digital  evidence  is  a  time-consuming  process  to  ensure  that  all possible  data  is  recovered  using  both  physical  and  logical  extraction  methods.  Not including  active  files,  there  is  a  mountain  of  data  that  can  be  extracted  from  the allocated,  unallocated,  and  free  space  of  a  hard  drive.  Digital  forensics  examiners  not only  extract  data  from  active  files,  but  they  also  recover  data  from  deleted  partitions, hidden files, encrypted files, and file slack. Now that the data has been recovered, the digital  forensics  examiner  must  be  able  to  reconstruct  the  digital  crime  scene.  The process of reconstructing the digital crime scene leads to the analysis phase.  553   Data analysis  The analysis phase of the investigation refers to the interpretation and reconstruction of the digital crime scene  Casey, 2011; NIJ, 2004 . This process is not an easy task due to the large amounts of data uncovered during a digital forensic investigation. For example, a 1-terabyte  1-TB  hard drive is essentially one trillion bytes. As discussed in Chapter 12, a byte is a unit of digital information. Since a computer traditionally uses one byte of space to represent a single character  e.g., a single letter such as “a” , if a single word- processing document holds 5,000 characters per page, then a 1-TB hard drive could hold 220 million pages of text  Baier, 2011 2012 !  In  addition,  if  it  were  possible  to  print  20  sheets  of  text  per  minute,  it  would  take approximately 21 years to print all of the documents on a 1-TB hard drive. If all these printed  pages  could  be  stacked,  it  would  be  over  13  miles  tall   Baier,  2011 2012 . Currently, a 1-TB hard drive costs less than $100, and companies are even manufacturing 1-TB USB flash drives as well as 6-TB hard drives. With so much data, one of the most important steps in the analysis phase of the digital forensic investigation is the filtering and reduction of evidence.  554   Data reduction and filtering  After recovering the data during the examination phase, the next step is data reduction and filtering which occurs during the analysis phase. By reducing the dataset, the digital forensics examiner only interprets those files relevant to the investigation. Filtering may involve removing duplicate files, searching for keywords, or grouping data based on file types  Casey, 2009 . For example, a digital forensics examiner may search for and group together image file types  e.g., JPEG, GIF, BMP  when investigating a child pornography case.  In  addition,  file  hashes  may  be  used  to  eliminate  duplicate  data   Pollitt  and Whitledge, 2006 .  As  discussed  previously,  a  hash  value  is  a  number  generated  by  an  algorithm  to substantiate  the  integrity  of  digital  evidence   Scientific  Working  Groups  on  Digital Evidence  and  Imaging  Technology,  2011 .  However,  a  hash  value  may  also  be  used  to identify  unique  or  duplicate  files.  A  hash  value  can  be  created  for  every  file,  and  is  a unique  number  similar  to  a  digital  fingerprint.  If  two  files  have  the  same  hash  value, then  they  are  duplicates  or  exact  copies  of  one  another,  which  can  be  filtered  out  as nuisance data.  Hash  values  may  also  be  compared  to  datasets  that  contain  known  hash  values  for specific  files,  such  as  illicit  materials   e.g.,  child  pornography ,  steganography,  or proprietary software. For example, HashKeeper, Maresware, and the National Software Reference  Library  are  datasets  designed  to  exclude  “known  to  be  good”  hash  values  Kessler,  2004 .  Specifically,  the  National  Software  Reference  Library   NSRL   is supported by the DHS and NIST  NSRL, n.d. . According to the NSRL, a typical desktop computer  may  contain  between  10,000  and  100,000  files,  so  by  using  a  repository  of known hash values, a forensic examiner can reduce the number of files that need to be manually examined.  The  process  of  filtering  the  dataset  and  removing  non-user-created  files   e.g., operating system, program files  is sometimes referred to as de-NISTing. The term de- NISTing  comes  from  the  fact  that  the  known  hash  values  for  these  noise  files  are maintained  and  published  by  NIST’s  NSRL   see  Waxse,  2013 .  Overall,  filtering  the dataset  for  known  hash  values  not  only  reduces  the  number  of  files  that  need  to  be examined but also increases the efficiency of the investigation  NSRL, n.d. .  The ultimate goal of data reduction and filtering is creating the smallest dataset with the highest potential of containing relevant digital evidence  Casey, 2011 . The criteria for  including  and  excluding  data  are  extremely  important;  otherwise  potential  digital evidence may be discarded or overlooked during the filtering process. The final result of the  examination analysis  phase  is  a  reconstruction  of  the  digital  crime  scene,  so  any disregarded evidence could significantly impact the findings of an investigation.  555   Reporting of findings  The final stage in the digital forensic investigation is the report presentation phase. In the  report presentation  stage,  the  findings  determined  to  be  relevant  to  the investigation are finalized in a report. How evidence is determined to be relevant to an investigation will be discussed further in Chapter 14, and essentially refers to evidence that pertains directly to the facts of a case. Only relevant evidence should be included in the final report, rather than hypothetical or theoretical evidence  see Beebe and Clark, 2005 . In addition, this report should reflect complete transparency, meaning each step is described in detail so as to leave no mystery in the digital forensics process. Specifically, the  digital  forensic  technicians  should  be  prepared  to  testify  in  court  regarding  the survey   identification   e.g.,  chain  of  custody ,  collection acquisition   preservation, forensic  tools ,  and  examination analysis   data  recovery  and  reduction   stages  of  the digital forensic investigation.  Along with transparency, the digital forensic examiner should remain objective when drawing  conclusions  from  the  digital  evidence.  According  to  the  Association  of  Chief Police Officers of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, “a digital forensic practitioner must be aware of their duty of impartiality and that they must communicate both the extent  and  the  limitations  of  the  digital  forensic  evidence”   Williams,  2012:  12 .  All conclusions  made  by  the  examiner  should  be  supported  by  objective  evidence  to  limit confirmation  bias.  Confirmation  bias  is  the  tendency  to  accept  information  that confirms our beliefs while rejecting information that contradicts those beliefs  Goodwin, 2009 .  Human  beings  are  naturally  drawn  to  information  that  matches  our  belief systems, leading people to ignore conflicting information. If a digital forensics examiner believes  that  a  suspect  is  guilty  prior  to  examining  the  evidence,  it  is  plausible  that potential evidence exonerating a suspect may be overlooked or evidence may be labeled as incriminating even when it is not.  For  more  www.huffingtonpost.com jeff-kukucka forensic-evidence_b_3178848.html.  information   evidence,   issues   on   go   of   online   to:  556   Kassin,  Dror,  and  Kukucka   2013   use  the  term  forensic  confirmation  bias  to “summarize  the  class  of  effects  through  which  an  individual’s  preexisting  beliefs, expectations,  motives,  and  situational  context  influence  the  collection,  perception,  and interpretation of evidence during the course of a criminal case”  p. 45 . The authors make a  number  of  proposed  reforms  for  reducing  bias  in  the  forensic  laboratory  and  in  the courtroom.  For  example,  forensic  examiners  should  not  receive  irrelevant  information that  may  taint  their  evaluation  of  the  evidence.  A  digital  forensics  examiner  does  not need to know that the suspect confessed to downloading Internet child pornography. The fact that the suspect confessed should have no bearing on whether evidence is present or absent on a hard drive.  In  addition,  Kassin et al.   2013   recommend  that  an  independent  forensics  examiner verify the findings of the initial examination. This independent forensic examiner should also be completely unaware, or blind, to the conclusions reached by the initial examiner. Finally, the authors conclude that any forensic science education or certification should include training in basic psychology and, more specifically, the influence of confirmation bias  Kassin et al., 2013 . Overall, the final report should reflect not only the integrity of the evidence but also the integrity of the forensic examiner.  557   Summary  This  chapter  began  with  a  review  of  the  case  of  Gates  Rubber  Company  vs.  Bando Chemical Industry  1996  identifying the importance of data preservation. A small error, such as forgetting to use a write blocker or creating a duplicate image, could result in a loss of potential evidence. In addition, the Casey Anthony case is a perfect example of how  uncaptured  data   e.g.,  Google  search  for  “fool-proof  suffocation”  methods   may have  influenced  the  outcome  of  the  trial.  The  Orange  County  Sheriff’s  department admitted  to  overlooking  evidence  of  a  Google  search  for  “fool-proof  suffocation” methods  the  day  Casey  Anthony’s  daughter  was  last  seen  alive   see  Associated  Press, 2012 .  There  are  a  number  of  mistakes  that  can  be  made  during  the  perseveration  and acquisition  phases.  It  is  also  important  to  consider  how  examiner  objectivity  can  be maintained and avoid forensic confirmation bias. If the court questions the integrity of the examiner or the forensic laboratory, evidence may be deemed inadmissible in a court of  law.  The  digital  forensic  investigation  process  is  constantly  under  scrutiny,  and  the validity of digital forensics is assessed by whether or not the evidence is admissible in a court of law.

Provide  two  examples  of  how  confirmation  bias  could  influence  the integrity  of  a  case.

Additional espionage charges were brought against Poulsen for illegal possession of classified government secrets filed after computer tapes were found in a storage locker rented  under  his  name.  He  claimed  the  computer  tapes  were  illegally  obtained,  and therefore could not be used as evidence in the espionage case   United States vs. Poulsen, 1994 .  According  to  court  documents,  Poulsen  rented  a  storage  locker  from  the  Menlo- Atherton Storage Facility in April 1987. Poulsen was 71 days behind in rent and owed the company $155.50 for the storage locker. In January 1988, Menlo mailed a notice to Poulsen  who provided a false address and name on the rental agreement  stating that if the rent were not paid in full within 14 days, Menlo would terminate Poulsen’s right to the storage unit.  the  contents  of  Poulsen’s   In  February  1988,  after  not  receiving  rental  payment  in  full,  the  manager  of  Menlo removed  large  amount  of telecommunications  equipment  and  manuals  that  apparently  belonged  to  Pac-Bell”    United States vs. Poulsen, 1994, para 7 . Since the manager of the storage facility believed the telecommunications equipment was stolen, he contacted the police department and gave the detectives permission to seize all of the contents of Poulsen’s locker.  locker  but  noticed  “a   When PacBell investigators examined the computer tapes, they were found to contain classified military secrets, including “air tasking orders, which list targets that the United States Air Force will attack in the event of hostilities”   United States vs. Poulsen, 1994, para  16 .  Poulsen  filed  a  motion  in  1993  to  suppress  the  computer  evidence  retrieved from the storage unit on the basis that seizing evidence from his storage locker violated his  Fourth  Amendment  right  to  privacy  and  unlawful  search  and  seizure.  The  US government argued that the “renter does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of a rental unit if the rent is not paid”   United States vs. Poulsen, 1994, paras 29–30 .  In 1994, the Ninth Circuit Court for California ruled that the computer evidence tapes were  admissible  and  Poulsen  did  not  have  an  expectation  of  privacy  regarding  the contents of his storage locker. Specifically, the Court agreed that Poulsen’s expectation of privacy for the storage unit was terminated when he failed to pay the full amount of his rent as stated in the signed rental agreement  United States vs. Poulsen,  1994 .  In  1996, Poulsen’s espionage indictment was dropped, but he served five years in prison for the other crimes he committed.  Although  Poulsen  went  on  to  become  the  investigations  editor  for  the  technology magazine Wired, the Court’s ruling in the United States vs. Poulsen  1994  case became  567   an  important  decision  that  affected  his  sentencing.  The  computer  tapes  were  the  sole evidence  for  the  espionage  charges.  If  this  evidence  were  not  admitted,  then  it  would have  substantially  hindered  the  ability  of  the  government  to  bring  charges  against Poulsen. As a result, the admissibility of digital evidence has the ability to significantly impact the outcome of a trial.  This  chapter  highlights  the  legal  issues  surrounding  digital  forensic  evidence  in  the courtroom. The chapter begins by exploring two constitutional rights in the USA often challenged  in  cases  involving  digital  forensic  evidence:  the  right  to  privacy   Fourth Amendment   and  the  right  against  self-incrimination   Fifth  Amendment .  Next,  the standards for admissibility of digital evidence in criminal cases in the USA is examined, along with a brief discussion of some international responses  e.g., the UK, Ireland, India, Canada,  and  the  Philippines   to  issues  that  are  being  faced  globally,  including  key disclosure  laws  and  the  reliability  of  expert  witness  testimony.  The  chapter  concludes with  a  discussion  of  the  admissibility  and  reliability  standards  for  digital  forensic examiners providing expert testimony in the courtroom.  568   Constitutional issues in digital investigations  The United States Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787  Levy, 2001 , and is the highest form of law within the nation. It mandates that all state judges follow federal law when a conflict arises between state and federal law. The first ten amendments of the US Constitution are known as the Bill of Rights and were ratified on December 15, 1791  Levy, 2001 . For an amendment, meaning an addition or alteration, to be made to the  United  States  Constitution,  two-thirds  of  the  members  from  both  the  House  of Representatives  and  the  Senate  must  approve  it  and  three-quarters  of  the  states  must ratify it.  With  that  in  mind,  the  Fourth  Amendment  and  Fifth  Amendment  are  arguably  the most influential to cases involving digital forensics, yet these amendments were written during  a  time  without  concern  for  the  influence  of  digital  technology  on  the  law.  As discussed in Chapter 12, almost every criminal investigation now involves some form of digital  evidence.  Therefore,  the  Constitution  is  constantly  being  reinterpreted  and challenged in this Digital Age of technology. The following section will discuss the legal issues surrounding the Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment as they relate to cases involving digital evidence.  The Fourth Amendment  The Fourth Amendment is often summarized as the right to privacy;  yet  there  is  no explicitly stated “right to privacy” in the United States Constitution or Bill of Rights  del Carmen, 2014 . Instead, the Fourth Amendment limits the government’s ability to search and seize evidence without a warrant. In other words, it prohibits unlawful search and seizure  but  only  applies  to  law  enforcement  officers,  and  not  to  private  individuals  so long  as  they  are  not  acting  as  an  agent  of  the  government   James  and  Nordby,  2009 . Overall, the Fourth Amendment may be viewed as a narrow rather than a general right to privacy  see del Carmen, 2014 . The amendment reads:  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.  Thus,  the  Fourth  Amendment  begins  with  a  clause  protecting  a  person’s  body,  home, and  other  belongings  from  unlawful  search  and  seizure  by  any  government  agency.  It also indicates that probable cause is required in order to issue a warrant. However, the Fourth  Amendment  does  not  explicitly  define  what  constitutes  unlawful  search  and seizure, probable cause, or one’s “effects” or belongings. For example, an estimated 375 million people used paid or free cloud storage services in 2012  Lardinois, 2012 . Cloud  569   storage  is  like  a  virtual  warehouse  where  people  can  store  data  on  a  network   e.g., Dropbox,  iCloud,  and  Google  Drive .  Is  the  data  stored  “in  the  cloud”   e.g.,  pictures stored in Dropbox  considered private and or protected under the Fourth Amendment? These  are  the  types  of  questions  facing  the  courts,  which  must  determine  how  to interpret and apply the Fourth Amendment in this Digital Age.  570   Privacy  Since the right to privacy is not overtly outlined in the Constitution, the courts were left to  decide  when  privacy  was  protected  under  the  Constitution.  One  of  the  most influential cases that defined one’s right to privacy was Katz vs. United States  1967 . In  1965,  Charles  Katz  was  convicted  of  conducting  illegal  gambling  operations  across state lines. Agents from the FBI placed a warrantless wiretap on the public phone booth that Katz was using to conduct his gambling operations, which allowed them to listen only  to  Katz’s  conversations  that  related  to  the  illegal  gambling  operations.  Evidence from  the  warrantless  wiretap  was  used  to  convict  Katz  of  illegal  gambling   see  Figure 14.1 .  Katz  appealed  his  conviction,  arguing  that  the  public  telephone  booth  was  a constitutionally protected area, meaning that the warrantless wiretap violated his Fourth Amendment  right  to  unreasonable  search  and  seizure   Katz  vs.  United  States,  1967 . Therefore, any evidence obtained from the warrantless wiretap should be inadmissible in court. In contrast, the federal agents argued that the evidence was admissible since they did not need a warrant to wiretap a public telephone booth. In 1967, the United States Supreme  Court  ruled  that  the  warrantless  wiretap  violated  Katz’s  Fourth  Amendment right  to  unlawful  search  and  seizure.  Any  evidence  obtained  due  to  the  wiretap  was inadmissible  in  court.  Most  importantly,  the  US  Supreme  Court  ruled  that  Katz  had  a constitutionally  protected  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy   Katz  vs.  United  States, 1967 . As stated in the opinion:  What  [Katz]  sought  to  exclude  when  he  entered  the  booth  [.]  was  the  uninvited  ear.  One  who  occupies  [a telephone booth], shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that his conversation is not being intercepted.  571   Fig. 14.1 A pay phone booth An example of an old pay phone. Although this pay phone is “public,” Katz vs. United States  1967  ruled that a person who enters a phone booth, and closes the door, has a reasonable expectation of privacy. A warrantless wiretap would violate the Fourth Amendment. Source: Shutterstock  Eponaleah  In  the  concurring  opinion,  Justice  Harlan  outlined  two  criteria  for  when  there  is  a reasonable  expectation  of  privacy:  the  person  must  have  exhibited  an  actual expectation  of  privacy,  and  the  expectation  must  be  one  that  society  is  prepared  to recognize  as  reasonable     Katz  vs.  United  States,  1967 .  In  addition,  the  Fourth Amendment  protects  people  and  not  places.  The  question  was  not  whether  the  public phone  booth  was  constitutionally  protected  but  whether  the  person  making  the  phone  572   call had a reasonable expectation of privacy   Katz vs. United States, 1967 . For example, if a person is talking on their cell phone while in a university classroom waiting for class to  start,  they  would  not  be  protected  by  the  Fourth  Amendment  because  it  would  be unreasonable to assume that they have an expectation of privacy if they are conversing in the open where it can easily be overheard by the other students. Based on the Katz vs. United States  1967  ruling, the first part of the Fourth Amendment is often referred to as the reasonableness clause,  meaning  a  search  is  constitutional  if  it  does  not  violate  a person’s reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy  Neubauer and Fradella, 2014 .  573   Search and seizure  As  discussed  previously,  the  second  clause  of  the  Fourth  Amendment  restricts  the government’s  ability  to  search  and  seize  evidence  without  probable  cause  to  issue  a warrant.  The  second  clause  of  the  Fourth  Amendment  is  often  referred  to  as  the warrants  clause,  indicating  that  a  warrant  or  signed  document  issued  by  a  judge  or magistrate  authorizes  a  specific  course  of  action.  The  Fourth  Amendment  refers specifically to a search warrant, which is a signed document by a judge or magistrate authorizing law enforcement to conduct a search  Neubauer and Fradella, 2014 .  A search warrant is different from an arrest warrant, which is a signed document by a  judge  or  magistrate  authorizing  law  enforcement  to  take  the  person  into  custody  Neubauer  and  Fradella,  2014 .  A  search  is  specifically  defined  as  the  “exploration  or examination of an individual’s home, premises, or person to discover things or items that may  be  used  by  the  government  as  evidence  in  a  criminal  proceeding,”  and  seizure  is defined as “the exercise of control by the government over a person or thing because of a violation of the law”  del Carmen, 2014: 195 . Therefore, when law enforcement officers conduct a search and seizure, they are identifying and collecting potential evidence to be used in the court of law.  In United States vs. Jacobsen  1984 , the Supreme Court defined the meaning of search and  seizure.  This  case  involved  a  damaged  cardboard  box  that  exposed  several  bags containing  a  white  powdery  substance.  After  seeing  the  contents  of  the  box,  the employees  of  the  freight  company  contacted  the  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  DEA   to  investigate.  When  an  agent  arrived,  he  tested  the  white  powdery  substance onsite and determined that it was cocaine. Based on the results of the field test, the DEA agent then obtained a warrant to search the address where the box was being shipped. Following  a  sting  operation  on  the  shipping  destination,  Bradley  and  Donna  Jacobsen were  convicted  of  possession  with  intent  to  distribute  cocaine     United  States  vs. Jacobsen,  1982 .  They  appealed  their  conviction,  arguing  that  the  Fourth  Amendment required the DEA agent to obtain a search warrant before testing the white powder. The Supreme Court disagreed and held that the defendants’ Fourth Amendment rights were not violated because the initial invasion of privacy occurred as a result of private action rather than governmental action.  In  addition,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  stated  that  a  search  occurs  when  an “expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable is infringed,” and a  seizure  of  property  occurs  when  there  is  “some  meaningful  interference  with  an individual’s possessory interests in that property”  United States vs. Jacobsen,  1984 .  In this  case,  the  search  and  seizure  was  reasonable  and  did  not  violate  the  defendant’s expectation  of  privacy,  since  the  unsealed,  damaged  box  was  compromised.  The employees  of  the  freight  company  also  opened  the  damaged,  unsealed  box  and  574   discovered the suspicious white powder and then invited the DEA to inspect the contents of the box. Therefore, the warrantless search and seizure was legal, since there was no expectation  of  privacy.  The  conduct  of  the  agent  was  reasonable  given  the  prior knowledge,  shared  by  a  private  third  party,  that  the  box  contained  a  suspicious  white powder   United  States  vs.  Jacobsen,  1984 .  That  is  to  say,  the  agents  can  re-enact  the original private search without violating any expectation of privacy, so long as they do not exceed the scope of the private search  United States vs. Jacobsen, 1984 .  There are three basic requirements for a warrant  see Box 14.1; also Bloom, 2003; del Carmen, 2014; Neubauer and Fradella, 2014 . First, a warrant must be signed by a neutral and  impartial  judge  or  magistrate  who  does  not  have  a  vested  interest  in  whether  the search  warrant  should  be  issued.  Second,  the  Fourth  Amendment  specifically  requires that there must be probable cause, supported by oath and affirmation, to issue a warrant. Probable cause means there must be adequate reasons or justifications, rather than mere suspicion, to conduct a search. According to Brinegar vs. United States  1949 , “probable cause deals with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practice considerations  of  everyday  life  on  which  reasonable  and  prudent  men,  not  legal technicians, act”  p. 175 . In general, to issue a warrant, there must be probable cause to support the belief that both a crime has been committed and that evidence of a crime will be found  see Brinegar vs. United States, 1949 .

Probable cause may be viewed as a standard of proof on a continuum of probability  576   ranging  from  mere  suspicion  to  almost  complete  certainty   del  Carmen,  2014 .  For example, in a criminal case, the prosecution must show the jury and or judge that there is  proof  beyond  all  reasonable  doubt  that  the  person  on  trial  committed  the  crime.  In other words, believing that the defendant probably committed the crime or is most likely guilty  is  not  the  same  thing  as  being  almost  100  percent  certain,  or  in  other  words, beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  This  high  standard  of  proof  makes  it  less  likely  that  an innocent person will be convicted. In contrast, a civil case requires only a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. Essentially, it must be more likely than not that the accused committed whatever acts of which they are accused.  As previously discussed, the Fourth Amendment requires probable cause in order to obtain a search warrant. The probable cause is usually presented as an affidavit, which is a written, or occasionally verbal, statement to which the law enforcement officer has sworn  an  oath  to  the  magistrate  that  the  information  is  true  and  factual   del  Carmen, 2014; Neubauer and Fradella, 2014 . Finally, the warrant must explicitly state what crime was committed, the location to be searched, and the specific items to be seized  Bloom, 2003 . Essentially, warrants should be carefully constructed and detailed so that the law enforcement  officers  executing  the  warrant  can  “identify  the  items  with  reasonable certainty, and are left with no discretion as to which property is to be taken”  Neubauer and Fradella, 2014: 290 . However, there are a number of exceptions to the rule, meaning that not all searches and seizures require a warrant.  577   Exceptions to the rule  In general, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that a warrant is only required if the  search  violates  a  person’s  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy   Illinois  vs.  Andreas, 1983 .  In  addition,  a  warrantless  search  may  be  constitutional  even  if  it  does  violate  a person’s  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy,  so  long  as  it  falls  within  an  established exception to the rule  Illinois vs. Rodriguez, 1990 . There are a number of exceptions to the  warrant  requirement  of  a  search  and  seizure:  search  incident  to  arrest,  consent searches,  motor  vehicle  searches,  border  searches,  open  fields,  plain  view,  and  third- party disclosure, to name a few  see Neubauer and Fradella, 2014 .  For example, a person may be searched and any evidence seized once they have been arrested. The process of searching a person who has been arrested for a crime is known as a search incident to arrest. In United States vs. Robinson  1973 , the court ruled that a search incident to arrest is not only an exception to the warrant requirement, but is also viewed  as  a  reasonable  search  under  the  Fourth  Amendment.  Searches  incidental  to arrest protect officers by allowing them to search for weapons or instruments of escape on  the  arrested  person  as  well  as  to  ensure  that  potential  evidence  is  not  going  to  be destroyed  see United States vs. Robinson, 1973 .  In United States vs. Finley  2007 , the defendant appealed his conviction on possession and intent to distribute methamphetamine, arguing that his Fourth Amendment  rights were violated, since law enforcement conducted a warrantless, post-arrest search of his cell phone, which was retrieved from his pants pocket. The search revealed text messages and  call  records  related  to  narcotics  use  and  trafficking,  which  were  presented  as evidence during his trial. The Fifth Circuit Court ruled that searching the cell phone did not violate Finley’s Fourth Amendment rights, since it occurred post-arrest and the cell phone was retrieved from his pants pocket  i.e., search incident to arrest .  Since  cell  phone  data  can  be  altered  or  changed,  the  officers  were  searching  for potential evidence in order to prevent its destruction  United States vs. Finley, 2007 . In contrast, State vs. Smith  2009  ruled that the warrantless search of a cell phone seized incident to arrest violates the Fourth Amendment when the “search is unnecessary for the safety of law enforcement officers and there are no exigent circumstances”  line 171 . Exigent  circumstances  refer  to  emergency  situations  that  allow  law  enforcement officers  to  conduct  a  warrantless  search  when  they  believe  people  are  in  danger  or potential evidence will be destroyed  see McInnis, 2009 .  The United States Supreme Court, however, recently ruled unanimously in Riley vs. California   2014   that  police  will  not  be  allowed  to  search  cellular  devices  without  a warrant after a person has been arrested  Bekiempis, 2014 . Prior to this decision, there were no specific standards for cell phone seizure. In fact, law enforcement officers were seizing  cell  phones  and  imaging  them  during  traffic  stops  in  some  states.  There  are  578   digital forensic tools available that are portable and allow law enforcement to extract cell phone data  see Figure 14.2 . For example, in 2012, Noe Wuences was pulled over by an Oklahoma  City  police  officer  because  the  license  plate  tag  on  his  car  was  improperly displayed    United  States  vs.  Zaavedra,  2013 .  The  driver  consented  to  a  search  of  the vehicle  and  9.5  pounds  of  methamphetamine  were  found  hidden  inside.  Also  located inside the car were two cell phones.  The  officer  proceeded  to  conduct  a  warrantless  search  of  the  cell  phones  using  a Cellebrite  device,  which  extracted  information  including  contacts,  phone  history,  text messages,  and  pictures.  During  trial,  Wuences  submitted  a  motion  to  suppress  any evidence  retrieved  from  the  cell  phones  because  the  search  violated  his  Fourth Amendment rights  United States vs. Zaavedra, 2013 . Since prior courts ruled that law enforcement  may  search  a  cell  phone  seized  during  a  traffic  stop  so  long  as  there  is probable cause to believe the phone contains evidence of a crime  see United States vs. Garcia-Aleman,  2010 ,  and  recognized  tools  of  the  drug  trade   see  United  States  vs. Oliver,  2004 ,  the  Northern  District  of  Oklahoma  court  ruled  that  Wuences’s  Fourth Amendment rights were not violated.  579   Fig. 14.2 Cellebrite device Cellebrite Universal Forensic Extraction Device  UFED  is a portable device used for forensically extracting data from cell phones.

Now,  cell  phones  are essentially  mini-computers  that  contain  a  lot  more  information  than  mere  phone numbers  and  addresses.  For  example,  the  iPhone  5  is  capable  of  storing  over  8,000 pictures or 800 million words of text  Totenberg, 2014 .  As discussed in Chapter 12, smart phones function similarly to computers in that they allow web browsing, emailing, video conferencing, and a variety of apps for data entry and  editing.  According  to  Professor  Kerr  of  George  Washington  University:  “It’s misleading to even think of them as phones; they are ‘general purpose computers’ that have a bunch of apps, one of which is a telephone function”  Totenberg, 2014, para 8 . As a consequence, the Court stipulated in its ruling that cell phones “with all they contain and all they may reveal, they hold for many Americans the privacies of life”  Bekiempis, 2014 . Thus, police must obtain appropriate warrants prior to conducting a search of a cell phone seized incident to an arrest. In addition, law enforcement may submit a search warrant,  court  order,  or  subpoena  to  a  social  media  provider  in  order  to  obtain  data records   See  Box  14.2;  also  Nelson,  Phillips,  and  Steuart,  2015;  Seigfried-Spellar  and Leshney, 2015 .

The  Canadian  Supreme  Court  concurred  with  this  argument  when  they  ruled  that during a search of any premises, additional court authorization is needed to search any computers or cell phones found onsite  R vs. Vu, 2013 . Thus, law enforcement officers may  seize  computers  or  cell  phones  during  a  search,  but  they  must  obtain  additional court authorization to search the electric devices. In that respect, the Canadian Supreme Court argued that a cell phone or computer was not the same thing as a dresser drawer or filing cabinet. If conducting a legal search of physical property, law enforcement is allowed  to  search  inside  dresser  drawers  and  filing  cabinets,  even  if  the  drawers  are closed. Computers and cell phones are different than filing cabinets; for instance, they may be connected to a network whose data is not technically part of the premises being searched  R vs. Vu, 2013 . As a result, perceptions on the status of cell phones and legal searches are evolving and will continue to evolve over the next few decades.  Other  exceptions  to  the  warrant  requirement  are  the  search  of  open  fields  and  the plain  view  doctrine.  Open  field  searches  do  not  require  a  warrant,  since  an  open  field  i.e., property not adjacent to one’s home, such as fields or water  cannot be considered “persons,  houses,  papers,  or  effects”  as  stated  by  the  Fourth  Amendment   see  United States  vs.  Hester,  1924 .  The  plain  view  doctrine  allows  law  enforcement  officers  to conduct a search and seizure for evidence that may not be in the search warrant but is in plain view and its incriminating nature is immediately apparent. For example, in Horton vs.  California   1990 ,  law  enforcement  executed  a  warrant  for  stolen  property  in  the home of Terry Horton, who was suspected of armed robbery. Although the warrant only authorized  the  search  and  seizure  of  stolen  property,  the  law  enforcement  officer discovered weapons in plain view and seized them as potential evidence related to the armed robberies. The judge ruled that a warrantless seizure of evidence  e.g., weapons , while executing a legal search warrant  e.g., stolen property , does not violate the Fourth Amendment,  since  the  discovery  of  said  evidence  was  in  plain  view   see  Horton  vs. California, 1990 .  There  is  a  current  exception  to  the  plain  view  doctrine.  In  United  States  vs.  Carey  1999 ,  the  defendant  argued  that  his  Fourth  Amendment  rights  were  violated  after  a detective searched for evidence on a computer that was outside the scope of the original warrant.  Patrick  Carey  was  being  investigated  for  possible  sale  and  possession  of  583   cocaine.  After  providing  consent,  the  defendant’s  computers  were  taken  to  the  police station and a warrant was obtained by the officers allowing them to search the files on the  computers  for  “names,  telephone  numbers,  ledger  receipts,  addresses,  and  other documentary evidence pertaining to the sale and distribution of controlled substances”   United States vs. Carey, 1999: 1265–1267 .  While searching the computer, the detective identified a JPEG file that constituted an image  of  child  pornography.  After  finding  this  image,  the  detective  admitted  in  court that he abandoned his search for drug-trafficking evidence in pursuit of evidence related to  child  pornography.  The  detective  spent  approximately  five  hours  downloading  over 200 files in search of child pornography  United States vs. Carey, 1999 . Since the Fourth Amendment requires that a search warrant specify the location and items to be seized, the  defendant  argued  that  the  original  warrant  was  transformed  into  a  “general warrant.”  However,  the  government  argued  that  the  child  pornography  images  fell within the plain view doctrine.  The Tenth Circuit Court rejected the government’s argument, citing the Coolidge vs. New Hampshire  1971  ruling that “the plain view doctrine may not be used to extend a general exploratory search from one object to another until something incriminating at last emerges”  line 466 . In addition, the detective was not seizing the files themselves, but the content within the files. In this case, the content was not in plain view.  The court ruled that the discovery of the first child pornography image was admissible  the initial discovery , while all subsequent images discovered were beyond the scope of the original warrant. As a result, the contents of a computer file are not considered in “plain view,” since they must be opened in order to view them. This case established that when evidence is discovered  e.g., child pornography JPEG  related to a different crime  e.g., child pornography possession  outside the scope of the original warrant  searching for evidence related to drug trafficking , the investigator must stop the search entirely and obtain a new warrant based on the newly discovered evidence.  Finally,  the  role  of  consent  is  one  of  the  most  relevant  exceptions  to  the  warrant requirement.  Fourth  Amendment  rights  may  be  voluntarily  waived,  meaning  a  search without probable cause or a warrant may occur if a person who has authority over the place or items to be searched provides consent  Neubauer and Fradella, 2014 . A consent search is made when an individual gives permission, voluntarily and without deceit, to law  enforcement  to  conduct  a  search.  Problems  arise  when  the  person  providing  the consent is not the same person who is being searched.  Courts  in  the  USA  have  ruled  that  law  enforcement  may  obtain  permission  from third-party  members  so  long  as  they  share  a  common  authority  over  the  place  or property being searched  see Illinois vs. Rodriguez, 1990 . In addition, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrantless search of a premise does not violate the Fourth Amendment if it occurred under the apparent authority principle  del Carmen, 2014 , which states that if  the  police  obtain  consent  to  search  a  premise  from  someone  whom  they reasonably believe  shares  a  common  authority  over  said  premises,  it  does  not  violate  the  Fourth Amendment even if the third-party member did not actually have the authority to give  584   consent.  A  number  of  cases  have  challenged  the  exception  to  the  warrant  requirement  as  a result of third-party consent to search another person’s computer or electronic devices. For  instance,  in  United  States  vs.  Smith   1998 ,  the  defendant,  David  Smith,  was convicted  of  possession  and  distribution  of  child  pornography.  The  case  began  when Cindy  Ushman  contacted  police  and  alleged  that  the  computer  contained  child pornography  images.  The  police  received  consent  from  Cindy  Ushman  to  enter  the premises to search for and seize the defendant’s computer.  The child pornography evidence was retrieved from a computer that was located in the  bedroom  of  Smith’s  house,  which  he  shared  with  Cindy  Ushman  and  her  two daughters. The defendant argued that the evidence was inadmissible, since the search of the computer was conducted illegally because the consent given by Cindy Ushman did not  extend  to  the  bedroom  which  is  where  the  computer  was  kept.  Cindy  Ushman, however, testified that the computer was not password protected, was used by the entire family, and was kept in a common area accessible to other family members. Based on this  information,  the  Supreme  Court  ruled  that  a  roommate  has  the  legal  authority  to provide  consent  to  a  search  and  seizure  of  items  and  spaces  that  are  shared  with  the defendant   United States vs. Smith, 1998 .  Consider  the  following  hypothetical  examples  of  two  college  dormitory  roommates named Kathy and Joelle. If Kathy has permission to use Joelle’s computer. Kathy has a shared common authority over said computer. Kathy would be able to provide consent to  law  enforcement  since  she  has  access  to  Joelle’s  computer.  But  if  Joelle  uses  a password to protect her computer, or locks it away in a desk drawer, and Kathy does not know  the  password  or  have  a  copy  of  the  key,  then  she  no  longer  shares  a  common authority  over  the  computer.  In  this  case,  Kathy  would  be  unable  to  provide  legal consent for law enforcement to search for and seize Joelle’s computer, since it is secured. In general, the courts have ruled that roommates, apartment managers, spouses, and employees employers  may  provide  consent  to  law  enforcement  if  they  have  a  shared authority over the space or objects to be searched  see del Carmen, 2014 . Parents can give  consent  to  search  a  child’s  computer  so  long  as  the  child  is  dependent  on  the parents, meaning the child is a minor and is not paying rent. If the child is a legal adult  over the age of 18 in the USA , parents are not able to provide legal consent to search the child’s room without a warrant so long as the child is paying rent to the parents  see United States vs. Rith, 1999; United States vs. Whitfield, 1991 .  The Fifth Amendment  As discussed in Chapter 13, two of the greatest obstacles for digital forensics examiners are  password-protected  and  encrypted  files   Casey,  2011 .  Password-protected  files  are locked  files  that  require  a  password  to  gain  access,  which  prevents  other  people  from opening or modifying these files  Britz, 2009 . Encryption is the process of transforming  585   text, such as an email, through the use of mathematical algorithms so that it is no longer legible to others  Casey, 2011; Kessler, 2000; Sammons, 2012 . Most encryption programs require an access key, which is essentially a password that unlocks the file so that the same  algorithm  that  encrypted  the  information  can  be  used  to  decrypt  it.  Digital forensics  examiners  can  use  specialized  programs  to  break  encryption  and  crack passwords. There are, however, some encryption and password-protected files that have proven resilient and unbreakable.  Many countries are considering whether a suspect can be compelled by a court of law to  provide  an  encryption  key  or  password.  In  the  USA,  this  becomes  a  specific  Fifth Amendment issue. The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution reads:  No  person  shall  be  held  to  answer  for  a  capital,  or  otherwise  infamous  crime,  unless  on  a  presentment  or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy  of  life  or  limb;  nor  shall  be  compelled  in  any  criminal  case  to  be  a  witness  against  himself,  nor  be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.  In  general,  the  Fifth  Amendment  lists  specific  constitutional  rights  protected  within the  criminal  justice  system   Garcia,  2002 .  First,  a  person  accused  of  a  crime  must  be indicted  by  a  grand jury,  a  group  of  people  who  determine  whether  or  not  there  is enough  evidence  to  formally  charge  the  individual  with  a  crime.  Second,  the  double jeopardy clause states that an individual is protected from being prosecuted or punished twice  for  the  same  crime.  For  example,  in  1995,  OJ  Simpson  was  found  not  guilty  of murdering  his  ex-wife  Nicole  Brown  Simpson  and  her  friend  Ron  Goldman.  Even  if evidence resurfaced that proved OJ Simpson was guilty, the Fifth Amendment states that that he could not be charged and prosecuted twice for the same crime due to the double jeopardy clause  see Box 14.3 .  Next,  the  Fifth  Amendment  protects  criminal  defendants  from  self-incrimination, meaning giving a statement that might expose oneself to punishment for a crime  Garcia, 2002 .  This  section  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  is  known  as  the  self-incrimination  clause. During a trial, the defendant may “plead the Fifth” so that he or she does not have to answer any questions or provide testimony that might be self-incriminating. As a result of Miranda vs. Arizona  1966 , the Fifth Amendment was extended to not only include trial  Box 14.3 Double jeopardy  Double jeopardy: Getting away with murder  Vermont case reignites debate on justice, constitutional rights in America  586   Aug. 4, 2011 By ANN MARIE DORNING  Retrieved   from:   http:  abcnews.go.com US double-jeopardy-  murder story?id=14230469&singlePage=true.  OJ  Simpson  may  be  the  most  famous  name  associated  with  double  jeopardy.  In 1995, Simpson was acquitted in the killing of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and  her  friend  Ron  Goldman.  11  years  later  [.]  Simpson  was  writing  a  book tentatively titled “If I did it” [.] which left people wondering why Simpson could not be re-tried for the murders if he confessed or if new details came to light.  testimony but also statements made while in police custody. In the USA, the police are required to read the suspect his or her Miranda rights before questioning:  You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him or her present with you while you are being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning, if you wish.   Miranda vs. Arizona, 1966   If a suspect waives his or her Miranda rights, then any statements made to the police by the suspect may be used as evidence in a court of law. However, Griffin vs. California  1965  ruled that exercising Fifth Amendment rights to not testify should not be used as evidence of guilt. Essentially, if you decide to “plea the Fifth” and not testify or answer any questions, your silence cannot be used against you as evidence of your guilt.  Fourth, the due process clause states that the government cannot deprive someone of “life,  liberty,  or  property”  without  due  process,  meaning  the  government  must  follow rules  and  procedures  for  conducting  legal  procedures  to  limit  arbitrary  decisions   see Garcia,  2002;  Wasserman,  2004 .  Finally,  the  last  section  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  is referred to as the just compensation clause, and states that any property taken by the government must be for public use and the owner must be fully reimbursed its market value   see  Schultz,  2009 .  Overall,  the  Fifth  Amendment  provides  several  different protections  against  the  federal  government,  but  the  most  relevant  clause  surrounding  587   digital investigations is the right against self-incrimination.  588   Protection against self-incrimination  In order for personal statements to be protected under the Fifth Amendment, they must be compelled, testimonial, and incriminating in nature   Fisher vs. United States,  1976 . Any statements made voluntarily  i.e., not compelled  are not protected under the Fifth Amendment.  In  addition,  the  statement  must  be  testimonial,  meaning  oral  or  written communication, rather than physical evidence  e.g., blood samples, fingerprints; see Doe vs. United States, 1988 . Finally, the Fifth Amendment protects individuals from making statements that are incriminating, meaning statements that imply one’s guilt or provide evidence that may be used against them in a court of law.  This clause becomes extremely important when a suspect is compelled to provide the encryption key or password to an electronic device that may contain incriminating files. For example, in 2007, Sebastien Boucher crossed the Canadian border into the USA and the officers found a laptop computer on the back seat of his car  In re Boucher, 2007 . The officer searched the computer and found approximately 40,000 files that contained child pornography.  After  arresting  Boucher,  the  examiner  identified  a  hard  drive  that  was protected  by  the  encryption  software,  Pretty  Good  Privacy   PGP ,  which  requires  an encryption key or password to unlock the drive  see Chapter 12; In re Boucher, 2007 . In addition,  a  computer  forensics  expert  from  the  United  States  Secret  Service  claimed  it would  take  approximately  two  years  to  break  the  PGP  encryption.  The  grand  jury subpoenaed Boucher for the encryption key to unlock the computer drive. A subpoena is a  court  order  requiring  a  person  to  appear  before  a  grand  jury  or  produce  documents  Neubauer and Fradella, 2014 .  Boucher argued that providing the encryption key violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The United States District Court of Vermont had to determine whether Fifth Amendment privilege applied to this case. First, the Court agreed that the act  of  requesting  a  subpoena  involved  compulsion,  since  it  requires  compliance.  In addition,  the  Court  agreed  that  providing  the  password  would  be  incriminating,  since the government argued that the computer contained child pornography.  The last requirement was the most difficult to determine: whether the communication was considered testimonial. As discussed previously, testimonial refers to non-physical evidence.  Thus,  the  court  acknowledged  that  the  contents   e.g.,  files   of  the  laptop computer were not privileged under the Fifth Amendment. In addition, the prosecutor acknowledged that if Boucher provided the encryption key to the grand jury it would be testimonial   In  re  Boucher,  2007 .  Instead  of  providing  the  password,  the  prosecutor argued that Boucher could simply enter the password into the computer while no one was  observing  or  recording  said  password,  which  would  still  allow  access  to  the  hard drive without violating Boucher’s Fifth Amendment rights  In re Boucher, 2007 .  The  Court  ruled  in  favor  of  Boucher,  stating  that  the  act  of  entering  a  password  or  589   encryption key is testimonial  In re Boucher, 2007 :  Entering a password into a computer implicitly communicates facts. By entering the password Boucher would be disclosing the fact that he knows the password and has control over the files.   p. 9   Essentially, the password is not a physical form of evidence. Compelling Boucher to provide his encryption key was tantamount to having the grand jury require Boucher to “display the contents of his mind to incriminate himself”  In re Boucher, 2007: 16 .  The government appealed and revised the original subpoena in In re Boucher   2009 , stating that they were not specifically seeking the password for the encrypted hard drive. Instead,  they  simply  wanted  Boucher  to  provide  an  unencrypted  version  of  the  hard drive to the grand jury. In this instance, the Court ruled in favor of the prosecutor, since the  law  enforcement  officer  already  knew  that  there  was  child  pornography  on  the computer after Boucher initially opened the hard drive and showed him. They argued that since the government already knew that the drive existed, and the types of files that were  on  the  drive,  Boucher’s  Fifth  Amendment  rights  could  not  be  violated  if  he produced an unencrypted version of the hard drive  In re Boucher, 2009 .  Similar cases have led to contradictory conclusions. For instance, Ramona Fricosu was compelled to provide the encryption key to her Toshiba laptop so that law enforcement could  execute  a  previously  authorized  search  warrant   United States vs. Fricosu,  2012 . During the investigation, the defendant acknowledged that she was the sole owner of the computer  and  that  the  computer  possibly  contained  information  the  authorities  were searching  for.  Based  on  this  evidence,  the  Court  ruled  that  producing  an  unencrypted version  of  the  laptop  did  not  violate  Fricosu’s  Fifth  Amendment  rights,  since  she  had acknowledged to law enforcement that the computer was hers and that it might contain incriminating information  United States vs. Fricosu, 2012 .  The  In  re  Doe   2012   case,  heard  in  the  Eleventh  Circuit  Court,  ruled  that  the government  wrongly  charged  John  Doe  with  contempt  of  court  when  he  refused  to comply with a subpoena compelling him to provide the encryption key to his computer. In  this  case,  the  Court  lacked  independent  evidence  that  the  encrypted  hard  drives contained  incriminating  evidence.  Charging  John  Doe  with  contempt  of  court  for refusing to provide his encryption key violated his Fifth Amendment rights to protection against self-incrimination  In re Doe, 2012 .

There  is  not,  however,  any  specific  key  disclosure  law  in  the USA. A key disclosure law is legislation that mandates a person to provide encryption keys  or  passwords  to  law  enforcement  for  digital  forensic  investigations   see  Westby, 2004 .  In  the  USA,  there  is  an  intense  debate  on  whether  a  third  party,  such  as  the manufacturer, may be ordered by the Court to assist in the decryption and or unlocking of  a  suspect’s  electronic  device   Perez  and  Hume,  2016;  Goel,  2016 .  This  issue  gained national  and  international  attention  as  a  result  of  the  San  Bernardino  shooter  case, which became known as the FBI–Apple encryption dispute. On December 2, 2015, Syed Rizwan  Farook  and  Tashfeen  Malik  shot  and  killed  14  and  wounded  22  in  a  terrorist attack  at  the  Department  of  Health’s  holiday  party  in  San  Bernardino,  California;  the suspects  fled  the  scene  and  were  later  killed  in  a  shoot-out  with  law  enforcement  the same day  see Keneally and Shapiro, 2015 .  During the investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  recovered Farook’s work  phone,  specifically  an  iPhone  5C,  model  A1532;  however,  the  phone  was  locked using  a  four-digit  pin   In  re  Order  Compelling  Apple,  2016 .  On  February  16,  2016, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym ordered Apple to provide three forms of technical assistance:    Allow the government to enter more than ten passcodes without the risk of the data  being  wiped  after  the  tenth  incorrect  try   i.e.,  shut  off  the  auto-erase function .     Automate  the  entry  of  those  passcode  combinations  rather  than  have  to  enter  them manually.     Try  back-to-back  passcode  attempts  without  the  gradually  increasing  delays  between attempts that are currently programmed into the system.  It was not the first time Apple had been ordered to assist the government in unlocking an iPhone, but it was the first time Apple was asked to write and install software on a specific device which would assist the government during investigations  see Thompson and Jaikaran, 2016 . In response, Apple immediately released a statement opposing the judge’s order that same day  see Box 14.4 .  592   Box 14.4 Excerpt from Apple's "Message to Our  Customers"  Full letter available at: www.apple.com customer-letter .  A Message to Our Customers:  The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which  threatens  the  security  of  our  customers.  We  oppose  this  order,  which  has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.  [.] We  have  great  respect  for  the  professionals  at  the  FBI,  and  we  believe  their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.  Specifically,  the  FBI  wants  us  to  make  a  new  version  of  the  iPhone  operating system,  circumventing  several  important  security  features,  and  install  it  on  an iPhone  recovered  during  the  investigation.  In  the  wrong  hands,  this  software  – which  does  not  exist  today  –  would  have  the  potential  to  unlock  any  iPhone  in someone’s physical possession.  The  FBI  may  use  different  words  to  describe  this  tool,  but  make  no  mistake: Building  a  version  of  iOS  that  bypasses  security  in  this  way  would  undeniably create  a  backdoor.  And  while  the  government  may  argue  that  its  use  would  be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.  [.]  A Dangerous Precedent  Rather than asking for legislative action through Congress, the FBI is proposing an unprecedented  use  of  the  All  Writs  Act  of  1789  to  justify  an  expansion  of  its authority.  593   The government would have us remove security features and add new capabilities to the operating system, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock an iPhone by “brute force,” trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer.  The implications of the government’s demands are chilling. If the government can use  the  All  Writs  Act  to  make  it  easier  to  unlock  your  iPhone,  it  would  have  the power  to  reach  into  anyone’s  device  to  capture  their  data.  The  government  could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept  your  messages,  access  your  health  records  or  financial  data,  track  your location,  or  even  access  your  phone’s  microphone  or  camera  without  your knowledge.  Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up  in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government.  We  are  challenging  the  FBI’s  demands  with  the  deepest  respect  for  American democracy and a love of our country. We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications.  While  we  believe  the  FBI’s  intentions  are  good,  it  would  be  wrong  for  the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear  that  this  demand  would  undermine  the  very  freedoms  and  liberty  our government is meant to protect.  Tim Cook, Apple CEO  On  February  19,  2016,  the  United  States  Department  of  Justice  filed  a  motion  to compel  Apple  to  comply  with  the  February  16,  2016  court  order   In re  Government’s Motion to Compel . Apple filed a formal motion opposing the Court’s order  In re Apple Inc’s  Motion  to  Vacate   on  February  25,  2016,  citing  that  it  violated  First  and  Fifth Amendment rights  Benner, Lichtblau, and Wingfield, 2016 .  The  first  hearing  to  settle  the  debate  between  Apple  and  the  Department  of  Justice was  set  for  March  22,  2016.  The  Department  of  Justice  applied  for  a  continuance  on March 2, citing that an outside party demonstrated a possible method for unlocking the iPhone. They claimed they needed time to test this method, and if it worked it would eliminate the need for Apple’s assistance in the case  In re Government’s Ex Parte . On March  28,  the  Department  of  Justice  officially  withdrew  its  legal  action  against  Apple citing that it had been successful in accessing the stored data on Farook’s iPhone and no longer needed Apple’s assistance in the case  In re Government’s Status Report .  The  Department  of  Justice  never  revealed  the  identity  of  the  outside  party,  but  FBI Director  James  Comey  stated  that  the  government  “paid  a  lot”  for  the  tool  – approximately $1.3 million  Barrett, 2016 . Most recently, a lawsuit was filed under the Freedom of Information Act by several news organizations  i.e., Associated Press, USA Today, Vice Media  to compel the FBI to provide information regarding the purchase of the  iPhone  access  tool   News  Organizations  vs.  FBI,  2016 .  Since  the  Department  of Justice dropped its case against Apple, it is unknown how the courts would have ruled.  594   There is no doubt that another case will renew this debate on whether a third party, such as  the  manufacturer,  may  be  ordered  by  the  Court  to  assist  in  the  decryption  and or unlocking of a suspect’s electronic device.

This  law  mandates  key  disclosure  so long as law enforcement obtains signed authorization from a high-ranking official  e.g., judge, chief of police  using a specialized form known as a Section 49 request  Madsen and Banisar, 2000 .  For  more  on  Section  49  requests,  go  online  to:  www.washingtonpost.com wp- dyn content article 2007 10 01 AR2007100100511.html.  In  addition,  the  Australian  Cybercrime  Act  2001  inserted  a  new  section  into  the Crimes  Act  1914  giving  law  enforcement  the  ability  to  compel  a  person  to  provide  all encryption  keys  or  passwords  when  investigating  a  computer-related  crime   James, 2004 .  Failure  to  comply  with  this  law  may  result  in  a  six-month  jail  sentence.  In Malaysia,  the  Communications  and  Multimedia  Act  1998  allows  law  enforcement  595   conducting a search to compel a suspect to provide all encryption keys or passwords in order  to  search  the  computerized  data   The  Commissioner  of  Law  Revision,  2006 . Similar to Australian law, a person in Malaysia who refuses to provide the encryption keys could be fined and or imprisoned for six months.  In India, the punishment is even harsher according to Section 69 of the Information Technology Act of 2008 in that a person may be sentenced to seven years in prison for failure  to  assist  an  agency  with  the  decryption  of  information  or  failure  to  provide information  stored  on  a  computer   Information  Technology   Amendment   Act,  2008 . Although  a  few  countries  have  implemented  key  disclosure  mandates,  there  are  many more  that  have  no  policies  at  all  regarding  lawful  access  to  encrypted  or  password- protected electronic devices  e.g., Argentina, Czech Republic, Greece: see Koops, 2013 .  For  more  on  the  Information  Technology  Act  of  2008,  go  online  to: https:  cc.tifrh.res.in webdata documents events facilities IT_act_2008.pdf.  Overall,  there  are  no  consistent  guidelines  on  how  the  law  should  balance  one’s privilege  against  self-incrimination  and  diminishing  obstruction  of  justice  for  cases involving  encrypted  or  password-protected  digital  devices.  With  the  rise  in  encryption use,  there  is  no  doubt  that  law  enforcement  will  continue  to  face  the  challenge  of overcoming encryption and password-protected devices  see Chapter 13 . However, even if a suspect is compelled to provide the encryption key or password, the evidence derived must still be admissible in a court of law.  596   Admissibility of evidence in court  As  discussed  in  Chapter  13,  it  is  important  for  law  enforcement  to  verify  that  digital forensic tools are producing reliable evidence in order to meet admissibility standards in a court of law  Garfinkel, 2013; National Research Council, 2009 . Digital forensic tools must be able to replicate the same results when using the exact same methodology  i.e., repeatability . In addition, they must be able to yield the same results even in a different testing environment  i.e., reproducibility; see NIST, 2003 . Both are necessary in order for the digital evidence to be admissible in a court of law. In addition, the digital forensic technician  is  responsible  for  documenting  which  tools  were  used  during  the  forensic examination as well as the date and time of evidence preservation.  Digital forensic technicians should be prepared to testify in court regarding all stages of the digital forensic investigation  see Chapter 13 . If the examiner lacks transparency, all  of  these  stages  could  be  scrutinized  in  a  court  of  law.  Transparency  of  the  digital forensics process makes it easier for the courts to determine the validity of the process, and  by  extension  easier  to  determine  whether  the  digital  evidence  is  admissible  in  a court of law.  Admissibility  is  the  process  of  determining  whether  evidence  will  assist  the  fact finders   e.g.,  judge   through  their  decision-making  process.  The  judge  determines whether  the  digital  evidence  is  admissible  in  court  based  on  different  standards  for evaluating the relevance and reliability of the evidence. Evidence is considered relevant when it can make the fact presented in a case more or less probable, and evidence that does not tend to prove or disprove a presented fact in a case is deemed irrelevant, and therefore inadmissible  Federal Rules of Evidence, 2010: 401–402; Neubauer and Fradella, 2014 . Reliability refers to the accuracy of the evidence deemed relevant to a case.  In the USA, the civil case of Lorraine vs. Markel American Insurance Company  2007  established  guidelines  for  assessing  the  admissibility  of  digital  evidence.  Jack  Lorraine and  Beverly  Mack  sued  Markel  American  Insurance  Company  for  damages  that  were covered  by  the  insurance  policy  after  their  yacht  was  struck  by  lightning.  After electronic  evidence  consisting  of  emails  was  ruled  inadmissible,  the  judge  highlighted five evidentiary issues when assessing the admissibility of electronic evidence: relevance, authenticity,  not  hearsay  or  admissible  hearsay,  original  writing  rule,  and  not  duly prejudicial   Lorraine vs. Markel American Insurance Company, 2007 . These issues are addressed  individually  by  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence   FRE ,  which  govern  the admissibility of evidence in federal court proceedings in the USA.  First, FRE 401 defines relevance as the tendency to make the fact being presented in a case  more  or  less  probable.  Second,  authenticity  refers  to  the  ability  to  prove  that  the evidence  is  genuine.  According  to  FRE  901,  “the  proponent  must  produce  evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.” In cases  597   involving digital evidence  e.g., emails, web postings, digital photographs , authenticity is  often  challenged,  since  electronic  evidence  can  easily  be  deleted,  corrupted,  or modified  see Lorraine vs. Markel American Insurance Company, 2007 . Third, hearsay is considered second-hand evidence, meaning it is testimony not based on first-hand or personal knowledge  FRE 801 . Testimony that is hearsay is inadmissible because there is no way to validate its truthfulness.  The fourth consideration is referred to as the original writing rule. According to FRE 1001–1008,  the  original  writing  rule  states  that  the  original  evidence,  rather  than  a duplicate, is generally required unless the duplicate can be authenticated and proven that its contents are the same as the original. The original writing rule is sometimes referred to as the best evidence rule  see Chapter 13 . Finally, FRE 403 states that evidence is not admissible,  even  if  it  is  relevant,  if  it  could  unfairly  bias,  confuse,  or  mislead  the  fact finders  i.e., unfair prejudice; see Box 14.5 .  Box 14.5 An excerpt from the US Federal Rules of  Evidence  United States Federal Rules of Evidence 401–403  Article IV. Relevancy and Its Limits  Rule 401. Definition of "Relevant Evidence"  “Relevant evidence” means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.  Rule 402. Relevant Evidence Generally Admissible; Irrelevant Evidence Inadmissible  All  relevant  evidence  is  admissible,  except  as  otherwise  provided  by  the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.  Rule 403. Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of Time  598   Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed  by  the  danger  of  unfair  prejudice,  confusion  of  the  issues,  or misleading  the  jury,  or  by  considerations  of  undue  delay,  waste  of  time,  or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.  Overall,  Lorraine  vs.  Markel  American  Insurance  Company   2007   outlined  the importance  of  several  legal  issues  when  determining  the  admissibility  of  electronic evidence  in  the  USA.  Other  countries  have  developed  admissibility  standards  for electronic or digital evidence  e.g., Canada, Germany, UK, Philippines; see Bidgoli, 2006; Xue-Guang, 2011 . For example, in 2002, the Supreme Court of the Philippines amended the Philippine  Rules  of  Electronic  Evidence   PREE   to  both  criminal  and  civil  court cases  Supreme Court Resolution, 2002 . The PREE specifically outline the admissibility rules for electronic evidence compared to the Philippine Rules of Evidence  PRE , which is a separate standard for non-electronic evidence. The PREE has similar criteria to the United  States  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  for  assessing  the  admissibility  of  electronic evidence, including the best evidence rule and an authenticity standard.  In India, the Information Technology Act of 2000 was created to specifically address the increased use of technology to commit crimes  see Chapters 3, 5, 6, 9; also Karia and Karia,  2012;  Karia,  Anand,  and  Dhawan,  2015 .  In  response  to  the  Information  Act  of 2000,  other  amendments  occurred  to  existing  statutes,  including  the  Indian  Evidence Act of 1972  Karia et al ., 2015 . The Indian Evidence Act of 1972 was ill equipped for dealing with the increased number of documents that were being saved digitally as well as the presence of meta-data as evidence  Karia et al ., 2015 .  In  2000,  the  Indian  Evidence  Act  was  amended  to  include  the  phrase  “electronic records”  in  the  definition  for  “evidence”   Section  3 ,  and  in  Section  17  the  phrase “electronic  records”  was  included  in  the  definition  of  admission.  However,  it  was  not until the case of Anvar vs. Basheer & Others  2014  when the Supreme Court ruled that electronic records could not be admitted as prima facie evidence without authentication  Karia et al ., 2015 . Essentially, electronic evidence, without a certificate as stated under Section 65B of the Evidence Act, cannot be proved by oral evidence  see Box  14.6 .  In addition, the opinion of the expert under Section 45A of the Evidence Act cannot resort to making such electronic evidence admissible. Overall, the Court recognized that digital evidence  may  be  tampered  with  and  altered,  so  “safeguards  are  taken  to  ensure  the source  and  authenticity”   Anvar  vs.  Basheer  &  Others,  2014:  7 ,  and  according  to Acharya   2014 ,  “Anvar  does  for  India  what  Lorraine  did  for  the  U.S.  federal  courts”  para 23 .  Box 14.6 An excerpt from the Indian Evidence Act of  1972  Section 65A and 65B   599   Section 65A: Special provisions as to evidence relating to electronic record  The contents of electronic records may be proved in accordance with the provisions of section 65B.  Section 65B: Admissibility of electronic records  1.  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this  Act,  any  information contained  in  an  electronic  record  which  is  printed  on  a  paper,  stored, recorded or copied in optical or magnetic media produced by a computer  hereinafter referred to as the computer output  shall be deemed to be also a  document,  if  the  conditions  mentioned  in  this  section  are  satisfied  in relation  to  the  information  and  computer  in  question  and  shall  be admissible in any proceedings, without further proof or production of the original, as evidence of any contents of the original or of any fact stated therein or which direct evidence would be admissible.  2.  The  conditions  referred  to  in  sub-section   1   in  respect  of  a  computer  output shall be the following, namely:  a.  the  computer  output  containing  the  information  was  produced by the computer during the period over which the computer was used regularly to store or process information for the purposes of any activities regularly carried on over that period by the person having lawful control over the use of the computer;  b.  during the said period, information of the kind contained in the electronic record or of the kind from which the information so contained is derived was regularly fed into the computer in the ordinary course of the said activities;  c.  throughout  the  materiel  part  of  the  said  period,  the  computer was operating properly or, if not, then in respect of any period in which  it  was  not  operating  properly  or  was  out  of  operation during  that  part  of  the  period,  was  not  such  as  to  affect  the electronic record or the accuracy of its contents; and  d.  the information contained in the electronic record reproduces or is  derived  from  such  information  fed  into  the  computer  in  the ordinary course of the said activities.  3.  Where over any period, the functions of storing or processing information for  the  purposes  of  any  activities  of  any  regularly  carried  on  over  that period  as  mentioned  in  clause   a   of  sub-section   2   was  regularly performed by computer, whether:  600   a.  by a combination of computers operating over that period; or b.  by different computers operating in succession over that period;  c.  by different combinations of computers operating in succession  or  over that period; or  d.  in any other manner involving the successive operation over that period, in whatever order, of one or more computers and one or more combinations of computers.  All the computers used for that purpose during that period shall be treated for the purposes of this section as constituting a single computer; and references in this section to a computer shall be construed accordingly.  4.  In any proceedings where it is desired to give a statement in evidence by virtue of this section, a certificate doing any of the following things, that is to say,  a.  identifying  the  electronic  record  containing  the  statement  and  describing the manner in which it was produced;  b.  giving such particulars of any device involved in the production of that electronic record as may be appropriate for the purpose of showing that the electronic record was produced by a computer; c.  dealing  with  any  of  the  matters  to  which  the  conditions mentioned in sub-section  2  relate, and purporting to be signed by a person occupying a responsible official position in relation to the operation of the relevant device or the management of the relevant activities  whichever is appropriate  shall be evidence of any matter stated in the certificate; and for the purpose of this sub-section it shall be sufficient for a matter to be stated to the best of the knowledge and belief of the person stating it.  a.  information shall be taken to be supplied to a computer if it is supplied  thereto  in  any  appropriate  form  and  whether  it  is  so supplied  directly  or   with  or  without  human  intervention   by means of any appropriate equipment;  b.  whether  in  the  course  of  activities  carried  on  by  any  official, information  is  supplied  with  a  view  to  its  being  stored  or processed  for  the  purposes  of  those  activities  by  a  computer operated  otherwise  than  in  the  course  of  those  activities,  that  601  5.  For the purposes of this section,   information, if duly supplied to that computer, shall be taken to be supplied to it in the course of those activities;  c.  a  computer  output  shall  be  taken  to  have  been  produced  by  a computer  whether  it  was  produced  by  it  directly  or   with  or without  human  intervention   by  means  of  any  appropriate equipment.  Along with these general admissibility criteria, there are specific standards set for the admissibility of scientific evidence in the USA. Scientific evidence is information derived from the scientific method that is relevant to the facts of a case. The scientific method is a  “process  that  uses  strict  guidelines  to  ensure  careful  and  systemic  collection, organization,  and  analysis  of  information”   Saferstein,  2010:  15 .  The  scientific  method occurs  in  the  following  stages:  observation,  hypothesis,  prediction,  examination,  and conclusion  Casey, 2011; see Figure 14.3 .  Following  the  scientific  method  in  a  digital  forensic  investigation  will  increase  the likelihood  of  the  examiner  coming  to  an  objective,  valid  conclusion  as  to  whether  the relevant findings refute or support the original hypothesis, such as whether a crime was committed.  Fig. 14.3 The scientific method  602   First, the scientific method begins with an observation followed by a question worth investigating. For example, consider the hypothetic case of Jai Max who is suspected of being a child pornography user after his wife overheard a conversation about viewing illicit images on the Internet. Law enforcement officers execute a legal search warrant and  seize  his  laptop  computer.  Based  on  the  facts  of  the  case,  the  digital  forensic examiner may ask whether or not there is evidence of Internet child pornography on the laptop.  Next,  a hypothesis  is  generated,  which  is  a  reasonable  explanation  as  to  what may have occurred or why. In this case, the examiner may hypothesize that Jai Max was surfing the Internet and downloaded child pornography images.  Based  on  the  hypothesis,  a  prediction  is  a  specific  statement  as  to  how  you  will determine  if  your  hypothesis  is  true.  For  example,  the  digital  forensic  examiner  may predict that Internet artifacts  e.g., browser history  and image files  e.g., JPEG  will be found on the suspect’s hard drive. Based on these predictions, the examiner will test the hypothesis by conducting a digital forensic examination and analysis of the imaged hard drive in search of evidence that will either support or refute the hypothesis  see Chapter 13 . This stage is meticulously constructed in order to limit any bias or distortion of the evidence   see  Saferstein,  2010 .  The  final  stage  of  the  scientific  method  is  drawing  a conclusion, which is an overall summary of the findings derived from the examination. This  conclusion  will  either  support  or  refute  the  original  hypothesis  and  should  be objective  and  transparent   see  Chapter  12 .  In  the  hypothetical  case  of  Jai  Max,  the digital  forensic  examiner  will  conclude  whether  or  not  there  is  evidence  of  child pornography use on the suspect’s hard drive.  In the USA, there are traditionally three standards for assessing the admissibility of scientific evidence from expert testimony: Frye, Daubert, and Federal Rules of Evidence 702. Each of these standards will be discussed in greater detail as it pertains to scientific evidence derived from digital forensic investigations.  The Frye standard  In Frye  vs.  United  States   1923 ,  the  defendant,  James  Alphonso  Frye,  appealed  his conviction  of  second-degree  murder  on  the  basis  that  the  defense  wanted  to  provide expert  witness  testimony  on  the  results  of  a  systolic  blood  pressure  deception  test.  In Frye, the technology in question was a precursor to what is commonly referred to as the polygraph or lie detector test. The theory was that the rise in blood pressure is evidence that the person is lying, concealing facts, or guilty of a crime   Frye vs. United States, 1923 .  The  defense  also  offered  to  conduct  the  lie  detector  test  in  the  courtroom. However, the prosecution argued that:  [W]hile  courts  will  go  a  long  way  in  admitting  expert  testimony  deduced  from  a  well-recognized  scientific principle  or  discovery,  the  thing  from  which  the  deduction  is  made  must  be  sufficiently  established  to  have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.   Frye vs. United States, 1923   603   In  its  ruling,  the  District  of  Columbia  Court  of  Appeals  upheld  the  lower  court’s decision that the expert witness’s testimony regarding the results of the lie detector test was  not  admissible.  Therefore,  the Frye  standard  states  that  scientific  evidence  is  only admissible  if  it  is  generally  accepted  as  reliable  by  the  scientific  community   Frye  vs. United States, 1923 .  To  determine  whether  the  evidence  meets  the  Frye  standard,  the  proponent  of  the evidence  would  have  to  present  a  collection  of  experts  to  testify  on  whether  the technique  or  issue  being  presented  is  generally  accepted  by  the  relevant  scientific community  Saferstein, 2010 . Although quickly accepted as the standard for admitting expert  testimony,  legal  scholars  became  concerned  as  to  whether  this  standard  was sufficient or flexible enough to recognize novel or controversial scientific breakthroughs that have not yet gained general acceptance in the scientific community  see Smith and Bace,  2002;  United  States  vs.  Downing,  1985;  Watson  and  Jones,  2013 .  Despite  these concerns, a few state court jurisdictions in the USA still adhere to the Frye standard of scientific evidence  e.g., Alabama, California, Illinois . However, Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence replaced the Frye standard in the federal and some state jurisdictions.  604   Federal Rules of Evidence 702  Created in 1975, Article VII of the Federal Rules of Evidence outlined specific guidelines for the admissibility of expert witnesses’ testimony in Rule 702. The original version of FRE Rule 702 stated:  [I]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to  determine  a  fact  in  issue,  a  witness  qualified  as  an  expert  by  knowledge,  skill,  experience,  training,  or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.  In the USA, Rule 702 superseded the Frye standard at the federal level  Mar-sico, 2005 . Many state jurisdictions were confused as to whether this standard was an addition to or replacement of the Frye standard. In addition, the original FRE 702 standard was rather ambiguous as to how the Court was to determine whether someone was qualified to be an expert witness. In 1993, the debate on the admissibility standard for scientific expert witness  testimony  all  changed  with  the  landmark  case  Daubert  vs.  Merrell  Dow Pharmaceuticals.  The Daubert standard  In  1993,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  ruled  on  a  case  where  the  plaintiffs,  two minors  and  their  parents,  sued  Merrell  Dow  Pharmaceuticals  claiming  that  the  drug Benedictine caused the children’s birth defects, since it was ingested during pregnancy by  the  mothers     Daubert  vs.  Merrell  Dow  Pharmaceuticals,  1993 .  The  case  was eventually  heard  by  the  United  States  Supreme  Court.  Both  sides  presented  expert witness testimony. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals presented an expert’s affidavit, which summarized the published scientific literature and concluded that the drug did not have a  history  of  causing  human  birth  defects.  This  expert  witness  testimony  was  ruled admissible by the court.  When  the  plaintiffs  presented  eight  experts  who  testified  that  the  drugs  did  in  fact cause  birth  defects  in  animal  research,  the  court  ruled  that  this  evidence  was inadmissible because it did not meet the FRE 702 standards for admissibility. Specifically, the  United  States  Supreme  Court  ruled,  “general  acceptance  is  not  necessary precondition  to  the  admissibility  of  scientific  evidence  under  the  Federal  Rules  of Evidence”  Daubert vs. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 1993 .  In  addition,  Daubert  vs.  Merrell  Dow  Pharmaceuticals   1993   held  that  any scientific  expert  testimony  presented  in  federal  court  undergo  a  reliability  test.  This reliability  test  is  an  independent  judicial  assessment  which  is  determined  by  the  trial judge, and is known as a Daubert hearing. The Supreme Court’s intention through this test was to end the “battle of the experts.” In addition, the US Supreme Court stated that  605   the Federal Rules of Evidence imply that the judge acts as a gatekeeper,  meaning  the person  responsible  for  assessing  both  the  relevancy  and  reliability  of  the  scientific evidence.  In  other  words,  “the  responsibility  of  a  judge  in  a  Daubert  hearing  is  to determine whether the underlying methodology and techniques that have been used to isolate the evidence are sound, and whether as a result, the evidence reliable”  Watson and Jones, 2013 . By acting as a gatekeeper, the trial judge is responsible for keeping junk science out of the courtroom.  Daubert  vs.  Merrell  Dow  Pharmaceuticals   1993   suggested  four  criteria  for determining  whether  the  relevant  scientific  evidence,  theory,  or  study  is  reliable,  and therefore admissible, in court:  1.  Testing: Has the theory or technique been empirically tested? 2.  Publication:  Has  the  theory  or  technique  been  subjected  to  peer  review  and  publication?  3.  Error rate: What is the known or potential rate of error? 4.  Acceptance:  Has  the  theory  or  technique  been  generally  accepted  within  the  relevant scientific community?  These  criteria  for  determining  the  reliability  and  admissibility  of  scientific  evidence In  the  Daubert  vs.  Merrell  Dow became  known  as  the  Daubert  standard.  Pharmaceuticals  1993  ruling, the Supreme Court did not specify whether some or all of these criteria are required in order for the scientific evidence to be admissible in court. Instead,  it  is  up  to  the  trial  judge  to  determine  which  criteria  are  applicable  to  the scientific technique, theory, or study being examined at the Daubert hearing.  Initially, the Daubert standard only applied to scientific evidence. However, in 1997, the court ruled in General Electric vs. Joiner  1997   that  not  only  was  the  scientific evidence itself under review but the methodology and reliability of an expert’s reasoning process are also vulnerable to scrutiny under Daubert. The court has judicial discretion when determining if “there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the  opinion  proffered”  for  it  to  be  admissible  as  scientific  evidence  in  court   General Electric vs. Joiner, 1997 .  In  1999,  the  Daubert  standard  was  extended  to  all  expert  testimony  that  involves scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge in Kumho Tire Co. vs. Carmichael  1999 . In this case, the judge stated that since Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence does  not  make  a  distinction  between  “scientific,  technical,  and  other  specialized knowledge,”  then  the  Daubert  standard  applies  to  each  of  these  expert  disciplines  to assess  reliability  and  admissibility.  Overall,  the  current  interpretation  of  the  Daubert standard  is  really  a  summary  of  these  three  cases,  namely  Daubert  vs.  Merrell  Dow Pharmaceuticals   1993 , General  Electric  Co.  vs.  Joiner   1997 ,  and  Kumho  Tire  Co.  vs. Carmichael   1999 ,  which  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  Daubert  trilogy   Berger, 2000 .  In  2000,  Rule  702  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  was  amended  to  include  the  606   Daubert  standard  for  determining  the  reliability  and  admissibility  of  expert  witness testimony. In its most recent version, amended in 2011, Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence  now  states  that  a  witness  who  is  qualified  as  an  expert  by  knowledge,  skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:  a.  the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the  trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;  b.  the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; c.  the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and d.  the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the  case.  Overall,  in  the  USA,  the Daubert  standard  has  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  way expert witness testimony is evaluated in the federal courtroom, as well as in most states. However, some states still apply the Frye standard or have adopted a standard of their own. Regardless, the field of digital forensics must be prepared to be scrutinized in the courtroom.  International response to Daubert and Frye  The Daubert and Frye standards have spurred international recognition for the need to keep junk science out of the courtroom. According to the Law Reform Commission of Ireland  2008 , the legal reform in the USA  i.e. Frye and Daubert   has been the “main catalyst for reform internationally [.] for developing admissibility criteria based on the reliability  of  evidence”   pp.  104–105 .  The  Law  Reform  Commission  of  Ireland  is  an independent statutory body established by the Law Reform Commission Act of 1975. The primary  role  of  the  Law  Reform  Commission  is  to  review  and  conduct  research  to determine whether the law needs to be revised or simplified, and, specifically, one of the Law  Reform  Commission’s  projects  was  to  evaluate  the  standards  and  procedures  for evaluating scientific evidence  Law Reform Commission, 2008 .  In 2008, the Consultation Paper on Expert Evidence was released by the Law Reform Commission.  In  this  report,  the  Commission  summarized  the  case  law  from  several countries that appeared to be moving toward a Daubert -like standard for assessing the reliability of expert witness testimony  e.g., Australia, England and Wales . The report also  weighed  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  implementing  a  reliability  test  for Irish  courts  similar  to  the  Daubert  standard  in  the  USA.  Overall,  the  Law  Reform Commission  recommended  that  Ireland  also  adopt  a  reliability  test  for  assessing  the admissibility of all expert testimony  see Law Reform Commission, 2008 .  Admissibility of digital forensics as expert testimony  607   According  to  Casey   2011 ,  the  digital  forensic  tools  and  techniques  have  successfully withstood  the  courts’  assessment  of  reliability  and  admissibility  as  scientific  evidence. However, the ever-changing growth in technology makes it difficult to test and evaluate the  variety  of  digital  forensic  tools  in  a  quick  and  efficient  manner.  For  example,  as discussed in Chapter 13, NIST, an agency of the United States Department of Commerce, launched the Computer Forensic Tool Testing project  CFTT  to “provide unbiased, open, and  objective  means  for  manufacturers,  law  enforcement,  and  the  legal  community  to assess  the  validity  of  tools  used  in  computer  forensics”   NIST,  n.d. .  In  addition,  the CFTT determines whether the results of the tools are repeatable and reproducible, both of which are needed to assess “trueness and precision”  NIST, 2003: 4 . According to the NIST, there are approximately 150 different digital forensic tools currently being used by law enforcement worldwide  NIST, n.d. .  Although these goals clearly reflect the Daubert standards, the major weakness of the CFTT  project  is  the  amount  of  time  required  to  conduct  these  empirical  evaluations  Flandrin, Buchanan, Macfarlane, Ramsay, and Smales, 2014 . Therefore, “by the time the results  are  publicly  available,  the  version  of  the  tested  tool  might  be  deprecated”  Flandrin et al., 2014: 2 . In addition, the time required to test the tools, as well as the fact that  many  of  these  tools’  source  codes  are  proprietary,  make  it  difficult  to  determine known error rates  Carrier, 2003; Meyers and Rogers, 2004 . Still, the two most common digital forensic imaging tools, EnCase® and Forensic Toolkit®, along with others, have met  the  Daubert  standard  for  admissibility   see  Chapter  13;  Guidance  Software,  Inc., 2003; Leehealey, Lee, and Fountain, 2012 . For example, the general acceptance of EnCase and  FTK  by  the  scientific  community  was  noted  in  the  court  case  United  States  vs. Gaynor  2008 . In addition, EnCase and FTK have been extensively tested by the CFTT project.  Finally,  not  only  is  the  actual  digital  forensic  evidence  being  reviewed,  but  the credentials  of  the  digital  forensic  examiner  or  expert  also  fall  within  the  Daubert reliability  test.  This  includes  the  digital  forensic  examiner’s  education,  experience, training, and professional credentials. As discussed further in Chapter 15, this may be a problem in the field of digital forensics, which does not have a set standard for certifying digital forensic examiners  Meyers and Rogers, 2004 . In fact, there is a wide variability of certifications available for digital forensic examiners. There are currently a number of professional  certifications  available,  both  vendor  neutral   e.g.,  GIAC  Certified  Forensic Analyst   and  vendor  specific   i.e.,  tool  specific,  such  as  EnCase®  Forensic  Training Series; Ryan and and Ryan, 2014 . Thus, there is no standardized list of certifications or qualifications  required  in  the  digital  forensics  discipline  in  order  to  be  considered  a digital forensics professional or expert.  Although  the  field  of  digital  forensics  is  in  its  infancy,  it  has  quickly  gained recognition  as  a  legitimate  subdiscipline  within  the  forensic  sciences   see  Chapter  12 . For  example,  the  American  Academy  of  Forensic  Science   AAFS   formally  recognized the  field  of  digital  forensics  in  2008  with  the  creation  of  the  Digital  and  Multimedia Sciences section – the first section added to the AAFS in 28 years.  608   In  addition,  a  number  of  peer-reviewed  journals  have  emerged,  including  the International  Journal  of  Digital  Evidence,  Digital  Investigation,  and  the  International Journal of Digital Crime and Forensics. Thus, the peer recognition and publication prong of  the Daubert  standard  has  clearly  gained  momentum  within  the  past  decade  for  the field of digital forensics.  Being well versed on the extensive body of case law and federal regulations pertaining to the role of digital evidence is a difficult task. In a recent study by Losavio, Adams, and Rogers  2006 , state general jurisdiction judges from around the country were surveyed to gain insight as to exactly what they know about digital forensics. Losavio et al.  2006  found  that  the  judges  in  the  study  admitted  to  a  low  level  of  understanding  of  and training with digital evidence in the courtroom.  At  the  same  time,  judges  displayed  an  eagerness  to  gain  understanding  through effective training methods. Since then, several government agencies and public– private partnerships have emerged around the country to address this gap in judicial experience. One  of  the  most  successful  programs  is  the  National  Computer  Forensics  Institute  NCFI , a division of the United States Secret Service located in Hoover, Alabama. The NCFI  is  a  training  center  operated  by  the  United  States  Secret  Service’s  Criminal Investigative Division and the Alabama Office of Prosecution Services with the mission of providing high-quality, hands-on experience to law enforcement personnel around the country   see  www.ncfi.usss.gov .  State  and  local  officials,  prosecutors,  and  judges  can enroll in any of the 12 courses offered at no cost. Overall, with the Internet’s growth and the corresponding increase in computer-related crime, it is essential and inevitable that training  and  educational  programs  emerge  for  all  members  of  the  criminal  justice system.  609   Summary  This chapter highlighted the challenges that digital evidence and investigators may face in  presenting  evidence  at  trial.  The  issue  of  compelling  information  sharing  via  key disclosure  is  also  challenging,  with  no  real  global  standard  in  place.  These  factors  all demonstrate that the entire digital forensics process is under scrutiny, and the validity of digital forensics is assessed by whether or not the evidence is admissible in a court of law. Overall, technology is constantly changing. Therefore it is inevitable that national and international case law and federal regulations will change as well.

There  are  a  number  of  exceptions  to  the  warrant  requirement  for  a search  and  seizure.  Identify  five  different  exceptions  to  this  rule  and create  a  different  scenario  for  each  that  would  involve  the  search  and seizure of electronic evidence.  2.  Identify the four criteria for determining whether digital forensic expert testimony  is  admissible  in  court  according  to  the  Daubert  standard. Assess each of these criteria and explain whether or not digital forensic evidence should be admissible in court.  3.  There are inconsistencies between national and international laws on a variety  of  legal  issues  associated  with  digital  forensic  investigations. Describe  two  of  these  inconsistencies  and  discuss  whether  or  not  a universal, international law or policy is possible regarding the treatment of digital forensic evidence in court.  4.  Create two different scenarios involving third-party consent to conduct a search  and  seizure.  In  the  first  scenario,  the  third-party  member  is  not legally  able  to  provide  consent  to  law  enforcement.  In  the  second scenario,  the  third-party  member  is  able  to  provide  consent  to  law enforcement to conduct a search and seizure. Finally, do you agree with the current interpretation of the apparent authority principle? Explain.  612   References  Acharya, B.  2014, September 25 . Anvar v.

Recognize how digital forensics will evolve with technology generally.  618   Introduction  The  range  of  cybercrimes  discussed  throughout  this  book  illustrates  the  complexity  of these offenses and the unique ways in which technology is being used by criminals to hide themselves, make it easier to engage in crimes online and offline, and connect with others.  Since  technology  is  constantly  changing,  it  is  difficult  to  know  when  or  how offenders will adopt a new mode of offending based on access to the Internet.  This issue was exemplified on December 11, 2016, when John Rayne Rivello, using the twitter  handle  @jew_goldstein,  sent  an  animated  gif,  or  Graphic  Interchange  Format image, to journalist Kurt Eichenwald’s twitter account  Kang, 2017 . A gif is a series of images  strung  together  to  create  a  short  animated  scene,  typically  featuring  cats, celebrities, or scenes from popular films. In this case, Rivello created a gif that acted as a strobe  light  to  flash  bright  lights  on  and  off  in  the  hopes  of  causing  Eichenwald,  an epileptic, to have a seizure. In addition, the images contained the message “you deserve a seizure,” suggesting the sender intended to cause Eichenwald harm  Kang, 2017 .  Rivello  was  angry  at  Eichenwald,  a  reporter  for  Newsweek,  for  his  critical  stories detailing the potential criminal activities of Donald Trump throughout the presidential election. Eichenwald’s work drew a great deal of fire from Trump supporters online who would  frequently  spam  him  with  anti-Semitic  messages  and  death  threats.  Rivello  felt that  Eichenwald  deserved  to  be  punished  for  his  comments  and  even  texted  friends saying, “Spammed this [gif] at [Eichenwald] let’s see if he dies”  Kang, 2017 .  Upon  seeing  the  gif,  Eichenwald  reported  that  he  had  an  eight-minute  seizure  that caused him to lose control of his bodily functions and left him incapacitated for several days   Kang,  2017 .  Eichenwald’s  wife  subsequently  contacted  police  and  the  FBI  to investigate the sender. The FBI’s investigation subsequently led them to identify Rivello, despite  his  use  of  a  disposable  cell  phone  and  twitter  account  with  no  identifying information.  Rivello  is  currently  charged  with  cyberstalking  with  the  intent  to  kill  or cause bodily harm, which is a rare set of charges to pursue with a cybercrime case. A grand  jury  in  Texas  hearing  the  case  supported  the  notion  that  the  gif  constituted  a deadly  weapon  in  the  course  of  the  assault  because  it  was  clearly  designed  to  affect Eichenwald’s physical condition. Rivello is also being charged with committing a hate crime  on  the  basis  that  he  decided  to  attack  Eichenwald  on  the  basis  of  his  religious identity.  The use of an online image to cause real-world harm is rare, making this entire case relatively unprecedented. This case demonstrates the difficulty present in forecasting the future  of  cybercrime.  There  are  a  range  of  factors  that  will  influence  any  trends  in cybercrime,  including  the  popularity  of  a  given  technology,  the  recognition  among offenders of how to use these devices, and the ability of law enforcement to investigate these offenses. This chapter will attempt to consider all of these issues in order to provide  619   some context for the future of cybercrime from the standpoint of offenses, researchers, and  policing.  We  will  also  discuss  the  challenges  inherent  in  legislating  against cybercrimes in an increasingly borderless world.  For  more  information  on  one  of  the  first  instances  of  individuals  using  the Internet  as  a  means  to  cause  physical  harm  to  others  in  the  real  world,  go online  to:  www.news.com.au technology anonymous-attack-targets-epilepsy- sufferers news-story 702ed0bbf0b49dd63aaee33f295ba1d4.  620   Considering the future of cybercrime  It is extremely difficult to forecast the future of cybercrime due to the inherent changes in technology use and implementation both nationally and internationally. As one type of  product  gains  a  large  market  share,  hackers  and  cybercriminals  will  find  ways  to exploit it to their advantage  see Chapters 3 and 4 . This is particularly true of primary operating systems, as attacks affecting Linux and Mac users increased in 2016  Symantec, 2016 .  In  fact,  a  number  of  vulnerabilities  and  exploits  were  identified  that  directly affected  iOS  users  in  2016,  which  is  a  reflection  of  the  global  popularity  of  iPhones, iPads, and other Apple products  Cunningham, 2016 .  The  growth  of  tablets  and  smart  phones  has  created  a  new  and  stable  platform  for hackers  and  malware  writers  to  target,  as  is  evident  in  the  substantial  number  of malware  infected  apps  available  on  both  the  Apple  Apps  store  and  Google  Play.  The Android application market is a somewhat greater target as it is largely unregulated and can  easily  serve  as  a  vehicle  to  distribute  malicious  software  under  the  guise  of  a legitimate application  see Chapter 4 for details . However, McAfee  2016  identified over 37  million  malware-installed  applications  across  both  Apple  and  Google’s  app  stores during the last six months of 2015 alone. This trend will no doubt continue until such time as mobile phone users recognize the threat they face and take steps to secure their systems through antivirus software and regular updates  McAfee, 2016 .  The increased use of cloud storage, where files and documents are stored remotely on web  servers  that  can  be  accessed  via  the  Internet  rather  than  stored  on  individual devices, also creates a novel attack point for hackers  Mulazzani, Schrittwieser, Leithner, Huber, and Weippl, 2011 . Individuals and corporations are increasingly turning to cloud storage providers like Google and Dropbox to provide both easy remote access to files to enable working in groups from any location and simple backups for data in the event of loss. In fact, estimates suggest that Dropbox has over 500 million users around the world, making them one of the largest cloud storage providers to date  Hansen, 2017 .  While this sort of storage provides an invaluable mechanism to share files securely, individuals may place files that contain sensitive information on these servers, including personally  identifiable  information  or  intellectual  property  that  could  be  stolen  Mulazzani et al.,  2011 .  In  addition,  there  are  multiple  ways  in  which  hackers  could compromise  user  accounts  to  capture  shared  files,  from  stealing  a  username  and password to more complex methods involving the use of tools to capture data while in transit  Mulazzani et al., 2011 . In fact, the use of iCloud to store photos and videos was what led hackers to target celebrity nude content leading to the Fappening, as discussed in Chapter 7. Given the tremendous popularity of these services, it is likely that this will become  a  valuable  resource  for  hackers  to  identify  sensitive  information  and  affect individuals and corporations worldwide.  621   For more information on the ways in which cloud storage may be abused by cybercriminals, go online to:  www.technologyreview.com s 518506 dropbox-and- similar-services-can-sync-malware .  An additional trend that is likely to occur is the use of ransomware, or malware that requires victims to actively pay fees in order to regain access to encrypted system files and  data   see  Chapter  4  for  details;  also  Ferguson,  2013 .  The  cybersecurity  vendor Symantec   2016   noted  that  ransomware  attacks  increased  by  35  percent  from  2014  to 2015 and began to target mobile devices, including smart phones, web servers, and the Mac and Linux operating systems for laptop and desktop PCs. This is likely due to the fact that attackers can readily profit from these types of attacks, and victims are highly likely  to  pay  the  ransom  rather  than  allow  their  data  to  be  lost  forever.  Thus,  it  is expected  that  ransomware-style  attacks  will  continue  to  increase  and  evolve  over  the next few years  see Box 15.1 for details on the evolving state of ransomware .  Box 15.1 Understanding changes in ransomware  www.symantec.com content en us enterprise media security_response whitepapers the- evolution-of-ransomware.pdf.  Security response: the evolution of ransomware  The modern-day ransomware has evolved considerably since its origins 26 years ago with the appearance of the AIDS trojan. The AIDS trojan was released into the unsuspecting world through snail mail using 51 4 floppy disks in 1989.  This article provides a detailed review of the evolution of ransomware from the first trojan  malware  in  1989  to  the  spread  of  various  scareware  programs  in  the  mid- 2000s, to present-day ransomware tools by the computer security vendor Symantec. It demonstrates the way in which ransomware developers target victims and prey upon unsuspecting or unsophisticated victims.  622   It is also likely that person-based cybercrimes such as bullying and harassment will continue to increase over the next decade  see Chapter 9 . As digital natives continue to use  various  forms  of  social  networking  through  mobile  phones  and  tablets,  the opportunities  for  individuals  to  be  targeted  by  bullies  and  stalkers  will  increase. Applications  such  as  Snapchat,  Twitter,  and  Instagram  allow  anyone  easily  to  post personal  information  about  where  they  are,  with  whom  they  are  hanging  out,  and preferences  for  activities.  The  ability  to  now  live-stream  video  on  Facebook  and Instagram  also  enables  individuals  to  share  their  experiences  of  bullying  and  abusing others  with  anyone  online.  As  a  result,  individuals  can  now  be  easily  singled  out  and embarrassed or shamed via social media in ways that may only be seen by their target or by  a  truly  global  audience.  In  fact,  several  high-profile  incidents  of  harassment  and bullying via social media occurred during 2016, ranging from a Playboy playmate body shaming  an  overweight  woman  on  Instagram  to  the  experiences  of  Kurt  Eichenwald discussed above  see Box 15.2 for an additional story of Leslie Jones’s harassment . Thus, the evolving state of social media use will continue to create a problematic environment for person-based cybercrimes.  Box 15.2 Examining the harassment experienced by  Leslie Jones on Twitter  www.nytimes.com 2016 07 20 movies leslie-jones-star-of-ghostbusters-becomes-a- target-of-online-trolls.html.  Leslie Jones, star of Ghostbusters, becomes a target of online trolls  “Ok I have been called Apes,” she wrote on Twitter, “even got a pic with semen on my face. I’m trying to figure out what human means. I’m out.”  623   This article provides a harrowing look at the ways in which actress Leslie Jones was harassed  in  an  organized  fashion  by  a  group  of  Twitter  users  led  in  part  by  Milo Yiannopoulous.  They  specifically  targeted  Jones  for  her  race,  appearance,  and performance  incident demonstrates that no one is immune from online harassment and the ways in which social media enables access to virtually anyone from anywhere.  in  the  2016  remake  of  the  film  Ghostbusters.  This   624   How technicways will shift with new technologies  As is evident throughout this book, human beings readily adapt their social habits and methods of engaging with the world to fit with available technologies. This process of behavioral  changes  based  on  technological  changes  is  referred  to  as  technicways,  and can lead to large-scale institutional changes based on evolutions in behavior  see Chapter 1;  also  Odum,  1937 .  For  instance,  individuals  now  use  email  and  electronic communications  to  connect  with  others  rather  than  traditional  hand-delivered  mail through a postal service. How technicways will continue to lead to behavioral change is not immediately apparent, though it will most likely stem from the success or failure of several  new  technologies  that  are  becoming  available  to  consumers  over  the  next  few years.  For  instance,  there  are  a  range  of  Internet-enabled  wearable  devices  that  have become popular which more completely integrate technology into our daily lives. In fact, it is estimated that there will be 780 million wearable devices in use by 2018  Maddox, 2015 . Devices like the FitBit, iWatch, Pebble, and various Samsung smart tools can be connected  to  mobile  phones  via  bluetooth  to  capture  data  on  daily  eating  habits, exercise,  heart  rate,  and  even  sleep  cycles.  Information  captured  by  these  devices  are presented  to  the  user  via  applications  that  assess  overall  wellness,  health  information, and calorie intake in the hopes of providing behavioral management strategies for those looking to lose weight, track fitness, or generally feel better.  The information collected by wearable devices may seem generally insignificant, as a person’s daily caloric intake does not have the same immediate economic value as their credit  or  debit  card  information.  When  viewed  in  the  aggregate,  however,  the  data developed and stored by smart device programs can generate substantial granular details on a person’s general level of health and lifestyle that may be monetized by companies and  in  turn  by  criminal  organizations.  For  instance,  Fitbits  and  other  health-tracking wearable devices are being used by corporate health and wellness plans as a means to more  effectively  track  and  price  company  health  insurance  plans   Olson,  2012 .  The ability to directly capture behavioral patterns of employees can ensure that companies reduce  health  care  plan  costs  by  rewarding  those  who  exercise  and  maintain  better lifestyles with reduced cost coverage, or raising rates for those with poor health choices  Olson, 2012 .  The  use  of  such  data  collection  methods  creates  massive  opportunities  for  data breaches  affecting  health-based  application  services   Collins,  Sainato,  and  Khey,  2011 . As noted in Chapter 6, data breaches have become a common problem leading to the loss of consumer financial information. It is likely only a matter of time before hackers begin to target the companies that store wearable device data in order to find ways to monetize their data for fraudulent purposes. In fact, a number of Fitbit user accounts were targeted  625   by fraudsters who were able to take over the user accounts, and then fraudulently obtain replacement devices under the guise that they had been damaged  Krebs, 2016a .  Although  this  is  a  relatively  simple  form  of  fraud  with  minimal  impact  upon  user data, it is likely the first step in the larger process of monetization by cyber-criminals. The problems of account takeovers to data breaches are likely due to several issues in managing  these  devices.  Specifically,  many  wearable  devices  have  little  to  no  security products  to  minimize  the  risk  of  loss,  whether  through  password  protection  on  the device,  antivirus  products,  or  solid  encryption  of  communications  between  the  device and  the  smart  phones  which  manage  the  applications   Maddox,  2015 .  There  is  also  a relative lack of transparency in the ways in which the data collected by companies may be kept private, or the extent to which the data may be resold to third parties  Maddox, 2015 .  For  more  on  one  of  the  first  attacks  targeting  Fitbit  users,  go  online  to: https:  krebsonsecurity.com 2016 01 account-takeovers-fueling-warranty-fraud .  In much the same way, companies and utilities providers are encouraging consumers in  the  USA  and  the  UK  to  adopt  thermostats  and  home  security  systems  that  can  be accessed  and  controlled  via  wireless  Internet  connections   Curtis,  2013 .  These  devices allow consumers to easily manage their energy use and view goings-on in their home with great ease. Some of these devices can even be controlled through applications on smart phones or web browsers, creating what some refer to as the Internet of Things  IoT , or all non-computing devices connected together via the Internet  Curtis, 2013 .  The  convenience  afforded  by  these  technologies  cannot  be  understated,  though  the implications they have for our personal security are significant. For instance, running an app on your phone that allows you to access and control home security settings in effect turns the device into a set of keys  Curtis, 2013 . If you were to lose your phone, then an individual who picks it up may be able to remotely control the security of your home. Similarly, controlling the heating and cooling system of your home through a wireless device means that hackers could potentially access these systems remotely. To that end, two white-hat hackers were able to implement a ransomware attack targeting a smart thermostat at the 2016 Defcon hacker conference. The malware was intended as a proof of concept to demonstrate the insecurity of these devices, but could just as likely have been implemented by a black-hat hacker in the wild.  626   Even more concerning is the fact that many IoT devices like televisions, web cameras, and  appliances  do  not  have  much  by  way  of  security  features  to  protect  them  from compromise. While a smart TV may not contain much sensitive information about you, it  is  constantly  online  and  connected  to  the  Internet.  As  a  result,  it  can  be  used  as  an attack  platform  by  enterprising  hackers  whose  misuse  may  never  be  noticed  by  the device owners. This was first observed in September 2016 when a massive DDoS attack was launched against security journalist Brian Krebs’s website by IoT devices infected with a botnet malware variant called Mirai  Krebs, 2016b . This same form of malware was  used  in  a  DDoS  attack  targeting  the  service  provider  Dyn  which  supports  the websites for GitHub, Twitter, Netflix, AirBnB, and many other major groups. The attack was successful enough to prevent many Internet users on the East Coast of the USA from being able to access various websites for several days  Newman, 2016 . Thus, we should give  careful  consideration  to  the  impact  that  our  rather  immediate  adoption  of technologies can have upon our lives before we take the equipment out of the box.  on   For  more  https:  iotsecurityfoundation.org the-iot-ransomware-threat-is-more-serious- thanyou-think .  devices,   threats   IoT   the   go   to   online   to:  627   Social movements, technology, and social change  While technology will no doubt force subtle shifts in patterns of human behavior, it will also be at the forefront of rapid social changes in political and government structures. The  Internet  and  CMCs  provide  individuals  with  an  outlet  to  express  dissent  with policies and practices of their own government or those of foreign nations  see Chapter 10;  also  DiMaggio,  Hargittai,  Neuman,  and  Robinson,  2001;  Van  Laer,  2010 .  These technologies also allow nation-states’ most vulnerable and critical systems to be attacked with  greater  secrecy  and  fewer  resources  than  might  otherwise  be  required  offline  Brodscky and Radva-novsky, 2010 . Now that attack techniques like Stuxnet have made cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure a reality rather than a theoretical potential, we can expect this to become increasingly problematic.  As  discussed  in  Chapters  3  and  10,  an  increasing  number  of  hackers  target government and industry resources based on their individual political, nationalistic, and religious  motives   Holt,  2009;  Kilger,  2011 .  In  fact,  web  defacements  by  politically motivated  hacker  groups  are  common  following  political  events  in  the  real  world  Denning, 2010; Kilger, 2011; Woo, Kim, and Dominick, 2004 . Denial-of-service attacks have also become a common tactic to disrupt the electronic resources of a nation-state when physical conflicts emerge, as evident in the Russia–Estonia conflict. As a result, we can expect these sorts of attacks to increase over the next decade as more countries gain consistent Internet access and become technologically sophisticated  McAfee, 2016 .  At  the  same  time,  the  proliferation  of  the  Internet  may  play  a  vital  role  in transforming the nature of violent extremist activity in the real world. Since the Internet and  social  media  have  revolutionized  access  to  extremist  groups  and  messaging,  it  is possible for individuals to be exposed to radical messaging from anywhere at virtually any time. Acceptance of an ideology may no longer be dependent on intense or proximal real-world  social  relationships,  but  rather  on  the  extent  to  which  messaging  connects with the individual. Some may refer to this process as “self-radicalization,” in that the individual  comes  to  accept  a  radical  ideology  on  the  basis  of  exposure  to  extremist content online without the need for actual physical social engagements with those in the movement. Even if a person makes tangential ties on the basis of interactions via social media, email, or a forum, this sort of contact constitutes a social interaction within the context of a larger extremist or terrorist subculture.  The  problem  of  self-radicalization  via  the  Internet  was  also  evident  in  the  mass shooting  targeting  patrons  at  the  gay  nightclub  Pulse  in  Orlando,  Florida  on  June  12, 2016. The shooter, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others, making it both the  deadliest  shooting  by  one  person,  and  the  most  deadly  attack  against  the  gay community in US history  Wilber, 2016 . Mateen had no immediate prior affiliation with any  known  terrorist  group.  He  had,  however,  been  placed  on  the  FBI’s  Terrorist  628   Screening Database due to threats of violence made toward co-workers as well as claims that he joined Hezbollah, while his family had ties to Al Qaeda  Goldman, 2016 . A ten- month investigation by the FBI found no substantive evidence to support the fact that he was a threat, though it was determined that he knew an American Muslim who traveled to Syria and performed a suicide bombing in May 2014.  When  Omar  Mateen  attacked  the  Pulse  club,  he  repeatedly  made  statements  to victims, 911 operators, and an Orlando news station that he pledged allegiance to ISIL. He  also  made  mention  of  the  Boston  Marathon  bombers  by  name,  as  well  as  his acquaintance who engaged in the suicide attack in Syria. The lack of concrete support for  these  claims  caused  confusion  among  law  enforcement  and  intelligence  agencies. There is, however, limited evidence that he engaged with radical jihadist groups online through open web searches for Islamic State websites and content. Specifically, he was trying to find a speech made by the ISIS leader Abu Bar al-Baghdadi  Ross, Schwartz, Dukakis, and Ferran, 2016 . He also actively sought out and watched videos uploaded by radical groups, including beheadings of various people  Goldman, 2016; Wilber, 2016 .  Mateen  also  made  several  posts  on  Facebook  the  same  day  that  he  engaged  in  the shooting.  For  instance,  he  wrote:  “You  kill  innocent  women  and  children  by  doing  us airstrikes..now  taste  the  Islamic  state  vengeance.  [.]  In  the  next  few  days  you  will  see attacks from the Islamic State in the usa”  Ross et al., 2016 . He also wrote, “America and Russia stop bombing the Islamic State” as well as a statement pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIL: “I pledge my alliance to abu bakr al Baghdadi [.] may Allah accept me. The  real  muslims  will  never  accept  the  filthy  ways  of  the  west”   Zimmerman,  2016 . While these posts had been deleted, it appears that Mateen made some overt expressions of sympathy to Islamic terror group positions.  As a result, he was exposed to radical messaging online which enabled him to self- radicalize.  The  connections  made  to  the  larger  ISIL  movement  and  subculture  suggest that Mateen may be appropriately classified as a colleague rather than as a lone wolf. His online  connections,  no  matter  how  brief,  coupled  with  his  lone  involvement  in  the attack,  suggest  that  the  role  of  the  Internet  in  potential  real-world  violence  cannot  be underestimated.  Future  study  is  needed  to  further  understand  the  behavioral, psychological, and social factors that may spur self-radicalization so that we may better understand how terror and extremism will evolve as a result of technology.  629   Need for new cyber criminological theories?  Chapters 3 through 10 illustrated the various ways in which technology has influenced the commission of many forms of crime. In most instances, “newer” forms of crime were not born out of technology. Instead, criminals were able to use the Internet and various devices to commit traditional forms of crime and deviance in more effective and efficient ways.  Thus,  the  notion  that  cybercrime  may  be  viewed  as  “old  wine  in  a  new  bottle”  Grabosky, 2001: Wall, 1998; see also Chapter 11, this volume  has strong merit. In fact, the  current  body  of  criminological  research  on  cybercrime  as  discussed  in  Chapter  11 demonstrates that traditional theories of offending apply well to cybercrimes that have substantively  similar  counterparts  in  the  physical  world,  such  as  theft,  harassment, bullying, and pornography. In addition, traditional criminological theories have provided considerable  insight  into  somewhat  more  technical  cybercrimes,  such  as  unauthorized access to computer systems. For example, one of the strongest predictors of cybercrime offending  is  the  same  as  that  of  traditional  crime  –  associating  with  delinquent  or criminal  peers   Holt  and  Bossler,  2014,  2016 .  Having  friends  who  engage  in  various forms  of  cybercrime  increases  the  likelihood  that  the  individual  will  engage  in  these same offenses as well. In addition, definitions  e.g., values, norms, statements, etc.  that support involvement in cybercrimes are also associated with an individual’s willingness to engage in cybercrime, as is their acceptance of techniques of neutralization that justify offending behavior. In the social control literature, low self-control has been repeatedly found to be a substantive predictor of almost all types of crime, including various forms of cybercrime  Holt and Bossler, 2014, 2016 .  Given  the  support  that  these  theories  have  in  the  larger  literature,  one  of  the  most critical steps researchers can take to move the discipline forward is to elaborate on these existing theories. For instance, though it is clear that deviant peer relationships directly increase  the  risk  of  cybercrime  offending,  few  have  identified  whether  virtual  peer networks  or  those  in  the  real  world  have  a  greater  impact  on  activity   Higgins,  2005; Holt, Burruss, and Bossler, 2010 . It may be that having friends in the real world who engage in cybercrime is more pertinent to the introduction of these activities. A recent case  study  analysis  performed  by  Leukfeldt  and  colleagues  found  that  offline relationships were important in the formation of criminal networks to facilitate phishing and malware use  Leukfeldt, Kleemans, and Stol, 2017 . Those who had access to online social  networks  of  cybercriminals  via  forums,  however,  were  more  likely  to  engage  in technical offenses with greater ease and efficiency. This analysis points to the need for additional studies using data from unique sources to better understand the intersections of virtual and real relationships in order to disentangle the relationship between peers and cybercrime generally.  There is also a need for research considering how certain demographic factors affect  630   the  likelihood  of  engaging  in  or  becoming  a  victim  of  cybercrime.  In  criminological research  on  real-world  offenses,  there  is  a  significant  relationship  between  living  in poverty  and  the  risk  of  offending  and  victimization   see  Bradshaw,  Sawyer,  and O’Brennan,  2009;  Bursik  and  Grasmick  1993 .  While  technology  use  has  become  more ubiquitous,  even  for  those  living  in  low-income  communities,  it  is  possible  that  the degree to which individuals use these devices on a daily basis may significantly affect the  risk  of  cybercrime  victimization.  Individuals  living  in  poverty  may  generally  have little  disposable  income  for  Internet  connectivity  or  online  shopping  and  may  be  less inclined to own their own computer. Instead, they may use computers in local libraries or other publicly accessible locations, which may reduce their risk of malware infections or  computer  hacking   Smith,  2013 .  The  same  individual  may  be  more  likely  to  use  a mobile phone in order to access social media and email, which may increase their risk of cyberbullying and harassment  Smith, 2013 .  like  self-control.  A  recent  study  by  Udris   Recent  research  by  Holt,  Turner,  and  Exum   2014   found  that  in  a  large  sample  of North  Carolina  youth,  those  living  in  disorganized  communities  were  more  likely  to experience verbal, physical, and cyberbullying victimization over and above individual characteristics  that disorganization  was  unrelated  to  youth  involvement  in  digital  piracy  downloading behaviors but was associated with a measure asking, “Did you ever use your computer for ‘hacking’?” This is a rather nebulous measure that does not provide sufficient detail to  understand  whether  this  includes  password  guessing  or  more  serious  criminal activities. Thus, further study is needed to understand the potential association between neighborhood conditions and the risk of both cybercrime offending and victimization.   2016    found   At the same time, this book has demonstrated that there is something unique about cybercrime offending that separates it from traditional crime. There are some instances of  “new  wine,”  such  as  malware  creation,  that  have  little  connection  to  either  the physical  world  or  the  second  part  of  the  analogy  –  the  new  bottle.  In  this  case, examining  the  uniqueness  of  cybercrime  may  allow  us  to  better  understand  these phenomena  as  well  as  provide  brand  new  insights  on  traditional  forms  of  crime.  For instance, studies examining the prevalence of technically complex forms of cybercrime like malware creation are relatively rare among university student samples and generally find  few  behavioral  correlates   e.g.  Rogers,  Smoak,  and  Liu,  2006;  Skinner  and  Fream, 1997 . More research is needed to identify not only the prevalence and activities of these technically sophisticated forms of malware writers and users, but also what behavioral or  attitudinal  drives  make  these  criminals  distinct  from  other  criminals  and  their  acts that require less knowledge or skill on the part of the offender.  Considering  that  criminological  theory  development  has  slowed  over  the  past  few decades,  discussions  of  new  cyber-specific  criminological  theories  may  be  the  catalyst that  rejuvenates  this  field.  For  instance,  the  discussion  of  digital  drift   Goldsmith  and Brewer,  2015   presented  in  Chapter  11  demonstrates  that  there  may  be  utility  in revisiting  older  criminological  frameworks  that  recognize  the  unique  nature  of criminality. Individuals need not view themselves as criminals or delinquents in order to  631   engage in such activities online; opportunities to offend are omnipresent, and it is up to the  person  to  avoid  offending.  Although  this  framework  has  potential  value,  no empirical  research  to  date  has  tested  propositions  of  digital  drift.  Thus,  more  study  is needed  to  understand  its  true  capability.  Taken  as  a  whole,  the  future  of  cybercrime research is bright. The field will help elaborate complex associations that have been held in  the  traditional  literature  for  decades  while  also  providing  new  insights  into  the commission of crime – both traditional and cyber-related.  632   Shifting enforcement strategies in the age of the Internet  As noted throughout this text, law enforcement agencies across the world are engaged in the  investigation  of  cybercrime.  The  capabilities  of  these  agencies  to  investigate cybercrimes range greatly based on both the specific agency in question as well as the type of cybercrime being investigated. Governments have provided substantive resources to fund policing agencies to pursue child exploitation crimes and child pornography as individual units and in connection with one another  see Chapter 8 . Few mechanisms, however, exist to help connect the investigative capabilities of local, state, federal, and international agencies in their investigations of malicious software use and data theft.  In order to move beyond the limits posed by limited inter-agency cooperation, some degree of innovation is required in order for police agencies to disrupt and deter some forms  of  cybercrime.  One  strategy  which  has  promise  at  the  local  level  involves collaboration between the public and police through the use of principles derived from community-oriented policing. Community policing has shaped modern police practices over the past 30 years through innovative programs that not only identify but address local  problems  through  community-based  partnerships   Skogan,  2006 .  The  actual implementation of community policing varies from agency to agency, though there are three consistent components observed:  1  a responsibility shared by the community and police  to  address  crime  through  non-arrest  proactive  strategies   Adams  et  al  .,  2002; Bayley, 1998; Mastrofski, Worden, and Snipes, 1995; Skogan, 2006; Sko-gan and Hartnett, 1997 ;  2  solutions to problems considered to be the greatest concerns of the community  Miller, 1999 ; and  3  organizational changes which support partnerships in the public and private sector  Braga, 2008; McGarrell Chermak, Wilson, and Corsaro, 2006 .  A  community-oriented  policing  program  to  deal  with  cybercrimes  may  be  best designed around the use of an online strategy that can integrate the community in the spaces  where  they  may  observe  offenses  as  they  happen.  Such  an  idea  has  been supported  by  academics   Brenner,  2008;  Forss,  2010;  Jones,  2007;  Wall  and  Williams, 2007  and practitioners alike, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police  2009 .  Although  there  is  no  practical  example  of  such  a  program  to  deal  only  with cybercrimes,  there  are  several  examples  of  agencies  using  social  media  platforms  as  a venue for the public to share information with the police regarding major crimes and for the police to share information back to the public on crimes or disorder issues as they happen  see Box  15.3  for  an  example;  also  Heverin  and  Zach,  2010;  Wang  and  Doong, 2010 .  Box 15.3 Understanding the Burgernet in the  Netherlands  633   www.cgi.com sites default files pdf Burgernet-gets-citizens-involvedpolice-work- Netherlands.pdf.  Burgernet, Netherlands: Burgernet gets citizens involved in police work  Burgernet participants receive a voice or a text message on their  mobile  telephone giving them a clear description of a specific person or vehicle and asking them to keep a look out. If a participating citizen sees the person or vehicle concerned, they call the free Burgernet number and are automatically put through to the control room.  This  article  provides  an  important  example  of  the  Burgernet,  an  app-based mechanism  for  citizens  and  the  police  to  share  information  and  protect  their community  in  real  time.  The  benefits  of  this  tool  and  its  rollout  across  the Netherlands is described in this short research piece, and demonstrates how modern technologies may be leveraged to better engage in community policing.  Using a similar structure to produce intelligence on cybercrimes could be extremely valuable,  as  citizens  who  want  to  participate  could  engage  with  law  enforcement agencies at any time and in a medium that may be more accessible to young people and technologically-savvy  Internet  users   Brenner,  2008;  Jones,  2007;  Wall,  2001;  Wall  and Williams,  2007 .  In  addition,  online  reporting  mechanisms  may  allow  individuals  who may be engaged in deviant or criminal communities to anonymously report crimes they observe  that  may  otherwise  be  unknown  to  police,  particularly  on  proxy-supported networks like Tor that require technical proficiency to access  Wall, 2001, 2007; Wall and Williams, 2007 .  634   Box 15.4 Investigating Tor users  www.techweekeurope.co.uk news tor-anonymisation-nccu-cyber-crime-129249 .  New UK cyber police chief: we need skills to de-anonymize Tor crooks  The National Cyber Crime Unit  NCCU , launched alongside the National Crime Agency earlier this week, has continued an ongoing project to break the anonymisation of Tor users where it believes illegal activity is taking place, NCCU chief Andy Archibald told Tech-Week this morning, during a discussion hosted by Symantec.  This article provides an important example of the ways in which law enforcement agencies are attempting to diminish the available resources cybercriminals have at their disposal to hide their identity. The discussion also demonstrates the difficulty agencies  have  in  terms  of  hiring  the  right  people  with  the  right  skills  to  combat cybercrime.  Law  enforcement  agencies  have  also  taken  steps  to  weaken  the  utility  of anonymization tools like Tor that help shield the identity and location of computer users  Dredge,  2013 .  As  noted  in  Chapter  1,  Tor  is  a  widely  popular  and  relatively  secure service  that  individuals  download  and  install  on  their  system.  Once  downloaded  and activated,  Tor  encrypts  an  individual’s  web  traffic  and  routes  it  through  a  network  of other  Tor  users’  systems  that  is  randomized,  making  it  difficult  to  locate  the  actual source of any user’s computer  Dredge, 2013 .  Because  of  the  security  that  Tor  affords,  a  wide  range  of  cybercriminals  use  this service  to  conceal  their  activities,  including  child  pornography  trading,  drug  markets, and sensitive information exchanges. As a result, the FBI, NSA, and GCHQ in the UK have begun to develop rather sophisticated resources to help identify vulnerabilities in Tor’s infrastructure that can give them information on individual users  see Box 15.4 for details; also Brewster, 2013 .  The legality of these efforts has recently been challenged in the USA through a child pornography  investigation  of  a  website  hosted  on  Tor  called  Playpen.  The  site  began operating in August 2014 and allowed individuals to both upload and download images of  child  sexual  exploitation   Krause,  2017 .  A  foreign  police  agency  contacted  the  FBI about the site, and was able to direct them to the location of the server hosting the site. Since  the  content  was  hosted  on  Tor,  the  FBI  was  not  able  to  identify  the  location  or identity of participants who were actively uploading and downloading content hosted by Playpen. As such, the FBI obtained a search warrant from a federal judge to actually take control of the site and the over 22,000 images of child pornography it hosted, in order to run it for 30 days on a government-controlled server  Krause, 2017 .  Once  in  control  of  the  site,  the  FBI  used  what  they  called  a network investigative technique  NIT  to compromise the browsers of individuals who visited the Playpen site  635   and determine their real identity and location via IP address information  Farivar, 2017 . This  strategy  enabled  the  FBI  to  bring  child  pornography  charges  against  180  people across  the  USA  as  part  of  what  they  dubbed  Operation  Pacifier.  Several  of  the individuals charged accepted plea deals in order to minimize their sentences and quickly end  their  time  in  court,  though  one  of  the  accused,  Jay  Michaud,  challenged  the government’s  case  on  the  basis  that  their  information  was  acquired  illegally   Farivar, 2017 . Michaud of Washington state claimed that the NIT employed was actually a form of malicious software that may not have been legal for the FBI to use. The district judge hearing  the  case  ordered  the  government  to  hand  over  the  details  of  the  NIT  so  that attorneys  could  understand  how  their  clients’  information  was  obtained,  and  to  what extent the tool may have acquired other data. The government felt they were unable to disclose the details of the NIT which are currently classified. As a result, they dropped all charges  against  Michaud  in  favor  of  retaining  the  possibility  of  prosecution  at  a  time when the disclosure of the NIT will not affect their ability to use the technique  Farivar, 2017 . Although this case is still ongoing, it points to the potential legal scrutiny that law enforcement techniques may face when attempting to subvert legal security tools for the purposes of engaging in criminal activities.  636   Considering the future of forensics  The  globalization  of  technology  has  vastly  changed  the  field  of  digital  forensics. Traditional  computer  forensics  focused  only  on  dead-box  forensics  involving  cases  of inappropriate  use  policies  or  unauthorized  computer  access.  Today,  almost  every criminal  investigation  will  involve  at  least  one  form  of  digital  evidence  due  to  the increased  use  of  technology  in  our  daily  lives;  in  addition,  criminal  cases  are  likely  to involve  more  than  one  form  of  digital  evidence   mobile  phone,  Internet  browsing history;  see  Chapter  12  for  discussion .  Approximately  47  percent  of  the  world’s population   7.3  billion   was  using  the  Internet  by  the  end  of  2016   International Telecommunication Union  ITU , 2016 , which is up from 30 percent in 2010. However, there  is  still  a  disparity  in  that  Internet  penetration  rates  are  only  at  40  percent  for developing countries and 15 percent for least developed countries compared to 81 percent for  developed  countries   ITU,  2016 .  Finally,  the  ITU   2016   report  indicates  that  an estimated  95  percent  of  the  global  population  are  living  in  an  area  covered  by  a  basic Gmobile cellular network.  This  continued  increase  in  technology  globalization  guarantees  that  the  criminal justice  system   e.g.,  law  enforcement,  prosecutors,  judges   will  need  to  become  more familiar with the basic, if not more advanced, forms of digital forensic investigation. In addition, the digital forensics investigator will need to sort through a variety of digital devices   e.g.,  IoT   as  well  as  filter  out  irrelevant  digital  information  from  massive volumes of data  e.g., 10-TB hard drive . As a result, this will likely force changes in the ability of criminal justice personnel to become more adept at recognizing technological devices  and  their  role  in  offending.  In  addition,  this  understanding  of  basic  digital evidence  collection  will  have  to  take  place  at  crime  scenes  themselves  to  ensure  a successful prosecution  see Chapter 13 for discussion .  The expansion of technology also has implications for the forensic sciences generally. For example, the National Research Council  NRC, 2009  issued a report on the status of forensic science in the USA that recognized the field of digital and multimedia analysis as a new subfield within the larger discipline of forensic science  NRC, 2009: 178–185 . Although the NRC acknowledged that the digital forensics discipline “has undergone a rapid  maturation  process”   2009:  181 ,  the  report  noted  that  several  challenges  still remain if digital forensics is to be a rigorous, forensic science discipline:  1  lack of an agreed-upon certification program or list of qualifications for digital forensic examiners;  2   clarifying  whether  the  examination  of  digital  evidence  is  an  investigative  or  a forensic  activity,  and   3   wide  variability  in,  and  a  degree  of  uncertainty  about,  the education, experience, and training of digital forensics professionals  p. 181 . To that end, there are currently a number of professional certifications available, both vendor neutral  e.g.,  GIAC  Certified  Forensic  Analyst   and  vendor  specific   i.e.,  tool  specific,  such  as  637   EnCase®  Forensic  Training  Series;  Ryan  and  Ryan,  2014 .  Unfortunately,  there  is  no standardized  list  of  certifications  or  qualifications  required  in  the  digital  forensics discipline in order for one to be considered a digital forensics professional or expert.  From this report, it is important to recognize that some progress has been made in the field of digital forensics. Researchers are working toward the development of a unifying professional  code  of  ethics  in  digital  forensics   Losavio,  Seigfried-Spellar,  and  Sloan, 2016 .  By  developing  a  professional  code  of  ethics  in  digital  forensics,  researchers  and practitioners hope to move the field of digital forensics to a unified profession  Seigfried- Spellar,  Rogers,  and  Crimmins,  2017 .  Also  in  response  to  the  NRC  report,  the Department  of  Justice  and  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology   NIST  established the National Commission on Forensic Science  NIST, 2013  to strengthen and enhance the forensic sciences. Under the Forensic Science Standards Board, the National Commission  on  Forensic  Science  administered  the  Organization  of  Scientific  Area Committees   OSAC ,  which  includes  the  field  of  digital  forensics.  The  OSAC  Digital Evidence   DE   subcommittee  is  specifically  made  up  of  digital  evidence,  facial identification,  speaker  recognition,  and  video imaging  technology  and  analysis.  The OSAC-DE  focuses  specifically  on  the  development  of  “the  standards  and  guidelines related to information of probative value that is stored or transmitted in binary form”  NIST, 2014 .  Overall, the future of digital forensics relies on the discipline’s ability to conquer each of the concerns highlighted by the NRC. The discipline needs to establish a standard of accreditation  for  digital  forensic  laboratories  as  well  as  a  standard  for  training  and continued  education  for  digital  forensic  examiners.  In  addition,  the  digital  forensics community  needs  to  create  a  standardized  protocol  for  the  process  of  conducting  a digital  forensics  investigation  that  focuses  on  the  forensic  scientific  method   Casey, 2011 . By following a scientific method, the examiner is less likely to overlook potential digital evidence or report erroneous findings. According to Casey  2011 , a protocol that focuses  on  the  scientific  method  will  encourage  digital  forensics  examiners  to  follow procedures that are “generally accepted, reliable, and repeatable” as well as more likely to lead to “logical, well-documented conclusions of high integrity”  p. 224 .  638   The challenge to policy makers globally  The  trends  identified  in  this  chapter  all  demonstrate  that  technological  innovations create myriad opportunities for crime and deviance. One of the most common ways in which policy makers, particularly in government and private industry, discuss how we may combat these problems is through the cultivation of better cyber-security principles that can be employed by the common person every day. Every time an individual uses their antivirus software or carefully reviews an email message before responding, they are  taking  basic  steps  to  secure  their  computer  or  device  from  compromise.  As  digital natives age, their use of and appreciation for technology may provide them with an even greater  degree  of  computer  security  awareness  than  that  of  the  digital  immigrants  of older generations. This may create a slight improvement in the general security posture of society as a whole.  Any  benefits  provided  by  improvements  in  security  awareness,  however,  may  be diminished by vulnerabilities and flaws in the computer systems and servers managed by  ISPs  and  industry.  When  a  new  vulnerability  in  an  otherwise  secure  product  is identified and weaponized by hackers, this directly threatens the security of all computer users through no fault of their own. The resources owned and operated by private and public entities that have a responsibility to protect personal information and resources should be secured through the best practices available. There is no guarantee that such protection may matter when large-scale vulnerabilities are found that directly impact the security of sensitive information. For instance, researchers identified a way to attack an older application in the OpenSSL  Secure Socket Layer  library used to encrypt sensitive data  as  it  moves  between  systems  online  in  March  2016   Higgins,  2016 .  The  attack, called DROWN, or Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption,  uses an  existing  but  obsolete  protocol  to  break  encryption  and  steal  sensitive  information from web browsers, email servers, and VPN sessions. More than 33 percent of all secured servers online were susceptible to the attack, though a patch was made available shortly after the public acknowledgment of this potential attack technique.  For  more  information  on  the  DROWN  attack  and  its  impact,  go  online  to: www.darkreading.com attacks-breaches ssl-drowns-in-yet-another-serious-security- flaw d d-id 1324521.  639   The  DROWN  incident  clearly  demonstrates  that  cyber-security  extends  beyond  the individual and cannot be easily guaranteed. While nothing can ever be guaranteed to be “hack  proof,”  if  developers  are  careful  to  identify  as  many  bugs  and  flaws  as  possible during the design phase, it may help minimize the likelihood of attacks once a product is available on the open market. Such a model is not currently in use among software and hardware developers, as it is viewed as too prohibitive and costly. Instead, vulnerabilities are often identified and patched once the product is adopted and in use in the field.  As  a  result,  some  government  agencies  have  begun  to  push  for  standards  of  cyber- security that promote the development of products that are more secure by design. For instance, the ISA Security Compliance Institute  ISCI  in the USA has developed multiple testing  and  compliance  specifications,  along  with  a  certification  program  for  SCADA system hardware and software, which are used in various critical infrastructure  Andress and Winterfeld, 2013 . By emphasizing and establishing basic guidelines, the hope is that these  systems  may  be  both  hardened  against  attacks  and  better  designed  generally. Similar  entities  exist  throughout  North  and  South  America,  Europe,  and  the  UK  to promote more secure products and create a degree of compliance that may be enforced by industrial regulatory bodies  Andress and Winterfeld, 2013 . Although these entities cannot  guarantee  that  a  product  will  be  completely  hardened  to  compromise,  the creation  of  standards  and  guidelines  provides  a  measurable  standard  that  can  be considered by regulators and policy makers when attempting to improve cyber-security practices among private industry.  In  addition  to  the  development  of  regulatory  and  industrial  standards,  lawmakers must create legislation that is both broad and flexible enough to be applied to a range of technological misuse while at the same time having substantive legal sanctions to deter individual offenders. Such a task is extremely difficult, as there is no way to know how a new  device  or  application  will  be  adopted  by  offenders  for  nefarious  purposes.  For example,  the  failure  to  successfully  prosecute  Lori  Drew  for  misuse  of  the  website MySpace  under  the  CFA  laws   Chapter  9   suggests  that  there  is  a  potential  need  to develop legislation against extreme outcomes resulting from cyberbullying. At the same time, legislative overreach can have negative outcomes as well. This is exemplified in the ongoing legal challenges to the FBI’s strategies to investigate Tor, as outlined on page 639.  The  use  of  exploitive  malware  by  law  enforcement  to  capture  data  that  could  be used against any citizen may be excessive and violate individual rights to privacy. Thus, legislators and law enforcement agencies alike must walk a fine line when developing new methods to prosecute or pursue cybercriminals.  640   At the global level, there is also a need for improved international mechanisms to help combat serious financial and hacking-related cybercrimes. As noted in Chapter 8,  there are a number of working groups that exist to coordinate transnational responses to child exploitation crimes. There are few similar entities to pursue hacking and fraud-related crimes, making it difficult to effectively sanction and deter offenders. In fact, the lack of resources may account for the continuing number of mass data breaches that also foster the global market for stolen data  Peretti, 2009 .  One  way  to  expand  the  response  to  cybercrime  is  through  the  integration  of corporations  and  private  industry  that  either  own  or  control  sensitive  systems  and networks  Wall, 2007 . In fact, corporations like Microsoft have formed working groups to  combat  cybercrimes  through  the  creation  of  their  Digital  Crimes  Unit   Adhikari, 2013 . This unit recently worked with law enforcement agencies in the USA and Europe to  track  the  addresses  of  computers  infected  with  the  ZeroAccess  botnet  malware  and push security updates to those systems to disrupt the size of the network. This effort was combined with a civil lawsuit filed by Microsoft against the botnet operator, which was eventually  dropped  after  the  company  was  able  to  work  with  law  enforcement  to directly identify infected systems. Such a strategy is interesting, as it means that victim systems  can  be  cleaned  and  repaired  without  the  need  to  directly  arrest  the  botnet operator.  At  the  same  time,  this  technique  actually  harmed  legitimate  computer  users whose systems were not infected but were associated with the infected nodes  Adhikari, 2013 .  In  addition,  there  are  substantive  questions  concerning  the  impact  of  corporate entities  playing  a  major  role  in  the  investigation  of  cyber-crimes  and  how  this  may diminish the perceived ability of law enforcement.  For  more  on  http:  blogs.microsoft.com blog 2013 12 19 zeroaccess-criminals-wave-white-flag- the-impact-of-partnerships-on-cybercrime .  the  Microsoft  Digital  Crimes  Unit,  go  online   to:  An  additional  strategy  that  some  have  proposed  to  aid  in  the  investigation  and prosecution  of  cybercrimes  internationally  is  to  develop  an  international  criminal tribunal for cyberspace that can sanction offenders  Schjolberg, 2012 . The formation of a truly international court that would represent the victim nations could be a valuable tool to pursue cases where multiple nations were affected by a group of actors. There is  641   also  a  precedent  for  the  use  of  tribunals  at  the  international  level,  such  as  the International  Criminal  Court,  to  provide  a  venue  for  prosecution   Schjolberg,  2012 . There are substantive concerns among nations that such a strategy could both hinder the investigation of cybercrimes and obviate justice mechanisms within their own nations. Furthermore,  there  is  a  high  probability  that  not  all  nations  would  be  willing  to participate in a tribunal owing to the perceived legitimacy of such a body. Thus, it is not clear if such a strategy can ever truly be implemented in the real world.  642   Summary  Computers  and  the  Internet  have  radically  changed  how  we  communicate,  engage  in business, and interact with the larger world, in a very short space of time. The benefits of these technologies are substantial, though they also create a range of threats to personal safety and national security. As a result, we have to continuously identify these threats and the ways in which technologies are being abused by offenders to facilitate criminal behaviors. Only then can we improve our understanding of the influence of technology on  the  nature  of  crime  and  deviance  in  the  twenty-first  century  and  better  protect ourselves.

This book offers a comprehensive and integrative introduction to cybercrime. It provides an authoritative synthesis of the disparate literature on the various types of cybercrime, the global investigation and detection of cybercrime and the role of digital information, and the wider role of technology as a facilitator for social relationships between deviants and criminals. It includes coverage of: key theoretical and methodological perspectives; computer hacking and malicious software; digital piracy and intellectual theft; economic crime and online fraud; pornography and online sex crime; cyber-bullying and cyber-stalking; cyber-terrorism and extremism; digital forensic investigation and its legal context around the world; the law enforcement response to cybercrime transnationally; cybercrime policy and legislation across the globe. The new edition features two new chapters, the first looking at the law enforcement response to cybercrime and the second offering an extended discussion of online child pornography and sexual exploitation. This book includes lively and engaging features, such as discussion questions, boxed examples of unique events and key figures in offending, quotes from interviews with active offenders, and a full glossary of terms. This new edition includes QR codes throughout to connect directly with relevant websites. It is supplemented by a companion website that includes further exercises for students and instructor resources. This text is essential reading for courses on cybercrime, cyber-deviancy, digital forensics, cybercrime investigation, and the sociology of technology.
