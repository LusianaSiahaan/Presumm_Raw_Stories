Corporations create a large amount of unstructured content  in the form of documents, scanned content, videos, audio, photos, images, and so  on. Some statistics show that more than 80 percent of a corporation's intellectual  property exists in the form of unstructured data. If that much of a corporation's  intellectual property exists in an unstructured format how much time do employees  spend searching the corporate network to locate and gather information? How much  disk space do we consume saving copy after copy, revision upon revision of content  only so we can find it later just to find we forgot where we put it?  This is where ECM system comes in to play. They are designed to manage  unstructured content, provide search tools, enforce content security rules, web  publishing, provide repository services to business systems, and many other  functions depending on product offerings and corporate needs.  This book focuses on the ECM products offered by Oracle. In 2007 Oracle acquired  Stellent, and has been working to integrate the Content Server into the entire Oracle  product line. Oracle's vision is to offer a complete application stack integrating all the  applications any organization needs to operate from top to bottom. Oracle has taken  the Content Server core and plugged it into the Fusion Middleware stack giving  repository services capability to all the enterprise business systems Oracle owns.  As UCM grows in adoption in organizations administrators are faced with managing  a system that may be rapidly growing in usage creating a huge demands for  UCM services. Understanding Oracle UCM, how it works, how to set it up and  administration is essential to having an ECM system that performs and provides  services expected by the end users.   There are many books about ECM and ECM systems in general but very few that  cover Oracle Content Management products. If you want to learn about the Oracle  Content Management system you would need to attend training classes or pour over  the Oracle documentation to find out the information you need to install and set up  UCM. This book condenses the Oracle documentation into short and understandable  descriptions, and step by step instructions about how to set up, configure, and  understand the workings of Oracle UCM version 10gR3. The language used by  the author is very understandable and each topic is explained in plain talk, which  makes the context of the book easy to understand by new as well as experienced  administrators and users. This book does not cover hardware configurations and  setup which is an entirely separate topic that depends on your organizations  preferences for OS types, hardware manufacturer, and requirements but it will get  you up and running and ready to manage your content once the hardware resources  have been installed and configured to run in your organizations environment.  I  don't understand what this sentence is trying to say!! All you need to do is open it  up to any page and start reading. If you are an experienced administrator you will  see how informational the book is. If you are a new to Oracle UCM you will enjoy  getting right to the workings of Oracle UCM and quickly get to setting up your new  UCM environment.

Chapter 11, Web Content Management and Collaboration, is your complete step by  step walkthrough of creating killer websites with Site Studio Designer. It walks  you through the server-site set up, and how to best use templates, regions, and  fragments.  [ 3 ]   Preface  Appendix A, Exploring Oracle UCM Product Offering, gives you an in-depth review  of the entire Oracle UCM Product Offering, insider tips, strongest sides, and the  caveats you need to be aware of—when using dozens of products and components  within the UCM Suite  and how to avoid missing the cut by picking a wrong tool   for the job . Appendix B, Detailed Oracle UCM Resource Directory, is your instant access to many  valuable print and online resources, trusted system integrators, UCM training  providers and more. Here're just a few categories of resources you will find in  Appendix B:   	 Free online resources—a comprehensive listing of UCM-specific and general   content-management related blogs, review, and article sites. Many of these  hidden gems are not actively promoted and you won't pick them up from a  Google search.   	 Best recommended publications—the few UCM-related books and   whitepapers you may find really useful some even indispensable.   	 Trusted System Integrators—a small list of time-tested, good track record   Oracle Partners that specialize in the UCM space.   	 Trusted Training Providers—just like the System Integrators, this is a small  list of vendors you can start with if you're looking for official or customized  Oracle UCM training.   	 Value-Added Products and Services—a list of products that may help you  avoid expensive customizations or save you time on content migration and  other time consuming initiatives.  Be sure to check your Resource Directory when you are done reading the chapters.  And now let's see what kind of hardware and software you will need to run the  examples and follow the tutorials from this book.  What you need for this book If you want to build your own local copy of the Content Server, to run the examples  and follow the tutorials in this book, you will need a Windows  2000, XP, Vista, or  Windows 7  desktop or laptop with 5 GB of free disk space and at least, 1GB of RAM.  You can also use your existing development or sandbox environment running Oracle  Content Server v.10g R3, in which case all you need on your local machine is a web  browser.  And now let's get right into the Eight-hour Quick Start System.  [ 4 ]   Preface  Eight-hour quick start system Welcome to the eight hours quick start! This section is different—it's here to give  you a rocket boost to help you get comfortable with Oracle UCM in a hurry. If you  are "under the gun" to decide if your project can be accomplished with UCM or you  found yourself on a deep end of the pool of a UCM implementation—this section  will be the helping hand you need.  Even though the book you're reading right now is the fastest way to master Oracle  UCM I know about, this may still not be "fast enough" for what you're trying to  accomplish. So how do we force-feed the UCM expertise directly into your brain?  The answer may shock and delight you.  We will rely on the famous 80 20 rule. 80 percent of what you really need to learn  only takes 20 percent of time to master. The rest of the time is spent on the remaining  20 percent of knowledge!  In this section I'll help you identify the knowledge you need and help you find it  within this book at maximum speed.  Ready? Let's get into it. But first, I want to tell you something that will help you get  even better results.  Five reasons to feel excited about learning  Oracle UCM I want you to feel this way because you picked a very good product to master.   Here's why:   	 Oracle is a great company, leader in the marketplace, and offers great   support.   	   	 The UCM itself has been around for 14 years, has thousands of happy   customers and you'll come to appreciate its speed, simplicity, and reliability. I actually challenge you to find an enterprise level UCM solution that can  run completely on 512 MB of RAM, fit on a 1 GB flash drive, and run on an  outdated laptop! And offer comparable response speed. Most of the tools  today are bloated, take an enormous amount of hardware and are slow. Not  every laptop or even desktop will let you run a copy or SharePoint 2007.  Certainly, not—if you have 2 GB or RAM!  [ 5 ]   Preface   	  It doesn't take a lot of effort to configure and learn, which you can actually  see by the size of this book! It's not that another thousand page volume with  a hundred of pages of dedicated to installation and configuration.   	 And it doesn't take two weeks just to get up and running.  In fact, in the first  chapter I'll show you how to build and configure your own Content Server in  a short afternoon .  So let's take a look at your eight-hour Quick Start System.  What are you going to learn? There are two types of facts you'll be acquiring today. The basic concepts behind  Oracle UCM, that unlock the rest of the knowledge for you, and additional stuff   that your project at hand may urgently require.  Required information that you must internalize No matter what you're planning on doing with Oracle UCM, you need to start with   the Content Server. All major UCM modules, such as Document Management, Web  Content Management, and Records Management are all based on it.  The best way to get started and understand the base Content Server paradigms is by  reading the introduction in Chapter 1. Easily enough, it's called "Here's an easy way  to understand the Content Server".  If you're in a rush, don't install your local copy of Content Server at this  point. Just flip through the pages and focus on introductions, summaries,  headers, and illustrations. Not sure what this sentence is trying to say! When you're learning at  a maximum speed, you need to go for the "bird eye" view of all of the  content.  Once you have a feel for how it works, take it a bit deeper and learn more about  metadata and security. These are the two most important aspects of any Content  Server implementation, and the one that you must understand in order to succeed.  I'm not asking you to carefully read and study the chapters at this point. You're after  the "what" question, not the "how". Flip through the pages and see:   	 What metadata is used for   	 What's involved in creating a metadata model  [ 6 ]   Preface   	 What are the basic concepts of Content Server Security   	 How different security components fit together  At this point, you will find yourself a lot more comfortable and ready to focus on  your specific UCM assignment.  Other stuff you might find useful If you plan on doing some hands-on Content Server administration, review   Chapter 2, Major Controls. This will get you instantly familiar with operations,  diagnostics, and UCM troubleshooting, and show you how to manage users. If you are planning on customizing Oracle UCM, skim Chapter 7 and Chapter 10.  This will give you important insights about the inner workings of Content Server,   its key file formats and all the tools, and choices you have for customizing its  interface and behavior.  And if you are working or planning to work with a vendor then be sure to review   the section called Five ways to maximize results and avoid disaster when working with  a UCM vendor in Chapter 10. These street-tough project success tips will help you  reduce your risk and avoid severe penalties to your budget, timeline, and your  system functionality. And last, but not least, I urge you to scan through Appendix A and get yourself  familiar with the entire Oracle UCM product line up. Not only you will see how  other modules integrate with Content Server, you will see what other tools and  integration options you have at your disposal.  That's it. How did you do? Still have a bit of time left of your eight hours? Then how  about some activity? Why not have a little fun with actually installing your own local  copy of the Content Server? Or you can simply skim Chapter 1 and see what it takes  to install.  Quick start summary Congratulations! You've just accomplished something that a vast majority  of technical people cannot even dream possible. You've got yourself a solid  understanding of Oracle UCM—in just under eight short hours. I agree, you   may not be ready to take over a high volume production environment, but I'm   sure, you can find your way around it.  So now, let's pick up everything we've left off in the first reading. Let's get some  practice and get you bumped up to next level of Oracle UCM mastery.  [ 7 ]   Preface  And before I see you in Chapter 1, let's take one quick important step that will  literally put your learning on auto-pilot and help you achieve your career objectives  faster than you ever dreamed possible.  Your fastest way to Oracle UCM mastery You will soon be finished with the book material, but it doesn't mean you will  not continue to benefit from it for years to come, and I don't mean re-reading the  chapters when you need a refresher. That goes without saying…   What I do mean is the fact that any book is limited in what the author can relate to  you. And you need a steady flow of insider information to keep you up in the top  ranks of your chosen filed, any field. And Oracle UCM is no exception.  That's why, to thank you for investing in this book, I've set aside your own private  and personal spot in the Independent Oracle UCM Knowledge Center.

[ 12 ]   Getting Up and Running  In this chapter you will accomplish two important objectives—you will build your  own portable Oracle Universal Content Management  Oracle UCM  environment  and you will understand the basics of the Content Server and major Content  Management paradigms. More specifically, you will learn:   	 How to obtain your free unlimited evaluation version of Oracle    UCM products   	 How to set up the Content Server in just an hour or two, and how to    steer clear of nasty installation problems   	 A maximum speed introduction to Content Server that will make you    instantly familiar  and comfortable  with it   	 Required knowledge and basic principles you must internalize—about  Content Management in general, that will help you avoid devastating   losses, no matter what CMS tool you use  Ready? Let's get started with a quick overview.  Installation overview A few years ago, we made a mistake during a server upgrade and had to spend two  days restoring from a tape backup. Technology changed since then and you can  avoid our mistakes. Now you have more memory in a basic laptop than we had in  our servers!  You can have a copy of your entire production environment run on a single machine  and you can "dry-run" important upgrades and installations, before you even  consider applying them to your live production servers.   Getting Up and Running  And it doesn't even take a lot of resources. So why not put your spare RAM to good  use? Let's bring up Oracle Content Server in a virtual environment. What do I mean by "virtual environment"? Let's see this in more detail.  Quick primer on virtual environments  A Virtual Machine  a VM  is "an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real machine."   Source: Wikipedia  It's an image of a physical machine. For example, if you use Microsoft Virtual PC,  it runs in its own process and looks like a window on the desktop—like a Remote  Desktop Connection window.  It has its own virtual hard disk or two, its own virtual network connections,   and much more. You can even run a web server on a VM and browse it from   your desktop. The physical machine running VMs is called a host machine. You can in fact back up your server or your workstation and restore that image into   a VM, and run that virtual machine on your laptop or desktop computer.  You can have multiple machines running at the same time or you can have the entire  server farm running off your laptop  as shown in the following screenshot .  [ 14 ]   Chapter 1  Host Machine  Database Server Database Server  Web Server Web Server  Web Server  Application Server Application Server  Virtual Environment  Application Server  Database Server  We will be using this feature in the following chapters.  Running Oracle Content Server in a virtual environment offers you some important  benefits that can slash days and even weeks off your learning curve:   	 You can always undo anything that went wrong.  	 Guest OS, the VM's Operating System has absolutely no affect and may  even have no access to your host. Even if you're running a deadly virus   on your VM you may be completely safe.   	 You'll be able to take the VM with you; moving it to another machine is    a simple file copy operation.  I hope I have you convinced. And now it's time to get our tools ready.  [ 15 ]   Getting Up and Running  Get your tools ready Let's get ready to install Oracle UCM.  Content Server can work with a number of different databases. I suggest we use  Microsoft SQL Server. Why?  Because chances are that you are running Windows and familiar with basic  administration. Also, Microsoft offers an evaluation version of SQL Server, so   you won't have to spend time installing the OS and a database server.  You can download SQL Server 2005 on Windows 2003 Server—installed and   pre-configured for you in a virtual environment. It's ready to use.  All you need to do is get Oracle Content Server, and install it on this VM. In fact,   I am going to walk you through the process.  Download your test VM I'm not giving you the exact link because links change quite often. Type these words  in Google: download SQL server VHD.  What's VHD? It's an extension of Virtual Hard Disk files that you can run with  Microsoft Virtual PC.  Find a link from a Microsoft site and download your virtual machine.  You will need Microsoft Virtual PC to run it. Again, right now, the current version   is 2007. It's a free download from Microsoft site. Type into Google: download Microsoft virtual PC. You'll get the download link. Install Virtual PC on a machine where you will be running your VMs.  How much RAM should you have? I recommend that you have at least 512 MB of RAM that you  have to spare on top of your daily essentials. 1 GB on the host  is the minimum.  Once you have the VHD unzipped and Microsoft virtual PC 2007 installed on your  machine—you're ready to run your VM.  The last thing you need is the actual copy of the Content Server.  [ 16 ]   Getting a copy of Oracle UCM To get the Oracle UCM follow these steps:  1.  Go to http:  edelivery.oracle.com . Here you will get a page as   shown in the following screenshot; click on Continue:  Chapter 1  2.  Enter your first and last name and your company information. Accept the   terms and click on Continue to proceed. In the next page, select Oracle Fusion Middleware as the product pack and  Microsoft Windows  32 bit  as platform and click on Go.  3.   4.  Pick Oracle® Enterprise Content Management 10g Release 3  10.1.3  Media   Pack and click on Continue.  5.  Now out of the available options download Oracle Content Server 10gR3    10.1.3.3.3  for Microsoft Windows  32-bit .  While your Content Server is downloading, we can use the time for getting   the VM ready.  [ 17 ]   Getting Up and Running Getting the VM ready for Content Server In this section I'll walk you through the steps of using MS Virtual PC 2007 to run the  VHD file you've just downloaded, and how to configure it best to save time when  you will be installing the Content Server.  Let's get started:  1.  Run Virtual PC 2007. 2.  Click on New...; New Virtual Machine Wizard opens. 3.  Click on Next. 4.  Choose Use default settings to create a virtual machine as shown in the   following screenshot:  5.  Give the VM a name and a location.  [ 18 ]   Chapter 1  How to save a few gigabytes of disk space I recommend putting a VM in an NTFS compressed folder. The default  location is My Virtual Machines in My Documents folder. You can  compress that to save a few gigabytes. Remember, VMs are the images of  actual machines. Files get pretty large.  6.  Click on Next. 7.  Click on Finish. Virtual Machine settings dialog opens. 8.  Give your VM 512 or 1024 MB of RAM depending on how much RAM    you have to spare.  9.  Select Hard Disk 1 as shown in the following screenshot:  10.  Click on Virtual Disk Wizard. 11.  Click on Next; leave Create a new virtual disk selected. 12.  Pickle A virtual hard disk and click on Next.  [ 19 ]   Getting Up and Running  13.  Pick a location. I recommend putting it in the same folder where you created   your VM. See the following screenshot:  14.  Now click on Next. 15.  Pick Differencing as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 20 ]   Chapter 1  16.  Pick the parent VHD file—the one you downloaded from Microsoft. 17.  Keep Undo Disks disabled for now. 18.  Click on OK to close settings dialog. 19.  On a Virtual PC Console click on Start button.  Watch your VM start... Aren't you excited yet?  1.  Once the VM displays a login prompt—log in with Administrator   and a password from Readme.htm that came with the VHD. Mine was  Evaluation1.  2.  Open SQL Server Management Studio. 3.  Click on Connect. 4.  Expand Security Logins on the tree view on your left. 5.  Right-click on Logins. Pick New Login. 6.  Create a user that your Content Server will use to connect to SQL Server.   Make sure you use SQL Server authentication and Enforce password  expiration is off.   [ 21 ]   Getting Up and Running  7.  Right-click on Databases and pick New Database. 8.  Give it a name. Make sure you specify the user you've just created as   database owner:  Your SQL Server database is now ready.  1.  Once download of Content Server is complete, unzip the file. You  will see an inner ZIP file, named something like: ContentServer_ Windows_10gR3_20080807.zip.  2.  Drag it over the VM's desktop. That will copy the file over to the VM.    Unzip it there to an easy-to-find folder, like c:\install.  3.  On your host machine browse to http:  jtds.sourceforge.net .   Go Download. Save jtds-1.2.x-dist.zip.  4.  Go inside the file and extract jtds-1.2.x.jar.  [ 22 ]   5.  Drag the .jar  NOT .zip  file over to your VM. Place it into the   installation directory.  The installation directory on your VM should look something like this:  Chapter 1  Great! You've now completed all the pre-work and are ready to install a copy of  Content Server.  Wait! There's something else I want you to do. I bet you'll like the next step.  In case you make a mistake and would like to re-run the installation—I don't want  you to go through all the steps you just completed. Virtual PC gives us the power to  save you from doing that.  1.  Click on Windows Start button and shutdown your VM. 2.  Once it stops running, go the Settings and enable Undo Disks. 3.  Start the VM.  Now you can always get back to the "Ready to install" step in just a few seconds!  Suppose you made a mistake and would like to start over. Just click on the X on the  top right corner of the VM window and pick Turn off and delete changes. When  you start the VM, it will be back in the state in which it last started!  [ 23 ]   Getting Up and Running  Say, your VM with Undo Disks enabled was infected and completely destroyed by a  virus. All you need to do is Turn off and delete changes  as shown in the following  screenshot ! Love it! The power of Undo Disks…  Don't pick Turn off and delete changes unless you really want to go  back. You can lose your work!  I hope you're not out of steam yet! It was a long prep-work. Normally, if you just  install the UCM on a physical server, you'll be starting in the Lab 1 section. Just   trust me, getting your VM ready was time well spent. You'll thank me later!  Lab 1: Install content server Welcome to the actual Content Server installation process! It's time to benefit from  all that prep work:  1.  Start the VM. 2.  Once it is started, in your installation directory there go to    UCM\ContentServer\win32.  3.  Start installer.exe. The Installer opens as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 24 ]   Chapter 1  Installer is a cross-platform application. It looks the same on UNIX and   Windows. It takes a few seconds to get used to, but it has its own   advantages.... In case you didn't guess, an asterisk designates a currently selected option. If  you're OK to proceed just press Enter. If you need to change the option, type  in the new choice and then press Enter.  Just keep on pressing Enter to accept default choices for all directories.  4.  *1. Install new server—just press Enter. The default choice is fine. 5.  Hit Enter to install in a default directory. 6.  Hit Enter to go with default JVM. 7.  8.  Hit Enter to pick default option that is*1. Configure as a master server. 9.  Keep going with defaults until you see a database selection prompt. It reads  "Please select a database from the list below to use with the  Content Server. Content Server Database".  10.  Type 2 then hit Enter. You're choosing Microsoft SQL Server 2005. 11.  JDBC driver classname []:—use net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver. 12.  JDBC connection string []—use jdbc:jtds:sqlserver:    Win2k3R2EE:1433 OracleUCM; I assume your machine name is win2k3R2EE  and your database name is OracleUCM.  13.  Database User ID—type up the user ID you picked for your database. If   you followed the screenshots, you should have UCM for yours.  14.  Specify the DB password.  [ 25 ]   Getting Up and Running  15.  JDBC driver .jar file path []—type the path to the JAR file that was  inside that ZIP folder you downloaded from SourceForge. If you followed  my instructions—use C:\install\jtds-1.2.4.jar.  16.  Go with defaults to Copy JDBC driver files, Attempt to create database   tables and Use Unicode text fields.  17.  The installer asks you to select components to install. Hit 1 then Enter  to select Content Folios. Also select Folders_g. Hit F and then Enter to  continue.  18.  Pick default under Configure the Administration Server service. 19.  Pick 2 to say No to Configure the admin service to run as a specific   user. This will have a service run as a Local System on Windows.   20.  Continue with the default No for Configure admin service to be dependent   21.  Default to Configure the Content Server service. *1. Install service and   on another service.  start automatically is fine.  22.  Pick 2 to say No to Configure the service to run as a specific user. 23.  Continue with default choices but don't proceed with the install yet.  Right before you proceed be sure to check the content of C:\oracle\ucm\server\ install\log.txt. Right-click on it and open it with WordPad. as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 26 ]   Oops! You bet I'm happy I didn't go ahead now. I've accidentally added a space in  my JDBC connection string as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 1  If you see errors in log.txt—choose Change Configuration and correct the  mistakes. It will be even easier this time around. All the choices you made are   still there and you'll just have to keep on pressing Enter. Choose Proceed to continue with the installation. Once install is complete, check the log file once again. Search for the word  Error. If you see errors, you'll know what went wrong and what to expect  from the installation.  We just completed installation of a fresh instance of Content Server.  You can later use a similar procedure for upgrades. You can also  install additional Content Server instances on the same machine.  [ 27 ]   Getting Up and Running How to hold on to your success Hopefully, you have no errors in your log.txt file and your installation was  successful. Now it's a good time to take a snapshot of your VM. Why?  So you can feel safe about playing with it. You'll always be able to get back to this  "just installed" state.  Here's how you do it. Click on Windows Start button on your VM and shut it down.  When shutdown is complete, you have a choice of committing or discarding the  changes you made to the machine since the last save. Pick Commit changes to the  virtual hard disk as shown in the following screenshot:  Congratulations! You've just completed your installation. Now let me show   you around.  Here's an easy way to understand the  Content Server Oracle Content Server is the foundation of Oracle Universal Content Management  Suite. It's the center product. Other major UCM modules, such as Web Content  Management and Document Management are built on top of it.  Think of the Content Server as a central database for storing content. A database  analogy is the easiest way to understand it.  In fact, you can think of a Content Server as one huge table that can store millions   of records.  [ 28 ]   Chapter 1  And the only major difference between Content Server and a database server is the  fact that every record in it has revisions and can go through the workflow. Every row in the table would be a single content item. Every field in that row would  be a metadata field—just like in a table in SQL Server or Oracle or MySQL, or any  other database you are comfortable with.  And just like a row in a table you can add and remove fields to fit your   organization's requirements.  Every database, as you know, has standard or system fields. And just the same way  Oracle Content Server has pre-defined metadata fields; the system metadata fields. It  also has custom metadata fields. Let's take a quick look:  1.  On your VM, go to http:  localhost idc. You'll see a login screen as seen   in the screenshot below.  [ 29 ]   Getting Up and Running  2.  Click on the Login link. Type sysadmin for user name and idc for  the password. Your Content Server Home page loads as shown in   the following screenshot:  3.  Now click on New Check In. The check-in form loads as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 30 ]   Chapter 1  Ugly, isn't it? Imagine getting your end users to fill a form like this every time they  have a document to check in! The good news is that you can easily personalize this  form with custom rules and only show the fields you want your users to see.  [ 31 ]   Getting Up and Running  Did you notice that some of the field names have an asterisk in front of them? Yes,  those values are required, but in our case, those are system fields. Here's a quick  description of some of the major metadata fields you'll be sure to deal with:   	 Content ID: A unique identifier of the content item in the system.  	 Type  content type : A built-in metadata field that allows you to specify  a broad category for this content item, such as "Vendor Invoice", "Human  Resources", or "Project Plan".   	 Security Group: A metadata field that controls an item's security. I will   give you later in the following chapters.   	 Comments: A place for extra info about the content item. This filed is   custom or extended metadata.   	 Release Date: The date this item is "released" into the system. In most   cases, that would be the date of its original check in.  Custom metadata fields are the ones that you can define and manage and even delete  if you wish. System metadata fields, such as content ID or title, are part of the system  and are required for Content Server to function properly.  You can use metadata values to find content in the database and you can search by  any combination of fields. Content Server even has a simple, almost SQL-like query  language. Or you can search by individual field just like in Windows Explorer you  can search files by name or modification dates.   But that's where the similarity ends. Unlike Windows Explorer, you don't necessarily  have a folder structure in Content Server. The actual content store is flat like a  database table.  But most organizations prefer to use hierarchies such as shared drives, file plans,  retention schedules, and so on. Can you continue to use them with Content Server?  Yes, you can!  Your users can continue benefiting from taxonomies, from the knowledge your  organization has accumulated, and you can continue using that filing system if it   still works well for business folks. Each content item may be associated with a virtual folder. Remember, the content is  not physically stored in that folder. It is just linked to it so that users can also find it  that way—in addition to using the search feature.  Virtual folders provide users a convenient and familiar metaphor for storage and  classification. Content Server folders may be browsed just like other, familiar systems.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 1  We will have a longer discussion on Virtual Folders once we get to Chapter 7, Under  the Hood.  How to get content in If you click on the quick search button on the top right of your screen, you will see  that your Content Server is empty. Let's check something in. On the check-in screen find the Primary File field and click on the Browse button.  Pick any small file, like readme.htm. Specify values for the required fields and  click on the Check In button at the bottom. The Check in Confirmation dialog is  displayed as shown in the following screenshot:  Now wait for 30 seconds or so for the new file to get indexed. Click on the Quick  Search button at the top right corner. Your newly checked-in content should appear  in the search results:  [ 33 ]   Getting Up and Running  There are multiple ways to contribute content. Using the check-in form is one of the   most popular.  Remember, you can make the check-in form look almost any way you like with just  a few minutes of simple configuration. And you can have multiple versions of the  form—for different types of content you check in... We will take a deeper look at the  Metadata in Chapter 4, Understanding Security.  The building blocks of a content   management system I mean, important things you need to understand, even if you use SharePoint, Open  Text, or Interwoven, there're some things all ECM systems have in common.  I'm not going to bore you with a long tutorial in ECM. Let me just give you the core  concepts you need to understand and keep in mind when designing your system.  Storage paradigms Storage paradigms are how your data is represented in the system. How your users  interact with it. How they find content.  There are two major storage paradigms; Relational and Hierarchical. Let's take a   look at these one by one.  Relational This is your conventional database like SQL Server, Oracle or MySQL. Tables can  refer to values from other tables like a customers table and table of their orders.  This is what Content Server Store is like. Don't expect the values to "propagate from  the parent", that's something the other storage paradigm would do.  Hierarchical This is what a typical file system is like. Remember Windows Explorer... This goes  back to our discussion of virtual folders earlier in this chapter. Just remember that hierarchy in Content Server is virtual. This will help you a lot  when planning metadata and permissions.  [ 34 ]   Chapter 1  Metadata Metadata is the description of data. When you buy a book, you want to know the  author, the title, and publication date. This is metadata. The title of the movie and  names of the actors are metadata. The names of the songs you see in your CD player  are metadata. Without it, you won't be able to pick a book by its title, won't know  who's playing in the movie until you have watched it, and won't know the title of the   song you're listening to. Metadata is extremely important. In Chapter 4, I'll show you how to define and  use custom fields, and how to make your check-in form look exactly the way   you want it.  And the last building block I want you to look at is the Content lifecycle.  Content lifecycle Here's what Content Management really mean. Your business can only benefit  from an ECM system when these four stages of content lifecycle are in place:  Contribution The system cannot manage content that it doesn't know about. So you need to  ask your system to take in a document or a web page before it becomes managed  content. This is what a process of Check In does for you.  Once checked-in, the content item is in storage.  Storage The system stores the content in its repository, or links it to external content store. In  any event, each record in the repository, each content item has metadata associated  with it.  Once stored, the content item is ready for consumption.  Consumption This is when your content begins to bring business value. If you have a Word  document in the repository and would like that content to display on a web page,  Dynamic Converter, a Content Server component, can create a web-viewable rendition.  If you'd like a PDF version to send out to customers, a PDF Converter component  will do just that. And you don't need to update three different copies. One document  can have many renditions.  [ 35 ]   Getting Up and Running  Once the content reaches the end of its life cycle, it's ready for disposition.  Disposition When an employee terminates, his or her profile needs to be taken out of the  company directory. Old files that are no longer used are wasting your disk space   and indexing cycles.  When a corporate deal is complete, you don't want to keep your records longer than  required by law. Some of the files may have information that, in case of a lawsuit,  you'd much rather had been destroyed. But people forget and the content may still  be there. A delight for an opposing party's law firm!  So Content Server gives you expiry and archiving controls  We'll be looking at those  in Chapter 4 and Chapter 10, Customizing Oracle UCM . If you need more functionality,  Oracle offers a Content Server add-on for a DOD 5015.2-compliant Records  Management System.  Top 3 common rollout mistakes that spell  "failure" in any UCM project These are more fundamental mistakes than security flaws and bad hardware  choices. I'm talking project killers, things that are sure to take your project under.  And the worst thing of all is when your new Oracle UCM is not accepted by your  organization. If that happens—your project is finished! When people don't like  your system, they won't be using it. When they are not using the system, no one can  benefit from it. End of story.  Now, let's look a little deeper. What does it take to get people to use it? Let's consider  the requirements.  Integration into organization culture Oracle UCM just like SharePoint, Vignette, BroadVision, you name it, is just a  framework. All it does is allow you, the designer, to quickly and easily automate  business processes. Eliminate paper. Help them find the information faster. Destroy  when it has to be destroyed.  You need to adjust your content collection, management, and presentation systems  to the processes and demands of your organization. That's the real goal, not the  software installation!  So guess what comes first?  [ 36 ]   Chapter 1  If you misunderstand your organization's culture, processes, and business  requirements, no system out there will save your project.  Take the time to understand the real needs of business people. Understand the   goals of your enterprise. Then go ahead and automate them. You won't be stuck  trying to automate a bad process!  Be sure to read about Iterative Development  later in this chapter.   Another fatal mistake commonly found in failed UCM rollouts is bad Metadata design.  Metadata design Once you've identified your business clients and spent time understanding their  needs, you're ready to reflect your knowledge in a content management system.   And you do this through metadata design and workflows.  As you've seen earlier in this chapter, metadata design is all about creating custom  fields. Fields that describe various types of content you'll be storing in the system.  For example, if you store Project Plans, you might like to add a project manager's  name, completion date, and expense account number.  And remember, if users don't understand the purpose of a metadata field, they'll   skip it, put wrong stuff in there, or just type up some garbage, so the system lets  them submit the form.  Here are some tips for successful metadata design, expensive to ignore. Don't ask for all of your fields every time If they check in an employee record and you're asking them for PM name, guess  what kind of name you'll get. It must make sense. And it also must be as quick  and painless as possible. Business people are busy and many perceive content  management as a "necessary evil", even "pain in the neck", so if you don't have to   ask them for a specific field value don't.  Now if you don't need a user's input on a specific field, consider hiding it. On the   other hand, if you do need their input, consider using validation.  Another great thing you can do is take advantage of features that let you  pre-populate metadata values, features such as Content Profiles  covered in  detail in Chapter 4 , Content categorizer  see Appendix A , or the Multi-Field  Configuration Utility from Fishbowl Solutions  www.FishbowlSolutions.com  StellentSolutions .  [ 37 ]   Getting Up and Running Beware of the snowball effect This is what happens when you ignore the previous rule.  Picture yourself having a nicely configured system with clean data. Every document  has correct meta values. Now you begin asking for a field that doesn't make sense.  Your contributors will begin putting garbage there and they'll be putting garbage in  other fields as well! How?  Once you have put garbage in one field, say 'asdf', it becomes very easy to simply  put that in the rest of the fields all the way down the form. The system will soon   become polluted and you might end up losing the meta values for your entire  repository. Why?   You won't know which records have the real values and which just garbage.  Soon enough you won't be able to trust the data anymore!  Keep an eye on what content is getting entered and always keep communicating  with your business users. Know this single, most expensive type of UCM activity The single most expensive UCM activity is manual Cleansing and Matching. Unless  you have an army of data analysts looking for stuff to do, I don't recommend letting  your project get to this point. You must prevent it almost at any cost.  And here is one more common way organizations kill their content management  projects. It's by ignoring the principles of iterative development.  Iterative development You can still afford to delay the rollout until you have all the knowledge you need  to design your new system. It doesn't have to be chunked into large and expensive  phases—expensive and vulnerable to scope creep.  You can easily implement a useful system while you're still acquiring knowledge.  The key here is to have a live working system in the hands of your business people  as soon as you possibly can.  All you need to do is make small incremental changes such as adding different types  of documents, new modules, new workflows, and so on.  [ 38 ]   Chapter 1  And listen to feedback. If business is happy you did great. If not all you have   to undo is just a small change! So don't try to bite off more than you can chew.   If you need more info on agile and iterative development processes, Wikipedia   www.wikipedia.org  is a good place to start. Just search for "Agile software  development". Congratulations!  Summary You now have a fully functional instance of Oracle Content Server. You've checked  in your first document and you know what metadata is all about.  You've seen the main reasons why so many UCM rollouts fail.  In the next chapter I'll give you a deluxe tour of Content Server. We will look at all  the major controls and learn the frequently used features.  [ 39 ]    Major Controls   By the end of this chapter you will find yourself feeling a lot more comfortable   with Content Server, and much closer to becoming independent of any outside  consulting help.  You will learn the core administration and operations of content server. More  specifically, you will learn:   	 How to check and update server configuration, what configuration settings   are available, and which ones do you need to look at for your task at hand   	 How to troubleshoot Content Server and where to find vital diagnostic    	 How to add and remove users from the system and how to update    information  user information   	 What other ways you can use to bring in new content  Before you know it, this chapter will take you to the next level of understanding of  Oracle Content Server. It won't take you nearly as long as Content Server installation!  Let's get into this.  Where to start? Before we get into turning the knobs and pulling on the levers let me mention that  there are two major groups of controls out there, Administration and Operations.  Content Server doesn't draw a clear border between them. The reason I focus on  this is simple—Administration deals with changing the way things work, while  Operations deals with keeping things up and running. It pays to keep those separate.   Major Controls   If you didn't already do so then log into your Content Server and expand the  Administration tray on the left  as shown in the following screenshot :  If your screen doesn't look like one shown on the screenshot, one of two  things might've happened: If you do see the trays on the left, but just don't see Admistration then  you're not logging in as sysadmin. Close all of your browser windows  and log in again to Content Server as sysadmin. If you don't see any trays on the left of your screen, you might've changed  your preferred screen layout in your personalization settings. Click on the  My Profile link on the top  shown in the previous screenshot , and under  the User Personalization Settings group, change the value in the Layout  dropdown to Trays.  [ 42 ]   Chapter 2  You're now looking at the main Content Server administration controls. Let's see  how you can use them.  View or change configuration Administration Controls define how things work in Content Server. Let's look at  them one by one:  Admin Applets Click on Admin Applets on the left. The Admin Applets Screen loads on your right,  which can be seen in the next screenshot:  If you get broken image icons instead, you may need to re-install the  Java Plug-in in your browser. Just Google for "download java plug-in  IE", if you're using Internet Explorer. Make sure you download an  offline installation! If you're running a Virtual Machine  VM  that we built in Chapter 1,  Getting Up and Running, drag the executable over to your VM and  run it there, and then restart your browser.  Here's what Admin Applets can do for you. Let's start by looking at Web   Layout Editor.  [ 43 ]   Major Controls  Web Layout Editor Web Layout Editor lets you create the Library hierarchy, define reports, modify  search result pages, and update the Portal Page.  What is the Portal Page? In Content Server it's a page you see when you're about   to log into Content Server  as shown in the following screenshot :  Web Layout Editor lets you customize the Portal Page, add links to it, change  graphics, and so on.  What's the Library hierarchy? It's the Library folders aligned at the left, and also   a page that you access by clicking on the Library link on the portal page:  [ 44 ]   Chapter 2  The Library hierarchy is purely virtual. It's up to the administrator to define folders  and links and build them.  These are some of the most under-used and extremely powerful capabilities in  Content Server. The Library hierarchy can be used to create fully dynamic groups  of related content. Folders can be defined as search queries, so when new content is  added that matches the criteria, it will automatically appear in the corresponding  folders.  And if this is not enough, the library folder pages allow you to customize them with  iDoc Script, Content Server's built-in scripting language. This means you can create  dynamic descriptions, display query results, and build some very cool, very quick  customizations that way.  Now let's take a look at the next applet, User Admin. User Admin This is where you add and remove users, and modify their access. But it's also where  you define your security model.  See Chapter 4, Understanding Security, for detailed  coverage of the Content Server Security Model.   The next applet has several useful features.  [ 45 ]   Major Controls  Repository Manager In fact, Repository Manager does three things for you:   	   	   	  It allows you to query and edit your content. Think of it as an alternative to  a Content Server web interface  in many cases it's more convenient than the  regular interface . You can see all revisions instead of just the latest, filter  your view, add and remove display columns. It's a great tool for browsing  your repository and quick cleansing and matching tasks. It provides a central place to manage content subscriptions  e-mail  notifications of content changes . It lets you configure, start, and stop the indexer  the engine that allows you   to run Content Server searches and queries, and makes them run fast . This  one is probably the most frequently used feature of Repository Manager.  The next applet is critically important. Archiver Archiver is the tool you can use to back up and restore repository content. You  can also do a number of other useful things with Archiver, such as mass deletion   of unused content and global updates of metadata values.  This is also the tool that allows server-to-server content replication  you will be  learning more on Archiver in Chapter 9, Migrating Configuration . Workflow Admin This is probably the only admin applet that doesn't require any explanation. It's  here to define and customize workflows. We have an entire chapter  Chapter 5,  Understanding Workflows  dedicated for workflows and you'll be learning more  about it over there. Configuration Manager I bet you'll be using this last applet most frequently. Any time you need to add  a metadata field, hide an unused one, or add a content type, you'll be starting  Configuration Manager. We'll be spending lots of time with it in the next chapter.  Now let's look at another set of Content Server controls with a similar name but   very different purpose.  [ 46 ]   Admin Server Admin Server is a separate web application that controls Content Server processes.  It also helps you change its global configuration.  Why do you need such an app? Simple! One Admin Server can manage multiple  Content Server instances. You can install additional instances on the same physical  machine or manage instances running on other machines.  Chapter 2  I recommend you put a lot of thought into creating additional Content  Server instances. You don't want to manage too many—especially on the  same physical server  for one thing, they will take a long time to start after  reboot . You'll be facing issues with backup, updates, and administration.  To bring the Admin Server up, click on the Admin Server link under  Administration on the left. It usually comes up in a new window  as shown  in the following screenshot :  [ 47 ]   Major Controls   As you can see, there are buttons to start and stop Content Server. There will be one  set of controls per Content Server instance  as shown in the following screenshot :  Here I've asked Admin Server to also manage another instance called idc Stage. Now here's a little trick that will save you an hour of digging documentation.  Remember I mentioned that Admin Server also lets you change Content Server  settings? How would you get to those pages? The answer is this: The instance name is a button. Click on it! So click on the idc  button now. Voila! the Content Admin Server screen comes up  as shown in the  following screenshot :  You will see a number of administration links on the left. Let's look at the ones you  will be using most often:  [ 48 ]   Chapter 2  General Configuration The name speaks for itself. This is where you can change a few common  configuration options. For instance, you can have Content Server automatically  assign Content ID to new items you check in. To enable this, just put a check next to Automatically assign a content ID on  check in. You can also specify a prefix for the new content ID in the box below.  For example, to have your content ID look like EC00023456, just type EC. The most important part of this page is that Additional Configuration Variables  section in the bottom. Why?  This is simply a text box with the Master Content Server configuration file loaded  there. If there is anything you need to add or update in Content Server configuration,  use this Window and hit Save when you're done. Warning! It's easy to break things when you change configuration this way.  Make backups or just copy entries and comment out the old ones by placing a   hash symbol at the beginning of the line. For instance, to change the main port,   do something like this:  IntradocServerPort=4444 IntradocServerPort=4445  If the new setting doesn't work out then you have an easy way back. The next link reads Content Security. Content Security This section gives you a few additional options to tweak access to content. For  instance, you can allow the author of the content to delete their revisions, even if they  don't have permission to delete content. The options are annotated and descriptions  are pretty clear.  The next link may seem confusing. Internet Configuration This is where the mail server address goes. If you took a shortcut during installation  and are now wondering why you aren't getting any e-mail notifications then this is  where you check.  The next link brings up one of the key customization controls of the Content Server.  [ 49 ]   Major Controls  Component Manager Component Manager is the number one place people go to when using  Content Admin. This is where you install and uninstall, enable and disable   custom components.  In Oracle UCM, the term "custom" is used very loosely. All UCM features such  as Web Content Management, and all hot fixes, are implemented as custom  components. Think of them as UCM extensions. We will learn more about Component Manager in Chapter 11, Web Content  Management and Collaboration. And here's another link used for extending and integrating the Content Server,  View Provider. View Providers View Providers allows you to configure Providers or "Connectors" that are there to  allow Content Server to connect to external systems. We will be using providers to:   	 Connect to the database  the provider named SystemDatabase is    pre-configured for you at install time    	 Set up LDAP or Active Directory authentication  	 Set up Replication—automated scheduled backup and restore for keeping    a number of Content Server instances in sync  The last three links give you access to the key auditing and troubleshooting  information. We will study them in the following section. Server Output, Logs, and System Audit Information Even though these links are available in Admin Server, they are Operations controls,  not Administration. They are here to help you get audit and diagnostic information,  not to change Server configuration. We will look at these in just a few moments. And now let's continue exploring your main Content Server Administration tray.  The next important link we need to look at is Folder Configuration.  Folder Configuration Folder Configuration allows you to control configuration and behavior of Virtual  Folders. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, virtual folders provide users with  a convenient and familiar metaphor for storage and classification. Content Server  folders may be browsed just like other, familiar systems.  [ 50 ]   Chapter 2  Every content item may be associated with a virtual folder. Remember, the content is  not physically stored in that folder. It's just linked to the folder so users can also find  it that way, in addition to using the search feature. The Folder Configuration link is  where you control the global parameters of folder structure hierarchies. It also allows  you to back up, restore, and migrate your folder structures. Click on Folder Configuration in the bottom of the Administration Tray  as shown in  the following screenshot :  One of the most useful features on this screen is the Export and Import Archive  buttons. When you click on Export Archive, your entire folder structure  the folders  you see under Browse Content  Contribution Folders  is exported into a single text  file. You can then use it to re-create the same structure on another server or use it as a  backup.  [ 51 ]   Major Controls   Note that this feature only exports the folders themselves, not the content. If you  need to back up folders and their content, use the Folder Structure Archive Utility. Other controls on this page are there to show and hide system folders, set up  replication, and control folder metadata.  You will learn more about virtual folders  and other options on this page  in   Chapter 6, Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV and Chapter 10, Customizing  Oracle UCM.  And now let's see what's involved in Content Server operations. Here's what you  need to know to keep it up and running.  Keep it up and running Operations are all about keeping things up and running smoothly. If you're facing  a content or functionality issue and need to diagnose it, then this is also the best  place to start.  When things go wrong, the first thing you usually look at is the log files.  Log files For rookies in the crowd: Content Server log file is a list of sequential entries where  it takes a record of all significant activities it engages or is about to engage in.  Almost always, the log file contains more detail on error messages and you can look  at a whole sequence of events; what Content Server was doing just before the error  occurred. Expand the Log Files folder under Administration. Click on Content Server Logs   as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 52 ]   Chapter 2  This screen is also available in Admin Server when you click on  the instance name button  that is idc .  Click on the link that leads to a log file for the data you need to explore. Log file  messages are fairly clear and self-explanatory, but if you need more information, I'll  be helping you get maximum value of Oracle help, documentation, and support in  Chapter 10. You can also zoom in and capture mountains of additional information, not shown  in the log files with System Audit Information.  System Audit Information Follow the link on the left, the second one below Admin Applets. This is where you control what information gets printed on Content Server output.  If you need to see exactly what's going on with a specific sub-system like mail or  indexer then select that in the dropdown and click on Update. The round information icon following Tracing Section Information brings up a  screen with their detailed description. Full verbose tracing, where each tracing section displays an even greater level of  details, may also come handy:  [ 53 ]   Major Controls   Just remember to un-check the box after you are done with diagnostics. Keeping verbose tracing checked affects performance and uses up a lot of  disk space.  Placing a checkmark in the Save box will preserve your choices between Content  Server restarts.  Once tracing sections are configured, the following screen will actually show you   the info you requested. The screen is called View Server Output. View Server Output Click on the View Server Output link on the top left of the screen  as shown in the  following screenshot :  Server output is the most detailed, trace-level logging. If you were to start a Content  Server process from a console window then this is exactly what you would see. As  I mentioned, tracing provides you with the next level of details that you cannot  get from the log files. You can also select what Content Server sections should be  providing you with that level of info. Use the Clear and Refresh buttons above to keep output to a manageable size. The System Audit Information page also has a few vital  indicators like memory   and database connection information  you can also access this screen from   Admin Server . And the next link down under the Administration tray brings up Environment  Packager.  [ 54 ]   Environment Packager Environment Packager is a useful utility, which you use when contacting Oracle  Support. It makes copies of your log files and your system configuration, and places  then into one ZIP file. You can them e-mail it to Oracle Support or attach to your  online inquiry.  I'll be helping you discover the treasure that lies hidden in Oracle  Support later in Chapter 10.  In the next section we will see how to manage users.  Chapter 2  Managing users At last! We're about to see how you can let other people use the system.  It's also a good idea to create a non-admin user account for yourself and only use  sysadmin for administration and operations.  So let's begin by adding a user.  Adding a user Let's add a new user:  1.  Go to Admin Applets and click on User Admin. The User Admin applet   comes up  see screenshot below :  [ 55 ]   Major Controls   2.  Click on the Add button. 3.  Leave user type as Local. Click on OK. 4.  Fill in user info. The first field, Name, is the actual user name the user will   be using to log in  as shown in the following screenshot :  5.  Go to the Roles tab and click on Add Role. Pick Contributor. Click on OK   to close the dialog.  Congratulations! You now have a new user in the system.  What were those User Types all about? In some deployment scenarios you can have one Master Content Server  control a few dependent or Proxied Content Servers. When you have  a Global user on the Master server they will also be able to log into  dependent servers. Local users can only log into the server where they were created. In a  single server deployment Local and Global users behave the same way.  But what if you need to allow everyone from a department to access a certain block  of content? Here's how you'd go about it.  [ 56 ]   Adding a group of users In Content Server a group of users is called an Alias and here's how you create one:  Chapter 2  1.  Go to the Aliases tab on the User Admin Applet. 2.  Click on Add. 3.  Pick a name and description. 4.  Pick users to be added.  You're done  see screenshot below :  What if you already have your users authenticating to an LDAP or Active Directory?  Does it mean they will have to log in again to the Content Server and use yet another  user name and password?  Not necessary. The following section covers these issues in detail.  [ 57 ]   Major Controls   Integrating with external authentication  providers You can integrate Content Server with Windows Active Directory and other LDAP  authentication providers, so the user doesn't need to authenticate again. The user's  group membership within LDAP then determines his her permissions in the  Content Server.  To set up this integration, you will need to understand the Content Server security  model.  I will be covering that in detail in Chapter 4.  The actual integration is  covered in detail in the Managing Security and User Access guide, available from  the Oracle UCM online documentation page.  There is one more useful thing I want you to know about user administration. Let me  show you what's involved.  Customizing the User Admin Applet Sometimes it's convenient to add custom columns to your User Admin Applet such  as Department or Job Title. Not only will these fields make it easier for you and your  sub-administrators to filter for people in a specific department, these values can also  come really handy for workflow escalations and various personalization. It's easy to add and remove custom columns. Just go to the Information Fields tab  on the User Admin Applet.  Remember, those user metadata fields only live in User Admin and custom  workflow applications. They are not content metadata fields.  Here's something else people often ask me about: When you get a fair number of  users you either loose them or get tired of scrolling. If either of these occurs then  either uncheck the Use Filter check box on the Users tab to show ALL the users, or  check it and define the criteria to only show the users you really want to see.  Congratulations! You now understand how to manage users. Next, let me show you  some ways to get content in.  More ways to get content in In the previous chapter we were using a check-in form to bring content in. I  mentioned that there are a few other ways to do it. Let's look at them really quickly.  [ 58 ]   Desktop integration Oracle Desktop integration is an add-on component, available as part of Content  Server Document Management. Once installed, it allows you to simply drag and  drop documents into Content Server folders, just as if those were your local folders  or your shared drive  as shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 2  You can also check out and check in by right-clicking on a document.  If you have MS Office installed, Desktop Integration allows you to check content in  and out from Outlook and other Office Applications.  [ 59 ]   Major Controls   I'll show you how to install Oracle Desktop Integration Suite in Chapter 6.  Another way to bring content in is the use of custom programming.  Custom programming Content Server follows open industry standards. It has a number of Application  Programming Interfaces  APIs . You can connect to it from a Java Component, ASP  page, or using a Web Service.  Let's see how we can use Web Services to integrate the Content Server into our  enterprise. Currently, the most popular communications protocol for Web Services  is Simple Object Access Protocol  SOAP . It uses a common web protocol, HTTP,  to exchange XML-based self-describing messages between a server and a variety of  clients.  To use SOAP Web Services, you'll need a WSDL Generator Component.  If you  download Oracle Universal Content Management Document Management bundle,  you can use Component Manager to install it.   WSDL Generator includes samples on how to automate Content Server operations  virtually from any programming language. Here's how a remote check-in might look:  First, we need to know the URL of our Content Server and user credentials  see  screenshot below :  [ 60 ]   Then we specify metadata values and the file we're about to check in  as shown in  the following screenshot :  Chapter 2  Voila! The file was successfully checked in using a SOAP Web Service!  check out the  following screenshot :  That's it. Were almost done with this section. There's just one more useful tip I want  to give you here. It is related to Content Server configuration.  [ 61 ]   Major Controls   How to auto-generate content IDs Many times, it's a lot easier and more convenient to have Content Server generate  Content IDs for you. They must be globally unique and you may not want to bother  your users with extra error messages. I hope you remember how to enable auto-generation; check the Automatically  assign a content ID on check in box on the General Configuration page in Admin  Server. We covered it earlier in this chapter.  Summary You've just seen all of the Content Server's major controls. You know how to manage  users and where to get detailed error information for troubleshooting.  In the next chapter we will take a detailed look at the metadata. We will learn how to  find information quickly and efficiently, and how to customize your check-in form.  [ 62 ]   Metadata  Welcome back! You're almost done building the foundation of your Content Server  expertise. In fact, you're just two chapters away—this one and the next one, on  security. You will then have a full and clear picture of what Oracle UCM is all about  and how you can get the most value out of it.  We will look at the types of metadata available in the system and how to put them  to good use. You will learn to find information quickly, and how to customize your  Content Server screens without programming. More specifically, you will learn:   	 How to use standard and custom metadata—a major ingredient among   UCM's critical success factors that can spell both "success" and "disaster"   in your organization   	 How to quickly customize Check In, Content Info, and Search screens   without coding, and how to work dependent choice lists  allowing you   to complete even advanced customizations without writing a single line   of code    	 How Content Server stores metadata in the database—a bit of insider  knowledge that will make many of your complex development, data  migration, and code generation tasks a piece of cake  That's right. This will be another easy chapter. Let's begin by looking in   the metadata.   Metadata  Exploring metadata In case you forgot, metadata fields are there to describe the actual data such as the file  name, shooting date, and camera name for a digital picture.  After we installed Content Server in Chapter 2, I mentioned that there're two types   of metadata fields: Standard and Extended or Custom. Let's take a closer look at  what they can do for us.  Standard metadata Standard metadata is essential for the system to function. These are fields like  content ID, revision ID, check-in date, and author. Let's take a quick look at all   of them so you have a full picture.  Lab 2: Exploring standard metadata Click on the Quick Search button on the top right. Yes, leave the search box blank.  If you do that, you'll get all content in the repository. In the last column on the Search Results page click on the i icon on any of the result  rows. That brings up a Content Info screen. From this screen there is no way to tell which fields are Standard and which are  Extended. So how do you tell? Explore the database That's right. A Content Server uses a relational database, like Oracle or SQL Server  to store its metadata, so let's look there. If you followed my instructions in Chapter 2 and used SQL Server 2005 as your  database, then open SQL Server Management Studio, and if not then bring up   your SQL tool of choice.  Check the list of columns in the table called Revisions  as shown in the  following screenshot :  [ 64 ]   Chapter 3  Most of the column names in Revisions are the standard metadata fields.  Here's a list of the fields you will be using most often:   	 dID: ID of the document revision. This number is globally unique. If you   have a project plan with three revisions—each of the three will have unique  dID and all of them will have the same Content ID.   	 dDocName: this is the actual Content ID.  	 dDocType: content type of the document.  [ 65 ]   Metadata  dDocName or Content ID is the unique identifier for a content revision  set. dID is the unique identifier of each individual content revision within  a set. Being able to identify a content revision set is very useful, as it shows and  tracks  makes auditable  the changes of content items over time. Being able to identify each individual revision with dID is also very  useful, so we can work with specific content revisions. This is one of  the great advantages of the Content Server over other systems, which  only store the changes between revisions. Full revision sets as well as  individual revisions are managed objects and each one can be accessed by  its own unique URL.  Now run this SQL statement:  select * from Revisions;  This shows the actual documents in the system and their values for standard  meta fields  as shown in the following screenshot :  And now let's look at the all-important Content Types.  Content Types Content Type is a special kind of meta field. That's all. UCM puts a special emphasis  on it as this is the value that differentiates a project plan from a web page and a team  photo from a vendor invoice.  You may even choose to change the way your check-in and content info form looks  —based on the type of the document.  Let's look how UCM handles Content Types.  [ 66 ]   Lab 3: Exploring content types In Content Server go to Administration  Admin Applets. Launch the Configuration Manager. Select Options  Content Types...  as shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 3  The Content Types dialog opens. As you see, out of the box, Content Server has  seven types—one for each imaginary department. This is a good way of segregating  content. You can also go by the actual type of content. For instance, you can have one  Content Type for Invoice and one for Project Plan.  [ 67 ]   Metadata  They will also have different meta fields. For instance, an Invoice will have a  Contract Number and a Total Amount. A Project Plan will have a project name   and manager's name. Now let me show you how to add content types. How to add a Content Type It's easy to add a new Content Type. Just click on Add..., fill in the type name  and the description. You can also select an icon for the new type.  What if you need to upload a new icon? Just make it into an 8-bit GIF file,   30x37 px, 96 dpi and upload it to:  C:\oracle\ucm\server\weblayout\images\docgifs  If your install path is different or you're not running on Windows then make  appropriate corrections. How to edit or delete a Content Type The only thing to know about editing is that you can not really change the type  name. All you can update is the icon or description.  If you're ready to delete a type then make sure there is no content in the repository  that's using it. Either update it all or delete.  How would you go about doing a mass-update? I'll show you one of the ways in  Chapter 10 on using Archiver.  And now let's proceed to Custom Metadata.  Custom metadata This is what the most of the metadata is. All new fields you will be creating will  also be Custom metadata. Let's take look.  Lab 4: Exploring custom metadata Once again, there is no way you can tell Custom metadata from Standard  metadata—just by looking at the Content Information screen. Just as we did   before—let's look at its database.  [ 68 ]   Custom metadata in the database Go to your favorite database tool and check the list of columns in the table called  DocMeta  as shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 3  The column names in DocMeta are the custom metadata fields.  Notice that Custom or Extended fields have an "x" prefix, not a "d"  prefix, like Standard fields.  Here's a list of the fields you will be using most often:   	 dID: Unique ID of the document revision. Note that this field was also used   in the Revisions table. This is how you can link standard and extended  metadata of one content item. xComments: The Comments text box from your check-in form. xCollectionID: Unique numeric ID or a virtual folder where the item is  residing. If an item is not assigned to any folder, its xCollectionID is zero.   	  	  Now run select * from DocMeta; and see the values for Custom meta fields for  items in your repository.  And here's how to add new fields.  [ 69 ]   Metadata How to add new fields It's easy to add a new metadata fields. Let me walk you though. Let's begin with  a simple text field. Text fields  1.  Bring up Configuration Manager Administrative Applet.  Expand the  Administration Tray and follow the Admin Applets link to bring up a  page with Admin Applets. See Chapter 3 if you need a refresher.   2.  Click on Add. 3.  Give it a name and change field properties as you see fit  as shown in the   following screenshot :  Click on Update Database Design to commit your changes.  How to make sure your recent changes reflect on the  Check In form:  [ 70 ]   Chapter 3  Every time you change meta fields, make sure you publish the  schema by selecting Publish Schema from the Options menu in  Configuration Manager  as shown in the previous screenshot .  And now let me show you how to add option lists. Option lists What if you want to add a drop-down box that displays a list of values to pick from?  Here's how you do it. Let's add a dropdown to our newly created text field:  1.  Bring up Configuration Manager and click on Edit.  [ 71 ]   Metadata  2.  Check the Option List box. Click on Configure to open the Configure   Option List dialog  as shown in the following screenshot :  3.  Click on Edit. 4.  Type in or paste the values. 5.  OK the dialogs. 6.  Publish the schema.  Click on New Check In on the top left. Voila! The Vendor field now has a dropdown  as shown in the following screenshot :  And what if you need user's to pick a contract for a specific vendor? How can you  make a list of contracts refresh every time you pick a new vendor? Let's see this in  the following section.  [ 72 ]   Chapter 3  How to add fields that depend on each other This is a little tricky. Not hard, but it takes a few minutes of preparation. Let me walk  you through it. You'll like the result!  We have a Vendors list. Let's add a list of their contract engagements. Oracle UCM  calls it Dependent Choice Lists. You can make any number of lists depend on each  other. As soon as we get these two connected, you'll see how to add more.  First, we need to create database tables to store the values for both vendors and  contracts. It's actually very simple. Begin with creating the database tables. Creating database tables To create the database tables carry out the following steps:  1.  Bring up Configuration Manager. 2.  Go to the Tables tab and click on Create Table. 3.  Give the table name and description  as shown in the following screenshot :  4.  Add these two columns: Id, int, primary key Name, varchar 100  for replication.  [ 73 ]  5.  Now click on Add Recommended. This adds timestamp fields, needed    Metadata  6.  Click on OK to save the changes.  Create another table for Contracts:  1.  Call it VendorContracts. 2.  Add the following columns:  id, int, Primary key Vendor Id, int  this will be a link to the Vendors table, a foreign key  Description, varchar 100  3.  Click on Add Recommended and then on OK to close the dialog and create   your table  as shown in the following screenshot :  This is another big advantage of the Content Server. Your super-user  Content Server admin is able to safely create tables, views, and database  structures for the content server WITHOUT A DBA! It is safe and easy  for them to do so, and the interface helps to protect users from making  dangerous mistakes.  We're done creating tables! Now you need to link them. How? By creating Views.  [ 74 ]   Creating Views  1.   In Configuration Manager select the Views tab and click on the Add button  to open the Add View dialog  as shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 3  2.  Select the Vendors table and click on Next. 3.  Place checkmarks against id and Name so you can use them for your  metadata values. Then click on Finish to proceed  see the following  screenshot :  [ 75 ]   Metadata  4.  Name it VendorsView and add a description. 5.  Pick id as Internal Column and Name as Visible Column. This way you will   be storing Vendor ID in the database as a metadata value while your users  will see vendor name.  6.  OK the dialog. Your view is now created  as shown in the following   screenshot :  7.  Repeat steps one to four to create another view for the Contracts table.   Call it VendorContractsView. Make sure you make all three columns  visible—id, vendorId, and Description.  Congratulations! Your views are now created. You're almost ready to put your  dependent fields on the form. The last preparation is defining the relationships. Defining relationships This one will only take a few seconds. In Configuration Manager, go to the  Relationships tab and click on Add. Give it a name and pick Parent and Child views and fields  as shown in the  following screenshot :  [ 76 ]   Chapter 3  Now you're ready to create drop-down fields. I'll also show you another neat,   brand-new way of doing it with Content Server 10G R3—tree views.  Populating option lists Wait! What good will these fields do to us if they have no values to display? Let's  put the values in real quick. My personal favorite is the batch edit feature. It allows you to put in hundreds of  values at once, even paste from Excel. Here's how you do it.  In Configuration Manager select the view where you need to add or edit values.  Click on Edit Values… on the bottom right  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 77 ]   Metadata  Click on Edit Batch on the bottom right. A simple text box comes up  as shown in the  following screenshot :  Just type in or paste your values. They need to be separated by a pipe character,   the one above the back slash on most keyboards. It's that simple. If you need to   put Oracle with ID of 1 then simply type:  1Oracle The header row shows you an example. Just paste your value below it and OK  the dialogs. Ready? Now put in the values for VendorContractsView. You can add spaces and tabs  if you like so it's easier to edit  as shown in the following screenshot :  Done! Let's put the fields on the form now. Seriously!  [ 78 ]   Putting the fields on the form We already have a Vendor field. Let's just edit it so it uses the VendorsView:  In Configuration Manager go to Information Fields and select Vendor.  1.  2.  Click on Edit. 3.  Check the Enable Option List box and click on the Configure button next   Chapter 3  to it.  to it.  4.  Select Use View and pick VendorsView. 5.  OK the dialogs to complete the edit.  Now let's add a field for vendor contracts.  1.  In configuration Manager, click on Add. Type Contract for the field name. 2.  Check the Enable Option List box and click on the Configure button next   In the bottom portion of the form check the Dependent field box.  3.  Select Use view and pick VendorContractsView. 4.  5.  Pick xVendor for Depends on field. 6.  Pick Vendors_Contracts for the relationship  as shown in the following   screenshot :  7.  You're done! OK the dialogs to complete.  [ 79 ]   Metadata  Update Database Design. Publish the schema. Bring up your check-in form. Notice  how the options in your Contract field change when you change the selection in the  Vendor box  as shown in the following screenshot :  And here's how to handle multiple selections. Multiple selections Sometimes you need to select more than one value. For instance, you may engage  Oracle on more than one project. So how would you enable that? Really simple! Just edit the Contracts field in Configuration Manager and change  the Option List Type to Multiselect List. That's it! Just publish the schema when  you're done  see the following screenshot :  Every time you make a selection from a contract list, a new value is added to the right.  The red X next to a value allows users to delete it  see the following screenshot :  And I left the best for the last. Check out how you can create tree views.  [ 80 ]   Tree views It's the cool new addition in 10g R3. Instead of two fields for vendors and contracts  you can have only one, and still allow multiple selections:  Chapter 3  How to enable that? Just pick Use Tree on the Configure Option List dialog and click on Edit Definition. All you need to do is pick your first-level view, a relationship, and a second-level  view. That's it! And yes, you can still have Option List Type set to Multiselect List. Perfect! We have defined new metadata fields. Now what?  Well, first of all, you will see them on the Check In screen. Once you check in a new  item you will see your new fields and values on the Content Info screen. And you  can also use your new fields to find your content.  In the following section I'll show you how to find content quickly.  How to find content quickly You already know about the Quick Search box on the top right, and you might've  noticed that you can type both content ID and title. What if you need to run a more  complex query? What if you need to find all invoices for Oracle Consulting dated  after July 1st? Let's use advanced search.  [ 81 ]   Metadata  Advanced search There are two types of advanced search you can perform. The basic is Expanded  Form. Click on Search on the top left of the screen. The Expanded Form comes up   as shown in the following screenshot :  Notice that the Vendor and Contract fields that we added in the previous section  are also included in the form. Values for the Contract field change every time you  change Vendor!  [ 82 ]   Lab 6: Finding content Now change the Search Forms dropdown on the top right to Query Builder Form Click on Show Advanced Options  as shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 3  Notice the query expressions getting built in the text box below. I'm sure you  recognize the internal field names we've seen earlier in this chapter. They were   the field names in the database!  Perform a few searches. See how query expressions get built. You'll be using them  later. Content Server query expressions are very powerful. They are used in many  other places from workflows to web development.  Notice that there are several different ways to search the Content Server. There's   a quick search box on the top right, there's the Expanded Search Form, and there's  the Query Builder. Here are a few tips that will help you get things done faster:   	  If you need to find an item by a part of its content ID or title then use the  Quick Search Box.  [ 83 ]   Metadata   	   	  If you need to search within the item's content  full text search  or you   need to specify values for one or more metadata fields, use the Expanded  Search Form. If you need to type a query expression then use the Query Builder.  Can't see the fields you've just created in the Expanded Form? Make sure you mark  it as Indexed in the Configuration Manager when you create or update it  see the  following screenshot :  And here's how to make your search results look exactly as you want them. Let's  look at how to customize search results.  Customizing search results There're several ways to customize search results. The easiest one is to use  Change View  Customize on the search results screen  as shown in the  following screenshot :  This is great but what about the check-in form? Isn't it critical that users only see the  relevant fields, so they don't feel frustrated and overwhelmed, and end up putting  garbage in the fields?  [ 84 ]   Its sure is critical, so let's see what's involved in customizing the check-in and content  info forms.  Chapter 3  Customizing the check-in and content  info forms I saved the best for the last, didn't I? So how do you only show the fields that you  really want to show? And how do you move them around on the form so they   make the most sense?  There are two ways. Let's see them one by one.  How to hide unused fields all the time Content Server has a tool for controlling how meta fields appear on the check-in  form, content info, search, and so on. It calls Rules. Go to the Rules tab on Configuration Manager, and click on Add to open the Add  New Rule dialog  as shown in the following screenshot :  1.  Mark the rule as Global. 2.  Give it a name. I recommend that you prefix global rules with    "g" or "Global_".  [ 85 ]   Metadata  3.  Flip to the Fields tab. This is where the magic starts happening! 4.  Click on Add. 5.  Let's say, we wanted to hide Trash Delete Date. Pick that in the Field Name   dropdown  as shown in the following screenshot :  You can also move fields around on the form. This is what the  Field Position dropdown is for.  6.  Define what you want the field to look or behave like  see the    following screenshot :  [ 86 ]   Chapter 3  The dialog Add Rule Field gives you a lot of control. Here're a few things you can  do with it:   	 You can simply hide the field by picking Hidden from the Type dropdown   at the top.   	 You can make it required by picking Required from it.  	 You can change the label for the field by specifying a custom label.  	 You can specify a default value that will be pre-populated in the field.  	 You can derive the value from another field.  	 You can restrict the values the user can type in or select.  You can add as many fields to the rule as you like. In the screenshot below I marked  all Trash Delete fields as hidden:  Click on OK and publish your schema. Then bring up a Check In form to see  your changes.  The rule we created is a global one, with no activation conditions. The fields will   be hidden on the search and content info screens.  What if we only want to hide the field on a Check In form, but show on a Content  Info screen? Here's how to show fields based on condition.  [ 87 ]   Metadata  How to show fields based on condition Let me walk you through the steps to set it up:  1.  Edit the rule and check Use rule activation condition  as shown in the   following screenshot :  2.  Click on Edit. 3.   In the Edit Activation Condition dialog click on Add…. Name your  condition something like "Check in Only".  4.  Pick Use action  Check In New  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 88 ]   Chapter 3  OK to close the dialogs. Publish the schema and test your changes.  Did you notice the script that now appears in the Rule Activation  Condition box  as shown in the following screenshot ?  [ 89 ]   Metadata  It's iDoc script, Oracle UCM scripting language. It's a lot like Visual Basic.  We will be seeing more of iDoc when we get to workflows.  And here's how to trigger several rules with one condition.  How to trigger several rules with one condition It's hard to put a lot of fields in one rule. Sometimes it's also useful to trigger a set  of rules at the same time. When you check-in an invoice you want to show general  accounting fields and invoice fields. This is when a Profiles feature comes really handy.  1.  In Configuration Manager go to the Profiles tab. 2.  Click on Select button next to Trigger Field label. 3.  Let's pick Content Type. Your profiles will then get activated based on the  type of content you check in. You can add a brand-new meta field just for  switching profile  as shown in the following screenshot :  4.  Click on Add at the bottom of the dialog to add a new profile. 5.  Let's call it MarketingDocuments. You can then specify the properties  of the profile and add rules to it  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 90 ]   Chapter 3  6.  OK the dialogs and publish your schema.  Once the profile is created in the system, you'll notice that the Search and New  Check In buttons at the top now have dropdowns next to them  as shown in the  following screenshot :  If you try loading the check-in form for Marketing Documents, you will see exactly  the same form as if you picked Standard Check In. Why? Because the only rule that profile now has happens to be a global rule. This means, it's  always on. NO matter WHAT profile you select. If you edit this rule and uncheck the Is Global Rule box  and publish the schema   then your hidden fields will begin to show on a Standard Check In form. But they  will continue to be hidden on the Marketing Documents. The Profile system works!  [ 91 ]   Metadata  Now I'm going to ask you for a little favor. Pause for a second and think of the power  of profiles and rules. See how very complex business logic can be used to control the  display of the check-in, search and the content info forms, and how you can use them  to engineer a smooth, logical, and pleasant user experience.  The purpose of profiles is to display to the user only what he or she needs to see to  correctly contribute and classify their content.  Other systems define rigid metadata lists required for separate libraries or  collections. Oracle UCM has the most flexibility by allowing any metadata field to  be used and re-used in many different scenarios. You don't have to create many  variations of the same field  one for each collection , just to make sure it shows and  displays where you want it.  The designers of the UCM know that users HATE filling out long forms, especially  ones filled with extraneous and empty fields. Profiles and rules are truly the way to  dynamically display relevant information at the time when the user needs it.  And there's more to this story! Let's take a look at the future of metadata.  The future of metadata Metadata may be the single most important feature of Oracle UCM. Imagine  trying to find a scanned copy of a vendor invoice if you had no metadata, no title,  description, date of the invoice, vendor name, or contract number. Imagine going  through thousands of digital images wasting many hours just to find the one you  need. You now have the power to take your project and your organization to the next  level by bringing just the info your business needs—exactly when it's needed. And  you have a complete picture of what tools you can use.  But what if you'd like to tap the brain power of your entire organization and have  your users shape and redefine your metadata over time? I'm sure you've heard of the  Web 2.0 tools such as Tag Clouds and Folksonomies that let you build on and benefit  from the collective intelligence.  Even if this is not the direction you're taking right now, this trend is simply too  important to ignore, and you owe it to yourself to keep current. There are thousands  of online resources and books on this subject. The best introduction that I've been  recommending to my friends for a while is a book by Billy Cripe and others, called  Reshaping Your Business with Web 2.0: Using New Social Technologies to Lead Business  Transformation. If you don't yet consider yourself an ace of Web 2.0 then grab a copy  of this book and see for yourself what you've been missing out on.  This's it for this chapter. All I have left is a brief summary.  [ 92 ]   Chapter 3  Summary You now know where Content Server stores all metadata values, how to add, edit,  and delete fields. You know how to display them on the forms just the way you need  them to show. You also know how to hide the fields you don't want at the moment,  and how to show and rearrange them when you need them back.  And you know how to do all this without writing a single line of code!  In the next chapter we will complete your foundation of Oracle UCM expertise. We  will look at the controversial and confusing subject, Content Server Security. But  don't worry. Over the years, I came up with a special way of explaining security. It  will be easy for you.  [ 93 ]    Understanding Security  A few years ago I was spending days in the meeting room with a couple of very  bright students and two talented developers who were new to Stellent. We were  there for nearly a week trying to make security work for that organization and it  wasn't a pleasant experience!  A lot of people are confused and even scared when it comes to Content Server  security. You might be too. I've seen committees and organizations spending   months at a time trying to understand it.  What's going on?  In March of 2009 I uploaded a video tutorial on YouTube  www.youtube.com  stellentexperts  where I tried a totally different approach at explaining Content  Server security. Hundreds of people have watched it since and I'm proud to tell you  that it made it crystal clear, logical, and easy to understand.  The new approach made all the difference!  Let's use it here to make Content Server security clear and easy for you. Here's what  you will learn in this chapter:   	 A simple trick to quickly understand the Security Model—the surest path to  get it right the first time and avoid costly redesigns! And another damaging  UCM myth shattered, Groups, Roles, and Accounts can be easy to use—if  you, as Administrator, know what you're doing!   	 Understand the components of Content Server security—how they work   together to give you the power and flexibility you need for addressing  today's tough business problems.   	 Things you need to know when planning your security model that will steer  you clear of common pitfalls, and save you from weeks and months of nasty  cleansing and matching.   Understanding Security   	 How to use the Content Server role-based security—the foundation of almost   any other security model and many other important UCM controls such as  workflow and virtual folders.   	 How to use the account-based security component to add the flexibility   you require for addressing the needs of hierarchies, web and shared  environments.  Ready? Let's get into it and let me show you the security model.  Security model made easy First of all, let me mention that by saying Security Model I mean primarily its  authorization component. It's the one that defines what users can do and what  content they can access. There's also the authentication piece that determines who  the user really is, and there's auditing, that keeps track of what people do. We've  seen the use of the Content Server log files and the use of providers to connect the  Content Server to LDAP for authentication in Chapter 2, Major Controls, so let's focus  on authorization.  We will start by placing "red flags" around common confusion points.  Why does it seems confusing Most of us are used to Windows and UNIX security systems, user groups, file and  folder permissions, and so on. We're comfortable with these and are expecting Oracle  UCM to work the same way. But it doesn't! What you need is a paradigm shift.  A paradigm shift We've seen that Content Server is like a database, not like a directory structure.  There is no hierarchy, so you cannot just go to a folder and say that John can access  this folder but Mary cannot. We can't even say that the folders and content items  would inherit permissions from their parent.  If all you have is one big database table then you have to assign permissions at   the row level; that is, at the level of individual content items.  And if you have a million records, you're not going to assign permissions to each  individual record. So how does Stellent do it?  It groups together records with similar security.  [ 96 ]   Chapter 4  For example, if you have records belonging to different departments then you can  group them by department. On a website you can group them by section of the site.  Now here's a second reason for people being confused about the UCM security  model. It's the use of multiple dimensions.  Multiple dimensions If you follow documentation you'll be learning many ways to control content item  security one after another. Soon enough, you'll be hopelessly confused.  It's like a backhoe hat has five different sets of handles for moving it left to right,  up or down, one for grabbing and releasing the soil, one for moving its base up and  down. And yes there's another pair for moving the platform!   So new operator's first month on the job will be nothing except for swearing   and the noise of an erratically moving mechanic shovel, crashing into trees and  closely parked cars!  OK, OK. There's a better way to learn them. Let's look at the main components   of UCM security.  [ 97 ]   Understanding Security  Components of UCM security There are two components, that get used most of the time—the role-based and  account-based authorization. If you install additional components such as Web  Content Management, Collaboration Manager, or Records Management, you will  end up with additional locks. So how do you manage all of them without getting  confused?  Here's the way I found to work really well. Once you understand it, you will never  be confused again.  Imagine the door in your house or apartment with several locks on it. Let's say, it   has three locks. If you open one lock, lock number 1, but locks number 2 and 3 are  still engaged, the door is still locked.  Let's say, the role-based authorization is your lock number one, and account-based  authorization is the lock number two. If John's role gives him access to a content  item, but his account prevents it then lock 1 will be open and lock 2 closed. It's  that easy.  Never again will you have to consider interactions between components of the UCM  security model. There is none! Just check your locks one by one. If all of them are  open then John has access.  Now it's time to look at individual components. Shall we? Let's start with the  role-based component.  [ 98 ]   Understanding the role-based component Earlier in this chapter I mentioned that setting permissions on each individual  content item is not practical and that UCM groups together content with the same  security. How does it do that?  Chapter 4  Security groups A Security Group is a group of content items that have the same level of security. There is a standard metadata field called Security Group, dSecurityGroup. In a sample organization that has accounting, sales, and manufacturing—you may  split content into three security groups, one for accounting, one for sales, and one   for manufacturing. Content in sales will have dSecurityGroup=sales. Out of the box, there're two security groups—Public and Secure  as shown in the  following screenshot . You can create additional security groups as you see fit; I'll  show you how to do this later in this chapter.  So now that you've seen how the content is grouped together by security, let's see  how user access is controlled. Let's start by examining user roles.  User roles What are the Roles? In short, access to groups of content is controlled through the  user role membership. What do I mean by role membership?  Let's say, we have a local accounting manager who has full control over documents  in accounting, and clerks, who can only modify and create content but not delete.  Let's also assume that the manager can go to user administration to add new people  in accounting and give them permissions.  [ 99 ]   Understanding Security  Let's complete this picture by adding auditors who can read content in accounting  but not create, modify, or delete. They shouldn't grant permissions either.  When a manager adds a new clerk to accounting, wouldn't it be easier just to say  that "Debbie is an Accounting Clerk" rather than specify that she has read and write  access to accounting documents?  Also if Peter is an internal auditor and he also needs access to documents in  Manufacturing, all you need to do is to add him to another role. Now Peter has   read access to both Accounting and Manufacturing and is set to perform his auditing  task.  That's great, but how are we going to do this? How are we going to specify that the  Manager Role has full access and Auditor is read only? The answer to this question is Permissions.  Permissions Permissions define what user roles can do on content groups. This is the easiest  piece of the entire role-based security system. Check out the following screenshot:  [ 100 ]   Chapter 4  Just check the boxes against permissions that you want to assign to your role.   Admin permission lets you give access to this security group to other users.  This is how sub-administrators get created. And now that the picture is complete, let's see role-based security in action.  Lab 9: Working with content groups and   user roles  1.  Bring up User Admin. 2.  Click on Security  Permissions by Group…  as shown in the   following screenshot :  [ 101 ]   Understanding Security  3.  The Permissions by Group dialog comes up. Select Public  as shown in the   following screenshot :  4.  Notice that the list of user roles is displayed on the right, with their  corresponding permissions specified in brackets. For example, the  contributor role has read and write access to the Public security group.  5.  Click on Add Group… button at the bottom of the dialog. 6.  Add a group called accounting  as shown in the following screenshot :  7.  Add another group called manufacturing. 8.  Close the dialogs to return to User Admin. 9.  Now select Security  Permissions by Role. 10.  Click on the Add New Role button and add a role called   Accounting Manager.  [ 102 ]   11.  Select it and select accounting security group  as shown in the   following screenshot :  Chapter 4  12.  Click on the Edit Permissions… button on the right. Click on Admin.   Notice that other lower-level permissions also get checked.  13.  Add Accounting Clerk and Auditor roles. 14.  Give Auditor read access to both accounting and manufacturing security   groups  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 103 ]   Understanding Security  Note that Accounting Manager and Accounting Clerk can only access documents  in accounting.  Understanding the accounts component Let's say, you only want accounting clerks to work with the current year's data and  have read-only access to historic content. If you try to do this with role-based security  the picture will get really ugly.  Now if you split your accounting into payable and receivable, it will get even  messier. What are we going to do about it?  Role-based security that we just looked at is lock number one on the door. Sometimes  you'd want a more detailed control than it can give you. We need more locks on that  door!  If Debbie is in Accounts Receivable and tries to access any content in Accounting  then our lock 1, the role-based security, will be open. But we need lock 2 to be  closed when she accidentally tries to modify a historic record or a document in  Accounts Payable.  Let's see how adding lock 2 helps us solve this problem.  How accounts are different Accounts, our lock 2, are completely different from our lock 1—role-based  security. As we've just seen, the role-based component can really use some help  when it comes to supporting hierarchies and this is exactly where accounts excel.  I've seen how the actual use of the word "Account" can be very confusing.  When they say "account", most people think of the User Account, the  record in the system that gives them access. I found that when you call  Accounts in Content Server "Content Accounts" at least, for a month or  two, it may prove really clear things up.  How accounts support hierarchies Content Account is another standard metadata field, dDocAccount. It's also there to  group together content with similar security. But here's the big difference: Unlike dSecurityGroup, dDocAccount support hierarchies based on a prefix rule.  For example, if you have access to ca on then you'll also have access to:  [ 104 ]   Chapter 4   	 ca on montreal  	 ca on toronto  	 ca on ottawa and also  	 ca ontario_business, please note that slashes are optional!  Slashes make values in dDocAccount easier to read, but you can use any other  character to separate levels of access.  Now you know how to solve the problem I mentioned earlier in this section.   Let's define the following Content Accounts for our sample company:   	 accounting payable current—current active documents in Accounts   Payable. Clerks will have read and write access here.   	 accounting payable past—past, archived documents in Payable. Only   a manager will be able to modify them but the clerks are Read Only.   	 accounting receivable current—current active documents in Accounts    	 accounting receivable past—past documents in Receivable that only a   Receivable.  manager can modify.  And here's how we are going to specify access:   	 A head of accounting will have access to accounting.  	 A manager of Accounts Payable will have access to accounting payable.  	 A clerk in Receivable will only have full access to accounting receivable   current.  Before we go on, let me give you a word of caution: The maximum length of dDocAccount is limited to 35 characters. Now let's see how to differentiate read-only from full access to a content account.  How permissions are specified This the easy part. User's permissions to access specific content accounts are specified  directly on the Edit User screen. If John is the head of Accounts Payable, he will have  accounting payable in the list of Content Accounts he can access.  Let's put it all together:  [ 105 ]   Understanding Security  Lab 10: Working with content accounts First, we need to make sure that Content Accounts are enabled on the system.  By default, Accounts are disabled. To find out see if the Accounts tab is  present when you edit a user in User Admin. If the tab is not there then  you'll need to enable accounts before you can use them. The following screenshot shows the Edit User dialog when Accounts are  enabled and the Accounts tab is present:  How to enable accounts Here's how to do it:  1.  Bring up Admin Server.  See Chapter 2 if you need a refresher.  2.  Click on the Content Server instance where you need to enable accounts. 3.  Go to General Configuration  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 106 ]   Chapter 4  4.  Scroll to the Additional Configuration Variables text box at the bottom   of the page.  5.  Append the following at the end: UseAccounts=Yes. 6.  Restart Content Server.  Accounts are now enabled. You'll need to close and re-open the User Admin  application to see the changes.  And there's one more step that you need to do if you need a list of values to show in  a dropdown next to the account field. In the following section we'll see how to create  pre-defined accounts.  [ 107 ]   Understanding Security How to create pre-defined accounts Let's go ahead and create the four content accounts we looked at earlier in  this section:  1.   In User Admin go to Security  Predefined Accounts…  as shown in the  following screenshot .  2.  Click on the Add button. 3.  Add the following accounts: accounting payable current, accounting   payable past, accounting receivable current, and accounting receivable  past  as shown in the following screenshot .  OK. We now have the accounts defined, but we're not done yet. The next section  shows you how to give users access to content accounts.  [ 108 ]   How to give users access to content accounts Here's how to put it all together, it's actually very simple:  1.  Create a new user, just like you did in Chapter 2. Switch to the Accounts tab   as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 4  Did you notice the two special accounts—the [documents without  accounts] and the [all accounts]? They give you a chance to grant your  admin users access to all content regardless of its account, and to control  access to content where no account value is specified. When creating users with iDoc Script these will become none and all  correspondingly. And when you need to select all content items that have no value set in  the account field, use the following query: dDocAccount   ''  [ 109 ]   Understanding Security  2.  Click on Add. The Add New Account dialog displays. You can now   pick from a list of pre-defined accounts or type it in  as shown in   the following screenshot :  3.  Uncheck Write to reduce Peter's access to read-only.  All done! Now bring up your check-in form  as shown in the following screenshot .  Notice how your newly created Security Groups and Content Accounts are  displayed in the drop-down boxes.  And here are a few important last minute comments on planning your security model.  [ 110 ]   Chapter 4  Planning your security model A security model, just like a metadata model, has long-ranging implications. It's  much easier to spend a few more days planning when you still have no content   in the system than trying to migrate your content into a new model later.  This said, it's still better to go ahead with your best guess than get stuck in a  planning stage forever! And yes, you can change your security model at any time— I'll show you how to mass-update your content in Chapter 9, Migrating Configuration.  The best way to get started is by reviewing the things that affect security.  Things that affect security When using multiple security components together such as role-based, account-based,  Web Content Management, and others you may decide to place more emphasis on one  of the "locks" and keep others relatively open. For instance, when you rely on accounts  to control your access to content hierarchies, you may decide to place most of your  content into the Public security group.  Also, when planning a security model, you might find it easier to start with broad  strokes, such as defining your content categories, the degree of control you require  over them, and your use case model.  We will look at these in a bit more detail in the following sections.  Content categories Content categories are main "buckets" of content that you want to keep separately,  like departments in your company or sub-sites in a large website.  You may consider using security groups to split content into these but you can also  keep your lock 1 wide open and use accounts to control them.  The next aspect to look at is the degree of control.  Degree of control These are additional degrees of control you might need over your broad content  categories. For example, you may need to implement hierarchies and folder  structures with different levels of access or you may need to separate public, private,  and top secret content.  [ 111 ]   Understanding Security Your use cases In many cases, a good use case model can be very helpful when it comes to security.  For once, it identifies the types of users you have. You'll immediately see what your  Head of Accounting needs to do, what the Manager of Receivable can, and how his  system interactions are different from those of an Auditor.  Other UCM products you might be using This book focuses on Oracle Content Server and Web Content Management. If  you use or are planning to use other products such as Collaboration Manager or  Universal Records Management, these products will affect your security. Why?  Each of them adds another "lock on the door" to your security model. You then   have an option of keeping these new locks wide open and using the role-based   and account-based security or adding the new locks to the mix.  Just remember to keep the locks separate. Each of them has its own use.  Summary In this chapter you learned how to use Oracle UCM Security. You've learned why so  many people get confused by it, and a simple and effective strategy to keep things  clear.  You now know its major components, Role-based and Account-based security, and  how they complement each other to help you meet your needs.  In the next chapter you'll learn about Content Server workflows, and how to harness  their powers to automate approval processes.  [ 112 ]   Understanding Workflows  Welcome! In the previous chapter we finished laying the foundation of our   Oracle Content Server expertise. Now let's build on it, to give you the tools   you'll need in daily operations and administration. This chapter will fill you   in on Content Server workflows.  Workflows are one of the most used and useful features of UCM. They give you the  power to quickly set up reviews and approvals for documents, web pages, product  documentation, "stage gates" for project management artifacts, "virtual voting" on  government legislation, gathering digital signatures, and SOX compliance reviews.  This chapter covers things you'd be doing most of the time as well as other important  things you ought to know about workflows. More specifically you will learn:   	 How to set up and change Content Server workflows—allowing you to get   up to speed really fast, walking you step by step through an automation of   a real-world approval process.   	 Hidden  and frequently overlooked  facts about content life cycle that will   help you locate and reclaim your disappeared content items.   	 Tools you need for advanced workflow design such as workflow templates,  jumps, sub-workflows, and scripting—that let you harness the true power   of Content Server workflows.   	 How to group approvers and even select them dynamically based on the   business rules—maybe the last bit of advice you will need to automate that  complex business process you were looking at.   	 Different types of workflows you have to choose from and how to pick the   best one for your task at hand.   Understanding Workflows  How to set up and change workflows First thing's first. Let's start by looking at the tools that you will be using to set up  and configure your workflows.  Discover the Workflow Admin application Go to Administration  Admin Applets and launch Workflow Admin. The  Workflow Admin application comes up  as shown in the following screenshot :  There are three tabs:   	 Workflows: This tab is used for administering Basic or Manual Workflows.   We will be covering them later in this chapter.   	 Criteria: This tab deals with Automatic or Criteria Workflows—the type we   will be using most often.   	 Templates: This is the place where you can pre-assemble Workflow   Templates—reusable pieces that you can use to create new basic workflows.  Let's create a simple automatic workflow. I call it automatic because content enters the  workflow automatically when it is modified or created.  [ 114 ]   Chapter 5  If you will be using e-mail notifications then be sure to  check your Internet Configuration screen in Admin Server.  See Chapter 2, Major Controls, if you need a refresher on how  to launch the Admin Server interface.  I'll walk you through the steps in using automatic workflows.  Lab 7: Using automatic workflows Here's the process for creating a criteria workflow: Creating a criteria workflow Follow these steps:  1.  Go to the Criteria tab and click on Add. The New Criteria Workflow dialog   comes up  as shown in the following screenshot :  2.  Fill in Workflow Name and Description. 3.  Pick the Security Group. Only items with the same security group as the   workflow can enter it. Let's use the security group we've created in the  previous chapter. Select accounting.  4.  We're creating a Criteria Workflow, so let's check the Has Criteria   Definition box.  [ 115 ]   Understanding Workflows  5.  Now you can specify criteria that content must match to enter the workflow.   For the sake of this lab, let's pick Account for the Field, and accounting  payable current for the Value.  Please note that a content item must match at least two conditions to enter the  workflow: it must belong to the same security group as the workflow, and it must  match the criteria of the workflow.  As soon as a new content item is created with Security Group of accounting  and Content Account value is set to accounting payable current, it will enter  our workflow.   It will not enter the workflow if its metadata is simply updated to  these values. It takes a new check-in for an item to enter a criteria  workflow. If you need it to enter a workflow after a metadata update  then consider custom components available from the Fishbowl  Solutions  www.fishbowlsolutions.com .  You can use any metadata field and value pair as criteria for entering the workflow.  But you can only have one condition. What if that's not enough?  If you need to perform additional checks before you can accept the item in a  workflow then keep your criteria really open, and do your checks in the workflow  itself. I'll show you how, later in this chapter.  The diagram next illustrates how a content item flows through a criteria workflow.  You may find it useful to refer back to it as you follow the steps in this lab.  [ 116 ]   Chapter 5  OK. We have a workflow created but there're two problems with it: it has no steps in  it and it is disabled. Let's begin by seeing how to add workflow steps.  [ 117 ]   Understanding Workflows Adding workflow steps Here's how you add workflow steps:  1.  Click on the Add button in the Steps section on the right  as shown in the   following screenshot :  2.  The Add New Step dialog opens. Fill in the step name and description    as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 118 ]   3.  Click on the Add User button on the right and select approvers for this step.   Also add yourself to the list of approvers so you can test the workflow.  4.  Switch to the Exit Conditions tab  as shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 5  5.  You can change the number of approvers required to move the item to the   next step. You can make all approvers required to advance a step or just any  one as shown on the screenshot.  6.  And if you put zero in the text box, no approvers will be required at all. They   will still receive notification, but the item will go immediately to the next  step. And when the current step is the last the workflow will end and the  new revision will be released into the system. What do I mean by that? Until  workflow is complete, revisions that are currently in a workflow will not  come up in searchers and will not show on the Web. You will still see them in  the content info screen but that's it.  7.  OK the dialog. You now have a workflow with one step. Let's test it.  But first, you need to enable the workflow.  [ 119 ]   Understanding Workflows Enable the workflow This is the easiest step of all:  1.  Click on the Enable button on the bottom right. Say Yes on a confirmation   dialog. The workflow is now enabled.  2.  Bring up your Check In form and check in a small document with Security   Group set to accounting and Account of accounting payable current  as  shown in the following screenshot :  [ 120 ]   The Check in Confirmation dialog is displayed as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 5  1.  Click on the Content Info link. 2.  Notice how the Workflow field shows the name of the workflow and the   item's status is set to Review  as shown in the following screenshot :  3.   If e-mail notifications are configured, your approver will receive an e-mail,  inviting them to review an item  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 121 ]   Understanding Workflows  4.  Click on the Quick Search button on the top right. Notice that your item   does not show in the search results!  5.  Expand the Content Management tray on the left and click on the Active  Workflows link. The All Active Workflows screen displays as shown in  the following screenshot:  6.  Click on Manager_Approval. Content items in the workflow will be   displayed  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 122 ]   7.  You can now approve content by clicking on the Workflow Actions icon. A  link under the item's content ID brings up the content item itself so you can  preview the changes.  8.  Select Workflow Review; it's the first item on the list. The Workflow Review   screen comes up  as shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 5  The right pane shows a web-viewable version of the file when available. The  Workflow Review screen is another way to approve or reject an item in a workflow. When rejected, content goes back to the previous step in a workflow. In our case, it  will go back to the Contribution step, which is the stage of its original check in. You  can then make the changes and check in to re-submit the item for approval. Or you  can delete its current revision to cancel the change.  This is it! You're now all set to set up and use a simple workflow. Why don't you add  another step to our test Manager_Approval workflow and check in another item?  [ 123 ]   Understanding Workflows  You will need to disable the workflow before you can make  any changes. When you disable a workflow all content items that were  going through it will be released. Be sure that you are  OK with that consequence before making a changes to a  workflow, which might be handling live content.   	 Try approving an item on the first step and rejecting it on the next one.   Watch it coming back to the first step.   	 Observe how e-mail notifications change, reflecting the current step the   item is in. Click on the link in e-mail notifications. See how it brings you   to the Workflow Review screen.   	 Get the item fully approved. Do a quick search. Watch the item being   indexed and added to the search results.  And here's yet another way your approvers can access their pending items. Check  out the My Workflow Assignments page  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 124 ]   Congratulations! I hope you're getting a feel of what a simple workflow can do. Now  let's get something quick but important out of the way.  Chapter 5  Understanding the content life cycle Is there a quick way to tell what's going on with a content item? Do you have to  search all over the system to see where it might be? Nope. It's much easier than this. All you need to do is bring up a Content Info  screen. Have you noticed a Status field towards the bottom? This is the field that  shows you exactly what's happening with the item  see the following screenshot :  Here're a few common states an item goes through and corresponding values you'll  see in the Status field:   	 Review: The item is in the workflow.  	 Edit: The item is in the contribution stage. It has probably been rejected   from the first step of the workflow.   	 Pending: The item was included in a basic workflow along with the other   items. It was approved and is waiting while the rest of the items go through  the workflow.   	 Done: Workflow is complete.  	 GenWWW: Conversion is in progress. For instance, when you use the PDF   converter to generate a PDF version after check in.   	 Released: All done. The item is available and will appear in searches. And now let's see another important use of the Status field in the next section.  [ 125 ]   Understanding Workflows Indexer glitches Sometimes it might seem that a content item has disappeared on you! You know   it was fully approved or there might even be no workflow configured for it. Yet   the link to that item doesn't work or the content doesn't display on a web page.   What happened?  The item may not be indexed yet. When you check in large number of documents,  it may take a while for all that new content to get indexed and being showing up in  searches. Or it may "get stuck" in an indexing stage and need to be reindexed. The good news is that you can easily view all of that "hidden" content on the Work  In Progress page.  Expand the Content Management tray to get to it, as shown in  the following screenshot.  If content is there, you can use this page to resubmit it to  the indexer:  While one or two odd glitches may not be concerning, if you start getting those   often then it may be the time to rebuild your search index. How? Use the Indexer tab of the Repository Manager Applet. Be sure to check  documentation before rebuilding a large index or doing it on a live production  system, otherwise you may cause some downtime.  Wow! We're learning some advanced stuff here and this is just the beginning.   Let's explore some more.  More things you can do with Content  Server workflows Now that you've built your first workflow, let's dig a little deeper and see what else  can you do with Content Server workflows. I'll show you how to add groups of users  as approvers, how to create jumps, use scripting, and perform other really powerful  things. Let's begin by looking at the top three things.  [ 126 ]   Chapter 5  The top three things As we've just seen, the most common things you can do are these:  1.  Get content approved: This is the most obvious use of the workflow we've   just seen.  2.  Get people notified: Remember when we were adding workflow steps there  was a number of required approvers on the Exit Conditions tab in the Add  New Step dialog. If we set that to zero we accomplish one important thing:  Approvers will get notified, but no action is required of them. It's a great way  to "subscribe" a select group of people to an event of your choice.  3.  Perform custom actions: And if that's not enough you can easily add  custom scripts to any step of a workflow. You can change metadata,   release items, and send them to other workflows. You can even invoke   your custom Java code.  And here's another really powerful thing you can do with custom workflow actions.  You can integrate with other systems and move from the local workflow to process  orchestration. You can use a Content Server workflow to trigger external processes. UCM 10gR3 has an Oracle BPEL integration built in. This means that a UCM  workflow can be initiated by  or can itself initiate  a BPEL workflow that spans many  systems, not just the UCM. This makes ERP systems such as Siebel, PeopleSoft, SAP,  and Oracle e-Business Suite easily accessible to the UCM, and content inside the  UCM can be easily made available to these systems.  So let's look at the jumps and scripting.  Jumps and scripting Here's how to add scripting to a workflow:  1.   In Workflow Admin select a step of a workflow we've just created.  Click on the Edit button on the right.  [ 127 ]   Understanding Workflows  2.  The Edit Step dialog comes up. Go to the Events tab  as shown in the   following screenshot :  There are three events that you can add custom handlers for:   	 Entry: This event triggers when an item arrives at the step.  	 Update: This happens when an item or its metadata is updated. It's also   initiated every hour by a timer event, Workflow Update Cycle. Use it for  sending reminders to approvers or escalating the item to an alternative  person after your approval period has expired.  [ 128 ]    	 Exit: This event is triggered when an item has been approved and is about  to exit the step. If you have defined Additional Exit Conditions on the Exit  Conditions tab then those will be satisfied before this event fires.  The following diagram illustrates the sequence of states and corresponding events  that are fired when a content item arrives at a workflow step:  Chapter 5  Great! But how do we can actually add the jumps and custom scripts to a  workflow step?  How to add a jump to a workflow step Let's add an exception where content submitted by sysadmin will bypass our  Manager Approval workflow. We will use a jump—a construct that causes an item  to skip the normal workflow sequence and follow an alternative path. Here's how to  do it:  1.  Add a jump to an Entry event of our very first step. On the Events tab of the   Edit Step dialog, click on the Edit button—the one next to the Entry event.  [ 129 ]   Understanding Workflows  2.  The Edit Script dialog displays  as shown in the following screenshot :  3.  Click on the Add button. The Add Jump dialog comes up  as shown in   the following screenshot :  [ 130 ]   Chapter 5  4.  Let's call the jump Sysadmin WF bypass. You don't need to change anything   else at this point. Click on OK to get back to the Edit Script dialog. In the Field drop-down box pick Author.  5.  6.  Click on the Select… button next to the Value box. Pick sysadmin  if you   have trouble locating sysadmin in the list of users, make sure that the filter  check-box is un-checked .  7.  Click the Add button below the Value field. Make sure that your clause   8.   9.   appears in the Script Clauses box below. In the Target Step dropdown pick Next Step. Once you have done so the  value will change to its script equivalent, @wfCurrentStep 1 . If you have more than one step in the workflow, change 1 to the number of  steps you have. This will make sure that you jump past the last step and exit  the workflow. Here's how the completed dialog will look  as shown in the  following screenshot :  [ 131 ]   Understanding Workflows  10.  Click on OK to close. You're now back to the Events tab on the Edit Step   dialog. Notice a few lines of script being added to the box next to the Entry  event  as shown in the following screenshot :  11.  OK the dialog. It's time to test your changes.  [ 132 ]   12.  Check in a new document. Make sure you set the Author field to sysadmin.  Set your Security Group to accounting, and Account to accounting payable  current. If you don't, the item will not enter our workflow in the first place   as shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 5  13.  Complete your check-in and follow the link to go to the Content Info page.  See the status of the item. It should be set to Released. That's right. The item  got right out of the workflow.  Check in a new document again, but use some other author. Notice how your item  will enter the workflow and stay there. As you've seen, the dialog we used for  creating a jump is simply a code generator. It created a few lines of script we needed  to add the handler for the Entry event. Click on the Edit button next to that code and pick Edit Current to study it. You can  find all the script function definitions in iDoc Reference Guide.  Perfect! And we're still not done.  What if you have a few common steps that you'd like to reuse in a bunch of  workflows? Would you just have to manually recreate them? Nope. There are several  solutions that allow you to reuse parts of the workflow. The one I find to be most  useful is sub workflows.  [ 133 ]   Understanding Workflows  Sub workflows Sub workflows are reusable blocks of steps that you can then jump into from a  number of other workflows. It's easy to create a sub workflow, just keep the Has  Criteria Definition box un-checked when you create a regular criteria workflow   as shown in the following screenshot :  This is it…  And if this is not enough, let's look at the workflows that can hold multiple items   at once. Let's look at the Manual or Basic workflows.  Basic workflows The reason they're called "Basic" or "Manual" is because this type of a workflow  doesn't trigger automatically. It has to be started by hand, by an administrator,   or a power user.  The User's role must have a right to run the Workflow Admin application.  Go to Security  Permissions By Role  Edit Applet Rights in the User  Admin applet to make sure.  Basic Workflows have a big advantage, they can hold more than one content item  and get them approved together. You can even create new item placeholders and   get them elaborated as part of the workflow.  [ 134 ]   How do you create a Basic Workflow? Let me show you in the following section.  Chapter 5  Lab 8: Using manual workflows Follow these steps:  1.  Bring up Workflow Admin and go to the Workflows tab  as shown in the   following screenshot :  2.  Click on the Add… button and create new workflow. 3.  Select content items that you're going to run through the approval process. 4.  Select one or more contributors. The first step of a basic workflow is always a  contribution step. Contributors will be invited to check-out and check back in  the items in the workflow.  5.  Create one or more approval steps just as we did in Lab 7.  [ 135 ]   Understanding Workflows  6.  Your basic workflow is now ready to start  as shown in the    following screenshot :  7.  Start it by clicking on the Start button at the bottom right. 8.  Log in as one of the contributors and go to My Workflow Assignments.   Use the Actions column on your right to complete your workflow assignment.  Congratulations! You've just created and tested a basic workflow.  But what if you have to send additional items through a very similar basic  workflow? Do you have to keep on recreating workflow steps every time?   Of course not! Use Templates. Here's how to create templates.  [ 136 ]   Basic workflow templates In Workflow Admin switch to the Templates tab. Give the new template a name and  description. Now you can add and configure workflow steps just as you would in a  "normal" basic workflow  as shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 5  Once you have the template defined, you can use it for creating new basic  workflows. Just check the Use Template checkbox on the Add New Workflow  dialog.  Can you put yourself in the picture? See how much time the templates would   save you?  And here's an even bigger time saver. Let me show you how to group approvers.  How to group approvers I bet you've asked this question a few times while reading this chapter. How would  you add a group of users as contributors or approvers? You've also seen Add Alias  and Add Token buttons. So here's how to use aliases to group approvers.  [ 137 ]   Understanding Workflows Using aliases to group approvers As you remember from the previous chapter, an Alias is group of users. It's easy to  create aliases with the User Admin applet. This is it! Now you can use Add Alias  button on workflow steps and workflow template dialogs to add a group of users.  Everyone in the group will receive notifications. And if just one approver is required  to complete a workflow step any user in that alias can do it.  If you think that was useful then check out the next section. I'll show you how to  select workflow approvers dynamically, using script. So here's how to use tokens   to pick approvers dynamically.  Using tokens to pick approvers dynamically What if you host a number of websites for your clients, and you need your website  owners to approve their content? I know you can create one workflow per site. But   is there a way to just use one workflow? What if you allow your users to dynamically  create their own sites and one workflow per site is just not the choice you want   to make?  Here's how you can do it:  1.  We're going to create groups of approvers for each site using aliases.    This is pretty obvious but the next step holds the real key:  2.  We're going to define a token that will let our workflow select the right alias   for each content item.  Let's define our aliases first.  Here's a little trick we're going to use. Let's assume that we have a meta field called  xWebsites that holds the name of the website, that a content item belongs to.  We'll be looking at the Web Content Management in Chapter 11,  Web Content Management and Collaboration. If you don't have the  Site Studio component installed in your Content Server, you will  most likely not have a field called xWebsites defined yet. Just  go ahead and create it yourself, so you can follow the steps next.  [ 138 ]   We're going to use the actual values of this field as the names of the aliases.  1.  Bring up the User Admin applet. Go to the Aliases tab and click on the   New button below.  2.  Let's create an alias  group of users  called marketing_intranet  as shown   in the following screenshot :  Chapter 5  3.  Go ahead and create aliases to other websites such as marketing_extranet   and corporate_www.  Perfect. We're done creating aliases. Now it's the time to leverage the power  of tokens:  1.  Bring up Workflow Admin. Select Options  Tokens from the menu. 2.  The Workflow Tokens dialog comes up. Click on the Add button at   the bottom.  [ 139 ]   Understanding Workflows  3.  The Add Token dialog opens. Let's call it Web_Sites  as shown in the   following screenshot :  4.  Click on the Add button. The Add Token User dialog comes up  as shown   in the following screenshot .  5.  Pick Alias for the Type and xWebsites for the Name.  6.  OK the dialogs to save changes.  We're all done! You can now add your newly created token to workflows. How does  it work?  [ 140 ]   Chapter 5  Actually it is simple. If we check in a content item with xWebsites set to marketing_ intranet, the token will get evaluated to marketing_intranet. Now the token was  created for an alias so it will resolve to an alias of marketing_intranet. This is it.  Now we have a dynamic way to pick a group of approvers based on the metadata  values. Nice!  And we're done with another chapter! Just one more tip before you flip the page. I've  shown you almost every tool and technique you will ever need while using Content  Server workflows, but you may still find it helpful to review the detailed Workflow  Implementation Guide, that you can find on the UCM documentation page.  Summary Phew! It was a long chapter. But once again, we've learned almost all there is to  know about the Content Server workflows.  You now know how to create a workflow. You've seen the different types of  workflows and you've created one of each. You've seen how to use scripting to  customize them, how to create reusable pieces, and how to group approvers.  The next chapter will be an easy one. We will look at virtual folders and I'll show   you how to use Windows Explorer and MS Office applications to contribute content.  [ 141 ]    Understanding Virtual   Folders and WebDAV  In the previous chapter we picked up almost all there is to know about Content  Server Workflows. I hope I got you excited about how simple and powerful they are.  In this chapter I'll explain how to build and administer hierarchical folder structures.  Here's what you'll learn in this chapter:   	 What virtual folders really are  	 How content items are linked to a folder  	 Major controls you use in Content Server User Interface when you're   working with folders   	 How to use folders to manage metadata  	 How to set up and use Windows Desktop Integration Suite  Wow! Isn't that a lot of material to learn in 30 minutes? I thought so too when I  first had to use Virtual Folders a few years ago. But what made it easy for me to  understand is the fact that there are just two simple concepts behind the way   Folders work. Once you understand them it's an easy ride from there.  The key to understanding virtual folders The key to understanding virtual folders is simply this: UCM Virtual Folders are just  another way of displaying collections of content items that "go together". They look  and feel like folders on a Windows system, but really they are "virtual". This makes  them as easy to use as your plain old Windows filesystem folders, but it also makes  them much more powerful and exciting.   Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV  New upcoming UCM v.11g is packed with major upgrades to desktop integration  suite and virtual folders, that make them even better. Once it is released, I'll be  demonstrating those to my newsletter subscribers, so be sure to claim your free  subscription. You will find the link and the instructions in Appendix A. So here are the two, more specific facts to keep in mind, while reading this chapter:   	 Folders are standalone virtual structures. Content items are not physically  stored in them. Every content item has a metadata field  xCollectionId   to store a numeric folder ID that links an item to a folder.   	 Every folder has its own set of metadata fields. They're applied to new   content items and folders created in that folder.  That's it. You have the key now. And here's the rest of the knowledge you'll need   to use Folders. Let's begin by exploring virtual folders.  Exploring virtual folders In this section we'll explore the major controls for using and configuring Folders,  see some non-intuitive features to beware of, and check out the global configuration  settings. But first of all, in case you didn't already, let's see what the Folders user  interface looks like.  So let's begin with the major controls.  Understanding major controls Log in to Content Server. Expand the Browse Content tray on the left  as shown in  the following screenshot :  [ 144 ]   All of your active folders will reside underneath Contribution Folders. If you delete  a folder, its content will go into Trash. When you select a folder its content displays  on the right pane  as shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 6  As you see, Accounting has two content items and one subfolder. I've expanded the  menu on the top right. It works the same way as the menu on the Content Info page.  You can update folder information, move, delete, and create subfolders.  Subfolders and content items in the folder all have their own context menus just like  they do in search results screen  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 145 ]   Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV  As I mentioned earlier, each folder has its own set of metadata. Here's how to  bring it up. On the folder page select Information or Folder Information on its  context menu. The Hierarchical Folder Information screen comes up  as shown in  the following screenshot :  Doesn't it look just like a Content Info page? When you check in a new item in the  folder these are the values that will be prefilled in the Check In form. And you can  update folder metadata fields just like you would on a content item.  [ 146 ]   Chapter 6  So far it all looks pretty simple and logical. But theres are a couple of the "odd bits" I  don't want you to trip over.  Beware of "non-intuitive" behavior Here're a couple of things that are not immediately obvious from the first glance.   The first one is the understanding of how inheritance works.  How inheritance works When you create a subfolder or a new content item in a folder, they inherit the  parent's metadata values. That's clear. But it actually ends there. The items are on  their own after that. If you update the values on the parent it stays on the parent.  Child folders and content items will NOT reflect an update.  Another "quirk" to beware of is the fact that the item's metadata is NOT affected  when you move it to another folder. It won't inherit that folder's values unless you  explicitly push the values down.  And here's how to do it by using the Propogate feature. Using the Propagate feature This is what pushes the metadata values down onto the subfolders and content items  that reside in the folder. Just select Propagate from the menu on the top right on the  folder information page  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 147 ]   Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV  But don't be surprised if it does nothing! That's right. Before you can use the Propagate  feature, you need to specify what metadata fields are OK to push down.  Here's how you do it: Expand the Administration tray. Expand Folder Configuration and click on  Information Field Inherit Configuration. Here's what the Information Field  Inherit Configuration screen looks like:  [ 148 ]   Just place check marks against the fields you'd like to push down when you use the  propagate feature, and click on Update. You're done. Now you can propagate the  metadata values.  Chapter 6  And yes, you can "lock" the folder's metadata values so it can't be  overwritten by propagating form its parent. Set the folder's Inhibit  Propagation metadata value to True.  Great! We now know how folders handle metadata.  Understanding folder security Again, there are two constructs at play here:   	 Each virtual folder has an owner. It's a user who can change that folder's  metadata and delete the folder. However, the folder owner doesn't have   any additional privileges over the content items that reside in the folder.  	 Users can only see the folder if they have at least Read permission to its   Security Group, or if the folder has no security group assigned.  If you're not the owner of a specific folder, you must have Delete permission to its  security group to update its metadata or delete the folder.  However, before you can delete a folder, you'll need to delete or move its entire  content first. And again, content items in a folder may have different values for  Security Group and Account than the folder itself.  We're almost done. All that's left to look at is some settings.  [ 149 ]   Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV  Important global settings Actually, there's just one page I want you to peek at. It's the System Defaults page.  Expand Folder Configuration under the Administration tray. Click on the System  Default Information Fields link  as shown in the following screenshot :  This is another screen that shows your metadata fields, looking like a Check In?   Why is this screen important?  You see, in the next section we'll be using Windows Explorer to drag and drop new  documents into the Content Server. Yes, you can simply drag and drop a document  from your computer and it will get checked in! But there's a little caveat.  [ 150 ]   Chapter 6  Your Standard Check In form may have a few fields marked as required. When you  drag and drop a document there's no way to collect the values for some or all of  these fields. So you need to specify the defaults. If a folder where you are dropping  content has those values then it's perfect. But if it doesn't, the check-in will fail. So  you need to set default values for those required fields.  But don't set anything for Release Date; it will be set to the actual date and time of  your check in.  How to use WebDAV and Desktop  Integration In case you haven't heard of WebDAV, it's an industry standard protocol for editing  and managing files remotely. Content Server supports WebDAV and so do Microsoft  Office, Windows Explorer, and countless other products. You can integrate Content  Server into your users' desktop and make document management easy and seamless.  The only problem is that when contributing content from third-party applications  via WebDAV, the check-in screen will not come up, and the check-in process may  fail because the required field values are missing. It may also become a bigger issue,  when the content is checked in without other important metadata values and that  makes it hard to locate and classify.  But the good news is that you can actually do something about it.  Just set up your default metadata values like I've shown you in the previous section.  And there's also a way to set up your own default metadata values.  So let's pause here for just a moment to see the controls you have for customizing  folder behavior.  Customizing folder behavior There are two things you can do to customize your folder behavior:   	 Define the values that metadata fields should take when you contribute  content via WebDAV, where no check-in form is displayed  those will  override the system default values    	 Customize user interface features when working with Folders in    your browser  Let me show you both.  [ 151 ]   Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV Defining the user default metadata values Once again, note that these default values are only used when you contribute  content via the WebDAV link and no check-in form is filled in.  There are two sets of them, one for creating new content items and one for   creating new revisions of existing content items. To set them up expand the My Content Server tray on your left and follow the  links under Folder Configuration at the bottom of the tray  as shown in the  following screenshot :  And here's how to access the screen for customizing folder user interface features. Customizing Folder user interface features Once again, this screen, as opposed to the ones we've just looked at only deals with  the Content Server interface, the one that you see in a browser. To change these settings, expand the My Content Server tray on the left and  click on the Folder Configuration link towards the bottom of the tray. The  Folder Configuration screen comes up  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 152 ]   Chapter 6  You can now change things such as what file will come up when you click on the  link, whether or not do you want to see hidden folders and if you need to use the  Recycle Bin functionality.  Using Oracle Desktop Integration Oracle Desktop Integration is a lightweight integration product that makes it easy  to consume and contribute content directly from your Windows desktop, Microsoft  Office, and Lotus Notes applications.  At the time of this writing, Oracle Desktop Integration only runs on  Windows. If your client base is running Linux or MacOS you might want  to skip past the following section.  Desktop Integration is also easy to set up. Let me walk you through...  First, you need to download the product. Here's how you go about it. There are two  ways of downloading Oracle Desktop Integration.  [ 153 ]   Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV Downloading Oracle Desktop Integration First of all, you can download it from the Oracle UCM Downloads page. Just Google  for Oracle UCM Downloads and search the page for Desktop Integration Suite. If  for some reason you're unable to find it, here's a little bit longer way of getting it:  1.  Go to E-Delivery website.  You might want to check Chapter 1, Getting Up and   Running, for a refresher on how to get there .  2.  Download Content Server Document Management bundle  the one shown   in the following screenshot :  3.  Once completed, look inside the .zip file. You need a file named something   like Desktop_10gR3_20090702.zip.  4.  Extract and unzip it.  Now we ready to proceed to the next step.  [ 154 ]   Chapter 6  Installing the Content Server component It's actually easier than it sounds. Here are the steps you follow:  1.  Unzip the Desktop Integration archive. Go to the Component folder. It should   contain a file named something like DesktopIntegrationSuite.zip.  2.  Bring up the Admin Server screen  See Chapter 2, Major Controls,   for instructions .  3.  Click on the Component Manager link on the left. Component Manager   comes up  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 155 ]   Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV  4.  Click on the Browse button and locate the ZIP file you located in the   previous step.  5.  Click on Install. 6.  Enable the Component and restart Content Server.  All done! Now it's time to install a client component on your desktop PC.  If you're running in a virtual environment, you can install your client  component there. Nothing prevents you from running your Desktop  Client on the same machine as your Content Server.  Let's proceed to installing the client component.  Installing the client component This one is even easier:  1.  Copy OracleDesktopIntegrationSuite.msi to the client machine where   you'll be installing Desktop Integration and run it.  2.  You can select programs that your end users will use to contribute content    as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 156 ]   3.  Once installation is complete, you'll notice an Oracle Content Servers icon   placed on your desktop  like the one shown in the following screenshot :  Chapter 6  4.  Right-click on it and select Add Server.... 5.  The Add Server Dialog comes up  as shown in the following screenshot :  6.  Simply type in your server name or IP address in the Server Name box at the   top. The other two text boxes will get populated automatically.  7.  OK the dialog.  Your installation is now complete! Let's see what Desktop Integration can do for you.  Let's proceed to Lab 5.  [ 157 ]   Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV  Lab 5: Contributing content using WebDAV  and Windows Explorer Let's start with Windows Explorer. You might not be paying much attention to it,  but I bet this is the top application you use.  Windows Explorer supercharged Carry out the following steps:  1.  Double-click on the Oracle Content Servers icon on your desktop. Windows   Explorer opens. Go to View  Explorer Bar  Folders. You don't have to  show folders, but it makes it convenient to explore virtual folders.  2.  Expand your Content Server. Expand Contribution Folders and select a  folder that has content in it. Select an item. You'll see that item's metadata  appear in the bottom pane, just as it would in the content info page  as  shown in the following screenshot :  3.   If you don't have any content items in this folder, it might be a good time to  put one there. Simply drag or copy-and-paste a small document from My  Documents  or some other place on your machine . The item will be checked  in and will show up in the folder.  [ 158 ]   Chapter 6  If the item doesn't show up check your Content Server log for  error messages. Did you forget to specify System Defaults?  4.  Right-click on a content item and pick Check Out  as shown in the   following screenshot :  5.  The icon changes to confirm that the item is indeed checked out. Now you    can double-click on it to modify and save changes  as shown in the   following screenshot :  [ 159 ]   Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV  6.  Select View  Details from your menu. Now right-click on a column heading    such as Name , and pick Column Settings. You'll see Content Server  metadata fields that you can conveniently show in columns  as shown in the  following screenshot :  Pretty neat, isn't it? And that's not all! If you have MS Office Installed, here's what  you can do with Outlook. Let's take a look at Outlook e-mails.  Checking in Outlook e-mails with just one click Let me show you how it works:  1.  Launch your Outlook. Notice the Check In Mail Item button added to your   toolbar  as shown in the following screenshot :  [ 160 ]   2.  Select an e-mail and click on Check In Mail Item. This brings up a familiar  Check In form in your Outlook! And your Title is already prefilled with the  subject of the e-mail  as shown in the following screenshot . You will also  see your default values prepopulated and your required fields displayed in  dark red—just like the regular Check In form that you're used to seeing in the  main Content Server interface:  Chapter 6  3.  Fill in the info you need to and click on Check In. A confirmation dialog   displays  as shown in the following screenshot :  4.  Congratulations! The check-in is now complete.  [ 161 ]   Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV  There's one more point I want to make about Outlook integration: Yes, you   can separate attachments and check them in as content items in their own right.   Go to Tools  Email Client Integration Settings in your Outlook to configure  this behavior.  If you're using Lotus Notes—you too will be able to reap the benefits of one-click  e-mail check-in and seamless Content Server integration.  Perfect! Now let's see how other Office Applications are integrated with   Content Server.  Contributing documents from Word Since Word is by far the most used application in from Microsoft Office, let's look  at Word. The integration is really very simple. When you save a new document,  a dialog box comes up, offering you to save the document in Content Server  see  screenshot below :  You can agree or decline. If agreed, a check-in form comes up  as shown in the  following screenshot . Doesn't it look like the one you have just seen come up in  Outlook? It sure does—it's the same form!  [ 162 ]   Chapter 6  That's it!  I told you it would be a quick chapter. And all that's left to look at is just a quick  Summary.  Summary You've just learned why Virtual Folders are "virtual", how content items are linked  to them, and what they can do for you. You've also seen how to install Windows  Desktop Component and how to use it for seamless integration with Explorer and  MS Office applications.  In the next chapter we will have some fun and take a deep dive into the inner  workings of Content Server to see how things really work, and get some helpful  insights too. See you soon.  [ 163 ]    Under the Hood  Welcome back! This chapter has a ton of time-saving tips and new approaches  that you can start using right away. I'll take you "behind the curtain" on two major  aspects of Content Server—its physical installation and its user interface. Here're  some of the things you'll learn:   	 How to automate tedious and mind-numbing manual updates and "roll    them out" to thousands of items almost instantly   	 A quick and easy way to debug configuration changes and custom   components that make hidden errors "pop right out"   	 A little handy utility that makes changing global settings a breeze; no more   risky edits of the cryptic global configuration file   	 A sneak peak at how documents are physically stored and what makes   Content Server so efficient  Let's get started with the nine important directories.  Nine important directories: Which ones  will make your life easier? In Chapter 3, Metadata, we looked at the database structure. We've seen how metadata  values are stored in the database. What about the items themselves? Let's explore  Content Sever installation folder. I'll show you where the actual content is stored,  and we will discover a ton of goodies along the way. If you're using a virtual machine we built in Chapter 1, Getting Up and Running,  then browse to C:\oracle\ucm\server folder. If you've changed the folder during  installation, or if you're running on UNIX, your installation path will be slightly  different. You'll see a bunch of subdirectories. Let's explore the critical ones. Let's  start with admin.   Under the Hood  admin This is where Admin Server is installed. If you need a refresher flip back to Chapter 2,  Major Controls.  Here's what the directory looks like:  Admin Server can handle multiple Content Server instances, and allows you to start  and stop them and to change their configuration. But there is no easy way to start  and stop Admin Server itself. So here's how you do it. On Windows IdcAdminNT.exe is running as a service. You can start and stop it from  Administrative Tools  Services.  On UNIX it's just IdcAdmin.  The following screenshot shows how you can remove it and add back in:   	 -uninstall option removes the service registration.  	 -install_autostart option installs the service with an option to   start automatically.  Great! Now let's look at the next directory: bin.  [ 166 ]   bin This is where the executable for Content Server itself resides. The directory  also contains a few valuable admin apps and utilities  as shown in the   following screenshot :  Chapter 7  Let's look at the most important ones:   	 BatchLoader—a handy tool that lets you do mass-check-ins, updates,   and deletes. I will show you how to use it in the next chapter.   	 ComponentWizard—a wizard you can use when developing your own    	 IdcAnalyze—a consistency and error-checking tool for your file store   custom components.  and database.  it later in this chapter.   	 IdcCommand—a tool for executing Content Server services. We will look at    	 IdcServer and IdcServerNT.exe—the actual Content Server executables.  	 SystemProperties—easy enough, it's a tool that lets you edit system  properties so you don't have to do dangerous direct edits directly on a  configuration file.  Let's pause here for just a moment and see how a couple of these tools can make  your life a lot easier. The first one we shall look at is SystemProperties.  [ 167 ]   Under the Hood SystemProperties: An easy way to manage  configuration As I mentioned in Chapter 2, you should be extremely careful when changing the  main Content Server configuration file. On top of that, some of the property names  are not self-explanatory and some such as DB password, you just can't change  directly in the file. The SystemProperties utility offers an easy solution. Let's use it to update IP address filter—a setting that controls what IP addresses  can initiate a trusted connection into your instance. If you didn't change that during  installation, your filter setting will be set to 127.0.0.1. Let's append a pipe character  and the IP of the server itself; you'll also need this in place for work will do in the  next sections.  Start SystemProperties. The utility main screen will come up  as shown in the  following screenshot ; switch to the Server tab and make the edits. As you can see, the tabs across the top represent different sections of Content Server  configuration. The Server tab, that we have open, shows you the Server Configuration  page, where you can change the system locale, time zone, menu label, enable support  for JSP, and, most importantly for us, edit the server IP Address filter.  When you are done, restart Content Server for the changes to take effect. And here's  another handy trick you might like.  [ 168 ]   Chapter 7  Starting Content Server as a standalone process Sometimes you face a serious error that prevents your Content Server from starting.  It might happen after a component installation or after a configuration change.  If that happens, it's critical for you to see the output of the Content Server process  itself, and you can't see it because the actual user interface depends on it being up  and running. So how would you do it?  The answer is quite simple. Just start IdcServer from a command window.  Make sure your Content Server is not running before trying this.  Otherwise you'll be trying to start a second instance and it won't start  because the first instance is using the port where it needs to listen.  You'll see it starting right before your eyes and any errors will pop up  as shown in  the following screenshot :  And now let's continue exploring our Content Server installation. The next directory  we shall look at is Config.  config This is the directory where main Content Server configuration file resides. If you  didn't guess, it's called config.cfg.  [ 169 ]   Under the Hood  This is a typical UNIX configuration file and it also looks very similar to Windows  INI files. You can comment out unwanted values by placing a hash character in front  of them. Here's a little fragment showing the IP Filter changes we just made with the  System Properties utility:  Content Server System Properties IDC_Name=idcm1 IdcProductName=idccs SystemLocale=English-US InstanceMenuLabel=idcm1 InstanceDescription=idcm1  SocketHostAddressSecurityFilter=127.0.0.1 SocketHostAddressSecurityFilter=127.0.0.110.10.10.3  Make sure you back up this file before editing it or running the SystemProperties  utility. You may also choose to comment out the old values and insert new rows for  the new settings, just like I did with the SocketHostAddressSecurityFilter in the  example above. After you run SystemProperties or manually edit the file—restart Content Serer  for the changes to come in effect. The next directory we shall look at is custom.  custom custom is a home for Content Server components. Every one of them has its own  directory underneath it. We will be looking at custom components in Chapter 10,  Customizing Oracle UCM, so let's proceed to the next directory, database.  database This is where all database creation scripts reside. If you chose to skip creating a  database during setup, these are the scripts you'll need to use to create your database  schema and initialize your tables.  They may also be handy when migrating to another database vendor, in which case  you can use the scripts to create the structure in your new database, and then copy  your data over  you may also choose to use the content migration tools, described in  Chapter 9, Migrating Configuration .  The following screenshot shows the content of the database directory:  [ 170 ]   Chapter 7  Use your database SQL execution utility to run these scripts, such as sqlplus with  Oracle and isql with MS SQL Server. When running the scripts, always make sure  that you run them in the following order:  intradoc.sql default.sql formats.sql format_defaults.sql users.sql workflow.sql  For some databases there may also be an all.sql script  shown on the previous  screenshot , which runs all the above scripts in a single operation and in the   correct order. The Database section of the Content Server Installation Guide has more information  for each respective database.  And now let's look at the next directory, which is idcplg.  [ 171 ]   Under the Hood  idcplg You must've noticed idcplg in almost every single URL of the Content Server user  interface  as shown in the following screenshot :  This is because it relies on a web server filter to intercept and handle all the requests.  There're many benefits to this approach. One is that you don't need to incur a  slow and resource-intensive database query just to check permissions and fulfill a  document request. To cut a long story short—the actual filter resides in this directory. Good to know  when your web server configuration "gets out of whack". The next directory we shall look at is called install.  install We've seen this directory in Chapter 1, when we were installing Content Server. The  critical file here that comes very handy is log.txt. Make sure you check it for lines  beginning with ERROR when installing new Content Server instances. If errors are  found in this log file then your installation will most likely fail. So be sure that before you select proceed with install in the Content Server installer,  you browse to the install directory and check log.txt. Every error has a detailed  description that makes it easy for you to rectify the situation just like this one below:  ERROR:  Unable to create database connection... Unknown server  host name ...   You've seen this error in Chapter 1.  And now let's look at weblayout.  [ 172 ]   Chapter 7  weblayout And here's where the actual content is stored. In fact, content is stored in two places.  The web-viewable version or rendition is stored here and the native file along with  its version history is stored in the Vault. Why?  Support of multiple renditions is actually one of the strongest features of Oracle UCM  Document Management. Here're a few examples that should bring it home for you:   	 When you have a large scanned document stored in UCM, its web-viewable  rendition may be a thumbnail version of the document. This will let the user  see the image almost instantly without having to wait a long time for entire  image to download over a slow connection.   	 When you store an engineering document that requires a custom viewer to   open and the user machine may not have that viewer installed—a PDF or  GIF version may be displayed as a web-viewable rendition.   	 When a company publishes a press release in a form of the MS Word   document, but would like it to become an HTML page on their website— UCM's Dynamic Converter does just that instantly and automatically.  In fact, I'm sure you've been asking yourself a question; what Primary and Alternate  File boxes are for on a check-in screen. Now you know the answer. The Primary File  becomes a web-viewable rendition and the Alternate is its native file.  So here's how web-viewable renditions are stored  as shown in the   following screenshot :  [ 173 ]   Under the Hood  Wow! This structure has a lot of levels in it! But wait, it's not as complex as it seems.  It's simply one directory per security group, then one directory per content account,  and one per content type. Inside there is an actual file of a web-viewable rendition.  The name of the file is its Content ID. That's all.  Why such a structure? The answer is really simple. It's optimized for very fast  retrieval. So there's no need to query the database to determine whether a user can  access a document.  And now let me bring up a question that many of our clients ask me: Do you have to  store your content in the file system? You will find the answer in the next section.  Exploring your options for physical content storage So do you have to store your content in the file system? The answer is "Nope, you  don't have to". Depending on your specific situation, you may reap sizable rewards  by choosing not to go with the default option and not to store your content in a file  system. At least not all of it in the same one. The reasons include:   	 You can store your content in the database to make for much easier to   backup and recover.   	 You can store some content on the file system and some in another device   like an NAS or SAN or database, or other device.   	 You may chose to store your content in a distributed, round-robin manner   across a bunch of network storage devices.   	 You may store just the native files and not web viewables.  Or you may go for some combination of all of the above.  And another old-time myth shattered: Contrary to the common belief, storing content in a database may work faster  than the file system-based storage. When using Oracle 11g Database Secure Files  the ability to store  unstructured content in the DB  the file system I O speeds have been  benchmarked faster than Linux file system I O for read write objects!  Imagine being able to store only your frequently used items on the file system,  because they are optimized for quick retrieval by the web server. Other items can be  stored in the database or on lower-cost storage tiers, so that you get all the power of  UCM without the need for storing old content on high-cost storage devices.  [ 174 ]   Chapter 7  This is especially good for enterprise systems and systems where you have a  combination of archival and high use content.  You can even make the Content Server move your content from one device  to another with a simple metadata field update! Such an update can be done  automatically, manually, or through a workflow.  So how would you go about setting up one of these configurations in your own  system? Pick up a copy of the File Store Provider Installation and Administration  Guide from the Oracle online documentation page. That's right—File Store Provider   FPS  is the tool you need. And now let's look at the next directory, the one that often goes hand-in-hand with  weblayout. It's called vault and we shall look at it in the next section.  vault And here's where the native files are stored. There're a lot more files stored here, than  there are in the weblayout. vault contains all the historic revisions. Here's what the  file structure looks like:  One directory per content type and one per content account, then there are the native  files. File names this time are the dID values; globally unique Document Identifiers,  one per revision.  [ 175 ]   Under the Hood  Just move your mouse over a Native File link or Revision labels on the Content Info  page, and watch the status bar for link URLs. Notice the dID values change to reflect  unique document identifiers for every revision as shown in the following screenshot:  Didn't you notice what a mega-time-saver there is in the status bar at the bottom  of the screenshot? The next section shows you a mega-time-saver you can spot by  simply looking at the status bar.  Introducing Content Server services A Mega-Time-Saver? I'm not kidding! Have another look at the URL on the status  bar in the previous screenshot. Did you notice IdcService=GET_FILE right after the  question mark? Yes, it's true. Every page display, every file retrieval, every update  operation, and everything a Content Server does is a service call. Why is that such a  big deal?  It's because we're no longer confined by the User Interface. We don't have to make  600 mouse clicks and wait for 200 server calls if we need to add 100 new users to  the system. We can simply run a script that calls ADD_USER service and work on  something else while it runs!  Let me tell you more in the next section.  Services architecture Service Oriented Architecture is a buzzword these days. You have probably heard  it or its acronym SOA. The reality is that long before it became a buzzword, the  Content Server had been built that way  going way back to 1996 . This means it is  perhaps one of the most mature SOA systems out there today. So here's how Content Server documentation defines Service:  [ 176 ]   Chapter 7  A service is a function or procedure that is performed by the content server. Calling a content  server service  making a service request  is the only way a client can communicate with the  content server or access the database.  There are literally hundreds of them. There's one group of services for every aspect  of Oracle UCM. For example, there're a dozen or so services that deal with virtual  folders. So how do you find their names and instructions on how to call them? Here's how. Begin by downloading a copy of the Services Reference from the UCM  online documentation page.  Type "oracle universal content management documentation library" into Google.  Search for Services Reference Guide under Content Server.  At the time of this writing, this guide has over five hundred pages. It  doesn't make it hard to use, because the services are very well organized by  feature, such as workflow, folders, core content server services, and so on. The size of this guide simply gives you an idea of how granular and  flexible the Services Architecture really is. It's hard to imagine a Content  Server task that you cannot accomplish with a sequence of service calls.  Here's what the page should look like:  In the following sections I'll show you a way to use the Content Server services, and  to make your life as UCM administrator much easier.  And now let me save you a couple of hours and help you to get started. Let's begin  by understanding the structure of the HDA files.  [ 177 ]   Under the Hood  Understanding HDA files Before you can call services, you need to understand how to pass parameters to a  service call. Most often, the parameters are simply passed on the URL, but sometimes,  it's done via an HDA file. You will need to understand this simple file format, so here's  a five-minute primer. It will be even more helpful for you to grasp, considering that  most of the Content Server configuration files are also in HDA format.  HDA stands for Hyper Data. It's a compact way for storing name-value pairs and  tabular data. It's a specially formatted text file. An HDA file can have three types   of sections:   	 LocalData sections that contain key-value pairs  	 ResultSet sections for tabular data  	 OptionList sections that simply list the options in a list  Here's a sample HDA file, used to add users to Content Server:  <?hda version="5.1.1  build011203 " jcharset=Cp1252  encoding=iso-8859-1?>  Add users  @Properties LocalData  IdcService=ADD_USER dName=jdoe dUserAuthType=Local dFullName=John Doe dPassword=password dEmail=jdoe@testco.com @end  @ResultSet UserAttribInfo 2 dUserName AttributeInfo jsmith role,contributor,15 @end   >  Notice that the file starts with an XML-like header. Every line beginning with a  number sign is considered a comment and ignored. A LocalData section is declared with the line @Properties LocalData and  terminated with @end. Inside are simple name-value pairs of metadata field  names and their values.  [ 178 ]   A ResultSet section is declared by @ResultSet   and  terminated with @end. Groups of sections in the file are terminated by  >. If I wanted to add two  users, my file would look like this:  <?hda version="5.1.1  build011203 " jcharset=Cp1252  encoding=iso-8859-1?>  Chapter 7  User 1 @Properties LocalData ... @end @ResultSet UserAttribInfo ... @end  >  User 2 @Properties LocalData ... @end @ResultSet UserAttribInfo ... @end  >  The ResultSet section does look confuting but it's really quite simple, once you  understand how it works: The first line after @ResultSet   contains the number of fields  in the result set  or columns in your table . Let's say, we have three fields. The next  three lines then will have the names of the fields, and the rest of the section is the  table data.  If line zero was the number of columns, then lines one to three are the column  names, the lines four to six will have the values in the first row of the table, the lines  seven to nine will have the second row and so on:  @ResultSet SampleTable  3 number of columns   Column names: Column1 Column2 Column3   Row 1  [ 179 ]   Under the Hood  Row1_Col1 Row1_Col2 Row1_Col3   Row 2 Row2_Col1 Row2_Col2 Row2_Col3  @end  The following table illustrates how this result set would look in a database:  Column1 Row1_Col1 Row2_Col1  Column2 Row1_Col2 Row2_Col2  Column3 Row1_Col3 Row2_Col3  Now it looks simple, isn't it? Just one comment though—in real life you don't want to  put blank lines and comments inside your record sets!  If you need more information on HDA file format refer to The Definitive  Guide to Stellent Content Server Development   2006 by Brian Huff.  That's it. We're now ready to make our first service call. So here's an easy way to do it.  An easy way to call Content Server services There are many ways to call the services. To me, the easiest one is by using the  IdcCommand utility. That's right, the one we've seen in the bin folder in Content  Server installation. Before using IdcCommand make sure that the IP Address Filter setting includes the IP  address of the server itself. See the section on System Properties earlier in this chapter  for instructions on how to change it.  You may want to check out the Idc command reference guide available in  the UCM Document Library if you need more info on the IDC Command  Let me give you a couple of examples to get you started:  [ 180 ]   Example 1: Creating folders Let's see how we can create a bunch of folders using script:  Begin by creating an HDA file:  <?hda version="5.1.1  build011203 " jcharset=Cp1252  encoding=iso-8859-1?>  Chapter 7  @Properties LocalData IdcService=COLLECTION_ADD hasParentCollectionID=true dCollectionName=DK Test Folder 1 dParentCollectionID=2 dCollectionOwner=doej @end  >  @Properties LocalData IdcService=COLLECTION_ADD hasParentCollectionID=true dCollectionName=DK Test Folder 2 dParentCollectionID=2 dCollectionOwner=doej @end  >  Nothing fancy here. Two groups of sections, one for each folder we create, both  containing only the name-value pairs. Each contains the following fields:   	 IdcService=COLLECTION_ADD, the name of the service we're calling  	 hasParentCollectionID=true, to specify that we're adding a sub-folder  	 dCollectionName=DK Test Folder 2, the name of the folder we're creating  	 dParentCollectionID=2, Collection ID of the parent folder that we can see   in the browser's status bar when moving the mouse cursor over that folder   	 dCollectionOwner=doej, the owner of that virtual folder  Let's say we name it create_folder.hda and put in c:\temp. Here's how to put it into action:  C:\oracle\ucm\server\bin>IdcCommand.exe -f c:\Temp\create_folder.hda -u  sysadmin  -l c:\Temp\log.txt -c auto  [ 181 ]   Under the Hood  Here's a list of parameters we've used:   	 -f—the path to the HDA command file  	 -u—the name of the user performing the change  	 -l—the path to the log file  	 -c—Content Server connection mode, which you can always keep at auto  And here's how a successful call should look:  A quick mental note, if you delete the folders and call the service again be prepared  to see something like this:  1 4 10: Error executing service COLLECTION_ADD. Unable to create virtual  folder. Item with name 'DK_Test_Folder' already exists in folder '  Contribution Folders  Accounting Payable '. Why? The folders were not really deleted. They were moved to the Trash folder.  Delete them from there and re-run IdcCommand to see it succeed.  And here's another example of using services.  Example 2: Mass-updating content info This one is really simple. Just put the content IDs, Revision IDs  dID , and the  metadata you want to change in an HDA file, and you're ready to roll.  This one will change the security group, content account, and document title:     <?hda version="5.1.1  build011203 " jcharset=Cp1252  encoding=iso-8859-1?> @Properties LocalData IdcService=UPDATE_DOCINFO dDocName=test dID=1 dDocTitle=Packt Wallpaper dSecurityGroup=accounting dDocAccount=accounting receivable current  @end  >  [ 182 ]   And here's the result of the service call:  Chapter 7  And here're the familiar "before" and "after" screenshots of the Content Info page.  Before:  [ 183 ]   Under the Hood  And after the update:  And here's another scenario where calling services can save you time; I've mentioned  it earlier in this chapter.  Example 3: Batch—creating users The following command file executes the ADD_USER service to create two new users  complete with their data, role membership, and security accounts:  <?hda version="5.1.1  build011203 " jcharset=Cp1252  encoding=iso-8859-1?>  Add users @Properties LocalData IdcService=ADD_USER dName=jdoe dUserAuthType=Local dFullName=John Doe dPassword=pwd  [ 184 ]   Chapter 7  dEmail=john@testco.com @end   ResutlSet that specifies user attributes: @ResultSet UserAttribInfo 2 dUserName AttributeInfo jdoe role,contributor,15,account, all, 7 @end  >  @Properties LocalData IdcService=ADD_USER dName=dbrown dUserAuthType=Local dFullName=Derek Brown dPassword=password dEmail=derek@testco.com @end  @ResultSet UserAttribInfo 2 dUserName AttributeInfo dbrown role,contributor,15,account,manufacturing,7 @end  >  Note that for every user record you will need to create a LocalData section to store  user information such as their name and e-mail address, and one ResultSet to  specify their roles and accounts.  Use the following values for the Access Numbers that define user permissions:   	  	  	  	  1: Read only 3: Read and write 7: Read, write, and delete 15: Administrative permissions  You can also use all, the special value that gives the user access to all accounts.  [ 185 ]   Under the Hood  And here's the result of the service call—the users have been created  see the  following screenshot :  And here is the Accounts tab for John Doe, showing his Read Write Delete  permissions for All Accounts:  And now let's take a quick look at something even more exciting, creating your   own services!  [ 186 ]   Chapter 7  Creating your own services That's right. You can extend Content Server functionality to perform custom tasks  and integrate in your overall enterprise infrastructure. In Chapter 10, I'll give you a  head start, but you don't have to do those customizations on your own.  I can give you dozens of specific examples when we were able to point our clients  in the right direction, and help them avoid costly customizations with original and  creative use of existing out-of-the-box functionality. We may also be able to help you  minimize your investment when custom development is the only option to achieve  the result you want. Use your Free Critique Certificate and I'll be happy to personally  assess your approach at no cost to you. And here's another option you should always keep in mind. If you cannot possibly  avoid expensive customizations with out-of-the-box UCM functionality, you  may still be able to avoid them with reusable components and pre-built custom  solutions that are readily available from Oracle Partners. If this is the route you are  considering, check Appendix B, Detailed Oracle UCM Resource Directory, for Value- Added Products and Services.  That's it! And all that's left of this chapter is just a quick summary.  Summary There you have it. I hope it was a fun chapter. You've also learned how to automate  tedious tasks, what services are all about, how content is physically stored, how  to debug Content Server start-up problems like a pro, and where the global  configuration settings are actually stored.  In the next chapter I'll show you more ways for automating mind-numbing tasks,  and how to back up and restore your content.  [ 187 ]    Backup, Restore, and  Content Migration  In the previous chapter we took a good look at the Content Server file system. We  now know where and how the content is actually stored. If you were following the  sequence of chapters, by now you're likely to have some configuration changes,  metadata and content that you need to back up. And almost certainly, you have a  bunch of existing content that you'd like to bring over to your new Oracle UCM. If  any of this is true, this chapter will be very timely, because it will show you:   	 The best strategy for protecting your system from user errors, software   malfunctions, and hardware crushes  skip this step and you'll inevitably   lose some critical data forever .   	 A simple coding shortcut that gives you an almost unfair advantage when  migrating content. I've used it to migrate content over 16 times faster than  my client's previous  large and reputable  consultant planned to.   	 How to avoid placing your sensitive business content on public facing   servers so even if they do get compromised the attacker will leave empty  handed.   	 Quick and easy way to archive older content, save disk space, and keep your  system at its peak performance. If you don't adopt this practice, your content  store will grow almost exponentially and you'll constantly face hardware  upgrade issues and new license fees.   	 A handy tool that lets you mass-check-in thousands of content items at once,   this is included free with your Content Server.  And yes, you will learn all of these in the next half an hour or so. But we must get  into it.   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  First of all, let's make sure that your content and your configuration are safe. Let me  show you how to backup and restore.  How to backup and restore I hope you realize that your data can only be really safe when you back it up  regularly. If you lose a document to user error, your system gets corrupted by an  OS patch, your hard disk crashes or your building burns down, you should have a  recent copy of your system stowed somewhere off-site and ready for a quick restore.  That actually brings up a vital lesson I've learned some years that might save you a  few sleepless nights.  These companies were "completely  protected" but lost their data anyway Don't be lulled into a false sense of security when your network group reports  that your servers are backed up, they may not be. The wrong directories might be  selected, leaving your critical content unprotected, or the old tape may be sitting in a  tape drive, or no tape at all! I've seen people get very creative when it comes to doing  things wrong! So never assume. Make sure! How? With these two simple words: demand a periodic Restore Test. Ask for your last week's content. Get it restored on a virtual machine and test it.  Do you see the revisions you need to see or you've got an older copy? Is everything  working as expected? Only then you can be sure.  Let me show what you need to back up. The next section walks you through this.  Backing up filesystem and the database Content Server System Migration Guide says: Caution: Do not use Archiver as your  primary method of disaster recovery; use standard backup systems for the database  and file system.  It means you don't use Content Server tools. Backup your entire Content Server  installation directory and your database.  Combine full and incremental backups to  conserve space. Full backups make a copy of your entire directory, while incremental  ones only store changes made since the last full backup .  [ 190 ]   Chapter 8  And pick your least active time like 4 a.m. when no updates are made. If you backup  a new content item in your filesystem but your database backup was taken earlier  and doesn't contain it then you won't be able to retrieve it or you'll get errors. The  same thing will happen if you get an item in a database, but not in a file system. You  must have both. Hence there should be no updates while the backups are running.  If there's no way to make sure, write a script to stop the service IDC Content  Service on Windows, or call idcserver_stop on UNIX prior to beginning the  backups. When complete start the service on Windows or call idcserver_start if  you're running in a UNIX environment.  If you've customized your File Store Provider and storing your content  in a database, you don't need to stop the Content Server and worry about  synchronization. A single backup of the database covers everything.  Perfect. Now that we got full backups and disaster recovery out of the way,   let's see what partial backups can do for you, partial backups and their three  important applications.  Content Server provides a complete toolset for backup and restore of your content  and configuration. In this chapter will have a look at the main tool, Archiver. In the  next chapter will cover the rest of the toolset.  Archiver is your first choice when it comes to making partial backups. Here're the  three most important things it can do for you.  Moving content to another server You can copy or automatically replicate some of your content from one server to the  other. For instance, you may not want all of your content copied over to your public  site or extranet.  Another very common use of this feature is moving content from Development to  Staging and then to Production and vice versa.  [ 191 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration Removing inactive content You can archive your older or inactive content for permanent or temporary storage,  or delete altogether. This will save your disk space and your CPU cycles. Your  weblayout and your vault file systems will not grow as fast. Your indexer will not  take as long and your database will stay smaller. In some cases old revisions of content items have to be removed on a scheduled basis.  Your company may only want to keep certain content for X number of years and  then permanently delete it, or in case of a lawsuit it can potentially be used against it.  In fact, legal, industry and compliance regulations may dictate storage and  disposition rules and timeframes, how long should the content be stored, and what  action needs to be taken when that period is over.  And here's one more important thing that Archiver can do for you. It can help you  with mass-updating metadata.  Mass-updating metadata Yes, you can use Archiver to mass-update your metadata. It is actually pretty simple.  Just export the content you'll be updating, set up the metadata changes you need to  make in a form of an import map, and then import it right back. I'll show you how to  do just that later in this chapter.  Let's see how all of this fits together.  Lab 9: Using Archiver  Before we get started with the lab, you need to see a couple of term definitions. They  sound familiar, but when it comes to Archiver, they mean totally different things:   	 Batch File: A result of a single export operation. Every time you export to an   archive, a new export folder and a new batch file is created.   	 Collection  Archiver : Collection of archives  not virtual folders! . It is a file  folder with a set of archives in it. Each one containing its own export folders.  One more glance at the Content Server file system will help you internalize these  definitions. Take a look at the screenshot below:  [ 192 ]   Chapter 8  By default, the folder archives under root Content Server installation serves as  default archive collection.  I've created an archive called all_content. I've then ran an export three times, so  you can see three export folders. If you expand them you'll see that they contain their  own partial snapshots of vault and weblayout directories.  Great! We're now ready to start the Archiver. Exporting content Let me walk you through:  1.  Go to Admin Applets and click on Archiver as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 193 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  2.  Archiver applet starts as shown in the following screenshot:  If you're trying to create or remove collections or copy archives - you'll  need to start Archiver in a stand-alone mode. See Content Server System  Migration Guide for more information  3.  Go to Edit  Add. Add Archive dialog displays as shown in the following   screenshot. Enter the name for your archive  no spaces allowed  and its  description:  [ 194 ]   Chapter 8  4.  Go to Actions  Export. Export Archive screen comes up as shown in the   following screenshot:  Archive operations may take a long time when you have a significant  number of content items to process. To save time you might be better off  running these examples on a test system with under 500 content items.  5.  You can choose to move your content to archive  Delete After Successful  Archiving option  or copy it there when the box is not checked. Let's check  Delete After Successful Archiving. When you click on OK export operation  begins.  [ 195 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  6.  And here comes the heart attack! Your content store is now EMPTY!  as   shown in the following screenshot :  If you don't see results of your export or import operation you may  need to force-rebuild an index to see the changes right away. Here's  how you do this:  7.  Go To Admin Applets and start Repository Manager. 8.  Go to Indexer tab. 9.  Click on Start button under Collection Rebuild Cycle as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 196 ]   Chapter 8  Warning! If you have a lot of items in the system then this will  take a while.  [ 197 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  10.  On the General tab of your Archiver applet click on View Batch Files button.   View Batch Files dialog displays as shown in the following screenshot:  11.  Click on Edit button. You'll now see the content of the batch file's   export folder.  12.  Click on the Import button. Rebuild your index to see the results right  away. Voila! Your content is back!  Checkout the following screenshot :  [ 198 ]   13.  Expand Administration tray. Select Log Files  Archiver Logs. You  can now see exactly what Archiver is doing. This is especially useful   for troubleshooting, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 8  That's it for exporting content. In the next section we will look at Importing content.  [ 199 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration Importing content Are you up for a little magic? Here it comes. Let's say, you'd like to change the  author on all the documents you're about to import from sysadmin to doej. Here's  how you'll do it:  1.   In Archiver's Import Maps tab click on Edit button next to Value Maps box  as shown in the following screenshot. Specify the value you need replaced  under Input Value, specify your field and the new value under Output  Value. And yes you can replace multiple values in multiple fields all at the  same time!  Sometimes, you'd want to copy or move ALL values from one field over to  another. Let's say, you need to copy the value of the document's title  dDoc- Titile  to a custom Vendor Name field we've defined  xVendor .  2.  Click on Edit button next to Field Maps box. Export field is the original field  in your archive  remember to click on Add to add your expression to the list  of field maps!  as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 200 ]   Chapter 8  3.  Rerun your import and re-index repository. You'll see the new values in   Author and Vendor fields as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 201 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  But wait! Do you always have to archive your entire repository? How do you update  metadata on just the documents in Accounting? And how do you only archive  expired content? And how do you only copy public content to an extranet and keep  all sensitive documents private?  Here's how you do it:  1.  Switch to the Export Data tab in Archiver. Let's say, you only want to archive   the content that was checked in before Jan 1st or last year. Click on Edit  button next to Export Query box. Query Definition screen comes up as  shown in the following screenshot:  2.  Specify Release Date as your input Field, Is Date Before as Operator, and   1 1 09 as your Value. Click on Add and OK to close the dialog.  [ 202 ]   3.  Click on Preview button to test how your query works. If you don't see any  results go back and check the criteria. What you see in the preview is what  will be exported into the archive  see the following screenshot :  Chapter 8  You can use the Define Filter… button to filter results and search for  specific records.  That's it! You've now seen all major things that an Archiver can do for you. Well,  almost all.  Setting up real-time content replication If servers one and two are set up for replication, the moment a content item gets  checked-in or updated on server one it gets archived, transferred over to server two  and imported there. And, yes, if you need, you can only replicate a sub-set of your  content, such as public documents. See Content Server System Migration Guide for more information and instructions on  how to set up replication between two Content Servers.  [ 203 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  Now let me tell you more. The minute you're ready to roll out your Oracle UCM  you'll be asking yourself this big question: How do i bring my existing content in?   The next section tells you about this.  How to migrate content—faster than   anyone else thought possible Hold on to your hat! Not only I'll tell you how to bring existing content in, I'll tell  you how to do it fast.  A shortcut to a successful migration Before we take a plunge into Content Server tools, here's a really important   topic to consider: Are you talking about just bringing existing content in or do  you need a content migration? What's the difference? There's plenty. First,  check out Content migrations.  Content migrations A content migration is when you have one or more existing Content Management  systems to consider. On the day of the migration, the old systems become obsolete  and all of the content "magically" appears in the new system. There may be some down time in between. There may also be a content freeze in the  middle, when your old systems become read-only and you have the time to bring  content over. More often than not, content migrations need to be repeatable. This means that  you write down your migration process. You develop a sequence of scripted and  manual steps, required to bring the content over. And you follow them by content  verification steps. You make sure that it has indeed migrated correctly. You go through the migration process more than once. You test it in a development  environment. And when you like the results, you schedule the day of the migration  and repeat your process in production.  A well-planned process is your best shortcut to a successful migration. Script it as  much as possible. Run it in a test environment until you get it right. It's much easier  to tweak the process than clean the content after!  [ 204 ]   Chapter 8  Simply uploading existing documents If all you need is to upload a bunch of documents then your task is really simple.  There is no content freeze and you don't have to migrate all the content at once. It's  a major benefit. You can bring the content in small batches.  But never the less, spend the time and test each little step in development  environment first. It's still easier then fix the content by hand later!  There you have it. Now let's explore the migration tools. First let's take a look at  Batch Loader.  Using Batch Loader Batch Loader is your first choice of a content migration tool. It allows you to  mass-check-in content. You can also use it to update metadata and delete large  number of content items in one shot.  Watch. I'll show you how to use it:  1.  Go to the  bin folder in your Content Server installation directory. Start  BatchLoader. It will ask you for user name and password. Use sysadmin  and idc for the password  unless you've changed it .  2.  Batch Loader comes up as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 205 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  Looks pretty simple, doesn't it? It takes a Batch Load File and processes it. Actually,  there are just three controls I want you to note:   	 Clean up files after successful check in box: Treat it like nitro-glycerine.   When checked, if the file was successfully checked in - it will be wiped out.  So keep the box un-checked if you're not sure.   	 Enable error file for failed revision classes box: This one is actually very  useful. I always make sure that it's checked. It makes your Batch Loader to  move failed records into a new Batch Load File where you can fix the errors  and re-run it.   	 Maximum errors allowed text box: This is the number of errors you   allow before the batch load operation gets terminated. If your content is  inconsistent, you can bump it up. But in most cases, default value is fine. I've  loaded thousands of items with just a couple of errors. If it works it works.  I bet you're curious about how Batch Load File works and how to make one. First, I'll  show you the tool that does all the grunt work:  1.   In Batch Loader select Options  Build Batch File as shown below:  2.  Batch Builder tool comes up. It reads the content of the directory you specify   and generates a Batch Load File that you can use to import this directory.  Batch Builder screen is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 206 ]   Chapter 8  3.  Type up a directory where you will be importing the documents from. Then   4.   browse for location of your future Batch Load File. If you like, you can edit the Field Mapping, hit the Edit button next to  Mapping drop down. Select Default Mapping and hit Edit again. Edit  Mapping dialog displays as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 207 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  As you see, Field Mapping dialog allows you to map metadata fields in the  documents you are about to import to their file name, extension, directory  name, and other file system information.  5.  That's all. Now you're ready to get your Batch Load File built. Hit the Build   button at the bottom.  6.  Let's see what's inside the Batch Load File:  I've kept the matters simple and only placed two documents in K:\Acc_Doc- uments: Invoice_234.doc and Name Change.doc. So here's the Batch Loader  file: Action = insert  dDocName=Invoice_234 dDocTitle= Invoice_234 dDocAuthor=sysadmin dSecurityGroup=Public dDocAccount= dDocType=ADACCT dInDate=1 13 10 4:41 PM primaryFile=k: Acc_Documents Invoice_234.doc  >  dDocName=Name Change dDocTitle=Name Change dDocAuthor=sysadmin dSecurityGroup=Public dDocAccount= dDocType=ADACCT dInDate=1 13 10 4:41 PM primaryFile= k: Acc_Documents Name Change.doc  >  It looks like a name-value section of an HDA file  See Chapter 7, Under the  Hood, for HDA Syntax . It's just a list of metadata field names and values,  terminated by  >. And there's Action = insert in the first line to tell  the Batch Loader that we actually want to insert the documents.  7.  At last, we're ready to import the content. Go back to Batch Loader and run   your file. Here's what I've got on the screen after running my script above:  [ 208 ]   Chapter 8  Ouch! One document didn't import. What happened? Here's where the error file really comes handy. Look in the directory where  your Batch Load Script is. The file name is something like <Batch Load File  Name>_101131650.txt. Here's how the error file looks like: Internal error version !csUnableToCheckIn,name change! csCheckinIDHasSpaces!csCheckinIDNotValid,name change  External error version Content item 'name change' was not successfully checked in. It contains spaces. The content ID 'Name Change' is invalid.  dDocAuthor=sysadmin dDocName=Name Change dInDate=1 13 10 4:49 PM dDocType=ADACCT dDocAccount= dSecurityGroup=Public dDocTitle=Name Change primaryFile= k: Acc_Documents Name Change.doc  >  It's simply a portion of our original Batch Load Script that didn't work! Yes, we can  fix it and use the error file itself as a new Batch Load Script! And it tells you what  went wrong. In our case, we simply need to remove the space in dDocName value.  It's time to check the results. It might take a while for the new content to get indexed,  so if you in a rush, start indexer's Auto Update Cycle  no need to rebuild the entire  index in this case .  Voila! Your batch loaded documents appear in the search results! Is that a neat tool  or what?  [ 209 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  But wait! What about folders? Are you forced to create all the folders by hand? The answer is in idcCommand.  Using idcCommand Nope! I thought it would be handy to refresh this in your mind. Remember the  example I've shown you in the previous chapter where we used idcCommand to  create virtual folders? So here's your answer.  And I kept the best for the last. Here's the final bit that will really bring these tools   to life for you.  A secret "catalyst" that triples the speed   of your migration OK. It's not a secret any more. The Catalyst is Code Generation. No longer you have  to type up your HDA files for use with idcCommand and only rely on the Batch File  Builder to create a perfect Batch Loader Script.  You can use your text editor's search and replace function, a Perl script or a  programming language of your choice to generate those. How?  In my recent article for Independent Oracle UCM Knowledge Center at   http:  stellentexperts.com ioukc, I'm revealing exactly how we managed  to migrate content 16.9 times faster than a large and reputable vendor was planning  to accomplish with a "standard" solution. Dozens of readers reported some massive  time savings with this technique, so I'm reprinting it here.  How we got a project over a finish line 16.9 times  faster Last year we ended up migrating 38 websites and major site sections  10,710 pages in  total  in just over a week each, while a nation-wide reputable vendor estimated each  of them to take three to six months. How did we do it?  The short answer is this: we used Batch Loader, easy enough. Am I simply  comparing a manual import to the use of a tool? Nope. I'm writing this article to  waste your time. After all, that vendor was also using the batch loader. But what   we were really using was the batch loader turbo charged.  [ 210 ]   Chapter 8  Batch loader turbo charged When it comes to a mass-check in the batch loader is a nice and useful tool, but when  you're loading tenths of thousands of files from dozens of locations, and when each  file has unique derived values in its metadata Batch Loader won't be of much help.  I guess that almost any enterprise-scale content migration will have you fall flat on  your face if you're simply relying on Batch Loader to "magically" load your content  into the UCM. The quickest way to automate a migration It's simple. The answer becomes obvious when you look at how the batch loader  works. It processes a typical HDA file, one record at a time. It picks up a file from the  location you specify in primaryFile field, sets metadata values to the ones you tell it  to use, and calls a Check In service. Again, it reads batch loader script one record at a  time and checks in files one by one.  What if we could create some cool batch loader script that will import all the files  we want imported? All at once! Sure, that would be nice, but how do we go about  creating one?  The Batch Builder utility that comes with Batch Loader is very limited. It builds  simple files based on a content of a single directory and lets you use file system data  as metadata. It won't let you pick up files from multiple locations or create complex  metadata values.  So, here's the biggie, to turbo-charge your content migration effort, you need to  consider generating your own batch loader scripts.  And here's how to use code generation effectively. How to use code generation effectively First of all—how do you go about generating it?  For simple migration you can get away with using your editor's search and   replace function on a comma-separated list of files. Let's say, your excel file has   the following columns: Content Id, Title, Author, Security Group, Account, Doc Type, Date,  File Path.  [ 211 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  After you save it in a comma-separated  CSV  format, you'll end up with something  like this: A2561405, Migration Project Plan, Bill, Public, abstract, 8 12 09 4:20 PM,  C: Migration Project Plan v.3.4.doc. Now, you could use a RegEx like this to produce a batch loader script out of your  CSV file. Replace this:  ^ [^,]* , [^,]* , [^,]* , [^,]* , [^,]* , [^,]* , [^,]* , [^,]* $  If you're new to regular expressions, this RegEx says: Begin at the start of a line, select every character until  you see a comma repeated eight times and you must  end up at the end of the line.  With this replacement string:  dDocName=$1\n dDocTitle=$2\n dDocAuthor=$3\n dSecurityGroup=$4\n  dDocAccount=$5\n dDocType=$6\n dInDate=$7\n primaryFile=$8\n  >  \n  You may need to test the RegEx in your own editor as everyone has a slightly  different syntax. After you run it your comma-separated line will transform into   an HDA entry that will look like this:  dDocName=A2561405 dDocTitle=Migration Project Plan dDocAuthor=Bill dSecurityGroup=Public dDocAccount= dDocType=abstract dInDate=8 12 09 4:20 PM primaryFile=C: Migration Project Plan v.3.4.doc  >  I hope you get the idea.  [ 212 ]   How to scale it up You can easily adapt this technique to any complexity. Just use Perl, Ruby, or  another scripting language of your choice to generate metadata values, file names,  and locations.  Be sure to use subroutines, structure your code well, and store it in source-control  system. Code generation script can get quite complex really quickly.  Chapter 8  And now consider these important last minute tips. Important last minute tips Today, there will be three:   	 You'll very likely need to debug your code generation script and run your   batch load file more than once so be sure to:  	  Add a custom meta field or a special value like batch_loader   for the dDocAuthor, so you can find your new loaded test  files quickly, and delete them when it's time to start fresh. Test on a small sub-set  under 200 items  so you don't have to  wait for eight hours for these 500 Gb to import.  	    	 Be sure to CLEAR the Clean up files after successful check in box. If you   leave it checked your source files will be deleted and you won't find them in  Recycle Bin!   	 Be sure to mark Enable error file box. This will create a detailed log file and  a smaller batch loader script file for the files that didn't load. This option is  absolutely essential!  I hope you enjoyed this neat technique that can hopefully save you buckets of time  off your busy content migration schedule.

Check it out now as the information is still fresh in your mind.  Welcome back! Let's spend a few more moments in this chapter. Let's go through this  quick summary.  [ 213 ]   Backup, Restore, and Content Migration  Summary Now you know how to backup and protect your content and system configuration,  how to create partial backups, promote content between environments, and mass- update metadata. You've also seen the secret behind efficient and fast content  migrations so it will be easy for you to bring your existing content in.  In the next chapter you'll learn how to backup your configuration, your complete,  and partial folder structures, and how to transfer them to other servers.  [ 214 ]   Migrating Configuration  In the previous chapter you've seen how to do full and partial backups and how to  migrate data to another Content Server instance. What we didn't cover is how to  back up your system configuration, your workflows, and virtual folders. It's time to  explore the rest of the toolset. In this chapter you will:   	 Learn how you can back up, restore, and migrate system configuration— your custom metadata fields, profile information, workflows, and other  customizations—over to another system, so you can create a complete   replica or just deploy a few selected customizations.   	 Discover two different options to back up, restore, and migrate your virtual   folders with and without content.  Let's get into it. First, let's see what other tools are available to help us with backup, restore,  and migration:   Completing your backup, restore, and  migration toolkit So far, we've seen Archiver, which allows us to export, import, and migrate our   content items and to update metadata. We've also seen how we can use Batch  Loader, Content Server Services, and idcCommand to migrate content to another  server instance.  Now let's look at the tools that complete your toolkit:   	 Configuration Migration Utility  CMU : This is the tool that exports and   imports your Content Server configuration and customizations.   Migrating Configuration   	 Folder Archiving: This is a feature that allows you to export your entire   virtual folder structure into a single HDA file. The content is not included  and you're forced to export and import complete folder structure, not a  subset.   	 Folder Structure Archive Component: This is a free add-on component   that enables you to cherry-pick and export only selected folders you   need—complete with their content.  Perfect. Now that you know what the tools are, let's see how we can use them.  How to migrate your configuration I bet you know the answer. We will need to use Configuration Migration Utility,  the CMU.  One of the things that's great about the CMU is that you can export all of your  settings out of system A and bring them over to system B. And you don't have   to just apply all of your settings there. You can choose exactly what sections and  values to import into system B. It is very handy to have such granular control over  the configuration.  It's a common practice to share a content archive and a CMU bundle  explained in  the next section  with each other to see a particular demo or feature set. It's very  quick and convenient.  I'll walk you through it. But first, you need to see a couple of new terms, which   CMU uses extensively:  Using the CMU There are only two definitions to understand:   	 Configuration Bundle is a set of configuration information that you're   exporting or importing. A bundle is stored in a single ZIP file. You can copy  it over and import on another Content Server instance.   	 Configuration Template  or Export Rule  is a stored set of options that you'd  otherwise have to manually select every time you export a bundle. It's a time  saver, so you can repeat your export with the same settings more than once.  That's it. And now just couple of important tips before we start using the CMU:  [ 216 ]   Chapter 9  The CMU does NOT erase configuration in the target system. It simply  adds the settings you're migrating. Also, it won't overwrite your target configuration settings with matching  values from the bundle—unless you set the Force Overwrite to true when  you import a bundle. Only then will the matching values actually be  overwritten.  All set. Let's start the CMU now. I'll walk you through it in the next section.  Exporting your settings Expand the Administration tray. Now click on the Config Migration Admin folder  at the bottom of the tree as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 217 ]   Migrating Configuration  Here's how you export configuration into a configuration bundle:   	 First, you need to create a Configuration Template. Click on the Configuration   Templates link on the left. Then pick Create New Template from the  Actions dropdown on the top right  see the following screenshot .   	 The Define Template screen comes up. Click on the Content Server Sections   link in the bottom left.    	 The Content Server Sections screen comes up  see the following screenshot .   It has a list of all configuration, metadata, and customizations that you can  export—the Child Sections table lower in the page:  [ 218 ]   Chapter 9  You can also change values in the Action Options section:   	 Continue On Error: This forces the export or import to continue—even if    	 Email Results: This mails results to the user who initiated the export or   an error is encountered.  import.   	 Add Dependencies or  Ignore Dependencies: This controls whether the   dependencies are added to the export or import bundle.   	 Use Custom Output Bundle Filename: Allows you to change the file name   that will be used to store your configuration bundle.  Now take a look at the following Child Sections table. Notice the zeros in the Items  column. It indicates that your template still has no configuration settings selected.  You can now add all configuration settings to your template or cherry-pick just the  ones you want to export.  1.  Select Actions  Select All. Notice the numbers in the Items column  now reflect your selection. Pick Actions  Save to save your selection.  You will be prompted to give your template a name and description    see the following screenshot :  2.  Your template now has all of configuration settings in your Content Server.   [ 219 ]   Migrating Configuration  3.  Let me show you how you pick just the ones you want. Select Actions    Unselect All.  Select Metadata and place a checkmark next to the xVendor  field that we created in Chapter 3, Metadata  see the following screenshot :  4.  Pick Actions  Save. You're now ready to export your settings into a   configuration bundle.   5.  Pick Actions  Preview to see exactly what settings will be exported    see the following screenshot .  [ 220 ]   Chapter 9  6.  Select Actions  Export. The export operation begins. It may take a while.   The screen will refresh at the interval you specify in the dropdown at the top  right  see the following screenshot . Or, if you're impatient, you can always  click on the Refresh link on the top right, just beneath the Quick Search box.   [ 221 ]   Migrating Configuration  7.  The last thing left to do is to grab the actual bundle file, so we can copy and   import it in our target Content Server instance. Go to the Configuration  Bundles page  see the following screenshot . Click on the actions icon,  next  to the bundle you want. Pick Download.  Perfect. Now let's see how we can upload the bundle on our target instance.  Importing a configuration bundle Importing is the easy part. Follow these steps:  1.  Pick Upload Bundle under Config Migration Admin. The Upload   Configuration Bundle screen displays  see the following screenshot :  2.  Pick the ZIP file of the bundle that you'll be uploading. Check the Force   overwrite box if you want your bundle to replace an existing bundle  with the same name.   3.  Click on the Upload button. The bundle appears in the list on the   Configuration Bundles page.   [ 222 ]   You can now preview and import the bundle. If you like, you can change some  settings such as setting Overwrite Duplicates to True. Select Actions  Edit and  change the options before you select Action  Import. That's all. Pretty easy, isn't it? But what if something goes wrong when you export or  import? How do you find out why it failed? I'll give you a hand in the next section.  Chapter 9  Troubleshooting configuration migration You can see exactly what went wrong. Here's how:  1.  Expand the Administration tray on the left and click on System Audit   Information. In the Active Sections dropdown under Tracing Sections Information,  pick cmu. Note that section names are not sorted by alphabet!  See the  following screenshot.   2.   3.  Click on Update and then repeat the import or export operation that   produced an error.  [ 223 ]   Migrating Configuration  4.  Bring up Admin Server  see Chapter 2, Major Controls, if you need a refresher    and go to View Server Output. Notice that everything CMU was doing is  now logged for you—step by step  see the following screenshot .  If you see any error messages in the server output, you will find them pretty   self-explanatory and easy to fix. Many times, the error will be due to a missing  metadata field or a duplicate value. In the case of a duplicate, you may choose to   ignore the error by setting the "Continue on Error" flag. In the case of missing  metadata field—you can create it and re-run the import—or, better yet, update your  export bundle to include the missing field.  That's great. Now, that you know how to migrate your configuration settings and  your customizations, let's look at archiving your folders.  How to migrate folder structures When it comes to migrating folders, you have two options: Migrating all folders in  one shot or selectively migrating a subset of folders. Let's check out both options:  Migrating all folders in one shot The big advantage of this approach is simplicity. You just export your entire  folder structure with literally one click of a button into a simple HDA file. And   then you can import it on the target system with just one more click. But it has   its own limitations:  [ 224 ]   Chapter 9   	  	  It doesn't migrate your content, just the folders themselves. It erases all folders in your system and then creates the ones from the   import file.  It's great if you need to migrate a copy of your entire folder structure over to a new  instance. Here's how to do it:  1.  Expand the Administration tray. Click on Folder Configuration.  2.  Click on the Export Archive button. This will export your complete folder   structure as a single HDA file and place it in the location of your choice    see the following screenshot :  3.  To import it go to the Folder Configuration page on the target system,   click on Browse to locate your folders HDA file. Then click on the Import  Archive button.  I told you, it would be simple.  [ 225 ]   Migrating Configuration  How to migrate only the folders and content  you select Yes, you can archive and migrate just a select set of folders—including their content.  Here's how.  You'll need to install an optional  but free and included with your Content Server   Folder Structure Archive Component.  Let's go ahead with this simple installation:  1.  Go to the extras directory in the main Content Server ZIP file  a   file like ContentServer_Windows_10gR3_20080807.zip  and grab  FolderStructureArchive.zip.  2.  Launch Component Manager and install FolderStructureArchive.zip.  If you need a refresher on how to install a Content Server component, go  back to Chapter 6, Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV.  3.  Restart Content Server. Close and reopen your browser. Log in to    Content Server.  That's all. You should now have a Folder Archive Configuration link under the  Administration tray  see the following screenshot .  Here's how to archive and migrate selected folders:  1.  Click on the Folder Archive Configuration link. You'll see the Folder Archive   page loading in the right pane.  See the following screenshot.   [ 226 ]   Chapter 9  2.  Pick the Archiver Collection Name. If you didn't create additional   collections, you'll only have one collection in the dropdown. The Folder  Archive component uses Archiver and this is the collection where your  archive will reside.  3.  Select an Archive Name or type in a name for the new archive you want   created. Do this first!  Don't try selecting folders before you pick or type in  your archive name. Your selection will be lost when you change anything in  this field.   4.  Now you can go ahead and pick the folders you'd like to archive. 5.  Click on the Add button when you're done.  And you can always update an existing folder archive. See the following screenshot:  Your archive is now created and ready to export. Launch an Archiver and export it   see Chapter 8, Backup, Restore, and Content Migration, if you need a refresher on how  to use an Archiver .  That's great. And before we close, let's test how the Folder Archive component works:  It's best if you do this on your "sandbox" system where you can afford to lose data  and you have a small number of content items.  [ 227 ]   Migrating Configuration  1.  Create a new folder archive and only export a section of your    folder structure.  2.  Export the archive. Make sure the export operation is finished by looking    at the status bar in Archiver.  3.  Delete a folder or a subfolder within your selection and some other folder  outside your selection that you can afford to lose.  See the next screenshot.   I'm going to delete Accounting and Manufacturing.  Make sure none of the content is in the workflow or you  won't be able to delete the folders.  When you delete them also delete them from Trash! The  regular delete operation just moves them there and is not  really deleting anything!  4.  Launch Archiver and Import the archive you've just created  see the   following screenshot :  [ 228 ]   Chapter 9  5.  Refresh the left pane  or close and reopen your browser . Notice that the   folders that you've archived are now restored in their original location. And  folders that you haven't selected for archiving are now gone! My Accenting  folder is back, but my Manufacturing one is gone for good.   That's all for the Folder Structure Archive component. Now you have the power to  pick and choose what folders you want to migrate.   Summary Congratulations! You now have a complete picture of all the options for backup,  restore, and content migration. You've just seen the last two bits you were missing— how to migrate your configuration and your Content Server customizations to  another instance, and how to migrate folder structures.  You've also seen the two options you have for migrating them—simple full-structure  migration and more comprehensive, selective migration with the optional Folder  Archive component.   This chapter completed our study of backup, restore, and content migration.   Think of the power I've just given you:   	 You now can easily build a system prototype, migrate content in there,    and then clone it—completely or in part.   	 You can easily create additional servers when needed—for increased   capacity and failover.  [ 229 ]   Migrating Configuration   	 You can migrate and refine content, and test your migration—without   affecting production—and, when ready, promote all of your new content   and configuration to production in one fell swoop. In short, you can now promote your content, configuration, and  customizations between your environments—Development, Staging, and  Production.   	   	 You can also create sandbox environments whenever you need to test your   customizations, dry-run upgrading to a new version of UCM, or simply play  with the content of configuration—without worrying about affecting others.  All of these are important real-world applications of what you've just learned,   and this knowledge can save you days, weeks, and even months of rework   and frustration.  In the next chapter I'll give you a taste of what you can accomplish with Content  Server customization. And here's a quick tip—you can customize everything!  [ 230 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  In the previous chapter you learned how to migrate content and configuration. Now,  that you're ready to open the floodgate of your UCM let's see how you can customize  it and integrate into your overall Enterprise Architecture. You'll need some development  background in Web Development, Java or .NET, and or scripting languages to customize  Oracle UCM.  Unlike all the previous chapters though, this one has a different purpose. I'm not trying  to teach you how to customize and integrate Oracle UCM in an hour or two. It just  won't be possible but what I can do well here is give you a few pointers and insider tips  that will save you hours and days down the road. Here's what you'll learn:   	 How to smoothly integrate Oracle UCM into your enterprise—to wipe  out dreaded manual double data entry and multiple "source of truth"  repositories.   	 How to customize the Content Server interface by tapping into its    powerful scripting and Dynamic Server Page resources.   	 How to maximize the value you get from a UCM consulting vendor,   reduce your risk and avoid severe penalties to your budget, timeline,   and your system functionality.   	 How to boost your efforts with the steady flow of inside information    directly from Oracle. Most people miss out on this absolutely free,   project-accelerating consulting time, available to all UCM clients.   	 The tools you have available to alter Content Server behavior and    time-saving pointers on how to use them.  I'll be referring you to a lot of documentation. And I've seen how a great majority  of people get discouraged and intimidated when put in front of a pile of 300-page  manuals, if you too feel that you can use some help—check out the following section.   Customizing Oracle UCM  Documentation and support—the  unexpected treasures Oracle has provided us with very detailed and complete documentation. A lot  of documentation! Maybe that's why most people are failing to use it to its full  potential. The next section will help you get the most out of Oracle documentation,  and save you hours of frustration when looking for stuff.  How to find what you need in ninety   300-page manuals—in three minutes or less If you know the answer, feel free to skip to the next section, but if you're not  sure—this will save you many hours of frustration.  At the time of this writing, there are over 90 manuals posted on the central Oracle  UCM Documentation Library.  Once again, here's how to get to the UCM  Documentation Library: simply Google for "oracle  ucm documentation".  Most of the time, you have to find what you need really fast. But if you'd try to read  any of the manuals—it will take you days to get a simple question answered. You  have to speed-read.  Nope. I'm not insisting that you take Evelyn Wood's course right now, even though,  it might actually help. I'm just asking you to become very selective and skeptical  when you read documentation. Here're a few practical tips that will let you find  information in Oracle UCM documentation library faster than ever before:   	 First of all, I personally prefer to read my manuals in PDF rather than linked  HTML pages  both options are available for most of the guides . This helps  me see  and search  the entire document and I can be sure that I haven't missed  anything on the subject at hand. If you find yourself reading some PDF documents over and over again, you  may choose to save them locally and not wait for them to load off the net  when you need them.   	  [ 232 ]   Chapter 10   	 Every one of these online guides comes with a section called About This  Guide and or Overview. They're just a few paragraphs long at the most.  I know, it sounds obvious, but read them first. A lot of times, you'll either  realize that you're reading the wrong document or you'll see the purpose   and the main features of the tool.   	 Read the entire Table of Content  TOC . You may notice several sections   conveying similar information like a chapter on Installation and a paragraph  with Simple Installation Procedures. In many cases, that paragraph is all  you need!   	 Mark the sections you'd like to read while scanning the TOC. Resist the   temptation to jump into them until you've seen all of the TOC. There might  be a faster way to learn the same thing later in the document.   	 Flip through the pages you're about to read first. This will give you a better   sense of what you're going to read. You'll look at the screenshots and  illustrations more often than not—it will let you skip a lot of pages when you  actually do read the section.  Plan your reading diligently and be smart about it. Unless you truly enjoy reading  documentation, there's a massive amount of time to be saved here.  Now what if documentation doesn't answer your question? Do you have to shell out  a few thousand bucks and bring in a consultant?   Not necessarily! Even though, you might be the only person on the project, if you  have at least one Oracle UCM Support license, you are not on your own.  How to get free consulting from Oracle Yep. You read it right. Oracle is happy to help out. They'd spend hours on the phone  and e-Conference helping you troubleshoot issues and addressing your product  concerns. This book's Technical Reviewer, Billy Cripe, and I can personally attest to  how good and diligent the UCM support team is at Oracle. They have many years of  experience, are very willing to help out, and are good at what they do.  If you ever suspect that any of the UCM products are not doing exactly what you  think they should—don't "be a hero" trying to fix it on your own. Log a support  ticket and let a pro from Oracle help you out for free.  How? It's actually quite simple. Just browse to: https:  support.oracle.com,  register and log a ticket.  [ 233 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  The application is easy to use and it comes with step-by-step guidance  see the  following screenshot :  Perfect. It's off my shoulders now. It's really important that you follow these  guidelines. You see, if you're stuck on a technical issue, it's easy to ask for assistance.  You know exactly what to ask or search for. But if you end up not using the right tool or product feature because you missed it  in a document—that may really turn into something scary for your project and your  organization. Now you have the tools to never let that happen.  With that in mind, let's jump back into customization and integration.  Integrating UCM into larger architectures Imagine that you need to store a vendor invoice in Content Server. The transaction  itself is entered in your Vendor Management ERP system and you're trying to avoid  making your procurement staff enter data in two places. And, of course, you'll need  to be able to get that invoice document out of Content Server from within the ERP,  should they decide to view or print it. What are your choices?  The first one I'd consider is SOAP Web Service, which we will discuss in the   next section.  [ 234 ]   Chapter 10  SOAP web services As we've seen in Chapter 8, Backup, Restore, and Content Migration, the Content Server  itself is a completely Service-Oriented Architecture  SOA  system, where each  action the server takes is a discreet service call. And each of these calls can be done  remotely, assuming you have the correct permissions and authorization, or chained  together. This makes it extremely powerful and easy to integrate.  Let's review a couple of definitions before we proceed: Simple Object Access Protocol  SOAP  is one of the most popular standards for  calling remote services over the Web. It uses XML to encode data. Almost every  major programming language and development environment such as MS .NET and  Java supports it. Many offer wizards that generate all supporting code and let you  call remote services as easy as if they were local and running on the same machine. Web Services Definition Language or WSDL is another XML-based protocol that  lets you define the services, methods you call, their return values and parameters.  Web Services wizards use WSDL file to generate a wrapper class—a block of code  that actually lets you call remote services as if they were local. Content Server comes with a WSDL Generator component—a tool that lets you  generate a WSDL file for any of the Content Server services. This makes all of the  functions of the UCM available to be called remotely via the SOAP protocol.  You don't have to use it, but it's a really helpful tool.  How do you get started with using SOAP? The fastest way I know is to start  with a working sample. WSDL Generator comes with a ton of step by step, well  documented samples.  [ 235 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  On your Content Server file system go to \oracle\ucm\server\custom\ WsdlGenerator\samples  see the following screenshot :  If you don't see WsdlGenerator directory under custom you may want to grab WSDL  Generator component  WSDLGenerator.zip, located in packages allplatform inside  the main Content Server distribution .zip file  and install it using the Component Manager.  You'll see a variety of samples in several programming languages—for most of the  core Content Server services, like check-in and check-out, downloading files, getting  content info, and others.  Now what if you need another way of calling the services that runs faster than SOAP  and hides the details of Content Server service calls? I'll give you an answer in the  next section.  [ 236 ]   Chapter 10  Content integration suite and remote intraDoc  client It's a Java toolset that can be deployed on a number of J2EE application servers. You  can also use Content Integration Suite  the CIS  from a standalone Java application. The biggest benefit of the CIS is that it has its own high-level API, Universal Content  and Process Management API  UCPM API  which, in turn, uses the Content  Server API. This allows developers to focus on the task at hand, instead of getting  concerned with the mechanics of calling individual low level Content Server services.  Believe me, it can get pretty involved.  If the application that you're using to communicate with the UCM is written in  Java, I suggest that you start by evaluating the CIS. It's free and well documented.  To get started, scan the CIS Administration Guide in Oracle Universal Content  Management Documentation library. And if you're considering the CIS, you should actually start by looking at newer  just  over a year old at the time of this writing  Remote IntraDoc Client API  RIDC API .  Just like the CIS, it designed to allow remove Java application to interact with the  UCM, but it's a lot smaller and more intuitive to use.  It also doesn't wrap the UCM services as Java classes so you can easily call any  service you like—including new and custom services. For example, the following  code snippet shows the CIS code to get document info by the dID:  ISCSDocumentInformationAPI documentInfoAPI = m_cisApplication.getUCPMAPI   .getActiveAPI    .getDocumentInformationAPI   ;     create the document ID ISCSDocumentID documentID =  ISCSDocumentID  m_cisApplication.getUCPMAPI   . createObject  ISCSDocumentID.class ;  documentID.setDocumentID "12345" ;  ISCSDocumentInformationResponse docResponse = documentInfoAPI.getDocumentInformationByID m_context, documentID ;  And here's the corresponding RIDC API call:     create and initialize data binder object DataBinder binder = client.createBinder  ;  binder.putLocal "IdcService","DOC_INFO" ; binder.putLocal "dID","12345" ;     Make the service call  [ 237 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  ServiceResponse response = client.sendRequest new  IdcContext "sysadmin" , binder ;  It's easier to understand, more flexible, and a lot more intuitive. Notice that the   names of the classes are a quite a bit shorter too.  And let me also show you a really simple and elegant way of including editable Site  Studio content into any of your web applications  if you're new to Site Studio and  Web Content Management, you may want to skip this section and come back to it  after reading the next chapter .  Consuming site studio content in third-party  web applications Imagine that you have an enterprise portal built with some third-party software such  as WebSphere Portal or Liferay, and you want to include your Site Studio-managed  content. There is a really easy way to do this—just use the following code to include  a contributor data file, rendered in a specified region template:  <iframe src=" http:  stellentdev idc idcplg?IdcService=WCM_ PLACEHOLDER&dataFileDocName= TEST_DATAFILE&templateDocName=TPL_TEST_ SITE_EXT">   The content ID of the contributor data file is TEST_DATAFILE and template is TPL_ TEST_SITE_EXT.  The only caveat to using this feature is that it's new in Site  Studio 10g R4, so you will need to upgrade your server-side  component in order to use it. It will not work in 10g R3 and  earlier versions of Site Studio. You will also need to brush up on Placeholders and Region  Templates  These and other new features of Site Studio 10gR4  and upcoming 11g will also be covered in your newsletter. See  Appendix A for subscription information .  I've created a sample HTML file to illustrate this. The screenshot below shows a  rendered Site Studio data file inserted into an existing sample html page:  [ 238 ]   Chapter 10     And here's how to include the "edit" link:  <a href="http:  stellentdev idc idcplg?IdcService=WCM_BEGIN_EDIT_ SESSION&dDocName=TEST_DATAFILE">Edit content   [ 239 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  This link brings up your familiar Site Studio Contributor application as shown in   the following screenshot:  That's it. Simple and intuitive! For more information, Google for "WCM_PLACEHOLDER" and "WCM_BEGIN_ EDIT_SESSION" services or else get this Oracle whitepaper called External  Application Options  available at http:  www.oracle.com technology  products content-management ucm sitestudio10gr4tutorials  UsingSiteStudioInExternalApplications.pdf .  So those were your main choices for integrating with the UCM. Well, what   about customizing the Content Server itself? How do you alter its interface   or functionality? The next section tells you how.  [ 240 ]   Chapter 10  Customizing the content server When it comes to customizing the Content Server you really have the oceans  of options in front of you. Almost any customization you can imagine you can  implement with the tools and techniques I'm giving you in this section. Let us   start with a few real-life examples.  Examples of common customizations The most common customization I've seen is the need to apply some custom  processing after check in. You may need to do things like applying new metadata  values based on the item's location in your folder structure, or simply customizing   its content ID based on the new value of content type.  Applying custom logic after check-in Take a look at this snippet of java code. This is all the code it takes to write a custom  component for temporary changing the value of AutoNumberPrefix Content Server  configuration variable, based on the content type of the document you're just about  to check in. This lets you generate more meaningful content IDs, like ACC_0247 for  Accounting documents and MKT_0952 for marketing ones:    {      throws DataException, ServiceException  public int doFilter Workspace ws, DataBinder binder,    String type = binder.getLocal "dDocType" ; String prefix = binder.getEnvironmentValue type + "_   public class CheckinFilter implements FilterImplementor {                          ExecutionContext cxt                                                               prefix" ;                 }  if  prefix != null  {   }  binder.putLocal "AutoNumberPrefix", prefix ;  return CONTINUE;                }  You can easily inject your custom java code exactly where you need it, get and  update your metadata values, and run any custom pre- or post-processing. You   will find out more about the custom java components later in this chapter.  [ 241 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  And now let's go a full circle and look at some really simple customization.  Sending custom e-mails from Content Server Let's say, you want your users to fill in a feedback from on your site and you want  that to generate a nicely formatted e-mail to your customer service department. You tried   and it doesn't  produce a nice looking e-mail, plus your e-mail address will be picked up by  spammers.  Simply install the AcmeMail component, that comes with the HowTo Components   discussed later in this chapter  and use this line in your server page to send your  email:    And you can use can use the following line to get the values that your correspondent  has typed in:     It retrieves the value they typed into your   and places it  into your iDoc script variable named fName.  And again, I'll tell you more about using dynamic server pages later in this chapter.  But what if you need to create say, a completely custom user experience and change  the way your users interact with the Content Server?  Creating completely custom user experiences This sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it? But it may be much easier than it sounds.  Simply create a Site Studio website and build your custom interface. Dynamic List  fragments will let you display the results of the Content Server queries and you can  continue to use iDoc to retrieve the values of metadata fields and user input  I'll  introduce you to Site Studio and Web Content Management in the next chapter .  And who said you have to rebuild everything from scratch? You can use the chunks  of existing Content Server user interface and simply plug it in where appropriate.  For instance, using these four dynamic html includes let you apply the standard  Content Server look and feel to any of your custom pages. Place   in the HEAD of your page,    in the BODY and simply wrap your content in <$include  std_page_begin$> and  .  [ 242 ]   And here're the "before" and "after" pictures:  This screenshot shows you a simple one-liner HCST page:  Chapter 10  And here's how it looks after inserting the includes:  When it comes to customizing the Content Server, no resource comes close to The  Definitive Guide to Stellent Content Server Development by Brian "Bex" Huff. Even  though, it's slightly outdated  one version behind 10g R3 , most of the content is still  valid, so, if you need more guidance and information on any of the Content Server  customizations we talk about here I recommend that you get that book  at least a free  preview version from Google Books  and study it.  That said; let's look at your options for customizing the Content Server. Essentially,  there are two things you can customize—functionality and look, and feel. Sometimes  you'll need to do both. Let's start with customizing the functionality.  [ 243 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  Customizing functionality If you need to add a specific scenario when users get a temporary "boost" of their  permissions or you need some scheduled checks performed on your content every  night—you're looking at customizing functionality. But don't fire up your Java IDE  just yet!  In many cases, you can save yourself a lot of work by simply using configuration  instead of customization. If you need someone notified when a special type of  document is checked in—consider creating a criteria workflow instead  See Chapter 5,  Understanding Workflows, if you need a refresher . And if you need to show, hide, or  alter meta values, consider using Profiles and Dependent Choice Lists  explained in  Chapter 3, Metadata .  There's also a bigger benefit in avoiding the actual customization.  Your custom code may stop working when a new version of the  UCM is released and you'll be forced to rewrite it.  Alright! You're sure that you can't accomplish it with profiles and the workflows.  You're then looking at developing custom server components.  Content server components In fact, you can think of the Content Server itself as a framework for running  components. Most of the UCM modules such as Web Content Management,   Records Management, the Dynamic Converter, and Virtual Folders, all are  implemented as custom components. Components are also a great way to   customize the core look and feel. Here's a quick way to get started. Begin by scanning the Working with Content  Components guide. It will help you understand the inner workings and how to use  the Component Wizard to create and deploy skeletons for your new components. Once again, you can enable and disable, install, uninstall, and download ZIP  files from Component Manager page of Admin Server as shown in the following  screenshot:  [ 244 ]   Chapter 10  After you get an idea how to use Component Wizard, I suggest you understand the  types of components you can create and look at some code samples. Let's see what's  involved. Creating content server components with Java First, let's get the code samples and developer documentation. Try downloading  them from: http:  www.oracle.com technology products content- management ucm samples. If the page has moved, just Google for "Sample  Components for Universal Content Management".  Download HowTo Components Sample  also works with Content Server 7.5.2 .  [ 245 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  It's a tutorial that contains several advanced Java components for the Content Server,  as well as documentation of common UCM Java classes. It shows you how to hook  into the internal Content Server Java API and call custom Java code in response to  the server events.  Below are the five primary methods for adding custom Java code  the first two are  my favorites :   	 Service Handlers allow you to create custom Content Server services and   piggy-back on existing services.   	 Filters are event handlers. You can intercept an event such as New Check In   and Update Content Info and have your custom code executed then.   	 Service Classes allow you to create your own Content Server services. They    	  can then be called form the server pages or client applications just like the  standard ones. iDoc Script Extensions let you add new iDoc Script functions. These  functions will be available everywhere you can use iDoc—dynamic pages,  profiles, and workflows.   	 Class Aliasing is the most intrusive. It allows you to extend the functionality  of the Content Server classes, for instance, when you need to call a filter and  no event hook is defined for the event you need to handle.  Look at the samples that come in ZIP file. Be sure not to miss the main  readme.htm file that has important information on Java components  see the  following screenshot :  [ 246 ]   Chapter 10  Anything similar to what you're trying to accomplish? Now you ready to fire up  your IDE.  And here's the question most people are asking when getting into Content Server  Java components. How to setup Java IDE for debugging I'll give you a few pointers. Content Server itself is a Java application so all you need  is simply set it up as a main class that the debugger should start in your IDE. You  then add your component's directory to the classpath, set your break points and off  you go. See, It's not as complex as it seems!  Be sure to add Content Server classes to your project's classpath. They reside in  ucm server shared classes server.zip. The main Content Server class that  you want to run is IdcServer.  Make sure you stop the service or shutdown your  regular Content Server process before starting it or you'll have two processes trying  to listen on the same port !  You may need to add more files from that directory if your project doesn't compile.  [ 247 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  And I suggest that you always do your coding on a virtual machine where you can  always undo your changes. For instance, Eclipse has a default config setting of  "scrub output directory" that may delete Content Server class files and corrupt your  installation. You yourself may accidentally delete or overwrite stuff. Better be safe  than sorry.  If you're using Eclipse, The Definitive Guide to Stellent Content  Server Development book I recommended in the beginning  of the section, has a step by step guide on setting up the  debugging on page 203.  Now you should have a good feel of how to get started with developing custom  Content Server functionality, but what about the presentation layer? Let's see   what's involved.  Customizing interface When it comes to customizing Content Server interface, you have four types of  customizations to pick from:   	 You can modify the skin and layout for search results, left navigation, the   logo, color scheme, and so on. This is useful if all you're trying to do is   apply branding on the Content Server interface or make style adjustments.   	 You can develop custom dynamic pages that access Content Server   functionality. This is exactly what you will be using if you're going to deploy  Web Content Management  see next chapter for introduction to the WCM .   	 You can create a Web Content Management site with Site Studio  covered in   the next chapter .   	 You can use a third-party application as your frontend and surface   UCM capabilities in that application as appropriate  for example, Siebel,  PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, Portal, or Web Applications .  A lot of people confuse the Content Server user interface with UCM  functionality. UCM is a powerhouse of services and reusable components,  while the Content Server UI is just a skin placed on top of a few most  common of those service calls, just the tip of the iceberg, take another look  at Services Reference Guide on the Content Server documentation page. If you think about it that way, then your user experience can be easily  changed per the needs of your users.  [ 248 ]   Chapter 10  OK. Now that I've mentioned all the ways for customizing user interface, let's start  with creating dynamic pages.  Dynamic pages Here's another vast subject that would easily fill a few chapters on its own. So you  can use a good "map" to help you avoid major mistakes and save a lot of hours.  Let's explore the types of pages out there are and what they can do. You can find the  rest of the details in Dynamic Server Pages Guide in Oracle UCM Documentation  Library.  Before we dive into the different types of dynamic Content Server pages, let me show  you the best part of all of them—they are managed content items. You can check them  in and out and version them just like any other document. This means that they are  highly portable, have full "source code version control" built in, can go through the  workflow, have metadata, security and content policies applied to them and so on.  Let's start by looking at the most common dynamic page type: HCST. HCST Hypertext Content Server Template  HCST  pages are very much alike traditional  ASP and JSP pages. They use the same structure as the GUI templates used by  Content Server itself. HCSTs allow you to call iDoc Script functions, get values of  the variables and execute Content Server services. You can create custom check-in  screens and search pages and dynamically display content. HCSTs are widely used  in Web Content Management where you use them to create page templates.  Here's an example of a simple page that displays name, user name, and security  information of currently logged in user using iDoc Script variables:            Hello      Your login name is  ,  your roles are    and your accounts are    And here's how to test it:  Content Server.  1.  Save the code above into a file with .hcst extension. Check it into the   [ 249 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  2.  Go to its Content Information page and click on the Web Location link. 3.  Voila! The page displays, just as expected as shown in the    following screenshot:  Remember me saying that HCSTs are a bit like JSPs? Actually, Content Server lets  you use them too. Here's how to use JSP. JSP Java Server Pages or JSP is also supported. You can use them to access content and  iDoc Script features. It may come really handy if you have existing JSP code and you  just need to blend in some UCM features. You can continue using JSF, Struts, Spring,  and similar frameworks as well as JSP Tag Libraries. Or you can simply use JSP if  you feel more comfortable with them and would rather not code in iDoc.  UCM has an embedded Tomcat application server where you can deploy your  WARs, and servlets.  The only caveat is that JSP support is not enabled by default so you need to turn it  on. Here's how to do it:  1.  Expand Administration tray and go to Admin Server page. 2.  Click on General Configuration on the left. General Configuration screen   comes up as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 250 ]   Chapter 10  3.  Place a checkmark next to Enable Java Server Pages  JSP . 4.   In the JSP Enabled Groups type up the comma-separated list of Security  Groups that you will use to check in JSP pages. You can use the groups  you already defined or create new one, it's a common approach to create a  separate group just for running JSPs.  Restart the Content Server. Now you are ready to check in JSP pages and they   will render, just like you did with HCST.  Be sure to check them into a JSP-enabled  Security Group !  Let's continue with our example:  1.  Save the following listing as a new .jsp file and check it in:     [ 251 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM    <%   sb.init request ;   String user = sb.evalIdcScp "UserFullName" ;   String login = sb.evalIdcScp "UserName" ;   String roles = sb.evalIdcScp "UserRoles" ;   String accounts = sb.evalIdcScp "UserAccounts" ; %>            Hello      Your login name is  ,  your roles are    and your accounts are    2.  Go to the Content Info screen and click on Web Location link to   run it. I've opened the Web Location link in a new tab as shown in  the following screenshot:  Note that you use the idcserver.ServerBean object to execute Content Server  services. It has methods for performing requests, looping over the results and  executing iDoc Script. You can also bundle a bunch of JSPs and Servlets into a single WAR file, and deploy  to the Content Server.  What about iDoc? Do you always have to embed it inside the HCST or JSP pages?  Nope. You can separate it out into its own iDoc files.  [ 252 ]   iDoc files While iDoc files cannot be rendered on they own, they are frequently used as include  files for other types of dynamic server pages. This helps enforce the traditional best  practice of separation of logic  iDoc Script  and presentation  HCST .  This is especially useful in HCSPs and HCSFs—the last two types of dynamic pages  out there.  Chapter 10  HCSP and HCSF These pages are very similar to HCSTs that we looked at earlier in this chapter. Both  HCSP  Hypertext Content Server Page  and HCST  Hypertext Content Server  Form  are combination of HTML and iDoc Script and both can do the same things  that HCST pages can. The difference is that they are fully XML—compliant and there  for use XML iDoc Script, which is iDoc, embedded in HTML comments. The code to  echo the username will now look like this:     Below is a fragment of Site Studio HCSP page template that inserts a copy of the  TestCo_Copywrite fragment at the end of every page:        <!--$ssFragmentInstanceId="fragment2", ssIncludeXml "lib_TestCo_ Fragments", "fragments fragment[@id='TestCo_Copywrite'] snippets  snippet[@id='1'] text  " -->        HCSF pages are used to create web forms that users can fill in for surveys and other  business applications. When user submits an HCSF form, Content Server creates a  copy of the page in a new HCSP page with response values embedded in XML.  You don't have to create your HCSFs from scratch. The following section tells you  about Using Web Form Editor.  [ 253 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM Using web form editor Web Form Editor is a free optional visual design environment for creating web  forms. Once again, authoring web forms can fill a mini-chapter, so all I'm going to  give you is a quick guide to help you hit the ground running. Latest versions of Content Server come with the Form Editor component bundled  in, but if you're using an older version, you'll have to download and install the Form  Editor. It's easy to check if you have it. Expand Content Management tray and see whether Web Form Editor link is present  as shown in the following screenshot:  If you don't have it here's how to install the Web Forms Editor:  1.  Download the latest Content Server ZIP file—see Chapter 1, Getting Up   and Running, if you need a refresher. Inside the archive, under packages allplatform extract two files:  FormEditor.zip and FCKEditor.zip. The latter is a lightweight web editor  component used by the FormEditor as shown in the following screenshot:  2.   [ 254 ]   Chapter 10  3.  Browse to Admin Server and load Component Manager. Install and enable   FCKEditor first. Install and enable the FormEditor. Restart the Content Server.  4.   You're now ready to launch the FormEditor. Before you create your first form though, be sure to check out the Web Form Editor  Guide a comprehensive manual that will get you started with HCSF forms much  faster. Here's how to find it: On the Content Server file system browse to custom FormEditor—the directory  where FormEditor component is installed. Locate file named something like web_ form_editor_10en.pdf and also check out the readme.doc—a shorter version  of the same document. Earlier in this chapter I've given you a refresher on speed  reading. I bet it will come handy now.  And we're not done yet. The last type of customization we haven't looked at yet is  the Content Server Custom Layout and Skins.  [ 255 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM Custom layouts and skins It's what you use for modifying the Content Server Interface. Let's start by getting a  flavor of what they are:  1.  Click on My Profile link on the top navigation bar. User Profile page loads   as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  Change Layout value to Top Menus and click on Update. You'll notice that   the left navigation has disappeared, and the items that used to display in  trays on the left are now forming the second row menu on the top  see the  following screenshot :  [ 256 ]   Chapter 10  You can modify layouts by simply changing files under weblayout\resources\ layouts\Trays\Oracle  be sure to make a backup first !. For instance, if you replace  the HeaderLogo.gif—you will change the Oracle logo in the top left corner with one  of your own  see the following screenshot :   Be sure you're modifying files in the directory of the layout that you have currently  selected or you won't see your changes !  But you don't even have to do that. Oracle, once again, offers you a helping hand.  You can go to the UCM support website and download a free Create, and Modify  Layout Sample Component. It shows you how to create new layouts to create your  own custom interface.  [ 257 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  Browse to: http:  www.oracle.com technology products content- management ucm samples  or Google for "oracle UCM samples" . Download and  install Create and Modify Layout Sample Component and be sure to check out  modifying_interface_10en.pdf file that comes with it.  And here's the clincher. Customizing Oracle UCM may require a lot of skills and  resources, so many organizations engage consulting help to get them through, and  many get scorched when the projects run longer than promised, cost significantly  more and they're not getting the quality that they expected.  While I can't give you a magic wand that would turn a bad consultant into a good  one, I still can give you a set of guidelines that would help you acquire some "x-ray  vision" and get dramatically better results at the end.  Five ways to maximize results when  working with a UCM vendor As a UCM consultant myself, it used to drive me nuts to see some of my projects  suddenly go under without any prior warning. Certainly, nothing related to quality  of work.  It took me years to figure out, but one day I just realized that the actual industry  standards had to be changed. When everyone is used to consultants charging by hour,  the clients are virtually guaranteed to end up paying more and have their projects run  longer than expected.  See my website at: www.stellentExperts.com consulting for  detailed discussion of exactly why is this happening .  Below are the few simple "secrets" that consistently help our clients get their projects  delivered on time and on budget, and avoid the common IT project pitfalls.  Work out a fixed price project I always get "It can't be this easy" objection when I recommend this but yes, it  can, and you drop all the risk into your vendor's laps. Even if it takes them longer  than anticipated you always end up paying exactly what you initially agreed on. I  personally always take initiative and recommend our clients a fixed price option.  You also can't run out of budget when you know exactly how much it will cost you  before the project is started, and it allows for better project scope control while taking  full advantage of the modular SOA capabilities of the UCM. Your larger project then  is delivered as a sequence of small incremental projects that can naturally fit into  each other.  [ 258 ]   Chapter 10  But what if you don't know exactly what you want? What if you want to try a  few scenarios before you have your business people commit on a specific path of  implementation? How can you make you price fixed then?  A short "discovery" mini-project may be a  good idea It will help you explore a few scenarios, do some prototyping and decide on a best  solution. It will help your vendor better understand your unique requirements, and  come up with a solid estimate. But the key is: make this mini-project fixed-price too!  This will prevent it from running two or three times longer than anticipated. I always  recommend my clients to start with a short initial fixed-priced "discovery" phase.  A planning exercise like that will also help you eliminate the risk of "coding  yourselves into a corner"—when, for example, consultants are doing three fixed  projects with no visibility into the fourth one, that will depend on projects one   and three.  Making the fourth project quick and easy becomes impossible as projects one, two,  and three will have to be reworked to fit in the requirements for project number four.  But if the need for the project four was identified during the discovery phase, a  shared program governance model can be developed to facilitate execution of  our fixed price projects, and have them run in series toward a known and shared  overarching goal.  And here's how to further protect yourself. Even if your vendor agreed to a   fixed-price project—you can still get burned. How?  When your vendor's idea of what a "completed system" should look like is not   the same as yours! So the way to protect you from this is to negotiate specific  completion criteria.  Negotiate specific completion criteria If project plan simply states that "UCM is up and running" is your success  expectation—it's not specific enough and you're at risk. What modules should   be present? What customizations complete? If data migration is in scope—what  fields should be migrated over?  Completion criteria can get fairly complex so you may need some time to verify  the results. And here's where another "industry norm" is set up to make clients  vulnerable.  [ 259 ]   Customizing Oracle UCM  The norm I'm talking about is the conventional 90, 60, or even 15 day guarantees.  This is how long the consultant gives you to verify that all the work was completed  to your satisfaction.  Now what if you find a defect or major omission after this period is complete? You'll  have to pay for fixing it! That's right. You'll have to pay for it again, even though you  already paid for it to be delivered as part of the project.  You need to protect yourself. You need to negotiate longer guarantee.  Negotiate longer guarantee The longer you have to weed out the errors and omissions the better is your chance  that your vendor will fix most of their errors at no cost to you. Of course, the ultimate protection would be the Full Lifetime Guarantee—when  your vendor would fix their errors—no matter when you discover them. I personally  feel that this is the only way the clients should be treated and this is what we at  Stellent Experts offer to all our clients.  Your vendor may not  most vendors won't  agree to give you full lifetime guarantee  so you just have to reduce your risk as much as possible, and negotiate a longer term  with them.  And one last crucially important point is coming your way. It's training. We always  include free staff training in our project plans. But even if your vendor is charging you  for training, I recommend that you don't skimp on training.  Don't skimp on training but don't spend a  fortune either! If you don't train your developers, you'll have to shell out thousands of dollars and  hire consultants. If you don't train your staff people, they won't put their important  documents in UCM. They'll keep them in their e-mail and their shared drives or  they'll put them there, but never update them.  On the other end, when important content is missing or outdated—people are not  excited to search for it. The system then takes a down spiral, turning into scrap metal.  How can this be avoided: With training and education. So why almost everyone still  avoid sending their business users for a meaningful UCM training program?  [ 260 ]   Chapter 10  Because Oracle UCM training could be a massive expense. At $700.00 per person per  day, sending 10 people for a five day course totals a handy sum of $35,000.00! And it  never ends with just one course.  No wonder most managers are having bad feelings about it and skimp on training.  So the lesson here is this—your vendor can include the training into your fixed-price  project. For them the added expense is five days of one senior consultant to conduct  the training. For you, the savings are hundreds of dollars per person per day.  Another great way to reduce your training expenses is to encourage your folks  to attend conferences, read blogs and articles  listed in the Resource Directory in  Appendix B . An even better option, that doesn't require constant effort on your part, is to  subscribe to the UCM-related newsletters  See the end of Appendix A for instructions  on how to get your free Oracle UCM continuing education .  Will this book itself help to reduce your training expenses? Absolutely! Will it  shorten the duration of the training you require? Absolutely! But will it let you get   by without training at all? No, it won't. No book will.  Summary This sure was an unusual chapter. I've given you a complete roadmap of all major  tools and options you have for customizing the Content Server and your UCM.  You've learned how to alter the look and feel, and functionality of UCM, and how to  seamlessly tap into its power from other enterprise applications. Last, but not least,  I've explained how to maximize the value you get from a UCM consulting vendor,  reduce your risk, and avoid severe penalties to your budget, timeline and your  system functionality.  In the next chapter we will look at the second most popular UCM module next to  Document Management, its Web Content Management capability, and I'll walk you  through creation of a simple website, pages, and templates.  [ 261 ]    Web Content Management  and Collaboration  In the previous chapter I've given you a complete roadmap of options and the tools  you have for customizing Oracle UCM. I've explained how to reduce your risk, and  avoid severe penalties to your budget, timeline, and your system functionality— when working with a UCM consulting vendor.  This concludes our review of Oracle Content Server and core Document  Management. You now have a solid foundation and are ready to master any of the  additional UCM modules that we didn't completely cover in this book. You've done  all the hard work. Everything else in UCM such as Records Management  URM  and  Web Content Management  WCM  come as add-on Content Server components.  You understand Content Server and that instantly parachutes you many miles ahead  of the clueless rookies fighting their way through the quicksand of confusion and  documentation.  That said, nearly every single Oracle UCM deployment now includes Web Content  Management and nearly every client I've spoke to in the last several years, were  fascinated with the mojo of Web 2.0 and online collaboration. So I figured that you  might like me to add a chapter about that, and help you to hit the ground running.  So here it comes. I'll guide you through using Web Content Management to create  great websites from installing WCM itself—to planning—to the tools you use to  design the actual site. Hold on to your hat! Will zoom you through over 500 pages   of documentation in a short hour and save you a few more weeks of trial and error.  In this chapter I'll show you:   	 How to install and configure Web Content Management and get you ready    to dive into development of your first UCM website.   Web Content Management and Collaboration   	 Seven website planning steps that will steer you clear from pain and agony of  mid-project redesigns, and wasted weeks of un-necessary content migrations.   	 How to use page templates, fragments, and region content. This will give   you an instant knowledge of WCM site structure and how to get your site up  at record speed.   	 A step by step, easy way of actually creating your first Site Studio website. Insider look at online collaboration tools, features, and products, and how    	 to best get them working for you.  Enough introductions! Let's start by getting ready for the WCM.  Getting ready for Web Content   Management In this section I'll show you how to install Web Content Management on your  Content Server instance, and introduce you to its major components. In fact, there is  only one—the product behind Web Content Management called Site Studio, and it  has four parts to it. So let's begin by looking at these parts one by one.  Introducing Oracle Site Studio Let's look at the parts that make up the Site Studio:   	 Site Studio Content Server Component: This is what extends Content Server   to enable WCM functionality. You need to install Site Studio Component  before you can use WCM  see the next section for installation instructions .   	 Site Studio Designer: This is an integrated development environment  IDE    for building websites. Designer is a Windows application and must run on  the Developer's desktop. We will be using the Designer later in this chapter  to create our first website.   	 Site Studio Contributor: This is a thin-client editor application that runs   in the client's browser. This is what actually allows contributors to manage  content. I'll show you how it looks later on, when we'll be adding content to  your site.   	 Site Studio Manager: This is a limited, browser-based version of Site Studio  Designer. It allows Site Administrators to create new pages and modify site  navigation.  Great! We're now ready to get back to the keyboard. Let's proceed with the  installation.  [ 264 ]   Chapter11  Installing Oracle Site Studio Installing Oracle Site Studio involves three basic steps:  1.  Downloading the WCM components. 2.  Installing Site Studio Content Server. Installing Designer Application. 3.   Let's start with the first step. Downloading WCM Components Just as before, Google for "Download Oracle Universal Content Management".  The page you want must look like this:  Just scroll down to Web Content Management section and download a file named  something like Site Studio 10gR4.  10g R4 is the latest version of Site Studio  – at the time of this writing, and this is the version I'm using to illustrate WCM  functionality .  Once you have the zip file, you're ready to proceed with the installation.  [ 265 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration Installing Site Studio Content Server Component Below are the few simple steps you need to complete:  1.  Launch your Component Manager. Uncheck Hide Standard and System   Components and make sure you have DBSearchContainsOpSupport in  the Enabled Components box. This component is required for Site Studio  to work properly, so if you don't have it in place find it in the ZIP file, that  contains your Content Server distribution and use Component Manager to  install it—before proceeding to the next step  See Chapter 10, Customizing  Oracle UCM, if you need a refresher on installing components .  2.  Unzip the Site Studio main file. Using Component Manger, install a   component, found under component  subdirectory. File name should be  similar to sitestudio9.0.0.470.zip as shown in the following screenshot:  When installing Site Studio 10g R3 you must enable database full  text indexing. See Content Server Installation Guide from the  UCM documentation library for instructions on how to do that. This  is not a requirement for Site Studio 10g R4.  During the install, you will see the Install Settings screen as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 266 ]   Chapter11  It gives you an option to pick different Content Types for different types   of files that make up your websites. This will help you group them by type  and locate easily. Might be well worth your time to click on Cancel, go ahead  and create five content type, and then come back to installing Site Studio  Component  See Chapter 3, Metadata, if you need a refresher on creating the  Content Types .  3.  Enable the component and restart Content Server. 4.  Open Site Studio Installation Guide and scan the Post-Installation Tasks and  Considerations section. Depending on your web server configuration, you  might need to perform additional steps. If running on Windows then restart your IIS. If you forget, you may not be  able to see your Site Studio websites that you will be developing.  5.   That's it! You're now to ready to start building your website, and you'll need Site  Studio Designer on your desktop. So let's now install the Site Studio Designer. Installing Designer application This one is really easy. Just extract and run setup.exe from  Designer directory in  the Site Studio ZIP file. There are no options to pick from and it installs in a flash.  Congratulations! All the pre-work is now behind us and we're ready to create our  first website.  [ 267 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  Creating your website I'm sure you've heard that an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. Indeed,  a solid day or two of planning can save you weeks and even months of frustration,  working around the knots in your site framework. Below is a checklist of what you  should be clear on—before you jump into the implementation:  1.  Your site map where all your pages and links are clearly defined. 2.  Your site layout and HTML templates. For instance, if your homepage looks   different and the rest of the site has the same layout then you will need two  templates—one for the homepage and one for the rest of the site. It may be very helpful to create wireframes—the rough sketches of what  elements make up your pages—for every type of the page that you will need  on the site. I'm also a big fan of using pencil and paper or whiteboard for  those instead of neat looking Visio diagrams and fancy mock-ups. Why? It is quite simple. An impeccable-looking diagram looks, well, perfect. So  when your business client looks at it—they tend to like it—before they even  had a chance to think of the actual page elements that are shown. And the  page layout may not work out in the long run, and all of your planning  efforts will be wasted. On the other hand, a pencil sketch or a white board  drawing bring attention to the subject itself and invite participation. The same goes for the story boards—diagrams that show your common  browsing patterns and typical user behaviors. Creating story boards will help  you structure your content more logically, and can produce massive savings  and productivity gains—when you consider how minutes saved of each site  interaction multiple with each of the thousands people browsing your site.  3.  Your contribution regions clearly marked within your templates. These   are the blocks of content within the page that your users  contributors  can  change directly—without using development tools. If you have a newsflash page, that has your top and your left menu, content  areas for your president's message, your featured story and page footer then  you're looking at two contribution regions—one for your featured news story  and one for your president's message. Your marketing folks should be able to  update those without coding and calling on your development folks. But they  don't need to touch your top and your left menu and your footer.  [ 268 ]   Chapter11  Site Studio 10gR4 adds a few more levels of indirection to give  you even better separation of structure elements and simplify  the reuse. Instead of the contribution regions in the template, it  uses placeholder tags that can contain a sub-template or a region  definition.  See Site Studio Designer Guide v.10gR4 for more  information .  4.  Your dynamic content needs to be identified. Things like RSS feeds,   calendars, dynamic menus, web forms and image galleries. You need to   find everything that's not static HTML and not user-changeable content. One of the most common types of dynamic content in Site Studio driven   websites is simply a result of a Content Server query. Your list of breaking  news can simply be a result of the query for Content Type of a NewsStory  and release date within the last three days  See Chapter 3, Metadata, if you  need a refresher on Content Server queries .  5.  Your reusable fragments. Things such as menus, page footers, and company  logos that appear on more than one page and need to all be changed in just  one place. Fragments may be static  like the logo  or dynamic  like a menu   but they cannot be changed by contributors.  6.  Your naming convention the prefix you give to the Content ID and the Title   of your site elements—templates, fragments and alike. Not only your naming convention is important for grouping your reusable  elements by site, organization unit and alike, and making your code look  logical and consistent, it also helps you separate your site structure from your  site content. Remember, your site structure elements, like your templates and your project  files are also stored in your Content Server—along with the actual content  that goes on your website.  7.  Permissions and metadata—roles, accounts, content types, and custom  metadata that you'll be using on the site structure elements and the site  content.  Wow! Looks like a long list, but believe me, a few days spent planning your site is a  small price to pay for avoiding pain and agony of mid-project redesigns and wasted  weeks of un-necessary content migrations.  The good news is that we're just learning the ropes and you don't have to do all of  this thinking right now. I just wanted you to be aware of these things. Better safe,  than sorry.  [ 269 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  OK. We're now ready to look at the WCM tools. Let me give you a quick primer on  core elements of your website structure.  Understanding site structure elements Let's look at all the files and structures that make up your website in Site Studio:   	 Project File: This is a master XML file that Site Studio is using to store your  site' structure and navigation. It's a glue that holds together your navigation,  your templates, and your content. You can easily spot it in the search results  that it has a Content ID starting with SS_PROJECT_.   	 Fragments: These are reusable blocks of content that cannot be changed by  contributors. Fragments are stored in Fragment Libraries—each containing  an XML file with code for all the fragments and snippets, and a ZIP file with  Fragment Assets—its images, CSS styles, and other files used by fragment's  HTML.   	 Navigation sections: These are thenodes of the site structure  such as Home,   About Us, and Our Products . Each section has a primary page and a page  template for rendering other content inside this section.   	 Page Templates  Layout Files : The dynamic Content Server pages  HCSP,   JSP, or ASP  that are used to render a page—complete with fragments,  contribution regions, elements, and content.   	 Placeholders  introduced in 10gR4 : These are new insertion tags that let you   place a contribution region or sub-template into your page template.  	 Subtemplates  introduced in 10gR4 : These  are reusable mini-page   templates that may have placeholders of they own.   	 Contribution Regions: These are marked areas on the page template that   contain user-changeable content.   	 Elements within a Region: These are individual units of managed content   of the same type. For example, a job title on a job posting site may be a plain  text element. A region can contain multiple elements. Other element types  include rich text, image, static lists, and Content Server query  Dynamic list .  	 Region Templates  introduced in 10gR4 : These are partial HTML files that  let you define the look and feel of the Contribution Region and the Elements.  	 Contributor Data Files: These are XML files that contain user content inside   the Region Elements.   	 Native Documents: A document  such as MS Word, Excel, PDF, or an   AutoCAD drawing  that is placed inside a contribution region. A document  gets dynamically converted to HTML when the page is displayed.  [ 270 ]   Sounds complex? It's actually not. Take a look at the diagram below—it will  help you to "drive home" these terms and how they all fit together. You will see  how Navigation Sections in a Project File linked to page templates, how multiple  templates are used to render different page layouts, and how contribution regions  and elements are used to render managed content:  Chapter11  [ 271 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  What about the placeholders? This diagram shows you the "traditional"  site structure of Site Studio 10gR3 and earlier versions. I've purposely left  out the new levels of indirection, introduced in R4, because I want you to  keep things simple when you're making your first steps. Create your first website using this, much simpler "traditional" model,  that continues to be supported in 10gR4. Once you get comfortable, it's  easy to follow the Site Studio Designer Guide 10gR4 and add these new  powerful features such as the Region Templates and Subtemplates to  your mental framework.  And now it's a perfect time to see all of these in action. Next section is a lab that  walks you through creating a simple website.  Lab 11: Creating a website with Site Studio  Designer Launch your Designer application. The first thing you see when starting  Designer for the first time is Site Connection Manager screen as shown in  the following screenshot:  You're now ready to create your new site.  Creating new site Below are the few simple steps it takes to create a new Site Studio website:  1.  Click on the New button. Site Connection Details dialog displays as shown   in the following screenshot:  [ 272 ]   Chapter11  2.  Type up your Server Cgi URL. If your server name is stellentdev and  your Content Server instance name is idc, your Cgi URL will be: http:   stellentdev idc idcplg.  3.  Click on New button next to Site Label. Create New Site dialog displays as   shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Populate Site ID  the URL name of your website , Name  full, user-friendly   name  and dynamic page Type you're about to use. In most cases, you'd be fine with the default choice, hcsp jsp, in place. The  other choice is to create the site based on Active Server Pages  asp . ASP  sites allow you to reuse your legacy ASP code, but you won't be able to take  advantage of full functionality, architecture, and features introduced in Site  Studio 10gR3 and 10gR4.  Instead of creating an ASP site consider hosting your few hard-to-replace  ASP pages inside an iframe in your full-featured HCSP site.  [ 273 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  5.  Voila! Your site is now created, and full Site Studio Designer interface is   available to you  as shown in the following screenshot :  You're now ready to build your site.  Using Page Templates Right now your site navigation is empty. Let's create your first page:  1.  Right click on the Home node and pick Select Home Page as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 274 ]   Chapter11  2.  Select Page Template dialog displays. Pick Create a new page template    hcsp  and click on OK as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 275 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  3.  Warning dialog displays. When working on a live web site, you'll need to be   aware of the fact that your changes, like adding pages or including them in  navigation, will be instantly reflected and visible to your site's visitors. For  now though, we can simply dismiss the warning  see the screenshot below :  4.  Click on OK to acknowledge the warning. Check In screen will pop up. 5.  Give your template a Title and click on Assign Info to complete Check  In. Your Home Page Template now displays in the site hierarchy pane.  Double-click on the template name to open it in the editor. 6.  Type some text in the page template and select File  Save. 7.  Right-click on your new template and pick View in Browser.   Congratulations! Your site now has its first page and the page is proudly  displaying in a browser as shown in the following screenshot:  8.  You can also go back to familiar Content Server user interface and click on  the Web Sites tray. Your new website will be there and you can click on the  site name to see its homepage  see the following screenshot :  [ 276 ]   Chapter11  That's great. Your first page is now up. But it doesn't really look like a website. Let's  take a next step and add some navigation. The next section shows you how.  Using Fragments Here's a simple way to add top navigation bar to our site.  1.  Move cursor to the top left of the document where the top navigation bar  would go. In the Toolbar pane select Navigation Fragments and click on  Nav Tabs Top  see the following screenshot :  [ 277 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  2.  Fragment Parameter Values dialog displays  see the following screenshot .   Pick values for the text color, background color, and so on.  3.  Click on the PREVIEW tab at the bottom of the main editor window. You can   see navigation tab for Home appear on the top left of your siteas shown in  the following screenshot:  [ 278 ]   Chapter11  Now let's add Copyright note to the bottom of the page. In fact, let's make   it reusable, so any template on any site in our company can use it. And if   we want to add something to our copyright note later on, or change our   company name—we only want to change it one place. How do we do this? By creating our own fragment. The easiest way to get started is to copy an  existing fragment. Here's how to do it:  [ 279 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  4.  Click on Other Fragments in the toolbox pane. Right-click on Copyright   Example and select Copy and Edit… as shown in the following screenshot:  5.  Type fr_TestCo_Copywrite for Content ID  I like to use a prefix in a name   so I can easily distinguish fragments by content ID .  6.  Fragment Editor now displays in the main editor window as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 280 ]   Chapter11  Fragment Editor has two main panes: Snippets pane and Source Code   pane. A fragment can contain multiple snippets—blocks of code that get  added to your template when you add a fragment to it. You can define   multiple snippets that can be inserted inside HTML head element, top, and  bottom of HTML body tag or simply at the drop-point—the point in the  document where your cursor was when you clicked on the fragment in   the toolbox. When you select a snippet, its code is displayed in the Snippet code window  below.  7.  Now you can preview your fragment. Click on the Preview… button at the   bottom of the fragment editor.  8.  And now it's time to save our new fragment. Go to File  Save. Save   Fragment dialog displays  See the following screenshot . Click on New  button to create new fragment library. Let's call it lib_TestCo_Fragments.  And here comes the fun part! Let's change the snippet code. Why don't we  make the copyright year dynamic, so it always has the current year, and we  never have to manually update it? All we need is to use iDoc Script function dateCurrent   and format  its output, so we only see a year. Here's how finished Snippet code will   look like: Copyright &copy;   ,  Test Co Inc.  [ 281 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  9.  Type up the code in the Snippet code window and click on Preview button   at the bottom of the fragment editor window. Voila! Our new dynamic  copyright fragment displays correctly as shown in the following screenshot:  10.  Now move the cursor to the bottom of the page and click on our new Test Co   Copyright fragment to add it to your template.  Perfect! We now have the menu and the footer in place. Seems like a perfect time to  drop in some content.  Adding content Now we'll populate the main area of the page. Let's drop in a region where users can  actually change content:  1.  Switch your template editor to DESIGN tab and move cursor to the place   where you'll be inserting a contribution region. Then click on Insert Region  button on the Contribution Toolbar as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 282 ]   Chapter11  2.  Contribution Region dialog displays. Give your region a name such as   Main_Page_Content  see screenshot below . You can also pick the actions  you'd like to allow contributors to perform on this content region. To continue with this lab, pick the actions exactly as shown below.   Here's why:  	  Contributor edit option allows contributors to launch the   web-based editor and update your content.  	  Document info lets them bring up the Content Information  dialog and see metadata values for your contributor data file. 	  Workflow approve and Workflow reject allows designated   	   approvers to approve and reject changes to content items. Switch region content lets them place another contributor  data file in this contribution region.  I'll tell you more on switching region content—right after the screenshot:  [ 283 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  Switch region content option allows users to pick a different Contributor  Data File or create a new one. This is useful when some of your pages  on  one or more sites  share the same content and you'd like to have just one  place to update it. How would you assign the same content to more than  one page? Browse to the page that you'd like to reuse. When in contributor mode  see later in this chapter on how to get in  contributor mode  pick Document Info and make a note of the Content  ID of contributor data file. Browse to the page where you'd like to see another copy of this content  and pick Switch Region Content. Select Existing From Content Server  and select the Content ID you memorized in Step 1. You now have exactly the same contributor data file assigned to more  than one region and changes in any one of them will affect all the pages  that share it.  3.   If you decide to allow your contributors to switch region content, you can  further customize the behavior by clicking the Define button next to its  check box  see the following screenshot :  That's great. You now have a contribution region defined, but it takes   one more step to let your contributors actually edit the content. You need   to insert one or more elements into your region.  4.  Place your cursor inside the region and click on Add Image Element button   on the Contribution toolbar.  [ 284 ]   5.  Element Definition dialog pops up. Specify the Name  that will show in  your template , Label, and Info  that will show on Contributor interface -  see the following screenshot :  Chapter11  6.  Actions section of the dialog allows you to enable or disable various actions   that contributors can perform from their interface. You can also specify  validation rules, such as acceptable image dimensions for the image element.  7.  Click on OK to continue. 8.  Now add a Plain Text element right after your Image Element.  We've just hit another milestone. You now have a contribution region defined in  your page. Now let's see how it will work from your business user's end.  [ 285 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration Using Contributor interface We're going to view the site from the site's contributor point of view  a contributor  is a user who can change content :  1.  Save your changes. Right-click on your template and pick View in Browser. 2.  When your site comes up, click Ctrl+Shift+F5. It's a key combination to enter   the Contributor Mode. You'll see Oracle Site Studio Contributor Mode  banner over the top of the screen  see the following screenshot .  3.  Click on the popup menu icon  second icon for the region  and pick   Switch Content.  4.  Switch Content dialog comes up as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 286 ]   Chapter11  5.  Pick New Contributor Data File to create a new file that will hold this region   content. Click on Next button below. A familiar check in screen comes up.  Populate the required fields and click on Finish button to complete.  6.  You'll now have the Edit option appear on the Region Popup Menu. Click on  Edit to bring up Site Studio Contributor application and add content to your  region.  7.  Press Ctrl+Shift+F5 once again to get out of contributor mode. Your page   content is now displayed normally  see the following screenshot :  [ 287 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  As you can see, the image is inserted in-line with the text. But what if you prefer to  lay it out in a table, with image and text each occupying their own column?  see the  following screenshot :  [ 288 ]   Chapter11  If you try to insert a table in DESIGN mode and then move your elements inside the  table, you'll get an error message. So how did I do it? Simple! I just inserted the table in the SOURCE view. I found the code that Site  Studio inserted for the region     and so on  and inserted a table inside the region tag, to lay out my contribution  elements.  [ 289 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  Here's what the finished region code looks like:                                                        <!--$ssIncludeXml SS_DATAFILE,region1_element1 &                " node  " -->                                                          <!--$ssIncludeXml SS_DATAFILE,region1_element2 &                  " node  " -->                                             Perfect! And now let's look a little closer at adding new pages.  Adding pages Let me show you the way that you're likely to be using the most often:  1.  Right-click on Home node and select Add Section. New Section Dialog   displays as shown in the following screenshot. Give your new navigation  section a Label and URL:  [ 290 ]   Chapter11  2.  Right-click on the new section and pick Select Primary Page. Select Page   Template dialog displays as shown in the following screenshot:  In step seven above I've shown you how to create a new page template, but we  haven't explored two other options:   	 Select existing page template from the content server: This is your most   common pick, simply because majority of your website's pages will be  sharing a small set of page templates.  [ 291 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration   	 Create a new page template from an existing page: This will be your second   most common choice, since even when you do need a new page template,  you're much better off making a small change to an existing page template,  rather than creating a new template from scratch.  Below we're going to try both of these options. Let's begin with the most   common one:  1.  Pick Select existing page template from the content server, pick the   template we've just created and click on OK.  2.  You're almost done. All that's left to do is include this new section in  navigation. Until then, it will be hidden and will only show up in the  Designer application. Right-click on the new section and pick Include  Section in Navigation  see the following screenshot   3.  Go to Tools  Update Navigation and display your new section in a browser   this is a right-mouse context menu on your section's page template . Notice  that the top menu fragment now has your new section too  see the following  screenshot :  [ 292 ]   Chapter11  4.  And now let's add one more page. This time, let's make a copy and slightly  modify our page template. Right-click on Home node and add another new  section there.  5.  Right-click on this new section and pick Select Primary Page, but this time,   when Select Page Template dialog shows up, pick Create a new page  template from an existing page.  6.  Once you're done creating new page template, double-click on it to open it  for editing. Delete Image and Plain Text elements from your contribution  region, and instead place a WYSIWYG element there  See Adding Content  section above if you need a refresher on adding regions and elements . 7.  Take a moment to study Element Definition screen  see the following   screenshot . It gives you options to enable or disable each individual control  on WYSIWIG Rich Text Editor.  [ 293 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  Notice how much power this gives you, the designer. You can give  people as much or as little control over the look and feel of the site, as you  trust them to have. At the same time, you can still allow them to edit the  content of your page. For instance, if you prefer to control your fonts and styles with the CSS,  you can only allow them to type text, insert links and, maybe, make text  bold. They won't be able to change the font, insert pictures or in some  other way affect the consistency of your look and feel, and your site  accessibility.  8.  Display your new page in a browser. Go into Contributor mode and pick   Assign Content. Create new Contributor data file and then edit the element.  [ 294 ]   9.  Rich Text Editor will come up, letting you to edit and format text, insert links   and pictures, and paste rich text from other applications  see the following  screenshot below :  Chapter11  10.  Once you done editing, click on the save icon on the top of the dialog  right   below the element's content ID . Notice how your rich text content is now  part of the page  see the following screenshot :  [ 295 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration  Congratulations! You've completed the Web Content Management tutorial and now  ready to begin working on a real-life website of your own. WCM is large enough of  a subject to fill up an entire book; so inevitably, you will be bumping onto additional  features and ways to do things that we haven't covered in this quick introduction.  But we did accomplish the most important objective—if you followed the chapters  of this book, you now understand the core WCM structure elements, how they fit  together and how you can use them. With that knowledge under your belt, it will be  easy to pick up the rest of WCM features and techniques.  But don't just believe me. Test for yourself. Get comfortable with this tutorial, then  scan through the Oracle Site Studio Designer Guide and see if any of the features  get you baffled. They won't. You'll be well prepared.  When you done with that, the next topic you might consider checking out is the  Technical Reference Guide for deeper level technical information on Site Studio file  structures and iDoc scripting guide.  And we're not done yet. There's one more important WCM topic that I'd like to   walk you through. I want you to have a solid understanding of Site Studio  Publishing Models.  Understanding the publishing model Your Publishing Model is the framework you choose to have your content  delivered. For instance, if you let your end users  your content consumers  simply  browse your site on the Content Server—you're using Dynamic Publishing Model. And  if they're browsing a static HTML version of your website, you're looking at Static  Publishing. Essentially, there are three publishing models; Static, Dynamic, and the  Native. Let me show you the features and benefits of each.  Static publishing There are cases when it can be highly beneficial to have your site published as static  HTML. Your contributors can work on a site inside your company's firewall and then  have it published onto your public webserver, outside of the firewall. If that public  server gets compromised, the hacker will leave empty-handed. There's nothing there,  but public content. Your protected sensitive content was not published at all and  stayed behind in your Content Server.  There's also another major benefit to this model. Even though a Content Server can  be very fast serving content, nothing beats plain and simple static HTML content  delivery. So that can also be your choice if you deal with very high traffic sites.  [ 296 ]   If you decide to explore Static publishing, you'll need to install and use Oracle Site  Studio Publisher tool. This is a crawler that scans your site for changes as often as  you specify and keeps your static HTML version updated. It can also deliver this  copy to another server for you through FTP and other options.  Chapter11  Site Studio Publisher is being given a big overhaul in soon-to-be-released  v.11g, so be sure to claim your free newsletter subscription, and keep up  to date on this and many other important UCM features, see the Preface  or Appendix A for instructions on how to subscribe.  And now let's look at Native Publishing Model.  Native publishing We briefly touched on Native Publishing in our WCM tutorial. If all you're trying  to do is simply publish a copy of your existing documents on the Web, Native  Publishing can save you a ton of money, rework and frustration. It allows you  to eliminate multiple copies of the same document. There's no need to get your  webmaster to create and maintain HTML copies of your business documents, just so  you can publish them on the Web.  Simply assign your original documents to contribution regions as Native Documents  and have Content Server convert them to HTML on the fly for you.  You'll need  Oracle Dynamic Converter, an add-on you can download as part of Oracle  Document Management bundle .  And now let's take a look at our last  and very popular  publishing model,   Dynamic Publishing.  Dynamic publishing Once again, if you let your site visitors  content consumers  to browse directly off  your Content Server, you're running a Dynamic Publishing model. You then must   be concerned about security and, if your site is public-facing and attracts thousands  of visitors, capacity and performance may also become a concern. Content Server Planning and Implementation Guide shows you multiple deployment  scenarios, that let you come up with the exact Content Server and WCM  configuration to suite your organization's needs.  In my opinion, the most popular Dynamic publishing scenario is the   Contribution-Consumption architecture. Here's how it works.  [ 297 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration Using contribution-consumption architecture Let's say, you website lives in a main Content Server instance, and you need to  dynamically publish it to the world. Instead of exposing your Content Server  and  your sensitive content  to the world, you can use a second Content Server instance   a Consumption Server  that will only have your read—only publically available  content for extranet or public web consumption. Your main Content Server  your  Contribution Server  will have all of your content and will push content onto the  Consumption Server with Archiver Replication. This approach offers a number of  important benefits:   	   	  It allows you to isolate your public-facing Consumption Server and leave  your sensitive content in your Contribution Server behind the firewall. It helps you increase performance by reducing the amount of content  available in your Consumption Server  only a subset of content is published  and only the latest revisions .   	 You can further increase your performance and site capacity by installing a   reverse proxy in front of your consumption server, and using longer max age  values. You may not be able to do this on your contribution server, where  content contributors must always see the changes that they make right away.  So there you have it. You're now aware of the publishing models. And here's the  question that nearly every one of our clients is concerned about: What about Web  2.0?. Features such as RSS Feeds, Blogs, Wiki, Team Calendars, and portlets are now  on every organization's wish list.  So, let's see how you too can use these Web 2.0 features on your project.  Adding online collaboration If you were browsing through fragments in a Designer, looking for RSS feeds, Blogs  and Wikis, you were probably disappointed. They are not there! Why?  Years before online collaboration became main stream; Stellent had a product called  Collaboration Manager  You can still download and install it. It's a Content Server  component . It gives you project workspaces, online discussions and another, more  traditional security model.  But now Oracle offers a new, by far more superior product for all of your online  collaboration needs. The name of the product is Oracle WebCenter. Let's take a  closer look.  [ 298 ]   Chapter11  Using Oracle WebCenter WebCenter is the new Oracle product that's coming in to replace the old  Collaboration Manager. It offers personal and team workspaces, portlets, killer  collaboration features such as blogs, wiki, RSS, and more—all out of the box.  And yes, it has UCM integration built in. So if you need to use online collaboration,  I encourage you to evaluate WebCenter  An evaluation version is available from  Oracle for free download . Even better—WebCenter license may even be included  into your UCM Suite license and it might not cost you an extra dime  Check your  paperwork or contact Oracle Representative to be sure .  But what if all you need is one simple RSS feed or a blog or just one Wiki library and  you're not up to learning a new product just yet? In this case you may consider using  these free UCM sample components.  Finding UCM sample components There is a number of sample Stellent components available for free download.  Below are the three most popular.  RSS feeds This component adds RSS feed support to Content Server searches, workflows  and to Site Studio static and dynamic lists. Component comes with samples and  documentation. To download it Google: "Sample Components for Universal Content  Management", and search for "RSS Feeds".  Then there are blogs and wiki components.  Blogs and wiki components Blogs and Wiki samples were too once provided by Oracle but are no longer  available for download. My guess is that Oracle is trying to encourage people to  use WebCenter product instead. But, like I said before, if you need to add a blog  or a wiki to your site in a hurry, you may consider these samples  both are well  documented . At the time of this writing, Brian  Bex  Huff is still keeping a copy of  them at his site at: http:  bezzotech.com library.  Below are the actual component names and short functionality descriptions from  Brian's site:   	 SampleBlogs Component: A sample Site Studio website that demonstrates   how to add a blog on your page. It includes the CK Editor for quick-post  functionality.  [ 299 ]   Web Content Management and Collaboration   	 SampleWiki Component: A sample Site Studio website that demonstrates  how to create a Wiki  Wiki pages can even be Microsoft Word documents .  Supports some wiki markup, but most styling should be done with the  Site Studio editor. You might also want the Java source, to add more wiki  markup support.  And here's another good excuse to go ahead and try these components—they are  a great way to master Site Studio development even further.  Below is the third popular source of Oracle UCM components.  Fishbowl Oracle UCM Component Repository Fishbowl Solutions maintains a library of reusable UCM components.  Some are free and some are available at nominal costs. Check them out at:   http:  www.fishbowlsolutions.com StellentSolutions.  That's it. We've covered all the bases to give you a running start with the Site Studio  and Web Content Management. All that's left to see is this brief, important recap of  what you've learned.  Summary In this chapter you learned how to build websites with Web Content Management.  You've seen the exact steps to install Site Studio components and how to build your  first website. You've learned about the publishing models and seven forgotten but  blazingly obvious website planning steps that will make your efforts wickedly  effective. We've also surveyed the landscape of Oracle online collaboration tools, and  found the quick shortcuts that can get you up and running in a short afternoon. This concludes our journey. Following this chapter, be sure to review the Appendix A  that gives you the important big picture of entire Oracle UCM product offering, and  your critical next steps that will take you to an even higher level in your Oracle projects  and your own career.  [ 300 ]   Exploring Oracle UCM  Product Offering  We've just finished looking at the Web Content Management and Site Studio suite   of products. In previous chapters we used a lot of tools that help us build,  administer, and manage the Content Server. Did we cover all of the UCM?  Nope. But we learned its foundation and its two most popular modules: Document  Management  ECM  and Web Content Management  WCM . And the chances are— you won't need to learn any other UCM modules. But even if this is the case, you   will still benefit by understanding what other products and modules are included,  and the fastest ways to go about mastering them.  So let's look at all of the products that make up Oracle Universal Content  Management.  UCM product line up Essentially, there are five groups of products. We will look at each one in more  detail, so you will always be sure that you use the right tool for the job at hand.   The first one we should look at is the ECM.   Exploring Oracle UCM Product Offering  Enterprise content management The ECM  also known as Document Management  is a set of tools you'll use to add  full text search, revisions, granular access control, workflow, easy web publishing,  and more to your existing content. Many organizations use it to transition from  paper documents in file cabinets, e-mail, file shares, and other legacy document  management systems. It helps business users find the right documents fast—just  when they need them, and cut down on wasteful paper processes. It also makes their  content more secure and better protected against an accidental loss.  Document Management Group includes the following products:   	 Content Integration APIs: This includes Java toolsets  Custom Components,   CIS, RIDC and so on  for extending ECM functionality and for remote  communication with UCM, and WSDL Generator for using any SOAP-aware  tool to consume UCM services  We looked at these tools in more detail in  Chapter 10, Customizing Oracle UCM .   	 Desktop Integration Suite: This allows you to integrate Virtual Folders with   Windows Desktop and Microsoft Office  We explored the CIS in Chapter 6,  Understanding Virtual Folders and WebDAV .   	 Dynamic Converter: This allows you to convert business documents into  web pages for everyone to see, without the need to use applications that  created them. You can include MS Office, AutoCAD drawings, and hundreds  of other proprietary file formats on your site—and never worry about your  end users needing to have an appropriate viewer on their machines to open  them. Dynamic Converter is also a core of the Native Publishing Model that  we discussed in more details in Chapter 11, Web Content Management and  Collaboration. You can find more info on Oracle Dynamic Converter section  on the online UCM Documentation Library.   	 Content Conversion Server  Also known as Inbound Refinery : This is  a standalone server product that converts content between different file  formats. It can also create preview thumbnails. Unlike dynamic converter,  that converts documents on demand, Inbound Refinery performs its  conversion during the check-in process. More information is available in  Inbound Refinery Administration Guide.   	 PDF Converter: This is a Content Conversion Server add-in that allows you   to automatically generate PDF version of a document on check in.  More  information available in PDF Converter Installation and Administration Guide .  	 PDF Watermark: This is an optional Content Server add-on to add dynamic,   configurable watermarks to the PDF documents generated by the PDF  Converter. More information is available from PDFWatermark Installation and  Administration Guide.  [ 302 ]   Appendix A   	 Content Categorizer: This is a Content Server add-on that suggests metadata  values for the documents being checked in, based on their content and other  business rules. You can also use it to mass-update existing content. You can  find more information from Content Categorizer Administration Guide—from  the UCM Documentation page.   	 Content Tracker: This is another Content Server add-on that allows you  to gather detailed usage information and generate reports—for auditing  and monitoring purposes. Learn more about it from Content Tracker  Administration Guide.   	 Web Parts for SharePoint: These are there to integrate documents stored in  Content Server directly into MS SharePoint interface  Supported SharePoint  versions are 2003 and 2007 .   	 UCM Need To Know Component  NTK : This delivers security   enhancements and allows you to alter Content Server security model based  on business rules  See Need to Know Component Administration Guide for more  information .   	 UCM Clean Content Component: This allows you to scan for and remove  unwanted parts of MS Office documents that are known to cause security  risks.  Things such as hidden text and slides, database queries, sensitive  hyperlinks, weak protections, and others. For more information Google   for "Oracle Clean Content SDK" .   	 Archiver Replication Exceptions: This helps you to prevent failed imports  from stopping replication. It captures such failed imports into "exceptions"  archive and sends out an e-mail to system administrator.   	 Collaboration Manager: This gives you project workspaces, online  discussions and another, more traditional security model. However,  Collaboration Manager is an older product and I highly recommend that   you look into using the Oracle Web Center instead.   	 File Store Provider  new in 10gR3 : This allows you to store your content  in a database, instead of a traditional file system. This new approach gives  you several important advantages. See Chapter 7, Under the hood, for more  information.   	 Folders and WebDAV: The Content Server extra that adds support for   Virtual Folders. Please see Chapter 6, for more information.   	 Folder Structure Archive Component: This allows you to selectively   export and migrate just the folders you want, as opposed to exporting   an entire virtual folder tree. See Chapter 9, Migrating Configuration, for  more information.  [ 303 ]   Exploring Oracle UCM Product Offering   	 Content Folios: This adds support for compound documents. They let you  handle multiple related documents as one–just like a ZIP file, but with a lot  more useful features. See Content Folios User Guide for more information.   	 Web Forms Editor: This provides a visual design environment for Hypertext  Content Server Files  HCSFs  and iDoc resource files. See Chapter 10 for more  information on Web Forms Editor.  That's all for the Document Management, and if that's not enough, let's move on to  Web Content Management.  Web content management The WCM allows you to use your content in dynamic websites. It's an add-on  module that goes on top of the Content Server. You'll need ECM to run WCM.  It also gives you a full featured HTML editor such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver  that allows you to create elaborate, efficient and easy to manage websites. All web  pages, images and documents will be stored Content Server  See Chapter 11 for a  detailed introduction to Oracle Web Content Management .  Additional modules we have not covered so far include:   	 Oracle Connection Server is an efficient tool for publishing  and delivering    content to one or more destinations. It can use FTP and other industry  standard protocols, pull and push models, and can apply transformations  to content while it's being delivered. More information is available in Oracle  Connection Server Administration Guide.   	 Oracle Site Studio is a suite of tools for creating killer dynamic websites,  driven by Content Server. Refer to Chapter 11 for more information on the  Site Studio.   	 Oracle Site Studio Publisher  Site Studio Publishing Utility  is a server   product that allows you to publish dynamic Site Studio websites as static  HTML, so they can be hosted outside of Content Server. See Chapter 11 for  more information on Static Publishing Model and Oracle Site Studio Publisher  Administration Guide for more information on SSPU.   	 Oracle Content Publisher is another alternative for publishing business   documents on the Web. Just like the Native publishing model in Oracle Site  Studio, it allows you to focus on your business documents and have the  Content Publisher generate HTML versions for publishing on the Web. And  just like the Site Studio, it also uses Oracle Dynamic Converter to generate  web-viewable rendition of over 200 different file formats.  [ 304 ]   Appendix A  Content Publisher or Site Studio? Content Publisher that ships with Oracle Content Conversion Sever, is an  earlier product and is better suited for less complex websites. Consider  using it if all you need is to publish your business documents on the Web. On the other hand, Site Studio allows contributors to come in and manage  their own content directly on the site. And it gives you, the designer, a  great degree of flexibility to create powerful dynamic websites and build  a library of reusable dynamic fragments. While Site Studio is almost always my first choice over the Content  Publisher but when it comes to Native Publishing, I love the Tutorial  and Seven Easy Lessons guides that come with the Content Publisher  product. Remember, both tools use Dynamic Converter and you will be  creating Dynamic Converter templates exactly the same way—no matter  which tool will you end up using.   	 Content Portlet Suite is a developer toolkit that allows integrating dynamic  content and Content Server workflows into various enterprise portals. CPS  supports WebLogic, WebSphere, Sun One, Plumtree, and WSRP  Web  Services For Remote Portlets . More information is available from Oracle  Content Portlet Suite Developer Guide.   	 Oracle Web Center is a companion product to the UCM suite that offers best  in class online collaboration features, such as team workspaces, blogs, wikis,  and portlets. You can find more information about the Web Center at its  website —Google for Oracle "Web Center".   	 Third-party companion products that compliment UCM and WCM   functionality. They address common concerns and slash the time  and  the budget  you need for WCM implementations. The most useful, in  my humble opinion, is the Site Studio Toolbox™ and other Oracle UCM  components available from Fishbowl Solutions  Check their website at:  www.fishbowlsolutions.com for the full catalog of components and more  information .  That's all for the Web Content Management. The next UCM product group we shall  look at is the URM.  [ 305 ]   Exploring Oracle UCM Product Offering  Universal records management The URM allows you to control retention and disposition of a sensitive content that  requires life cycle management and long-term preservation. Oracle URM is one  of the top players in the Records Management market and is DOD 5015.2 and .4  certified.  Oracle URM contains these modules:   	 Records Manager  Corporate and DoD Editions  is a Content Server add- on that implements URM functionality for electronic content. Find more  information about the Records Manager in Oracle Universal Records Manager  section in online documentation page.   	 Physical Content Manager is the URM module that allows you to keep track   of physical records, such as file folders, boxes, CD, and tape media and so  on. It can be integrated with bar code scanners so you could easily identify  the actual physical items. More information is available in Physical Content  Manager Administration Guide.   	 URM Adapters help you extend the retention, disposition, and litigation   support of the URM to other Enterprise Content Management systems.  While content continues to reside in external systems, such as Documentum,  FileNet, or SharePoint, its life cycle is now controlled by the URM. The  adapters also send information back to the URM server so it can keep  track of all record content in the entire enterprise. More information is  available in the Oracle Universal Records Manager Adapters section of online  documentation page.  And this completes the Universal Records Management group of products. But we're  not through yet. The next UCM product group is Oracle IPM.  Imaging and process management Imaging and Process Management  IPM  enables image capture via Oracle  Document Capture and Oracle Distributed Document Capture. It also offers OCR,  full text search, annotation, and mark-up of images, routing, and approvals.  It also provides means of organizing and searching documents across the  enterprise—regardless of where are they stored or what application they came from.  IPM includes adapters for Oracle E-Business  BPEL , PeopleSoft, and IPM SDK. You can find more information about Oracle IPM in the Oracle Imaging and Process  Management section of online documentation site.  And there is one more UCM module left to look at. Let's look at Oracle IRM.  [ 306 ]   Appendix A  Information rights management Oracle IRM is there to encrypt and secure sensitive content when it's not in  repository—inside or outside the firewall. It allows organizations to retain control  over their sensitive information—even after it has been shared, track content that  was forwarded to various internal and external audiences, prevent unauthorized  access and revoke it when required.  The software itself has two components:   	  	  IRM Server that stores decryption keys and information rights. IRM Desktop—lightweight client that must be installed on every computer  that will be using sealed documents, created with Oracle IRM.  You can find more information about IRM in Oracle Information Rights Management  section of online documentation site.  And now that you've seen an entire Oracle UCM product offering, let's see a   few more easy steps you can take to bump your UCM expertise to an even   higher bracket.  Your secret to mastering Oracle UCM in just  minutes a day You've just finished the Oracle UCM Handbook and its about the time for me to  reveal the biggest of my secrets—the one powerful enough to help you achieve any  one of your learning objectives, no matter how ambitious or even outlandish they  may seem.  Toronto Java developer reveals: "He laughed when I told him that I now lead a Stellent project—but  his jaw dropped when he'd seen us in action, and how the client  treated us like royalties!"  This may well be one of the most important sections in the entire book. Here's what  it is all about.  Many regard me as one of the most respected names in Oracle UCM, but it hasn't  always been that way. Listen, just over five short years ago, I've accepted a team  lead role at a large Stellent Web Content Management migration project for a local  government, without any formal Stellent experience!  I've been somewhat involved  with the Content Server for about a month, but that was it.  Oh, and I forgot to tell  you that the project was in a serious crisis!  [ 307 ]   Exploring Oracle UCM Product Offering  A couple of months after I started, I've bumped into a manager I used to work with  at my previous place. He asked what am I up to and I told him. He grinned and said  that he heard how much of a "kludge" the Stellent was and how sorry he feels for me.  So what did I say?  I took him for lunch the next day but I asked him to meet me in the building! I   used an excuse to bring him upstairs and introduced him to my team, my boss,   and the client.  Man it was priceless! Just watching his jaw drop alone made all of my sleepless  nights well worth it! So how did I do that?  I wasn't tricking him and I couldn't possibly learn that fast just by reading  documentation and bugging Stellent Support. So what was my secret?  It wasn't luck and I didn't have to stop sleeping and eating and just work. Nope.   My secret took me from an average Java developer from the trenches to the   forefront of a foreign field. And the secret is simply this:  I've been learning from the best of the best.  I bet you've heard this one before! So why so few people out there are are using it?  Well, how would you tell the good guys from the charlatans? And how would you  sift through the tons of daily blog posts, tweets, and status updates when most of  them are not even related to Oracle UCM? Will reading a lengthily post about the  health of the guru's cat take you any closer to Stellent mastery?  I took a massive step forward to help you answer the first question—identify the  "good guys". In Appendix B, the Oracle UCM Resource Directory, I've compiled  a list of some 42 blogs, article directories, websites, and magazines you can rely   on for continuous flow of insider information, but who can follow 42 sites on a  regular basis?

[ 319 ]   Detailed Oracle UCM Resource Directory  Service providers In this section I'm giving you some consulting and training providers, and how to  find others if you need to. Consulting providers are first—please see below.  Consulting Selecting a consulting vendor is a matter of chemistry, personal preferences, and  many other factors, so I'll only give you a short list. You can always find additional  vendors at Find Oracle Partner Page: http:  solutions.oracle.com. But before you go there, I suggest you check out Fishbowl Solutions    http:  www.fishbowlsolutions.com , one of the oldest and most reputable  solutions providers in the Oracle UCM space.  Another one that provides refreshingly low prices and unbeatable true lifetime  warranty on all customizations is the StellentExperts.com. And now let's look at your options for custom UCM training.

Check out the last   section of Chapter 10, Customizing Oracle UCM, before you ask yours about it.  Your other option is to go to the source and consider engaging me personally.  From time to time I'm available for a limited number of training and consulting  engagements. Check out About Author section for details on how to contact me.  And if you insist on formal education or you need to get your folks certified—check  out Oracle University  http:  education.oracle.com  and look for the UCM  courses.  And now let's conclude our Resource Directory by looking at books, magazines,   and major whitepapers.  Publications and periodicals Let's start by looking at the few books that cover Oracle UCM and related  technologies.  [ 320 ]   Appendix B  Books At the time of this writing there are only three.

And here's the last one—the only in-depth UCM technical reference book  prior to  the one you're reading now .  The Definitive Guide to Stellent Content Server  Development  By Brian Huff, Apress, 2006   As the title suggests, this book is focused on Content Server customization and  integration. Most of the information is still valid and some is a bit dated. The book is  available in hardcover and e-book formats and as a free preview from Google Books   http:  books.google.com . Below is the book's description from Amazon.com:  The Definitive Guide to Stellent Content Server Development is the most complete  book available for this Enterprise Content Management application.

Throughout the book the author reveals tips and  tricks on security, performance, metadata design, maintenance, undocumented  features, and general best practices.  [ 322 ]   Appendix B  It is complete with appendices detailing the inner working of the Content Server.  This includes a full discussion about the IdocScript language, the JSP integration  layer, and some of the internal Java APIs.

And now let's look at one more valuable source of Oracle UCM expertise, industry  trends and insider information, Oracle magazines and whitepapers.  Magazines and whitepapers Below are the two well-known magazines and three must-read whitepapers you  ought to see.  Oracle magazine  http:  www.oracle.com oramag  Oracle Magazine needs no introduction.

They help you get a broader prospective—the kind of  insight that comes so handy at those critical points, every UCM project goes through.  [ 323 ]   Detailed Oracle UCM Resource Directory Fishbowl content management whitepapers  http:  www.fishbowlsolutions.com StellentSolutions  ContentManagementResources  This page offers you a wealth of resources  many of which I've already mentioned .  What I urge you to do is go to the White Papers and Ebooks sections to the bottom  of the screen and read these three important ones by Billy Cripe:   	 Two Types of Collaboration and Ten Requirements for Using Them—an  eye-peeling eBook that makes you aware of the often-overlooked Accidental  Collaboration and how to reap sizable benefits by intentionally facilitating it. Information Architecture for Enterprise 2.0: Enabling Access, Intelligence  and Participation—a whitepaper that outlines the key points of what  Enterprise 2.0 deployments should include and how it should be  implemented within the organization.
