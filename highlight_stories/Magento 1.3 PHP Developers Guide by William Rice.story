I'd like to thank my girlfriend Vicky for putting up with my late  nights working on the book. I'd also like to thank my family and  especially my mother, for raising me to believe that I can achieve  anything I put my mind to.    To everyone that reads this, enjoy your time developing what you  read in and out of this book. I look forward to hearing from any of  you that develop sites or modules based on what you read between  these covers.   About the Reviewers  Jose Argudo is a web developer from Valencia, Spain. After finishing his studies,  he started working for a web design company. After six years of working for that  company, and others, he decided to start working as a freelancer.  Now, he thinks it's the best decision that he has ever taken, a decision that lets him  work with the tools that he likes, such as Joomla!, CodeIgniter, CakePHP, jQuery,  and other known open source technologies.  In the last few months, he has reviewed books for Packt Publications such as  Magento 1.3 Theme Design, Magento: Beginner's Guide, Joomla! 1.5 SEO, Joomla!  with Flash, and Symfony 1.3 Web Application Development, along with Magento  1.3: PHP Developer's Guide.  If that weren't enough, he authored CodeIgniter 1.7 for Packt Publications, a book  that he put a lot of effort into.                             To my brother, I wish him the best.   Erik Hansen is an entrepreneurial techie with a bent for business. He's the  co-founder and CTO of Classy Llama Studios, an e-commerce-centric company   that he helped start in 2007. He leads a team of developers in providing creative  solutions for Classy Llama's clients.  Hansen's interest in technology is hard-wired in his brain. He started out building  basic circuit boards in his basement as a child, and after being involved in a number  of startups right out of high school, he focused his efforts to become an expert in  Magento e-commerce development.  When he's not staying up until the wee hours of the morning programming  on his  MacBook Pro, of course , Hansen enjoys spending time with family and friends,  reading, playing sports, and listening to music.  I would like to thank Kurt Theobald, Timothy Rhodes, Matt Johnson,  and the rest of the Classy Llama team for investing their time in my  personal development.

[ 5 ]    Magento 1.3: PHP  Developer's Guide  After developing a site or two in Magento, we would want to take our development  a step ahead. Magento 1.3: PHP Developer's Guide is a book for those developers  who want to work with the Magento e-commerce platform. In this book, we will be  guided through the fundamentals of development with Magento.  If we're either frustrated with the "give you all the code" tutorials and articles online  or actually really prefer them then, we'll find comfort in the code examples given  in this book. Each code block in the book is followed by a detailed piece-by-piece  explanation of what each part of the code does. This way, we can get information  about not just the functionality, but also learn about the inner workings of the code  being implemented.  Practical knowledge focused on common requirements of any Magento   development is gained in this book, in both the day-to-day environment, as well as  casual pick-it-up-when-you-need-it situations. This book will add to our development  knowledge, once we go through it thoroughly. We will learn the following:   	 Bettering our standards - We'll begin to understand the standards of   Magento development and learn the outline of Magento itself, following  through to the core architecture.   	 Providing an extremely solid base for development. - The solid base, built   by reading this book and following the practical examples in this book, will  enable us to experiment with Magento's functionality and extend it in ways  unheard of previously.   	 The ability to solve frequently occurring issues. - The time spent developing   with Magento will help us in resolving frequently occurring issues. We'll  learn to build payment and shipping modules. We'll also learn how to  interact with the Magento Core API and importing exporting data for   our websites.   Magento 1.3: PHP Developer's Guide  Extending Magento In this book, we'll be extending Magento in four core areas throughout. These can  be broken down into the following:   	 Extensions of existing functionality with new modules that extend the   functionality of Magento beyond the module's capability.   	 Brand new pieces of functionality that will seamlessly integrate with   Magento's infrastructure to introduce new features to the overall Magento  system, beyond its core base.   	 Payment and Shipping methods which implement either special formulas   for processing payment and shipping, or integrate with existing gateways   of other providers.   	 Wordpress CMS integration to implement Wordpress data into a Magento  store, both through a sidebar display block and a blog using our Magento  theme template.  With each of these methods for extending Magento, we'll go through how existing  modules within Magento do it and how we can too, building real-world examples as  we go along.  Practical examples will be used and explained block by block as we go along.   Every piece of code is run through to start, allowing us to skim through the chapters  when we need the code in a hurry. It is also then backtracked over to ensure that  proper understanding and meaningful explanation is given to every block that is  placed into our modules or scripts. This ensures that no function is unknown, once  the code it written.  We'll extend Magento throughout this book, without touching any of the core  files in the installation. This means that the methods taught in this book and those  used throughout this book, will not affect the core installation of Magento. When  upgrading, we won't need to worry about module malfunctioning.  Core development functionality coverage In this book, we will cover several topics that we encounter when programming  with Magento. These vary from functionality you will touch upon in every single  site you build or maintain that is using Magento to functionality that will be touched  upon not quite so much, but is equally as important to be aware of when developing  with Magento.  [ 8 ]   Chapter 1  Core principles of development We'll learn everything from building modules that are not touching upon  Magento's core installation, to the file structure of Magento, to the core principles   of development with Magento in this book.  System maintenance  Important factors such as upgrading Magento and installed modules, backing  up internal system data, and fixing commonly occurring issues will be covered   in this book.  Payment and shipping module development We'll learn how to build both payment and shipping modules while reading this  book. These will expand upon Magento's base and provide additional functionality.  Module development We will build several modules in this book, from basic modules that bring additional  features to Magento, to fully featured extensions that manage data in the backend  of Magento, as well as having dynamic frontends and their own dedicated URL  structure for display.  Data portability and interaction Probably the biggest factor in choosing any content management system has to, be  whether or not we can get the data in or out of the system. Whether or not it will  integrate with our existing systems is also a large concern.  In this book, we'll cover mass importing and updating of data via Excel documents  and the built-in Core API. These will allow integration with existing backend or  internal systems. We'll also cover how to integrate Magento with third-party content  management systems.  Chapter overview The chapters in this book vary greatly in terms of what they teach, to ensure that  as many topics are covered as possible. This ensures that in depth knowledge of  development is gained from them.  [ 9 ]   Magento 1.3: PHP Developer's Guide  The following topics on Magento development will be covered:  Installing, upgrading, and preparing for  development We'll start by walking through the server requirements for installing Magento   and proceed onto how to check manually and how to check automatically using a  prepared script that Magento provides for you to check hosting environments prior  to installing Magento on them.  Installing Magento manually will be covered step by step, from downloading  Magento to uploading the contents of the zip file to our server and going through the  installation right to the end. Upgrading will then be covered to ensure that Magento  installations are kept up to date with the latest updates released by Varien.  We'll walk through how to perform both these actions through a Secure Shell  connection to be able to use your root server access to speed up the upgrade and  installation process as well as automate it. SVN  Subversion  users will be able to  keep the installation updated using Magento's repository. Overall, this chapter will  make sure Magneto's installation and upgrade process can fit into our workflow and  suit our hosting environment setup.  System architecture In this chapter we'll run through the architecture behind Magento's system, covering  the core file structure and through to how the template system works. This will be  important to understanding Magento as a whole and placing our files in the right  place when beginning development. It will help break down the barriers between  approaching Magento for the first time and developing your first project that plague  most developers.  We'll learn more about the Zend Framework and how it powers Magento's core  architecture. This will be explained for a better understanding of Magento's structure.  We'll also go through the best methods for backing up data within Magento, to make  sure you're covered before doing anything drastic with your installation and that any  data is safe from loss going forward.  [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  Shipping modules Every Magento installation uses Shipping modules to give the user the option of  how their items are delivered to them once they are paid for. In this chapter, we'll  be learning how to build a basic shipping module for Magento that will form a  module skeleton of functions which can be used in further development of shipping  modules. We'll go through what other shipping modules have done and what's  possible when building shipping modules for Magento.  Proceeding from there, we'll build a basic shipping module with a few methods  applied to it, which will put what we've learned into practice.  Payment modules Payment modules are vital in Magento, and we'll walk through how to build a basic  skeleton of a payment module, in the payment module chapter. From this, we'll  learn how they are structured and how to build the base before advancing ahead to  something better.  We'll learn how to add basic events to our payment module to advance it towards a  fuller integration than expected from a basic module.  Basic module creation and implementation We'll learn the basics of module creation to build a simple featured-products module  implementation which features products on a per category basis. This will outline  the principles of structure and implementation of a basic module development useful  for further development.  In addition to this, we'll run through some quick tips that will help with   Magento development. We'll try to resolve a few common issues that arise   during development.  Fully-featured module development with  administration panels With this chapter, we'll be delving deeper into Magento by building a basic brand  management module. This will manage brands and display their details, which will  be output in a dynamic template that has its own dynamic URL.  [ 11 ]   Magento 1.3: PHP Developer's Guide  This chapter will show the implementation and functioning of the administration  section inside Magento, which allows management of our module from the backend.  We'll then use this module and its backend for getting a dedicated URL on the  frontend and a dynamic output for the managed data.  We'll also go through using the Module Creator script, put together by    to speed up our module creation process in the future. This will cover the base  installation of the Module Creator script and how to put it to use.  Integration of third-party CMS In this chapter, we'll be covering third-party CMS integration, the possibilities and  the helping aids in integrating our favourite CMS into Magento for data portability.  We'll use Wordpress as a core example and implement Wordpress into Magento  using a popular extension.  We'll also walk through other options available for implementation with other CMS.  These CMS include Drupal, Typo3, Expression Engine, and Joomla!; the overview  and options available for each are described in the chapter.  Magento's core API Every installation of Magento comes with an available data API for external scripts  and internal scripts to interact with the Magento installation's data. We'll walk  through how it can be used, setting up the API within an installation, and handling  error feedback when it occurs during usage.  We'll learn about the available methods which the API offers and see examples  of what can be done with basic outlay of what comes with a default Magento  installation. Along with this, there will be practical examples of how to put the   API to use with these calls to produce something viable  such as a script  to be used  in the future.  Importing and exporting data Managing data is an import aspect of Magento, and in this chapter we'll be  discussing the built-in methods of mass customer, order, and product data available  within Magento.  We'll go through how to import externally located files for retrieving and storing  information from and to external sources, to mass update or export information with  our Magento installation.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 1  Summary This book aims to provide us with a solid foundation of knowledge to develop a site  upon by using Magento. The ideas gained by reading this book will enable us to use  Magento to build something advanced.  The internal functioning of Magento will be explained in depth, along with  extending the present functions. This book will help us in developing our ideas   into and onto Magento's default installation.  [ 13 ]    Installing Upgrading  Magento and Preparing for  Development  In this chapter, we will get everything setup in order to begin development with  Magento. We will go through the four methods that are available when installing  and upgrading our Magento installation, so that we're able to pick the one that best  suits our path in development.  Please note: upgrading is not a requirement of installing Magento, but it will be  covered in this chapter. This will ensure that we're able to upgrade the system, as  necessary, when an upgrade is released for Magento. Upgrading ensures that the  system remains bug free and secure.  Requirements The following are the specifications that Magento requires in order to run at a base  level. These are not the requirements for tens of thousands of products but will have  Magento running a small installation. These specifics are copied directly from the  requirements page on MagentoCommerce.com for maximum reliability:   	 Supported operating systems  	   Linux x86, x86-64  	 Supported Web Servers:  	  Apache 1.3.x 	  Apache 2.0.x 	  Apache 2.2.x   Installing Upgrading Magento and Preparing for Development   	 Supported Browsers:  	  Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and above 	  Mozilla Firefox 2.0 and above 	  Apple Safari 2.x 	  Google Chrome 	  Adobe Flash browser plug-in should be installed   	 PHP Compatibility:  5.2.0 and above  PDO_MySQL simplexml  	  	  Required extensions: 	  	  	  mcrypt hash 	  	  GD 	  DOM iconv 	  SOAP  if Webservices API is to be used  	  Safe_mode off 	  	  Memory_limit 32M or more    	 MySQL:  	  	   	 SSL: 	   4.1.20 or newer InnoDB storage engine  If HTTPS is used to work in the admin, SSL certificate should  be valid. Self-signed SSL certificates are not supported    	 Server - hosting - setup:  	  Ability to run scheduled jobs  crontab  with PHP 5 	  Ability to override options in .htaccess files  We can keep up to date with the latest system requirements for  Magento at the following URL: http:  www.magentocommerce. com system-requirements  [ 16 ]   Chapter 2  To check that our development setup meets the system requirements  mentioned  previously , Magento Commerce provides an automated solution that can be  downloaded and placed on our server. The script can be downloaded from:   http:  www.magentocommerce.com _media magento-check.zip. After  downloading this file, we must unzip it into a directory and upload the contents   into our directory in which we want to install Magento. Then, we simply navigate  our browser to the URL, appending it with  magento-check.php to run the file.  This file starts with a <? PHP short tag, as opposed to a <?php PHP opening tag.  We'll have to change that in the file, if our server does not have short tags enabled on   the PHP configuration.  The script's URL will appear on the download script's knowledge base entry:   http:  www.magentocommerce.com knowledge-base entry how- do-i-know-if-my-server-is-compatible-with-magento.  When you run the PHP file to check the requirements and your server meets them,  you'll see a screen along the lines of the following:  If the Magento check fails, the server administrator or web host is to be consulted   for advice.  For instructions on dealing with other operating systems,   there are plenty of Magento Commerce Wiki entries available at   http:  www.magentocommerce.com download noregister. Just click the How to Get Started tab.  [ 17 ]   Installing Upgrading Magento and Preparing for Development  Once a Congratulations message  similar to the one in the previous screenshot  is  displayed, then we're ready to proceed onto the installation.  Types of installation We'll go through all the methods available for the installation of Magento, to extend  our knowledge. It's not necessary to know all of them, but it will help us discover   our preferred methods and the one which moulds itself to our development practices  the best.  There are four methods of installation available for Magento:   	 Manual—manually downloading and uploading all files needed  	 Downloader—downloading a script for some of the files which when   uploaded and run, will download the rest.   	 SSH—connecting to the server via shell and running a set number of   commands which will download, unzip, and set all the file permissions  correctly for us   	 Subversion  SVN —checking out or exporting from the repository to   our server, before committing to the local directory where we would like   our installation  Manual This method of installation is dubbed Manual, as we will have to do all the  downloading and uploading ourselves. None of the other methods make us do this  and will automate at least small parts of the process. Unfortunately, not everybody's  server environment allows the use of the other methods for various reasons. So, the  Manual method is vital for those stubborn or restricted hosting environments where  we have no other choice.  Installing We'll start by going to the Magento Commerce download page online, at http:  www.magentocommerce.com download.  [ 18 ]   Chapter 2  From here, we choose Full Release and download in the appropriate format. There  isn't any difference in the formats apart from the size. If we're unsure about the  format which our computer can unzip, then its better to simply choose the most  universally compatible format, the .zip format.  [ 19 ]   Installing Upgrading Magento and Preparing for Development  Once we've downloaded our archive of the Magento files, we expand the archive and  get our full listing of files, as shown in the following screenshot:  One thing to note about the directory structure is that it contains the downloader  and the pear file for two of the other methods for installing upgrading. So we're   free to switch to other methods for upgrading, after an initial Manual install.  Once we've expanded the archive of files that we have downloaded, we connect to  our FTP server, navigate to the folder where we want our Magento installation to  reside in, and upload everything.  When the upload process finishes, we must ensure that the folders and contents of  the folders  mentioned below  are set to 0755 in CHMOD permissions:   	  app etc   	  var   	  media   We proceed by navigating to the URL of our chosen install location. There are two  ways to progress from here:   	 By following the graphical interface and the instructions on-screen to   complete the installation of Magento.   	 By navigating to  app etc  and finding the local.xml.template file. We   duplicate this file and save it as local.xml. Then we fill in all the details  between the tags. This is best done after the first install of Magento, so  that we can see how the data is formatted after the template is used by the  graphical interface for populating data.  [ 20 ]   Those who choose the graphical interface option should see the following when  navigating to the URL of our chosen Magento installation location:  Chapter 2  The license agreement for Magento covers what we can and cannot do with the  software. It's important to read it throughly  if we have the time  as it gives us a  fantastic insight into the inner workings of the Open Source movement and how the  licensing process works.  [ 21 ]   Installing Upgrading Magento and Preparing for Development  Presuming that we agree to abide by the terms, we then tick the box and click  Continue to proceed to the next stage of the installation.  This screen allows  us to set the default locale, the time zone, and the initial  currency for our Magento installation. These can all be changed, once we go into the  administration after installation finishes. However, it's best to set them right away so  that we don't have to change them later. Clicking Continue after configuring these  variables takes us onto the Configuration screen of the installation.  [ 22 ]   Chapter 2  [ 23 ]   Installing Upgrading Magento and Preparing for Development  We'll break this screen down by section, as it is much longer than the previous screens. Database Connection   	 Host, Database Name, User Name, and User Password are all the details   Magento needs to connect to the database we created to install Magento into.   	 Tables prefix will set up a prefix for all table names in the database if we  wish to keep our Magento tables separate from anything else, in case we  have placed something inside the database.  Web access options   	 Base URL, the installation URL on which the Magento installation will reside.  	 Admin Path, which will be appended onto the end of the Base URL to gain   access to the administration of our Magento installation.   	 Skip Base URL validation allows us to skip validation of the URL at which   the installation resides. Base URL validation typically causes issues if setting  a system up for a URL other than the one where we uploaded our files.   	 Web Server Rewrites will enable search engine friendly URLs for our system.    mod_rewrite must be installed and activated, as it is required on our  Apache web server for Web Server Rewrites to work    	 Secure URLs will enable the installation's SSL, if we already have one set up   for the URL on which we'll be setting up our installation.  Session storage options This provides us a choice between storing sessions in the file system or the database.  The difference is:   	 Storing sessions in a file system enables quicker access if we're only going to   have just Magento running on one server   	 Storing sessions inside a database allows easier clustering when deploying a   Magento installation across multiple servers for load balancing  The next screen is the final one and will finish the process of installation through the  graphical interface. It is the screen for creating an Admin account.  [ 24 ]   Chapter 2  The previous screen is straightforward; all the information in it is about the Admin  account, which we'll use to access our system. The only part to take particular notice  of is the Encryption Key field at the bottom. It is advisable to leave it blank in the  case of a standard installation. However, if we install a setup that corresponds with  another on our server  for example, a development or a testing version of a site , then  we will need to copy the previous key into the Encryption Key field.  [ 25 ]   Installing Upgrading Magento and Preparing for Development  Once we've finished this section, we'll see the standard Magento installation success  screen that tells us our Encryption Key. It gives us links to both the backend and the  frontend of our installation, in case we want to progress onto either.  Upgrading When an upgrade is required for our site, we can manually update Magento using  the following routine. An upgrade is not required directly after an initial install.  To upgrade the installation—using the Manual method with a full package  download—we have to:   	 Back up our core files  for "just incase it goes wrong" purposes only   	  	   	   	   Back up the database Back up all code that we have modified ourselves  modules,  themes, skins, and so on  Back up our media directory, which contains all uploaded  images for categories or products Back up our  app etc local.xml file, which contains our  database configuration and encryption key   	 Upload all files from our downloaded full release file. We can either: Skip overwriting the backed up files and upload everything  else or  	   [ 26 ]   	  Overwrite all backed up files and then re-upload them to   their appropriate directories   	 Clear our  var cache and  var session directories to ensure no data from   the previous install version lies around unwanted   	 Point the browser to any page in the Magento installation to run the upgrade   script from the previous version to the current version and we're done!  Chapter 2  Downloader The advantage of the downloader is that we have a much smaller initial download.  Later the script can download the bigger files, saving the extra time taken to set up  Magento. This reduces the initial download from between 40-50 MB to 1 MB and  is especially useful for slower connections. It also means we can stay away from  FTP when it comes to upgrading in the future, as the downloader also allows us to  upgrade existing installations that have been installed using other methods.  Installing To download from http:  www.magentocommerce.com download, we select  the Downloader package. Expanding that displays a directory that looks similar  to next screenshot:  [ 27 ]   Installing Upgrading Magento and Preparing for Development  Next, we upload everything to the chosen Magento installation directory and   load  downloader  URL in our browser. A screen welcoming us to the downloader  is displayed:  Once we click on Start the download process, we'll be presented with a screen that  shows us the download progress. We must be patient, as it could take a long time  before anything comes up. We should keep our browser window open and ensure  that it isn't disrupted in any way. When it's done, the page will look similar to the  next screenshot:  [ 28 ]   Chapter 2  After clicking on Continue Magento Installation at the bottom of the page, we  progress onto the standard GUI in order to complete the installation. We can refer  to the previous section  Manual installation  to learn about installation using the  standard GUI.  [ 29 ]   Installing Upgrading Magento and Preparing for Development Upgrading Once an update is available for Magento, we can load the  downloader  directory  onto our chosen Magento installation URL. We are prompted with a login screen.  We type in our administration Username and Password for the chosen  Magento installation into the boxes, after which, we're be allowed into the  downloader interface.  [ 30 ]   Chapter 2  Here we can install new extensions  should we want to , at the top of the page.  Below, we find a Check for Upgrades button and a list of the extensions currently  installed. We can select re-install or un-install actions from the drop-downs for  each extension as we wish, and commit all the changes at once using the button at  the bottom.  [ 31 ]   Installing Upgrading Magento and Preparing for Development  As we're upgrading, we would want to click on the Check for Upgrades button at  the top. Once the page has refreshed from checking for upgrades, we'll see all the  extensions that have available upgrades highlighted in the table.  Select Upgrade to… from the drop-down, in the extensions you want to upgrade,  and click Commit Changes at the bottom of the page. After doing this, a dialog area  appears which shows the progress, similar to how the install dialog appeared for  showing progress during installation.  We can access any URL in our Magento installation and all mySQL upgrades will  take place to complete the upgrade.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 2  SSH  Secure Shell  SSH is the fastest of the four installations and upgrade options for Magento and  a preferred choice of the four. It is command line only and enables us to do the  entire process without the use of any GUI, besides the client that we use to run the  commands. It is typically available only on dedicated hosting environments and  will be available to those who have root access to the contents of their hosting server  environment. The majority of shared hosting or reseller hosting will not provide SSH  access or root access. VPS usually provide root access similar to dedicated hosting  environments, but it's not standard everywhere.  For each of these stages, we must ensure that we're connected via SSH to our server,  using the following command:  ssh username@server_address Note that the server address can be a direct URL or the IP address of the server  that we are connecting to. Afterwards, we will be prompted for our username's  password. Once we have done that, we'll be logged in and can get to the planned  installation's directory. The command to get there is:  cd  full path to installation directory  We're ready to install upgrade, once we're inside the directory of the chosen  installation address.  Installing Like the downloader, we will still need to run through the GUI after installation.  However, this will be much quicker and we will get real time feedback on what is  happening, once we start executing the commands.  The first line is spread over two lines due to the length of the URL from where the  download is fetched. We have to insert that as a single command. We'll be installing  version 1.3.2.4. We need to switch all occurrences of this version number with the  most current version so that it installs the most recent version of Magento.  wget http:  www.magentocommerce.com downloads assets 1.3.2.4 magento- 1.3.2.4.tar.gz  tar -zxvf magento-1.3.2.4.tar.gz  mv magento * magento .htaccess .  chmod o+w var var .htaccess app etc  chmod -R o+w media  . pear mage-setup .  [ 33 ]   Installing Upgrading Magento and Preparing for Development  . pear install magento-core Mage_All_Latest-stable  rm -rf downloader pearlib cache * downloader pearlib download *  rm -rf magento  magento-1.3.2.4.tar.gz Mac users should replace the line beginning with wget with the  following:   curl http:  www.magentocommerce.com downloads assets 1.3.2.3 magento- 1.3.2.3.tar.gz > magento-1.3.2.3.tar.gz From here, we can access our chosen Magento installation location via HTTP and  follow the graphical user interface to complete the installation.  There is a way to bypass the installation wizard, but it requires the reader  to know all the correct variables to proceed into the required areas.  Information on it can be found at: http:  www.magentocommerce. com wiki groups 227 command_line_installation_wizard.  Upgrading Upgrading is just as simple as installation. Go to the directory of the Magento  installation you wish to upgrade and run the following:  . pear mage-setup .  . pear install magento-core Mage_All_Latest  rm -rf downloader pearlib cache * downloader pearlib download *  After we've executed the previous command, the Magento installation will be  upgraded. We'll just need to access it at its appropriate URL, as with the other  methods, and all MySQL related updates will take place.  If we need to clear our cache and sessions, we can use the following command:  rm –rf var cache * var session *  SVN  Subversion Network  For those unfamiliar with Subversion, there are numerous links in the Appendix  where we can learn about what it is, what it does, and how it can be used on our  platform of choice.  [ 34 ]   Chapter 2  For those familiar with SVN already, there is an available SVN repository setup,  if we want to use it. Those already trained in working with SVN will only need to  know the following command to keep the installation up-to-date or to install it at  another location:  svn export http:  svn.magentocommerce.com source branches 1.3 There is also a trunk setup for versions in progress and in alpha testing, though it is  advisable to not use it in any production environments. In case we want to test it, we  can do so with the following command:  svn export http:  svn.magentocommerce.com source branches 1.3-trunk These commands relate to the 1.3 string of Magento, so for future versions you will  need to replace the version number in the commands.  Summary In this chapter, we've learned how to install and upgrade Magento in all four  methods available to us. We can now do the following:   	   	  	  	  Install upgrade manually, by downloading uploading all files and backing  up the appropriate files we need to Install upgrade via the downloader Install upgrade via SSH Install upgrade via SVN  In the next chapter, we will learn about the structure of Magento and the inner  architecture that makes Magento work. This is key to understanding how to develop  with it. Whether it is themes, skins, modules, or moving it from server to server,  the next chapter will teach us how to handle Magento and where to find what we  looking for when we need to.  [ 35 ]    Magento's Architecture  Magento has a wonderful architecture behind its system. It's a very strict architecture  that relies on us knowing where the files should be placed and how to structure our  templates and modules. But this is part of what makes Magento a great system, in  that it enforces these standards.  Here in this chapter, we will learn about this architecture and how it applies to  development with Magento. We will learn:   	 Where everything is within Magento  	 What all the base directory files and folders do  	 The basics of how the template system works  	 How modules work within the system  	 How the Zend Framework fits into the equation  	 The best methods for backing up Magento  Magento's base structure The fundamental knowledge of Magento's architecture begins with its file structure.  It's important to know what goes where by default, so that we may position our  new files accordingly, especially in terms of ensuring that our development doesn't  overwrite core files.   Magento's Architecture  Base directory The default installation contains the following files and directories in the  base directory:   	 .htaccess  	 .htaccess.sample  	 404  directory   	 app  directory   	 cron.php  	 downloader  directory   	 favicon.ico  	 index.php  	 index.php.sample  	 js  directory   	 lib  directory   	 LICENSE_AFL.txt  	 LICENSE.txt  	 media  directory   	 pear  	 pkginfo  directory   	 report  directory   	 skin  directory   	 var  directory   Each of these files and directories has a different purpose. We'll go through them  to ensure that we understand the function of each. This will help us later, if ever   we need to find something specific, or when developing. It will also be helpful   when we'll be looking to place the files coming out of our new module into the  appropriate directory.  [ 38 ]   The function of each of the files in the base  directory The following is a run through of all the files in the base directory, to show us what  they do:  Chapter 3   	 .htaccess—This file controls mod_rewrite for fancy URLs and sets   configuration server variables  such as memory limit  and PHP maximum  execution time, so that Magento can run better.   	 .htaccess.sample—Works as a backup for .htaccess, so that we know   the default .htaccess file  if ever we edit it and need to backtrack .  	 cron.php—The file that should be executed as a cron job every few   minutes to ensure that Magento's wide caching doesn't affect our   server's performance.   	 favicon.ico—Magento's default favicon; it's the small icon that appears   in the toolbar of our browser.   	 index.php—The main loader file for Magento and the file that   initializes everything.   	 index.php.sample—The base template for new index.php files, useful   when we have edited the index.php file and need to backtrack.   	 LICENSE_AFL.txt—It contains the Academic Free License that Magento    	 LICENSE.txt—It contains the Open Software License that Magento is   is distributed under.  distributed under.   	 pear—This controls all automatic updating via the downloader and SSH.  This file is initialized and handles the updating of each individual module  that makes up Magento.   	 php.ini—A sample php.ini file for raw PHP server variables   recommended when setting up Magento on our server. This should not be  used as a complete replacement, but only as a guide to replace certain lines   of the php.ini server file. It is useful when overriding these variables when  .htaccess isn't enabled on our server.  [ 39 ]   Magento's Architecture The function of each of the folders in the base  directory The following is a run through of all the folders in the base directory to show us   their contents:   	 404—The default 404 template and skin storage folder for Magento.  	 app—All code  modules , design  themes , configuration, and translation   files are stored in this directory. This is the folder that we'll be working   in extensively, when developing a Magento powered website. Also   contained in this folder are the template files for the default administration  theme and installation.   	 downloader—The web downloader for upgrading and installing Magento   without the use of SSH  covered in Chapter 2 .   	 js—The core folder where all JavaScript code included with the installation  of Magento is kept. We will find all pre-compiled libraries of JavaScript here.   	 lib—All PHP libraries used to put together Magento. This is the core code   of Magento that ties everything together. The Zend Framework is also stored  within this directory.   	 media—All media is stored here. Primarily for images out of the box, this  is where all generated thumbnails and uploaded product images will be  stored. It is also the container for importing images, when using the mass  import export tools  that we'll go through in Chapter 10 .   	 pkginfo—Short form of package information, this directory contains text  files that largely operate as debug files to inform us about changes when  modules are upgraded in any way.   	 report—The skin folder for the reports that Magento outputs when any   error occurs.   	 skin—All assets for themes are stored within this directory. We typically  find images, JavaScript files, CSS files, and Flash files relating to themes,  in this directory. However, it can be used to store any assets associated  with a theme. It also contains the skin files for the installation of skins and  administration templates.   	 var—Typically where we will find all cache and generated files for Magento.   We can find the cache, sessions  if storing as files , data exports, database  backups, and cached error reports in this folder.  [ 40 ]   Chapter 3  The template system architecture The template architecture is broken into three areas—two for development of the  theme and one for the containment of the assets:   	  app design frontend default     	   	   layout —For all the XML files declaring which module tied  functions should be called to which template files template —For all the templates processing the output that  is passed from functions called from layout  and structured  into the final output to the user.   	  skin frontend default   —For the containment  of all assets relating to our template, images, CSS, Flash, and JavaScript.  Structural blocks and content blocks Each theme contains structural and content blocks. Structural blocks are the ones  that lay out the theme into sections. Let's take a look at a three-column layout.   The following are the structural blocks in a three-column layout:   	 header  	  	  	  	  left content right footer  [ 41 ]   Magento's Architecture  Here's a visual representation of those structural blocks laid over the Magento   demo store:  In each of the structural blocks, we then have content blocks that give each structural  block its content for output to the browser. Let's take the right column; our content  blocks set for this column on a standard theme could be:  recently viewed products   	 mini cart  	  	 newsletter subscription block  	 poll  [ 42 ]   Here we have a visual representation of these content blocks on top of the Magento  demo store:  Chapter 3  On receiving a request from a user connecting to our site to view the page:  1.  Magento will load the structural areas 2.  Each structural area will be processed through 3.  Magento will gather the content blocks assigned to each structural area 4.   It will then progress through the content block template for each structural  area, to process the output It sends all of this back as final output to the user, who then views the  Magento page that was requested  5.   [ 43 ]   Magento's Architecture  XML layout files To assign blocks to each of these structural blocks, Magento loads an XML layout file  for each request. This XML layout file is called by the URL that the user is accessing  on the site. It declares all modules that are to be loaded in each structural area of the  site. On top of this, we have a page.xml file, which is the default loader for all pages  on the site.  A layout XML file is typically structures as follows:                    <block type="page template_links" name="top.links"               as="topLinks" >       <block type="page switch" name="store_language"               as="store_language"               template="page switch languages.phtml" >                      In the above code, we have:   	  —The handler for the URL, in this case default will load no matter   what other handler is being initialized   	  —The reference structure which calls the blocks in our theme  	  —A content block which defines the type of block and the template   which will process the block's outgoing data in the system  In addition to this, Magento uses actions within blocks for functions which need to  process the data that is input to them, for example adding CSS stylesheets:              css menu.css                 css clears.css        [ 44 ]   Chapter 3       js     varien iehover-fix.js         lt IE 7         css print.css     media="print"              css print.css         media="print"          We'll notice that there are several tags within the action method tag. These are  processed into an array and then passed through the action method="" parameter,  in this case addCss. This function then places the input into an output, ready for its  appropriate template.  Layouts are fully explained online in Magento's designer guide:   http:  www.magentocommerce.com design_guide  articles intro-to-layouts.  Hierarchical file processing When creating new themes, we do not have to worry about copying all the theme  and skin files from the default theme over to our new one. Let's presume that we  have an additional theme called new_theme, alongside our default theme. Our  theme calls files called logo.gif and image.gif on one of its pages.  [ 45 ]   Magento's Architecture  The themes that we have contain the following files in their skin's images directory:  default logo.gif image.gif test.gif  new_theme logo.gif  Magento would process this main requesting logo.gif and image.gif. As  new_theme is our current active theme, it will pull logo.gif from there., However,  as image.gif does not exist in new_theme, Magento would grab that from default.  So now, it works like this:  Requested file logo.gif image.gif  Theme it will come from new_theme default  Similarly, if test.gif were called in our template then it would come from the  default theme. If we upload an image called test.gif to the image directory of  new_theme, then it would immediately come from there instead.  This applies to all files for themes in Magento, which include the following:   	 Templates  	 Layout XML files  	 Anything in the theme skin folders  Magento's template architecture and hierarchy is also explained online  in the designer's guide to Magento: http:  www.magentocommerce. com design_guide  Modules and how they work within the  system Magento primarily works on a base of modules. All functionality is divided up  into modules that make up the system overall. It's important to understand what  each module does and how to go about adding modules to the system, in order to  understand the architecture of modules themselves.  [ 46 ]   Chapter 3  Distribution of the modules between  directories All modules are located within the  app code  directory. Directories are commonly  referred to as codePools. There are three possible locations for all modules that  relate to the system. They are all split by type to prevent any confusion:   	 community—For community-distributed extensions, usually those that we   have installed through Magento Connect or have downloaded from a source,  other than our own. Anything installed through Magento Connect will be  installed here automatically.   	 core—Reserved for core Magento modules, so that we cannot directly   overwrite or interfere with them. We keep our modules out of core to avoid  any conflict with the core modules or any future updates. Anything from a  Magento upgrade or any new Magento modules will go into this directory.   	 Local—This is where we should be placing our modules when they are   either under local development or are not distributed among the community.  It's best to keep anything that we develop in this directory, so as to not  interfere with the core or community modules. Nothing will be automatically  installed here, unless we have physically uploaded it.  Modules included with Magento Included modules in the core folder of default Magento installation are as follows:   	 Mage_Admin  	 Mage_AdminNotification  	 Mage_Api  	 Mage_Backup  	 Mage_Bundle  	 Mage_Catalog  	 Mage_CatalogIndex  	 Mage_CatalogInventory  	 Mage_CatalogRule  	 Mage_CatalogSearch  	 Mage_Checkout  	 Mage_Cms  	 Mage_Contacts  	 Mage_Core  [ 47 ]   Magento's Architecture  	 Mage_Cron  	 Mage_Customer  	 Mage_Dataflow   	 Mage_Directory  	 Mage_Downloadable  	 Mage_Eav  	 Mage_GiftMessage  	 Mage_GoogleAnalytics  	 Mage_GoogleBase  	 Mage_GoogleCheckout  	 Mage_GoogleOptimizer  	 Mage_Install  	 Mage_Log  	 Mage_Media  	 Mage_Newsletter  	 Mage_Page  	 Mage_Paygate  	 Mage_Payment  	 Mage_Paypal  	 Mage_PaypalUk  	 Mage_Poll  	 Mage_ProductAlert  	 Mage_Rating  	 Mage_Reports  	 Mage_Review  	 Mage_Rss  	 Mage_Rule  	 Mage_Sales  	 Mage_SalesRule  	 Mage_Sendfriend  	 Mage_Shipping  	 Mage_Sitemap  	 Mage_Tag  	 Mage_Tax  [ 48 ]   Chapter 3  Setting up the folder structure of a module Let's presume that we want to set up a module's folder structure, ready  for development. Our module's core folders will be placed in  app code local  Book Example .  These folders will primarily be used for storing our code that makes the module  work. The folder structure breaks down as follows:   	 Mage_Usa  	 Mage_Weee  	 Mage_Wishlist   	 Block   	 controllers   	 etc   	 Model   	  	   	 sql  	   Mysql4         Book   book_setup   Typically, developers will pick or choose each folder, depending on whether or   not they're going to use it within their module.  Note that Model Mysql4 Book  has its first letter in uppercase, whereas  sql book_setup  does not. We must be sure to keep this the same way throughout  our development.  Template files for the frontend of our module will be stored as follows:   	 XML files will be stored in  app design frontend       layout example    	 Output files will be stored in  app design   frontend     template example   Any admin template files for the frontend of our module will be stored as follows:   	 XML files will be stored in  app design   adminhtml     layout example    	 Output files will be stored in  app design   adminhtml     template example   [ 49 ]   Magento's Architecture  Here's a breakdown of what each folder is for:   	 Block —For processing of all display blocks called by the system for the  module. These are controllers that will be called in the XML layout files  within a theme, in order to display something.   	 controllers —Our controllers that support the application and structurally   keep things together.   	 etc —Configuration files for the module, for declaring things such as the   default options when installed and declaring all blocks, models, and install  upgrade actions.   	 Model —For placement of all models to support controllers in the module.  	 sql —SQL actions when the module is installed upgraded uninstalled.  Zend Framework and its role within   Magento Magento  at its raw PHP base  is built on the Zend Framework. From the database  class to the handling of URLs, Magento is in its raw form, with Zend Framework  doing all the work. Alongside this, Varien has built several core modules on top of  the Zend Framework, in order to tie it altogether into the system as we know it.  What is Zend Framework Zend Framework's official site best describes the framework as follows:  Zend Framework  ZF  is an open source framework for developing web applications  and services with PHP 5. ZF is implemented using 100% object-oriented code. The  component structure of ZF is somewhat unique; each component is designed with  few dependencies on other components. This loosely coupled architecture allows  developers to use components individually. We often call this a "use-at-will" design.  [ 50 ]   Chapter 3  While they can be used separately, Zend Framework components in the standard  library form a powerful and extensible web application framework when combined.  ZF offers a robust, high performance MVC implementation, a database abstraction  that is simple to use, and a forms component that implements HTML form rendering,  validation, and filtering so that developers can consolidate all of these operations  using one easy-to-use, object-oriented interface. Other components, such as  Zend_Auth and Zend_Acl, provide user authentication and authorization against all  common credential stores. Still others implement client libraries to simply access to  the most popular web services available. Whatever your application needs are, you're  likely to find a Zend Framework component that can be used to dramatically reduce  development time with a thoroughly tested foundation.  How Zend Framework works The Zend Framework  at its core  is designed to be used as a package or separate  modules. This  among other features  makes it unique, as most other frameworks   are designed to be used plainly as frameworks or not at all.  However, the Zend Framework comes with classes that allow us to use it as a  standalone framework and develop with it as one. Instead of being delivered with a  preset amount of directories and layout for developers, it only suggests a layout for  our files. This means that we can adapt the framework to meet our current workflow  and choose how much we adapt the workflow to fit the framework.  It's role and effect in Magento The Zend Framework allows Magento to focus on the core issues at hand. It removes  a lot of the work on the database and core structural classes and puts the work  towards fixing and adding to core modules of Magento.  Most importantly it gives developers a standard approach to development that they  can move across and apply to Magento. The standard development practices help  greatly in adopting Magento as a platform and make it easier for developers having  experience with Zend Framework to adapt to Magento.  More information on learning the Zend Framework and resources can be  found at the back of this book in the Appendix attached. Its official site is  located at: http:  framework.zend.com .  [ 51 ]   Magento's Architecture  Backing up Magento's data It's important to know how to back up our site, to ensure that our installation's data  is not lost  if ever things go bad .  It is recommended to back up our Magento installation:   	 Regularly as a base to ensure that there are incremental backups    of our system   	 Before installing new modules or themes from Magento Connect  	 When developing modules  	 Before upgrading our system  Backing up the files We will need to back up all the files relating to the Magento installation, when  backing up our system. Two of the ways in which this can be done are given below.  Manually Manually, we are able to download all the files of the installation to our hard  drive. This is the longest method of backing up the files and is the most foolproof  method available.  Using SSH Using SSH, we're able to vastly speed up the duration of backing up the servers.  We can do this in two ways:   	 Zipping up all files, if the server has it enabled  	 Copying all files to another directory  Both of these depend on whether or not our server has SSH. So if this isn't available  to us, then we cannot use these methods.  [ 52 ]   Both of these methods require us to connect to our server via SSH first  and then use the cd command to get to the directory  which Magento is  installed in , before running the commands.  Chapter 3  Zipping up all files This will create a zip file of our entire Magento installation's files and folders called  magento_archive.zip.  tar cf magento_archive.tar * To untar this archive, extract the files afterwards:  tar -xvf yourfilename.tar We can then move this to another directory of our choice using the mv command:  mv magento_archive.zip  path to new destination   Copying all files to another directory We run the following command to copy all files  as they are  into another directory  on our server. We'll replace the full path with the path to the desired directory, into  which we want to copy all the files.  cp –R *  path to new destination   Backing up the database We'll need to back up the database as part of our Magento backup. Let's go  through how.  [ 53 ]   Magento's Architecture Using the system itself Magento comes with a built-in method for backing up our installation and keeping  several backups logged, in case we want to download older backups at any time. It  can be found in the System menu under Tools:  The initial screen will be similar to the next screenshot:  [ 54 ]   To create a backup via the System panel, all we need to do is click on Create Backup  in the upper-right of the screen and wait for it to finish:  Chapter 3  The process of creating a backup can take quite a while  especially for bigger  databases , so we will need to keep an eye on our server's memory limits and PHP  execution limits. These are set in our .htaccess file on runtime, but some servers  will only run the defaults and not allow them to be overridden. If we encounter a  white screen instead of the success message  shown in the previous screen , then  the problem is either memory limit or execution time limit. We will need to increase  them ourselves or contact our web host.  Once the backup is completed, however, we'll be able to find it in our  var  backups  folder. They will be named by timestamp and the highest numbered  filename will be the last to be backed up.  Using phpMyAdmin The most common back up solution is phpMyAdmin, and some people prefer it over  any built-in method. To export via phpMyAdmin, we:  1.  Navigate to the database 2.  Switch to the export tab 3.  Select all tables and SQL as the export type 4.  Under options on the right-hand side select Disable foreign key checks 5.  Select save as file at the very bottom of the page 6.   If we want to match the compression type of Magento's output, select  gzipped as our compression method  7.  Click the Go button to export  [ 55 ]   Magento's Architecture  This will give us an SQL file, which we can then import at a later date back into an  empty database and restore our data.  Summary In this chapter, we've learned the following:   	 How Magento's folder structure and files are laid out  	 What each of the base directory's folders and files do  	 How the template system works  	 How modules work within Magento  	 About the Zend Framework and how it benefits Magento  	 How best to go about backing up Magento and when to go about it  Further to this chapter, I want you to read the Magento designer's guide and the  Zend Framework documentation and examples. There are also a very good group  of links for you to read through in the Appendix at the back of this book. These will  increase your knowledge of the Magento architecture and benefit you throughout  this book.  [ 56 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento  In this chapter, we will apply our newfound knowledge of Magento's core  architecture  that we learned in the previous chapter  and apply it to one of   the fundamental building blocks of Magento, its shipping module.  Here, we will learn how to create a shipping module, so that we can develop   our own when the need arises. By the end of this chapter we will:   	 Know where to find shipping modules that others have produced  	 Know how to put together a basic shipping module and know what    values pertain to what information   	 Be able to create our own methods for calculation or handling shipping    with Magento  What shipping modules do Shipping modules are used to define the handling of the order, before it goes  through the payment method section of the order process. They take the order itself  and decide how to go about charging and delivering it to the customer. Magento  takes the order through each shipping module that is installed and active in the  system. Each shipping module is then able to process the order currently in the cart  and present any available options to the user, from what it sees in the order.  For example: we have a shipping module in our system that provides free  delivery to people located within the UK and ordering over £40. Let's presume   that we are ordering £50 worth of goods and are located within the UK. When   the order is sent through this module, it checks whether or not the user is in the UK  and the order total is over £40. If these conditions are met,  which our order does ,  then we are presented with a free delivery option, among others, to choose during  our order process.   Shipping Modules in Magento  This is a very simple version of what a shipping module can do. The full range of  what can be done using shipping modules can be grasped by looking at Shipping  Modules on Magento Connect and finding what it has on offer. Here's a small range  of what has been made public:   	 Royal Mail UK, EU, and Worldwide Shipping module—For calculation and  handling of all of Royal Mail's shipping methods using weight and distance.  This module sends key product information to Royal Mail via their API,  authenticating with information that the Magento store administrator has  input, and outputs pricing for various shipping options on the current order.   	 Regional Free Shipping module—Gives the Magento administrator   the option to allow free shipping by region, instead of by country. This  provides a choice to the store administrator of breaking down free shipping  further than country. For example, this would be good for someone who   runs a store based in Nottingham that wants to reward local customers in  the East Midlands, as opposed to simply giving free shipping to the entire  United Kingdom.   	 Basic Store Pickup Shipping module—Enables customers to choose   between picking up the item themselves and having it delivered to them.  This is advantageous for companies which use Magento and have a physical  store presence with stock held.  Magento Connect can be accessed at the following URL: http:  www.magentocommerce.com magento-connect.  The three core types of shipping module can be summarized in the following:   	 Third-party API and or web service integration. For integration with   existing couriers that have web-based APIs or web services that offer the  same for organization of your shipping. Many existing services make an  API available to us for integrating into Magento. We should check Magento  Connect for any existing modules that others have created.   	 Using customer data to provide unique calculations and opportunities to   certain users. Anything that the customer puts in it while checking out can   be used for this type of module.  [ 58 ]    	 Shipping methods that involve a physical store or location for additional  options that compliment others. We could theoretically build up a set of  stores under the Magento store company's business. We could then link  them up with local computers at the locations and use the shipping module  to check for stocks at each location. We should do that before suggesting the  store as a location for the user to be able to pick up the item.  Chapter 4  How to begin with a shipping module Here we'll be learning about how to begin with a shipping module. This is the  skeletal structure of a shipping module that we can use as a template for any  shipping module which we create. We will also be using it to create a very basic  shipping module at the end of this chapter.  For the purpose of following this tutorial, we will be creating all files in  app code  local MagentoBook ShippingModule , which will be the base directory for all  files created  from this point onwards . We must make sure that this directory   and sub-directory are set up before continuing onwards. This means that if the   file is declared to be  hello world.php, we place this on the end of our initial base  address and it becomes  app code local MagentoBook ShippingModule hello  world.php  Please start by creating the directory MagentoBook in  app code local  and a  sub-directory within that called ShippingModule, creating the directory structure   MagentoBook ShippingModule .  The configuration files We create  app code local MagentoBook ShippingModule etc config.xml in  our module's folder. Here, we'll place the following code which will declare our new  module for use, make it depend on Mage_Shipping being enabled, set it at version  0.1.0 and allow it to use the existing global database connection which is set up for  our store.                        0.1.0                                   [ 59 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento                                  MagentoBook_ShippingModule_Model                                                    MagentoBook_ShippingModule                                 core_setup                                                             MagentoBook carrier_ShippingModule                       Let's walk back through this code and go over what each individual section does.  We start by defining our XML header tag for the file, to ensure that it is accepted   as an XML file when read by the XML parsing class in the system.     We define the   tag, to ensure that everything within it is read as  configuration variables to be loaded into Magento's configuration for whatever   we define internally within this tag.     We define the   tag, so that we're setting configuration variables for  modules defined within this tag.             [ 60 ]   Chapter 4  We set the module's version number to 0.1.0, to supply Magento with versioning  for the module in the future, if we update and need to perform statements within   the update portion of the module, so as to execute above a certain version number.         0.1.0   We have to make sure that our module cannot be activated, or possibly run,   without the Mage_Shipping core shipping handler and module activated. This is  vital because the module being a shipping module is simply going to cause fatal  errors without the parent Mage_Shipping module providing the helper functions  needed internally.                             Next, we close off our module declaration tag and modules tag.             We set up our   tag to define global assets to Magento.       Next, we define the   tag to define global models to the system and for  setting up our module's default model to be one of those global models which is  automatically loaded.                         MagentoBook_ShippingModule_Model                 We define the   tag, so that we can configure the database resources  available to the module within the system.         [ 61 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento  Defining the   tag allows us to include a setup file with our module that  accesses the database. This helps if we need to load in any variables  such as default  table rate rules  for our module, or for loading additional data required locally by the  module, when calculating the shipping rates.                               MagentoBook_ShippingModule             Here, we'll use the core database connection  the default one , and ensure that we do  not overwrite the database connection set up for this particular module.  We close off all tag pairs, besides  , that have been opened at this point.                       core_setup                                    Finally, we end the configuration file with a declaration that our module is a  shipping module and should be processed as one, within the system. This will  register the module to the system, so that it can actually display shipping methods   to the user on checkout. Without this, nothing will be returned to the user from   this module.                             MagentoBook carrier_ShippingModule                     We close the   tag to end the XML configuration file.     After we've done this, we need to declare our module to Magento by creating a  configuration file in  app etc modules MagentoBook_ShippingModule.xml. Next, we place the following code in our new configuration file, to allow this  module to interact with Magento and be turned on off under the System  Configuration menu:  [ 62 ]   Chapter 4                       true         local               We break this file down into the individual lines:     The   wrapper tag defines the XML to be read, as a configuration of  something inside Magento.  The   wrapping tag defines this as a module to Magento.          The next tag is used for defining that this is the configuration of a module entitled    and for applying the settings inside the tag to  the module:         We make sure that it's active by default  this will be overwritten when activated  deactivated in the Magento administrative back-end .         true   The   tag is used for keeping this module in our local module's directory.         local   Closing tags are for closing the XML tags that we started the   tag with.               codePools are explained in full detail in Chapter 3, Magento's  Architecture earlier in this book starting on page 47.  [ 63 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento  Now that we have the configuration set up, to allow the module to be managed within  Magento and versioning control to allow for upgrades in the future, we can progress  onto the module itself. It also means that we can now turn our module on off within  the administration. To do this, we go to SystemConfiguration, then to Advanced  under the Advanced heading on the left-hand side. Once here, we will be presented  with Enable Disable dropdowns for each module installed in the system.  We'll set the dropdown for our module to Disable until we have completed the  adaptor model and administration setup. This will prevent the module from crashing  the system, while it is incomplete. We will re-activate the module once we're ready to  see the output.  The adaptor model The adaptor model handles the core functionality behind our shipping module. From  its name, we can guess that it adapts what we have into a real module that works  and functions. This is something that both shipping and payment modules have.  This is where all the calculations happen and where everything will be coded.   The coding is done behind the scenes to handle the shipping methods and the   rates returned to the user to choose from in their checkout process.  Here we apply the name of our shipping method within our bare-bones template.   For the sake of demonstration, we'll call ours BareBonesMethod in the code to follow.  Our adaptor in this case will be placed in: app code local MagentoBook  ShippingModule Model Carrier BareBonesMethod.php  <?php     class MagentoBook_ShippingModule_Model_Carrier_BareBonesMethod extends      Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Abstract {   protected $_code = 'shippingmodule';  [ 64 ]   Chapter 4    public function collectRates Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Request       $request    {     if  !$this->getConfigData 'active'   {       Mage::log 'The '.$this->_code.' shipping method is not           active.' ;       return false;     }      $handling = $this->getConfigData 'handling' ;      $result = Mage::getModel 'shipping rate_result' ;      foreach  $response as $method  {       $rMethod = Mage::getModel 'shipping rate_result_method' ;        $method->setCarrier $this->_code ;       $method->setCarrierTitle $this->getConfigData 'title  ;        $method->setMethod $method['code'] ;       $method->setMethodTitle $method['title'] ;        $method->setCost $method['amount'] ;        $method->setPrice $method['amount']+$handling ;        $result->append $method ;     }      return $result;   } }  In this example, $response is the parsed array of an API call response to a  third-party service and code, title, and amount are all values of the array resulting  from the request. We'll go through this block by block, so that we're aware of the  happenings at each stage:  [ 65 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento  <?php  We start by declaring our module and ensuring that it extends the shipping class of  Magento. This tells Magento that the module is a shipping module.  class MagentoBook_ShippingModule_Model_Carrier_BareBonesMethod extends      Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Abstract {   protected $_code = 'shippingmodule';  We need to declare the standard collectRates function for Magento to call, when  our shipping method is called.    public function collectRates Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Request      $request    {  We'll skip the rest if our module isn't enabled and log it to the Magento logs, so that  we know it is being skipped.      if  !$this->getConfigData 'active'   {       Mage::log 'The '.$this->_code.' shipping method is not  active.' ;       return false;     }  We want to retrieve our configured handling fee to be added later to the total fee for  this shipping method.      $handling = $this->getConfigData 'handling' ;  We grab our overall result that is being returned to Magento, with all available  shipping modules and rates. We do that in case we need to add to it with any  methods available with our module.      $result = Mage::getModel 'shipping rate_result' ;  $response in the code below is a theoretical example that we have returning from a  third-party API, likely via SOAP or another method. This is not a set array here, but  used as an example for adding multiple rates based on an array.      foreach  $response as $method  {  We prepare the new method that will be added.        $method = Mage::getModel 'shipping rate_result_method' ;  [ 66 ]   Chapter 4  Next, we record our important internal system variables that Magento will use to  store and refer to this shipping method.        $method->setCarrier $this->_code ;       $method->setCarrierTitle $this->getConfigData 'title  ;  Moving on, we add the method's code and title returned in our array to the new  shipping method which will be returned to the user.        $method->setMethod $method['code'] ;       $method->setMethodTitle $method['title'] ;  We set the cost, again from the returned array we have. This is not returned to the  user, but is used internally by the system to calculate profit  price – cost = profit .        $method->setCost $method['amount'] ;  We set the price for the shipping method and add our handling fee that we gathered  earlier from the configured administration value.        $method->setPrice $method['amount']+$handling ;  Next, we add the rate to the result which will be returned to the system.        $result->append $method ;     }  The result is returned to Magento for continuing processing onto the next shipping  module installed in the system.      return $result;   } }  The administration setup Now that we have an adaptor, we need to make it configurable within the  system. We must do so for the Magento administrator to be able to do something  constructive with what we've built. The administrator must be able to:   	 Enter personal details  	 Set up the handling rate  	 Set the cost of the shipping method that we put into the store  [ 67 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento  Our administration configuration file defines how our shipping module appears  within the system configuration; which fields appear and what they relate to are  defined here. Once defined, the Magento administrator is able to configure the  module using these fields to get the desired result from the shipping module.  The file  app code local MagentoBook ShippingModule etc system.xml file  contains all the administration fields for the shipping method, and will be formatted  along the lines of the following code:                                             Bare Bones Shipping inc.             text             13             1             1             1                                 Enabled                   select   adminhtml system_config_source_yesno                   1                   1                   1                   1                                               Package Description                   text                   12                   1                   1                   1                            {specific configurable fields listed here}                                            [ 68 ]   Chapter 4  In this configuration file, we've simply set the options for whether or not the  shipping method is enabled and for a field to describe the contents of our shipping  method to the user checking out through the Magento checkout process. We will  learn how these fields are formatted, so that we can add our own as we want. We  will go through this in the next section.  Declaring further fields and learning how  they're structured A large number of fields are not included in system.xml, as they can be  overwhelming without a thorough explanation. We'll pick and choose our fields  from the below code and insert them between the     tag as we  go through the popular types of fields which can be used for the configuration of our  module. Our fields are all built up in the same format, with the required options for  each field being set out in the format below:     Account number   text   7   1   1   1     Breaking it down, we start with the surrounding tags of <account  translate="label">  , which defines the configurable variable  account and contains its configuration. The translate="label" is a reference  to the   tag that we defined earlier for translation of our module  for  multi-language stores . The value inside the tag will act as a key in the language   file when translating.  The     tag pair contains the name of this configurable variable to  be displayed within the administration. We try to make this short in most cases, with  additional notes added where they are needed.  The     tag pair defines the type of field that will  be shown on the frontend for the administrator configuring this shipping method.  This should be set to one of the following:  text—For a text-input-based form element select—For a select-dropdown form element   	  	  	 multiselect—For allowing the user to select multiple options from a list  	  textarea—For a textarea-input-based form element  [ 69 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento      defines the order of the fields when they are output  within the administration for the shipping method.  The final three variables for each field  that need to be defined  decide when the  configurable variable should appear within the administration. Their values are  always 1 or 0 to define yes or no. Here is a breakdown of the individual tags that  explains to us what they do:  Tag pair         Website-wide configuration Store-specific configuration      What they do Default Magento-wide configuration  There is one additional option tag that is not required, but is important for certain  types of fields. The     tag pair defines a source  model which will populate options for a field. We consider the following as an  example of this:       Enabled     select     adminhtml system_config_source_yesno     1     1     1     1     This particular source model adminhtml system_config_source_yesno populates  the select field with yes and no options for selection. The raw models for exploration of  all the available included functions for the value of this option within your field can be  found in:  app code core Mage Adminhtml Model System Config Source .  For our adminhtml system_config_source_yesno value, the file in question is  Yesno.php within the same directory.  Here are a few more source models and what they produce in our module's  administration for the user:   	 shipping source_handlingType—Lists Magento handling types for    	 shipping source_handlingAction—Lists Magento handling actions for   shipping modules  shipping modules  [ 70 ]    	 adminhtml system_config_source_shipping_allspecificcountries—  Prints out a list containing the two core options All allowed countries and  Specific countries   	 adminhtml system_config_source_country—Lists all countries in the   system. It is usually used by means of multi-select lists for shipping modules  and payment gateways to select the country that they should be applicable to  Chapter 4  Appearing in the administration Once this has been done, the shipping method should appear in Shipping Methods  under System->Configuration:  Now, we will look at the most useful shipping module fields that are used when  putting the shipping module together. These are fields with predefined names and  types that have automatically processed the results that they output. Therefore, they  require no additional coding in the adaptor module to take them on board; Magento  performs these methods straight out of the box.  Free shipping If we want to enable an automatic price-based amount for free shipping with our  method, we can add in a field called free_shipping_enable and combine this with  another field by the name of free_shipping_subtotal. When free_shipping_ enable is set to Enabled by the Magento administrator, then Magento will  automatically take free_shipping_subtotal into account and offer free shipping if  the total amount is above the value of free_shipping_subtotal.  If this field is disabled, Magento will simply process using the default shipping  calculation behavior of the module.  [ 71 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento  The fields are set up as follows, with sort_order and show_in_ values varying:         Free shipping with minimum order amount       select       adminhtml system_config_source_enabledisable<  source_model>      21       1       1       1           Minimum order amount for free shipping       text       22       1       1       1     Handling Handling charges sometimes come into the equation and need to be added onto the  overall transaction. Magento enables us to do this using the following source models  to present what we want to achieve:       Calculate Handling Fee     select     shipping source_handlingType     10      1     1     0         Handling Applied     select     shipping source_handlingAction     11     1     1     0     [ 72 ]   Chapter 4       Handling fee     text     12     1     1     1     Restricting a shipping method to certain countries This will allow us to present the option to the administrator for filtering the shipping  method to be only accessible to certain countries. In practice, this means that if we  wanted to offer only one type of delivery to the United Kingdom, then we could do  so simply by selecting United Kingdom from the multi-select field created by the  following declaration.  The Magento administrator can choose the specific countries from the multiple select  list. Only orders from those countries that we have created shipping methods for will  be processed in the shipping module. This enables them to choose any number of  countries for restricting this shipping method to.       Ship to applicable countries     select     90     shipping-applicable-country   adminhtml system_config_source_shipping_ allspecificcountries     1     1     1         Ship to Specific countries     multiselect     91   adminhtml system_config_source_country     1     1     1         Show method if not applicable     select   [ 73 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento     92   adminhtml system_config_source_yesno     1     1     1     Using our template to create a shipping  method Now that we have our bare-bones shipping module, we continue with the creation of  something that we can see an outcome from. From this we should be able to start   to put together our own shipping module tailor-made for future needs.  The purpose of what we are going to build is going to be very simple: we're  going to create a shipping module that meets the following parameters:   	  	  	   	  It has a handling fee, either per product or for the entire order It can be limited to specific countries It can set a simple flat-rate shipping cost, if 10 products or more are   being ordered It can set another simple flat-rate shipping cost, if 10 products or less   are being ordered   	 All of the above can be configured via the Magento administration  Before progressing, we delete the previous shipping module from our installation  to make sure that it does not interfere with what we'll be building. To do this, we go  back to the Magento Downloader  which we've learned about in Chapter 2  and select  Uninstall from the module's supporting dropdown before committing the changes.  The configuration files This time, we'll go with the directory MagentoBook and the name  FullShippingModule. For this, our  app code local MagentoBook  ShippingModule MagentoBook FullShippingModule etc config.xml  file will look like:                 [ 74 ]   Chapter 4         0.1.0                                                                MagentoBook_FullShippingModule_Model                                                    MagentoBook_FullShippingModule                                 core_setup                                     We turn on FullShippingModule, and allow it to be turned off on from  within the administration. Then, we create  app etc modules MagentoBook_ FullShippingModule.xml and place the following in it:                       true         local               [ 75 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento  Our adaptor For those interested in cutting down on code, unnecessary comments have been  removed  which were included in the previous adaptor in this chapter .  We place the following code in:  app code local MagentoBook  FullShippingModule Model Carrier FullBoneMethod.php  <?php  class MagentoBook_FullShippingModule_Model_Carrier_FullBoneMethod  extends Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Abstract {   protected $_code = 'fullshippingmodule';    public function collectRates Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Request      $request    {     if  !$this->getConfigData 'active'   {       Mage::log 'The '.$this->_code.' shipping method is not         active.' ;       return false;     }      $handling = $this->getConfigData 'handling' ;      $result = Mage::getModel 'shipping rate_result' ;     $method = Mage::getModel 'shipping rate_result_method' ;     $items = Mage::getModel 'checkout session' ->getQuote  -                     >getAllItems  ;          if  count $items  >= $this->getConfigData 'minimum_item_limit'   {       $code = $this->getConfigData 'over_minimum_code' ;       $title = $this->getConfigData 'over_minimum_title' ;       $price = $this->getConfigData 'over_minimum_price' ;     }     else {       $code = $this->getConfigData 'under_minimum_code' ;       $title = $this->getConfigData 'under_minimum_title' ;       $price = $this->getConfigData 'under_minimum_price' ;     }          $method->setCarrier $this->_code ;     $method->setCarrierTitle $this->getConfigData 'title'  ;     $method->setMethod $code ;  [ 76 ]   Chapter 4      $method->setMethodTitle $title ;     $method->setPrice $price + $handling ;     $result->append $method ;      return $result;   } }  In short, this will check whether there are more items in the cart than the   pre-configured value of minimum_item_limit and then apply a rate if it is over  the set limit. If under the limit, it applies another rate.  We'll go through the code in blocks, so that we can understand it better.  First we declare our module as an extended class of Mage_Shipping, to make sure  Magento knows it as a shipping method.  <?php  class MagentoBook_FullShippingModule_Model_Carrier_FullBoneMethod  extends Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Abstract {   protected $_code = 'fullshippingmodule';  We declare our collectRates function, which is the standard function for Magento  to call with the request for rates when processing through all available shipping  methods to it when a user is at the shipping method stage of ordering.    public function collectRates Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Request  $request    {  Here we'll use an active variable set in the backend, when the administrator wants to  disable this shipping method. We will check if the active variable is set to true and if  it is not, false will be returned, so that Magento does not process any further. We will  then tell the module to write to Magento's debug log using the Mage::log function  call to ensure that we're aware the module isn't being used when going through  them at any point in our development process.      if  !$this->getConfigData 'active'   {       Mage::log 'The '.$this->_code.' shipping method is not                   active.' ;       return false;     }  [ 77 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento  We get our handling fee configuration value for adding onto our shipping method  price later on. This variable has been set in the administration of our module and  we're getting it out of the database to be used dynamically.      $handling = $this->getConfigData 'handling' ;  We make sure that our shipping method is declared to the system and that   the result array is sent to the user of shipping methods, if we want to add any   available methods.  In practice this means that we set our method   if available , then add this method to  the result. The result in total  after going through all shipping modules installed in the  system  is then returned to the user for selection of the preferred shipping method.  We also want to get the total amount of items in the cart, as our module depends   on it.      $result = Mage::getModel 'shipping rate_result' ;     $method = Mage::getModel 'shipping rate_result_method' ;     $items = Mage::getModel 'checkout session' ->getQuote                                                   ->getAllItems  ;  If the amount of items in the current order is more than or equal to the amount that  the minimum_item_limit variable is set to, we want discounted rates. Otherwise, we  get the standard rates, as there is no discount.      if  count $items  >= $this->getConfigData 'minimum_item_limit'   {       $code = $this->getConfigData 'over_minimum_code' ;       $title = $this->getConfigData 'over_minimum_title' ;       $price = $this->getConfigData 'over_minimum_price' ;     }     else {       $code = $this->getConfigData 'under_minimum_code' ;       $title = $this->getConfigData 'under_minimum_title' ;       $price = $this->getConfigData 'under_minimum_price' ;     }  We now need to set the internal code Magento will refer to this shipping method as  when setting up orders and invoices in the system. We will then set its title and price  to also be presented in the system and to the user on the frontend who is awaiting  presentation of available shipping methods to them.      $method->setCarrier $this->_code ;     $method->setCarrierTitle $this->getConfigData 'title'  ;     $method->setMethod $code ;     $method->setMethodTitle $title ;     $method->setPrice $price + $handling ;  [ 78 ]       $result->append $method ;      return $result;   } }  Chapter 4  The administration configuration First, we'll create the  app code local MagentoBook FullShippingModule  etc system.xml file using the bare-bones template we put together earlier in this  chapter. We start by changing our carrier label to Full Boned Shipping inc.       Full Boned Shipping inc.   Then we add our text-based fields to the system.xml configuration file, front_end_ type text as per the previous conventions that we used with the following labels and  variable names:  Variable Name minimum_item_limit  over_minimum_code over_minimum_title over_minimum_price under_minimum_code under_minimum_title under_minimum_price  Label Minimum item quantity  if over, the over minimum  rate is applied  Over minimum shipping code Over minimum title Over minimum price Under minimum shipping code Under minimum title Under minimum price  Here's a reminder of the format for the field tags and how they should be formatted:       Enabled     select     adminhtml system_config_source_yesno     1     1     1     1     We make sure to define our sort order as we proceed. As a reminder—the    1  tag pair is how the order in which the fields appear   [ 79 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento  is controlled. From 1 being the field to appear first, the highest number appears last  in sequence.  After we have defined these fields, we add the handling fields and country  restriction fields  outlined previously in this chapter . Once this is done, we   have completed our configuration.  Testing our newly built module We go into the administration under System->Configuration and then to  Shipping Methods. Our new shipping method Full Boned Shipping inc.  appears at the bottom.  [ 80 ]   Chapter 4  We must be sure to fill out the values here in the module and save them. In the  previous screenshot, we have a Standard Shipping method, as there are less than two  products in the cart. It provides Over Two Products special offer! shipping option  when the user has equal to or over that amount of products in their cart. The pricing of  both options has been set to reflect that and a handling charge of 5 per order has been  added, which is applied as per the base currency  Pounds in this case .  To test the frontend, we go to the store and place x amount of products into   the cart  either below or above the minimum item quantity set in our module    and progress to shipping to check if the rates are output. If we see them, then it  works successfully!  Code to allow our shipping module to meet  our needs Here we see some small pieces of code to use within our shipping modules to  achieve what we set out to do, when we created the module for a Magento store.  To get all items in the cart, we use:  $items = Mage::getModel 'checkout session' ->getQuote  - >getAllItems  ; foreach $items as $item  {      process each item here };  Within the items foreach loop, we get the quantity for each item that is currently in  the cart  also a great way to advance the fullbonesmodule built above :  $item_quantity = $item->getQty  ;  We check if a product is virtual or not, so that we don't need to calculate shipping:  if $item->getProduct  ->getTypeInstance  ->isVirtual   {      it's a virtual product } else{      it's not a virtual product }  [ 81 ]   Shipping Modules in Magento  Summary In this chapter we've learned:   	 How to set up a basic bare-bones shipping module template for use in the   future development of shipping modules   	 How to use shipping module-specific fields to limit our shipping module   usage to certain countries   	 How to set up a basic administration section for our shipping module to   allow it to be configured by Magento store administrators   	 How to put together a shipping method that decides on the shipping rate by   the amount of items in the cart   	 Some useful pieces of code to use in our own shipping modules, when   putting them together  Further to this chapter, we should create our own shipping modules for Magento  stores. It is an excellent opportunity to test the knowledge gained in this chapter,   by building modules on our own.  [ 82 ]   Building a Payment Module  for Magento  This chapter is about putting together a payment method for Magento and the  various aspects that go together to complete the process. We'll be using our  knowledge from Chapter 3 on Magento's architecture and grow what we've   put into action in Chapter 4 in building our shipping module.  In this chapter we'll go through the various parts that make up a payment   method, including:   	 The declaration  	 The configuration  	 The functional operation  	 The administrative setup of fields  	 Tying in automatic shipping-tracking code generation and updating into    our payment module  How payment methods work in Magento When it comes to going through an order in Magento, payment methods are the  last stage of the process. Once customer details have been filled in and the shipping  method has been chosen, the payment method comes into play. Its role is to finalize  the order and handle how the customer is going to pay for the item s  that he will   be ordering through the Magento installation.  Magento will take all the order details, including what items are in the order, where  it is being shipped, and all the pricing totals, after which it will proceed to the  payment stage. Magento will load payment methods, one by one and present them  to the customer.   Building a Payment Module for Magento  Once the customer has selected a payment method, then Magento will progress  towards processing through the method's function for sending the data for  processing. This could be anything from sending the request via an API, processing  credit card details, or authorizing them.  The other functions of a payment method are to handle the invoicing, capturing,  voiding, and refunding of payment itself. These are all functions that the payment  method will deal, which we'll go through later on in the chapter.  Payment methods that are bundled   with Magento Let's take some time here to go through the existing payment modules that are  bundled with Magento by default, so that we may learn from them by exploring  their inner depths. It helps a great deal when trying to underneath payment methods  to explore the files in these bundled modules and read through the code as best we  can, trying to understand how everything works.  There are numerous bundled payment methods included with Magento and they  are listed below, with their module names and the subsequent attached payment  gateways that they integrate into Magento:   	 Amazon Payments  module folder name: AmazonPayments   	 Authorize.Net  module folder name: PayGate   	 Google Checkout  module folder name: GoogleCheckout   	 Magento standard methods:  module folder name: Payment   	  Cheque Money order 	  	  	  Zero Subtotal Checkout  Purchase order Saved CC   	 PayPal  module folder names: PayPal, PayPalUk   Exploring through these bundled payment methods after reading through this  chapter will hopefully give us a fuller picture of how they work. A lot can be  learnedby jumping into the directories and files of pre-built modules that are   out there.  [ 84 ]   Chapter 5  Downloadable payment methods on   Magento Connect In addition to bundled payment methods that come with Magento's default  installation, there are well over 100 downloadable extensions on Magento Connect  available for download. These vastly cover the majority of popular payment  gateways that we would want to implement for our installation, including—but not  limited to—the likes of the following:  2checkout  	 ePay  	  	 Fontis  	 Moneybookers  	 Sage Pay  formally Protx   	 WorldPay   	 Bank pre-payment  	 Cash on delivery  We'll also find functional non-payment processing methods such as:  These modules show only a small piece of what is possible with  development of Magento's payment methods and I hope to show   you how to get started with building them in this chapter. Many   more payment modules can be found online on Magento Connect   http:  www.magentocommerce.com magento-connect  and it  is worth browsing through modules under the Payment Gateways filter,  with over 200 individual payment modules available. Looking through  these modules and downloading some of them will allow you to discover  how the internals work as well as what's possible with payment modules.  Let's get started by building a base payment method, which we can build upon and  fill in the gaps with to create our desired method.  [ 85 ]   Building a Payment Module for Magento  Building the base of a payment method Here, we're going to build the base of a payment method. This is something that  won't have a purpose, but to provide us with a base—which we can build on—to  create our fuller featured payment method.  It will show us what the bare bones are in order for you to be able to later go on   and create a fully functional method later on.  Module declaration We need to start by declaring our module to the system. We'll do this by creating the  file MagentoBook_PaymentModule.xml in  app etc modules  and filling it with the  following XML code:                       true         local                                    0.1.0               A noticeable feature is that we're using the    tags, to ensure  that this module cannot be activated or used without Mage_Payment being activated.  This means that if the core payment-handling module in Magento has been disabled,  then the module will not be activated or used in any way by the system.  Module configuration We're now going to move onto the configuration of our module, so that we can fit it  into the system and make sure it works with other internal components.  We'll create a file called config.xml in  app code  MagentoBook PaymentModule  etc  and fill it with the following XML code:           [ 86 ]   Chapter 5               0.1.0                                       MagentoBook_PaymentModule_Model                                                   MagentoBook_PaymentModule                                 core_setup                                                 core_write                                                 core_read                                                         0           paymentmodule paymentMethod           1           Credit Card  Magento Book Payment Module            AE,VI,MC,DI           authorize                       [ 87 ]   Building a Payment Module for Magento  Let's back up slightly here and break parts of this configuration down, so that  everything is clear before we continue.  We start by defining our XML version and the module version. This version  number is used for upgrades of the script later if database upgrades of data stored  or table structures are needed as the script progresses over time. In practice, this  means that if we need to make changes between versions, we can use Magento's  built-in version-control system for modules to deploy scripts between upgrades.   This is primarily used for executing changes, such as database structure or changes  to the database contents between upgrades. Code-only changes between upgrades  should be fine, without an upgrade script attachment to execute any actions:                       0.1.0             We'll now open our    tags for declaration of models and  handling of database resources to the system. We'll begin by declaring our model:                             MagentoBook_PaymentModule_Model                 Next, we'll declare our handling of the database resources to the system. Here, we're  using core_setup, core_write, and core_read as our declarations because we  don't want to use any external database with this module. We would want to simply  use the existing Magento database setup:                                     MagentoBook_PaymentModule                                 core_setup                                        [ 88 ]   Chapter 5             core_write                                                 core_read                               Now we'll set up our default configuration for this module and make sure it is  under the payment system configuration tab in the system. We use the     tags here  surrounding this part of the configuration  to  declare to Magento that this is a payment module to be added to the system:                     We've to make sure that this module isn't set to active by default, when it's  installed. We'll have to set it to 1 if we want it to automatically become active:           0   We must ensure that we're referencing the paymentMethod model:           paymentmodule paymentMethod   We'll set the default order status for new orders to processing:           1   We'll name our block of configurable variables in the administration:           Credit Card  Magento Book Payment Module    Then we'll define which credit card types are available to this module:           AE,VI,MC,DI   The default payment action for this module is now declared. This is a choice between  Authorize and Authorize and Capture. Authorize confirms that the payment  method is correct and valid, whereas Authorize and Capture grabs the payment  from the account at the same time as verification. There are two possible values for  this tag: authorize and authorize_capture. The differences between these two  core functions will be explained later in the chapter.           authorize   [ 89 ]   Building a Payment Module for Magento  We can then close all our open tags to make sure this file is processed properly:                       Hopefully this has brought us closer to understanding the payment method's  configuration file.  The adaptor model Our adaptor model is responsible for adapting the model towards a functional tool  to be used by the system. In our case all functionality is stored within this file.  We'll create a file called PaymentMethod.php in  app code local CompanyName  NewModule Model  and place the following code within it:  <?php class MagentoBook_PaymentModule_Model_PaymentMethod extends Mage_ Payment_Model_Method_Cc {   protected $_code = 'paymentmodule';   protected $_isGateway = true;   protected $_canAuthorize = true;   protected $_canCapture = true;   protected $_canCapturePartial = false;   protected $_canRefund = true;   protected $_canVoid = true;   protected $_canUseInternal = true;   protected $_canUseCheckout = true;   protected $_canUseForMultishipping = true;   protected $_canSaveCc = false;   public function authorize Varien_Object $payment, $amount    {      $data = $payment->getData  ;       *    $data = array        store_id,       customer_payment_id,       method,       additional_data,       po_number,       cc_type,       cc_number_enc,  [ 90 ]   Chapter 5        cc_last4,       cc_owner,       cc_exp_month,       cc_exp_year,       cc_number,       cc_cid,       cc_ss_issue,       cc_ss_start_month,       cc_ss_start_year,       parent_id,       amount_ordered,       base_amount_ordered,       shipping_amount,       base_shipping_amount,       method_instance           *  }   public function capture Varien_Object $payment, $amount    {        Grab stored payment data array for processing     $paymentData = unserialize $payment->getAdditionalData   ;   }   public function void Varien_Object $payment    {     }   public function refund Varien_Object $payment, $amount    {        actions when order is refunded occur here      actions when order is voided occur here    } } ?>  [ 91 ]   Building a Payment Module for Magento  Let's go over the meaning of these initial variables' set up in our payment method  class before we continue:  $_isGateway      $_canAuthorize     $_canCapture     $_canCapturePartial   $_canRefund                 $_canVoid    $_canUseInternal   $_canUseCheckout      $_ canUseForMultishipping  $_canSaveCc   Is this a payment gateway?  Uses authorize or capture  methods  Can this module authorize?  Is the authorize function  available?  Can this gateway capture payment?  Is the capture  function available?  Can this module partially capture payments? Can this module refund payments?  Is the refund  function available?  Can this module void payments?  Is the void function  available?  Can this payment module appear in the Magento  payment modules administration panel? Can this module show as a method in the Magento  checkout? Is this module multi-shipping compatible?  Can this module save credit card information for  future processing?  What this code does is that it provides a very solid base for building our payment  method. Here, we have:   	 Our class declaration and initial payment module declaration to Magento  	 Our protected variables which define to Magento what the module can   and cannot do, so that it automatically restricts how the module operates   	 Four functions defining key operations of a payment method:  	  	  	  	   authorize    capture    void    refund    [ 92 ]   Chapter 5  Payment information storage The $payment model that gets passed to each of the methods in our class is  an instance of Mage_Sales_Model_Order_Payment. Every time a payment is  processed, the data for that payment is stored in the sales_flat_quote_payment  table. There is an additional_data field that our module could use to store values  for each transaction.  Four core components The four core components of a payment module are key operations that can be  defined into two blocks, as follows:   	 The processing of the payment prior to completing the sale  	 After the order has had its payment successfully authorized and captured  Let's go through both of these now and understand a little more about how the core  operations work. The processing of the payment The processing of the payment covers the authorize   and capture   functions.  Going back to our module's configuration, the  < payment_ action> tags define which of the two functions is called, once the initial order  has taken place. We've set this to Authorize Only, which by default which will  call authorize   and capture   later when we click the capture button after  invoicing. But if we choose Authorize and Capture, then only the capture    function is called.  Our code for authorizing and capturing payment will need to be placed  appropriately within these functions. The choice to be made between the two options  should depend on our choice of payment gateway that we're building the module  for. An Authorize Only approach means that payment is held until we decide to  capture it, whereas Authorize and Capture will automatically take payment as soon  as it is authorized. This will highly depend on the workflow that we had in mind for  the module.  [ 93 ]   Building a Payment Module for Magento  Let's recap on how these two functions operate under the two core options in our     tags.  Choice Authorize Only  authorize   Authorizes the customer's  payment method via our  payment gateway and  does not capture the actual  payment. It waits for further  processing before doing  so. This happens when the  order is placed and happens  automatically.  Authorize and Capture  Isn't executed at any point.  capture   Once the customer is  invoiced via Magento a  capture button appears  in the upper right of  the invoice screen  within Magento's  administration. When  clicked, this will then  execute the contents  of the function for the  payment module the user  has authorized through.  This happens after the  order has been placed  and it happens manually. Automatically takes  care of both the role  of authorize   and  capture   functionality  at checkout immediately  upon the order being  placed. Note: This does  not call authorize    automatically; it will  only call capture    which should be built to  handle both sides of the  functionality.  After the order has had its payment successfully  processed The return   and void   functions are called when an administrator goes into an  order after invoicing and clicks the Return or Void buttons in the upper right of  the order screen. The code placed within these functions will determine how the  payment method handles an order once these buttons have been clicked.  [ 94 ]   Declaring configuration options for the admin  panel Now that we have a module with the required functionality and setup, we'll need to  declare our configuration options, which appear on the payment methods page of  the System -> Configuration menu.  Chapter 5  Setting up the core fields Create a file called system.xml in  app code local MagentoBook  PaymentModule etc  and start by filling it with the following XML code:                                             NewPayment Module             670             1             1             0                          {…fields…}                                            Replace {…fields…} with the following fieldset XML code:       Enabled     select     adminhtml system_config_source_yesno     1     1     1     0         New order status     select   [ 95 ]   Building a Payment Module for Magento     adminhtml system_config_source_order_status_processing        4     1     1     0         Title     text     2     1     1     0     As you can see in the XML, it does not matter which order you place the fields in.  Only the sort_order field name will be used when deciding the order of the fields  on output in the section of the Magento administration.  This would create three base fields for the module, as follows:  Field name Enabled New order status  Title  What it would be used for To turn the module on off within the system Gives us the ability to choose Authorize Only or  Authorize and Capture The title of the module when presented to the user  These three fields are a suggested base for the module in order to control the very  basics of our payment module. It's a suggestion to enable control of whether or not  the module is enabled, the new order status, and the title of the module itself on the  frontend when presented to the user as a form of payment method they can choose  on checkout. If we go to System->Configuration and choose Payment Methods from the sidebar  menu, we would see a New Module group of configurable options for our module.  [ 96 ]   Some other field types you can use There are numerous other fields that we can setup for our module which can be  grabbed from pre-existing modules in Magento at the moment. These come in handy  as we won't need to set them up ourselves and they slot in easily. A typical field  setup is as follows:  Chapter 5       Title     text     2     1     1     0     In our scenario the    tag pair is the most  important tag pair, as this is the only value we change when pre-populating field  types. The following are examples of values which can be placed inside these tags   to produce different fields:   	 adminhtml system_config_source_yesno—returns yes or no for you   field type   	 adminhtml system_config_source_order_status_new—returns an   array of options for use when selecting a new order's status   	 adminhtml system_config_source_email_identity—returns a list   of email identities in the system from which to send emails from   	 adminhtml system_config_source_email_template—returns a list   of email templates in the system from which to send emails with   	 adminhtml system_config_source_payment_cctype—returns a list of   credit card types, useful for multi-selects when deciding the types of cards  that we would want our module to accept  We'll have a look at the file  app code core Mage adminhtml Model System  Config Source.php to see all the options available to us as source models.  This could potentially unveil some additional options that will benefit us in our  module development.  [ 97 ]   Building a Payment Module for Magento Obscuring fields We could use the following pair to obscure data in the backend and reveal the data  when it placed back into the field on its way out of the database:   obscure   adminhtml system_config_backend_encrypted     This would, of course, be placed within our standard field tag. Take the following  example from Google Checkout's setup:       Merchant ID     obscure     adminhtml system_config_backend_encrypted         20     1     1     0     The backend_model makes sure it is encrypted when put into the database and the  frontend_type means that it's unencrypted on the way back out.  Custom fields from our models We can create our own field population source models by making use of the Models   directory. Take the following example from the Google Checkout module's  app  code core Mage GoogleCheckout etc system.xml file:       Checkout Image Style     select     googlecheckout source_checkout_image     40     1     1     0     [ 98 ]   Chapter 5  This calls the model  app code core Mage GoogleCheckout Model Source  Checkout Image.php and the inner function toOptionArray  .This returns the  values to Magento, which handles the output into the Magento administration.   Take a read of the file should you be interested in digging further into how they  make it work.  Tying in automatic shipping tracking updating The following is an example of payment methods offering a specialized feature in  hooking up shipping integration. Hopefully, we should be able to take something  from this and be able to either re-apply these methods within our payment modules  or apply similar methods in our custom modules built for Magento.  Automatic shippingtracking and   code-generation tie-in Amazon Payments has a setup due to which, if we mark an item as shipped or  update the tracking code for that order, then it will report the codes and the status   of the order for tracking in their system back to Amazon.  This is useful in several ways:  It helps the user stay in the loop without coming to the website   	  	 The user somewhat expects this to happen if their payment gateway that  they are paying through provides this as functionality with other websites   	 This then, of course, helps them relate to our brand more and gives them the   unexpected surprise that makes them come back or talk about the site more  This is done via observation on events in the system. The two events that the module  observes and then acts upon are:   	 The confirmation of an order shipment  	 The saving of a tracking shipping number to an order  If the  app code core Mage AmazonPayments etc config.xml file is opened  in default installation of Magento, we'll see the following code that defines the  observers in the system between    tags:                               model   [ 99 ]   Building a Payment Module for Magento           amazonpayments observer           confirmShipment                                               model           amazonpayments observer           salesOrderShipmentTrackSaveAfter                         This XML information and set of fields defines the observers so that information is  passed to a set type of class and method for processing. Take the second definition  for example:                     model         amazonpayments observer         salesOrderShipmentTrackSaveAfter               This makes sure that when a sales order shipment tracking code is saved, directly  afterwards the AmazonPayments module will look for:   	 Something in the  model  folder of  defined in the    tag pair   	 The AmazonPayments module called Observer.php  defined in the      tag pair    	 The salesOrderShipmentTrackSaveAfter   method within this file    defined in the    tag pair   [ 100 ]   On the other end of these observers is the model file itself  Observer.php  that sits  within the  model  folder of the AmazonPayments module folder. If we go to  app  code core Mage AmazonPayments Model Observer.php we'll see the code for the  methods that are on the other end of these observers that are set:  Chapter 5  class Mage_AmazonPayments_Model_Observer {   public function confirmShipment Varien_Event_Observer $observer    {     $shipment = $observer->getEvent  ->getShipment  ;     if  $shipment->getOrder  ->getPayment  ->getMethod   !=  'amazonpayments_cba'  {       return;     }     Mage::getModel 'amazonpayments api_cba'        ->confirmShipment $shipment ;   }   public function salesOrderShipmentTrackSaveAfter Varien_Event_ Observer $observer    {     $track = $observer->getEvent  ->getTrack  ;     $order = $track->getShipment  ->getOrder  ;      * @var $order Mage_Sales_Model_Order *      if  $order->getPayment  ->getMethod   != 'amazonpayments_cba'  {       return;     }     Mage::getModel 'amazonpayments api_cba'        ->sendTrackingNumber $order, $track ;   } }  There are a few key areas to pick up upon here that are important when replicating  this functionality in your own modules. Let's go through a few certain key blocks to  ensure we're benefiting from reading this code.  We start by noticing that Varien_Event_Observer $observer is the only variable  being caught within both of these functions. This is how observers are setup and  work with the system to properly process the event they are observing. A notable  aspect is that these functions are public, and not private.  public function confirmShipment Varien_Event_Observer $observer  {  [ 101 ]   Building a Payment Module for Magento  Next, we've got a block of code for ensuring that the payment method used for this  order is actually Amazon Payments CBA. This is important, as Amazon Payments  doesn't need to hear about orders placed through other payment gateways. This is  vital to ensuring smooth integration of the payment module. If the payment method  isn't amazonpayments_cba then we can simply return nothing and let Magento carry  on as usual through the other observers waiting for this action to occur.  $shipment = $observer->getEvent  ->getShipment  ; if  $shipment->getOrder  ->getPayment  ->getMethod   !=  'amazonpayments_cba'  {   return; }  It's also important to notice the code separation going on here. The observer class  is only used for receiving notification of the event. All actual executed code is in  external models that are built for the next step. We can see how they've included   an external model here:  Mage::getModel 'amazonpayments api_cba'    ->confirmShipment $shipment ;  The last thing to notice from the functions at hand is the way they gather   the shipping, tracking, and order information and how they make use of the  $observer class.  $shipment = $observer->getEvent  ->getShipment  ;  And in the second function within the class:  $track = $observer->getEvent  ->getTrack  ; $order = $track->getShipment  ->getOrder  ;  These methods could be used in our observer classes if we wish to place them   within our built payment modules.  To see how the objects created by those three functions are processed, open the file   app code core Mage AmazonPayments Model Api Cba.php and search for the  functions that the two observer functions execute from this file when looking to the  executable action of the observation they were there to observe:   	 confirmShipment  	 sendTrackingNumber  These two functions teach us a lot about how to learn more about those three  variables created and passed to the functions. They also elaborate on how the   three variables are used when passed through to the resulting function.  [ 102 ]   We'll also see the same two observers across other bundled payment gateways such  as Google Checkout, which should be explored for further depth of information on  the topic.  Chapter 5  Summary In this chapter, we learned the following:   	 Which payment methods are bundled with Magento by default  	 The popular payment methods that can be downloaded from Magento   Connect   	 How to put together the basics of a payment method for Magento and   the core functions Magento uses automatically from the methods it uses   	 How to setup the fields as well as how to obscure and encrypt them  	 How to link in our own pre-populated arrays of field values from our     	 Tying in automatic shipping-tracking code generation and updating into    custom models  our payment module  Further, we should research the other payment methods available on Magento  Connect. These will help us learn more about how payment methods are structured  and function internally. When we try to create functionality for us, we will learn in  depth about the existing payment methods.  We should also be able to create our own payment methods for our Magento  installations that need them.  [ 103 ]    Building a Basic Featured  Products Module  In this chapter, we will learn how to put together a basic module in Magento.  This module will allow us to feature products on the site and within our product  categories. This will introduce us to some of the basics of module development in  Magento and enable us to form a fundamental base for future module development.  One of the most implemented features on a Magento site is the ability to feature  products. Whether it is the home page, or the sidebar, or the footer, featured  products are a fundamental building block of an e-commerce website. Typically this  is done through banner advertising, but with this module we'll use the products  themselves as a base for our information. We'll display product blocks on the  site using this featured product data, gathered dynamically in the administrative  backend of Magento.  How it works To make this happen, we'll set up an attribute in our system to mark a product as  featured and then create a bespoke module that will allow us to display products  marked as featured on a per category basis. The process for getting a product to appear in the Featured Product block will go  as follows:   	 Create or edit a product  	 Find the field featured and select yes from the dropdown  	 Save the product information that we have changed or created  	 Go to a category that this product is assigned to and it will appear   Building a Basic Featured Products Module  To build our module we will:   	 Create the attribute  	 Create our module with the core functionality  	 Extend the category view to include our featured product display  	 Create templates for display  	 Define the module in our local.xml module configuration file  	 Add in our XML block declaration, so that the module displays on   the frontend, and get started  Creating the attributes in the system We'll start by going to Catalog -> Attributes -> Manage Attributes from within  the administration.  Next, we'll click on Add New Attribute in the upper right of the Manage  Attributes screen.  [ 106 ]   The New Product Attribute screen is shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 6  Setting the field values We'll set the fields on this page as follows, to set up our Featured Product attributes  in the system.  Attribute Properties The properties of each attribute from the previous screenshot is given below:  Field name Attribute Code Scope Catalog Input Type for Store Owner Default Value Unique Value  not shared with other products  Values Required Input Validation for Store Owner Apply To  Field value featured Store View Yes No No No No None All Product Types  [ 107 ]   Building a Basic Featured Products Module Frontend Properties The Frontend Properties are described as follows:  Field name Use in quick search Use in advanced search Comparable on Front-end Use In Layered Navigation  it also refers to  Multiple Select and Price.  Visible on Product View Page on Front-end  Field value No Yes No No  Yes  Ignore all other attributes that appear and leave  them as their default values  Manage Label Options This is found by clicking on the Manage Label Options tab on the left-hand side  of the current page. We chose Featured Product as our label for this attribute when displayed.  However, we can replace this field value with another one, if we want something  else to appear.  Field name Admin  Field value Featured Product  The Manage Label Options tab will look something like this:  We must remember to save our attribute to complete this section of the chapter. Following this you will need to go to Catalog -> Attributes -> Manage Attribute  Sets. Once here select your chosen attribute set that you'd like to add this new  featured attribute into. You can repeat this step multiple times, should you want to  for each attribute set that you’d like to add the attribute to.  [ 108 ]   Chapter 6  I've chosen to select Default in this example.  You should see the attribute that we've created under Unassigned Attributes on  the right hand side of the screen that now appears.  Proceed by clicking and holding your mouse down to drag and drop the featured  attribute into the attribute group of your choice in the middle.   [ 109 ]   Building a Basic Featured Products Module  You should now see something along the lines of the following with the featured  attribute under the group:  Creating the core module with functionality We'll now create the function that allows us to present the products that are featured  to our block, for displaying them to the end user. The class that we created contains  the function that expands existing Magento catalog functionality. This occurs so that  we can interact with other catalog functionality directly and integrate directly with  the existing class files.  We'll create the file Featured.php and the directories to create the path: app code  local MagentoBook Catalog Block Product Featured.php.  For adding functionality, we'll edit the newly created Featured.php file and place  the following in it:  <?php class MagentoBook_Catalog_Block_Product_Featured extends                      Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_Abstract {   protected $_limit = 1;   public function getFeaturedProducts     {     $productCollection = Mage::registry 'current_category' -        >getProductCollection  ;  [ 110 ]   Chapter 6      Mage::getModel 'catalog layer' ->prepareProductCollection         $productCollection ;     $productCollection       ->addAttributeToFilter 'featured', true        ->setPageSize $this->_limit        ->load  ;     return $productCollection; }   public function setLimit $limit = null    {     if intval $limit  > 0        $this->_limit = intval $limit ;   } } ?>  Let's break this down, so that we fully understand the contents of the file.  First, we'll declare the class, which will extend the core Mage_Catalog module to  integrate directly into the system and allow us to interact with core functionality   that we need in order to create this module:  <?php class MagentoBook_Catalog_Block_Product_Featured extends     Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_Abstract {  We'll then set up the $_limit variable, which will hold the number of featured  products that are to be fetched:  protected $_limit = 1;  Next, we'll declare getFeaturedProducts with which we will grab the featured  product for the current category:  public function getFeaturedProducts     {  We'll build $productCollection result by building a base line query for get  products for current category:      $productCollection = Mage::registry 'current_category' -        >getProductCollection  ;     Mage::getModel 'catalog layer' ->prepareProductCollection         $productCollection ;  [ 111 ]   Building a Basic Featured Products Module  We'll then add filters to make sure that we only select where the Featured attribute  is set to true  or Yes  and limit the results to the amount stored in the variable   which we set earlier in the class .      $productCollection       ->addAttributeToFilter 'featured', true        ->setPageSize $this->_limit        ->load  ;  This is then returned for usage in the template file of the module's output:      return $productCollection; }  We will end the file with the setLimit function, which allows us  or anyone using  the module  to override the output limit:    public function setLimit $limit = null    {     if intval $limit  > 0        $this->_limit = intval $limit ;   }  We'll end our class declaration and our file:  } ?>  That completes the class file of our module!  Adding the XML block declaration for display  of the module on the frontend We'll open  app design frontend default default layout catalog.xml.  We want to add a new   right above the Product List block in the Default  Category layout. We'll search for the   tag and the content within it.  Once we've found this, we have two choices as to where we can place our featured  content block, The choices are   and <reference  name="content">, which both relate to the left sidebar of our layout and the content  layout. We can also add other references between these tags, if the layout requires it.  [ 112 ]   Chapter 6  Once we've chosen the relevant reference tag, we add in the following block to call  our module that we have put together every time the category page loads:  <block type="catalog product_featured" name="product_featured"            as="product_featured"            template="catalog product featured.phtml">      <block type="catalog product_featured" name="product_featured"                template="catalog product featured.phtml">       2      The template address catalog product featured.phtml, can be replaced with  whatever custom file we want, if we wish to separate the template out from the  existing set that comes with Magento's default frontend theme.  It's worth noting that the following code sets how many products should be returned  by the template:    2    With the code we've just inserted, two featured products will output. To change,  simply switch the number '2' for the number of products you'd like to output in your  template files.  The product_featured return statement from our previous section in putting  together the module is featured here. Imagine this block as the part where Magento  requests product_featured and the View.php file that we built above as the part of  our module that returns the appropriate content.  Creating templates for display In order for our module to appear, we need our templates to call the function that  we've created at some point. In this case, we presume that we've gone with the  choice of   and include the featured block in the  content area of our layout.  We'll open up the View.phtml file located at  app design frontend default  default template catalog category View.phtml and add the following code  above the first occurrence of  getProductListHtml  ; ?> in  this template file:   getFeaturedProductHtml  ; ?>  getChildHtml 'product_featured' ; ?>  [ 113 ]   Building a Basic Featured Products Module  This will place our Featured Product content block above the place where products  are output.  We'll now need a physical template file for our featured product block, in order for  it to display our featured products. To do this, we'll create featured.phtml  if it  doesn't exist already  at the location  app design frontend default default  template catalog product featured.phtml and place some code within it to  present our featured products out onto the website.  Here is an example that shows  in code order :    	 The name of the product linked to its individual product page  	  	 An Add to Cart button for the user to add it into their cart directly from   Its image at a 200 x 200 size  where it is displayed   	 A check to see if the item is out of stock or not before displaying the Add   to Cart button, with a warning message if it is in fact out of stock  <?php  foreach $this->getFeaturedProducts   as $_product : ?>    getAddToCartUrl $_product  ?>"              method="post" id="product_addtocart_form">      getProductUrl   ?>">          htmlEscape $_product->getName    ?>      <img class="product-image" src="<?php echo          $this->helper 'catalog image' ->init $_product, 'small_image' -         >resize 200, 200  ?>" alt="<?php echo $this         ->htmlEscape $_product->getName    ?>"  >     <?php if $_product      ->isSaleable   : ?>       <button class="form-button" onclick="setLocation            ' getAddToCartUrl $_product  ?>' ">              __ 'Add to Cart'  ?>                <?php echo            $this->__ 'Out of stock'  ?>               [ 114 ]   Chapter 6  Defining the module in the local .xml module  configuration file Now that everything is in place, we need to ensure that our module is declared  to Magento by including it in our local.xml file. We can find this file in the   app etc  directory.  We'll add the following inside the    global tag pair that  surrounds all inner declaration tags:                     MagentoBook_Catalog_Block_Product_Featured                              MagentoBook_Catalog_Block_Category_View                       Once this is done, our Featured Products module will be included in the system.  We do not need to activate deactivate the module, as it extends a core component   of Magento and for this reason does not need to be declared separately.  This concludes adding a featured product section into your Magento   category templates.  Summary In this chapter, we've learned:   	 How to put together a basic module in Magento  	 How to create a featured product attribute which allows us to feature   products by which category the user is currently browsing  We must continue developing these modules further to fit our specific needs, to  extend other parts of Magento's core modules, and to integrate what we've learned  in this chapter into our Magento implementations.  [ 115 ]    Fully-Featured Module for  Magento with Admin Panel  In this chapter, we'll go through the basics of module development, right from  getting a simple Hello World message displayed to managing the module's  information in the database and making it into a dynamic extension of Magento.  This extension will be used to manage the output of brands on a page that will be  displayed on the frontend of our installation.  We'll go through:   	 Getting the module set up using a pre-built module creation tool  	 Getting our first Hello World displayed on the frontend  	 The overall structure of where files should go and what structure to use  	 How all the files of the module are put together and what each of them does  	 Extending the result into a brand management module  	 Displaying the managed results data on the frontend of our    Magento installation  We'll start by assembling the basic structure and the files needed to get a Hello  World message displayed and proceed ahead to upgrading the module to bring in  additional elements. These will include an administration panel and dynamic output  to Magento. It will also include giving the module its own unique URL within the  installation. It provides our module with a dynamic frontend, using which visitors  can browse through the data that is managed in the backend.   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  Creating our first Hello World message We'll start with a quick Hello World via a display block. This process is more  complex than displaying a message directly, but it shows us the fundamentals of  what we'll be trying to achieve in this chapter. With the exception of simply typing  Hello World in an existing template block, this is the quickest way of getting our  own template block into Magento's display system.  Setting up the display template We'll start the process by setting up the template itself with our Hello world  statement inside of it.  First, we'll create the directory  app design frontend default default  template hello  and create place the file world.phtml within it. Hence, the full  address should be  app design frontend default default template hello  world.phtml.  Next, we'll insert our Hello World text within the file:   Hello World!   We've placed an   tag on either side of the statement so that it stands out  on screen.  Placing the display template in a layout   .xml file Now that we have our display template, we need to ensure that the layout block  appears on a layout .xml file, so that it can be output on the site.  We'll place the following block of code in the layout .xml file of our choice:  <block type="core template" name="helloworld" template="hello world. phtml"  >  For example, we'll take the core.xml file, which contains the following by default:                    <block name="formkey" type="core template" template="core  formkey.phtml"  >          [ 118 ]   Chapter 7  Let's place our layout block within the XML file and ensure that it appears correctly  within the reference name in our layout, in the right-hand column:                    <block name="formkey" type="core template" template="core  formkey.phtml"  >                 <block type="core template" name="helloworld" template="hello  world.phtml"  >                  After we've saved these files, our Hello world! message will be displayed in the right  sidebar, as shown below:  As we can see, the Hello world! message is displayed between Compare Products  and BACK TO SCHOOL advertisement.  [ 119 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  Creating our first  helloworld  URL   structure Another step into Magento module development is to create a complete module that  becomes a section of the site via having a URL of its own. We're now going to create  one of these modules to get ourselves a  helloworld  URL structure and a section  of the site dedicated to our created module.  First, we need to put together the module's structure before adding the URL. This is  so that we're set-up going forward. Should you want to just have the URL for your  module, you only need to follow the last step of this section in the chapter.  The directory structure We'll create and set up folders to match the following directory structure in  preparation for putting together the module for the rest of this chapter.  The directories for the module's core files need to be set as follows:   	  app code local Book Helloworld   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	   Block   controllers   etc   Helper   Model   Mysql4   Helloworld   sql  helloworld_setup   template  helloworld   [ 120 ]  For the module's design template files:   	  app design frontend default default    Giving the module a backend Now that we have our directory structure in place, we'll need to create a configuration  file which makes sure that Magento can view our module in the system.  The file  app etc modules Book_Helloworld.xml should be created for our  module and should contain the following:  Chapter 7                       true         local               The module will now appear in the Disable Modules Output section under  System->Configuration, then Advanced under the left sub-menu. We can either  disable or enable this module through this menu.  Note: If the module does not appear on the page, then we'll need to clear the  Magento installation's cache. To do this, we should go to System->Cache  Management in our backend menu, select Disable from the drop-down to  the right of All Cache, and click Save cache settings.  Configuring the module Every module requires a config.xml file to set it up. In this case, we'll set up a very  basic version of the file  and nothing more  to get the module up and running. Later  on this file becomes very important in making the module dynamic and we'll extend  it much further than this base.  We'll create the file  app code local Book Helloworld etc config.xml and fill  it with the following:                                0.1.0                     [ 121 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel                         standard                               Book_Helloworld                 helloworld                                                                 helloworld.xml                                                         Book_Helloworld_Block                                       Book_Helloworld_Helper                       We'll break the code down and go through each tag individually.  We'll start by defining the   tag and the XML header for the file:       We'll follow it up with the declaration of our module and defining our module  version number:                       0.1.0               [ 122 ]   Opening the   tag, here we'll be setting up the module's URL; the    tag defines the URL, via which the module will be directly accessed. In  our example, we've used helloworld, as we want to achieve a  helloworld  setup.  Chapter 7                             standard                         Book_Helloworld               helloworld                           We'll continue inside the   tag to define the layout .xml file attached  to this module. These are the XML blocks that will be processed once the module  is accessed directly via the frontName value we set in the tag above. In this case,  when  helloworld  is accessed by a user, the layout .xml file will be accessed to get  module-specific blocks to load. This is followed by the closing of the   tag,  as it concludes our module's frontend configuration tags.                                     helloworld.xml                               The module's display block models are next. Here, we're declaring that this module  has a display block model class, which lets us use this model as display block types  in Magento's .xml layout files.                             Book_Helloworld_Block                 [ 123 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  Continuing with the   tag, we'll define our Helper model for the module,  so that it is available to the blocks when they are used. This is then followed by the  closing of the module's   tag:                         Book_Helloworld_Helper                     We'll close the   tag to end the file and that finishes everything:     We now have a config.xml file for our module.  Our controller The module's controller will take in the direct URL and process the layout attached  to it. Later on it will be responsible for loading the data to the index of our module,  when accessed via  helloworld . At the moment however, it will load just the    tag from our layout. .xml file  which we'll set up later .  We'll create the file  app code local Book Helloworld controllers  IndexController.php and fill it with the following:  <?php class Book_Helloworld_IndexController extends Mage_Core_Controller_ Front_Action {   public function indexAction     {     $this->loadLayout  ;     $this->renderLayout  ;   } }  There are two core functions to this controller: the first loads the module's layout  .xml file and processes it:  $this->loadLayout  ;  The second function renders this layout using the blocks defined in the layout   .xml file and outputs it:  $this->renderLayout  ;  [ 124 ]   Chapter 7  The Helper model Not every module uses a Helper model, but we'll be working on one anyway  for  illustrating this chapter . We'll be learning about the best practices for using them  in our module. Typically, a Helper model will be utilized for its helper functions,  which are used for formatting or altering output in some way. Examples of that are  as follows:   	 Number formatting  currency, number rounding into thousands   	 Alternative row color class outputting  We'll create the file  app code local Book Helloworld Helper Data.php and  place the following code within it:  <?php  <?php  class Book_Helloworld_Helper_Data extends Mage_Core_Helper_Abstract { }  At the moment the file is empty in order to set it up for later editing. We will place a  function or two in the Helper model later for usage.  The module's default model All modules have a default model that is attached to them. The default model  is responsible for fetching the data and or setting it up for the module's design  template files to process through. It is called when we declare a block, for example  type=hello world on a display block would call the world function inside the  Hello model.  We'll create the file  app code local Book Helloworld Model Helloworld.php  and place the following code within it:  class Book_Helloworld_Model_Helloworld extends Mage_Core_Model_ Abstract {   public function _construct     {     parent::_construct  ;     $this->_init 'helloworld helloworld' ;   } }  [ 125 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  This sets up the model for the module and initializes the model's functions for usage  in any template .xml file once we have some blocks.  Template blocks and display Now we'll need to create the frontend for our module and make sure that Magento  has something to output, when our module's chosen URL  helloworld  is accessed  by a user.  Display block class This holds the functions for the display block to refer to and is needed for our  template .xml file to pass the messages across.  We'll create the file  app code local Book Helloworld Block Helloworld.php  and place within it the following:  <?php class Book_Helloworld_Block_Helloworld extends Mage_Core_Block_ Template {   public function _prepareLayout     {     return parent::_prepareLayout  ;   }   public function getHelloworld     {     return 'Hello world';   } }  We can see that we have a getHelloworld function, which will return the Hello  world! message to our template file.  The layout .xml file Our module needs a dedicated layout .xml file, in order to load the display blocks  for our module when it is accessed.  For that, we'll create the file  app design frontend default default layout  helloworld.xml and place the following within it:                      <block type="helloworld helloworld" name="helloworld"           template="helloworld helloworld.phtml"  >  [ 126 ]   Chapter 7               The design template file Finally, we have our design template file which will be used for formatting the  output from the display block model.  We'll create  app design frontend default default template Helloworld  helloworld.phtml and place the following inside it:    getHelloworld  ; ?>   This will return the getHelloWorld   function from our display block between a  pair of   tags.  Viewing  helloworld  Now that we've put everything together that's required, we have our first display  block powered Hello World!. Accessing  helloworld  displays something along  the lines of the following, depending on our theme:  [ 127 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  Taking a look at what we've put together Let's go over all the work that we've just done to create this module and get to   this point.  We have created:   	 A directory system that holds our module and all its files  	 A system configuration file to declare our module to the system  	 A module configuration file to declare our module's configuration  	 A controller which processes the request when the user loads  helloworld   	 A default model  	 A helper for functions to help out with formatting in display templates  	 A display block for passing the message to our template file  	 A template file for echoing out our Hello world! message  	 A layout .xml file dedicated to just this module's display blocks under   the URL  helloworld   Using the Module Creator script to get  Hello World We'll now go through an automated method of creating a module with backend  administration. This will show us how to quickly deploy a base of a fully featured  module in the future. After doing that, we'll go through this code to understand how  it all works individually.  We can find the Module Creator available as an extension  on Magento Connect at the following link: http:  www. magentocommerce.com extension 1108 modulecreator.  Credit for the Module Creator script goes to Daniel Nitz, with  the example templates being created by Alistek.  [ 128 ]   This script allows us to put together a solid base of required files for our modules,  without having to manually create each file. It saves some time when creating all the  individual files and all developers should know about this when getting into regular  module development for Magento. While it's not a substitute for knowing how to  put together the modules ourselves, it does help when we need to get a module up  and running quickly  most useful when we need a base with which to expand into  what we want to build .  Chapter 7  Installing the Module Creator The following sequence is to be followed when installing the Module Creator:  1.  We'll get started by going to the extension page on Magento Connect for   the Module Creator and grabbing the key for this extension.  2.  Next, we'll insert the extension key from the Module Creator Magento   Connect extension page at: http:  www.magentocommerce.com  extension 1108 modulecreator.  3.  We'll open  downloader  into the input box  at the top of the page  and   copy and paste the extension key into the input box at the top of the page.  4.  We'll proceed by clicking Install to install the module into our   Magento installation.  A success message  similar to the one shown in the previous screenshot  is displayed.  [ 129 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  Creating our first module with the Module  Creator We'll start by loading the  moduleCreator  in our Magento installation's URL in  the browser. A default first screen is displayed, now that it's installed:  When we log in with the Magento administrative credentials, we'll find ourselves  inside the script of the Module Creator, and the functionality screen will unveil  itself. It will look similar to the following screenshot:  [ 130 ]   Chapter 7  All options are available to us in this initial screen, along with installed skeleton  module templates  with scripts . These can be loaded individually if we want to  install more later for rapid deployment. We can also develop a Skeleton Template  on our own, in future. We'll be using a Blank News Module, which is the default available module with  the Module Creator extension. It's important to note that the Magento Root Directory field is relevant to the  current location of the Module Creator directory. If the Module Creator is located  at http:  example.com moduleCreator  and our Magento installation is located   at http:  example.com , then we can simply insert ..  as the value for this field  and it will work. In most cases, the correct value of this field should insert itself  automatically into the input field, so that we do not have to figure out the correct  path ourselves.  As we'll be using the default theme for easier display throughout this book, it's  advisable to leave the two design fields blank. If we use this Module Creator in   our installation with our own theme, these fields will need to be filled in.  For this chapter we'll be using the following:  Field Namespace Module Magento Root Directory Design Design  Value Book Helloworld ..   Next we'll click on Create, and the following message gets displayed: New Module successfully created! Go to the folder where this file is located. You'll find a new folder called new. Within are all required files for your new module. This folder has the same structure  as your Magento installation. Just make sure you replace the interface and theme  folder with your current design path. If you want to add custom DB-fields go to   new local Book Helloworld sql module_setup mysql4-install-0.1.0.php  and make your changes for line 12 to 14.  Copy  new Book_Helloworld.xml to  app etc modules . If you chose a  Magento install directory, all files can be found in their according directory.  Implement your module functionality and you're done!  [ 131 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  The contents of our new module The module will create a solid amount of files for us to start with. The Module  Creator would have installed the following files:   	 app etc modules Book_Helloworld.xml  	 app code local Book Helloworld Block Helloworld.php  	 app code local Book Helloworld controllers IndexController.php  	 app code local Book Helloworld etc config.xml  	 app code local Book Helloworld Model Helloworld.php  	 app code local Book Helloworld Model Mysql4 Helloworld.php  	 app code local Book Helloworld Model Mysql4 Helloworld    	 app code local Book Helloworld Model Status.php  	 app code local Book Helloworld sql helloworld_setup mysql4-   	 app design frontend default default layout helloworld.xml  	 app design frontend default default template helloworld   Collection.php  install-0.1.0.php  helloworld.phtml   	 app code local Book Helloworld Block Adminhtml Helloworld.php  	 app code local Book Helloworld Block Adminhtml Helloworld Edit.   	 app code local Book Helloworld Block Adminhtml Helloworld Grid.   	 app code local Book Helloworld Block Adminhtml Helloworld Edit    	 app code local Book Helloworld Block Adminhtml Helloworld Edit    	 app code local Book Helloworld Block Adminhtml Helloworld Edit   php  php  Form.php  Tabs.php  Tab Form.php   	 app code local Book Helloworld controllers Adminhtml   HelloworldController.php   	 app code local Book Helloworld Helper Data.php  	 app design adminhtml default default layout helloworld.xml  If we didn't choose a Magento Root Directory, we'll need to manually copy the files  to their chosen locations, rather than have the installer doing it. The Module Creator  will place all the files within a directory called  new  within our  moduleCreator   folder. If this is the case, then we'll need to copy the files into their duplicate root  folders. For example  moduleCreator new app etc modules  would go into   app etc modules  and we would need to match this structure throughout.  [ 132 ]   Hello World Now that we have our module's core files ready, we want to get a simple Hello  World message displayed. We'll start by opening: app design frontend default  default template helloworld helloworld.phtml.  Chapter 7  At the top of the file, we'll find the following:    __ 'Module List'  ?>   We'll change that to Hello World:    __ 'Hello World'  ?>   We'll save helloworld.phtml and then load  helloworld on our Magento  installation's installation URL; the following screenshot is displayed:  Now we have our Hello World using the Module Creator!  [ 133 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  Expanding our module further into a  database-driven, administrated brands  module We'll now take the development of our module further and create a database-driven  list of brands for a section of the site. This part of the chapter will teach us how  convert the pieces that we built at the start, into a fully functional module   within Magento.  Our module will do the following:   	 List a series of brands  	 Turn those brands into links, which clicked, show the brand's name and an   outline of the location and history of that brand   	 Store this data in a database table within the Magento database  	 Make it content manageable in the administration of Magento, including   adding, editing, and deleting items  Recreating the base For the sake of making it easier to progress through this chapter, we'll recreate what  we did at the start. This will help when we do not want to read everything that we've  previously gone through so far. Explanations of these code blocks are at the start of  the chapter.  After this, we will add to the base that we've already created earlier in the chapter  and  introduce a database setup and backend administration into the module.  The directory structure The directory structure for the module's core files is as follows:   	  app code local Book Brands   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   Block  controllers  etc  Model  Mysql4  Brands  sql  brands_setup   [ 134 ]   Chapter 7  For the module's design template files, we have:   	  app design frontend default default   	  	   template  brands   Enabling the module in the backend The file  app etc modules Book_Brands.xml will be created for our module  and it will contain the following:                       true         local               Our controller We'll create the file  app code local Book Brands controllers  IndexController.php and fill it with the following code:  <?php class Book_Brands_IndexController extends Mage_Core_Controller_Front_ Action {   public function indexAction     {     $this->loadLayout  ;     $this->renderLayout  ;   } }  [ 135 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel Configuring the module We'll create the file  app code local Book Brands etc config.xml and fill it  with the following code:                                0.1.0                                           standard                             Book_Brands               brands                                                                 brands.xml                                                         Book_Brands_Block                                       Book_Brands_Helper                       [ 136 ]   The Helper model We'll create the file  app code local Book Brands Helper Data.php and place  the following code within it:  Chapter 7  <?php  <?php  class Book_Brands_Helper_Data extends Mage_Core_Helper_Abstract { }  The module's default model For the default model, we'll create the file  app code local Book Brands Model  Brands.php and place the following code within it:  class Book_Brands_Model_Brands extends Mage_Core_Model_Abstract {   public function _construct     {     parent::_construct  ;     $this->_init 'brands brands' ;   } }  The module's frontend display base Here we'll put together the template blocks that form the display of this module.

The configuration .xml file We'll be editing the existing config.xml file to include our database configuration.  For shortening the code, existing template tags from the previous config.xml  file have been shortened with a ... separator in between them to show that they  are unedited.  We'll edit our config.xml file to include the following outside of the ... separators:               ...          [ 138 ]   Chapter 7      ...

[ 139 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  We'll go into the detail of how config.xml and what they do. Our   tag  introduces database specific models that require mySQL4 in order to operate. This is  why we're appending _mysql4 and _Mysql4 onto the end of the class names and a    tag in the code:                         Book_Brands_Model           brands_mysql4                           Book_Brands_Model_Mysql4                                     brands                                       The second block of code introduced into config.xml covers database resources and  what the module will use. This defines that the module has a setup file included that  needs to be executed and checked on update. We'll leverage Magento's core setup  and write and read database connection settings in order to access the database.                                     Book_Brands                                 core_setup                                                 core_write                                                 core_read                           [ 140 ]   The mySQL4 data models We'll create the directory and file  app code local Book Brands Model Mysql4  Brands.php and place the following code within it:  Chapter 7  <?php  <?php  class Book_BrandsModel_Mysql4_Brands extends Mage_Core_Model_Mysql4_ Abstract {   public function _construct     {        $this->_init 'brands brands', 'brands_id' ;   } }  Here we'll expand the core mySQL4 database class within Magento. The second value  in the function $this->_init   should match the Primary Key of our module's  database table.  We'll create the directory and file  app code local Book Brands Model Mysql4  Brands Collection.php and place within it the following code:  class Book_BrandsModel_Mysql4_Brands_Collection extends Mage_Core_ Model_Mysql4_Collection_Abstract {   public function _construct     {     $this->_init 'brands brands' ;   } }  Just like the previous class, we'll expand Magento's core mySQL classes here, this time  the mySQL Collection class that Magento uses to collect data from the database.  [ 141 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel Database setup and installation of the file In order for our module to store data in the Magento database, we'll need to set up  the database in which all the data will be kept, stored, and managed by our backend  within Magento.  We'll create the following directory and file  app code local Book Brands sql  brands_setup mysql4-install-0.1.0.php and place within it the following code:  <?php  $installer = $this; $installer->startSetup  ;  $installer->run "  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {$this->getTable 'brands' }; CREATE TABLE {$this->getTable 'brands' }     `brands_id` int 11  unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,   `brand_name` varchar 255  NOT NULL default '',   `brand_description` text NOT NULL default '',   `brand_location` varchar 255  NOT NULL default '',   `status` smallint 6  NOT NULL default '0',   `created_time` datetime NULL,   `update_time` datetime NULL,   PRIMARY KEY  `brands_id`    ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;     " ;  $installer->endSetup  ;  Let's run through the code that we've just put together here. We start by assigning  the variable $installer the current Magento parent class. Then we move onto  initializing the installation and calling the child function startSetup   to indicate  that the setup of the module is being started by the system:  $installer = $this; $installer->startSetup  ;  We then run the SQL contained within the run   function through the system. We'll  notice the inclusion of {$this->getTable 'brands' } in the SQL, which allows  us to insert the name of a module table  including any prefix that the Magento  installation may have . Any SQL query which is needed for the module later can be  included here.  $installer->run "   ...   " ;  [ 142 ]   Chapter 7  The file is then finished off with the endSetup   function to complete the install run  for the module:  $installer->endSetup  ;  Extending the module to include an  administration Now that we have our base and have extended it to include our database integration,  we'll take this a step further by including an administration. This is so that we can  add, edit, delete, and manage our module's information in the backend of Magento  prior to its display.  Adminhtml directories Let's start by adding a couple of directories into our base in which to place all the  files required to add in an administrative backend.  These are contained in  app code local Book Brands :  Block      Adminhtml                         Edit                   Tab  controllers      Adminhtml   Administrative display blocks Magento comes with classes and models for generating the administrative backend  for modules. This means that we can input the core information for the screens, and  the actual display of the data fields, grids, information, and buttons are output using  the currently selected adminhtml template in the system.  This automates the processes of paging, exporting data to CSV XML, filtering  data, and searching, thereby saving a lot of work in the development of modules. It  also provides a consistent user experience for the users of Magento. The all-round  consistency between the modules that users install and use for their Magento  installations is a phenomenal benefit provided by this automation.  [ 143 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  There are several parts to putting together the administration for this module, which  we're going to go over:   	  	  	  	  	   	  	   	  a core model, defining the administration to the system an add edit model, allowing records to be added or edited as needed a setup of the module's grid display, for the administrative home page  a class to declare the edit add record form a class to set the tabs positioned to the left of the edit add record form when  it is being used a class to declare fields used in the add edit record form that appears a controller to bring it all together and process accessed URLs for the module  in the backend the final editing of the config.xml to set up the administrative backend and  activate it for our module  While this may seem like a lot of work to get a backend for a module in Magento,   it's not as much as would be required for other e-commerce systems  which require  us to template every screen and action, as well as creating the models controllers for  our module .  This is also designed to show us everything that can be clubbed together in terms  of an administrative backend for our module in Magento. So, we may end up using  significantly less for simpler modules that we develop with administrative backends  in Magento.  Defining the core administrative backend to the  system To start with, we'll need a model which ensures that the administrative backend is  held together and appears in the first place. It also defines our sub-menu item and  the labels for the two core buttons on the administrative screen:   	 Brand manager  our sub-menu item   	 Add Brand  our Add New Record button   We'll create the file  app code local Book Brands Block Adminhtml Brands. php and place the following code inside it:  <?php  class Book_BrandsBlock_Adminhtml_Brands extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_ Widget_Grid_Container {  [ 144 ]   Chapter 7      public function __construct       {     $this->_controller = 'adminhtml_brands';     $this->_blockGroup = 'brands';     $this->_headerText = Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Item Manager' ;     $this->_addButtonLabel = Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Add Brand' ;     parent::__construct  ;     } }  Let's break up the key lines of this file to make sure everything is understood as we  move forward.  We'll start by extending the Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid_Container  class which is Magento's Grid class for displaying grids of information across the  backend. We'll also notice that this is used for managing products, orders, customers,  newsletter subscribers, and every other type of information that is displayed in a  grid in the backend.  class Book_Brands_Block_Adminhtml_Brands extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_ Widget_Grid_Container  Defining our controller and blockGroup to Magento's Grid Container class lets  Magento know what controller to look for to process this backend's URLs when  accessed. It also declares which folder to look into for the models and the container  that  we'll be creating to put together in this administrative backend. This is common  throughout the code for the administrative setup files.      $this->_controller = 'adminhtml_brands';     $this->_blockGroup = 'brands';  We'll finish off by defining our headerText which appears at the top of the index  page for the module's administrative backend and the text used for the Add Record  button label. This is the common declaration and setting of key labels in the  administrative backend and will be used throughout other templates and files in   this chapter.      $this->_headerText = Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Brands Manager' ;     $this->_addButtonLabel = Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Add Brand' ;  [ 145 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel Defining the add edit screens to the system The following model defines the add edit screens to the system and sets them up  for us.  We'll start by creating the file  app code local Book Brands Block Adminhtml  Brands Edit.php and place the following code inside it:  <?php  class Book_Brands_Block_Adminhtml_Brands_Edit extends Mage_Adminhtml_ Block_Widget_Form_Container {     public function __construct       {     parent::__construct  ;      $this->_objectId = 'id';     $this->_blockGroup = 'brands';     $this->_controller = 'adminhtml_brands';      $this->_updateButton 'save', 'label', Mage::helper 'brands' ->__  'Save Brand'  ;     $this->_updateButton 'delete', 'label', Mage::helper 'brands' ->__  'Delete Brand'  ;     }      public function getHeaderText       {     if  Mage::registry 'brands_data'  && Mage::registry 'brands_ data' ->getId     {       return Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ "Edit Brand '%s'", $this->html Escape Mage::registry 'brands_data' ->getTitle    ;     } else {       return Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Add Brand' ;     }     } }  Key lines in this code The line where we defined the objectId to the system, represents the URL key used  when the system outputs the  edit id 5  URL. When we change the value from id  to brand, we'll have the output of  edit brand 5 .  $this->_objectId = 'id';  [ 146 ]   Chapter 7  The getHeaderText   function is key in this model, as it provides a way of  switching between showing an Edit Brand label and an Add Brand label depending  which screen the user is currently accessing. This is important to understand if we  want to change this behavior in any way for our own module.    public function getHeaderText     {  If the _objectId set earlier appears in the URL, then we'll be on an Edit Brand page:      if  Mage::registry 'brands_data'  && Mage::registry 'brands_ data' ->getId     {       return Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ "Edit Brand '%s'", $this->html Escape Mage::registry 'brands_data' ->getTitle    ;  If not, the user will be adding a brand, so the Add Brand label is displayed:      } else {       return Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Add Brand' ;     }   }  The module's grid display declaration For this class, we'll define the data grid that is displayed when the user clicks on the  Manage Brands sub-menu item, under our module's administrative backend menu  item. Although there's a lot of code to look at, we'll go through it later.  We'll create the file  app code local Book Brands Block Adminhtml Brands  Grid.php and place the following code inside it:  <?php  class Book_Brands_Block_Adminhtml_Brands_Grid extends Mage_Adminhtml_ Block_Widget_Grid {   public function __construct     {       parent::__construct  ;       $this->setId 'brandsGrid' ;       $this->setDefaultSort 'brands_id' ;       $this->setDefaultDir 'ASC' ;       $this->setSaveParametersInSession true ;   }    protected function _prepareCollection     {       $collection = Mage::getModel 'brands brands' ->getCollection  ;       $this->setCollection $collection ;  [ 147 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel        return parent::_prepareCollection  ;   }    protected function _prepareColumns     {       $this->addColumn 'brands_id', array            'header'    => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'ID' ,           'align'     =>'right',           'width'     => '50px',           'index'     => 'brands_id',         ;        $this->addColumn 'title', array            'header'    => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Title' ,           'align'     =>'left',           'index'     => 'title',         ;       $this->addColumn 'status', array            'header'    => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Status' ,           'align'     => 'left',           'width'     => '80px',           'index'     => 'status',           'type'      => 'options',           'options'   => array                1 => 'Enabled',               2 => 'Disabled',            ,         ;          $this->addColumn 'action',             array                  'header'    =>  Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Action' ,                 'width'     => '100',                 'type'      => 'action',                 'getter'    => 'getId',                 'actions'   => array                      array                          'caption'   => Mage::helper                                         'brands' ->__ 'Edit' ,                         'url'       => array 'base'=> '* * edit' ,                         'field'     => 'id'                                        ,                 'filter'    => false,                 'sortable'  => false,                 'index'     => 'stores',  [ 148 ]   Chapter 7                  'is_system' => true,           ;        return parent::_prepareColumns  ;   }    public function getRowUrl $row    {       return $this->getUrl '* * edit', array 'id' => $row->getId    ;   }  }  There are four core parts to this model's code that we'll learn:  1.  The construct. 2.  The prepareCollection   function, which gathers data from   the database ready for display. 3.  Preparing the grid's columns. 4.  The getRowUrl   function.  The __construct   The __construct   function holds the core settings for the module's grid. It starts  off by defining the module's grid ID; this is used as an XHTML value applied to the  grid to give it a unique identifier. This is useful if we want to do anything with the  display by editing the Magento administrative stylesheet.  $this->setId 'brandsGrid' ;  We'll then move on to defining the default sorting key for the table. In this case, we'll  sort by the database table column brand_name. We'll set the direction of the order to  DESC, to make sure that the table records are always in alphabetical order by default.  $this->setDefaultSort 'brand_name' ; $this->setDefaultDir 'ASC' ;  The last variable that is set in the __construct   function defines whether or not  the user's custom filters and parameters applied to this grid should be saved in  their session, once they've changed the defaults. This ensures that they can filter by  another column, go to another page in the backend, and return with their filter and  ordering intact. If set to false, the module's grid page will always retain the default  settings set in the previous three settings in this function.  $this->setSaveParametersInSession true ;  [ 149 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel Preparing the columns In the __prepareColumns   function, we'll define the columns for display in the  grid. We'll define several properties for each field, including the label, which field  this label should be displaying, its width, alignment, field type, and  if an option  field  its options.  The status field is the best example of this, as it does everything at once:  $this->addColumn 'status', array    'header'    => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Status' ,   'align'     => 'left',   'width'     => '80px',   'index'     => 'status',   'type'  => 'options',   'options'   => array      1 => 'Active',     0 => 'Inactive',    ,   ;  The getRowUrl   function This function is used to set the URL for any row in the grid, when a user clicks when  hovering over a row. The * * edit defines that the module's namespace and name  will appear before the  edit  which will begin the URL. It will be then ended with  the $row->getId variable, to make sure that it forms a good  edit id 1 URL to be  passed to the system for ensuring that the user is editing the record with the ID 1.  public function getRowUrl $row      {     return $this->getUrl '* * edit', array 'id' => $row->getId    ;     }  Preparing the form This model defines the preparation of our form for loading. It declares the various  values of the form  id, action, and method  to the system following the conventions  previously outlined in other models.  We'll create the file  app code local Book Brands Block Adminhtml Brands  Edit Form.php and place the following code inside it:  <?php  class Book_Brands_Block_Adminhtml_Brands_Edit_Form extends Mage_ Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Form  [ 150 ]   Chapter 7  {     protected function _prepareForm       {     $form = new Varien_Data_Form array        'id' => 'edit_form',       'action' => $this->getUrl '* * save', array 'id' => $this- >getRequest  ->getParam 'id'   ,       'method' => 'post',              ;      $form->setUseContainer true ;     $this->setForm $form ;     return parent::_prepareForm  ;     } }  Defining the add edit form tabs This module is where the tabs positioned on the left of the form containing different  data are set up. In this case we'll only set up one tab, as we don't have enough fields  for them to be divided into multiple tabs.  We'll create the file  app code local Book Brands Block Adminhtml Brands  Edit Tabs.php and place the following code inside it:  <?php  class Book_Brands_Block_Adminhtml_Brands_Edit_Tabs extends Mage_ Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Tabs {   public function __construct     {     parent::__construct  ;     $this->setId 'brands_tabs' ;     $this->setDestElementId 'edit_form' ;     $this->setTitle Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Brand Information'  ;   }    protected function _beforeToHtml     {     $this->addTab 'form_section', array        'label'        'title'        'content'   => $this->getLayout  ->createBlock 'brands  adminhtml_brands_edit_tab_form' ->toHtml  ,       ;   => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Brand Information' ,  => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Brand Information' ,  [ 151 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel      return parent::_beforeToHtml  ;   } }  There are two key things going on here in this model. Firstly, in the __construct    function we'll be setting the edit_form as the default form and Brand Information  as the default title to show when a add edit form is shown:      $this->setId 'brands_tabs' ;     $this->setDestElementId 'edit_form' ;     $this->setTitle Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Brand Information'  ;  Secondly, in the beforeToHtml   function the actual adding of the tab to the form  takes place:      $this->addTab 'form_section', array        'label'        'title'        'content'   => $this->getLayout  ->createBlock 'brands  adminhtml_brands_edit_tab_form' ->toHtml  ,       ;   => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Brand Information' ,  => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Brand Information' ,  Here the label and title are both defined as Brand Information and we'll make sure  to block adminhtml_brands_edit_tab_form , as it's used for the tab's form. This  form is declared in the following class.  Configuring and preparing the form for display Following the tab being declared to show our form block, we'll need to create it. In  this model well' creating the form block to be displayed when the form tab we've just  declared in the previous file is clicked. We're setting up the fieldsets and fields that  are to be used for the form block that appears.  We'll create the file  app code local Book Brands Block Adminhtml Brands  Edit Tab Form.php and place the following code inside it:  <?php  class Book_Brands_Block_Adminhtml_Brands_Edit_Tab_Form extends Mage_ Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Form {   protected function _prepareForm     {     $form = new Varien_Data_Form  ;     $this->setForm $form ;  [ 152 ]       $fieldset = $form->addFieldset 'brands_form', array 'legend'=>Mage      ::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Brand information'   ;  Chapter 7      $fieldset->addField 'brand_name', 'text', array        'label'        'class'        'required'  => true,       'name'        ;   => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Brand Name' ,  => 'required-entry',    => 'brand_name',   => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Status' ,   => 'status',      $fieldset->addField 'status', 'select', array        'label'        'name'        'values'  => array          array            'value'            'label'           ,   => 1,  => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Active' ,   => 0,  => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Inactive' ,          array            'value'            'label'           ,        ,       ;      $fieldset->addField 'brand_location', 'text', array        'label'        'class'        'required'  => true,       'name'        ;   => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Location' ,  => 'required-entry',    => 'brand_location',      $fieldset->addField 'brand_description', 'editor', array        'name'        'label'        'title'        'style'        'wysiwyg'   => false,       'required'  => true,       ;    => 'brand_description',  => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Description' ,  => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Description' ,  => 'width:98%; height:400px;',      if   Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->getBrandsData         {       $form->setValues Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' -        >getBrandsData   ;       Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->setBrandsData null ;     } elseif   Mage::registry 'brands_data'    {  [ 153 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel        $form->setValues Mage::registry 'brands_data' ->getData   ;     }     return parent::_prepareForm  ;   } }  Three key things happen here. Firstly, we have the fieldset that is added at  the start:  $fieldset = $form->addFieldset 'brands_form',   array 'legend'=>Mage::helper 'brands' ->__ 'Brand Information'   ;  Without this, we can't place the fields anywhere. They need the defined $fieldset  variable in order to add themselves to the form.  Secondly, the fields are added, in a way remarkably similar to the way they were  added to the grid for display previously. We have the same options and a few  additional options such as class, which defines the class of the form field and  whether or not the field is required upon being input.  Lastly, we have some callback functions to the current session in progress to see if  they've already tried to fill in this form and failed, therefore needing to place their  information back in the form rather than the default:      if   Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->getBrandsData         {       $form->setValues Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' -        >getBrandsData   ;       Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->setBrandsData null ;     } elseif   Mage::registry 'brands_data'    {       $form->setValues Mage::registry 'brands_data' ->getData   ;     }  This function is an extremely useful function to have, in terms of usability and  consistency of user experience throughout the Magento administration.  Setting up our brand status array A standard across Magento modules and other manageable information in the  backend is to have statuses assigned to data. For this we'll need to create the file   app code local Book Brands Model Status.php and place the following code  inside it:  <?php  class Book_Brands_Model_Status extends Varien_Object {  [ 154 ]   Chapter 7      const STATUS_ENABLED      const STATUS_DISABLED   = 1; = 2;      static public function getOptionArray       {         return array              self::STATUS_ENABLED    => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__              'Enabled' ,             self::STATUS_DISABLED   => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__              'Disabled'           ;     } }  Let's break this down briefly to go over what we've just done.  To start with, we have two constants being declared to define the stored database  variables with which Magento will refer to these statuses internally:  const STATUS_ENABLED = 1; const STATUS_DISABLED = 2;  After this comes our getOptionArray   function which defines our array of status  options that we will implement for our module and their variables:  static public function getOptionArray       {         return array              self::STATUS_ENABLED    => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__  'Enabled' ,             self::STATUS_DISABLED   => Mage::helper 'brands' ->__  'Disabled'           ;     }  This passes an array of the following to Magento for our status array:  Value 1 2  Label Enabled Disabled  [ 155 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel Creating a controller to process access URLs This controller file will process all the URLs, as they're accessed in the backend.  We'll see everything split into functions set up as  Action. For example,   module index  will be set up as indexAction   and the rest follow the same  naming convention.  The code inside this file controls the core actions for these individual URLs and   sets the individual pages up for loading.  We'll create the file  app code local Book Brands controllers Adminhtml  BrandsController.php and place the following code inside it:  <?php  class Book_Brands_Adminhtml_BrandsController extends Mage_Adminhtml_ Controller_action {   protected function _initAction     {     $this->loadLayout       ->_setActiveMenu 'brands items'      ->_addBreadcrumb Mage::helper 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brands Manager' ,  Mage::helper 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brands Manager'  ;     return $this;   }    public function indexAction   {     $this->_initAction  ;     $this->renderLayout  ;   }    public function editAction     {     $brandsId      $brandsModel = Mage::getModel 'brands brands' ->load $brandsId ;   = $this->getRequest  ->getParam 'id' ;      if  $brandsModel->getId    $brandsId == 0  {       Mage::register 'brands_data', $brandsModel ;        $this->loadLayout  ;       $this->_setActiveMenu 'brands items' ;        $this->_addBreadcrumb Mage::helper 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brands  Manager' , Mage::helper 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brands Manager'  ;       $this->_addBreadcrumb Mage::helper 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brand  Description' , Mage::helper 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brand Description'  ;        $this->getLayout  ->getBlock 'head' ->setCanLoadExtJs true ;  [ 156 ]   Chapter 7        $this->_addContent $this->getLayout  ->createBlock 'brands  adminhtml_brands_edit'            ->_addLeft $this->getLayout  ->createBlock 'brands adminhtml_ brands_edit_tabs'  ;        $this->renderLayout  ;     } else {       Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->addError Mage::helper ' brands' ->__ 'Brand does not exist'  ;       $this->_redirect '* * ' ;     }   }    public function newAction     {     $this->_forward 'edit' ;   }    public function saveAction     {     if   $this->getRequest  ->getPost     {       try {         $postData = $this->getRequest  ->getPost  ;         $brandsModel = Mage::getModel 'brands brands' ;   if  $this->getRequest  ->getParam 'id'  <= 0     date' ->gmtDate   ;         $brandsModel->setCreatedTime Mage::getSingleton 'core         $brandsModel         >gmtDate                  ->addData $postData  ->setUpdateTime Mage::getSingleton 'core date' -  ->setId $this->getRequest  ->getParam 'id'   ->save  ;          Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->addSuccess Mage::help er 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brand was successfully saved'  ;         Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->setBrandsData false ;          $this->_redirect '* * ' ;         return;       } catch  Exception $e  {         Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->addError $e- >getMessage   ;         Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' - >set Data $this->getRequest  ->getPost   ;         $this->_redirect '* * edit', array 'id' => $this- >getRequest  ->getParam 'id'   ;         return;  [ 157 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel        }     }     $this->_redirect '* * ' ;   }    public function deleteAction     {     if  $this->getRequest  ->getParam 'id'  > 0   {       try {         $brandsModel = Mage::getModel 'brands brands' ;          $brandsModel->setId $this->getRequest  ->getParam 'id'             ->delete  ;          Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->addSuccess Mage::help er 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brand was successfully deleted'  ;         $this->_redirect '* * ' ;       } catch  Exception $e  {         Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->addError $e- >getMessage   ;         $this->_redirect '* * edit', array 'id' => $this- >getRequest  ->getParam 'id'   ;       }     }     $this->_redirect '* * ' ;   } }  Let's break down the code and go through it so that you understand what we've just  done in this file.  We start out by declaring our BrandsController class that will hold the admin  together.  class Book_Brands_Adminhtml_BrandsController extends Mage_Adminhtml_ Controller_action  <?php  {  Our first function is _initAction   which sets the brands brands manager as  active in the menu handler in the backend of Magento as well as setting the  breadcrumb trail.    protected function _initAction     {     $this->loadLayout       ->_setActiveMenu 'brands items'   [ 158 ]       ->_addBreadcrumb Mage::helper 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brands Manager' ,  Mage::helper 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brands Manager'  ;     return $this;   }  Our indexAction   function calls our _initAction   function to start and then  renders the layout.   Chapter 7    public function indexAction   {     $this->_initAction  ;     $this->renderLayout  ;   }  Next we're putting actions to our edit function.     public function editAction     {  We grab the get parameter ID and use it to load the brand in our database by   that ID.       $brandsId      $brandsModel = Mage::getModel 'brands brands' ->load $brandsId ;   = $this->getRequest  ->getParam 'id' ;  If there's a brand by that ID we're going to set brands_data in the Magento  global registry.       if  $brandsModel->getId    $brandsId == 0  {       Mage::register 'brands_data', $brandsModel ;  Followed by the initializing of the loading for the page layout and setting of the  active brand navigation item. We'll then make sure we can load the extra functions in  the JavaScript library should we need them.         $this->_initAction  ;        $this->_addBreadcrumb Mage::helper 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brand  Description' , Mage::helper 'adminhtml' ->__ 'Brand Description'  ;        $this->getLayout  ->getBlock 'head' ->setCanLoadExtJs true ;  The following loads our content for the page which will load the edit form and any  tabs that will appear in the left sided navigation of the edit page.        $this->_addContent $this->getLayout  ->createBlock 'brands  adminhtml_brands_edit'            ->_addLeft $this->getLayout  ->createBlock 'brands adminhtml_ brands_edit_tabs'  ;        $this->renderLayout  ;  [ 159 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  If the brand doesn't exist, show an error box with the contents Brand does not exist  and redirect to the brands index.      } else {       Mage::getSingleton 'adminhtml session' ->addError Mage::helper ' brands' ->__ 'Brand does not exist'  ;       $this->_redirect '* * ' ;     }   }  Our newAction   will handle a new brand being inserted. It will call the  editAction   function and load the form as a new brand instead of one being edited.    public function newAction     {     $this->_forward 'edit' ;   }    public function saveAction     {  The saveAction   function will be called once the edit form is posted.  We'll check if posted information exists, and if it goes grab it and the brand  controller module to interface with brand information going forward.      if   $this->getRequest  ->getPost     {       try {         $postData = $this->getRequest  ->getPost  ;         $brandsModel = Mage::getModel 'brands brands' ;  If we have a brand ID we'll set the record created time to attach to our database entry  for the saved brand once inserted.   if  $this->getRequest  ->getParam 'id'  <= 0     date' ->gmtDate   ;         $brandsModel->setCreatedTime Mage::getSingleton 'core   Followed by the inserting of the brand into the database.         $brandsModel         >gmtDate                  ->addData $postData  ->setUpdateTime Mage::getSingleton 'core date' -  ->setId $this->getRequest  ->getParam 'id'   ->save  ;  [ 160 ]   We then set a success message, remove the saved brand data in the Magento registry  and redirect to the brands information index.

Changing the module's config.xml to reflect the  administrative backend Now that we have all our files together for the complete backend administrative  display of our module, we'll need to define these blocks and actions in our module's  config.xml file. As we used the separator to define tags that remain unchanged to  cut down the amount of repeated code.  We'll open  app code local Book Brands etc config.xml and make the  following additions:                    ...                     ...                                        admin                       Book_Brands             brands                     [ 162 ]   Chapter 7                                               Brands           71                                                    Manage Brands               0               brands adminhtml_brands                                                                         Allow Everything                                                               Brands Module                 10                                                                                       brands.xml                                                     ...          [ 163 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  We'll break down the additions to our config.xml file so that they once again make  sense as we proceed forward.  The first part defines that we have a controller to handle the URLs in the backend:                                     admin                           Book_Brands               brands                                       We then have a starting   block tag, which brings in three groups  of configuration options to the file, the first of which defines our menu to the  administrative backend. It defines the title of the menu item, the sort order  when  it should appear in the order of the main menu items , and the sole sub-item in the  menu  referred to as children . We'll call it Manage Brands:                         Brands           71                                                    Manage Brands               0               brands adminhtml_brands                                       The second of the   block tag group defines permissions for our module.  It defines which resources should be made available as options to select in the  permissions section of setting up a user and what it should allow them access to  in the administrative backend. Here we've defined an Allow Everything resource  group which allows complete access to do anything in our module to the user or user  group given the permission:                                     Allow Everything   [ 164 ]   Chapter 7                                                               Brands Module                 10                                                                                        brands.xml                           The third and last set of tags in the new   block tag of configuration  options defines the layout .xml file, which provides the display blocks for processing  when the URLs are accessed:  This layout .xml file is going to be created next in our process.  Giving our administrative backend a layout .xml file Just like on the front end, we'll need to create a layout .xml file for our adminhtml  files defined for Magento. This pulls everything together and ensures that everything  loads properly.  We'll create the file  app design adminhtml default default layout brands. xml and place the following inside of it:                                     [ 165 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  This will ensure that when we access our module in the backend, it loads as it   should through the controller that we created for it earlier and along with all  subsequent files.  With the addition of this file, we have ourselves a fully active administrative backend  for our module that connects with the database table that we put together earlier.  A look at the administrative backend Let's take a minute or two to admire what the backend looks like, now that we've put  it together and everything is in the system.  In the following screenshot, we'll look at the data display grid:  The Add Brand form is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 166 ]   The final stage in this process is making sure all the information from the backend  administrative component can output on the frontend of the system, when the URL  is accessed. This is done by editing the display block models and template files that  we setup earlier in the chapter for both, brands list, and a singular brand view. Here  we can use the data that we've put together as needed.  Let's look back at the fields that we set up for our module:  Chapter 7   	 brand_id  	 brand_name  	 brand_description  	 brand_location  	 status  	 updated_time  	 created_time  For our purpose, we'll set up the following:  1.  An index loading function, which lists all  active status  brands in the   database and when they were last updated.  2.  A singular brand loading function, which lists all information that we have   on the individual brand being viewed.  The index controller To start off, we need to ensure that we load the data correctly on the core index and  also while viewing the individual brand's page. Here we'll make sure that the data is  loaded for it to be used in our template files on the frontend.  We'll open and edit  app code local Book Brands controllers  IndexController.php file and make sure it looks like the following:  <?php class Book_Brands_IndexController extends Mage_Core_Controller_Front_ Action {   public function indexAction     {     $brands_id = $this->getRequest  ->getParam 'id' ;        if $brands_id != null && $brands_id != ''  {       $brands = Mage::getModel 'brands brands' ->load $brands_id - >getData  ;  [ 167 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel      } else {       $brands = null;     }            if $brands == null  {       $resource = Mage::getSingleton 'core resource' ;       $read= $resource->getConnection 'core_read' ;       $brandsTable = $resource->getTableName 'brands' ;              $select = $read->select           ->from $brandsTable,array 'brands_id','brand_          description','brand_location','status'           ->where 'status', 1          ->order 'created_time DESC'  ;                $brands = $read->fetchRow $select ;     }     Mage::register 'brands', $brands ;  $this->loadLayout  ;     $this->renderLayout  ;   } }  Let's go through these edits to make sure that everything is clear.   First off, we'll start by assigning $brand the value of $_GET['id']. We'll use this  function, as it filters out any cross-site scripting and to eliminate the bad things that  can happen to the raw variable, when we use it as we please.  $brands_id = $this->getRequest  ->getParam 'id' ;  If this value isn't blank  that is, if we're looking at a singular brand's page , then we'll  call the load   function from our brands data model. If not, then we set $brands to  null for the next bulk of the code that follows.  if $brands_id != null && $brands_id != ''  { $brands = Mage::getModel 'brands brands' ->load $brands_id - >getData  ; }  else {     $brands = null; }  If $brands == null, then this means that we're not looking at an individual brand  page and are looking at the index, which needs to list them all.  if $brands == null {  [ 168 ]   Chapter 7  We'll assign the database functions to the variable $resource and make sure that  we use the core_read database setup and assigning the brands table name to the  variable $brandsTable.  $resource = Mage::getSingleton 'core resource' ;   $read= $resource->getConnection 'core_read' ;   $brandsTable = $resource->getTableName 'brands' ;  Now we will build the query needed to obtain all brands from the table where  status = 1 ordered by the newest created to oldest entries in the table. Status 1  means Enabled in this case.    $select = $read->select       -> from $brandsTable,array 'brands_id','brand_description','brand_      location','status'       ->where 'status',1      ->order 'created_time DESC'  ;              $brands = $read->fetchRow $select ;   }  To finish off, $brands, which is now set to either a group of all the brands or a  singular brand, is now registered as a variable which can be accessed across the  module further on:    Mage::register 'brands', $brands ;  Displaying the brands data To display the data that we've set by editing our index controller, we'll open and  make edits to the module's template file located at the address  app design  frontend default default templates brands brands.phtml. Here's the file  after the edits are made:  <?php $brands = $this->getBrands  ; if   count $brands  > 0    {   foreach   $brands as $brand   :     echo '  getUrl 'brands?id='.$brand['brand_      id'] .'">Name: '.$brand['title'].'  ';     echo '  Location: '.$brand['location'].'  ';     echo ' Desciption: '.$brand['brand_description'].'  ';   endforeach; } else  [ 169 ]   Fully-Featured Module for Magento with Admin Panel  {   print 'We don\'t have any brands here right now. Please try again  later.'; }  We'll go through this code step by step.  We start off by assigning the brands  if we're on the index  or brand  if we use  ?id=  on the end of the URL  to the variable $brands.  $brands = $this->getBrands  ;  We then need to make sure that this is an array. If it isn't, then our data model tells  us that the result is not found.  if  count $brands >0  {  If we have a result inside our array  or multiple results , then we go through them   in a foreach loop and echo out simple formatting to display them on the site:  foreach   $brands as $brand   :     echo '  getUrl 'brands?id='.$brand['brand_      id'] .'">Name: '.$brand['title'].'  ';     echo '  Location: '.$brand['location'].'  ';     echo ' Desciption: '.$brand['brand_description'].'  ';   endforeach;  However, if we don't have a result inside the array, we'll display a simple message  to the person visiting the page that we don't have any brands just yet and that they  need to come back a little bit later.  } else {   print 'We don\'t have any brands here right now. Please try again  later.'; }  There we go, we have our module's data displaying on the frontend! If we follow  all the steps in this chapter, then our brand data display will look as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 170 ]   Chapter 7  Summary In this chapter, we've covered the basics of creating an advanced module for  Magento.

In some cases, it's the other the way around, and we would like to add Magento's  e-commerce functionality to our chosen content management system.  In this chapter we'll go over a few of the content management system integration  options available, while focusing on WordPress. We will learn the following:  Installing the WordPress extension   	  	 Configuring the WordPress extension  	 Configuring Magento's display of the WordPress extension  	 Changing the look and display of your templates for the WordPress   integration   	 Which other third party CMS integration packages and extensions    for ExpressionEngine, Drupal, Typo3, and Joomla! are available  Notable things about CMS Integration We must ensure that we back up both our Magento installation and our CMS  installation before editing them. Sometimes, the core files are to be edited, and so  we'll need to keep a backup of the original version of the files before editing them.  Keeping a copy of the database is also advisable.   Integration of Third-Party CMS  It's also advisable to back up the files with changes intact after finishing the  integration, in case an upgrade of either system knocks the integration out of sync.  The WYSIWYG editor implementation If we simply want to implement a WYSIWYG editor into our Magento install,  there are two available modules that can be installed to integrate this functionality  available at the following URLs:  http:  www.magentocommerce.com extension 586 fontis-wysiwyg-editor.  http:  www.magentocommerce.com extension 1426 bouncingorange-tinymce- wysiwyg.  Integrating Wordpress In this section, we'll learn about integrating Wordpress with Magento.  WordPress is an entirely open source, free system available for download  by anyone who can navigate to http:  wordpress.org download .  Initially built to be a small content management system based around  improving typography, WordPress has grown to power hundreds and  thousands of blogs worldwide and is the biggest self-hosted blogging tool  available on the web today.  Here, we'll install a popular available module by the name of Lazzymonks, a  WordPress integration from Magento Connect for integrating WordPress into  Magento. It enables the viewing of blog posts and pages within the Magento   layout, as well as a sidebar block being included in the module for archives,  categories, and RSS feed links to be shown to the users.  [ 174 ]   Chapter 8  Installation To install the WordPress integration module, we need to make sure that both  Magento and WordPress are installed in the same database; otherwise, the module  will not work.  Before we start, it must be ensured that our preferred state setting is set to beta,  as this module is currently marked as, in beta development. This can be found under  the settings tab whilst within the downloader. We must also ensure that our WordPress installation is installed in a folder named    wordpress  in our root Magento installation folder. This is also vital as the  extension does not look for any other folder and is currently not configurable to look  for folders not named  wordpress .  The module that we'll be installing is located at: http:  www.magentocommerce. com extension 296 lazzymonks-wordpress-integration.  Once we find and load the page for the Lazzymonks Wordpress Integration plugin  we click on the Get extension key button  shown in the previous screenshot  to  unveil the extension key for the module. We have to make sure to copy the extension  key from the input area for the next step. Next, we load up our Magento Connect downloader located at  downloader  from  our root installation address or System->Downloader in the Magento administration  menu. Once we have logged into the downloader, we paste the extension key into the  text input located under Install New Extensions, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 175 ]   Integration of Third-Party CMS  The install should be relatively quick:  We open index.php from our Magento installation folder and find the line:  require_once $mageFilename;  Next, we place the following code after the above code:  define 'WP_USE_THEMES', true ; require '. wordpress wp-blog-header.php' ;  We must make sure that the second line here points to our WordPress installation,  otherwise this will break.  After that, we open  wordpress wp-settings.php. We will need to find and  remove the & symbol from the code. This is to make the code compatible with  Magento. The line numbers are placed for a quick reference, roughly related to the  latest version of WordPress:  Line 520:  Line 535:  Line 524:  Line 578:  $wp_the_query =& new WP_Query  ;  $wp_rewrite =& new WP_Rewrite  ;  $wp =& new WP  ;  $wp_locale =& new WP_Locale  ;  Next, we find the following and comment it out  around Line 583 :     Escape with wpdb. $_GET    = add_magic_quotes $_GET    ; $_POST   = add_magic_quotes $_POST   ; $_COOKIE = add_magic_quotes $_COOKIE ; $_SERVER = add_magic_quotes $_SERVER ;  [ 176 ]   Chapter 8  This results in the following:     Escape with wpdb.   $_GET    = add_magic_quotes $_GET    ;   $_POST   = add_magic_quotes $_POST   ;   $_COOKIE = add_magic_quotes $_COOKIE ;   $_SERVER = add_magic_quotes $_SERVER ;  We'll keep them in  rather than removing them , so that it is easier to reverse the  changes later if we need to  if we're uninstalling .  Now, we open wordpress wp-includes l10n.php and find the following  in  WordPress 2.7.1, on Line 112 :   function __ $text, $domain = 'default'  { return translate $text, $domain ; }  Next, we replace this block of code with the following to allow Magento's translate  function to operate, where necessary:  if  !function_exists '__'   { function __ $text, $domain = 'default'  { return translate $text, $domain ; } }  That's all for the code edits needed for installation. After we have done this, we  will take the magento folder from within  wordpress_module_files Wordpress- theme  and place it within our  wordpress wp-content themes  Wordpress  themes folder. This will give WordPress a theme called Magento, which allows us to  interface with the Magento installation.  [ 177 ]   Integration of Third-Party CMS  Next, we log into our WordPress administration and go to Appearance->Themes,  where we'll see the Magento theme that is now available:  We click the title to pop up the theme preview and activate it. If we navigate   to  wordpress  directly, we will receive a blank page. We go to Settings->General and change our WordPress URL to our Magento  installation URL  blog . For example, this means that if our Magento installation  is at http:  localhost magento , then our WordPress URL would be  http:  localhost magento blog.  We must make sure to save and then head over to Settings->Permalinks. It must be  ensured that the Permalinks are set to Default and turned off entirely; otherwise,  this will affect our Magento WordPress integration. Hopefully better Permalinks  will be implemented in a future version of this module.  [ 178 ]   When we navigate to our newly set WordPress URL, we will see our newly  integrated WordPress blog within our store, as shown below:  Chapter 8  We will also see the blog sidebar block included by default on the right-hand side of  our layout:  [ 179 ]   Integration of Third-Party CMS  Configuration Once the install process has finished, we head to our Magento administration system  and to System->Configuration. We will now see a Blog sub-menu that controls our  WordPress integration settings for this plugin.  Under this new menu item, we will find all our configuration options for integration  that the extension allows within Magento:  [ 180 ]   Let's browse through the configuration values so that we could understand what  each configuration value does.  Chapter 8  WordPress Blog Settings  Configuration value Enable WordPress Blog  Require Login To View  Require Login To  Comment Page Title  Enable Footer Link  Page Layout  What it does Enables or disables  blog  from working Requires log in to the Magento user system to view the  blog, allows for private member news Requires log in to the Magento user system to comment on  the blog Changes the page title when a user is accessing the blog  URL on our Magento installation Puts the blog automatically into the footer links menu to be  dynamically output if we call the function Decides which Magento page template to use when  showing the blog  WordPress Blog Menu The following table illustrates the configuration values of a blog menu and what   they do:  Configuration value Require Login To Show Menu  Enable Left Menu  Enable Right Menu  Enable Archive Descriptions  Enable RSS links  What it does Decides whether or not to show the sidebar to  logged out members of our Magento installation. Determines whether or not the blog sidebar block  shows in the left menu  when available  Determines whether or not the blog sidebar block  shows in the right menu  when available  If enabled, the user will see a statement similar  to the following in the blog sidebar block, when  browsing a blog archive on the site: You are  currently browsing the blog archives for May,  2009 Determines whether or not to show the links to  your blog's RSS feeds in the blog sidebar block. If  disabled, they disappear  [ 181 ]   Integration of Third-Party CMS  It's advisable to configure these options  the way we need them now, rather than  later  to make sure that everything is set up before we start tweaking the display.  Doing so will display the following message:stop you have to come back later on. If we're going to use widgets in our sidebar, rather than editing the sidebar directly,  it's recommend to turn off Enable RSS links to ensure that we don't have anything  pre-appended to the sidebar widget output.  Changing the display of integration The extension contains base templates which can we change to alter the display  of the integration. Templates for the extension can be found in  app design  frontend default default template blog .  There are two templates in this directory for alteration:   	 blog.phtml—For alteration of the blog page template  	 menu.phtml—For alteration of the sidebar display  Page post layout The blog.phtml template doesn't consist of much display, only that of an if  elseif else statement to decide the template to be included. It does, however  contain the output for the message: You must be logged in to view the blog if  the option is enabled.  The actual templating of the blog post look and feel is done within the WordPress  theme and the magento.php template within the theme directory named magento  that we copied over earlier. Everything is templated the way a normal WordPress  theme would be, besides the fact that we don't call get_header  , get_sidebar  ,  or get_footer   in our templates.  The default magento.php template also uses  , which  must stay at the top of the file no matter what edits we put in place. This function  ensures compatibility with Magento and that no errors occur.  Sidebar The menu.phtml template consists of our sidebar block for display in our chosen  Magento sidebar, if its turned on. It contains the archive description messages, a  widgetized sidebar, and a non-widgetized sidebar.  This means that it will have a default display if we're not using widgets. However,   if we use widgets, then it will set a default set of content to display below the  widgets that we select.  [ 182 ]   Let's take this sidebar widget set up as an example; we've put the following   widgets into our sidebar under Appearance->Widgets under the WordPress  administration system:  Chapter 8   	 Pages  	 Links: Blogroll  	 Meta  	 Search  	 Recent Posts  The end result on both the WordPress configuration and the Magento display is  shown in the following screenshots:  [ 183 ]   Integration of Third-Party CMS  Here, we notice that the RSS feeds are automatically placed at the bottom as the  Enable RSS links option is set to Enabled within Magento. Otherwise, we have a  perfect display and control for our blog sidebar widget throughout the site. This  widgetized sidebar will also stay active throughout the site, not just on  blog .  Other content management systems There are numerous other content management systems  not covered directly in this  book  that can integrate very well with Magento. All these are publically available  modules, either for sale or free download, to integrate their systems with Magento.  Most of these are third party and their quality has been ensured, prior to their  inclusion in this section of the chapter.  Typo3 Typo3 was founded in 2004 and is defined as a professional Web Content  Management Framework. It is an open source system and has an estimated install  base of 290,000 websites.  TypoGento http:  www.typogento.com allows for Magento integration into Typo3.  It uses both an extension for Typo3 and an extension for Magento to make it work.  However, it permits us to install Magento as a component of Typo3 and to display  our store seamlessly within Typo3. It uses the Typo3 user system and allows for  seamless template customization.  There is an excellent guide available on how to install TypoGento  available at http:  www.typogento.com need-a-docu how-to- install-typogento.html.  Drupal Drupal is an open source content management system that allows an individual or  community to easily publish, manage, and organize a wide variety of content on a  website. Tens of thousands of people and organizations are using Drupal to power  scores of different websites.  [ 184 ]   Chapter 8  Magento integration with Drupal has been put forward for the Google Summer   of Code as an idea: http:  drupal.org node 236456. It is yet to be seen how  significant the idea will be, but it seems like it is gaining some traction in the   Drupal community.  ExpressionEngine ExpressionEngine is a flexible and a feature-rich content management system that  empowers thousands of individuals, organizations, and companies around the world  to easily manage their websites.  eeCommerce  http:  eecommerce.com  implements its own mammoth web  services framework to vastly expand the Magento web services API for enabling it to  integrate Magento into ExpressionEngine entirely. It currently lists its feature set as a  complete solution to integration with ExpressionEngine and Magento.  Joomla! Joomla! is an award-winning and one of the most popular online CMS today. Joomla!  is also open source and offers a mass variety of extensions, with the current catalog  standing at 4400 extensions.  [ 185 ]   Integration of Third-Party CMS  Magento bridge  http:  opensource.jira.nl projects magento-bridge  adds  a bridge between Joomla! 1.5 and the Magento e-commerce platform. It not only  allows for displaying Magento content within the Joomla! component area, but also  ships with Joomla! modules and Joomla! plugins. It's available for purchase at €195.  The bridge uses two types of extensions: on the Joomla!-side a backend component  helps  us to configure the bridge, while a frontend component shows the Magento  content inside the Joomla! component area. Joomla! modules are used to show the  Magento shopping cart somewhere within our Joomla! template. Also, plugins are  available to allow for further integration  search the catalog, user synchronization,  and so on .  On the other side, there is a Magento module which is called through web services.  This not only allows for flexible development, but also to have Joomla! and Magento  installed on separate servers.  Summary That's the end of our integration of third party content management systems chapter.  In this chapter, we have gone through the following:   	 How to install the WordPress extension  	 How to configure the WordPress extension  	 Configuring Magento's display of the WordPress extension  	 Changing the look and display of your templates for the WordPress   integration   	 Which other third party CMS integration packages and extensions for   Expression Engine, Drupal, Typo3 and Joomla! are available  Now, you can practice the integration of Magento for your chosen content  management systems. Try it out with WordPress as a starter, and maybe give one   of the other packages  highlighted towards the end of this chapter  a go and see   how they work out for you!  [ 186 ]   Magento's Core API  In this chapter, we'll be covering one of the most documented features of Magento by  Varien. Bundled with any default installation of Magento comes a web services API  that allows interaction of third party applications and scripts, with several sets of  core data. We can use either SOAP or XML RPC protocols to execute Core API calls  for interaction with those available in the system.  In this chapter, we will go through the following:   	 What the Core API actually does  	 What it can be used for  	 What APIs we have available to us  	 Setting up API access for our scripts  	 What methods of using the API we have available to us  	 The methods and functions the Core API has available  	 Common errors in the API  	 A sample implementation of the customer API for creating, updating,   deleting, and retrieving customer data from within Magento  What is the Core API? The Core API is Magento's bundled API  Application Programming Interface  that  comes with a default installation. It enables us to build applications that interface  with the Customer, Product, and Order data in any Magento installation.   Magento's Core API  Which Core APIs are included? Eighteen APIs currently exist in the system:   	 Customer API  	 Customer's Groups API  	 Customer Address API  	 Country API  	 Region API  	 Category API  	 Category Attributes API  	 Product API  	 Product Attributes API  	 Product Attribute sets API  	 Product Types API  	 Product Images API  	 Product Tier Price API  	 Product links API   	 Order API  	 Shipment API  	  	  Invoice API Inventory API  What do the Core APIs do? Each API allows us to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data belonging to the  appropriate data group with direct code access. This allows us to interface with   data by integrating with our thirdparty script or content management system.  Covering everything from customer data to invoicing and shipping to product data,  each API has its own purpose. The APIs are gathered into groups that each have  their purpose:   	 Customer—For import export of customer details and addresses    to from Magento  	  Customer API 	  Customer's Groups API 	  Customer Address API  [ 188 ]    	 Directory—Retrieving country regions from within Magento  Chapter 9   	 Catalog—For import export of categories and products to from Magento  	  Country API 	  Region API  	  Category API 	  Category Attributes API 	  	  	  	  	  	  	   Product API Product Attributes API Product Attribute sets API Product Types API Product Images API Product Tier Price API Product Links API  	  Order API 	  	  	   Shipment API Invoice API Inventory API   	 Sales—Import export of orders to from Magento  Prerequisites to using the Core API The API can be used out of the box as soon as Magento is installed. The only thing  required for using the API is user permission, set up in the system for authentication.  An account is set up before any script accesses the given APIs. Later on, our script  is able to execute all API calls, using the authorization set up  this will be covered in  detail later .  [ 189 ]   Magento's Core API  Examples of what can be done with   the Core API There are several interesting implementations of the Core API that could be  developed into thirdparty CMSs, such as:   	 Automatic stock updates from the system to a thirdparty application  	 Creating a customer record, invoice, shipment, and updating stock inventory   online when an order is placed off-line   	 Building an import script for all products, customers, and order data  but not   for orders themselves  from an old database or an e-commerce installation  	 Automatically syncing stock inventory into the system, when Excel or CSV   files are not available  Giving scripts access to the Core API In order for our scripts to use the Core API, we need to have an authorization from  Magento. This involves setting up an API user and API key to be passed to Magento,  in order to be allowed to access the API s  that we would want to use with the script.  Let's start by setting up a role for our API user. A role is Magento's term for a set of  access permissions. For example, Administrator and Customer are two different  roles in the standard Magento user system. Here we define our roles in terms of  which resources and methods a user could execute in the system, once authenticated  in the Core API.  We start by logging into the Magento administration system and going to   System->Web Services->Roles, as seen in the following screenshot:  [ 190 ]   Chapter 9  A blank table of roles will be shown initially, as there will be none setup in a default  Magento installation. If the roles have been setup beforehand, then we will see roles  on the page.  We click on Add New Role in the upper-right of the previous screen.  [ 191 ]   Magento's Core API  We will immediately see a page that asks for our new Role Name. Let's call this one  Complete Access. Now that we have a name, it's time to assign resources which the  role will be allowed to execute when it's connected to our API. We click Role Resources in the left sub-navigation menu to bring up the complete  list of resources available which could be assigned to our new role. In this case, we'll  select All from the Resource Access drop-down list  at the top of the page  to give  our API role complete access to all resources.  For limiting the role that we're creating  in any way , we can keep the Resource  Access drop down on Custom and tick the boxes applicable to the resources that we  would like our role to gain access to, when assigned to a user.  [ 192 ]   In this example, however, we'll select All from the Resource Access drop down. We  click Save Role in the upper-right of the page and head back to our roles index  as  we did before . We will see our newly created role on the page.  Chapter 9  Next, let's head on over to create the API user to whom this role will apply. We'll go  to System->Web Services->Users. The No records found screen will be displayed  unless users have been created previously in the system.  We click Add New User in the upper-right side of the screen and progress to the add  New User screen.  In this screen, we'll be able to set our User Name and Api Key, required to interface  with the API. We can also set our personal information such as First Name, Last  Name, and Email. We also have a setting to deactivate the account,  if we ever want  to  without deleting it, but for now let's keep it active.  [ 193 ]   Magento's Core API  We set values to the following, as this will be used as an example later in the chapter:  Field name User Name First Name Last Name Email Api Key Api Key Confirmation This account is  Field value Magentobook Magento Developer's guide me@jhuskisson.com Developersguide Developersguide Active  Once the details are filled in, we click on User Role from the sub-menu on the left of  the screen and choose the role we created earlier, for our new user.  Next, we click Save User  for the successful creation of our API User Name and  API Key for later use in this chapter. Just for full confirmation, we head back to  the System->Web Services->Users page to see our new user account appear with  all its details.  Now that we're done, we can start experimenting with the API and begin using the  methods available to us.  [ 194 ]   Choice of protocols Magento provides a couple of choices for the protocol to use with its Core API;  these are:  Chapter 9   	 SOAP  	 XML RPC  It's a matter of choice between the two. A few of us would simply decide on preference  from previous usage, while some may not be able to use one of the protocols and end  up using the alternative. The following information introduces us to both of them, so  that we can choose between the two protocols.  SOAP SOAP is the newer standard of the two and the most popular. It is also faster in  comparison and should be our default choice of protocol, if it is available to us.  More information about the SOAP protocol and its history can be found  at: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki SOAP or at its official site  http:  www.w3.org TR soap .  Checking for SOAP installation on the server Before we're able to use SOAP on our server and therefore use SOAP as the method  of interacting with the API, we need to make sure that we have the SOAP PHP  extension installed on the server.  To do this, we create a file called phpinfo.php and place the following inside it:  <?php  phpinfo  ;  ?>  [ 195 ]   Magento's Core API  We can save, upload, and access the file directly by inserting the public URL to   this file in our browser. Once accessed, we'll see our server's core setup information  laid out in front of us, to be devoured! We'll have a look at the following screen   titled soap.  Firstly, we'll look for the fact that this SOAP block actually appears. This means that  SOAP is installed on the server. If it isn't installed, we'll have to contact our web host  or server administrator to get the SOAP PHP extension installed before continuing.  If this isn't available to us as an option, we'll have to install XML RPC as the chosen  protocol for interacting with the Magento Core API. Secondly we'll look inside the block at the first setting Soap Client. This shows  whether or not we're able to execute SOAP clients from our web server. If set to  enabled, it means that it is installed and we can go ahead with using SOAP as the  method of choice. If set to disabled, we'll need to contact our web host or web  administrator and make sure that they set it to enabled.  Putting SOAP to use If the SOAP PHP extension is installed and enabled on our server, then we'll be  able to use the SOAP API provided by the Magento Core API without any external  libraries of any kind. Magento's Core API documentation outlines a basic example of  usage, shown below:  $client = new SoapClient 'http:   example.com api soap ?wsdl' ;     If somestuff requires api authentification,    we should get session token $session = $client->login 'apiUser', 'apiKey' ;  $result = $client->call $session, 'somestuff.method' ; $result = $client->call $session, 'somestuff.method', 'arg1' ;  [ 196 ]   Chapter 9  $result = $client->call $session, 'somestuff.method', array 'arg1',  'arg2', 'arg3'  ; $result = $client->multiCall $session, array       array 'somestuff.method' ,      array 'somestuff.method', 'arg1' ,      array 'somestuff.method', array 'arg1', 'arg2'     ;     If you don't need the session anymore $client->endSession $session ;  The key line is the first one, which defines our SoapClient for usage of the API:  $client = new SoapClient 'http:  example.com api soap ?wsdl' ;  Between the SOAP and XML RPC implementation  in terms of code , this last line  is the only line that is different. It is used to initiate the connection to the Magento  Core API and attach an instance of the Core API class to the $client variable. For  example, the function call   will now be accessed via $client->call  , now  that this variable is assigned properly. We must ensure to use the IP address of our  computer  rather than localhost , if we encounter issues, as some versions of PHP  are affected by a problem which stops this call from working properly.  Zend Framework SOAP Client If we prefer using Zend Framework for everything to retain consistency throughout  all of our code in development with Magento, then Zend Framework has a SOAP  Client class. We could use it with Magento Core API, available at the following URL:  http:  framework.zend.com manual en zend.soap.client.html.  XML RPC XML RPC is a fantastic fallback, if SOAP is not available on our web host. Although  it's slightly slower, it's by all accounts a very solid protocol for accessing the Core  API.. By no means is it a different set of code or executions from SOAP.  More information about XML RPC and its history can be obtained at  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki XML-RPC or at its official site  http:  www.xmlrpc.com .  [ 197 ]   Magento's Core API Getting XML RPC on our server With XML RPC, there's no need to install anything on our server to get it to work.  With our implementation, we'll work with Zend Framework's XML RPC client class  to simplify things across the board. What this class does for us is that it provides  an exact match of the SOAP interaction of calling methods and brings consistency  between the methods of using the API.  More about Zend Framework XML RPC class can learned at:   http:  framework.zend.com manual en zend.xmlrpc.html.  Setting up the Zend Framework XML RPC class Before we can use anything related to XML RPC, we need the Zend Framework  XML RPC class. We'll be using this particular class for two reasons:  1.  For consistency between code from Magento and custom modules 2.  Simply to make sure that we're using the same framework for everything   throughout book  We can still use whichever class we choose to with the XML RPC API, as it isn't  limited to the class we're using to interact with it.  We start by heading over to http:  framework.zend.com download current   and downloading the minimal package with just the Zend Framework files. We  would not want any tests, demos, or Dojo Toolkit clogging up our time when  uploading afterwards.  [ 198 ]   Chapter 9  Once we have the minimal package, we place the extracted Zend directory in the  same directory as the planned script that will use the Magento Core API. We use   the following lines of code for including the class:  require_once 'Zend XmlRpc Client.php';  This will give us everything that we need to start putting the Magento Core API  XML RPC protocol to use.  Putting XML RPC to use Magento's provided XML RPC documentation is as follows:  $client = new Zend_XmlRpc_Client 'http:  example.com api xmlrpc ' ;     If somestuff requires api authentification,    we should get session token $session = $client->call 'login', array 'apiUser', 'apiKey'  ;  $client->call 'call', array $session, 'somestuff.method',  array 'arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3'   ; $client->call 'call', array $session, 'somestuff.method', 'arg1'  ; $client->call 'call', array $session, 'somestuff.method'  ; $client->call 'multiCall', array $session,       array          array 'somestuff.method', 'arg1' ,         array 'somestuff.method', array 'arg1', 'arg2'  ,         array 'somestuff.method'           ;     If you don't need the session anymore $client->call 'endSession', array $session  ;  The important line of this example is the initial one:  $client = new Zend_XmlRpc_Client 'http:  example.com api xmlrpc ' ;  This is the only line that is different from the SOAP protocol example in the code.  This is what initializes the XML RPC connection to the Magento Core API and allows  us to start executing calls to interact with Magento.  [ 199 ]   Magento's Core API  Basic API methods Magento provides a set of methods, or functions, that we can use once we have our  API $client set and ready to use. These methods are the standard for performing  calls to the Core API and are the standard for using the Core API with your scripts.  Describing the methods Here are the Basic API methods as outlined by Magento's Core API guide  introduction page:  Method  Description  startSession    endSession sessionId   login apiUser, apiKey   call sessionId,  resourcePath, array  arguments   multiCall sessionId,  array calls, array  options   resources sessionId   globalFaults sessionId   resourceFaults sessionId,  resourceName   starts API session and returns  sessionId ends API session starts API session, returns sessionId  and authorizes apiUser calls API resource that is allowed in  current session  if no session is specified,  you can call only resources that are not  protected by ACL  calls API resource's methods that are  allowed for current session  if no session  is specified, you can call only resources  that are not protected by ACL . If break  option is specified, multiCall breaks  on first error returns list of available API resources  and methods allowed for current  session. returns list of fault messages and  their codes that do not depend on any  resource. returns list of the specified resource fault  messages, if this resource is allowed in  current session.  Return  value string  boolean string  Mixed  array  array  array  array  [ 200 ]   Chapter 9  Understanding the methods individually We'll go through these methods individually, so that we can properly understand  them before moving forward.  The following methods are designed to be used separately in each of the code  examples given. We must remember to separate them and not combine them one  after the other, when trying them out for the first time.  startSession   This method is used to start a session where API authorization isn't required to access  a resource. It's a great option for those building their own APIs for modules, that allow  sharing the Magento installation's data with anyone who wants to work on the API.  A sample usage is as follows:     API opening $session = $client->call 'startSession' ;    API calls and other actions    Ending of the session  The $session variable is populated with our session ID for use later with other  methods and throughout the rest of the script, though in this scenario we won't have  many resources to work with. We can try calling the resources method, to see just  how many we can access.  endSession sessionId  Used to end the API session at the end of our script, to make sure that the API  session has been ended properly.  A sample usage is described below:     API opening     API session start    API calls and other actions  $client->call 'endSession', array $session  ;  This would be placed at the end of our API usage script. The variable $session  would be set either via the startSession   method or returned via the login  method at the start of our script. This array is then passed to our endSession    method at the end of the script. It's important to end sessions for cleaning up the   data that is being stored while the session is in progress.  [ 201 ]   Magento's Core API login apiUser, apiKey  This method is used to authenticate your script with Magento using your API user  and key.  The following is a sample of its usage:     API opening $session = $client->call 'login', array 'Magentobook',  'Developersguide'  ;    API calls and other actions    Ending of the session  The $session variable is populated with our session ID for use later with other  methods and throughout the rest of the script.  call sessionId, resourcePath, array arguments  This is used to call API methods one at a time; it is likely to be the most popular  method that we will use, while working with the Magento Core API. The following  examples demonstrate its usage.  Example one, no arguments needed for a call:  $customers = $client->call $session, 'customer.list' ;  Example two, single argument for a call:  $client->call $session, 'customer.delete', $CustomerId ;  Example three, multiple arguments for a call:  $calls = array       array  'catalog_product.info', 1  ,      array  'catalog_product.info', 2  ,      array  'catalog_product.info', 3  ,   ;  $results = $client->multiCall  $session, $calls  ;  We notice that the $session variable is required for all calls, and that a called  function is executed in the format of:  $client->call $session, $resource,  $arguments ; no matter which variation of the method is being used.  [ 202 ]   multiCall sessionId, array calls, array options  This is used for batch calls, if ever required. It is similar to the previous call method,  but is used for calling several methods at the same time.  It can be used as follows:  Chapter 9  $client->call 'multiCall', array $session,      array          array 'somestuff.method', 'arg1' ,         array 'somestuff.method', array 'arg1', 'arg2'  ,         array 'somestuff.method'           ;  This method is best used when mass updating records or if we like to tidy up  multiple actions into one statement. For example, when inserting an order with a  shipment and invoice all at the same time while importing from another installation.  resources sessionId  This method returns a list of the available methods relating to the current session.  The following is an example of its usage:  $resources = $client->resources $session ;  This will return an array of available resources to our current session. Jisse Reitsma  of Jira ICT wrote the following code to produce a simple output of all the resources  and methods returned by the method, which helps us visualize the output better:             Name:    Aliases:                       Title            Path            Name                                                   [ 203 ]   Magento's Core API                                                   This call is useful when debugging the existing session and can save a lot of heartache  when trying to figure out why a resource or method is not executing properly!  globalFaults sessionId  This method returns global faults with our API usage. It's useful for seeing which  global API faults are occurring, if anything goes wrong. The complete list of these  faults can be found later in this chapter.  It is used as follows:  $faults = $client->globalFaults $session ;  This sets $faults to an array of the global faults currently occurring. You can then  use a foreach   function to get the faults out of the array for a comfortable display  and easy reading.  resourceFaults sessionId, resourceName  This returns faults for a specific resource.  It is used as follows:  $faults = $client->resourceFaults $session, 'resource.name' ;  This then sets an array of faults for the resource.name resource to the variable  $faults , on which we can then use the foreach   function for reading on the  front end.  [ 204 ]   Global API Faults The following are global Core API fault codes that can be returned, no matter what  Core API is being used or which call we execute. These errors apply to each Core API  call available. The support guide outlines them as follows:  Chapter 9  Fault Code 0 1 2 3 4 5  Fault Message Unknown Error Internal Error.  For details, we can read the log file  Access denied Invalid API path Resource path is not callable Session expired, re-login  These will be directly in PHP error format, if the server allows error reporting when  they occur, as shown below:  In the following table, we can see what these errors are and why they occur:  Fault Code 0  1  2  3  4  5  Reason for fault This error is rare and it normally means something extraordinary has  gone wrong. If we read the log, we will come to know exactly what has gone wrong to  cause this error. When we called login, we passed an incorrect API user and key  combination or the API key and user that we passed to the method does  not have rights to call the API method that we're trying to execute. The API path that we had called at the start of our script is invalid and  does not exist. The resource that we're trying to call in our function is not callable by  our API key and user, or simply does not exist. Our API session has expired and we need to log in again.  [ 205 ]   Magento's Core API  Fault Code 0  Fault Message Unknown Error  In the following table, we have the two fault tables together for a quick overview:  Reason for fault This error is rare and it normally means something  extraordinary has gone wrong. If we read the log, we will come to know exactly what  has gone wrong to cause this error. When we called login, we passed an incorrect API  user and key combination or the API key and user  that we passed to the method does not have rights to  call the API method that we're trying to execute. The API path that we had called at the start of our  script is invalid and does not exist. The resource that we're trying to call in our function  is not callable by our API key and user, or simply  does not exist. Our API session has expired and we need to log in  again.  Internal Error. Please  see log for details Access denied  Invalid API path  Resource path is   not callable  Session expired,   re-login  1  2  3  4  5  Basic API scripting: Customer API We start with some basic API scripting to ease us into the operations of the Magento  Core API, starting with the Customers API.  Getting started Most of us would be using SOAP, but this is easily interchangeable with XML RPC   as mentioned earlier in the chapter . We start by setting up our connection to the  API, creating a file called api.php, and placing in it the following:  <?php  ?>  $client = new SoapClient 'http:  m.jhuskisson.com api soap ?wsdl' ;  $session = $client->login 'Magentobook', 'Developersguide' ;  $client->endSession $session ;  Once we've loaded it into our browser, we'll see a blank screen which means that  everything is working nicely.  [ 206 ]   Creating a customer We start by creating a customer in our database; we have data in our default  Magento installation at the moment. Hence, we'll need to insert customers before  we have any data to retrieve or update. Between our login   and endSession    functions we'll enter:  Chapter 9  $customerInfo = array      'firstname'  => 'First',     'lastname'   => 'Last',     'email'      => 'test@example.com',     'password_hash'   => md5 'password' ,     'store_id'   => 0,     'website_id' => 0  ;  $newCustomerId = $client->call $session, 'customer.create', array $customerInfo  ;  We reload our file in the browser and it should take slightly longer to load, but will  still return a blank screen. However, if we take a look at the Manage Customers  screen under Customers->Manage Customers in the Magento administration, we'll  see that the new customer has been created successfully.  We'll also be able to log in as this newly created customer with the e-mail and  password inserted straightaway.  [ 207 ]   Magento's Core API  Retrieving an individual customer's details Now that the customer is in the database, we can retrieve the fictional customer's  details using the customer.info call and the ID of that customer. For example:  $customerId = 1; $customerInfo = $client->call $session, 'customer.info', $customerId ; print var_dump $customerInfo ;  Once we save our file and reload the page, we'll see an array output with all the  variables applicable to this customer's core data.  array 12  {   ["customer_id"]=> string 1  "1"   ["created_at"]=> string 19  "2009-05-25 16:37:40"   ["updated_at"]=> string 19  "2009-05-25 16:37:40"   ["increment_id"]=> string 9  "000000001"   ["store_id"]=> string 1  "0"   ["website_id"]=> string 1  "0"   ["created_in"]=> string 5  "Admin"   ["email"]=> string 16  "test@example.com"   ["firstname"]=> string 5  "First"   ["group_id"]=> string 1  "1"   ["lastname"]=> string 4  "Last"   ["password_hash"]=> string 32  "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99" }  Updating the customer's details We can use this how we like. In our current situation, we can change the name of  this customer via the API, assuming that we have updated it elsewhere away from  Magento. To do this, we should use the following code:  $newCustomerInfo = array      'firstname'  => 'Updated',     'lastname'   => 'Customer'  ;  $client->call $session,          'customer.update',          array $customerId, $newCustomerInfo           ;  var_dump $proxy->call $session, 'customer.info', $customerId  ;  [ 208 ]   Chapter 9  This will update our customer and print out his new details for us to confirm that it  works. If our script has worked, we'll see the customer record updated in Magento, as  well as a new array printed out of the customer's data that shows the new information.  Listing all customers from the database In some cases, we may need to get several customers out of the database rather than  just the one. Maybe we're inserting the information from the customer database of  Magento into another database or need to use it in some way. Magento's Customer  API provides a simple way of doing this, as follows:  $customerList = $client->call $session, 'customer.list' ;  This will return an array of all customers in the database, for us to process through.  It will output exactly how customer.info outputs, but in separate arrays for each  customer returned via the method.  Deleting a customer from the database Lastly, if we want to delete a customer record from the Magento database there's a  method available,  provided we know the customer ID :  $client->call $session, 'customer.delete', $customerID ;  It's as simple as that; the customer with the ID contained in the $customerID  variable will be deleted from the database.  Complete list of available resources and  methods The following is a complete list of all the available resources, APIs, and methods in  the Magento Core API for quick reference.  For full reference with example code for each of the APIs, we can visit:  http:  www.magentocommerce.com wiki doc webservices- api api online.

Core API and  the mass database of data that Magento holds. It's certainly a great addition to the  excellent e-commerce system that is Magento Commerce.  We have gone through the following:  Chapter 9   	 What the Core API actually does  	 What it can be used for  	 What APIs are available to us  	 Setting up API access for our scripts  	 What methods of using the API we have available to us  	 The methods and functions the Core API has available  	 Common errors in the API  	 A sample implementation of the customer API for creating, updating,   deleting, and retrieving customer data from within Magento  With this knowledge, we should be able to write scripts using the Magento Core API.  We must take up the challenge of integrating with a third-party system, for testing  our newly acquired knowledge of Magento Core API.  [ 215 ]    Importing and Exporting Data  In this chapter, we will learn about the built-in method of getting your data in and  out of Magento. Magento is delivered with a set of features aimed at making it  easy to get certain types of data in and out of the system. With the import export  functionality, we can  set up profiles which act as saved records, so that we can  regularly import and export the same data. In practice, this means that if we wish  to do that process regularly, then we can  set up a profile which will ensure that we  don't need to run the filters each time. We can then come back to this, which acts as   a save point for all the settings set up previously for the data import export action.  Here we'll be looking at the profiles that are set up with the system by default, and  how we can add our own for easy import export of data.  What kind of data can I export or import? Magento has the following default Import Export data profiles that come with the  default installation and what data they relate to:   	 Customer data  users who have signed up for the system   	 Product stock data  product stock data only   	 Product data  all attributes relating to products   It's worth increasing the value of the PHP max_execution_time  directive, as product databases over 200-300 products will experience  issues with script timeouts on certain web hosting.   Importing and Exporting Data  There are two types of files that can be used for import export in Magento:   	 Excel Spreadsheet  	 CSV  Comma Separated Values   The typical process is as follows:  1.  Creating a new profile 2.  Naming the profile and choosing direction  import export  3.  Choosing a data type 4.  Configuring the data type  for example with CSV, we choose tabular or   comma separated values   5.  Choosing which type of system data we want to interact with  customers or   products   6.  Filtering this data to meet our needs 7.  Saving our work 8.  Running the profile to produce the desired result  Developers can also export their profiles as XML, in order to advance them under the  Advanced Profiles functionality that comes with Magento. If we'd like to advance a  profile further than the profile builder tool allows, then we can export the profile as  XML to tweak into an Advanced Profile with more advanced actions.  An introduction to the interface Profiles can be found under the Import Export menu, in System->Import  Export->  Profiles. Initially, we'll see a screen displaying all the profiles that we have set up, as  follows:  [ 218 ]   Chapter 10  The default profiles that come with Magento  shown in the previous screenshot   cover the Import Export of Customers, Product, and Product Stocks. These will help  us get started with the feature and can also act as a template for profiles that will be  set up later. We start with opening Export Product Stocks, profile ID 2. At the bottom left-hand  side of the screen, we see four sections: Profile Wizard, Run Profile, Profile Actions  XML, and Profile History. These can be seen when exporting data; an additional tab  named Upload File appears when importing data. The four sections can be summarized as follows:   	 Profile Wizard is where we set up the profile through an interface aimed at   not having us do any of the XML involved with Advanced Profiles.   	 Upload File allows us to upload files to be executed through the profile.  	 Run Profile allows us to run the current profile, as it was last saved.  	 Profile Actions XML allows us to take the raw XML that makes up this   profile and take it into the Advanced Profiles section for advancement with  options that aren't available via the Profile Wizard interface.   	 Profile History shows us actions previously performed with this profile.  Profile Wizard We will focus on the Profile Wizard, as it is where the core of the Import Export  profile feature is based. Let's run through our fields on this tab, which is the default.  Profile Information Profile Information comprises the following components, shown in the screenshot:  [ 219 ]   Importing and Exporting Data Name The name that we assign to our profile in order to locate it later on from within  the system. Entity type This decides which fieldset we interact with for the profile. It takes the options,  Products and Customers. For example, if we select Products, then the fieldset for  Products from the selected store s  will be loaded for interaction with the actions  and methods as selected in the rest of the form. Direction This decides the direction of which we're using the data for the profile. For example,  whether we'll be taking a file and importing the data using the profile, or we'll be  taking the data output from the profile and exporting to a file. It takes the options  Import and Export. Upon selecting Import for Direction, two additional fields will appear. Number of  Records allows us to define how many records will be processed at a time, whereas,  Decimal Separator defines what separates the fields in the file that is being used to  import products.  For example:  Sample data row: store,manufacturer,and price Decimal Separator is the comma  ,  being used to separate data. Store This option allows us to filter the profile to a specific store in our Magento setup.  Store-specific fields will be loaded and only this data will be interacted with. It will  automatically use this store ID for any data being imported, so that there is no need  to declare it in our file when importing. It has the following option: Default  Admin   Store -  . Selecting Default  Admin  Store defines this as a global profile that applies to  all stores, so the store field in our data will need to be set when importing to  specific stores.  [ 220 ]   File information File Information consists of the following components, shown below:  Chapter 10  Data transfer Options: Interactive and Local Remote Server. Interactive  available only for imports , allows us to upload files to be run through  the Run Profile tab. Local Remote Server enables us to fill out the fields to get the file from a source. Type Options: Local Server and Remote Server. Local Server: The file is located on the same server as our Magento installation or  within Magento installation's directories. Remote Server: We need to connect to an FTP connection to either fetch our file for  importing or to store our file after exporting. This will then save the exported file on  another server, ready to be used by another system. Else, it will be fetched from an  external server and then imported.  When we select Remote Server , we will be asked to insert our FTP  information for the connection. This must be filled in for the Remote  Server connection to work.  [ 221 ]   Importing and Exporting Data Path Path is the relative path to the file that we use for the profile, minus the trailing  slash. It should always be  var import_folder, rather than  var import_folder .  There is no need to put our entire root address into the import directory here, just  the part after the Magento root directory. If we have it installed in  root address  magento , then our path will always be automatically prefixed with this by Magento. File File name is the name of the file once in this directory, with file extension, for  example: sample.csv. When using Remote Server as our File Information type, we must be sure to put our  path as relative to the start directory of the FTP connection, once connected. We must  always include our directory name in the public HTML folder.  Data Format Data Format consists of the following components, shown below:  Type Options: MS Excel XML and CSV Tab Separated. This allows us to choose the file  type that is going in or out of the profile. Original Magento attribute names in first row Options: Yes and No.  [ 222 ]   Chapter 10  This allows us to define whether or not Magento should check the field names  against those that are in the Magento attribute database, when importing. It defines  whether we use only field mapping or use it in combination with standard attribute  names from the Magneto database. If set to Yes, it will match against Magneto  attribute names, before looking to the field mapping for answers  about which field  to map the value against . Export Options: All fields and Only mapped fields. This is an export only field. This decides whether our Export profile will export all fields from the Magento  attribute database or it will export only the mapping fields that we outline under   the Field Mapping section.  Field Mapping  Field mapping allows us to control the fields that are imported exported. It is  required before anything is exported, when the Export setting under Data Format  is set to Only mapped fields. It is required for fields that don't match their existing  names, on importing.  It also allows us to change the labels that fields are exported or imported as. For  example, we can export qty as quantity because it's more readable in Excel, or we  could change it to output as product_quantity because this file is to be used to  import data directly into the database.  [ 223 ]   Importing and Exporting Data Export Filters This section is extremely valuable when filtering down large datasets for more  efficient export profiles. It allows us to put in filters to be applied to our dataset, so  that we create profiles that are specific to certain needs. Below, we see the Export  Filters screen, when exporting products:  The Export Filters screen only appears when we select Export in  the Direction field.  For example:   	 With products, exporting a stock quantity between 0 and 20 would allow    us to export those products that are low in stock.   	 With products, selecting a certain product type from the Type field would  allow us to distribute product type management to a relevant department.   	 With customers, selecting our wholesale group would allow us to only   export our wholesale customers.   	 With customers, we can filter by country to get customers from    certain countries.  Upload Files The Upload Files tab only appears on import, but allows us to upload files onto  the server to be processed. Once we've selected our file, we click Save and Continue  Editing; this will upload the file onto the server. Once it's uploaded, we select  Run Profile.  [ 224 ]   Chapter 10  Upload Files appears only in Import profiles and does not relate to  Export profiles.  Run Profile This is the section from which we can run our profile. We click on Run Profile  in Popup to initiate the profile, ensuring beforehand that any changes performed  have been saved. Once we have done this, we will be presented with a series of  messages until the profile is complete. This will finish with a log of the actions that  the script has gone through and some debug messages that keep us posted about   the happenings.  If we import, then we will need to upload our files through the Upload File tab and  select the file from a dropdown before clicking Run Profile in Popup.  [ 225 ]   Importing and Exporting Data  The profile will not run unless our changes are saved. Hence, we'll need  to save changes prior to uploading a file through the profile.  Profile Action XML From here, we can get the Profile Action XML to be placed into the Advanced  Profiles section within the Import Export menu. This section is advancing our  profile beyond what the default profile builder will allow us to do.  [ 226 ]   Profile History This tab has a history of when the current profile was created, updated, and executed.  It also provides us with the details of the person who performed these actions.  Chapter 10  Sample implementation: Import Export   of metadata A sample usage of importing exporting data in Magento is to use it to control the  product metadata stored for all of our products. Sometimes SEO  Search Engine  Optimization  companies want to tweak metadata en masse. When using Magento's  import export functionality, this reduces the overhead of appointing someone to  traverse the data, product-by-product, to edit everything.  To do this, we create:  and manage   	 An export profile to get all of our product metadata out for us to edit     	 An import profile to import all of our changes back into the system  Exporting our metadata We begin by creating a new profile. For that, we click on the Add New Profile button  in the top-right of the initial Profiles screen. For setting up our metadata export profile, we have the following settings:  [ 227 ]   Importing and Exporting Data Setting up the Profile Information This will be a products export profile across all stores and should be named Export  META Data.  Field Name  Entity Type Direction Store  Value Export META Data Products Export Default  Admin  Values  Adding the File Information Our file should be stored in  var export and be named as meta_data_export.xml  on our local server, once the profile has been executed.  Field Data transfer Type File Name Path  Value Local Remote server Local server meta_data_export.xml var export  Selecting the Data Format  We try an MS Excel XML formatted file with a spreadsheet named Meta Data. This  format has its advantages over CSV, as its less prone to formatting issues causing  rows to not import. There is more of an internal file structure separating data, which  leads to better results when using it.  We set it only to mapped fields which we outline and ensure that Magento attribute  names will not be used.  Field Type Spreadsheet Name Original Magento Attribute Names   Value MS Excel XML Meta Data No  in the first row Export  Only mapped fields  [ 228 ]   Mapping our fields We stick to only meta information fields and the store sku values, so that we have  product relation covered when we import back into Magento. To make things a little  more interesting, we customize the field names.  Chapter 10  Original field store sku meta_title meta_keyword meta_description  Mapped to store_code product_sku meta_data_title meta_data_keyword meta_data_description  Choosing the Export Filters Here we limit the number of export filters, so that only enabled products are  exported, to cut down on unnecessary changes to products not on the site.  Field Status   Value Enabled  Once saved, we go back to the Run Profile section to export our file. After this is  done, we go into the  var export directory within the Magento setup directory to  find the exported file of product metadata.  When we open this file in MS Excel, it appears nicely  as any normal spreadsheet  would , with our spreadsheet name as outlined previously. We make a few random  edits, and take note of the products that we have edited for future use, when we  wish to ensure that the import has worked.  Importing our metadata Now that we have our export profile and we've edited all of our data, we need to  be able to import our changes back and have Magento process them. To do this, we  need to set up a profile to import and process this data correctly.  Now, we set up another profile with the following settings for our import profile:  [ 229 ]   Importing and Exporting Data Setting up the Profile Information This will be a products import profile across all stores and be named Import  META Data.  Field Name  Entity Type Direction Store Number of records Decimal Separator  Value Import META Data Products Import Default  Admin  Values 1 .  Adding the File Information We make the profile interactive, so that we can upload our own file to be executed  and processed.  Field Data transfer  Value Interactive  Selecting the Data Format We use MS Excel XML with a spreadsheet named Meta Data, limiting it to only  mapped fields  outlined by us . We ensure that Magento attribute names will be  used in the first row.  Field Type Spreadsheet Name Original Magento Attributes  Names  Value MS Excel XML Meta Data No  in the first row  [ 230 ]   Chapter 10  Mapping our fields We map the fields similar to how we did before.  Original field store sku meta_title meta_keyword meta_description  Mapped to store_code product_sku meta_data_title meta_data_keyword meta_data_description  Once we set this up, we click the Save and Continue Editing button and go to  Upload File on the left sub-navigation menu and upload our changed file via the  Upload File tab. Then we click on Save and Continue Editing and return to the Run  Profile tab. Then we select the file that we just uploaded from the drop-down list and  run our import profile through. The following screenshot will be displayed:  The profile has been imported successfully and the test run updated all the profiles  without fail. We check our products via the sku values that we changed under  Manage->Manage Products. We find that the META data information has now  been updated.  [ 231 ]   Importing and Exporting Data  Common issues with importing exporting The following issues are encountered while importing exporting.  Bad CSV file formatting Often the cause of a bad import and missing rows from the import, is that of bad  file formatting. This case is more likely to occur in the CSV file format than MS  Excel. This happens because the CSV file type is much more prone to data breakages  through bad formatting.  Short descriptions Although we can make sure a short description goes on for as long as we like within  Magento, via Profiles we should ensure that it isn't more than 255 characters.  Import export paths We need to verify that they are writeable. It sounds like an obvious mistake, but  many developers don't look at the basics before they look into why everything is  going wrong.  Images location We need to ensure that if we import images with your products, they are placed in   media import. Otherwise, they will throw errors and will not be imported. If the  value of our image column is  sub-directory image_name.jpg, then the URL to  where the image should be placed within Magento installation is: media import  sub-directory image_name.jpg.  Importing multiple images In our CSV MS Excel XML file, adding either multiple image or small images, or  thumb columns to add multiple images into the product, causes a problem.  [ 232 ]   Chapter 10  Summary In this chapter, we have learned:   	 What types of data we can export from Magento from a default installation  	 What types of data we can import into Magento from a default installation  	 The file types that we can use for these actions  	 How to set up our own data profile in order to import export data ourselves  	 How to manage META data en masse using these profiles  	 How to solve some of the common issues in the profile functionality  Further to this, we should try and experiment with Magento's import export data  functionality. We should be able to comfortably manage the data profiles that are  included in the default Magento installation and should be able to create our own  basic profiles.
