About the Reviewer      v  PROVIDE ME,  IF ANY   vi      Acknowledgement  My parents have always supported, encouraged, and inspired me to put mine in  my best efforts in everything I do. They were my earliest teachers, mentors, and  coaches and always led by example. I owe them a huge debt repayment of which  is beyond my imagination. My brother has been a source of strength, courage,  and conviction. My teachers, many of whom gave their heart and soul to their  noble profession ceaselessly believing in the significance of their work in shaping  the lives of young minds, deserve way more than we can ever give. My family,  including Deepthi, Pino, Kittu and Rinku, for permitting me to take time out to  focus on this book deserves a special mention.  The cybersecurity team at Subex, which includes some of the brightest and capable  minds in the industry provided me with inputs and inspiration at critical junctures.  Last but not least, the team at BPB, especially Ishita for investing their faith in me  and for helping me fine-tune this book.        vii  Preface  Years ago, when I started my career in emerging tech, I found a world of intrigue,  mystery, and fascination to explore. It was almost magical in intensity and as I  went from AI to IoT and then to cybersecurity, the challenges of imagination and  execution grew but so did the learnings, the satisfaction, and the need to adapt  and excel. Despite the significant strides made in the past few years, the emerging  tech universe remains unexplored in large parts presenting job seekers and all  stakeholders an incredible opportunity to capitalize on.  Emerging Tech or ET, as we will call it from now on, holds the greatest promise for  transforming mankind. Today, as the ‘New Normal’ brought about by the Covid-19  pandemic sets in, ET becomes our ally in defeating not just the pandemic but also  the economic and social fallouts left in its wake. No matter how you look at it, ET is an impressive playground to be part of. This  is especially true for those of us who love challenges and in pushing the frontiers  of imagination each day. I am in no way implying that we can keep the traditional  technologies  aside  now  and  plunge  headfirst  into  ET.  Traditional  tech  is  still  holding the world together and needs its share of attention. But as someone who  started his career in traditional tech and has moved on to ET, I can assure you that  the two are worlds apart yet conjoined in many ways by the diversity of outcomes  that mankind seeks from technology and its usage.  Humankind’s  future  hinges  on  our  ability  to  explore  and  capitalize  on  the  opportunities  that  emerging  tech  affords.  Be  it  space  tech,  cryptocurrency,  extended reality or even monitoring and interacting with environments that are  not conducive for human beings, it is ET that has helped us gain a beachhead and  carve our ambitions. No matter what the future holds, it is ET that will propel our  imagination and leap of faith across industries and deliver answers to the most  pressing questions that we face as a species.    This book is a collection of my learnings from all these years. It is a synthesis  of my ET journey thus far. The idea for this book came during the innumerable  interactions I have had with students and technology professionals who were keen  on knowing how they can transition to an ET career or strengthen their career  narrative in ET. This book is a collection of proven best practices that have worked  for me or those who I have worked with or had a chance to interact with.    viii      It also establishes a broader context for you, the reader, to explore, interact with  and implement.  There are practical tips, tests, and exercises in addition to warning signs to watch  out  for  and  chapters  that  deal  with  common  problems  we  have  observed  in  candidates who have given interviews for ET positions. As an ET practitioner,  I find it amusing to see prospective candidates treat ET jobs and interviews the  same way their predecessors used to treat traditional jobs as a chore.    This book has sections on job hunting, career satisfaction, improving your ET job  quotient, managing phases of recession, standing out in your company or your  industry, and evolving into a thought leader.    I have also sprinkled plenty of anecdotes from physics, palaeontology, contemporary  history, astrophysics, and more to induce multi-situation thinking. In addition to  bearing a direct correlation with the immediate context, such anecdotes also help  in provoking curiosity and feed your imagination. Growth without intellectual  curiosity is akin to evolving without expansion of imagination. The former feeds  the latter. ET professionals must work across use cases, adoption challenges, and  resource scarcity. So it is good to cultivate the luxury of having multiple contexts to  help you think differently to derive innovative solutions while applying new tech.  The world has changed, so should you When  I  started  writing  this  book  in  early  January  2020,  no  soothsayer  had  imagined, let alone predicted, how the world would change dramatically a few  months  down  the  line.  The  world  was  uncertain  even  in  January,  but  it  looks  more uncertain, clueless, and an anxious place to be now than ever before. No one  has the answers yet. The pandemic is also widening the existing chasms in some  countries where segments of the population are refusing to take social distancing  and other important measures seriously.  The world will move on. But for you, this opportunity or rather this window  will not be open for long. The pandemic has unleashed a whole new set of use  cases around ET, and the trend will continue. If anything, the reliance on ET has  increased in the last three months. While many businesses are on the defensive,  working hard to conserve capital and resources, humanity itself stands on the cusp        ix  of transformation. The world you and I are used to before is not going to be around  anymore.  This is the right time to do your bit to fortify your career, attain a new  level, and take charge.    As in life, there are no shortcuts to success. But with this book, I hope you get to  connect with a different way of looking at your ET career. The onus is entirely on  you to use the suggestions and learnings from this book to improve your career.  When done the right way, you will be able to reduce your learning curve and shift  the energy saved to other areas of your career or personal life that need attention.   Finally, no matter what you do, invest passion, perseverance, and energy. Nothing  great  can  be  achieved  without  these  three.  Invest  in  lifting  yourself  and  those  around you. Your time is now, and the clock is ticking.  Go for it.  Wishing you success and excellence.  Chapter 1  provides a brief introduction to the topic, specifically in terms of how a  career in ET is different from everything else and how one can be prepared for the  future from a professional and personal standpoint. This chapter sets the context  for the book.  Chapter 2, this chapter will help the reader decide on a specific emerging technology  they may want to work on if they have not done so. It also bursts some popular  and not so popular myths. It clarifies concepts related to an ET career so that the  reader can deepen their understanding while avoiding rumours and falling into  the misinformation trap.    Chapter 3, what kind of roadmap can help you in reaching your career goal faster?  This chapter outlines a technique for designing a comprehensive career roadmap  in the emerging tech space.     Chapter 4 is about identifying the requirements that potential candidates need to  have. In case you are already in working in the ET field, this chapter will help you  identify specific measures to address knowledge or other gaps to help you add  momentum to your career. The focus is on connecting with people and resources  you need to succeed.     x      Chapter  5  talks  about  ways  to  handle  headwinds  and  tailwinds  that  could  potentially have a significant impact on your ET career. There is also a section that  outlines a career change action plan for those who are planning to switch over  from other technologies to ET.  Chapter 6 deals with preparing an ET friendly resume and highlights points the  reader has to keep in mind while choosing your next ET employer.  What are the  nuances one needs to keep in mind while zeroing in on your next employer, and  what are the pitfalls to avoid? You can get answers in this chapter. Chapter 7 describes ways in which you can fine-tune your social media presence  to get hired through channels such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium, SlideShare, etc.  The focus is on understanding the fundamentals of social media hiring so that you  can use them to improve your chances as also elevate your professional standing.  Chapter 8 is all about new, unique, proven, and not so well known job search  strategies that you can use in a phased manner to get hired by your target employer.  This includes methods that improve your visibility and your discoverability by  recruiters. There is also a comprehensive section on dos and don’ts. Chapter 9 outlines ET specific strategies and measures to impress your potential  interviewer. By going way beyond conventional approaches, this chapter lays out  innovative use case-based strategies and tactics to walk out of an interview with  an offer on your terms.  Chapter 10 reveals the secret sauce of a successful career in ET using examples from  the real world. There is a para on a method to preserve your IQ and intellectual  capabilities after you cross your twenties.    Chapter 11 speaks about targeting a new peak in your career. When you become a  thought leader, you have arrived in more ways than one. What kind of measures  do you need to deploy to become a thought leader? What are the implications, and  why is it so important to become one? It also outlines measures to fight professional  inertia emerging from a lack of motivation or other factors.        xi  Chapter 12, what is meant by the illusion of progress? How do you make sure you  are growing and living up to your potential? What can you do if you find out you  are not? This chapter answers such questions.  Chapter 13 what is meant by the New Year quandary, and how does that impact  your career? How can you put your ET career in high gear and become someone  the industry and your peers look up to? The answer lies in a thoughtfully crafted  two-year plan that places you closer to your goal.      Chapter 14 leadership is a prism that radiates many colours. Who could have  imagined that a single beam of light could hide within its streams of photons such  a diversity of wavelengths and outcomes? It takes a carefully suspended drop of  water or an engineered piece of glass to expose these colours.  This chapter tells  you how you can develop your diverse leadership qualities through examples to  shrink your learning curve.  Chapter 15, what does it takes to launch a start-up? What does it take to build a  successful start-up?

It  was  the  right way of settling faster into domains where a stable career path presented itself,  backed by a monetary cushion. Even during times of recession in 2008, jobs in such  tech were in demand. Things, however, changed with the emergence of a plethora  of emerging technologies that have redefined the entire technology landscape and  brought along lasting changes the full import of which is yet to be felt. When  the  ground  beneath  one’s  feet  shifts  or  when  tectonic  forces  start  reshaping  the  world  we  live  in,  it  is  often a tad too late to act. Those who  work after the tremors are felt will end up missing opportunities that often come  to the first or early responders who move on intuition or empirically using data  to predict the direction of the winds. An ideal world balances these two extremes,  but then we are not residing in one. But if we have our ears to the ground, we can  decipher patterns that yield data on the way forward. So how does one foresee these changes? To begin with, one needs to act with a certain  degree of diligence, enthusiasm, and a general idea on the direction they want their  professional lives to move to. This is the proverbial first step. As we will uncover in  chapters that follow, there is a lot more that needs to be done to stay competitively   What’s my ‘shelf life’ in the industry?  Key question   2      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  relevant in today’s day and age. Choosing the right technology to work on is one big  part of that effort.  Always remember that an average person spends about 90,000 hours at work during  their lifetime. The question you should be asking is whether those hours are spent  doing something you love or something you are forced to? A career in emerging  technologies will help you open a whole new frontier and connect with a new realm  of possibilities and opportunities. Even the skies are not a limit for the one who is  determined and ready. Structure In this chapter we will discuss the following topics:         Objectives After studying this unit, you should be able to:         Understanding how a career in ET is worth pursuing    How are ET careers different from everything else?    How do you know it’s for you?    Q&A     Make a choice either to pursue a career in ET or otherwise    Understand the considerations that should be considered before arriving at   such a decision  1.1 A career in emerging tech  ET  Understanding the requirements for a career in ET is essential before we moved  forward to the next chapters. The Internet of Things  IoT , Blockchain, Augmented  Reality Virtual Reality, Robotic Process Automation, cybersecurity, and Quantum  Computing have all emerged as game-changers in the last decade. Each of these is  working in tandem across domains to incur digital transformation in part or whole  and to transform the business process operations, outcomes, and other aspects. They  are getting entrenched in various verticals while acquiring a distinct flavor in every  industry or process they obtain association with. ET  careers  are  inherently  different.  To  begin  with,  there  are  still  complexities  associated with the way various domains are using these technologies. Then there  is the stage of adoption, geography, and many other variables. All these have a  significant bearing on someone who wishes to work in this technology. Here are a  few points of difference between careers in emerging tech and traditional tech:   Introduction      3  ET  Changes happen every  week, and these changes  may or may not be  propagated. Yet to reach an inflection  point. Start-ups, separate lines of  business within existing  big businesses and medium  players  Low or non-existent; some  segments may be subject  to an excess of scrutiny  though  for instance  artificial intelligence and  IoT . Emerging   Factor  Dynamics  Adoption   Players  Traditional technology Changes occur over 180  days or more; propagation  of these changes take at  least 200 days more.  Widespread; nearing  saturation. Enterprises and medium  players    Government and policy  support   High   Evolved   Marketing and sales  strategies  The average tenure of  employment in the same  company  Average team size  High  6 years or more    Low  less than 4 years    Table 1.1: Differences between traditional and emerging tech careers  >2  1   These are but a few examples. When one digs deeper, more differences begin to  emerge. It is these differences that will drive innovation in these technologies and  therefore  have  a  bearing  on  people  who  wish  to  work  on,  sell,  or  market  these  technologies. For  purposes  of  understanding,  can  an  analogy  be  drawn  between  a  career  in  emerging  technologies  and  evolution?  Most  people  talk  about  evolution  as  a  metaphor for advancement and progress to the next logical step, stage, or phase of  growth. If we were to go with the explanation given by one of my favorite authors,  biologist Richard Dawkins, the process of natural selection that drives evolution in  the natural world is a blind watchmaker because it does not work with or toward  a purpose, does not plan consequences and has no meaning in view. He also talks  about the concept of organized complexity to explain step-by-step progress towards  complexity to derive what can be called organized complexity to account for the  emergence of sophisticated self-replicating units such as the DNA. A  career  in  emerging  technologies,  on  the  other  hand,  works  with  and  toward  more complexity in an unorganized manner. The forces that influence growth and    4      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  evolution in the ET world include competitive differentiation, constant learning and  unlearning, little or no stickiness to technology, adaptability, market dynamics, and  resilience. Natural progression includes progress or rather a movement to a next  phase driven by a set of circumstances influenced in part, whole or little by the  organism or its competition or environment conditions. In our case, the move is  influenced by the need to have a satisfying, dynamic, and rewarding career that  could entail not so long periods of gestation to deliver results aligned to one’s true  potential. You need to look at cultivating these traits if you are serious about a career in ET:               Solution-oriented thinking    Use-case based approach    Ability to take a problem out of its immediate context to search for solutions    Ability to acquire, analyze, and co-relate tons of data    Foresight to understand the direction in which various customer groups and   industries are headed     Ability to reinvent and reimagine    You will learn more about these in the chapters to follow. 1.2 No longer a matter of choice According to the US Bureau of Labor, in 2014, 9 out of 10 Americans were employed  in just 10 occupations. According to the same agency, a modern-day professional  will be part of at least 11 different jobs in one’s career. Consider how different this  was from how things were in the eighties and the nineties when most people used to  begin their career in and retire in the same job, albeit at a different level. Things are changing faster than our ability to adapt to and change [in some cases  faster than our ability to imagine]. This is both an opportunity and a threat. When  social  media  appeared  on  the  horizon  in  the  2000s,  few  thought  Business-to- Business  B2B  companies would be successful in leveraging it. But in less than  half a decade, B2B companies also started leveraging social channels for not just for  conversing with stakeholders but also to influence and sell. As newer technologies emerge on the horizon, getting employed in companies that  are working on such technologies or start-ups that are working on them becomes  imperative. Due to the onset of the economic depression brought about by Covid-19,  many organizations are now beginning to reflect on how the future will look for  them and their stakeholders. The new normal as they call it arrived while many of  us were busy complying with our pre-practiced routine and adhering to everything  has worked for us in the past. The ground beneath our feet has shifted in less than  90 days.   Introduction      5  No matter how far you can see in the future, nothing is certain anymore. The forces  that are at play are acting just like a blind watchmaker moving us in a direction that  none of us can foresee or imagine. Yes, things have changed the clock will never  go in the reverse. January 2020 will never return. It is therefore time to change. It is  time to look ahead and embrace a career with technologies that are more aligned to  the new normal. Here are some of the benefits you can get by being associated with  emerging tech:       Get a head start: get entrenched in a niche space early, gain experience and  move on or try out new roles and responsibilities or gain enough knowledge,  expertise, contacts, or experience to start something on your own.     Differentiate your career trajectory and get a chance to try out new things.     Stay agile: the fluid nature of modern tech affords agility and a canvas for a   change.     Future-proof  your  career:  once  you  have  had  the  experience  of  working  with one emerging tech, you can use that experience to propel yourself to a  new domain or tech.      Gain valuable transferable skills: get skills  sales, business development,  marketing, and others  that will be useful in case you wish to change tracks  in the future or case recession strikes.      Sharpen your project management skills     Get to work with the most diverse workforce in places as varied as Tallinn,   Buenos Aires, Austin, London, Mexico City, and more.  Working in the ET industry has indeed been a very fruitful and rewarding journey  for me. It has kept me on my feet all these years, and it has helped me grow like  no other role or role before it. Getting a role in ET is not an end. Instead, it is the  beginning  of  a  very  long  journey  filled  with  milestones  and  many  moments  to  cherish and introspect on. ET is built for people with a certain mindset. Some of the  attributes of such people are as follows:       They  are  givers  and  those  who  believe  in  contributing  in  whatever  way   possible to help the team company succeed.     Not worried about their designations or destination of work; they are not  bothered by the size of their cabins or the number of folks reporting to them.  If these things matter to you, you can stop here.     A  hunger  to  win  and  do  something  unique   which  may  or  may  not  be   recognized .     A wiliness to learn continuously at all phases in life.    Have a positive outlook towards life and are always happy to help others.    Love challenges in whatever shape or size they may present themselves.                                6      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code          Have no time to crib or whine  you can do it once a while though .    Are inspired by nature, science, mathematics, their colleagues, or someone   close to them.     Are the problem solvers.    1.3 The road ahead With the demand for ET professionals set to rise, the job descriptions are also getting  leaner and clearer. Finding a career path in ET is still an elusive goal. There are two  reasons for this. The ET segment is a dynamic one, and as the technologies evolve,  newer positions are created for which there are no precedents available. So if you  have to look at a role model of someone  preferably an outsider  who has risen in his  or her career, you may not have too many choices to go with. The second reason has  to do with the kind of companies working with emerging tech. These companies are  mint fresh and haven’t figured out ways to help their employees grow and evolve  their careers in a structured manner. I spoke to a few industry experts to find out what inspired them to pursue a career  in ET. While many decided to work in this field while they were in college, others  tried out careers in IT and or software engineering or in non-tech roles in product  companies before embarking on a path to discover a more specialized career in ET. If one were to chart a journey in ET, one has to understand the various openings that  exist across levels. It is important to do such a mapping and be ready with enough  data to back the milestone you chose on the path you have imagined for your career.  To  give  you  an  example,  here  are  some  of  the  popular  career  options  based  on  experience level in the field of cybersecurity:       Entry-level  roles:  Systems  engineer,  security  specialist,  web  developer,   systems administrator IT technician, and network engineer.     Mid-level roles: Security technician, penetration tester, threat intelligence  analyzer,  security  analyst,  incident  responder,  security  auditor,  and  cybersecurity consultant.     Advanced-level roles: Cybersecurity lead, cybersecurity architect, security  analyst, cyber risk manager, risk analyst, a cybersecurity engineer, and chief  information security officer.        There are more examples in the following chapters. If you look at these openings,  you  can  see  a  pattern  here.  Entry-level  roles  often  require  a  very  high  level  of  technology exposure. For roles with more experience, you may need some exposure  to specific technologies. So, if you have never worked on these technologies, how  can you appeal to a recruiter or a company?    Introduction      7  I have outlined multiple approaches to deal with this challenge in the subsequent  chapters. You will, however, have to figure out a way to get some level of exposure  going to move faster towards your goal. Doesn’t work with any assumptions, always  assume that the competition is tough and that you will need to enhance your game  by a significant number of notches? Always remember:       Working with ET is not about salary alone. It is a good factor to take into   consideration, but it should never be the sole motivation.     To rise to the challenge, you also need to improve your skillsets, communication   skills, problem-solving aptitude, and your ability to imagine. If you are a problem solver, you are already halfway there.        An unstructured environment often offers tremendous growth opportunities,   but it can also be tiring for those who lack enough energy or dynamism.     ET always keeps you on your feet so be ready for some restless days and              evenings.  My own experience with ET has been fascinating. It brought a refreshing change  to my career, made me expand my ability to learn and conceptualize and do things  faster. 1.4 Be inspired About 600 centuries ago, our ancestors first stepped out of Africa on a journey that  took them to the frontiers of all livable continents culminating in the tip of South  America – the edge of continents. This journey in waves led to the population of large  landmasses as also some interesting encounters such as those with the Neanderthals  and Denisovans and hypothetically some more species of humans who are yet to be  discovered. This  journey,  fed  by  grit  and  determination,  led  to  human  beings  reaching  the  pinnacle of evolutionary success. The spirit of discovery and adventure still lies  among us. It is the same spirit that took us to the moon and will take us to Mars  sometime shortly. It is also the same spirit that will propel your journey into ET and  take you places. Our  ancestors  could  have  chosen  to  stay  back  and  roamed  the  plains  of Africa,  but they chose to explore. The motivations may be food, or they wished to avoid  competition or predators. We moved across continents faster than the Neanderthals.  This is why today; the only remnants of those ancient humans  the Neanderthals   are the 2-4 percent of genes we inherited from them thanks to some humans inter- breeding with them eons ago. This is also why we are the last remaining species  of hominids on this planet. This is a remarkable achievement for a young species  [considering the geological time scale].   8      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  The Neanderthals remain a subject of endless fascination among researchers, but we  as humans are today the only species of humans alive. All other species have gone  extinct, leaving us behind as the sole inheritors of a legacy that lives on to this day.  Every other branch of humans is now but a set of genes that resides within us in  parts. If you don’t choose to go on an exploratory path, you may not lose much. You may  still end up having a stellar career in the field you have been part of for ages. But  unless  you  undertake  this  journey  of  discovery,  you  will  never  know  what  you  would have missed if you wouldn’t have made this leap of faith. Let me close this chapter with an interesting anecdote. In September 2019, Goldman  Sachs advertised for the position of leader of the quantum computing team within  R&D  engineering.  Surprisingly,  even  after  a  month  had  passed,  the  firm  didn’t  receive a single application. According to the efinancial careers portal, the problem seems to be this. Goldman’s  requirements are fairly precise: it wants someone who can identify applications for quantum  computing across Goldman, who can talk to clients about quantum computing, who can liaise  with Goldman staff and academics, and who can lead the new quantum computing research  team. The ideal candidate would seem to be a quantum computing Ph.D. with client-facing  skills, which might be hard to come by. So  do  you  relate  to  the  above  anecdote?  Do  you  see  it  as  an  opportunity  or  an  indication of a general aversion towards quantum computing roles in particular and  ET roles in general? If your answer is the former, this book is for you. Read on. Conclusion A career in ET is not just about finding your mojo. Instead, it is about finding new  ways to express your potential. Life is too short and precious to work in fields that  you don’t relate to. Look at yourself as a retired 60-year-old how will it be when  you look back at your career? Will you have memories that bring a smile and make  you proud? Or will you simply be happy that you survived all the ups and downs  without doing something worthwhile as your designations changed for the better?  You always have a choice.  If you are passionate, ambitious, diligent, and care about bringing a true change in  the way people interact with and consume technology, then your new playground  awaits. In this chapter, we studied about how why a career with ET is the way forward. In  the next chapter, we will learn about selecting the best ET tech stream to work with.   Introduction      9                  Question and answers 1.  With the arrival of new ET jobs, will the traditional sectors survive? Will     they still be good places to build one’s career?    Ans. There is no threat to the traditional segments as they will also evolve and  embrace ET in some form or manner. This is already happening. They will  still attract job seekers. But delving on the strengths of jobs in the traditional  sectors is beyond the scope of this book.  2.  What are the kinds of trends we are seeing in the ET job market?     Ans.  Jobs  around  artificial  intelligence,  machine  learning,  cybersecurity,  Robotic Process Automation or RPA, Virtual and Augmented Reality, IoT,  and Edge Computing have risen in the last few months according to various  job sites. I feel that jobs in IoT will see the maximum demand in the coming  months. There has been a significant rise in the IoT use cases in areas such as  healthcare and supply chain management and these two sectors alone will  see a huge uptake.    On the downside because of the pandemic, many start-ups have shut down  and many established players have stopped hiring so there is going to be a  lull period in the next few months post which hiring will pick up.  3.  How has the pandemic changed the ET landscape?   Ans. In  the  last  few  months  alone,  we  have  seen  companies  coming  out  with  solutions  around  social  distancing  and  remote  body  temperature  information gathering. This is just a start and we are going to see plenty of  innovative applications and use cases involving ET coming to the fore. Some  of the challenges that have emerged in the last few months due to Covid-19  can only be sorted through the application of ET.   10      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code   The Best ET for Me and Some Myth Bursting      11  Chapter 2 The Best ET for  Me and Some  Myth Bursting  Technology is the campfire around which we tell our stories.  – Laurie Anderson  Introduction Each flavor of ET entails a different set of behaviors, approaches, understanding,  skillsets, and vision. To move into and succeed, you need to mix these factors up  with short and long terms goals. There are many aspects to be considered if one were to look at a career in emerging  tech.  The  easier  ones  are  future  outlook,  untapped  potential,  jobs  available,  and  jobs expected to be created, adoption rates, and so on. In the case of blockchain, for  instance, according to the job portal Indeed.com, in less than half a decade  Sept 2015  to Sept 2019 , jobs available in the cryptocurrency and blockchain-related segments  per  million  witnessed  an  enormous  1400  percent  increase.  Cryptocurrency  job  postings per million alone have grown by 26 percent. Despite this surge, the number of professionals working on the blockchain continues  to  be  well  below  the  potential  of  this  technology  segment. Also,  the  number  of  candidates searching for jobs in this field increased significantly, according to the job  portal. This indicates a possible increase in competition for the available roles. This  trend is more or less repeated in other sectors as well.

For instance, you can have I am highly analytical come as  number one  and then see which tech matches up. Every time a tech enters column  two, it gets 5 points. 4 for column 3, 3 for column four, 2 for column 5, and 1 for  column six. For instance, in the above table, IoT gets 33 points out of 40, making it a top choice  for the person. This  is  a  crude  method  but  brings  you  closer  to  a  decision.  You  can  add  more  parameters to make it more accurate. As a next step, network and consult with folks  in the industry and ask them these questions:       How  does  it  feel  like  working  with  _________  tech?

While doing this exercise, please be mindful of the time of the respondent. In case  you are unable to get answers from them, you can also visit their LinkedIn profile  and gather answers from their profile itself. Primarily you have to focus on the  following:       Their career trajectory. How they started, where they are now, and what are   they doing?     What clues do you get about the direction they are taking?    How are they positioning themselves?    What competitive differentiator s  are they using to stand out?    Their social media activities.    The events they attend etc.     Who do they follow on social media?              It is advisable to keep your curiosity focused on these aspects so that you don't get  distracted and overwhelmed with data and are also not accused of stalking in any  manner. 2.2 Self-assessment In  addition  to  the  above,  conduct  a  personal  self-assessment  by  asking  these  questions:           Why do you want to choose a career in ET? What is your motivation?    What are your career priorities?    What values do you live by? Do they align with what you feel you will be         What influences have you retained in your life so far, and do they agree with   doing in the ET world?  a role in ET?  2.3 Test drive It is advisable to try and get a flavor of the role you are aspiring for so that you  become sure of your journey and also get some experience worth talking about.  Other options to test drive your options:      Taking up a related part-time job    Opting for an exploratory course     The Best ET for Me and Some Myth Bursting      17       Job shadowing      Study further      Volunteering      Get a certification done 2.4 For students Students can opt for these options in addition to the above:        Internships        Study abroad    Undergraduate research Things to remember: Your career is not your job, and your job is not your  career, so never mix the two. 2.5 Bursting some common myths There are two types of myths: the good ones and the bad ones. The good ones are  those that, despite their inherent lack of authenticity, encourage, and inspire. The bad  ones could end up misguiding and causing more harm than good. So it is essential  to set the right expectations before we move forward with a choice of technology to  bet our career on.     It would help if you had advanced degrees to land a career in ET: Practical  knowledge and understanding of the technology and its applications across  various sectors can help you land a job faster than degrees. An advanced  degree  or  a  Ph.D.  can  help,  but  if  you  don't  have  them,  it  is  not  a  clear  disadvantage. Since most of these sectors don't have trained and experienced  professionals, your experience will grant you a definite advantage, and your  aptitude, problem-solving skills, and ability to grasp and deploy concepts  faster are vital.         My foundational knowledge is enough: Strong foundational knowledge,  along  with  a  good  understanding  of  business  challenges  and  models  for  deploying data and insights to solve problems, is essential.    One of my colleagues, a data scientist, got to work on an exciting IoT-based  vehicle  tracking  project  in  Indonesia  a  few  years  ago.  Instead  of  starting  from the available data, he instead got in touch with the end-users and the  business  decision-makers  to  understand  their  business  imperatives  and  decision-making inputs they work with for various operational aspects of  the logistics firm they were working for. Through his conversations, he could  sense  a  problem  that  everyone,  including  the  sales  engineering,  business          18      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  analysts, sales team, and even the end-users and decision-makers had missed.  This understanding led to the roll-out of a new feature that impressed the  customer and led to the logistics firm being able to understand the behaviors  of their driver better.    Business owners and tech decision-makers are always hungry for insights  and patterns that help deliver better customer experience, brand recognition,  and improved customer profitability. How many of us remember waiting in  endless queues to check-in at airports? Any airline that works to reduce this  time or guarantees the least amount of check-in time  even puts a number  to it  has a clear advantage over the competition. But are airlines doing it  today? The answer is no  at least I have not seen such an effort yet . Can  airlines do this? The answer is a definite yes. So, this is a precise instance of  a problem being defined. If you can suggest a solution to this challenge after  identifying the problem, you are on the right track.    Businesses  and  technology  companies  expect  employees  to  explore  and  suggest ways to expand business growth and potential. No matter where  you are in the value chain, it is essential to have a problem-solving aptitude.  While those who identify problems are sought after, those who solve them  are cherished and celebrated.         Only experts will be hired: Knowledge is essential, and a problem-solving  attitude is imperative. You needn't be an expert but be someone who can  learn fast, fail fast, and be back on track quickly. If only experts were getting  hired these days, many of us would have been still in job hunt mode. It is easy once you get in: You will be surprised to know about the percentage  of projects that fail in some of the industries that are early adopters or have  moved forward on their ET roadmap. The rate of failure was as much as 87  percent in 2016-17 in the field of IoT alone. The most common challenges  encountered were lack of understanding of the data landscape connected  with the project, inadequate attention being paid to planning aspects, lack of  collaboration between teams, using old or static datasets, misaligned project  expectations, ignoring small but essential elements and finally the use of  incorrect pricing models. In one of the projects I was involved in, which involved deploying sensors  inside a refrigerator, we forgot to account for the fact that the 4G frequencies  do  not  penetrate  the  thick  layer  of  insulation  that  sits  outside  a  typical  refrigeration unit. In another instance, we had to tamper with the wiring of an  SUV for deploying a VTS solution, which would have nullified the warranty  associated with the vehicle. Such instances can be extremely frustrating and  sometimes lead to a blame game, and entire projects could be scrapped in  days at the Proof of Concept  PoC  level itself. I can learn everything needed on the job itself: No, you can't. When I started  my career in ET, I used not just to read more but also to convert my learnings                                               The Best ET for Me and Some Myth Bursting      19      into slide decks that were posted on SlideShare. This served two purposes.  At one level, it helped me do a deep dive into the topic, and two, it offered a  way to validate my learnings  by having people engage with my slides .    You can never learn everything, even if you are entirely hands-on. For one of  my ET employers, I used to visit booths belonging to competitors at events  to study their messaging and pitch. I used to use this information along  with their online and social presence to figure out their marketing model.  I have visited countless LinkedIn profiles belonging to employees working  for competitors just to know how deep their projects were and how much  should we invest in differentiating ourselves. Reading books and talking  to my B-school professors used to help me contextualize this information  into aspects such as product development and funding pitches that I used to  make.    An ET professional needs to have an understanding of multiple contexts. In  case a problem is not getting sorted, one needs to change the context or take  the issue out of its immediate environment and tackle it there. You will be  surprised by how easily you can solve a problem once you do this. I can start at 5x or _x my current salary: I am not saying you cannot. But  the  chances  are  that  you  may  not.  If  you  are  planning  to  shift  to  ET  for  purely monetary reasons, then you might be disappointed during the initial  days. Salaries are a function of so many parameters chief of which is project  funding, and even in good times, funds are hard to come by. You get the  drift.     My current skills are not important, and I have to start over again: No  need to do that. Skills around project management, partner management,  leadership, DevOps, account management, business analysis, etc., are much  in demand in the world of ET. Transferable skills are essential for any job.  These are elements of your career that are recession and technology proof. If  you can demonstrate them in ample measure, your path to a cool ET career  becomes way smoother.     You only need to convince the recruiter and hiring manager about the depth  of your skillsets and how you will be able to put them to good use in your  new role. It will require a bit of convincing in some cases, but then again, that  is one of the reasons why I have written this book – to prepare you for those  situations and questions. I need to be a techie to get into emerging tech: In a technology like IoT, I  have worked with so many folks who do not have an academic background  in  technology  but  can  amply  compensate  that  with  some  other  skill  or  attribute. In roles such as pre-sales, sales, marketing, business analyst, PoC  project manager, project manager, consultant, and use case developer, you  can get in if you can prove that you can do justice to the requirements. There  is a massive demand for people who can translate tech into requirements and a        20      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  vehicle to address current and emerging challenges that businesses face or will face.

What if I take up a job and, in a few months, or years, the interest in that   tech wanes?    Ans.  This  is  a  possibility.  This  is  why  you  should  focus  on  developing  transferable skills and always be on the look for things going slow. Subsequent  chapters will deal with this topic in detail. Skills like project management,  marketing, sales, and many others mentioned above will never go out of  vogue. But a lot depends on how you leverage your position to make yourself  employable across technologies and companies.    To draw a parallel, no matter what the color of your parachute is, you still  need one when you are sky diving. Similarly, we need to be prepared at  all times. The world has become more uncertain than ever before now and  therefore it is better to be prepared for all eventualities than being surprised. If you had to bet on one tech, which would it be and why?  3.    Ans. IoT would top the lost. Since I have worked on and seen IoT at close  quarter so my answer would naturally be biased. But no matter how you  look at it, IoT makes a lot of sense. It is an enabler for other technologies and  outcomes. Besides unlike many other technologies, IoT has made significant  inroads  into  so  many  verticals  that  it  is  now  impossible  to  picture  them  without IoT.    Having said that, other technologies woven around cryptocurrencies and  blockchain, XR, and space tech are also here to stay. But these are just my  thoughts.  I  would  recommend  thorough  primary  research  to  ensure  you  figure out the answer on your own.   24      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code   Getting Prepared and Charting a Roadmap      25  Chapter 3 Getting  Prepared and  Charting a  Roadmap  "Start before you're ready."  ― Steven Pressfield  Introduction In  this  chapter,  we  will  learn  how  to  prepare  a  roadmap  for  your  career.  While  planning your career, you need to consider many factors and some of them are not  that obvious. A roadmap will help you plan, structure, and track your career better.  So instead of having a career that reacts to external forces, you have a career that is  driven from within and meets your deepest growth and professional development  needs. While preparing your career roadmap, you agree to take complete ownership of  everything there is including pros, cons, and future detours. You will be lucky if  you find someone to guide you here as you know your aspirations, strengths, and  weaknesses better than anyone. Before you begin, try and figure out the answers to  these questions:         What does success mean to you?    What  would  be  a  stature  of  expertise  that  would  satisfy  your  career   expectations?   26      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code        Have you visualized a clear vision on where you want to see yourself X years  down the line? X is a variable and can be defined by you as per your goals.      What value proposition would your career revolve around?    Structure In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:    Requirements for building a career roadmap      Understanding the importance of transitional skills        Steps in preparation      Measurement parameters Objectives After studying this unit, you should be able to:               Prepare a roadmap for your career    Understand the do's and don'ts of career roadmap planning    Figure out what an ET career roadmap looks like    Understand the significance of transitional skills    Understand the ways and means of measuring if your career is on the right   path or not  3.1 Getting started The first step in planning a mission is to understand one's motivation. A career in ET  is an excellent destination for someone who wants to continually throw themselves  at problems and seek solutions by applying mind, resources, and time. Never make  the mistake of entering this field if you want a monetarily fulfilling career. While this  can be one of the considerations, if it is the only one, my advice to you is to avoid  entering this field altogether. Years ago, when I started my ET journey, I looked at two aspects of my career. Where  I am now and where I wanted to be. I was not satisfied with the way my career  was shaping up as I was not getting enough chances to apply my potential despite  repeated attempts  yes, I know you have heard it before, and I am sure we have  all been there too . I wanted to work on a technology that kept me on my toes and  helped me take up learning once again:   Getting Prepared and Charting a Roadmap      27  Where I wanted    to be  Score  for the  current role    Aspect Technology   Where I was  Old,  much  used  and  less  amiable  to  innovation   to   Mint  fresh,  affords  a  chance  try  many  new  things,  work  on  a  technology  that  was  not  widespread or prevalent Blue ocean   across   Saturated  regions Low Multiple and mature None.  I  wanted  to  write   High   the playbook   Market s   Long term viability Playbooks  available  for various functions  and outcomes Learning   1  1  0 0  0  scope   of   High  Low  enrichment  Low Low Low  1 1 0  for   Medium  High  High   Job satisfaction Challenges Opportunities  growth  Score for each row: min: 0 max 5 Once I knew where I wanted to be and where I was, the differential provided me  the motivation I needed. The next step would be to figure out if a change of profile   or role  was enough or I needed to change my domain and technology. In the above  table, if your score in the above table is less than 5, you need to switch roles, vertical  and profile, if you can. In case you are a fresher or are going to sit in a placement drive or campus recruitment,  you can ignore the where I was a column and rank various aspects in the where I want to  be the column. But in this case, you need to rank each element based on its perceived  importance for you. If your score is higher than 10, you can start looking at taking  up a role in an emerging tech company or start-up or strive to do something on your  own.  Once you are clear about your motivation, you can start the planning process. The  first step for which would be to see which technology domain role you would  want to pursue. I would highly recommend referring to the table I have shared in  chapter two to figure out the best technology for you. When it comes to choosing a  role to go with, you have to keep a broader set of parameters in mind. Take a close  look at the skillsets and figure out the alignment there. Now you have to understand that some roles will be offered only to those with a  technical background and with relevant work experience. The rest of us will have to    28      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code          figure out a way of working out a workaround to get such roles. If you want to be a  blockchain scientist, it will help if you have some exposure to the tech. If you don't  have the proper exposure, you should be able to prove your ability to think in the  way they want the prospective candidate. Look at this ad I pulled out from Indeed. com for quantum computing scientist posted by Microsoft:       Background in quantum physics or quantum computing is helpful but not      You  will  help  our  goal  of  finding  new  killer  applications  for  quantum   required.  computing.  3.2 Requirements    engineering.     Experience in tackling complex problems in physics, computer science, and      At least two years of programming experience.    Degree  or  equivalent  in  computer  science,  engineering,  mathematics,   chemistry, or physics.     Delivers results in a collaborative, team environment.    They  are  looking  for  a  candidate  who  can  showcase  her  ability  to  meet  the  responsibilities of the role rather than meeting the specific academic and background  requirements. Advertised positions, where the recruiter is not particular about your  experience educational qualification, are often the best ones for you. Such positions  usually  belong  to  teams  and  companies  that  are  often  happy  to  accommodate  promising candidates and give them a challenging role and opportunity to prove  their mettle. This is one of the benefits of working in the ET field, and you should be  able to capitalize on this. Those without a technical background needn't be disappointed. You can start with  a non-tech role and then migrate to a techno-functional role and then move to a  technical role in case you can handle the transition well and can continue adding  value. I know of many folks who have started their ET journey in functional roles  and  then  have  moved  into  highly  technical  roles  by  mastering  technology  and  expanding their skillsets.  3.3 The significance of transitional skills Transferable skills are defined as those key capabilities or skills that can be applied  across industries, fields, or roles. As you grow up the corporate ladder, transferable  skills become as valuable as experience. Even at mid-management and early levels,  these skills remain a key differentiator. I know of many companies that are now  focusing on hiring candidates with these skills at all levels.   Getting Prepared and Charting a Roadmap      29  Me Ltd.  I came across a resume recently where the  candidate  presented  herself  as  a  business  analyst.  This  was  almost  like  a  label  she  was  happy  to  associate  with.  She  was  conveniently hiding the fact that she was  also a customer insights expert, proficient  negotiator  and  was  known  across  her  organization  for  her  ability  to  complete  projects on time. If you are only what your job wants you  to be, then you are doing a great disservice  to  your  potential.  But  why  do  we  stop  ourselves  from  highlighting  transferable  skills? Some of us do mention such skills  during  interviews  but  that  is  too  late  in  the cycle. Let your resume talk about them  before you do.  Portable skillsets that you can carry with you on the go and deploy in your new role  are the ones that are powering job descriptions in the ET world. Since experienced  candidates are hard to come by, companies are looking to hire candidates who can  hit the ground running and evolve without giving room for latency in performance. According  to  a  recent  survey  by  career  management  firm  LiveCareer,  many job seekers are unable to even  present  their  transferable  skills  on  their resumes. Further, many of them  couldn't  figure  out  how  their  skills  could  be  applied  to  other  industries.  In  a  poll  of  1,519  respondents  who  were job seekers conducted from May  6-11,  2020,  57%  of  respondents  were  not able to highlight their transferable  skills with confidence. As much as 58%  didn't have a clue on how to present  transferable skills on their resume and  58%  lacked  the  confidence  in  their  ability to find new jobs in industries  where their skills would apply. This  is  therefore  a  clear  problem.  Many of us are so focused on our core  job  requirements  that  we  knowingly  wear a blinder to avoid losing focus. Here are the top transferable skills that you will  need to have and prove:                           Advanced communication skills    Analytical skills: ability to think and see patterns and forecast trends     Project management     Time management    Leadership     Teamwork     Critical thinking     Adaptability     Negotiation        Public speaking   Industry expertise    30      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  to   disappointments   Ingredients in the    recipe for a good career      Coaching and mentoring    Ability to conceptualize use cases      3.4 Proving your transferable skills foray       A career plan      A roadmap for achieving the plan      A clear vision      A set of goals with timelines     Willingness to learn      Willingness to help others     Ability  to  rise  above  discomfort  and       Tons of ideas – good and bad      Courage      A dash of fun      Patience and passion in equal measure   Mix the above and add liberal quantities  of  hope  and  keep  stirring  with  a  hint  of  passion and ample hard work. Keep an eye  on the clock.   In  case  you  are  fresher  or  veteran  planning  into  ET,  or  someone who wants to simply switch  technologies  within  ET,  it  is  essential  to establish your transferable skills as a  foundation for bagging a role. Here are  a few things you do towards achieving  that goal. Get  proof  that  can  be  proven:  Work  experience, project experience, or work  samples that show beyond doubt that  you have what you are talking about.  Establishing a direct correlation to the  role you want to bag is essential. The  stronger the co-relation, the better will  be  your  competitiveness  and  chances  of making it. Endorsements  and  showcasing  your  body of work on social media can go  a long way. Make sure that you get the  endorsements  from  the  right  people  who  are  credible,  are   if  possible   influencers themselves, and have had a first-hand experience of your work and can  vouch for you. If your endorsement is vague, then it doesn't help. Endorsements  can also be presented in your resume. Many of us do not use endorsements in our  resumes, so it gets hidden and therefore rendered uselessly. Certifications can also help. I have met many aspirants who have blamed their prospective employers for not  seeing their transferable skills. But always remember that the onus of proving the  existence of such skills within you lies with you and not your employer. Take every  job application you file as an attempt to understand better how you are evolving in  your journey to get a job in ET or to transition to a more challenging and fulfilling  role while strengthening your ability to prove your credentials. Someday you will be  someone who doesn't have to prove anything, and I hope you get there sooner but  till such a time, you need to stay focused.   Getting Prepared and Charting a Roadmap      31  You have not just to prove the existence of such but also tell your prospective employer  how you will apply that skill in your new role or to address a new challenge. This is  an important thing to do. During a recent interview, I posed this question to several  candidates who I interviewed. Just 3 candidates out of 11 were able to convince me  about this. There are plenty of free courses from e-learning sites such as Coursera, which can  help give you a foothold in the industry. It is purely up to you to initiate the next  steps to strengthen this relationship and take it to a logical conclusion. 3.5 Things to avoid No  matter  where  you  are  in  your  career,  certain  rules  are  sacrosanct.  We  must  understand them early:       The blame game: If you have not made it past an interview, use that as an  avenue to understand what went wrong and fix that problem the next time.  Blaming someone or a situation is the laziest thing to do. But it also takes  your attention away from putting an effort to improve things.     Remember that you are making a massive leap so you need to be prepared to  do way more than you usually would. As they say, what got you here won't  get you there. It is as simple as that.     Never give up: If you want something that bad, you should be ready to put   up with disappointments and learn from them.     Thinking that learning formally or otherwise has nothing to do with your   transition to an ET role or getting your next role.  3.6 Things to do       Always look ahead for inspiration; look at someone who is doing well in that   field or someone to emulate.    Stay positive and optimistic.    Network and connect but with the right elements of communication. If you  are sending an invite to someone over say LinkedIn, write a note to them  stating why you are reaching out. Establish a context for the invite. Here is a  sample note: o  Dear, I saw a post of yours on LinkedIn the other day [or some other  factor that you liked about them]. It was an eye-opener for me and  helped  me  understand  the  dynamics  connected  with  Smart  Ledger  [tell them why you liked or what you found interesting about them]. It  will be a pleasure to have you as a first degree connect. Do accept this  invite.                     32      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code             Have a great day,   Regards,   John Doe  o  Don't forget to thank them once they accept the invite.    Figure 3.1: Career resource mapping components and connected areas   Questions you need to answer             How important is an ET role for me?    What different tasks am I going to do to attain my goals?    Who could be my potential mentor?    What aspects of my professional or personal career am I going to change to   get there faster?     How am I going to expand my network?    How am I going to expand my learning horizon?    What changes will an ET role bring within me?        You don't need to bring about a sudden change within you within a short period.  Instead, focus on changing smaller aspects of your life to condition your mind. A  colleague of mine who wanted to shift to an ET role took a break from work and  went backpacking in Vietnam for almost two weeks. After his return, he was ready  to begin his transition.   Getting Prepared and Charting a Roadmap      33                   3.7 Steps in preparation       Planning:  Involves  everything  from  deciding  which  tech  to  work  on  to   which company to work within which vertical     Learning: Formal  certifications  and informal  on the job , by shadowing   someone and by volunteering.     Networking: Connect with folks who can guide you and even hire you.    Applying and introspecting: Examine what worked and what didn't and   restart the process with enthusiasm.  Things to do       Be ready to read, write, listen, speak, and engage more. You need to be seen   more often and connect with people.     Remember, this is stage 0, and you still have a long way to go. Be prepared   mentally.     Focus on networking. Build your online and offline networks so that as and  when you are ready to make that leap, you have someone to talk to or send  your resume to. But don't ever connect to share your resume.     Never network to take favors. The basic tenet of networking is to give more  than you can receive. Be ready to help others as you like to be helped by  others as well. Never shy away from helping anyone. But don't help someone  to get something in return from that person.  Remember, you need to bring a perceptible change in your life. And nothing less  than a complete reinvention would do.  3.8 Preparing a career roadmap in ET? Now that you are certain about making a career move towards ET, it is time to  frame a roadmap for it. The roadmap should necessarily have milestones, options to  measure progress and to initiate course correction mid-way. Each emerging technology needs a different approach. For instance, for a career in  IoT, you need to start by understanding the application landscape and use cases, and  IoT is a use case driven technology. The more you appreciate its varied applications,  the better suited you would be to get a role in a company that is working on IoT. This  is true to some extent about blockchain as well. However, for a position in AR VR,    34      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  you have to understand human behavior in depth. You have to connect with these  core aspects of the tech you are planning to get into and internalize them:   Figure 3.2: The ET career evolution chart  The chart above gives you a high-level view of how an ET career evolves. What it  doesn't capture is the dynamics involved at each stage. As part of your preparation  process, set milestones, and timelines for each stage. Ideally, you shouldn't take more    Getting Prepared and Charting a Roadmap      35  than a year to land a job, which means that you have approximately 340 days to get  a role in ET. You can reduce the number of days in case you are confident enough  about landing a role faster. You must remember that your current profile also plays  a role in determining how soon can you land a new tech job. When I decided to move on to my second role in emerging tech, I was open to newer  technologies. In my second outing, I was able to secure a position in just under eight  months. I was also able to try out more unique avenues such as space-tech and Edu- tech as well with start-ups. My interactions with them and the whole process of  onboarding someone was a real eye-opener. More on that later. So, once you have decided on the timelines, factor in other variables such as state  of industry market, your compensation  ideal expected minimum  your ability to  move geographies, etc. Go about methodically deciding answers to these questions  and consult people wherever possible. In the world of ET, there are no short-cuts as far as the evolution of your career is  concerned. But you can hasten things up by expanding your skillsets and your role.  When I took up my first ET role, I was clear about one thing that I need to keep on  doing new things to learn how not to fail. One of my first tasks was to establish our  brand in a region as big as the Asia Pacific, and we wanted to have a strong foothold  in India as part of that objective. To accomplish such a large goal, I followed Michelangelo's instruction. The sculpture  is already complete within the marble block before I start my work. It is already there, and  I have to chisel away the superfluous material. This is what he once said, and that is  exactly what I did. I tried to remove everything that was not ET material from my  career. It is not that easy but that is the approach I took. While I was dealing with new challenges, my career was evolving and taking shape.  In between, I gave it that extra thrust by taking up new activities like managing  partners and alliances, doing project management and price discovery, pre-sales,  sales, and finally acting as a spokesperson for the organization. 3.9 Career acceleration The speed at which you move across your planned roadmap is called career velocity.  This simple equation can determine it: v=phases covered time taken  For instance, if you cover 3 phases of your roadmap in 200 days, then your velocity  will be: 3 200, which would be 0.015 phases day This is close to the ideal rate which is 0.014. This formula only applies in the first 4  phases of your career and can be repeated once you change roles or tech.    36      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code Things to remember        each stage      Find out what will take me there faster. A certification? A project? A mentor?     Be pragmatic and not desperate     The roadmap should have proper timelines and scope for introspection at                  Once you have established your credentials in the ET space, you can move  on. Ideally, it would help if you moved on before ET becomes ET  Established  Tech      Read how others in such industries and tech have shaped their careers. This   information is available online.      Keep  an  eye  on  learning.  Learning  is  not  something  that  happens  automatically, and that is a wrong way to approach this essential parameter    Keep moving: maintain a good career velocity at all times.

In the next  chapter, we will be looking at the specific needs to make a transition and ways to  fulfill them. To help you understand your career preferences better, I have added a  worksheet at the end of this chapter. Compare your responses to this worksheet with  that from chapter one and two and see if anything has changed since you started    Getting Prepared and Charting a Roadmap      37  reading this book. This is an essential exercise. It will help you understand how you  are evolving through introspection. Keep these responses handy as you move across  chapters of this book. Finally, have fun where ever you are and whatever you do. Recharge your mind and  body often and be excited about the possibilities your career can afford. Enjoy every  phase and always be prepared to help yourself and others when needed. Question and answers 1.  Can I evolve transferable skills?     Ans.  Yes,  you  can  identify  such  skills  and  work  on  them  as  areas  for    improvement. You can use the worksheet provided at the end of this chapter  for that purpose. And don't worry you will get plenty of help from later  chapters of this book.            2.  Can I prepare my career roadmap?   Ans.  Yes,  why  not.  Everything  mentioned  here  is  for  guidance.  You  can  prepare your own based on your priorities and goals. This is why I have  given you a self-assessment questionnaire to help you figure that bit out.  3.  What impact do periods of recession have on my career roadmap?   Ans. Such periods provide a context for introspection and to analyze the  pace at which your career is moving along. If you have made a job transition  during a recession or your career roadmap has not changed, you have some  new consulting opportunities, you have added a few new certifications or  have even identified a new career stream, and you are on the right track. It is  not that easy though as many factors influence your roadmap and recession  is just one of them. I will be sharing more information on this in some of the  later chapters.  Career roadmap: self-assessment questionnaire Part 1: Who am I and what are my strengths?

Let me begin by outlining these areas: which are skills,  aptitude, competency building, strategic and tactical thinking capacity enhancement.  The industry will be looking not at employees, but future leaders who can manage,  lead and shape the disruption that is underway around us in terms of technology,  application, customer experience, intuitive engagement of stakeholders, and see- saw market dynamics. Before we delve into each of these requirements, let's take a more in-depth look at  the way the markets around us are evolving. With the emergence of newer and more  comfortable means of digital engagement, the world has come closer. Gone are the  days when a regime change in Venezuela would have only impacted folks from that  country and maybe a few neighbors. Today, geopolitical events in faraway nations  hold the potential to unleash tremors in the social-economic landscape that binds  national economies and people around the world. No one is insulated from these  tremors — not even the people of an autocratic theocracy like North Korea. More on  this in the next chapter. In  such  an  environment,  you  do  have  a  choice.  Either  you  can  let  these  forces  destabilize and crumble your aspirations, or you can opt to be a champion surfer  who can ride this wave, rescue a few stragglers and emerge unscathed on the shore.    44      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  These tsunamis of change and disruption are now making landfall faster, giving  very less reaction time to people trapped in them, and the folks on the coast, and  both are at risk. My generation has already survived three prolonged recessions, a luxury that only  a few generations can boast of. These days recession seems to be a prevalent trend,  and there is always a fear of one lurking around the corner. The upheaval that a  period of recession unleashes shakes and stirs the system from within. Folks who  survive such periods emerge transformed in many ways, learning to survive or even  thrive on a combination of factors. To  survive  in  a  world  that  constantly  sits  at  the  cusp  of  change  emerging  tech  companies have evolved into highly adaptive entities. Such companies have learned  to manage an environment that blends regulatory, legal, operational, environmental,  supply chain, competition, and tech variables. It is not an easy task and this is one  of the reasons why ET companies are peopled by folks who are at ease with change  and churn. I am speaking relatively here as compared to their counterparts in the  traditional tech world. Also,  thanks  in  part  to  the  forces  unleashed  by  digital  globalization,  periods  of  recession are here to stay, and we might as well embrace them as the new normal.  Now I am not trying to paint a bleak picture here or looking at this from a pessimist's  view. I am instead of forcing you to be on your toes and see the broader opportunities  that a downturn brings. If you can understand this part of the narrative and build an  ET mindset, you have got it made. Structure In this chapter we will discuss the following topics:         Objectives After studying this unit, you should be able to:           Setting a personal transformation agenda    Identifying the requirements for this effort    Connect with knowledge repositories and learning efforts    Locating people and resources than can help     Understand the context of personal transformation    Learn how it can be enacted successfully    Learn how to make the best use of all available resources   Identifying the Requirements and Getting Help      45  4.1 Learning from evolution To get clues on what the future holds, one needs to investigate the past. Evolution is  the best place to look at these clues.  Everyone knows the T-Rex or Tyrannosaurus Rex. This majestic dinosaur has haunted  the  dreams  of  generations  of  kids.  Thanks  to  movies  and  focused  on  scientific  research,  it  is  today  the  most  popular  and  well-known  dinosaur.  Here  is  some  interesting trivia. Before T-Rex became popular, there was another dinosaur that  was all set to compete and perhaps even more popular.  T-Rex and Spinosaurus were both discovered and named within a decade of each  other. Between the years 1910 and 1914, Ernst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach an  aristocrat  from  the  Bavarian  region  of  Germany  discovered  nearly  45  species  of  dinosaurs  and  other  species  during  his  lengthy  trips  to  Saharan  Egypt.  We  are  speaking about an era before air conditioners and Stromer was not in the best of  health when he undertook these trips. Among the dinosaurs he unearthed were a couple of skeletons of what appeared  to be a super predator with long jaws and conical teeth that interlocked. This new  dinosaur had something else which continues to baffle paleontologists to this day.  It had a six-foot sail-like structure on its back supported by spines. No one knows  the  exact  use  of  this  sail  for  this  unique  dinosaur.  Stromer  called  the  dinosaur  Spinosaurus aegyptiacus. Stromer's specimens were put up for display in the Bavarian State Collection in  central  Munich.  During  the  Second  World  War,  as  Germany  was  being  bombed  extensively  by  allied  forces,  he  pleaded  with  the  museum  director  to  have  the  specimens shifted from Munich to someplace that was beyond the range of allied  bombers. Unfortunately, the director refused and by April 1944, all his fossils were  converted into dust and debris and what remained of his work notes, few unclear  photographs, and drawings. As Germany emerged from the ruins of the war, the only agenda the nation had  was the reconstruction and thus, Stromer was gradually forgotten and his work  consigned to the annals of history. In the meantime, in the 1960s amidst renewed  interest in paleontology, teams started finding specimens of T-Rex from Western  North America. By 1990, the first complete fossil  nearly 80 percent complete  was  discovered in Montana. The animal started capturing the public imagination and  made innumerable appearances in movies including its most famous appearance in  the Steven Spielberg classic Jurassic Park.  Spinosaurus was all but forgotten and never managed to get any attention as there  were no specimens to showcase in museums. One cannot but imagine how things  would have been if Stromer's specimens hadn't been destroyed. Spinosaurus could  have been the reigning champion of public imagination as far as dinosaurs were    46      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  concerned with T-Rex coming in a close second. Spinosaurus is slowly getting its  day in the sun. The species was featured prominently in the third installment of  Jurassic Park and many on-field discoveries by paleontologists such as Nizar Ibrahim  have helped piece together the life and times of the animal when it roamed the earth.  Coming back to T. rex, it lived in the late Cretaceous period about 65 million years  ago. What many of us may not know is that there was once an enormous unrelated  dinosaur  that  once  roamed  North  America  that  kept  Tyrannosaurus  rex  from  achieving its evolutionary potential for millions of years. This dinosaur, called Siats  meekerorum, is part of a group of giant predators known as Carcharodontosaurus. During  Siats'  reign,  T.  rex  had  not  yet  evolved.  Its  tyrannosaur  ancestors  were  scrawny animals, no bigger than a large dog. Siats terrorized the landscape that it  ruled and kept the population and evolutionary aspirations of smaller dinosaurs  like T.rex in check.   At  some  point  in  the  Late  Cretaceous,  however,  Siats  went  extinct,  clearing  the  ecosystem of its top predator. Tyrannosaurs capitalized this opportunity to occupy  this niche and evolved into the giants they went on to become. They became the  apex predator ruling a massive swath of territory while their close relatives ruled  parts of what became Mongolia later. There are two lessons for us here — one from the perspective of Siats and another  from the T.rex point of view. Siats was the top predator, till some events led to its  extinction.  Similarly,  many  folks  have  touched  the  peak  of  their  careers  and  are  sitting happily in the belief that it is going to be a go with the flow approach from  here on and as long as they are in the good books of their superiors and senior  management, nothing can harm their career trajectory. During  times  of  recession,  otherwise  uncommon  scenarios  become  common.  Entrenched people who have long survived in profiles managing people and emails  are asked to leave, clearing the way for a new set of folks to take over. From the  T.rex's perspective, it was the animal that evolved faster to occupy the niche left  behind by Siats  there could have been other competitors . In the geological world, mass extinctions occur frequently, and it is now widely  understood that they are a norm. There have been five mass extinctions so far, and  in between these extinctions, there are also events like Ice ages and huge volcanic  eruptions that species must cope with. In our world, a recession is the equivalent of  mass extinction. During each recession, the ones that are ready to change and adapt  to their new environment faster are the ones that live to tell the tale.   Identifying the Requirements and Getting Help      47  You will be surprised to know how many of us understand this as a concept but fail  to apply the learning in our lives:  Aspect Challenge  Where to start the process  of identifying needs? How to think?  What to do  My identified needs have  nothing  to  do  with  my  current profile role  What to do  See what you have been doing so far and shortlist the skills,  tactics, and learning that you want to carry forward.  Think  from  a  deficiency  perspective. Admit  that  you  lack  something  that  you  need  to  stay  relevant  in  the  future.  Treat  the  whole  process  from  here  on  a  journey  in  better  understanding  your  needs  and  aspirations  as  a  part  of  understanding yourself as a person and a professional.  Start changing a few aspects of your professional life – read  more, introspect more, go for long walks drives, free your  mind for it to imagine. Isolation for a few hours can work  wonders for your thinking.  So? You are planning your future and not your past. So, look  ahead and not behind.   Table 4.1: Common challenges related to an ET career  When it comes to having an ET career, you need to adopt a structured approach that  considers such digressions as a recession. You can begin by identifying requirements  fulfilling which will take you towards a more fulfilling career faster. A simple way of identifying your needs and requirements for an ET career is by  comparing  a  job  description  of  your  current  role  with  a  desired  one.  From  this  exercise, you can identify the significant gaps that exist in your existing profile that  have to be addressed on priority. Remember, you are attempting to breach a fortress  with a high wall, and it takes some effort even to figure out where you can start your  climb from. The next step involves breaking down each of the desired profile attributes into a  set of skills. Finally, see what you need to do to match the skills and qualities and  surpass them. Pitfalls       Do not get too pessimistic while doing your self-evaluation. If this exercise  is not done in a controlled way, it might lead to a severe case of inferiority  complex     You are not required to hate your current role or attach a significant degree      of negativity to it. This leads to a waste of your energies   48      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code        There is no need to start comparing yourself with someone who has made  it. Such comparisons have never helped anyone unless you are inspired by  their achievements   Once you are done with this, make a list of the skills or other upgrades you may  need. Start by preparing a chart like the one given below: Current state   Desired state   Skills tools Python  Kibana   Malware analysis   Data crunching   Photoshop, 3DS Max, Substance   Painter and Mudbox  Tools for imagery analysis  Beginner  Novice  Beginner   Low  Medium proficiency   Low to medium  Expert  Expert  Proficient  Expert  Expert   Proficient   Table 4.2: Skills: current state vs. the desired state  Once you are done with this, prepare another column that talks about what you can  do to address that gap. It could mean a certification, a short course, or a project that  you take up so that your skills get upgraded. 4.2 Requirement analysis In addition to what has been written before about identifying your needs, you also  need to do a requirement analysis with the diligence of a business analyst. Your ET  career requirement analysis can be spread across these stages:         Figure out what your next big step is.    Validate  alignment  with  overall  short-term  career  mission  along  with   essential requirement gathering and supporting activities.          Determine the criticality of each step process requirement.     Identify risk mitigation and recovery strategies  risk here refers to factors that  may impede your transition to an ET role  work-related travel, for instance .  Recovery appears in the context of interviews that could be demotivating or  any other factor that slows you down . Identify resource requirements  time, money for courses\certifications .    This exercise should align with your overall goal and should help you do micro- level planning.       Identifying the Requirements and Getting Help      49  Curiosity on-demand  4.3 Agenda: Return on investment Like  every  corporate  or  start-up  venture, it is essential to measure your  RoI  at  every  stage.  Else  the  exercise  might not yield the results you want,  might  go  in  the  wrong  direction,  or  even fail. When it comes to progress,  you  need  to  set  weekly  goals  for  yourself  and  track  your  progress  towards it.  If you have added a new  certificate to your CV, you should be  able to determine how much value was  added to your overall ET pitch. Thus,  every effort that you make should be  made keeping RoI in mind. RoI could  be measured in the short or long term,  but  it  should  be  measured  none  the  less.  Many  people  I  spoke  to  before  writing  this book didn’t subscribe to an organized  knowledge  gathering  process.  They  only  sought  information  on  a  topic  when  the  situation  demanded  it.  Further,  no  effort  was made to learn anything from outside  their immediate sphere of work. It is not a  good practice to subscribe to such practices.  Unless you follow a pre-established pattern  of knowledge gathering and absoption, you  will not be able to retain it for the long run.  This  basically  means  that  anything  you  learn on-demand may not stay with you  for long. Instead of this, build an appetite  for knowledge that is sustainable beyond  individual  episodes.  Don’t  learn  for  sake  of  work.  Instead  learn  for  enrichment,  feeding your mind and for sustaining your 4.4 Identifying the helpers, networks, and  information sources Information is nothing but a valuable signal that you can tap into. We live in a  world of noise, and today, our success depends on how we can synthesize a signal  from all the noise around us. It is essential to know what you want to get from the  information you seek for you to get the information you seek. The first step towards  any goal that you wish to achieve is to organize your data and sources. In his book Curious: the desire to know and why your future depends on it, author  Ian  Leslie  builds  a  strong  case  for  cultivating  a  desire  to  know.  In  an  interesting  paragraph in the book, he tells us how creativity is initiated as a combination. He  quotes Scottish philosopher David Hume who pointed out that there was nothing  unique about the idea of gold or a mountain. But the combination of the two, a gold  mountain piques our curiosity. He goes on to say that at the very basic level, our new ideas are made up of existing  ideas, for instance, to imagine a winged horse, you need to have an idea of wings and  horses, to create a smartphone, you need to know about computers and applications.  So, the more ideas you have the newer ideas you will get, and these ideas come from    50      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  the knowledge you store or are exposed to. On the other hand, if your cross-sectoral  knowledge is less, your ability to generate ideas could suffer. So, there are no two  ways about it. You need to build and expand your knowledge base to get access to a  new trove of ideas. A simple yet powerful thought.  To  go  towards  your  goal  faster,  you  need  to  establish  a  network  of  people  and  information sources that can help you gain momentum in this journey. The helpers  could include mentors, teachers, colleagues, books, portals, counselors, and others.  Let us look at some of the folks and information sources that you need in detail:  Source  Teachers professors  academicians   Colleagues   Books  Portals   Help  They  can  help  you  validate  your  approach;  provide  new  points  for  your  pitch  as  also  unique  insights  into  market  dynamics.  To connect you with the right people; provide support and  validation To get new ideas, improve your contextual awareness as also  gain new problem-solving skills  You should ideally visit at least three portals that give you  news  and  updates  from  the  industry  to  ensure  you  stay  updated Career counselors can provide you with a fresh perspective  Counselors Social media influencers  Can  connect  you  with  the  right  folks  and  update  you  on   trends  Table 4.3: Sources and the nature of help you can get from them  4.5 How to connect with them? In case they are already in your network, you can always reach out to them. If they  are not, then you need to find them and find out ways to connect with them. The  easiest way to connect would be through LinkedIn or Twitter. But a more productive  method would be to see where and when they are speaking or simply participating  and reach out to them at the venue. Doing courses from leading B-schools that require a visit to the campus is the best  way of connecting with professors. This is one relationship that will guide you for  the rest of your career. I have always turned to my professors whenever I was dealing  with a significant challenge in my professional life. All thanks to the courses I had  done in these institutions. I have always made it a point to stay connected with these  professors, wishing them, sharing my career progress, and meeting them whenever  I could. Doing short classroom courses from top-tier institutions is indeed a great way of  networking as well. I once attended a course at a prominent B-school where I got to    Identifying the Requirements and Getting Help      51  spend time with C-level folks with over 20 years of experience. I was not just able  to learn but also leverage that network for various other projects I started well after  the course was over. During the course, I made it a point to stay visible and network  helping my batchmates wherever and whenever I could. 4.6 Mentors All successful people have mentors in their lives. A mentor can be someone who  provides you specific inputs to improve in a certain aspect of life or someone who  coaches you, mentors you and prepares you for life or to take on a challenge that you  are facing. Parents are our first set of mentors, but as we move along in our lives, we  do encounter people who help us along. When aiming for anything big in life, it is always advisable to have a mentor. A  mentor could be a friend, a teacher, a relative, a manager, a colleague, or a classmate.  Mentors motivate us and give us that added backing to keep us focused on the task  at hand. It is always advisable to work with mentors whenever you can. Mentors can  be involved in planning and validation, and unlike every other category of people I  have listed earlier, mentors will be more deeply involved in every activity that you  undertake and help you course-correct or gain confidence if required. On sites like LinkedIn and some job portals, you get connected to mentors or people  who can help you. At least that's what they claim. It is better to get mentors offline  and not rely exclusively on these sites to help you. 4.7 Books Books hold the keys to one's mind. I don't think I will ever stop recommending  reading to people. You are reading this book, and that is a good sign, but more  importantly, read books of any type or genre. Let me outline the most important  benefits of reading if you haven't figured this out yet. Now I am referring to reading  a book here and not reading articles or even the newspaper [those are important  activities but reading a book is above all]. Benefits are as follows:       Heightened  contextual  awareness:  sometimes  we  get  overwhelmed  by  the context of a problem or a challenge we are facing. Books help us think  in multiple contexts and directions, thereby making you think in various  dimensions and lightening the psychological load on your mind. You will  thus get an answer faster perhaps by combing two ideas as mentioned earlier.  People who read can collect and organize their thoughts more quickly as that  is what they do when they read.     Reading reduces wastage of time spent on social media and other weapons      of mass distraction    52      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code              Reading gives you access to discussion and conversation points, helping you  avoid situations involving those awkward silences. It will also help connect  better with people who matter such as an audience for your speech. Imagine  discussing a book you have read with an influencer. It will always present  you in a better light.     Reading expands your thought frontiers, and as someone said: an expanded   mind cannot contract to its original dimensions.     Don't ever underestimate the power of a book to change your life. This alone   should be a reason why you should pick up a book today.  Portals are a good source of current information to keep you posted on the latest  from the industry. Some of the recommended portals are given in Table 4.4:  Portal techcrunch.com  lightreading.com blinkist.com  thinkwithgoogle.com  mashable.com medium.com krebsonsecurity.com  businessInsider.com  thenextweb.com  venturebeat.com  techradar.com coindesk.com newsbtc.com space.com news.mit.edu topic  artificial-intelligence2 technical.ly  Focus  Emerging trends and tech  Focus on smart tech including IoT, 5G, AI and VR Blinkist lets you read key nuggets of wisdom and select  extracts  from  over  3500  nonfiction  books  in  15  min  or  under.

Identifying the Requirements and Getting Help      53  4.8 Using social media Social media influencers are another source of inputs and guidance. Many of them  are willing to help, and it is advisable to reach out to them. How do you go about  selecting a social media influencer? Well, to begin with, you need to look at the  aspects given in Table 4.5: Aspect  Score  Technology topic  Quality of network Frequency of posting on topics Quality of content posted  Grasp of trends  Geography of operation Any other important trait you feel is important  Table 4.5: How to select a social media influencer to follow  To reach out to them, you need to begin by following them and liking their posts and  updates. If you do it frequently enough, you might create a favorable opinion about  yourself before you are formally introduced. I have seen people rushing invites with  half-baked emails and default templates across LinkedIn and Twitter, and in case  the invite gets accepted, a resume is sent within a picosecond with another soulless  cover note, which is as personalized as a spam SMS from a real-estate company.  Such attempts are a huge turnoff and indicate a lack of patience, decorum, respect,  and empathy. The book What not to do on social media would outnumber it's what to do on social  media counterpart by at least 1000 pages. This is because people find new and unique  ways to offend others, breach decorum, and take flights of fantasy using messages  copied from instant messaging apps and other places.  As I have said before, you cannot get something out of nothing. The universe did  come from a Big Bang, but there was something there before it  Google Hawking  points in the Cosmic Microwave Background. You will not be disappointed . To begin  engaging these influencers, you need to invest in the relationship. Start developing  a genuine interest in the influencer you want to engage and always admire their  work before you seek favor. When you are sending an invite, keep the note personal,  short, and crisp. Thank them once they accept the invitation and never ‘throw' your  CV at them once they accept your invite. Point to remember: any form of communication that is not personalized is spam.  It is one of the lessons that life teaches you – personalization is the essence of any    54      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  communication. More your ability to personalize something, the more will be the  success you meet with. I encourage you to read a book called Targeted written by  Cambridge  Analytica  Whistleblower  Brittany  Kaiser  [yes,  they  are  the  same  guys  who got Facebook into their 3456th crisis]. This book is her own story on how the  whole episode of US elections being manipulated unfolded. A sub-narrative deal  with elections turning into a scientifically executed segmented targeting exercises.  Audiences  are   pardon  the  expression   sliced  and  diced  according  to  various  attributes to derive their willingness to be influenced by a specific message and a  call to action. There is a lesson in there for you and me. So, remember to personalize every communication you send and every conversation  you are part of. If you are willing to take care of the audience, the audience will  also take care of you. But then, the reason for you to personalize communication  shouldn't just be a narrow focus on what is in it for you. Instead, you should always  focus on the larger picture – the one that deals with your growth as an individual  and a professional. Staying invested in communication is the best way of evolving  and growing, and this is one aspect that can never be overlooked or accorded less  imagination. 4.9 Managing your network How many times have we forgotten the people who we have in our network who  could help us in some way or have reached out for help at some point? If you expect  your network to help you, always be prepared to help them as well. You need to  create a visual map of your contacts in your network, along with their field of work  and the people in their network. LinkedIn had a feature to for this years ago. It has hence been discontinued. LinkedIn  has also closed the API connected with this, so building a social map is now an offline  exercise. You will have to devote some time to it. Your map should necessarily have  all details of people in your network, including their place of work, tech, years of  experience, influencing power, thought leadership capabilities, etc. You should be  able to pull this information out from say a spreadsheet whenever needed.  4.10 Working in reverse gear There  are  two  ways  of  achieving  a  goal.  One  is  to  work  forwards  by  assigning  milestones, and another is by working backward from a goal. Working backward  starts by visualizing your goal and then establishing the milestones in reverse. There  is no rule which says you have to only work in one direction to achieve your goal.  You can mix these two paths without losing focus on either and work on multiple  fronts to target your goal.    Identifying the Requirements and Getting Help      55  Trade secret: Always try and speak to your fellow passenger during the flight  if  they appear comfortable . More often than not, there will at least be a couple of folks  who can help you in some way. 4.11 A lesson in focus from Yahoo In late 2006, Yahoo's Senior Vice President Brad Garlinghouse wrote a scathing internal  memo urging the company to revisit its priorities while clarifying its vision. The  company, according to him had spread itself thin like peanut butter across myriad  opportunities that were arising in the tech world. The memo became famous as the  Peanut Butter Manifesto and outlined Yahoo's lack of focus and perhaps direction.  He warned that the company was losing ground to rivals like Google because Yahoo  was not focusing on anything in particular and was chasing too many things. The  problems that Garlinghouse highlighted continued to plague Yahoo till its ultimate  sale to Verizon. There  is  an  important  lesson  in  this  memo  for  all  of  us.  If  we  lack  clarity  and  decisiveness in our approach towards our goal s  and spread ourselves thin chasing  mirages everywhere, we may sink faster than Borealopelta Markmitchelli. Focus is a  priceless asset especially if you are chasing a big and priceless goal. Conclusion In this chapter, we have learned how to tap into various sources that will help us  in our journey towards an enriching career in ET. In the next chapter, you will learn  how to deal with destabilizing headwinds. By working with influencers and others  who can help, we can reduce the distance between us and our goals which also  mean you will save on precious time and effort. Putting time and effort in the wrong  direction leads to loss of enthusiasm in addition to other resources thus, it is essential  to involve authorities to validate your journey. No matter which route you take, ensure that your foundation is built on knowledge,  perseverance, and humility. These three traits will take you far in your professional  and personal journeys. Question and answers 1.  What is the best way to approach a potential mentor?     Ans. You will have to be open and clear about what you hope to expect    from an interaction or help from a mentor. No matter where you reach out  to them, make sure you approach them with plenty of clarity and the areas  where you need their help. If you are ambitious, passionate, and know-how  to hold a conversation, things will work out faster. If they are unable to help    56      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  you, thank them and move on. There are plenty of people out there who can  help you in some way.                           2.  What should be my knowledge gathering strategy?   Ans. That's an easy one. Here you go:     Read a book every single day. The topic doesn't matter as long as it   makes you think.         Bookmark the sites I have shared earlier and visit at least 3 of them   each day. Identify unproductive activities that are a drain on your time. Eliminate  them. Unless you have free time, you will not be able to make time to  do productive work.     Wherever possible, rely on a book or an e-book for answers questions.    Ask questions. Express your curiosity in situations that demand it.    Listen to at least one podcast a week.  3.  Any tips on sustaining my relationship with my network?   Ans. Focus on giving whenever you can. Sometimes people call out for help  from their network and you should chip in whenever you can. Try sharing  good  pieces  of  information  and  never  spam  them  with  your  posts.  Give  recommendations, ask for them, and thank people who have helped you  publicly.   Dealing with Headwinds and Drawing a Career Change Action Plan      57  Chapter 5 Dealing with  Headwinds and  Drawing a Career  Change Action Plan  Introduction Every phase in your pursuit of a career in ET teaches you lessons that you would  have otherwise missed. As I have mentioned before, we are living in times that are  highly volatile and change inducing. Headwinds that can make you falter and drop  your plans are always around these days, and it is up to us to incorporate them into  our planning cycles. Now some experts feel that headwinds and tailwinds balance  each other out in the long run. I hold a slightly divergent view on this, and I will  back up that view with a set of examples. Your career is a function of your personal and professional growth and environmental  factors that could either add to or impair your growth prospects. Before we begin,  we need to understand how these environmental factors play out over the short and  long term. Without understanding the power and impact of these forces, you will  not be able to devise a counter-strategy. Structure In this chapter we will discuss the following topics:         Understanding headwinds and tailwinds and their impact on your career    Dealing with headwinds   58      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Drawing a career action plan    Preparing a timeline for change    Understanding the overall challenges        Objectives After studying this unit, you should be able to:    Prepare a plan to deal with headwinds      Learn how to leverage tailwinds to your advantage        Find out how you can entrench yourself in the ET field of your choice 5.1 Understanding winds Let us begin by understanding what exactly are headwinds and tailwinds. Both of  these concepts are part of the environmental factors influencing your career. These  are factors that you don't have any control over and impact your career and growth  in many ways  known and unknown . Headwinds occur when the job market is  weak, there is less demand for various skills, the economy is in recession, and there  are very few opportunities to transition to a suitable role within or outside your  existing company. Headwinds have become quite common these days. Tailwinds, on the other hand, propel your career and place it in on a new growth  trajectory. An example of tailwinds would be a phase when there is a sudden rise  in demand for your skills. This is typically the time when you start getting multiple  calls from recruitment agencies asking if you are looking out. The market is hot, and  companies are ready to loosen their purse strings to bring more people on board,  leading  to  a  massive  spike  in  average  salaries  and  perks.  Sometimes  tailwinds  generate a growth bubble that often bursts in the initial or mid phases of a recession,  leading to a sudden downpour of CVs in the job market. Now many of you would experience a tailwind at some point in your career. It is not  that rare a phenomenon. Way back in 2009-10, when the recession had just commenced,  I landed a job offer from a leading multinational information technology company  for a global project that was just getting launched. I would have been among the  first set of employees to work on that project, which had already excited the analyst  community and shareholders, and there were some excellent reviews from all sides.  The analyst community was already calling the project a gamechanger and talking  about how this company would in the near future capture a good chunk of a new  market segment through this project. However, things soon went into a spin. After three rounds of detailed interviews,  I was not getting my offer letter despite clear verbal instruction coming from the  future boss that I was chosen. Nearly two months passed without any news from    Dealing with Headwinds and Drawing a Career Change Action Plan      59  To do list     Move outside your comfort zone    Be flexible    Expand your options    Upskill    Unlearn    Network    Keep your ears to the ground  them  and  my  patience  was  wearing  thin.  I rang up the hiring manager. She told me  that because of hiring freeze, all new offers  had  to  be  approved  by  the  company's  HQ  in the US, and they were waiting for it. The  process stretched on for nearly six months,  after which I gave up. I wrote a polite email  to them and declined the offer as this wait  was  not  allowing  me  to  focus  on  creating  other  opportunities.  It  was  almost  like  a  Schrodinger job offer. It was existing in two  states simultaneously. It was there while not  being there. I had to take a call. I also got another offer in the meantime and was able to move on in my career. I  sometimes wonder how different things would have been if these headwinds hadn't  crossed my path. The important thing is that I didn't bet all my money on that single move. So even  while I was waiting for the offer letter to come, I was still looking out for opportunities.  When it proved to be an unavoidable distraction, I decided to close the chapter from  my end and conveyed my inability to wait. You cannot afford to have distractions  while you are dealing with headwinds. Keep your mind clear and focused. And yes,  an offer in hand is worth two expected anytime in the mail. Different  people  employ  different  methods  to  deal  with  headwinds.  During  the  same period of recession, a former colleague of mine got a great offer from a near ET  division of a major Indian IT services company. Now, her hiring manager told her  that though they are eager to bring her on board, they didn't have a hiring approval  yet  here we go again . In those days, the approval had to come from the CEO for  this company, and this division had already sought approvals for other roles, so they  weren't sure if the approval would come through. Her hiring manager suggested that  if she were to get an offer from any other vertical and get that headcount approved,  she could then seek a transfer to this division. It was a sneaky scheme but one that  could work. At that time, there was a similar position open in another division, and so she applied  and cleared the interview as well and got the offer. After her induction formalities  were complete, she spoke to her new hiring manager and told her that she was keen  on seeking a transfer to the other division. But her hiring manager was not excited  by the prospect of such a transfer, and she was told in no uncertain terms that such  a transfer could not come through, and if she were coming on board, she had to join  the division that selected her. During ordinary times, such a transfer would have  come through with some resistance, but since those were tough times, there was  indeed no room for this.   60      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     No hiring takes place during a recession – wrong    People don't get promoted during the downturn – wrong    No new projects are taken up during this period – wrong    Most start-ups in ET wind operations during this period – wrong    You can make the most of a recession if you are prepared? Correct  These examples will help you understand the forces at play during headwinds. I did  face tailwinds in my career as well. But that was just once. The disruptive potential  of headwinds is so high that they often negate any gains made during tailwinds. The  global economy has never really recovered from the 2008 recession. So headwinds  are here to stay, and they will influence your career at various times, so it is essential  to learn how to deal with them and make the most of the downturn. Some myths about downturn recessionary periods:           There is always a demand for skilled employees across projects. In the days before  the  2008  recession,  companies  used  to  post  vacancies  across  job  portals.  This  exercise  stopped  during  the  recession,  and  head-hunting  teams  started  focusing  on internal means to hire future employees. This is why a majority of the roles are  never advertised on job portals. For namesake, many companies post these jobs on  LinkedIn, but no one bothers to check the mailbox where the CVs finally land. These  roles are posted on LinkedIn because many of these companies have a corporate  account there, and they get to post roles for free as part of the package they have  bought. 5.2 Dealing with headwinds Headwinds could derail your best-laid plans, so it is better to factor them in your  planning process. You cannot wish them off. The best strategy in this regard is to  understand which aspects of your career could be disrupted most by headwinds.  Take a look at Table 5.1:  Career phase  Getting into an ET role outside your current  organization getting a part during campus  placement or as a fresher   Less than six months of getting a role  Impact  A prolonged search for a role or an opening  that  you  wish  to  apply  to.  Extended  gestation  period  before  the  offer  letter  is  released. Instability in the project due to uncertainty  of  funding  or  availability  of  resources;  lack of hikes or bonuses or other benefits;  internal politics and other such undesirable  factors become more apparent    Dealing with Headwinds and Drawing a Career Change Action Plan      61  Established ET pro looking at moving to a  new role or looking at new projects geo  Looking at starting a new venture  Delays  in  getting  approvals,  projects  going slow and freeze on promotions and  movements  Funding  problems,  to  find  teammates,  lack  of  prospects  for  proof  of  concept projects, and challenges in finding  the right supplies or equipment.   inability   Table 5.1: Impact of headwinds on various career phases                               So as the impact is clear, so should your strategy to deal with headwinds should also  be. These are the steps you can do to be prepared:       Keep your resume ready  polished and updated  at all times, keep updating   it on job portals, and sending it to consultants.         Stay visible in the industry, media, and other channels. Post blogs, write,   speak, or at the very least attend events and network as often as you can. Instead of using social media for fun or other gains, use it to promote your  brand. Write and publish frequently, asking colleagues and friends to chip in  and provide feedback.     Always have a mentor to discuss steps, inspire, and offer guidance, when   called for.     Act as though a recession is around the corner always [it mostly is].     Invest in yourself, attend events, take online courses, take classroom-based  courses, travel as often as you can, read books, and stay focused on what you  need out of your life and career.     Write down your goals in a place where you can see them. If possible, write   it in a piece of paper and keep it in your wallet.     Network to contribute and not just to gain. Share your learnings, be willing   to listen and help others whenever you can.     Volunteer for a good cause. Spend time with people who need your time.  This helps remove unwanted anxieties and replaces them with a feeling of  hope and optimism.     Take a break often. Go on long walks or drives; keep your mind free for   thoughts to come in.     Do not rely on LinkedIn alone to get a job. Use it instead to build your brand   and attract recruiters. Make them come to you.  These are all steps that you can take during or before the headwinds set in. Also,  even during extended periods of recession, there will be breaks that you can use to  get back into the game stronger. But don't wait for these breaks to get things going;  instead, use every opportunity to prepare and grow stronger.   62      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                         How headwinds influence people's behavior         The feeling of injustice in every aspect of professional career increases.    Companies  usually  cut  down  on  perks  and  other  employee  benefits  that   often impact the feel-good factor.     Resistance to change increases, people tends to withdraw into a shell, and   challenges get highlighted while opportunities are getting ignored.     A defensive mindset sets in and people stop spending more on themselves   and others and the things that matter.     Media outlets work overtime to amplify the impacts of the recession focusing   only on the negative aspects.     Headwinds often  bring  in  sweeping  socio-economic changes, and on the  whole, is a period of turmoil and churn, and this makes people restless and  reactive.  The best things to do when facing headwinds:           Get back into the classroom and rehash your skills and get new certificates.    Connect with mentors and take their advice on what to do.    Don't make any sudden moves within your organization. Make every step a   calculated one. Introspect and keep your mind open to new opportunities.        Look and plan. In case your projects have slowed, look for newer activities        to fill up that void.     Read and read more; listen to podcasts and audiobooks as well.    Use this opportunity to bring in more discipline into your life. Look at the  areas where you are not able to do more because of your inability to accord  time. Try and see if anything can be done.     Spend time with family and friends. Do not compromise your family time   for anything.     Take a more in-depth look at your professional career. Are you spending   more time worrying or getting things done?  5.3 Recession survival philosophies Headwinds bring opportunities and challenges. The biggest opportunity is a chance  to reinvent yourself to see if you need to change something within you or in your  environment.  It  teaches  you  to  be  frugal,  lean,  and  focus  on  things  that  matter.  During times of recession, focus on the four S's of evolution which is:       Sensible: Understand the challenges and work towards addressing them   without getting bogged down.   Dealing with Headwinds and Drawing a Career Change Action Plan      63             Sensitive: Everyone is fighting a battle so learn to go easy on people. Also,   be sensitive to your needs as well.     Strategic: Think of doable plans and execution strategies to back them.    Smart: Know which battles to focus your resources on and when to leave the  battlefield when things are not working your way. Smart people know how  to deploy their resources and attention to get the best possible bang for their  buck.  Periods  of  headwinds  teach  us  where  the  money  is.  It's  the  time  to  ‘right-size',  improve efficiencies by cutting down oversized bureaucratic processes that exist  for the sake of slowing things down. Let's stay away from behaviors that promote  recklessness and indulgence and focus on uplifting ourselves and those around us.  Such times present the perfect opportunity to build sustainable organizations and  practices as structured frugality makes more sense during a downturn than during  times of boom. 5.4 Drawing a career change action plan Transitions carry an inherent risk of disruption, so unless you are willing and ready  strategically and tactically to deal with it, periods of transition can derail even the  best-laid plans. If you are transitioning from a non-ET role to an ET one, then it  is a bigger transition. If you are shifting to a new ET, that too will present some  challenges. A core element of any plan is the objective. Once you are clear with that, work out  the timelines and then figure out what to do, when, and how. So now that we have  got all the above elements in place, let us look at drawing up a transition plan. So far  you were working with an enablement plan which focused on getting ready to make  that move now we will see how you are going to make that move. The most critical components of your journey from here on are:                       Your resume    Your certifications    Your perseverance    The books you have read    The people you network with    Your understanding of the industry    Your understanding of where you need to be    The podcasts and audiobooks you have listened to    Your ability to weave everything you have learned into a narrative   64      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Introspection and fine-tuning     Strategic planning    R&D    Marketing and communications  Storytelling     Selling     My understanding is that you have worked on all these areas and are now ready for  the transition. Take an in-depth look at each of the elements mentioned above and  check if you have done your homework in any of these areas. If you haven't, please  spend some time checking all the boxes. So, where do you begin the planning process? Successful start-ups plan along these  lines:           Your career planning should also move ahead in alignment with these steps. The  first step is to determine how you will get into an ET company  again, I am assuming  that you have done everything that I have asked you to do before . Take a deep  breath. There is some good news. ET companies are proliferating faster than ever  before, which also means that there is a need for employees and people who can  bring much-needed skills and strategies on-board. Your  strategic  planning  should  include  tech,  role,  company,  resume  building,  networking, finding opportunities, and evolving a breach strategy. You should be  clear about all these aspects before the planning process even starts as the plan is  nothing but putting the elements in a sequence. You have to improve your research and listening capabilities. This includes your  ability to find things that others miss. Now a good listener who doesn't get drowned  in semantics will be able to locate that morsel of information that they need from the  clutter. Your research should be able to place you in a position where you understand  the patterns of disruption or opportunity. For instance, if you are looking at getting into an ET start-up, your research would  have told you those start-ups hire at all times. Their hiring happens in bursts and is  often linked to funding or the phases they are in. Early-stage start-ups hire less, and  they usually hire through the personal networks of the founders. There have been many instances of customers turning into employees of start-ups as  well. Unlike big corporates where hiring is often dependent on many factors, start- ups have just a couple of factors to consider before posting a job requirement. Let me give you another example. If you had done your research well, you would be  tracking press releases, analyst calls, or even LinkedIn profiles of senior leaders of  a company to figure out when they are going to publish an ad for a particular role.  All these are avenues or early indicators of an imminent hiring phase that could be  around the corner.   Dealing with Headwinds and Drawing a Career Change Action Plan      65  So you have to be connected to the right people and listen to them often to figure  this out. You also need to do some online research and track analysts and others who  can provide you clues on when a company might start recruiting for an ET project. Marketing is another imperative, and while many of us may not get to play many  roles in a company, all of us do become marketers at one point or another. When you  attend an event and introduce yourself by claiming that you belong to a company, you  are spreading awareness, a form of marketing. We even market ourselves through  our CVs and our social media accounts and via interviews and other avenues that  we utilize to move ahead in life. Your plan should take into account ways and means  to market yourself better so that you step into the limelight. An exciting trend seen these days involves people claiming to be storytellers. Now  even a few years ago, storytelling was seen as a way of stretching the truth. I am  glad those days are long gone. Many companies have even appointed corporate  storytellers whose KRA is to package each message into a memorable or relatable  story neatly. A good story inspires, teaches, and makes us store it in the corner of  our memory for future use. Ideally, your career should also have a story that can be  easily narrated and adds a punch to your overall pitch. Become  a  storyteller,  package  your  career  narrative  into  an  interesting  story.  A  good story, in my opinion, must have a thread running across it from beginning  to end that keeps the audience engaged. These days when candidates are asked to  introduce themselves during an interview, they embark on a long discourse ignoring  the patience and attention levels of their audience. Don't be that candidate. Instead,  be someone who makes every aspect of your career journey interest, engaging, and  exciting. Years ago, during my first ET interview, my future manager asked me to talk about  my career thus far. Instead of going on a long soliloquy, I just mentioned an incident  that summarized every bit of my career, including my professionalism, willingness  to learn, my ability to adapt, my motivations, and even my fears. It was a short  snippet I presented. The attention I paid to my interviewer's time worked to my  advantage. Further, I didn't pollute the attention span of my interviewer with any  unwanted details, which again put me in a sweet spot, so to say. Your ability to tell stories without spinning tales will go a long way in determining  your fate as a professional. Everyone likes storytellers, and one may often forget  faces, but the names and the stories stay with us. Selling traditional tech is relatively easy as the market is already ready to buy, and  it just needs a nudge or gentle push. In the world of ET, selling is one of the biggest  challenges out there. In one of my previous roles, there were many opportunities for  me to lead the sales effort along with channel or go to market partners. So when we  used to visit the prospect together and establish a context for sale so that a strong  background for our visit and future interactions is established.   66      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Prevent a burnout    Ensure that you are giving the task s  the right amount of attention    Ensure that you do what is the right thing to do at that moment  In the case of ET, many prospective customers do not even know where an ET fits in  as far as their tech landscape is concerned. So your sales pitch has to include plenty  of research into the business and tech landscape of the company, its pain points, and  figure out a hook that could get the prospective customer interested and willing to  go for a proof of concept project. In the world of IoT, even this is not a guarantee for  sale as the failure rate for IoT PoC projects was as high as 90 percent until recently. So why am I talking to you about selling ET in such detail? Well, in a world where  selling the product itself is tough, it will be equally tough to sell your value proposition  to a prospective employer, especially if you are coming without extensive experience  in the field. Your narrative should be a consistent one, and you should be able to  present it with enough conviction to grab attention and mindshare. 5.5 Preparing the timeline A plan without a timetable is not a plan at all. Pacing your efforts will help you do  two things:       An ideal plan has to be executed in 90 days and start giving you visible signs of  change by at least 180 days, if not earlier. Here is a suggested timeline for your ET  effort:         Mid phase: 30 days      Final phase: 15 days   The initial phase includes figuring out:                       Your dream ET role, company and team    How to manage your current workload as a professional or a student    The certifications you need to do and do it, if possible    Finding a mentor or someone you can bounce ideas off    A plan, ways to implement it and implementing it    How to be active on social media, building a transition profile    Ways to create a visible and robust profile online       Ways to establish a whole new network of people who can help you  Initial phase: 45 days  Job sites that can help   Dealing with Headwinds and Drawing a Career Change Action Plan      67                    The mid-phase involves:       Accelerating all the steps mentioned above. By now you should have got a   grip on these areas and know-how to accelerate  Identify new tasks you can take up to hasten your journey     Start measuring results to see which areas need improvement       Further expanding your network    By this time you should have had multiple rejection emails and at least one   interview     Consolidation and a time-out, if needed to rejuvenate    The final phase is all about cracking the interviews, deciding on an offer, and finally  initiating the transition to ET. If you are a student, most of these steps are relevant  to you as well. But your planning cycle might be a bit different. You need to take  into account steps to leverage a campus recruitment drive or reach out to a potential  recruiter  directly. You  needn't  wait  for  your  final  months  to  do  all  this.  Instead,  you need to be in touch with your dream company mid-way and establish strong  connections and networks of individuals across teams in the company. Challenges The journey won't be a simple one, as I have mentioned before. Just like any other  challenge you may face in your personal or professional life, you will have to conquer  your fears. These fears can be divided into these types:       Fear of change: Many people in the ten plus years of experience category  often shy away from changing their jobs. They have become so comfortable  in their current roles  and the presumed certainty it brings  that they don't  even think about a change. A change can induce unwarranted fears. Samples  include: Will I succeed in the new role? Will I be able to retain or improve my  pay scale? Will it bring the right levels of energy and designation?      Fear of anonymity: You may be a Rockstar in your current role. But post a  leap of faith into ET, you have to begin all over again, and this might prove  to be a barrier that prevents you from thinking freely      Hidden anxieties: Any change brings anxieties that you will learn to deal   with      Transferring the right mindset: A new role gives you a chance to move away  from everything you have done in the past and breach new frontiers. But  there is always a risk of carrying the same mindset on to your new job, and  that is not helpful. Though it is advisable to retain pieces that have helped  you stand out, it is also advisable to move ahead with a new thinking process  that sees every challenge in a new light. This will also open your mind to  new avenues of learning and growth   68      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  The easiest way of dealing with these fears is by talking to someone about it. This  is the best way as well. Talk to a trusted friend or a colleague, family members, or  anyone who can listen to you, even if they are not able to address the fear directly.  You will have to get used to dealing with these fears and anxieties on your own to  the best extent possible without getting stressed. Learn to face your fears. Empower your mind to filter out thoughts that prevent you  from focusing. Remember, there will be naysayers who might make you question  your choice or capability. Learn to minimize their influence on your thinking process.  Be patient and introspective when needed. Lack of patience will give rise to anxieties.  Always remember all significant challenges come with opportunities and vice-versa.  When I got my first ET role, I was asked to change cities, drop everything I had  learned so far, and move into the unknown. There were plenty of anxious moments   some genuine, some imagined . But I was able to make that jump with ease, and  time was on my side as I had imagined. The first few months of change just flew, and  before I knew, I was already a veteran of ET. For those who like to be busy and spend  time learning, these times help in multiple ways. Transition times are suitable for:       Unlearning  things  that  we  longer  need  in  our  personal  and  professional   lives. This helps create space for new learnings to come our way     Focus  on  new  tasks  and  learning  how  to  mold  our  problem-solving      capabilities     Forming new networks for professional growth and learning    More reading      Essential steps that will aid in the planning process:         Find a mentor    Dust that resumes and fixes it so that it starts talking to the people you want   to engage          Write down your short and long term goals    Find out how to learn about jobs that are not published. This is where your  network comes into the picture. Your network should be deeply entrenched  in the company you wish to work for so that you don't miss hearing about  an opening you are interested in  Your  planning  process  should  proceed  with  the  zeal  of  an  intelligence  agency  functionary.  Use  all  ethical  tools  available  to  the  best  possible  extent.  But  then,  always remember that you should never compromise your integrity at professional  and personal levels to attain this role you seek. Keep all actions above board and at  a level where you wouldn't have to remember them with a sense of pain or regret.  Remember these golden rules. They apply across all aspects of your career and life:   Dealing with Headwinds and Drawing a Career Change Action Plan      69              Never be in touch with people solely for your professional gain. Find out  ways to thank those who have helped you. If you cannot repay someone in  kind, pay forward. Help someone else in need as a means of expressing your  gratitude.     Don't ever forget those who have helped you once you have crossed the   bridge.     Never step on someone else's ambitions or sense of being while you are  moving ahead in your career. Now you could be promoted over someone  else,  which  is  fine.  What  doesn't  reflect  well  on  you  is  when  you  start  coaxing, threatening, bullying, or enticing people to do your bidding. We are  all mature enough to understand how it works.  Years ago, I had a colleague who got into ET by sheer accident  there was no planning  involved here . Her boss, who got into a good role in an ET company, pulled her in,  and besides, she was given a good role as well. But instead of being grateful and  humble, this person started rubbing people the wrong way of acting with the grand  illusion that she had arrived in life or so many of us felt.  I was witness to a few  incidents of concern myself, but as she was the chosen one as far as her boss goes,  there was no point in raising these concerns with her or her boss. Her actions were hurting the company, and undoing the results of the work many  of  us  were  doing.  Her  supervisor  went  on  to  defend  her  and  her  actions,  even  admonishing those who brought instances of sheer incompetence to his attention.  Even a single person like this could bring a whole company to its knees. Do not be  that person. The moral of the story is that you don't arrive in life simply because you have got a  good role and are at a good paygrade or have a generous manager. Stay humble and  always be thankful for what has come your way. Till the day you retire quit, you  will be an apprentice at all times. Sometimes you learn from your leaders, sometimes  from your peers and many times from everyone else. Designations don't matter but  your ability to learn does. Conclusion In this chapter, we examined strategies to deal with the recession. In the next chapter,  we  will  study  ways  to  craft  an  ET  friendly  resume.  The  only  way  to  win  is  by  challenging status-quo and by innovating at every step of the journey. Headwinds  and challenges represent an opportunity to learn and apply your mind. Even putting  up a good effort to win teaches you so many things, provided you are willing to  learn.   70      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code Question and answers 1.  Can you tell us more about the specific effects of a recession on one's career    and how to avoid the ill-effects?     Ans. There is a chapter dedicated to this topic towards the end of this book.  2.  Is a recession a wrong time to look for a change or to take on a new role  within your organization?    Ans. No. The timing can only be bad if you are not ready to give your best  to the effort. If you can make a successful move during a recession, you are  definitely in a unique league. Not too many people can do that. But having  said that, you need to be prepared for a few things. Your onboarding won't  be a smooth affair and you may not get enough support while you settle into  your new role.   3.  You have said that I need to be a marketer to be able to sail smoothly in my   career. Can you elaborate on this?    Ans. If you have prepared a resume at some point in your career, you are  already a marketer. What I wanted to emphasize is that we should be ready  to play that role more diligently with some conscious effort going into it.  This includes getting the messaging, target audience, channel, and outcome  mix right.   4.  What can I do to prepare for a downturn?   Ans. Keep your resume ready, build your network, connect with influencers   and many aspects that I have outlined in the previous chapter.                      Building An ET Friendly Resume and Finding the Right Employer      71  Chapter 6 Building An ET  Friendly Resume and  Finding the Right  Employer  Introduction A resume is but a sales document morphing as a statement of intent for a role in  a company. The significance of a resume is reducing as we push forward. This is  thanks  in  part  to  the  emergence  of  video  resumes  and  hackathons.  In  the  post- COVID-19 era, both these avenues will gain more traction in the job market and  this is inevitable. But will the modest resume disappear completely? The answer is  a definite no. A resume presents a wealth of knowledge for recruiters to assess your  skills and it will not be easy to displace it completely. Having said that, the resume is still a great way of presenting a strong pitch and  showcase skills, knowledge, and expertise. But unfortunately, many of us treat it as  another document to be stuffed with every piece of information available, authentic  or otherwise. I have often wondered what makes people misuse a resume so much.   Having set the context, let's now explore ways to avoid some simple mistakes and  work towards building a strong resume. Structure In this chapter we will discuss the following topics:       Understanding the difference between a CV and a resume.   72      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Elements of a resume.    Essentials for building a strong resume    Steps in identifying your next employer        Objectives After studying this unit, you should be able to:    Build a strong industry-ready resume        6.1 Difference between a CV and a resume So, to begin with, we need to understand the fundamental difference between a CV  and a Resume. A lot of people confuse a CV and a resume. These two are different  documents, and both serve a different objective. It is essential to differentiate the two  so that you don't end up sending the wrong document or, worse, putting the wrong  content in the incorrect format.  Identify your next employer  A resume is the first step in your journey  towards a new job. It is the first ally you  have in your battle to prove yourself to a  recruiter. Unfortunately, many of us don’t  treat resumes with the respect they deserve.  Instead, building a resume is often treated  as a chore. In many cases, people are more  mindful while trying their shoelaces than  while  preparing  their  resume.  A  little  attention and dedication go a long way.  the   The  difference  between  two  goes  back  to  their  names.  While  a  CV translates into the course of life in  Latin, a resume means a summary or  an outline in French. The translation  itself  should  tell  you  the  difference,  but to make things more lucid, let me  elaborate. So a CV is more of a career  biography or a document that covers  your  education,  work  experience,  awards,  publications,  honors,  and  other accomplishments.  A CV is a more detailed document and presents a candidate's career in detail. I am  told that a CV doesn't change with each job application. I am not too sure about that  as you will be updating parts of the CV. What if you win a Nobel prize just before  you are about to send your CV? Won't you mention that in the document? Again, the perspectives may vary. But a CV is a more formal and studied method  of applying for a job. A CV is often accompanied by a cover letter that explains why  a candidate is applying for a specific role. In case of positions connected with the  government in some countries and for roles in the United Nations, candidates are  required to write a cover letter as well. A resume is, on the other hand, a concise and precise document. It is usually not  more than a page in length. It is often shared with folks who do not have time to    Building An ET Friendly Resume and Finding the Right Employer      73  examine your career at length. The resume is often tailor-made for a position and  serves  to  make  the  candidate  stand  out  over  the  competition. A  resume  needn't  follow a particular template or chronological order as long as the relevant skills and  competencies get highlighted. A resume is sent with a short note highlighting the role for which the document  is  being  sent  along  with  a  request  for  further  correspondence  and  probably  an  interview:  Factor  Length Content  Accompanied by Order  Change   Keywords  CV Long  2-3 pages  Descriptive goes into details  about  career,  awards,  responsibilities,  academy  memberships, etc. A detailed covering letter  Chronological  Less  prone  updates Used as per need  frequent   to   Primary usage   Common usage  Academia, the public sector,  the United Nations, etc.  UK, Ireland, New Zealand  Resume  Short usually a page long Precise,  targeted role   tailored   to   the   A short note  None Frequently updated   Rich  in  keywords;  SEO  friendly  so  that  it  can  be  easily  located  in  a  digital  heap The private sector, especially  IT and ET companies Rest of the world; In many  countries  like  India,  South  Africa,  and  Australia,  the  terms  CV  and  resume  are  used interchangeably Confused with CV It is commonly used in ET.   Common confusion Use  Confused with resume Only  needed  when  you  are  applying  for  a  senior  position in some verticals   Table 6.1: Difference between a CV and a resume  So now that we are clear about the difference between a CV and a resume, let us  get back to ET. By now, you should have figured out what kind of document would  work when applying for an ET role, haven't you? Yes, most ET roles require you to  furnish a resume with a small covering note highlighting specific aspects of your  resume that might go well with the position you are applying for.   74      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Before we move into the core part of this chapter, I want you also to understand  what a resume is not. It is not a document for:           Boosting your ego    Practicing grammar    Concocting lies and fabrication with the understanding that you will never   be caught. [Remember the former Yahoo CEO?]     Creating a drab narrative of your career assuming the hiring manager will   automatically call you as and when she sees your resume     Showcasing your creativity. Fancy emails, casual photos, Instagram links,   and other similar discretions     Presenting copied content    Blaming someone or your previous employer    Endless exaggeration    Containing job descriptions from all your previous roles          Get the drift? Can your resume speak comprehensively about you  without boring  someone  when you are not around? If yes, you can stop reading from this point. If  your answer is no, read on. Reading a resume is sometimes a bigger challenge than writing one. I had to go  through a few to shortlist a potential candidate for a role in my team. Resume after  resume was written in the same format, had similar content and some of them had  more stuffing than a Winchester sofa. These were all great candidates but thanks to  their resume, I was not able to do come to any conclusion on their skills. Common mistakes or rather crimes connected with resume writing       Stuffing: Adding pages and pages of content just to make the resume appear   more serious Improper formatting Incomplete sentences           Spelling mistakes       Using an industry template    Using hyperbole: If you can convince your recruiter that you are worth it,   Inability to showcase the right skills  then it is fine. Else it is a serious crime                     Common lies found in a resume:         Portraying manager's achievements as your own    Giving the wrong designation   Building An ET Friendly Resume and Finding the Right Employer      75  Inflating skills     Exaggerating responsibilities    Mentioning wrong academic information    Portraying contract employment as a regular one             6.2 Elements of a resume A potential recruiter will look for the answers to these questions in your resume:       Role   The cost of a bad hire  relevance:  Are  you  suited for the job in terms of  tech work experience, relevant  academic  background,  and  to  project  management  techniques  and  [Project  management  experience  will  lend you an edge]  exposure  frameworks?   competence   level:  How competent are you and  what  do  your  achievements  convey?     Your         On  the  other  side  of  the  spectrum,  companies  spend  billions  to  recruit  new  candidates.  This  includes  screening  and  potential assessment processes. According  Bloomberg contributor Cassidy Leventhal,  they  aren’t  getting  much  returns  for  investments.  As  many  as  95%  of  employers admit to hiring the wrong  people  each  year.  Worse,  more  than  a  third  of  employers  report  being  unaware of the true costs of bad hires,  which can reach as high as five times  annual salary costs.     Proactiveness:  Are   you  proactive  and  passionate  enough?  What  kind  of  IT  certifications, peer industry community memberships do you hold?     Academic orientation: Have you published any papers or blogs?      Customer orientation: Can this person be chosen to represent our company?   An essential aspect of a resume must convey is your communication skills. That  is the first thing that comes to a reader's mind when they read your resume. Your  ability to communicate precisely what is required using few words while keeping  the narrative focused on matching your skills and abilities matched to the role you  are applying to is not just a matter of choice but is mandatory. A well-crafted resume  talks to the reader in a conversational tone without sacrificing the intent. The critical elements of a resume are:             Your transferable skills    Achievements in each role along with numbers    Links to your LinkedIn and Twitter accounts to show credibility    Sections on education including recent certifications   76      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  The system is broken, and    no one is fixing it  things  stand   As  today,  nearly  all  recruitment  drives  are  linked  to  an  Application  Tracking  System.  Thus,  a  glorified  algorithm  gets  to  decide  your  fate and unfortunately you have very less  say in that bit. Just imagine your resume  being  deleted  because  it doesn’t have the  right  fonts  or  combination  of  keywords?  For the first time in history, job applicants  are working with what could be a lottery  system for getting hired. An ATS is at its best an eliminator rather  than a tool designed to amplify the chances  of a good candidate. As I have explained  here, there are ways to rig the system and  many people are doing that. So even after  your  resume  makes  it  past  an  ATS,  you  just  get  about  6  seconds  to  engage  the  recruiter.  So,  your  experience,  expertise  and skills are all held hostage to the whims  and shortcomings of human beings and AI  combined.        on      Sections   publications,  patents  filed  or  published  work outside the organization    Aspects  that  highlight  your  leadership  skills  and  your  ability to handle transitions        Technologies you are familiar   with or have worked on    Problem-solving abilities     Header and summary    Contact info and    Body    Signoff    The  resume  should  be  divided  into  the following sections:         The header is a section where you can  highlight  some  key  aspects  of  your  career. Look at this header from an old  resume of a former colleague: Expert  specialist  who  can  conduct  a  vulnerability  assessment  and  penetration  testing  on  networks.  Dedicated  specialist  with  an  advanced  degree in Information Security.  cybersecurity   So, what's wrong with this header? Everything. The keywords aren't aligned with  what a recruiter would be looking for. You need to be very specific when it comes to  wording the header. A potential recruiter just has a few seconds to decide whether  they should continue with your resume or not and being vague doesn't help. You  should be able to clearly articulate the value that you bring to a team and a company.  If this is absent, your resume will be ignored faster than it took for you to read this  paragraph. Do I have a sample for a better header then? Well, I can guide you through the  process. If I show you a better header, the chances are that you will end up using  the same format. Which is will curtail your ability to imagine. I have already told  you what you need in a header – keywords, minimal design, a career summary  that outlines your critical capabilities as a sentence and carries words that a hiring  manager or recruiter could connect with.   Building An ET Friendly Resume and Finding the Right Employer      77  But just so that you get an idea of what a good header should almost look like, here  is another version of the above header: Cybersecurity  analysts  focused  on  conducting  VAPT  on  systems  and  networks.  Proven  proficiency in developing stealth payloads and bypassing strategies to trick infosec teams and  security applications. The header and summary section of your resume should be the most dynamic one.  Ideally, this should be changed with every application. This is also an element that  can help you with the ATS. Now, what is an ATS? ATS is the applicant tracking  system that recruiters use to filter resumes. ATS works on matching keywords and  more the match, stronger are the chances of your resume, making it through this  filter. As much as 75 percent of resumes are rejected by ATS, which makes it a substantial  hurdle for you to beat. In an experiment conducted by Bersin & Associates, a perfect  resume belonging to the most suitable candidate could get only 43 percent relevance  to a role. The AI behind ATS did not recognize a part of the information because of  changing standards and improper formatting. I will get into the details on beating  the ATS in a while, but as far as your header goes, use it to the best extent possible to  fill in the right keywords to frame a coherent sentence. Your resume is your pitch document. It is what an employer will see and engage  with. If the document is framed correctly, you get a chance to bag your dream job. If  not, it will just become a forgotten and unmodified file in someone's machine. Make  sure you put your best foot forward.  Your resume should be aesthetically pleasing with enough whitespaces and packed  with words that a recruiter would want to read. Before you send the resume to  someone, ask yourself. If I were the recipient, would I read this document? Projecting your ET other experience When talking about your experience, focus on outcomes such as:             Money manpower saved    Contribution to revenue    Specific outcomes    Any endorsement you could get from senior management\customer for the      Date of employment    Call out parts of your resume that align with or come close to the job description  mentioned by the prospective employer.

A unique framework devised by her helped  us reduce cyberattacks and move towards adopting key compliance mandates faster” Rob Zalinski Director, Compliance  Ashville Sprockets     6.3 Introducing soft skills As I have mentioned before, you need to project your soft skills to complete your  skillsets. These soft skills must appear on a resume:         Self-starter: Ability to wrest the initiative     Intuitive:  The  ability  to  understand  what  the  situation  calls  for  and  act  accordingly     Logical approach: One step at a time with a laser-sharp focus on objective    Ability to train peers and customer teams    Analytical thinking: The ability to understand the multiple dimensions of   the problem and suggest solutions that work     Communication  expert;  ability  to  communicate  promptly  with  the  right   stakeholders to create the right outcome behavior change            6.4 Adding certifications Before signing up for certifications, make sure you give enough thought to how you  are going to use it. When it comes to certifications, you need to ensure that they:   Building An ET Friendly Resume and Finding the Right Employer      79     Are relevant to the job profile you are applying for    Add weight and not volume to your resume    Are aligned to job market trends and requirements    Are not outdated          Things to remember:                    If  it  must  be  highlighted,  do  it.  Highlight  and  showcase  important  achievements  not contributions  by putting them in a separate box. If possible, showcase your ability to solve complex problems at business and  tech levels in the summary section. Add only important information here.     Never misuse the reader recruiter's attention by adding too many points          Avoid  using  complex  jargon.  Be  clear  and  precise  about  your  value   boxes.  proposition.     Work with an information matrix so that you can modify and move sections   as per the job requirement.  6.5 Building a video resume To begin with, a video resume is not something that everyone needs to build. But it  does impart a certain advantage to the creator. Let me explain. Even today for most  backend jobs, a video resume is not a requirement but for customer-facing roles and  most functional roles, it is good to have one ready. A video resume communicates beyond the limitations of your traditional resume. It  helps personify your resume, showcases your skills and strengths, and even gives  you more avenues for expressing yourself fully. It also:         Helps fine-tune your elevator pitch    Forces  you  develop  your  communication  skills  and  personalization   capabilities  screen behavior        Makes  you  take  concrete  steps  towards  grooming  yourself  and  your  on-         Helps convey your personality    Here are some essentials to remember while crafting your video resume:    It's  your  story:  A  video  resume  gives  you  a  platform  to  tell  a  story  that  resonates  and  if  done  in  the  right  way  could  present  you  as  a  strong  candidate. Weave your strengths, skills, and contextualized work experience  into a strong narrative that conveys all the right messages. Use this as an  opportunity to elaborate on how the role fits into your career path and why    80      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                   it excites you. Convey energy, enthusiasm, and relevance and you will hear  from the recruiter for sure.         Keep it brief: 90 seconds is the limit and as I have said before, this is a slightly  extended elevator pitch so treat it with all due respect. Ideally, you should  be able to wrap it up in about 75 seconds. If you cannot do that then keep  practicing till you get it right. You can work with a script that is fine-tuned  after each session. Avoid unnecessary content and or the urge to glorify  your achievements. This is not a casting video for a Hollywood production  so resist the urge to go overboard. It  should  be  professional  in  all  aspects:  Avoid  fancy  backgrounds,  background music, and the video should be short in an environment that  keeps the focus on you. Any distraction could cost you more than you can  imagine. Invest in the right equipment: All good phones come with good cameras  these days, so you don't have to slog your energies off finding one. Instead,  invest in a tripod stand that can stabilize the phone and hold it properly.  This makes a huge difference to your video and is mandatory.     Customize: There is no way that you can send the same video to multiple  companies across job roles. So, don't even try that. Keep your video relevant  to the role you are applying for and address the recruiter directly if possible.      Some dos and don'ts  Do:             Make sure that the recruiter accepts video resumes    Ensure there is ample lighting so that your face and hands are seen    Wear formal attire or at the best business casuals    Keep your eyes focused on the camera. Never fidget or look nervous. Appear      Keep the camera lens clean and ensure that your audio is up to the mark    Captions  can  be  added  in  case  you  feel  that  your  accent  could  impede   natural and calm  comprehension  Don't:             Buy or rent a huge set up including studio, camera, costly audio equipment    Shoot in a distracting location    Shoot in a noisy environment    Share the video without watching it yourself   Building An ET Friendly Resume and Finding the Right Employer      81  6.6 Identifying the right employer and  team Getting  an  ET  role  in  a  big  corporation  and  moving  laterally  to  a  new  tech  are  both tough propositions. Bigger companies often go after candidates with tons of  experience and those from top-tier B-school or colleges. Treat that as a blessing. With  the number of start-ups rising by the hour, these are great times to be in. Covid-19  has opened up new niches to explore and technologies such as IoT have already  started gaining more traction than ever with the number of new use cases rising. Not only are some challenging roles available today, but you also get to work with  some great minds who are creative in thinking, innovative in action, and who can  teach you a lot by just being around. Pandemics, social unrest, wars, and natural  disasters are here to stay and intensify. Thus, the need for problem solvers who can  harness tech to create new foundations for the development of unique and innovative  solutions is now more than ever. The year 2009 will be remembered, among other things, for the Netflix cultural memo  that came out that year. Penned or rather conceptualized and floated by Netflix's  chief talent officer Patty McCord. It outlines ways in which technology companies  should view people. Though the memo has since become a bit dated, core concepts  such  as  freedom  and  responsibility,  radical  levels  of  candor  and  openness  have  lingered on the horizon. The memo sought to take a huge detour from traditional team-building tactics that  relied on operating as a family. Instead, the document asked Netflix employees to  work as sports teams by setting very high expectations while operating in a highly  competitive environment. This is what it said: We're a team, not a family. We're like a pro sports team, not a kid's recreational team.  Coaches' job at every level of Netflix [is] to hire, develop, and cut smartly, so we have stars  in every position. Many start-ups have since internalized the core agenda of this memo. I was part of  a company that was quite enamored by this memo and its approach and I was part  of many town hall meetings where we used to hear sermons about operating as a  sports team. Many  companies  missed  the  core  idea  of  this  memo  which  is  to  create  strong  interpersonal bonds that support a joint march towards a common goal. This is why  many of them fumbled in implementing the memo. By not identifying the core idea  of the memo, these organizations were not able to generate a conducive environment  for deploying its recommendations. They didn't understand it in the first place.   82      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  While the memo says: We don't measure people by how many evenings or weekends they are in their cube. We  do try to measure people by how much, how quickly, and how well they get work done –  especially under deadline. Many start-ups agreed to the second part of the above statement while bypassing  the first one. Thereby the memo was selectively implemented which meant that  employees were measured by the time spent in their cubicles and how well they  got the work done. Concept alien to the work culture in some countries were also  ignored out of convenience. Some big corporations are still struggling to understand  why the memo was created in the first place. In the ET domain, companies will be working with more and more precise data in  the future. Therefore, the work culture will evolve from primitive to contemporary  while heading to futuristic:  Figure 6.1: Differences in work culture  Business objectives and big data will drive this transformation. With emphasis and  reliance on accurate data increasing, projects will be treated with the same level of  diligence and focus as that of the launch of a spacecraft. Yes and this change will  happen in the next 5-7 years. Signs are already there and it is just a matter for when  rather than if. 6.7 Big corporations, bigger bureaucracies If you have ever worked for a big brand, you will already know what it is like. For  something as small as adding a feature to a product takes months, and everything  has to go through a process with approvals at various levels. Some time ago, I was  part of a team that was a separate line of business within a large organization. We  had a few dependencies on the larger organization as far as shared services were  concerned. So while things used to move at a hectic pace within my team, it used to  slow down the moment our parent organization was involved. Now don't get me wrong; some people do manage to thrive in such an environment.  I am not one of them. There should always be room and support for innovation in  all organizations, but in larger corporations, this is often not the case. Such instances  are treated as deviations and cause much consternation. In small organizations and    Building An ET Friendly Resume and Finding the Right Employer      83  start-ups, it is tough to hide behind teams and red-tape. Despite this, I have seen  leaders who were less proactive in bigger corporations than in smaller businesses. There was this conversation that I stumbled upon on Twitter the other day, where  someone working for a large corporation had posted on how it was like working for  a large corporation. Now, this is a company that takes pride in fostering a culture  of innovation. This person, a former employee of this company, openly admitted  that he didn't have much to do in this company. Since he had come from a start-up  and was always excited by work, the sudden lack of an opportunity to do anything  productive created a huge vacuum in his life. These may be isolated cases and not the norm. In my long association with start-ups  and small companies, I don't remember a dull day. 6.8 Hiring is an uphill task for start-ups Yes, you have heard it right. Start-ups often struggle to hire good people. Start- ups  never  attend  campus  placements,  and  in  cities  like  Santa  Clara,  Bengaluru,  Amsterdam, Seattle, and New York, large companies attract the best talent available.  This makes start-ups try extra hard to bring in good people, which is also why they  are not often looking for folks from big B schools. They need people who are problem  solvers, go-getters, and who can get the job done. 6.9 Few reasons why an ET career in a   start-up should appeal to you       Opportunity to wear multiple hats: In one of my previous roles, I was a  product manager, business analyst, project manager, partner manager, and  more all in a single day. I used to open my mailbox and start my day in one  role and end my day in another. My day used to start with Singapore or  sometimes Japan and end with San Francisco or even Chile. For those who  crave for learning and more action, what could better. If you are a quick  learner and able to deploy your learnings quickly, you will thrive, and if you  live challenges, the job satisfaction that you get from such roles is almost  intoxicating.     Working with leadership: In ET start-ups, the leaders often work harder  than people at other levels. I know of a Line of Business CEO who is a jet  setter, travels 20 days a month, across cities meets prospects customers, gives  demos, presentations, readouts, and still turns up at a 7 am meeting without  a hint of tiredness. This CEO even does coding when there is a need to.  Compare that with the delegation process that you often see in established  organizations.      84      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                 In ET start-ups, you get to work with such people and become these people.  They are mentors, coaches, and their passion for work is contagious, and  even there is no vaccination to prevent you from getting inspired to work  like them.     Rewards: You may be rewarded more in a large organization in material  terms. But when it comes to job satisfaction and even other perks like ESOPs  and stakes, start-ups can give you way more than the competition.     Culture: This could cut both ways. In established corporations, because of  the inherent hierarchy and matrix structures  which are often redundant , the  not so competent get to hide themselves and their work well. All one needs  to do is to make five hops, spend about 7-10 years hiding behind teams, and  then once they get into a leadership position by hook or crook, they establish  themselves well. They are given huge teams and cabins and rule the roost by  making others work while they pretend to be leaders. In start-ups, you cannot do such things. From day one, you know that you  either float together or sink together. Many people seek out such jobs purely  driven by passion and the need to make a difference. This is why people  are often so busy that they often don't have time for gossiping, scheming  to pull someone down, backbiting, and the other bad traits that have come  to symbolize a corporate career. There might be exceptions on both sides,  but I would instead take my chances with start-ups rather than established  entities.     6.10 Parameters to help you chose your  next employer and team Choosing a new employer is often a matter of anxiety for many of us. Not only  does it involves leaving behind a comfort zone but also walking into a zone of the  unknown. It is therefore important to do your diligence before you move into a new  role in a new company. Here are a few things you can do before you make the switch. 6.10.1 Cafeteria conversations When you are given a chance to evaluate a start-up, make sure that you dine with  the team in their cafeteria. While doing that, pay special attention to the nature  of  conversations  happening  around  you.  In  many  of  the  start-ups  and  smaller  companies I have been privileged to work with, cafeteria and group conversations  were often focused on discussing markets, trends, tech, start-ups, puzzles, books, or  sci-fi movies. It is always an immense delight to discuss and learn things from your  teammates or others in such an informal setting.   Building An ET Friendly Resume and Finding the Right Employer      85  Such  knowledge-sharing  kept  us  primed  for  a  critical  customer prospect  conversations. For those of us in sales and marketing, this is akin to combat training  for the armed forces. A conversation is too precious a commodity to waste. You  are investing your mind, time, and attention in it. Despite this, many people use  conversations to indulge in gossip or self-pity. Both are harmful to your personal  and professional growth. Now people do discuss work and their personal lives as well. But if you see too  many negative conversations happening around you  by that I mean conversations  that you wouldn't want to be part of , then it's time for a rethink. Such discussions  can go a long way in indicating the nature of interactions you will be having with  your teammates and colleagues in the future. Make sure you talk individually to as many of your teammates as possible. You  will get critical insights into aspects such as team structure, work culture, bonding,  and more. All these parameters will decide your tenure and work satisfaction in the  organization. 6.10.2 Business model s  Start-ups and businesses that deploy innovative business models that exploit market  conditions to their advantage in an on-going manner are the ones that thrive in the  long run. Innovation is not just about bringing an innovative product or service to  the market. It is also about how you market and sell the offering as well. If the entity's offering fulfills a market need, then it has made a good start. Some  companies are bringing out offerings purely for upping their valuation. 553 start- ups with funding of as much as $1.9 bn failed in 2019. When one equates this to new  Lines of Business that have failed or are growing at a snail's pace, the numbers may  be even higher. Here is some more bad news. According to Harvard, almost 90 percent of tech- centric start-ups fail. To help you ponder, here are some reasons why start-ups fail.             6.10.3 Background of teammates and others As I have said before, in one of my previous roles, I was part of a start-up where  the entire leadership and many employees at various levels came from the same      The product or offering is ahead of its time.    Problems with lead investors investor pressure or even impatience         Litigation     Short of money     Unknown  yes sometimes the reasons are not disclosed   Issues with employees and operational costs   86      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                       company. Unfortunately, the company was an IT services company that never had  a product culture, to begin with. Over 70 percent of people had come from this  company, and they brought the culture and way of working from their old company  with them.  Our start-up soon turned into a miniature version of the company these folks had  come from, and the attrition rates for newcomers from other places hit almost 90  percent in less than a year. On the brighter side, this led to some hilarious Glassdoor  reviews.  Do thorough diligence on the background of your future teammates. Clear red flags  are these:       Most have come from the same company or have worked together extensively      A significant number of team members have not done any certifications or      Most team members are focused on being workaholics without focusing on   in the past  courses after joining  working smart     Most act and think alike    No one blogs or posts interesting content on social media    Most folks are subject matter experts only when it comes to their product or   offering but lack a deeper understanding of the tech and market s      The presentation decks are too focused on the offering and lack information   on trends relevant to a prospect     The presentation decks are more than 13 slides on an average    The team is arranged around one person who gets to have the final say on   everything based on his or her mood  Finally, ask yourself. Can this team defend your offering in a shark tank environment?  Yes, your diligence on the company should be that deep, wide, and specific as well  when it comes to grading them. 6.10.4 Future roles See the leadership structure of the organization and figure out how your role will  evolve in the future. You can also check other positions in the same firm to see if you  can apply for another role in the future as part of your career roadmap. 6.10.5 Team dynamics When  it  comes  to  the  team,  make  sure  that  you  are  engaged  with  like-minded  people. Many of the VCs I have spoken to have told me about the lengths to which    Building An ET Friendly Resume and Finding the Right Employer      87  they go to examine the leadership team of start-ups they are planning to invest in.  There was the case of a VC who sent her relative to work on one of the start-ups she  was evaluating. Just like VCs do their homework as far as the leadership is concerned, you need to  do your diligence on the team you are going to work with. Are these people like- minded  and  driven  by  passion?  How  knowledgeable  are  they?  What  motivates  them? How aligned are they to the company's vision and mission? What kind of  knowledge do they share with the rest of the world  which out their blog posts and  social media accounts ? The energy levels, the decor, the cubicle designs, and any  aspect that strikes you. Check all these aspects and make sure that you don't lose out  on any detail. Study the company's business model careful and ask these questions:               How soon can they break even?    What is their plan B for revenue?       Have they kept their operating expenses low?    How does their balance sheet look like  if they are willing to show you this   If I was an investor, will I invest in this company?  post a Non-Disclosure Agreement ?          Do their customers need the product or offering?     Is  their  go-to-market  strategy  viable?  For  instance,  start-ups  and  even  established businesses need to have fewer feet on the ground. They can use  partners instead.     How strong is the competition?    What is the offering roadmap, and how strong is it?      6.10.6 Offerings Do the offerings of the company excite you? Are they something you would love to  develop, sell, or recommend? Would you buy this product if it were offered to you?  These are questions you need to answer. Your diligence on the company should  necessarily take into account the offerings of the company as these are often the  indicators of the company's ability to innovate and survive and thrive during tough  times. If possible, attend a trade event they are attending or listen to a podcast or videos of  their people presenting their product to the world. Study the pitch carefully and see  how evolved, mature, and fine-tuned it is. Are the folks talking about the right value  proposition? How easy or hard is it to sell these offerings? Make  sure  you  consult  others.  Speak  to  ex-employees  and  do  other  kinds  of  diligence. Never make that leap till you are sure to the extent that data permits.    88      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Always remember that before you sign on the dotted line, you will only hear good  things from people in the org. But it is after you join that you often get to see the true  picture, so it is up to you to ensure that the picture before matches the picture after  and that there is nothing to be disappointed about. Things may not work as well as planned, but even if you find good reasons to stay  after a while, you can say that you have succeeded. Remember, your career is not an infinite one. You only have limited time to do what  you love, so don't spend it on things that are a drag or working with people you don't  relate to. Make sure that you make the right choices as far as teams and teammates  are concerned so that you get a productive environment to think and do things that  are aligned to your potential. Conclusion Choose your team based on:         Opportunities to learn and grow    Team attributes – excitement and energy levels, passion for the team and   company, quality of casual conversations     Offering-market fit    Organizational culture    Funding history    Analyst ranking  not too important     What former employees have to say    Quality of content published by the company    Their sales pitch    Product roadmap                  Secret  tip:  Vendors  are  a  huge  repository  of  information  and  can  provide  great  insights during your diligence phase. Talk to them to see how often they clear their  bills and how the vendors are treated as well. They can tell you about the financial  health of the company better than anyone else. You shouldn't join any company that  doesn't treat its vendors well. This is a non-negotiable parameter. Questions and answers 1.        Ans.

When used in the right manner, it can be a force multiplier for your career  but when it is misused, it can do irreparable harm.  The rise of LinkedIn, Twitter,  and  Medium  has  eclipsed  all  other  developments  in  the  recruitment  space.  In  addition to presenting remarkable insights into a candidate's thinking, personal and  professional priorities, it also gives recruiters a huge clue on whether she would fit  into the cultural and social matrix of a team she is being considered for. Social media is also a vehicle for deception and various reasons; it also attracts the  worst in us human beings. Most people think that LinkedIn is the only avenue for  them to showcase their professional attributes and they can be free to be who they  are on other social media channels. Such are the types of myths that exist out there.  Little wonder that many of us are unable to make the most out of this wonderful  medium. Structure In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:         Understanding how social media works from a career perspective    Strengths of various social channels and how to leverage them   92      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Social media dos and don'ts    The hidden social channel that we fail to harness     Learn how to use social media to your professional advantage    Understand what works on social media and what doesn't    Learn how to make yourself more discoverable on social media channels      Objectives After studying this unit, you should be able to:       Social media is an old yet powerful medium for improving your chances of getting  an ET job. According to a Webber Shandwick survey last year  2019 , as many as 98  percent of all employees use at least one social media site app for their personal use.  Many of whom use it to post about their company as well. In a world wherein some  cases, it takes as much as 50-60 percent of an employee's salary to find a replacement  for her after she quits, the power of social media as a recruitment tool cannot be  ignored anymore. Social media presents a win-win situation for employers and employees. Employers  can  verify  and  hire  candidates  directly  while  employees  can  connect  with  more  opportunities than what they would have otherwise come across. So be prepared  to use social media channels to the maximum to further your voice in the industry,  build an incredible personal brand, and get hired. 7.1 Getting the basics right So, where do you begin? Your content will play a key role in your efforts on social  media. A good place to start would be by identifying what others are posting on  social media and then figuring out a gap that you can cover. This should be linked  to the technology you are aiming to get into. For instance, if many folks are talking  about using blockchains in financial services, see if you can talk about use cases  involving the use of blockchains in disaster management  for sake of an example ?  Yes, you will have to be imaginative and able to think through ideas to post and  share. As in every other aspect of your life, differentiation will take you places on social  media as well. If your content is different, engaging, and timed well, you could raise  to stardom sooner than you can imagine. Getting  hired  on  social  media  is  all  about  perseverance  and  innovation.  By  understanding what your followers are looking for and meeting those needs, you  will be placed on a pedestal. This will increase your influence and reach, and you  will be able to appear on the radar of a potential recruiter.   Getting Hired Through Social Media      93                    There should be a word of caution here, however. Many brands and even people  have burnt their fingers trying to tame this beast. The trick is not to tame it but to  work with it to achieve your goals while helping individuals and companies thrive.  Collaboration, and not control, is the keyword. Be discoverable and stay discoverable. Let your dream job find you. 7.1.1 LinkedIn I have given some information on getting hired via LinkedIn in previous chapters.  In this chapter, we will do a deep dive and unearth some secrets to building an  irresistible profile on this vital social channel. Let us begin by asking ourselves a few  questions and logging the scores mentioned against each question:       How many visits does my LinkedIn profile get in a month? <Less than 300   visits, 3 points. More than 300, 6 points>     How many recruiters have reached out to me in the last 90 days? <None, 0      How many connection requests do I get every week? <Less than 20, 3 points,   points. More than 2, 3 points.>  more than 20, 6 points>      How often do I update my social media profiles? <Once a day 6 points, Once      Have I used my social media for sharing something funny? <Yes 0 points; No      Can I get hired through social media? <If you feel you can give yourself 3   a week 3>  1 point>  points; else 0>     Do I often share interesting, recent, and posts relevant to my network using  my social media accounts? I am not referring to anything political or related  to entertainment here.    If you have scored 9 or less in this exercise, you need to do a lot more to get hired.  Read on.  Let's get a few myths busted before we get into the core aspects of this topic:       Social  media  is  not  a  platform  designed  with  just  one  or  two  objectives  in  mind.  It  helps  people  connect  with  like-minded  professionals,  share  updates, seek jobs, expand their influence, discover good content, sell ideas  and solutions, and more. If you are a professional and are someone focused on your career growth, it is  advisable to avoid posting content with political undertones. Inflammatory  content is to be avoided altogether.      Your LinkedIn profile is not a place to boast and post half-truths. Which is             why we recommend endorsements?   94      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code         It is not the place to discuss your problems. It, not a venue to send unlimited and unsolicited invitations.           Sharing jokes on LinkedIn is akin to stating that you are not interested in   taking your career seriously.  Despite  knowing  all  this,  candidates  continue  to  commit  professional  hara-kiri  on LinkedIn. I have seen jokes, posts related to gossip, conspiracy theories, and  everything unprofessional on LinkedIn. Why do people do such things? Does the  ability to think rationally evaporate when it meets a powerful social platform?  7.1.2 What are recruiters looking for? Before a recruiter even reaches out to you for a conversation, someone from their end  would have done a complete check on your social accounts. This includes LinkedIn,  Twitter, Facebook, Medium, and even YouTube and other social media sites that are  on the web. So what are they searching for? The number one attribute is professional conduct and presence. This is where the  search starts. One of my former colleagues, who works in the HR team of a large  company based in the Middle-East, tells me that this is done even before a call is  made or an email sent to the candidate. Any hint of unprofessional behavior will  lead to immediate disqualification, and this could harm your chances if you are  looking to work for an ET firm for the first time. The  second  important  factor  is  integrity.  They  will  compare  your  resume  with  what you have mentioned in your social profile and check for discrepancies. Small  discrepancies will be flagged, and large ones will lead to a deletion of your resume.  Your educational qualifications, publications, and your posts will also be of interest  to them.  If your LinkedIn profile, for instance, is highly 'shareable,' and you have paid a lot  of attention to detail, the chances are that you are a diligent and presentable person  in real life too  though this is not entirely necessary as sometimes people employ  specialized firms to fine-tune their profiles for them . In today's times, it is essential to  hire people who can be presented to customers, media, analysts, and even potential  employees. Even customers look at the LinkedIn profile of people they are engaging  with, so the stakes are high for you and your company.  Here are some points to focus on in your drive to engage recruiters: Proof of concept is necessary: no matter where you come from or which job you are  planning to target, it is crucial to prove that you have delivered in areas connected to  it. Suppose you are coming from a background involving a different technology, what  can you do? As I have said before, after you get certifications, try and get involved in  live projects. Work on these projects through a mentor or by volunteering your skills.    Getting Hired Through Social Media      95                 Try and get some results that you can feature on your resume. This should, if possible,  include numbers. At a bare minimum, it should have some areas where you have  provided tangible output. Examples from the ET world are given here:       Provided business requirement inputs for an IoT project in the Industrial IOT  segment. Inputs covered including stakeholder analysis, business analysis  plan, current state analysis, prototyping and helped get a sign-off from the  customer in under five days.     Helped improve the pipeline velocity for five key opportunities by 13 percent   through an opportunity plan. Improved campaign lead conversion by 14 percent by altering the messaging  dynamics at the a b testing phase itself.      These are raw examples; they need to work in terms of adding more aspects to  strengthen the case for your eventual recruitment. Focus on tangibles and never  make the mistake of copying and then pasting your job description in your LinkedIn  profile. Your LinkedIn profile is your professional window to the digital world, and  it  should  be  several  notches  higher  than  your  résumé  when  it  comes  to  pulling  connections and attracting recruiters.  Focus on the following points:       Profile  title:  No  need  to  put  vague  and  long  titles  that  don't  add  up  to   anything.     Sample:  Digital  transformation  expert  who  helps  companies  sell  better.  What was that? Also, your profile title should never be your default job title.  Shows a lack of creativity and an incentive to hire. Highlight the different  hats you wear. Give people a reason to click on your profile and read.     LinkedIn summary: This is often the hardest part of many because it is about  talking about yourself and your value proposition for a company. Start with  a few lines and then build on it as you move along. Make sure you have a  coherent narrative along with an elevator pitch. Talk about your work and  what excites you.      ET profile: Needless to say, if you are looking for an IoT role, that keyword  should come at the right places to make your profile more discoverable and  search-friendly.   7.1.3 Publish often There is a reason why LinkedIn allows you to publish content. It is not just to amplify  your professional credentials but also to give your profile depth, width and to make  your profile stand out among the heap. How many of us post on LinkedIn often?  I am not referring to people posting random content that has nothing to with their  profile. I am instead talking about those who publish with a plan and content that  resonates with their profile.   96      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Posting good and original content created by you helps you in these ways:         Takes your profile places as people may start sharing your article or post    Adds  the  right  keywords  to  your  profile  making  your  profile  more   discoverable     Gives your profile an extra surface area on the LinkedIn domain    A space-tech start-up approached me nearly two years ago. The recruiter stumbled  on my profile through an article that I had published on space research almost a  year ago. When I started talking to my hiring manager, we already had a good  conversation point. He began by asking me a few questions about that article. He  was quite excited by the fact that I had maintained a very high level of interest in  space-tech even though it was not my primary domain of employment. The opportunity didn't come through as I was considered too old for the role that  was offered. That was one of the first instances of ageism that I encountered. Imagine  being cleared by the hiring manager and then getting stuck at the HR level? Yes, I  couldn't clear the HR round because I was considered old for the role. I am still in touch with the hiring manager, and the whole process of knowing that  something I had been doing something out of sheer interest could help me get an  interview was encouraging. That article is one of the reasons why I am writing this  piece. When a single article could do so much, imagine what a series of articles can  do? LinkedIn is thus a great place to showcase your intent and your ability to learn,  comprehend, and communicate information with the greatest of ease. This is why it  is such an in-demand platform among recruiters and hiring managers. Your LinkedIn  profile can speak more about you than any resume or even references and accolades.  It also starts talking before your résumé even enters the room. When done well, it  eclipses your résumé by light years in terms of utility and getting you the right job.  7.1.4 Keep it clear and precise Most profiles on LinkedIn are either too descriptive or too light on words. Make sure  you keep the lines short but descriptive enough to communicate. You get the drift,  right? Ensure that the right keywords are all spread across your profile. A word of  caution here. Do not write for the sake of keywords. That's cheating in my books and  hopefully in yours too. We must work with the system and not against it. Be creative, but don't get carried away. You should be a good storyteller, but doesn't  waste post merely trying to compete with established influencers. Be inspired by  them, but don't compete with them. If you are good enough, your content will create  a niche for you.   Getting Hired Through Social Media      97  Once you save, locate your profile through a search online and see what someone  will feel like after reading your profile. You can also convert your profile into a PDF  and read it to ensure that it is engaging and error-free. Remember that even a single  simple error can lower your professional standing almost immediately. Don't give  anyone an excuse to ignore your profile. 7.1.5 Use scanning tools Profile scanning tools, such as the one offered by Jobscan can help you in fine-tuning  your  profile.  The  best  method  of  fine-tuning  is  by  continually  modifying  it  and  seeing whether your profile is getting enough hits or not. While you are at it, use the  inputs you get from profile scanning tools to optimize your profile further. A  word  of  caution  here:  Do  not  implement  every  input  you  receive  from  these  scanning  tools  without  diligence.  Remember  that  these  tools  do  not  have  the  wherewithal to accommodate regional nuances and strategies adopted by recruiters  for hiring. 7.1.6 What not do on LinkedIn? This is something that I cannot stop emphasizing on. LinkedIn is a professional  platform and one that is designed to help professionals interact and engage. It is  not another Facebook. Many people forget this golden rule so let me repeat them  for you:       Do not treat LinkedIn as a platform for expressing your political views, no  matter how much you feel about it. On a personal level, I am allergic to seeing  politics on social media. On a channel like Twitter, there is nothing much you  can do as it has been completely hijacked by political conversations leaving  less  room  for  everything  else.  But  then  again,  you  needn't  fret.  You  can  always choose to follow people who share the content of value on Twitter.  More on Twitter in a while.     Now  back  to  LinkedIn.  Expressing  political  views  on  LinkedIn  is  not  recommended. Neither is sharing content that is funny, religious, derogatory,  offensive,  or  designed  to  hurt  someone's  feelings  at  an  individual  or  community level.     LinkedIn is not a dating platform. You know that.    Never use LinkedIn to take potshots at someone.    Do not spam everyone else's timeline with posts.    Never post for the sake of posting; post instead to add value               98      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                Here are a few things that should be on your to-do list:       Be clear about the type of content you wish to share on LinkedIn and stay   focused on that. This will help prevent spamming.     Be respectful to everyone and thank people who engage with your posts.    Be mindful at all times. Remember, someone somewhere will see what you  have posted or done on LinkedIn. So make sure that you post things that  help you in your career.     Talking about your volunteering activities is fine. But your profile shouldn't      Thanking  your  mentors  and  coaches  and  colleagues  is  a  recommended   be only about that.  activity.     For bagging an ET specific role, post on topics related to that tech and that's   what will help you along.  Never make the mistake of applying for a job on LinkedIn. The platform is quite raw  and unorganized when it comes to handling resumes and getting people who apply  hired. I know many folks who have applied as many as 1000 times across different  relevant posts without any success. Years ago, I decided to give LinkedIn a try. I never applied in bulk or blindly. My  target used to be to apply for two jobs a week. Each position was studied, and I used  to tweak my resume, prepare a neatly drafted cover letter usually addressed to the  hiring manager or the recruiter. It didn't help much. In my entire career, I must have  given about seven interviews for positions where I applied via LinkedIn. There were a couple of instances where the hiring manager used to conduct a 'mock'  interview without any intention of hiring me  one of them even admitted as such .   The bottom line is that it didn't add up to anything worth talking about. I wouldn't  discourage you from applying via this channel. But I will certainly ask you to accord  this a very low priority in the overall scheme of things. Let them find you. That's the mantra here. In every social media platform, you will have access to analytics. Make sure you use  them to the fullest. These analytical tools give you insights that can help you tweak  your content and overall approach to social media. It is essential to pay attention to  the numbers and use them appropriately. Examples of insights:              Profile visits    Profile visits linked to specific posts  Interactions with posts   Getting Hired Through Social Media      99            Twitter  gives  you  fascinating  insights  into  the  nature  of  your  followers,   including information such as income, companies, interests, etc. Increase or decrease in follower count    All these are essential and relevant data points. Keep track of them daily to ensure  that you are doing the right things. You have also heard about how specific sites have an ideal time of posting. It is  advisable to use those windows to build traction. If you are targeting geography  outside India, your posts must show up at those times in that geography or country.  You will be surprised to know how many folks ignore this basic rule. 7.2 What to do on Twitter? Now that we are almost done with LinkedIn, let us focus on Twitter. Since LinkedIn  has been accepted as a professional platform, Twitter gets used by most folks to  express thoughts that they wouldn't be able to on LinkedIn. Here are a few facts  about Twitter:             Many tech start-ups use Twitter for hiring    Twitter acts as a force multiplier for your LinkedIn profile    Twitter gives you direct access to decision-makers at the highest levels    ET job seekers who maintain a good profile on Twitter that helps showcase  their expertise and experience often end up getting noticed by leaders who  may want to hire them     Twitter can also be a traffic source for your LinkedIn profile or website or      blog or places that you want others to visit          You can get access to hidden jobs on Twitter. This is especially true of ET.    Twitter helps you sharpen your communication skills – to say more with   fewer words without running the risk of being misunderstood  Twitter is a great place to initiate conversations to attract attention using quality  content. It also gives you access to recruiters, placement agencies, speaking or writing  opportunities, and more. It is also a great place to showcase your elevator pitch. You  don't always have to have original content to post. I am not recommending a plain  copy and paste here from someone else, but you can also retweet a tweet by giving  attribution or publish stuff you have got from some other site again by attributing  it to the source. What to post on Twitter?           News snippets       Quotes  Infographics   100      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Links to your blog posts     Information that may be of interest to your followers and connections      It  is  a  very  underrated  platform  when  it  comes  to  job  search  or  professional  development, which is why you see the whole world is active on LinkedIn. At the  same time, a smaller segment of that lot is doing something significant on Twitter.  Within that segment also, many folks use Twitter to express their political opinion or  opinion that they won't post on LinkedIn. Your Twitter account is not an island. It cannot exist in isolation from your LinkedIn  profile. If a recruiter or a hiring manager sees a dichotomy between the two, it is  clear that you are presenting a muted or a more presentable version of yourself on  LinkedIn for various reasons, and this can be a big turnoff. Your resume and all  social accounts need to be in sync with each other. There can be subtle differences  though overall, it is essential to maintain consistency, and it adds to your professional  standing. When  I  started  on  Twitter,  I  barely  had  about  ten  followers.  I  even  ignored  the  platform for almost five years. After some time, when I was actively looking for an  ET role, I got active again, and within just a year, I got 2000 followers. Now it may be  low by Twitter standards, I didn't buy followers, nor did I run any campaign or any  promotion drive to gain followers. All I did instead was chose two tracks IoT and Start-ups and started tweeting unique  content on them. I purged my handle of old tweets that had nothing to do with these  two topics and started tweeting actively. I maintained a timeline in my mind, which  I adhered to religiously. I used to tweet twice a day, once when I reached office in the  morning and before going to bed. Here are some of the other tactics that I followed:           Tweeted information that was less than an hour old; IE, latest content.       Overall most of my content is always very visual  or at least has a visual   I posted infographics often.  element .           The content was particular to the topic, and there were no breaks, and this   was done with the highest levels of discipline and dedication. I used to check the analytics numbers every day at noon to figure out the  content for the next day.           Course corrections were done daily.      Content that didn't receive any likes or retweets was deleted within 24 hours. I followed this routine religiously for three years. Things got a bit slow after that as  my attention got diluted, and I had to focus on a few other things on my plate. My  traction on Twitter started experiencing a downturn after that. The lesson is clear to  keep posting and keep interacting with your followers and others.   Getting Hired Through Social Media      101  How did Twitter help me in my job hunt? Well, for one, when I was in the middle  of the interview that got me my first ET job, my hiring manager asked me to share  all my social media account links. She checked all of them in this order: LinkedIn  followed by SlideShare and Twitter. She did check my Twitter account along with the others. She revealed this when I  got a chance to meet her later after my onboarding. She also said that she wanted  me to continue my social media work after I joined with the same enthusiasm and  efficiency. I was more than happy to oblige. Twitter has of late turned into a battleground for groups with varied affiliations.  Some of these affiliations are more of an affliction than anything else. Such groups  do well to contain the ability of its followers to think and act rationally. The first  thing that dies after you identify with a group is your ability to question people and  challenge their understanding or position on something. Most of the hashtags that trend have something to do with either politics, sports,  or entertainment. There are ways to turn off hashtags that you don't wish to see.  Navigate to the right-hand side of the app and locate a dropdown arrow on the side.  In the dropdown, you will see an option this trend is low quality. Select that to hide  that particular hashtag for you. You can also block duplicate hashtags. Hiding such  hashtags will help you locate better content. You  can  also  search  for  information  using  the  search  function   with  or  without  hashtags  and see connected Tweets. If none of the above works, change the trending  location to places where you are likely to find more relevant content. 7.3 Medium Medium  claims  to  be  a  place  for  people  to  discover  ideas,  knowledge,  and  perspectives and they are telling the truth. Medium helps you connect with potential  opportunities by promoting your thoughts and ideas expressed in the form of an  article. It does take some effort to write an article but with some effort, you will be  able to do it and your effort will be worth it. If you become a top writer on Medium, then the sky is the limit. Here is why Medium  works:       Medium makes you think like a journalist. Your stories must sustain attention   and your headline must be catchy enough to draw someone to read it.    It is all about sharing a unique perspective, so it makes you think differently.    You can share your Article across other social channels and build traction        and followers.          You can publish your collection of articles later as a book.    You can earn as well.   It's great from an SEO perspective  Is also a great place to get speaker invites if your content is good enough     Great place to showcase your portfolio       Making presentations is the best way of gaining a grip on the topic    Your data will reach places your resume won't and create openings     102      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code 7.4 SlideShare the hidden link All of you who are reading this book must have a LinkedIn account. About 70 percent  may have a Twitter account but are not using it or are using it for other interactions.  That's my guestimate. I could be wrong here. But I am quite sure that only a minority  of you would be using SlideShare. Here is why SlideShare works better than you think:           One of the slides I did for a smart city IoT use case on SlideShare got picked up by  PricewaterhouseCoopers. It was published with due attribution. This shows how far  your content can travel with a slight push. What matters on SlideShare is consistency. You should be able to post with consistency  and with good content that includes well-crafted slides with clear bullet points. 7.5 Other channels You can also use Instagram and Pinterest. These two can be used to post infographics.  YouTube can be used to post videos of your learnings or your reviews of a trend or  something interesting. Redditt can be used to post snippets or news links. All posting rules that were discussed previously apply here as well. 7.6 It's mostly about content Well-crafted and engaging content is a must if you have to attract attention to your  profile. What does good content look like?   It is current, relevant and unique                Makes people think and pushes them to share a thought or opinion           It is crafted well free of basic grammatical mistakes and typos It is not copied blindly from some site If it is taken from another site, attribute it and give it a short introduction  telling people what made you share that specific content        Has nothing to do with politics. This is a big turnoff   Getting Hired Through Social Media      103              Sometimes  people  post  stuff  that  is  slightly  or  entirely  controversial.  Sometimes  people use these channels to attack profiles, job categories, senior management, etc.  You should be mature enough to know not to do that. Cross-social media things to do:       No matter how much you change or adjust your privacy settings, people will  have some level of access to your pictures and posts. So, no matter what you,  keep your posts and photographs respectful. This is a basic rule. If there are good and recent conversations happing on relevant topics, join  the discussion and share your thoughts and perspectives            Make sure you come out as a knowledgeable and self-driven person    Use social media to do background research on companies and teams of   interest. Don't cross boundaries of privacy while doing that?     Avoid using too many buzz words in your posts    Do not showoff or confuse LinkedIn for FB and Twitter for LinkedIn    Figure out how to stay visible and give more visibility to your posts. How do   you do that? Cross-post. It also helps you enhance your credibility         Do not over post.    Be clear about what you want to get out of social media.      One last question on your mind would be, what kind of content should I share? So  let me give you a few examples of some great content that you can post often:    Infographics:  well-designed  infographics  prepared  by  you  or  posted  by  others shared with due credit and attribution Information on unique use cases        News updates    Mashable videos    Pieces of information from latest trend reports  that are publicly available     Links to your blogpost                 These are easy to obtain and publish content that is among the most social media- friendly content out there. Work on these or other information that you wish to  share and then work out a social media posting calendar for each week and follow  it rigorously. Always remember. You can sell anything on social media or through social media.  So why hold back on using these powerful channels to further your career interests?  These channels play a huge role in building a personal brand for yourself. I will cover  personal branding in a separate chapter. You must act with a plan that includes steps  such as identifying the channels you will be active on, content strategy, traction, and   Interesting information from your company   104      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  networking plan, getting the minimum acceptable results, measuring success, and  draw milestones for each of these steps:  Cha-  nnel Account Objec- tive Net- Link  work  edIn build- ing  and job  search  @ JohnDoe  Posting  Freq-  uency 1-2  times  a week   first  half of  week  and  second  half   KPIs  Traction  results  Top  Content  Audience  Information  Strategy   Con- nection  request  visit  from a  recruiter  Post  on AI  usage  by law  enforce- ment  agen- cies  30 percent  of senior  leaders and  15 percent  visits from  the target  company  Assess  ment  of  tactics Posted  at 10  am on  Tues- day  The arti- cle was  well-re- ceived  gather- ing 1300  views in  the first  18 hours.

To turn these dreams into reality, you need to start monitoring your  progress.  Ideal posting frequency:         Conclusion So far, we have seen how to use social media to build a strong case for companies  to  hire  you.  In  the  next  chapter,  we  will  delve  deep  into  job  search  techniques.  Social media can be a strong ally in your search for a challenging and professionally      LinkedIn: Once or twice a week    Twitter: Once a day at the very least    Medium: Once a week or as and when you have good content    SlideShare: Once a week   Getting Hired Through Social Media      105  rewarding career. When done well, it bestows multiple advantages and creates a  strong differentiator for you. Instead of using social media to just follow influencers and groups, become a content  creator, and start creating value for others. Question and answers 1.        Ans. I don't think so. Unless you grow into an established thought leader and   Is there any way to avoid social media as a recruitment tool?  people start approaching with offers at events, parking lots, and airports.                                   2.   Is the separation of personal and professional profiles possible on social  media?    Ans. Yes, to some extent. Instead of looking it that way, why should you  keep your personal and professional lives so delineated that you turn into  a different person in your personal life from the one that you are in your  professional  existence?  Some  channels  do  serve  a  specific  purpose.  For  instance, you shouldn't be posting your vacation pics on LinkedIn that should  be done on a platform like Facebook. No matter where you are, keep your  posts professional, and never use less than the civil tone in any conversation.  3.  How do I build a content calendar for my social media accounts?   Ans. Look at the social media audit table above. Use that to figure out a  plan for preparing and posting content.  There are many examples available  online as well. You can download one and tailor it to your objectives.   4.   What are the generic rules for producing and posting content on social   media?    Ans. I have already shared some of these. But I will summarize them again:    Never post when you are angry or very happy. Extreme emotions and   social media do not go well.     Avoid content that belongs to someone else. If you must post, post it   with attribution.     Your posts should add value to people that is a golden rule.    There are the best times for posting on each platform. You can use that   as well. There are enough articles on the web for this.     Never  argue  on  social  media.  Always  respect  everyone  and  their   opinion.     Never spam.   106      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code   Job Search      107  Chapter 8 Job Search  Introduction So far, you have had a good resume; you are also active on social media and are  slowly becoming more visible to recruiters everywhere. If this has indeed happened,  your job search has already started. From here on, you must learn how to keep tabs  on jobs that are hidden or are hard to come by for various reasons. Through this  chapter, you will get ideas on how to align your job search and get that job faster. Let us now go back in time a bit. Imagine those days when you were fresh out of  college or were looking for your first job or first change of job. How were those days  like? Have you changed your methods, or are you still pretty much using the same  tactics? The majority of us know only one way of searching for jobs. Which is by  conducting a job search on a job site and forwarding one's resume to the consultant  or the hiring manager? Some of us do this on LinkedIn and get frustrated when they  don't hear from the company. I have covered this in the previous chapter. Let's face it. Not many of us enjoy searching for jobs as it often means that you are  not happy with your current job or are looking for a change for some other reason.   We want to be hired as and when we become available in the job market. Any delay  is frustrating and tests your patience.   Job search diligence practices     Work on a job search strategy    Use the information shared here to connect with ET jobs faster     Understanding the fundamentals of ET job search    What are ET recruiters looking for?       Methods and results  108      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code Structure In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:         Objectives After studying this unit, you should be able to:     8.1 What's different in the world of ET? So, if you thought finding a regular job was tough, finding an ET job can sometimes  be even more daunting. These are some of the challenges involved:    Not many vacancies are advertised      No formal process involved in the recruitment      These companies do not often have a huge budget to advertise such vacancies      Vacancies are closed faster as the requirements are almost always immediate   I am part of a few groups on WhatsApp that discuss IoT and IoT Security. I have  often seen fellow members post job vacancies in such groups. Such activity was  not limited to smaller companies and start-ups alone. I have seen vacancies from  companies like IBM and Bosch being shared as well. But you will never come to  know of such openings unless you are a member of one of these groups. 8.2 Where to start? Job search demands 3 Ds from you. These Ds are discipline, diligence, and dedication.  There is some basic groundwork that you must do when it comes to commencing  your job search. Here are some mandatory tasks that should be part of your to-do  list:       Set up Google alerts: You know how to do this, don't you? Pick up a set of  keywords that match your dream role, tech, and even company if required.  Here are a few examples related to blockchain relevant to your ET job search:  blockchain scientist, blockchain vacancy, blockchain job opening, and so on. Notice  how I have kept the keywords broad and slightly unspecific? Well, that is    Job Search      109  to ensure that you get to do the filtering rather than Google. Such broad  settings also help you connect with the latest trends from the world of the  tech or company you wish to work for. Remember two things. First, Google  Alerts doesn't cover social media and that it is not very precise. Sometimes,  it doesn't generate alerts or gives you slightly stale information. Factor all  these in when you are planning to prepare a plan or activate Google Alerts.    Network:  Develop  contacts  across  industries  including  friends,  family,  neighbors, college alumni, association members, and people who can help  generate job leads or connect you with recruiters and other key people. Also,  plan on attending as many networking events as time permits. This includes  industry events, media events, award ceremonies, etc.     Learn a foreign language: You have no idea how much this could push your   case.     Motivate yourself to be prepared for the long haul. If required, take a break  either at the beginning on in the middle to refresh yourself. This can also  help prevent you from becoming a cynic, which could impact your interview  performance in the future and slow down your chances of getting hired.     Develop enthusiasm: This is another important aspect. It gives you an edge   over the competition.  Now that the basic hygiene is taken care of, let us move on to some deeper aspects.  In a world where there is no competition, it is easier to get complacent. On the other  hand, a prolonged job search could drain you out and leave less energy for your  transition to the new role. So, you need to spread your focus and energies to avoid  such a scenario. Your job search should always be planned and executed with an agenda. Here are a  few things to remember on the execution front:       Do not stop taking up any new responsibility in your current role while you  are searching for a new one. A caveat here would be to avoid taking on a new  role if it demands more attention and time from you     Keep distractions away    Your motivation levels should be high throughout the execution phase    Record your learnings; they will help you later                      110      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code        Keep a weekly progress chart as shown in Table 8.1:  Tasks  Week  Schedule   Stage  Status  Resume  update  02  04 April  2020  Ad- vanced  Preced- ing steps Updating  your  LinkedIn  profile  Next  steps Resume  circula- tion  To be  closed by  27 Feb  Com- ments  On-track  Augmen- tation  plan Spoke to  an expert;  will read  a book on  resume  on Feb  4, watch  some tips  from ex- perts on  YouTube  Table 8.1: Social media progress chart  Job  search  for  me  was  a  period  of  intense  learning.  Throughout  the  period,  I  maintained a journal of my learning and made mental notes on what inputs I was  getting from the interactions I was having with folks from the industry. Since my  learning throughout the job search phase was intense, I joined my ET role with an  expanded capacity to absorb information as also a template to learn quickly. If I had  treated my job search like a job search alone, I wouldn't have been able to keep my  learning going into the new role. 8.3 What are ET recruiters looking for? I  have  answered  a  part  of  this  question  in  previous  chapters.  I  will  give  you  more details here. Most recruiters are searching for candidates who can be easily  presented before a hiring manager. In the retail sector, when you are out shopping  for groceries, you need to be careful to pick vegetables individually else there are  chances of broken or vegetables with lesser qualities being picked. The same is true  with hiring. Sometimes because of the pressures that recruiters face, they present an  assorted set of candidates who range from those who are overqualified for the role  to those who are almost there or not there yet. Recruitment is not always done based on your skillsets and experience alone. Places  that value your growth potential, your analytical and leadership capabilities are also  around, and these are the places that you should strive to work as the chances of  your potential being expressed tangibly is way more in such companies. There are  ways of identifying such companies, and it is up to you to identify them. Here are a  few parameters to identify such companies       Pay attention to the job description if it lists out a set of core needs and  peripheral requirements along with a clear indication of flexibility, it is a  good sign.   Job Search      111       Job ads that say similar experiences are worth further investigation.        Check out the kind of people who are working there and their background.  Have you seen a data analyst turn into a threat researcher? Have you seen  a product manager turn into a business analyst, etc.? There is a background  transition  rate  in  any  organization.  It  could be  around  1  in  100  for  large  organizations and about 2 in 25 for smaller ones. But if you see too many  examples,  it  is  a  clear  sign  that  the  workplace  values  transition. A  large  services  company  used  to  make  people  work  on  different  technologies  every 8 months. But this was purely from a bench strength standpoint  such  movements are not helpful . So, lookout for people who have changed roles  at least once in the last 2 years and how much they have been able to add  value in their new roles.     Companies that allow individuals to retain IP.      Companies where people at all levels have published good books.        Companies where the organizational structure is not pyramidal or traditional. Organizations  with  entrenched  thought  leaders  often  exhibit  thought  leadership  with much ease, and they are the ones who often take a huge lead in innovation over  the competition. Most ET companies fall in this league. In one of the ET companies I  used to work, filing patents were so common that they stopped celebrating grant of  patents. Such places are like a breath of fresh scented air in an otherwise stale work  environment that we often encounter. Such companies also give wide room for a range of skillsets to join them. Their  recruiters  work  hard  to  get  interesting  and  promising  candidates  onboard.  The  process  does  fail  in  some  instances  as  candidates  sometimes  fake  their  way  throughout. At no point will I motivate you to be fake any part of your academic or  professional career. Build a case on your strengths and work on aspects that are not  strong to make them competitive as well. When you are trying to enter the ET workforce, your priority should be to identify  such places and network with people there. But beware of organizations that appear  to be such a place but are not so in reality  I have covered this in detail in previous  chapters . 8.4 Phases of job search Typically, a job search moves across 3 phases. Diligence, application building, and  resume modification and finally preparing for an interview. I will cover the interview  part in the next chapter. In the diligence phase, you need to work to understand  what the market wants. In the world of ET, your job search must proceed vertically  and horizontally. By vertical, I mean within the industry that you already belong to,  and the horizontal bit refers to other verticals.   112      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Suppose you are part of the financial technology industry and are seeking a role  with  a  Fintech  company  that  is  working  on  blockchains.  You  are  halfway  there  already. But if you are working in the financial service sector and want to work for a  company that has built an IoT platform, you have your work cut out. 8.4.1 Diligence While doing your diligence, calculate the distance between your dream role and  where you are now. This can be done by using the format given in Table 8.2: Job trait  for the job you   Difference  are seeking   Exposure to the vertical  Role   actual  role;  say  a  business analyst   Core skillsets    10 100  Significance of the trait 5 10 10 100  Strength of matching  trait in current role  5 10 2  assuming that you are  currently in sales  4  write down each skill- set  called  out  and  do  a  line by line comparison    0 8  6  Parameter 4 Parameter 5 Parameter n  Table 8.2: Distance to your dream job  Cover  as  many  parameters  as  you  can  so  that  you  can  draw  a  more  accurate  comparison. Sum up the totals in the last column. If the sum is in double digits,  above 20, then you have a challenge at hand. But this is nothing to get disheartened.  It just means that you need to work a bit harder. While  you  are  searching  for  jobs,  compare  the  key  requirements  that  different  companies have assigned to the role you want. Using this comparison, identify the  bare minimum needs and then use the above table to derive a separation quotient or  SQ, which denotes your distance from that role. Use SQ in your diligence phase to prepare your job application, resume, and cover  letter. 8.4.2 Search For your actual job search, use as many allies as you can. Ideally, you should be  on  multiple  job  sites.  Recommended  ones  include  Indeed,  Monster,  Glassdoor,  and Jooble. Others include BambooHR, Zoho Recruit, Workable, Jobvite.com, and  Recruiterbox.com.  If  you  haven't  heard  of  Jooble,  well,  they  give  you  access  to  hidden jobs. That doesn't appear on any other job search sites. Don't forget to check  them out. There are many other sites out there that use Google and your network to  find and use them.   Job Search      113  Make sure that you read online reviews before you post your resume as you might  be targeted by spammers. If you are targeting an international role, many sites focus  on specific countries. Such sites will help you discover jobs that are not posted on  mainstream sites. Using LinkedIn to apply for such jobs is as good as not applying.  LinkedIn is not a recommended platform for searching for jobs, as I have mentioned  before. But, if you are willing to invest in improving your profile and updating it  constantly, recruiters will reach out to you. So,  what  can  you  do  in  case  you  want  to  apply  for  a  role  posted  on  LinkedIn?  One suggestion would be to reach out to the hiring manager on Twitter. Drop a  personalized note and see if you can strike up a conversation. If you are unable to  see if you can meet them at an event that he or she or their teammates are attending   ideally with a booth presence . You can get information on events by following the  company on social media. If you are planning to meet them at events, make sure that you meet them early in  the day as they will be drained by the end of the day. During the event hours, they  will be too busy. 8.5 Finding the hidden jobs A  significant  proportion  of  jobs  out  there  are  never  advertised.  This  means  you  will never hear about them. These jobs are often filled by utilizing the networks of  employees or other means. Unless you have your ears to the ground and are quick  on your feet, you might end up missing these roles. Job portal Jobvite's Job Seeker Nation Survey report released in 2019 claims that  even though a majority of applicants apply for jobs on a job board or employer  career site, as many as 35% found job postings on social media, 50% heard about jobs  from friends, while 37% said that they learn about jobs from professional networks.  Australian government's job portal Job Jumpstart claims that as many as 1 out of  every 5 jobs are never advertised. Why do companies use hidden job markets for hiring?       They feel that they will be able to get better quality of candidates by tapping   into the network of their employees. It is cheaper.        Companies won't have to deal with a large pool of applicants many of whom   are not the best fit.     Employees are often given incentives to bring their friends or colleagues on   board thus helping companies gel better with employees. It is a quieter way of bringing candidates on-board. Especially if the project  is a classified one.                  114      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  People often reveal more information on social media than anywhere else. So, it is  a good place to start if you are looking to unravel openings that are not advertised  elsewhere. Look out for clues. For instance, if you connect with someone who is  currently holding the role you want to step into and you get an alert saying they  have moved on to a new role or company, should you get excited? Well maybe.  People update their profiles after they have settled in a new role. By that time, his or  her previous company would have found someone, so that is not a foolproof way.  But sometimes, companies struggle to fill up a vacant role so the position may still  stay vacant long after the horses have bolted. There is another possibility altogether. In the world of ET, the companies often request  the outgoing employee to promote the vacancy in their circle. I have done that in the  past as well. So, by being connected with those employees, you get a chance to learn  about the vacancy well in advance. You can even request the outgoing employee to  share your resume with the hiring manager. Another way is to set alerts for the company using Google. This will help you stay  connected with the news and updates from the company, and you will also know of  vacancies that may have arisen.  Other strategies are as follows:       Build a network of informers in the target company. You can reach out to   them via your network.        Recruitment  consulting  firms  are  often  the  first  ones  to  know  of  people  moving or looking out. Try to connect and befriend them. I always make it  a point to have long conversations with recruiters when they reach out to  discuss an opening.     Find out what methods they have used to fill vacancies in the past.    Subscribe to news alerts from the company of your choice.    You can also use Google. Use the string site:ipseum.com IoT developer.        Using  directories  is  another  way  of  connecting  with  a  job.  Sites  like  AngelList,  GetApp, and Product Hunt can be good places to start. They also offer many search  filters to narrow down your effort. 8.6 Activate your network Where can you find people who can help you?         Your LinkedIn connections    Email contact list: Your mailbox contains contacts of people who can help   you        Slack channels   Job Search      115     Twitter and direct messages    Facebook groups or private messages    Community sites and forums: Inbound, GrowthHackers, HackerNews        Let your close friends know you are looking out for a role. You never know where  your next lead will come from. Keep all options open.  Let us look at some of the  mistakes that people do during a job search:       Operating without a plan or strategy: This is more common a problem than  one can imagine. Most job seekers think that the only decision they need to  take when it comes to job search is to decide when to start. This is indeed a  flawed way of doing things. A good job search proceeds with a well-etched  plan.                                        Lack of consistency in efforts: There are job seekers who search for jobs in  waxing and waning phases. They search actively when they are not happy  in their current role and then stop looking out if things work out. This is a  dangerous way of doing things as you will not be able to learn from your  mistakes or maintain momentum. Ignoring social media during the search phase: Have covered this enough  in the previous chapter  Ignoring networks and other influencers: Being connected with folks at the  highest levels makes your job search easier.     Getting disheartened early: Sometimes, we give up easily just because we  feel intimidated by the task at hand. You must be patient and hopeful. No  two ways about it.     Applying  without  any  diligence:  I  have  seen  folks  applying  to  certain  positions just because they like to work for a certain employer. That again is  something that should ideally be avoided. Applying without thinking also  makes the task harder for you as you will be disheartened by lack of results    Failing  to  customize  outbound  communication:  Have  mentioned  this  before. Make sure you are writing and communicating with a human being  and not a system.     Not paying enough attention to the job description: How many of us are  guilty of using the same resume for various roles? I am guilty of this sin,  as well. But the moment I started customizing my resume for the job I was  applying  to,  the  results  started  improving  dramatically.  I  started  getting  more calls and offers. So, attention to detail is what you need to pay. As they  say, dot your I's and cross your T's.     Being too attached to their current job: I have seen folks who board the job  search ship in two minds. A part of them wants to stay while a part of them  wants to go. You must decide where you want to be, and again this is a non- negotiable requirement. I am not asking you to stop paying attention to your    116      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  current role but to pay more attention and focus on the job search. You will  still have to meet your deadlines and KRAs in your current role but bring  about a sense of priority for your job search.  You need to address these aspects before we move on. I am not going into detail on  each aspect, as I know you are capable of doing that. Look at all the mistakes I have  mentioned and see which ones you commit often. Fixing these mistakes alone will  result in your job search, turning more successful in the short run, and you will be  attending more interviews for sure. Let me take up the last point, though. In one of my previous roles, I had a colleague  who was trying hard to get a new role. But every time she got an interview call, she  would press the panic button and act as though she was quitting. She would start  imagining her farewell party and even start missing her colleagues, and then she  would develop cold feet and then psychologically try to lower her chances of getting  selected. I have seen variants of this behavior in many people I know, and trust me,  and nothing disrupts your chances of getting a great role than having two minds  about moving on. In personal and professional life, getting one's priorities right is an important step in  getting closer to a goal that one has set. Unless we are certain that we can do justice  to the transformative process that the role change would bring, it will be difficult to  move on. Fear of change is also a reason why people cling on to the known devil; it  happens more often in our personal lives as well. If you were ever in a situation where you get overwhelmed, always remember what  Branson once said: If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity, but you are not sure you can do it, say yes  – then learn how to do it later! Change, almost always, brings about an opportunity, but it also brings forth the  unknown. But the unknown is just something awaiting discovery, and depending on  how you see it, there is a definite chance for growth there. You stop growing physically  by the age of 25, but you never stop growing as a person and as a professional, and  it is purely up to us to hasten that evolution by presenting ourselves before such  unknowns. So, don't ever get so attached to a routine that you don't even hear the  whispers of change gently knocking on your door. 8.7 Getting ahead It is always important to stay inspired and look at examples of folks around us to  motivate us. Competition is there for a reason. Just like a failure, competition helps  us focus on aspects that missed our attention while we were busy with the execution  of our plans. And it is seldom too late to make amends.   Job Search      117  I have heard at least a few folks around me complaining about various aspects of the  economy, competition, and even government. As someone once said, the only part  of the universe you can change is your personality and what you wish to become. In 1991, an event happened whose tremors are felt even to this day. Like a giant  supernova, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or the USSR imploded. Ukraine,  Russia,  and  Belarus  dissolved  the  union  and  walked  away  independent  of  the  structure  that  had  survived  at  least  one  major  global  conflict  and  more  than  4  decades of the cold war. I was in school those days but could very well understand  that things will never be the same again. It is said that after the Soviet Union dissolved, many sleuths from the CIA of the  USA put in their papers. They were convinced that their country was now free of  adversaries, and thus, they were not required anymore. Well, the events of 9 11  proved otherwise. There are two lessons to be learned from the collapse of the USSR. One that unless  you keep up with the times and move at a pace that is aligned to the aspirations  and needs of your citizens, you run the risk of dissolution. So, as a professional, you  always need to keep your goals aligned to the highest level of potential you hold.  The Soviet Union was unable to do that for its citizens. An archaic structure with an  underfunded economy and needless geopolitical interventions and an endless arms  race brought the USSR down. You should be able to set goals that help you realize your inner potential and express  it to the maximum possible extent or run the risk of becoming redundant. Situations  around you might overwhelm and surpass you, leaving you behind. The second lesson has to do with competition. Never imagine that you will ever be  free of it. It is always advisable to watch out for known competitors while making  room for new or stealthy ones. Let your competition inspire you or, at the very least,  challenge you to do better than what you would have otherwise done. But do not let caution bleed you or let you enter an endless race of attrition that  harms the very essence of your professional existence. You must accept the existence of these forces while you continue your hunt. Stay  motivated and stay charged because this will be the most grueling part of your  journey towards ET. This is also a phase wherein:           There will be less certainty.    This period might seem like an endless one. Time may slow down for you.    You will have fewer reasons to be confident as many applications won't elicit   a reply.          People might pull you down or demotivate you.    Events might seem more daunting than they are.   118      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Developing and applying tons of patience     Trying our new and innovative strategies for success     Perseverance     Developing an unwavering focus on goals   So, learn to be on top of your game. Your confidence will take place. Be confident, but  not arrogant. Confidence will add wind to your sails, while arrogance will perforate  it.  At the end of your job search, when you get called for an interview, and you crack  it, you will have lots to be thankful for. A methodical job search done with ample  diligence and commitment cannot just do wonders for your career but also provide  a strong learning foundation for your career. The key takeaways from this phase  include strategies that will aid in:         These are just the key aspects. If you are willing to dissect your job search phase,  you identify many lessons that will be of use in your personal and professional life  in the future. 8.8 Building a great pitch Be it an email interaction or your resume; your pitch should be powerful enough  to  land  you  an  interview  call. Your  pitch  should  necessarily  have  the  following  elements:         The pitch you are sharing will be an elevator one. Which is to say that it will be  concise, precise and convey the message using few words? Elevator pitch is used to  introduce something quickly and clearly to spark interest and further conversations. Write down multiple variants of your pitch and then eliminate the ones you feel are  not doing justice to your profile and aspirations. Typically, a good pitch comes out  after about 23 rounds of iterations, so be prepared for the long haul. Here is an example of a wrong elevator pitch I'm a sales leader with experience of over a decade in heading connected vehicle sales teams  successfully while delivering extraordinary results.  Dull and drab; years of experience may  not be a strong differentiator      Your core value proposition    Your interest in this role and why you are the best fit    A mention of skills that will help you in the role you are seeking    Link to your online profiles and work   Job Search      119  Here is an example of something that will spark interest: I  am  sure  you  have  heard  that  the  best  sales  folks  work  at  70  percent  pipeline  velocity.   Attention locked . Yes, that's true. In the last two years, I have been clocked at 70 percent  velocity 89 percent of the time. It is this velocity that has helped me in clocking revenue faster  through faster closure. I will discuss this number in detail during our next conversation. The above conversation will lead to a deeper discussion, and you can be sure about  that. Notice how the candidate has only revealed details that will pique curiosity?  That's the way to do it. Make sure your words generate enough impact to make your  resume move faster towards an interview. Going back to the evolution example, many people associate dinosaurs with legacy.  People  who  have  not  understood  this  class  of  reptiles  well,  often  use  the  term  dinosaurs to indicate a mindset that is stuck in an era long gone. The truth is, however, far from such assertions. Dinosaurs remain the most successful  class of animals to have ever graced the planet. They were able to outlast many  species and fill all ecological niches from animals that were as small as a dog to one  that weighed an incredible 77 tones. They lived for almost 190 million years, and it  took a humungous calamity to wipe them off the planet. Even in death, they left their  legacy behind and were never completely extinct. Birds are surviving dinosaurs.  They may not be as interesting and attention-drawing as dinosaurs of the past but  are their descendant's none the less. The point I want to amplify here is that one is never too old to make a move. So, no  matter where you are in your career, you can still manage that transition, and it is  up to you to showcase your value beyond doubt to those who could employ you.

This phase will help decide how far you go in your job search.  So, make sure you afford enough attention and time to this vital phase.   Impressing the Emerging Tech Jury      121  Chapter 9 Impressing the  Emerging Tech  Jury  Introduction So, you have got that interview letter. You are now excited and waiting to dive in. The  journey is not over yet, so keep your hat on. The ride is about to get bumpier. I have  interviewed many candidates in my career and have been part of many interviews  as well. In some cases, the interviewers were kind enough to share detailed feedback  for me to work on. But not all companies are in that league and many a time, you  will have to do your analysis to find out what went well and what didn't work. This is a make or break phase in your ET career. A good interview is about the 3 P's  which are preparation, presentation, and perseverance. In addition to these, you  also must have plenty of confidence to play from a position of strength  and not  arrogance . The skills you gain while preparing for your interview are also the skills  that you will need in almost every area of your life. So, buckle up and let's get started. Structure In this chapter, we will together explore ways to:                 Come out with ways to strengthen your pitch   Improve your interview preparation Identify the red flags during an interview    122      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                   Avoid common mistakes that candidates do     Understand how ET interviews are different from the others    Connect  your  interview  with  your  tenure  so  that  you  know  that  is  very   important to speak well and in an accurate manner during the interview   Objective      interview      To prepare for and deliver a successful interview    Understand  the  forces  that  have  a  strong  bearing  on  the  outcome  of  an      Learn how to evaluate your performance     Let us look at how far you have come to reach here. You have:      Figured out a new role in an exciting field for yourself     Found out ways to uplift yourself personally and professionally to meet the     requirements of this goal     You have made new professional acquaintances     Your social media presence is now stronger than ever     Your resume is a not just a document but is instead a memorable pitch that   has drawn more than one prospective employer towards you     You have tons of learning to fall back on     You are now more confident than ever       9.1 Understanding the process So pat yourself on your back and get ready to hop on to the next phase of your  emerging tech journey. The journey from here will be slightly less uncertain. But the  battle is not over yet, so be prepared. In the world of ET, a hiring manager is an influential person. They have the power to  accept or reject candidates. This may be the case for other segments, but in the world  of ET, running into a jury is a rare phenomenon. Still, it does happen occasionally  and  hence  the  topic  of  this  chapter.  You  need  to  be  prepared  to  be  grilled  by  more than one individual. Grilled is the wrong word to use here. An interview is  a conversation, and it is essential to understand that you are not here to subject  yourself to interrogation but to participate in a discussion to see if things work out  for both sides. Beyond ensuring that you need to crack the interview, you also need to do a bit of  questioning to learn:    If the company a good fit for me?       Impressing the Emerging Tech Jury      123         Is the work environment nurturing and does the company have a good work  culture?        Do I see a future for myself here?    What drives or motivates people here?    Does what you see match your expectations?    Do they recognize and appreciate employees?    How innovative are they?            A mistake can set your career back by a few months, at the very least. You are also  incurring an opportunity cost by saying yes to this job, which implies saying no  to  many  others  that  may  have  helped  you  more.  So  never  make  the  mistake  of  attending an interview just as a candidate. Instead, become an auditor or, at best,  an investigator who is out to unearth the truth. You cannot afford a mistake at this  stage. 9.2 Red flags Can interviewers or hiring managers waste your time? The answer is yes. Based on  my interactions with people, I have come across the following types of time-wasters:      People who try to figure out what you are tackling a few challenges in your   current role and absorb that information to replicate it later.     Some hiring managers would have already decided on which candidate to  hire, but they still get into interviews just to show that the due process has  been followed.       People go ahead with the interviews without getting a headcount approval. The good news is that this doesn't happen too often in the world of ET startups or  even in the case of established companies. This is because no one has the time to  indulge in such a waste of time and attention. But having said this, some individuals  do put candidates through such episodes that don't lead to anything. This is entirely  unacceptable.  This slows down your job search and is a partial waste of time. Partial,  because you might still end up learning something from such interactions. The basic courtesy expected from hiring managers is simple feedback. Have you  been selected or not. In many cases, you don't even get to hear that. Again this is a  systemic problem that plagues many companies. Feel free to shortlist such companies  and avoid engaging with them in the future. 9.3 Preparation The world of ET runs on use cases. Your ability to conceptualize and think through  use cases is something that will help you engage the interviewer or hiring manager  or both better.   124      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  How vital are the use cases? To give you an example, a few years back, when I was  with a different employer, we were working to build visibility for our IoT solutions  in the market. It was then that I came across a news article. The news item spoke  about how a blood bank in Mumbai had flushed 100s of liters of blood into the  drains. The reason? Because they were not sure if the blood units were still viable. A clear business case emerged. Blood banks need to know if the units are still viable  or not. This was a pressing need, and we had a solution that could just help them  do that. We connected the article to the solution and wrote a contributory piece in  a newspaper, and the story went viral. The connection was established, and we  were fielding plenty of sales queries within 48 hours. The solution was just what the  industry needed, but we were not sure of a pressing need that is addressed. No matter which role you apply for, your ability to imagine and decipher use cases  is a necessary trait. It will not just help you get a job but also in moving faster within  the organizational hierarchy, and if you end up in a role that has a lot to do with sales  or consulting sales, you will be in demand no matter what you do. As part of your preparation, pay attention to these details other than the role and the  verticals they cater to:       Case studies or customer wins. Understand what exactly the challenge is  they are addressing for their customers. Don't stop there. Look at how the  solution they offer could be used to solve other problems in other industries.  Can you open up a new market for them?     Try and build a solution roadmap for them and include in its new challenges      that they may encounter in the future.          Build a unique and innovative use case for them.    See if you can identify a challenge their solution can address today, but they   are not calling it out.  These are just a few things. I am assuming that you will do diligence on the job  description and KRAs without hesitation. The above exercise will help you understand  the role better and go beyond just answering queries from your interviewer. It will  provide depth to your pitch and make a strong impression on the interviewer or  the jury. It is your way of traveling that extra mile. Trust me, this will not improve  your chances of being employed, but it will also transform your career in ways you  cannot even imagine. Let me underscore the above assumption. With this element added to your repertoire  of benefits your prospective employer gains, you will be able to:       Think better and be ready to field questions outside the job description or   role requirements        Have a more in-depth conversation with people who matter and showcase   your ability to think and do more   Impressing the Emerging Tech Jury      125           Prepare for the whiteboard moments where the interview panel asks you to   explain your approach using whiteboard and stationery     Embrace  resource  thinking.  Helping  you  understand  how  to  optimize   resource usage and prevent wastage in projects     Leverage conversational threads to build a use case    Do better presentations    Be ready if you are asked to do some exercise        Other aspects of preparation include finding out more about the company using  Glassdoor and other review portals, seeing the social media posts from the company,  listen to what their leaders are speaking about at events and if they have filed any  information with a regulatory authority and the data is available in public domain  access that data. 9.4 Focus on building a conversation No  matter  where  you  work  in  the  future,  communication  is  a  trait  that  will  determine your career trajectory and your elevation. In the many interviews that I  have conducted, with prospective candidates, I have seen these issues emerge often:         A candidate being on the defensive always. Not asking any questions    Speaking  too  much  about  themselves  without  giving  any  chance  to  the   interviewer to build a conversation        Not listening to the question and leaping to an answer before the question is   completed     Cutting the interviewer off    Using too many buzz words without context    Using the interaction to indulge in a monologue and a lengthy speech    Getting too informal very early in the conversation          An interview is not an occasion to speak endlessly. If you can showcase your superior  par listening skills and your ability to offer pointed answers, your chances of getting  hired to improve manifold. Remember this. Sample questions are as follows:               Why is this the time for your company to exist?    How do you solve a problem differently?    What do you consider as your biggest threat?    The most memorable milestone, your company, achieved in the last year?    How many patents has your company filled? Do you allow employees to   hold patents?   126      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code        The most significant change you have seen in this organization in the last   year, and how did it impact you?  These are not mere questions. Pay attention to the answers so that you get to hear  what the company will do for you in the future. Coming back to your interview preparation, you need to get prepared on multiple  fronts. If you are targeting a start-up, you can go beyond a conversation around use  cases. You can even give them a viable business and go-to-market model, funding  avenues and tapping strategy, and even ideas to keep the business going. Every  conversation that goes into these areas and is sustained will give momentum to your  application and acceptance. The golden rule is to ensure that your conversation is never unidimensional. This is one of the reasons why I have earlier encouraged you to meet teams from  your prospective employer at events. You need to have as many data points for  conversations. Meeting people at events also makes you understand their culture,  pitch, sales strategies, and prospects, engineering approaches, product strategy, and  even their market strengths. You might think that an event is all about marketing. Nothing could be farther from  the truth. Companies reveal more at events than you can imagine. You will get a slice  of so many aspects of the company that you will have a useful dataset to work on for  your questions, and if required, you can even use this data to figure out if you fit in  or not or even to determine if the company is worth working for. My advice on this  specific aspect is that no matter what; don't decide before you attend the interview.  Give them a chance. Hear things from the proverbial horse's mouth and then take a  decision. Does researching your interviewer help? This is not a question that can be answered through a simple yes or no. It always  helps if you research the company, its offerings, market, senior leadership, work  culture, and financial filings. It is always good to prepare yourself with information but avoid being snoopy. If it is  information that could feature in a conversation that you are going to have with the  interviewer and or the jury. Information makes you confident and also helps you  channel the conversation in a manner of your preference. There is no need to know everything under the sun. Be prepared to admit that there  are aspects that you are not entirely familiar with or do not understand. It will not  lower your standing. On the other hand, if you don't know something but are not  willing to admit it and create a story or a fabrication to conceal this fact is being  downright deceitful. Such a position can come back to haunt you later and, at its  worst, exposes your lack of confidence and insecurity.   Impressing the Emerging Tech Jury      127  9.5 Reflect on the past, understand the  present, and map the future You are not a soothsayer or a fortune teller, so you don't need to get everything right.  In one of my early interviews, I told my hiring manager that I see myself authoring  a book in 5 years. I got the timeline wrong, but my understanding of the direction I  was headed was correct. In any conversation, never make the mistake of being hung  up on the past  for glory or otherwise . Lessons from the past are valuable and so is how these lessons have shaped your  present or have helped you chart your future are all essential aspects. But being  hung up shows your reluctance to move on. Many times, we unknowingly start  talking ill about our previous employers or the problems we are facing in the current  role. Always remember that the interviewer is not a counselor who is being paid to  help you reduce your stress levels. You have to enter, engage, and exit an interview with and through a conversation  of  substance  that  makes  people  understand  your  professional  evolution  and  capabilities. In the world of ET, interviews are something that I have always looked forward to. In  addition to a chance to understand the trends related to technology I am connected  to, I also get a chance to connect with influencers and perspectives that wouldn't  have come my way otherwise. Some of the best conversations I have had in my  career and the ones that I remember most are those I have had with founders, c suite,  and others from the ET world. ET folks are overall more grounded, enthusiastic, passionate, and ready to learn and  unlearn. These are great traits, and if you wish to be part of a team like that, you  need to have these traits as well. If you are setting up a team or a startup, then it is  all the more critical that you possess these traits, showcase them when you can, and  lead by inspiration and example. Make people feel comfortable around you to indulge in exchange of knowledge and  information while giving ample room to listen and understand perspectives and  positions that are quite different from your own. I don't need to emphasize that any  argument with anyone at this stage won't help your cause, so be prepared to cede  ground. There is always a room for listening, remember that. 9.6 Looking ahead Your interview is more important than you can imagine. It sets the context for your  stint in the organization. These conversations, your posture, and your demeanor  will be stored for posterity in the minds of those who have interacted with you. So    128      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Hurting your chances of selection    Come back to haunt you later at some point in your tenure    Could end up spoiling your chances of growth, later    Make people question your credibility and permanently scar your career    You could be ignored for leadership roles and relegated  in a way, an interview becomes the most essential part of your legacy in that place.  Let that sink in for a moment. Your interview preparation should factor in this aspect. It is not just about today,  but  also  tomorrow  and  can  have  a  strong  bearing  on  everything  you  do  at  the  organization you join eventually. You should not even try to fake any part of the  whole process right from preparing your resume to giving your feedback on the  interview. If you misrepresent anything at this juncture, you could end up:           There are other implications, as well. We have had so many examples of leaders  fudging their resumes at the highest levels and paying for it with their jobs and  career prospects. In today's day and age, when your career track is available for  anyone to see online, trying to hide or manipulate information will be exposed faster  than you can imagine. Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson had to leave after just 4 months. Thompson's Yahoo  resume published online and the one that came in the company's annual report,  which is a legal document that CEOs have to swear personally, are truthful  to the  best of their knowledge  contained false statements. He claimed to hold a bachelor's  degree in both accounting and computer science from Stonehill College. The truth is  that his degree was actually in accounting only. Just imagine if Thompson had not had to lie and had stayed on, who knows Yahoo  could have survived and even grown. Now we will never know as the next CEO of  Yahoo, who came along with plenty of fanfare and pomp, left in disgrace and is said  to have harmed Yahoo to a point from where it could never recover. When you are a  leader, you are not just responsible for your well-being also that of the organization  and those who look up to you. Veritas Software's Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Lonchar resigned way back in 2002  after admitting that he lied about having a master's degree in business administration  from a place no less than Stanford University. In his parting statement, he said I  regret this misstatement of my educational background. Microsoft had its leader who misrepresented his academic credentials. Tang Jun,  who was the country head for China, was also China's highest-paid employee with  an annual salary of $14 million back in 2008. In July 2010, he was accused of falsely  claiming  to  have  a  Ph.D.  from  the  California  Institute  of  Technology  by  science  writer and blogger Fang Zhouzi. He didn't stop there. Tang also claimed he attended    Impressing the Emerging Tech Jury      129  both Caltech and Nagoya University in Japan in his doctored resume. Tang had also  written a book called My success is replicable wherein he repeated his claims. Fang Zhouzi did his investigation and in parallel asked Tang to provide the names  of professors in Caltech Tang had worked with. Tang was unable to do so and sued  Fang. Finally, Tang came clean in an interview and admitted that he didn't have  degrees from these institutions. Fang Zhouzi is an accomplished science writer. He has been battling pseudoscience  and academic misconduct across China for quite some time now. He earned his  doctoral  degree  in  biochemistry  in  1990  from  the  Michigan  state  university  and  has been working with various institutions involved in molecular genetics since  and at some point, in his career, he decided to take on the forces that were pushing  unproven science and people who were manipulating their resumes.  He survived  an assassination attempt in the summer of 2001 after he questioned the academic  credentials of a noted Chinese urologist. Xiao Chuanguo, the urologist in question  hired thugs to attack Fang.  This shows the extent to which people can go to secure  their forgery even after knowing that they have a weak case. But despite these famous examples, people still fudge their resumes and comfortably  misrepresent  facts  during  interviews.  Candidates  presume  that  they  will  not  be  discovered or that they would be in a unique position by the time the truth catches  up with them. Both these assumptions are far-fetched and dangerous. It will never  be worth the risk no matter what doors it opens for you. In the world of ET, you could get exposed faster than you can imagine. Emerging  tech companies rely on employees to deliver unprecedented outcomes and do things  that they are not expected in traditional companies. Thus, if you have lied your  way into a company, your chances of being discovered remain high as you will be  expected to deliver in line with your credentials and the tall claims you have made  during the interview. At no point will I encourage you to indulge in misrepresentation or fudging. The  idea is to showcase your transferable skills and capabilities that could be of use for a  potential ET employer in the future. You should be intelligent enough to know when  you are bragging and when you are simply lying. If you don't, someone else might  do that for you:  Parameter  Discussions   Length of discussion   Traditional company   More in-depth,  conversations will focus on  specific JD points  Fixed duration  ET   It could be about anything.

Table 9.1: Differences between ET interviews and interviews with traditional companies  Once you understand and appreciate these differences, you will be able to factor  them in your preparation. You need to view the interview as a chance to take your  career to a whole new level and to open new windows of opportunity. When I was  preparing for my first ET interview, I kept the larger picture in mind, along with  short term goals. In  addition  to  researching  the  company,  role,  and  technology,  I  also  prepared  a  roadmap for my role, including a plan for hitting the ground running with minimal  handholding and very little time to take off using as less a runway as possible. One  thing that I didn't factor in was the resistance I could encounter from certain quarters  within the company I was joining. The role I was to take up was a dual reporting one. While I was reporting to my  manager  in  the  US,  I  had  a  dotted  line  to  someone  who  was  heading  the  local  operations. My dotted line manager had filled a few positions with people who had  always worked with him. This created problems for someone who was brought in  from a different organization to lead a function. The  first  4  months  in  this  organization  went  into  developing  and  deploying  workarounds so that my work was not impacted negatively by these circumstances  created from certain quarters. I  have  presented  this  example  here  to  make  you  think  more  about  the  kind  of  challenges that a role could present. You need to factor this in your planning process  while preparing for the interview. Should I be vocal about every challenge? The  short answer is no, and so is the long answer. Understanding these challenges will  help you prepare a more pragmatic plan. It also helps if you join a company where you end up encountering such problems.  So you see, an interview is not just about preparing for a good conversation with a  high pitch, but it is also about preparing a long term plan that you can execute once  you join an organization. You need not be a soothsayer, but you can be someone    Impressing the Emerging Tech Jury      131  who has thought through the whole process and understood the opportunities and  challenges well. 9.7 The one big differentiator Energy makes a huge difference. If you are an enthusiastic person and can convey this  energy without sounding weird, you've got it made at least as far as the foundation  is concerned. Interviewers prefer enthusiastic and warm candidates who are eager  to make a difference. Showcase your passion backed by diligence and your ability to  plan, and you are almost there. Unfortunately,  you  can  never  prepare  to  be  enthusiastic  because  that  would  be  a manipulation of behavior. But you can always inspire yourself in ways to stay  excited about the role or the company or any other aspect that might push your case. 9.8 Mistakes to avoid Before we conclude, let me highlight a few common mistakes and give you a few  tips to avoid them:       Not maintaining the right attitude: Being too cool, too energetic, or lacking  energy are all bad states to be in. You need to present a balanced version  of  yourself.  Before  you  walk  in,  make  sure  that  you  get  enough  time  to  acclimatize  gather your thoughts . Never rush into an interview and start  blurting out sentences just to fill the silence.     Not paying enough attention: This is nothing short of a crime. Be in the  moment when you turn up. Make sure you are listening to the person on  the other side of the table. I have seen candidates acting out of enthusiasm  cutting interviewers and not allowing them to speak. It is uncivil and shows  a lack of respect and courtesy. Clear your mind before you walk in.  Lack of preparation: almost all interviewers ask the same questions. Samples include:                       Tell me something about yourself.    How did you hear about this role?    Why did you decide to apply?    Share your biggest strengths?    What are your biggest weaknesses?    What are your thoughts about this company organization?    Why should we hire you?    Do you have any questions for us?    Give me an example of how you were able to [a situation connected to the      role].   132      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code         I am a born leader I a ________ hacker  growth, revenue, innovation   It is almost like appearing in an exam where the questions are always known. Yet  if  you  are  unable  to  give  satisfactory  answers  to  these  questions,  why  should  a  recruiter hire you? This displays a lack of the ability to apply one's thoughts or lack  of motivation to prepare. To avoid being in such a situation, always give a mock interview to someone you  know. You have no idea how effective this simple technique is. Talking ill about your past employers: doing this shows you in poor light. Speak  about the work you have done, how you were able to work around challenges, and  most importantly your learnings  if asked .  Keep the conversation positive and  professional. Using  jargon  and  clichés:  to  stretch  their  answers,  candidates  sometimes  use  all  kinds of clichés. Samples include:     Instead, focus on the results you have delivered and let the interviewer figure out  the skills associated with those results. Boasting too much is bad. No one likes to  listen to someone who exaggerates facts to astronomical scales. Avoiding my biggest weakness question: most candidates avoid this question or  give an answer that is not convincing. Samples:     Instead of such answers, focus on a challenge that you are trying to address and  show that you are trying to fix the problem. I am short-tempered but in the last six  months, I have kept my anger in check through counseling, meditation, and long  walks. I am still working on it. Not asking any questions: another common mistake. There are so many questions  available for you to pick from. You can choose a few and make sure you end the  conversation on a strong note. Asking interviewers questions makes them feel good  as well so it is a mandatory measure. Here are some questions you can ask:          Sometimes I give my team members too much freedom      Hope  I  have  answered  all  your  questions  to  your  satisfaction;  is  there   I get too involved in projects   anything you'd like me to clarify?                Do my qualifications match your expectations?    Which was your most memorable day at work here?     What the best part of working here?    What new skills do you feel I can learn here?    What would be the next steps?   Impressing the Emerging Tech Jury      133     You are selected    You are not     How big is the team?    What is one aspect of the work culture here that motivates you?       Don't just ask the question and get busy thinking about your next question. Pay  attention to the response and you might get your next question in the statements  coming your way. Following up on the interview: this is an interesting point. While most people will  tell you that it is essential to follow-up, I don't agree. Let me explain. If you attend  an interview, only two options are possible which are:     In some cases, the position may be kept on hold. If you are selected, they must  inform you. In case you are not, they need to inform you of that as well. That is a  basic courtesy due to you from the company and the people you interacted with.  So, in both cases, the logical outcome is an update. Under no circumstance can a  company keep quiet and wait for you to remind them of the position. I mean how  lazy, discourteous or absent-minded should the company people be for them to  forget to inform you. I mean someone connected with that position must ensure that  they communicate. Let us for a minute forget the above and imagine that you are still required to write  and seek an update. What difference can that make? When is the last time you've  heard  a  person  being  hired  because  they  did  a  follow  up  with  the  prospective  employer?  Now it might work in a few cases as there are always exceptions but  mostly, hiring managers would have zeroed in on a candidate and it is they who get  the offer letter. If you are not that candidate, then following up with a polite email  will not make any difference. Arriving  too  early late:  if  you  arrive  early,  make  sure  you  wait  not  to  seek  an  appointment with your hiring manager or HR point of contact too early. You can  always wait in the lobby or wait at a coffee shop or someplace close by. Always  remember that people may have other things on their minds and the last thing they  want is for you to pop in early and ask them to interview you ahead of schedule. I  don't think I need to explain why arriving late is bad. Talking continuously: you may end up revealing information that will make it easier  for the hiring manager to reject your candidature. Conclusion So now you know how to prepare and be ready for the most important conversation  of your career so far. You can use this information to plan, prepare, and structure  your interview conversation. As part of the preparation process, you can also ask    134      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  your friends or others to interview you. Ask them to ask you random and most  unexpected questions. This will help you think on your feet and react appropriately  when you face a volley of questions from the interviewer. In the next chapter, we will explore some essentials and secrets of the candidate  selection process in the ET world. Questions and answers 1.  How do I convey my USP during my conversations?       Ans. Prepare a list of 5-6 most essential messages that you want to convey.  Prioritize them and see how you can weave them into a conversation. It  should not appear forced or artificial. Organize your conversations in such a  way that you will create ample opportunities for communicating your USP.  This is also important from another standpoint. If your conversations are  well structured, you will spend less time talking about things that won't  add any strength to your candidature. The more time you spend discussing  random stuff, you create more chances of a slip-up leading to a rejection.            2.  What are the essential aspects of interview prep?   Ans. Understand why that role has been created. Look beyond the JD to  see the subtle hints that exist  maybe in a press release, an announcement  from a senior management executive, or directly in your conversation with  the HR person. Use all your points of contact to ascertain this. Once you  know the answer, the rest of your journey becomes way more comfortable.  Another essential preparation step is to look at ways in which you will solve  problems for the organization you are about to join. Figure out the challenges  that the company is dealing with and see how you can contribute to solving  them. Common problems include market traction, UI, UX challenges around  products, building a product roadmap, getting funding, brand recognition,  and more.  3.  How do I deal with pre-interview anxiety?   Ans.  Well,  never  make  the  mistake  of  viewing  interviews  as  grilling  or  interrogation  sessions.  Interviews  do  not  involve  alphabet  soup  agencies  trying to extract information from you. Treat interviews as conversations  where you wish to exchange knowledge and be prepared to listen and speak  in a manner that makes it easy for your interviewer to stay engaged in the  conversation. Sleep well, read good books, and stay confident.   Impressing the Emerging Tech Jury      135           4.  You  spoke about being an auditor  while giving  an interview.  Can  you   elaborate on this?    Ans. As I mentioned, your career is too short to waste working for companies  that are not up to the mark. So, make sure that you do enough investigation  of your own to figure out weaknesses and strengths. If you are attentive,  small facts do manage to trickle out of the most guarded interviewer. So, you  should be ready to grab such bits and use data gathered from other sources  to come to a logical conclusion.    You can attend the interview with a checklist in hand that also includes must  ask questions. Get as much clarity as you wish to. Unless there are time  constraints, you should be able to get enough questions answered by your  interviewer. If they don't have time, you can request them to connect you  with a colleague who can answer those questions on her behalf as well. No  harm in trying to know what's at stake.   136      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code   The Secret Sauce      137  Chapter 10 The Secret  Sauce  Introduction Wouldn't it be great if there were some ways by which we could reduce the learning  curve? Yes, that would save us some time. Keeping that in mind, this chapter is all  about sharing some information that could give you an edge without you having to  sweat a lot.  Structure In this chapter, we will together explore ways to:                   Come out with ways to strengthen your pitch.    This chapter is not about short cuts but is instead about strengthening your   Improve your confidence.

Some of the points may sound repetitive, but I have covered other aspects of  these points, and I have brought them here to underscore their importance.   138      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code Objective    with unpredictability.     Understand how you can take control of any situation by learning to live        Learn a few tricks of the trade that will help you fast track your career. 10.1 Make or break: when the odds are  even What is that one thing that can make or break your chances? The answer is a rather  long one. The secret sauce I am talking about is a series of steps you have to take  to bag the role you are after eventually. Again, I am not referring to short cuts or  cheat ideas or hack strategies, etc. These are steps that you have to take if you are  interested in doing a lot more in your career. So, these are essential tasks as should  be treated that way. 10.2 Keep your mind open and receptive Few people I know in the services technology sector are thrilled with the way their  career has shaped. That is good to know. But I wouldn't encourage you to feel the  same. A feeling of displacement is essential to keep your mind curious and open to  learning and evolving. If you feel you have arrived and feel settled in your career,  you automatically turn off a few avenues. Now I am not saying it is wrong, but just  that it is not advisable for you if you are reading this book and are targeting a role  in the ET sector. Long before I started my ET journey, I could feel that I was not doing justice to my  career and needed to do way more to attain my full potential. Over a while, this  became a starting point for my search for a career option that keeps challenging my  abilities frequently. If you look at the world of aviation, you can see two types of aircraft – civilian  ones like Boeing 787 and Airbus 350 and those built for warfare such as F 16, FA18,  Grippen, Typhoon, etc. The difference between these two classes is significant. Commercial aircraft are built with safety and stability in mind while the fighter  jets  are  built  for  maneuvering.  No  commercial  airplane  has  thrust  vectoring,  or  afterburner usage capabilities as these aircraft are supposed to transport passengers  safely across destinations. Therefore, it takes a while for the pilots to maneuver such  aircraft, and they cannot be easily pulled out of a sticky situation  they are sitting  ducks during landing and takeoff phases . Fighter aircraft are meant to chase, attack, and escape if required. They fly at various  altitudes and operate on the principles of physics that are not tested by commercial    The Secret Sauce      139  aviation aircraft. In the ET world, you need to retain the ability to be extremely  maneuverable, not just in terms of learning but also in terms of being prepared to  take on new roles and challenges. Which is why a role in ET is not for everyone.  Versatility is a need and not a luxury here. Versatility and adaptability are two features that you will have to prove during an  interview or once you join, and there is no denying this fact. Let us now look at some other aspects that you will need to get a role in this field. 10.3 JD is immaterial If you prepare for a role or an interview keeping just the JD in mind, the chances  are that you will find the going tough. I have come across many ET roles that didn't  even come with a JD. You will commonly see ads for developers, coders, analysts,  and more without any JD. Times  are  changing  in  the  past,  and  every  role  used  to  come  with  a  comprehensive JD. If the role were a  crucial one, it would have a JD no less  than a page in length with 10-15 bullet  points highlighting the responsibilities  and  outcomes.  These  days,  a  JD  hardly has a few points and doesn't go  beyond 300-500 words. In the world of  JD, many hiring managers keep the JD  open so that they get candidates who  can deliver way more than what a JD  demands of them. So, what does this mean for you? The  message is clear; even if you see a JD,  never make the mistake of seeing that  as a cage or a containment unit, which  limits the responsibilities of a role. A  JD  is  simply  a  guideline,  and  your  preparation  for  an  interview  should  address this challenge that is also an  opportunity at the same time.  In  their  book  Extreme  Ownership:  How  U.S.  Navy  SEALs  Lead  and  Win,  authors Jocko Willink, Leif Babin talk  about  the  concept  of  extreme  ownership.  Extreme  Ownership  involves  taking  full  responsibility  of  everything  that  you  do  and  whatever  happens  to  you.  They  go  on  to  say  that  the  best  leaders  out  there  don’t just take responsibility for their job  alone. Instead they take extreme ownership  of everything that impacts their mission.  This according to them is the fundamental  core  concept  enables  that  SEAL  team  leaders to lead high-performing teams in  extraordinary circumstances and win. In your career too, you should take extreme  no-holds barred ownership of every aspect  that impacts your career. Don’t let anyone  else control your destiny. That is how you  win.  Extreme ownership  A solution-minded approach that makes you think faster and offers solutions to  challenges and problems is what you need. If you look at any role in any ET field,  be it IoT, AI, cybersecurity or blockchain, you will see that businesses are trying to    140      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  diversify the scope of application of emerging tech so that they can exploit newer  market segments and diversify revenue and spread their operational and market  risks. In one of my earlier roles with an ET company, we were always looking at evolving  and proposing new use cases associated with IoT. One Monday morning, an analyst  with a Big 4 consultancy form came down to see us at our India HQ. He wanted some  use cases around the application of IoT in the banking sector. He insisted that he  needed the information, and in return, he will give us access to a few of his existing  clients who required an IoT platform or applications that we were selling those days. After checking with the product team, the sales engineering team, the road map team,  and a few others, I was not able to find satisfactory approaches for this need. So, as  the analyst left, I got down to business. Within a few hours, I could put together 5 use  cases by understanding the types of operational challenges that financial institutions  face and then linking that with solutions that could potentially be obtained from IoT. This is just one example of how you will have to apply yourself to shine in an ET  role. You will never be able to or should say that is not what I signed up for or my  JD didn't mention that. Instead, take up these challenges as a way of improving your  problem-solving skills and learning new things without paying for them. Yes, this  matters in ways that you cannot imagine. In the ET would you may have to step in for your CEO or someone in the C suite,  and unless you have been training for it by taking up random challenges that came  your way, you never be prepared or ready to take on such challenges and excel. In my ET career, I have seen everything, and since I have worked with traditional  companies as well, I can compare the two quickly and bring out differences between  the two. In an ET company, you will be able to learn way more, and you're learning  never  ends  because,  often,  you  will  always  be  on  the  frontlines  of  strategy  and  execution. So be prepared. 10.4 Living with unpredictability In all ET companies I have worked for, growth has never been on predictable lines.  There is always a very high level of uncertainty. Sales cycles are infinite; product  cycles  are  unstable,  even  employee  tenures  in  a  project  are  random.  Since  the  landscape is dominated by start-ups, in many cases, corporate decisions are often  based on funding priorities or decided by forces outside the boardroom. There is never a predictable moment in this segment. You will always have to figure  out  new  ways  to  deal  with  new  uncertainties.  Early  to  mid-stage  technologies  transform faster – both in terms of adoption and evolution. This is one aspect that  will  eventually  influence  everything  you  do  even  before  you  turn  up  for  your  interview. Flummoxed? Well, let me explain.   The Secret Sauce      141  Many a time, recruitment in the ET world happens in a very disorderly manner. It  has happened to me many a time, and it has happened often enough for me to see  a pattern here. Vacancies are canceled, interviews rescheduled, and vacancies may  sometimes stay open for months. Be ready for the long haul and act with patience and tact even if you face rejection,  the doors may not be closed yet. There have been many instances where candidates  have walked away from roles after they were selected, and the vacancy opened  again. You must sometimes wait for it, but while you wait, keep your options open.  Never make the mistake of putting all your vegetables in a single basket. We will talk about spreading the risk a bit later in this chapter. 10.5 Interview tactics One  of  the  start-ups  I  used  to  work  for  used  to  have  at  least  17-25  rounds  of  interviews.  This  company  was  very  particular  about  two  things.  Getting  people  who are willing and able and protecting their culture. They had a very supportive  culture where we used to watch out for each other and do things for our teammates  without blinking. Consequently, potential candidates had to prove they are capable  and understanding enough. Doing multiple rounds of interviews was one way of tiring the candidate down so  that they start revealing chinks in their armor but, more importantly, to weed out  candidates who were faking it. So, when you are presenting your candidature to an ET company, be mindful of this  fact. There will be a series of parameters on which you will be judged, so be ready  to prove yourself. The secret here is humility and a sense of readiness to accept  different expectations that the team may have from you. You may not be able to do  all of it, but you should be willing to and be prepared to live up to the expectations;  else, your tenure might be a truncated one. 10.6 Never fake anything I have come across many candidates who are willing to beat climate change during  the interview but are not even willing to turn off the lamps before they leave the  room after they are selected. People who promise the moon and fail to meet the bare  minimum expectations are the ones who hold up growth and, in some instances,  even slow down established companies. You should not be that candidate. There is  nothing wrong with promising if you are confident of your abilities and are willing  to go that extra mile to try hard to deliver on that promise. I have been through many interviews where I have made promises on responsibilities  that I knew less about at that time. But I did make this fact clear upfront to my    142      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  interviewers, and I have also told them how I intend to come up to speed faster.  Besides, those were the very aspects that I took up as soon as I got my offer letter  and started to work upon it. 10.7 Embrace diversity and learn to thrive  in it At different stages of growth, companies attract candidates with different skill sets,  motivations, and aspirations. Thus, it is easy to imagine that at any stage of your  candidature or tenure, you will be working with a motley crew of individuals with  diverse motivations. While it is why I am repeating myself here, learn to learn, and  do more than what your role calls for. By doing more, you learn, build dependencies,  and build a reputation. This may not always work for you, but it is the best favor you  can do on your future self:  Phase   On the  drawing board   Funding  Time frame Seed pre-seed 12 months to   month 0  Initial phase  Series A   Up to 18  months   Growth   Series B  12 months to 26  months   C and beyond Upwards of 26   months  Hypergrowth  stabilization;  usually marked  by the exit of  founders  Common traits of candidates    who apply  Motivated and able candidates who  may  or  may  not  be  from  premier  institutions  but  are  committed  to  and fully invested in the idea and  ready  to  handle  both  operational  and strategic aspects of the company  way beyond their role.   the  Same  as  above.  Though  candidate pool expands, some less  than motivated candidates also join  the workforce. The overall quality of the workforce  starts  experiencing  a  decline  as  more  of  status-quo  holders  join  from established businesses  The  workforce  is  now  dominated  by status quo champs. Most of the  initial workforce has moved out or  moved into other roles.  Table 10.1: Start-up stages and traits associated with candidates who apply   The Secret Sauce      143             10.8 Hit the ground running Learn  to  be  on  your  own  and  to  get  things  done  with  minimal  assistance  from  outside. I am not asking you to be someone who operates in a collaboration-free  silo here. All I am saying is that you need to learn how to minimize your chances of  disrupting others' schedules or slowing down their work. What is hitting the ground running?       Start early even before you get your offer letter. Plan your first 5 weeks in   detail with enough room for disruption.     Take up the deliverables before you join. You can always do your research;  figure out roadmaps or delivery schedules, key stakeholders, etc. before you  join.     Find out who can help you get started early and see how they can help you   before your first working day.     Understand the roadblocks and workarounds.    Never make the mistake of keeping your joining for the first day. Instead,  see which parts of the paperwork and other formalities can be completed  beforehand.     Finish any certifications or courses that will help you in your new role.    So, what happens on day one of your tenure then? On day one, you get access to  people, meetings, and confidential information essential for your role. In every other  aspect of work, you are already there. Think of it this way – you were working from  home all this while without a few collaboration tools and have now come to the  office. In almost all the places I have worked, I have hit the ground running. In one instance,  I was pulled out from an onboarding training session by my manager mid-way as  she wanted me to get started immediately. That move was something unprecedented  and saved me a lot of bother as the training sessions were sleepy at best, and even  with multiple cups of coffee, staying awake in the post-lunch session was akin to a  booster dose of sleeping drugs served to reluctant senses. The learning receptors in  the brain didn't even get a chance to process the information, and my sense just gave  up and repelled the information shared by our trainers. In the ET world, people who can hit the ground running have a clear advantage over  those who don't. It takes some effort to reach that level of thinking and execution, and  not everyone can do it. People often spend at least month learning, and their actual  role sometimes begins as late as a quarter after their joining date. You shouldn't be  the one who does this. If you can prove this, then you will be able to clear your interview faster.   144      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code 10.9 Get trained in data Managing data and your ability to make sense out of it will help you no matter  what you do. For both technical and functional roles, exposure to data management  is essential. These are the areas that you can do certifications courses or hands-on  work on:           Data analytics covering real-time and stored data    Data management techniques across platforms    Data-based  pricing,   technology-agnostic   product   service   and   recommendations     Forecasting techniques using basic data sets    Data visualization, graph analytics, and conversational AI are other aspects that will  help strengthen your pitch. Since all three are connected to customer experience and  your role will impact customer experience in some form or manner in the future,  you need to gain some exposure in these areas. This will also help you build a stable ground for a possible customer-facing role  shortly. Your capabilities around data management, impact analysis, relationship  analysis, and graph database management, and the use of a new stream of data  mesh approaches will go a long way in making you competitive in the job market  as well. 10.10 Leverage your network According to a recent survey, as many  as  75  percent  of  all  job  applications  come  via  online  channels.  LinkedIn  may  be  involved  here,  but  I  am  not  sure, and I will certainly not encourage  you to apply via them. It is one of the  most  flawed  job  search  channels  out  there. You should only treat it as a job  notice and not a portal for applying for  jobs. I am repeating this because this  is a fact that you need to work with.  Since LinkedIn often has 1000s of good  openings,  one  might  be  tempted  to  think that applying via them will help  you fetch the right role faster. The  only  way  in  which  LinkedIn  works,  however,  is  when  potential   Sherlock  Holmes,  Sir  Arthur  Ignatius  Conan  Doyle  most  famous  creation  is  known  equally  for  his  ability  to  draw  the  largest  of  conclusions  possible  from  the  smallest  of  observations  and  for  his  understanding  of  human  behavior  and  emotions.  Holmes  was  never  in  favor  of  sharing his secrets. His  reluctance  is  captured  in  a  now  famous  quote  of  his.

Now  going  back  to  the  old  statistic  that I quoted earlier, of the 75 percent  applications  online  channels,  40  percent  of  those  who  are hired come through an employee  referral.  This  is  a  very  conservative  number  as  the  actual  figure  may  be  as  high  as  80  percent,  according  to  recruiters, I know. So, your contacts do  manner. I  have  covered  some  aspects  related  to this topic in detail on how to find  the hidden jobs section. Beyond that,  keep  your  job  search  realistic  and  straightforward.  Sophisticated  multi- staged strategies with all kinds of dependencies come with more chances of failure.  You need to know what you are getting into, how to move fast towards your goal,  and measure each step on the way. Your network holds a powerful influence on the way your career shapes up. Beyond  job  opportunities,  your  network  could  also  connect  you  with  opportunities  for  positioning you as an influencer, bring you closer to decision-makers, and helps you  stay updated on the latest trends from your industry or tech and beyond. 10.11 Personal value proposition matters In  your  usual  interviews,  interviewers  often  ask,  tell  us  about  yourself,  and  then  pretend to listen while you ramble away imaging you are addressing an election  crowd that is crazy for you. In the world of ET, the interviewer will try and assess if  you can multi-task, work with fewer resources, be able to take on multiple functions,  be presentable to a prospect or a customer, and be able to design, market and sell a  product and work on your own with minimal guidance and supervision.  It is, therefore, no wonder that no one beats around the bush in an ET interview.  You are often asked pointed questions, given a whiteboard, and even asked to solve  puzzles the likes of which you wouldn't have seen or heard before.  Before  you  reach  the  interview  phase,  your  resume  is  scrutinized  for  the  value  proposition you can bring  onboard. These are some examples of a wrong value  proposition statement taken from real resumes out there:   146      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Great coder, can solve any algorithmic problems in a jiffy    Can sell anything to anyone, anywhere    Digital marketer having digital genes    Pre-sales champion with extensive presentation skills          Your  value  proposition  is  about  how  you  can  make  a  positive  and  if  possible  quantitative difference to the company or business you are going to join. Let  me  put  this  in  another  way.  Have  you  ever  stopped  to  ponder  why  your  prospective employer is not hiring you? The value proposition that goes into your  LinkedIn profile is different from the one that goes into your resume. The difference  is not too vast or immense, but it is still enough to be called out here. In your LinkedIn profile, you can bring in multiple aspects of your profile. Like for  instance: Technology sales leader with a USD 3.3 million revenue impact in 2019. In your resume, you will be a bit more specific: Technology sales leader with a 63 percent pipeline success and USD 3.3 million revenue  impact across Western and Central Europe in 2019. The clearer you are about your value proposition, the better are your chances of  having a good conversation during your interview, and it significantly boosts your  chances of getting hired. If your interviewer must figure out your value proposition,  the battle is already over. Unless you can pull out the proverbial rabbit from the  magical hat. But then only a few of us are magicians, right? I don't think I am one,  but are you? 10.12 Take care of your health This the most important item on your to-do list. Never take your health for granted.  When you are in your twenties and your body is in top gear, you start feeling that  your body will be like this forever with little effort. The truth is that unless you  condition your body and get it to do some serious work, it will start losing its sheen,  and slowly with every layer of fat that builds up, you will start inviting more lifestyle  diseases. A healthy mind resides in a healthy body and a healthy mind always pays attention  to its body. Exercise often. Exercising is our way of investing in keeping the body fit  for as long as you are on this planet. According to Canadian clinical psychologist and University of Toronto professor  of psychology, Jordan Bernt Peterson, the best way of preserving your IQ after you  cross your twenties is by exercising. This reduces the rate of decline by a significant  margin.   The Secret Sauce      147  10.13 Keep learning and unlearning No matter where you are in the job search cycle, keep learning. Go for short courses  and  certifications  to  the  extent  that  you  can.  It  is  advisable  to  do  one  essential  certification course in at least 6 months. In addition to certifications, see if you can try your hand at volunteering in projects  in your company related to various technologies. If you do get a chance, maximize  your exposure to these technologies and try and learn as much as you can. Don't  stop at learning; document your learning in a place where you can showcase it, such  as social media. Never say no to a new project that comes your way. Unless you are  convinced that it won't add value to your career or learning priorities. Conclusion There is no single path to anything significant that you see to achieve. You need to  continually challenge yourself and expand your frontiers in terms of knowledge,  learning,  execution,  and  ideation.  Every  step  that  you  take  to  challenge  your  capabilities will not just make you grow but also bring you closer to your goal. In short, that is the secret sauce to your transition to and success in the ET space. Question and answers 1.     Is there a simple secret tip that you can share that can tilt the balance in  favor of my candidature?    Ans. There is no single activity that you can undertake. Instead, you need to  focus on improving your value pitch, identifying ways in which you can do  multiple things for your new prospective employer, invest in improving your  skills through certification and voluntary work and last but not least, invest  in  expanding  your  ability  to  solve  problems. Always  remember  it  is  just  about how much you prepare, but it is also about how you can communicate  your preparation and readiness. Be confident, but not arrogant.   2.  How is an ET employer different when it comes to my interview?   Ans. I have covered this point before in previous chapters, but for the sake of  emphasis, let me answer this question again. For starters, ET employers are  looking for the following traits:    Problem-solving and project management    Adaptability    Ability to evolve new use cases and modify existing ones    Ability to see revenue from new short-term and long-term business models    Understand the significant of UI and UX in micro and macro detail                      148      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                                              Own parts of or whole of product development and market evaluation   and plan intervention strategies     Act as part of a team or individually    Delegation is a luxury in the world of ET The quest for these skills reflects in every aspect of your selection right from  the  JD  to  your  interview  and  onboarding  process.  These  skills  will  also  determine the altitude your tenure will attain once you join. One question  that  could  be  popping  up  in  your  mind  is,  how  are  these  requirements  different from those belonging to traditional roles in traditional companies  using traditional tech? Well, for starters, to reach the level of diversity of job  requirements that you encounter in an ET world in just 6 months, you will  need at least a decade in traditional companies  if you get a chance that is .  ET companies look at these aspects as minimum requirements, and you will  be using them in your day to day activities in an ET role whereas you may  not do so at all in a traditional company.  3.  Are these requirements different for companies that are based abroad?    Ans.  There  could  be  slight  variations  depending  on  the  culture.  Like  in  some countries, even if you are an excellent individual contributor and are  applying for an individual contributor role, you will still be required to prove  that you can work well in a team.  4.  Any suggestions for a Skype WebEx interview?   Ans. Treat it as a face-to-face interview and prepare accordingly. Other than   that, follow these tips:    Do not fidget around and appear restless thinking folks in the panel, or   your interviewer won't be able to see you.     Be dressed well.    Make sure your backdrop is clean and clutter-free; the area is well lit      The room should be free of distractions and noise.    Look at the interviewer in the eye whenever possible without appearing      Smile  often;  compliment  the  interviewer  when  they  ask  a  good   and comfortable.  threatening.  question.     Never fold your arms when you are responding to a question.    Don't get too comfortable.    Keep a pen and paper handy and, if required, use it as an aid to do any  calculations or to help in any answer. You can even make a note of any  points that you wish to. But you should always tell your interviewer  that you are doing so.   Becoming a Thought Leader      149  Chapter 11 Becoming a  Thought  Leader  Introduction According to bestselling author and AL Gore's former speechwriter, Daniel Pink,  like it or not, we're all in sales now. This statement summarizes a reality that we are all  part of consciously or otherwise. We wear our sales hats more often than we realize.  When we are negotiating or simply presenting ourselves as a leader or an expert in  some context, we are playing the role of salesperson. A good salesperson should know his tools and his environment well. In a world  where ideas are the most exchanged and sought-after currency, a good salesperson  should also be rich in ideas and be an expert in understanding the means to share  them. By being exceptionally good at connecting ideas and people, some of us gain  the  power  of  influence.  Such  people  turn  into  custodians  of  wisdom  and  guide  companies, industries, and help governments and people understand and address a  challenge or in some instances break down a trend or a technology in such a manner  that is easy to relate. Such people are called thought leaders. Some people think thought leaders are simply good presenters, subject matter experts,  or communicators. That is the wrong way of characterizing these people who lead  by ideas and imagination. Instead thought leaders are essential for the adoption and  evolution of technologies and to foster collaboration among fragmented technology  eco-systems.   150      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  It is important to have thought leaders. But it is even more important to evolve into  one. Structure In this chapter, we will learn how you can evolve into a visible and vocal subject  matter expert AKA thought leader faster. This chapter is about:       Understanding the definition of a thought leader and why is becoming one   important     Understand what it takes to be a thought leader in the industry    Work towards becoming one with the right inputs    Learn about the different paths to thought leadership     Understanding the journey of a thought leader    Learning how to channel knowledge    Understanding the different aspects of leadership by ideas    Leveraging opportunities to evolve faster    The things to do to hasten your journey to becoming a thought leader            Objective       11.1 Who is a thought leader? So, who exactly is a thought leader? A thought leader is someone who leads through  ideas that hold an informed opinion s  on a subject and are considered as the go-to- people in their field of expertise. I have been fortunate to have worked with many  thought leaders who have helped me grow in my personal and professional life.  These were the people who I could look up to, reach out to for ideas and solutions,  and  who  were  able  to  make  me  think  and  use  a  multi-disciplinary  approach  to  solving a problem. Businesses and individuals can be thought leaders. This chapter is about individuals,  though. 11.2 The definition Thought leaders, through their understanding, knowledge, and opinions, influence  industries and evolution of technologies, workflows, best practices by offering ideas,  interventions, conceptual or actual solutions, and lead by ideas. Thought leadership  is essential, and it gives an individual or even a business a certain level of authority,    Becoming a Thought Leader      151  makes them stand out as experts, and helps others gain expertise and knowledge  required to grow an industry or a market. What are the traits of a thought leader?         Deep subject matter expertise in one technology or multiple technologies.    Ability  to  understand  trends  and  response  strategies  to  contain  or  profit   from, or learn from a trend or trends.          They can articulate a problem statement and offer solutions with equal ease.    Cut  through  the  clutter  of  noise  created  by  media analysts industry  participants  or  others  to  offer  clarity  of  thoughts,  ideas,  solutions,  or  a  mixture of these.     Can see things that others miss or are too busy to notice.    They can rise above affiliations to offer a unique perspective.      Thought leaders have been around since ancient times. Wikipedia lists the famous  Roman statesman, lawyer, and Academic Skeptic philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero  as the most famous ancient thought leader. But we do know that priests and advisors  to kings were among the most prominent thought leaders in ancient times. Not only  were these people known for their knowledge, but they also held a sturdy grip on  the  administration  of  the  rulers  they  were  connected  to.  Their  advice  was  often  considered as the last say on several matters. In ancient times, the mantle of thought leadership was earned, and it was not an  easy  one  to  gain,  unlike  today.  Thought  leaders  were  respected  and  celebrated,  and they were held as icons to emulate. Philosophers Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates,  Indian political strategist Chanakya, Copernicus, Aryabhata, Pythagoras, Brahmagupta,  Vārāhamihira, and Bhaskara II, Al-Khwarizmiand Pythagoras are all examples of thought  leaders who influenced the world significantly and continue to do so long after they  left the planet. 11.3 Most misused title In today's times, you will see people calling themselves thought leaders after giving  a couple of speeches to a sponsored audience.  I knew a colleague long ago who used  to use the word casually calling herself a thought leader, a speech leader  whatever  that means , and a technology soothsayer. Frankly, I have no clue what all these add  up to. Off late, people have started using the title very loosely without paying any  attention to its implications or what it means for the person claiming to be one. Being a thought leader is a privilege and a responsibility, which is why it doesn't  come easily to those who wish to be one. Some evolve into one, and a majority doesn't  become one. So is being a thought leader all about speaking and writing articles  or being visible? The answer is a definite NO. While those things are symptoms,    152      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  becoming a thought leader involves some levels of transformation, and these are the  aspects of your professional and personal life that get affected:           Levels of knowledge.    Looking at an issue or a problem outside its immediate context.    Your ability to arrange assimilated information, analyzes it in your mind,   and is the products of your thinking based on a specific need.     Your storytelling abilities.    Your ability to seek non-conventional solutions or even simple solutions to a        problem.     Sometimes you can even detect problems before they turn apparent.    As with all other good things in life, there are no shortcuts to becoming a thought  leader.  You  have  to  preserve,  introspect,  investigate,  read,  comprehend,  learn,  unlearn, and understand. This is why you don't see anyone offering a certificate  course in thought leadership. 11.4 Why is it important? Before we dive deeper, it is essential to understand why being a thought leader or  even aspiring to be one is essential. Why is it that some of us aspire to be one while  many of us don't want to be one? Why is it that many of us are merely interested  in it as they feel that it can lead to them being able to command a premium in the  job market in terms of salary and a position? For those who don't understand the  concept, it is all about transactional and operational benefits, and that is certainly not  a reason why I am encouraging you to become a thought leader. Take a look at this pyramid.   Figure 11.1: Professional achievement ladder   Becoming a Thought Leader      153          The highest level of achievement for a professional is thought leadership  I am not  taking into account position, salary, etc., for obvious reasons . The journey towards  thought  leadership  begins  with  being  part  of  the  masses  and  then  gradually  evolving as we rise and grow in our career. One question that I keep getting asked  is whether we can become thought leaders naturally by spending say 2 decades in  an organization or working on a specific technology. The simple answer is Yes. But  again, this is not a necessity. One can spend years together doing the same thing  without becoming one. Your journey of evolution, rising from being a commoner, decides to a large extent  your altitude, and your trajectory decides how far you land. So why don't most of us  end up becoming a thought leader?       Some of us are simply not ambitious enough. We get happy once we move  into  a  leadership  position  and  then  continue  doing  repeated  chores  or  managing large teams     Some of us never care enough to invest enough time in sharing our learning   with the masses outside our organization    Few of us are merely ignorant or don't care    Some of us don't gather enough momentum during various stages of our   career to propel us into the thought leadership orbit     Gravity    Did you say gravity? What's that? Gravity includes all those factors that peg you  down. These are the forces, including procrastination, settling in the comfort zone,  lack of agility or motivation, and much more that slows down your evolution to  levels that prevent you from turning into a thought leader. Gravity affects us when we are in the 4-10 years bracket in our career. Its effects are  long-lasting and often irreversible. 11.5 Strategy To evolve into a thought leader, you need to keep trying at multiple levels. Here are  a few areas that you have worked on in parallel. 11.5.1 Learn This is one of the core requirements. To build the confidence necessary to express  your ideas and engage others, you need to have a knowledge base to rely on. This  knowledge base has to be updated periodically with learnings not just of your own  but those of others as well. You need to be a good listener and open to new ideas and  thoughts. You may not always have the answers, but you can always have the clues  or even the answers come from someone else. There is no harm in admitting that you  don't know something.   154      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Learning involves formal and non-formal methods. In case you are unable to learn  enough from your job or your colleagues or through events or webinars, get yourself  registered in some course offered by a reputed institution. These days, thanks to  the proliferation of online learning courses, you can access material from premier  schools such as Harvard and Stanford right from your home. Don't stop at just attending these courses and getting a certificate. Start applying  what you learn in what you do and start sharing that information with those around  you. In case you are unable to apply what you learn in your job, start writing about  it or prepare presentations. Both these options help you chew on ideas and take your  learning forward. 11.5.2 Disrupt Yes, that is the best way to pull yourself out of your comfort zone. Such zones are  like traps once you are caught in one, it takes some level of energy and motivation  to pull yourself out. Comfort zones are like black holes. The power of gravity that  resides in them can hold you, prisoner, for the rest of your career. What is the best way to break free? Well, go after mistakes. Yes, you have heard it  right. Chase mistakes by doing new things. That way, you will expose yourself to  new challenges and ideas and new ways to fail to push your levels of understanding  further while helping you evolve. You will be forced to seek answers, think outside  the box, and do things you have never done before. It is, therefore, the best way of  pulling you out of the quicksand of your comfort zone. You will learn to evolve, or you will perish. It is a binary, always remember that. 11.5.3 Create Thought leaders are creators. They are not just good at articulating their views orally;  they can also pen their thoughts when needed. This is a mandatory requirement.  What you say and what you write reaches places you cannot physically go to and  creates recall equity and credibility for you. It is the single most significant factor  that can propel you to a thought leadership orbit. I often hear people say, I cannot write to save my life or I have stage fright. The fear of  being seen or heard in a public platform frightens the daylights out of people. Is it  a tough thing to do? Yes. But is it impossible? The answer is an obvious no. With  practice, you will develop into an excellent speaker and a writer, but remember that  you must sacrifice your fears for it. Value cannot be created out of thin air. Instead, it must be built on a pre-existing  foundation. This is why thought leaders spend their free time reading, listening to  people, and introspection. I have said this before, and I am repeating. There is no one    Becoming a Thought Leader      155  thing you can do that can change your life more than reading. Reading helps you  connect with someone else thoughts, think, write better, build your imagination, and  multi-dimensional thinking and the best part is that it helps you take a problem out  of its immediate context to help you find a unique solution. Creating value for others will bring forth a qualitative difference in your life, so it is  worth the entire grind that you will go through. How do I start? Well, to begin with, create a blog and start posting your thoughts  there. A blog post gives you sufficient anonymity to post your thoughts without  attracting enough negative attention that could derail your initial enthusiasm. Once  you gain confidence or traction, start moving your posts to a more visible platform  like LinkedIn or do short videos on YouTube. When it comes to speaking, there is only one way of doing it right. Grab every  available opportunity to improve your ability to communicate. I went through a  phase in my life where I was low on confidence and used to stammer, lose my train  of thoughts, and used to end up making silly mistakes on stage. To  regain  my  confidence,  I  reached  out  to  the  Human  Resources  team  in  my  organization, which was very helpful in giving me a slot in the onboarding process  to speak to new joiners.  It gave me a chance to get my mojo back, and I didn't look  back ever since. I have never shied away from a public speaking opportunity now,  no matter the situation. I have spoken while being jet-lagged, dehydrated, with 10  mins of lead time, and sometimes in worse situations. I love public speaking, and it has, over the years, helped me cultivate a series of habits  such as focused research, subtle and crisp speaking, building elevator pitches, and  more. I have also learned how to notice signs of audience disconnect and disinterest  to make on the spot changes to my talk to evince more interest. It is a privilege to speak in front of an audience, and you need to treat it as such.  Books The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs and Talk like TED both by Carmine Gallo  are heavily recommended if you wish to improve your speaking and presentation  skills. You will have to work hard to deploy the recommendations made by the  author in both these books. Other ways to be creative that are more than worthwhile:           I have been asked so many times if it is easy to write a book. I have always told them  it is not. You have to have focus, dedication, and commitment to the topic. In fact,      Write a book    Get articles published in the media    Contribute to independent blogs    Start a YouTube channel    Start a podcast channel   156      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  in some instances, deciding on the topic itself is a long drawn process. But once you  are willing to put in the effort, you will find the going way easier than you imagined. I wrote my first book in 90 days. I took it up as a project from start to finish giving  myself strict timelines. I quarantined myself  before it became mandatory, thanks to  the outbreak of Coronavirus  and focused on finishing the book before the idea, and  the sequence of thoughts slipped by, and I was glad I didn't give in to anything that  could create a distraction then. The best way to build a brand for yourself is to get published in authority publications.  Once you have a book in your portfolio, tons of opportunities including speaking  opportunities and queries from media outlets open-up. This puts you in a different  league altogether. All these efforts will not just help you become more creative but will also bring in  credibility and help you understand your subject much better. In the world of ET,  this will also help you connect with various topics and build subject matter expertise. 11.5.4 Narrow down – find a niche Just like you found a niche technology to be part of, find a topic that you can be a  thought leader in. This will help you focus and apply your attention to a specific area  rather than getting lost in the sea of topics that are out there. It is always advisable to  take up something that others are not willing to or hesitant to tackle. Work backward from a position of leadership to see how you can reach there. 11.5.5 Challenge yourself Put forth your ideas and theories in smaller groups around you like your teammates  and colleagues or those from your alma mater and let them challenge you. In the  initial  stages,  you  will  encounter  some  resistance  in  the  beginning,  but  as  time  goes by and you get more confident and insightful, your ideas will meet with less  resistance, and people might start looking at you for guidance and ideas. If you continue doing this, you can gradually expand your sphere of influence till it  encompasses the industry or even beyond. 11.5.6 Focus on offering solutions Be a voice that projects a sense of calm during a calamity. When things are going  well, focus on providing solutions to existing problems and those are yet to come. It  is good to discuss problems in a forum where they are people who can be inspired  or nudged to help solve it. But if you are reaching out to an audience where there are  no such folks, it is advisable to talk about solutions or a problem-solving approach.   Becoming a Thought Leader      157  Offering solution takes your credibility to a new high, which brings me to another  point. Always remember to customize your messaging to the needs of the audience  you are engaging in. Now, this might sound like a no-brainer, but I have seen so  many thought leaders give the same speech to multiple audiences at various times  without even thinking about the audience. Sometimes, you may have to do this, but  turning it into a habit is not a good thing to do. Know your network and those you are connecting to. Never assume the preferences  of your audience. Even on LinkedIn, try to ask your network what they like to see or  hear from you. It is a recommended best practice. 11.5.7 Be visible Be active on social media channels, blogs, and try to do at least one speaking gig a  quarter. Prepare and share a steady stream of content across Twitter and LinkedIn  and be seen and heard in industry forums and webinars. This will not just bring  you more speaking opportunities but will also help you expand your network and  connect you will new audiences and opportunities for the future. I have also seen thought leaders use public events to find new problems to solve and  link up with potential collaborators and consulting opportunities. 11.5.8 Seek out consulting opportunities Thought leaders are often engaged in multiple activities within and outside their  immediate area of expertise. Consulting opportunities can include:         Offering advice on projects.    Being part of panels established by government bodies to work on policy   matters.     Being part of focus groups established by industry bodies.    Being part of an industry-academia alliance body.    Any other part-time project.        11.5.9 Teach During the early days of my career, I accompanied my boss, who was a part-time  faculty in a regional B-school, for a session he was taking on communication. The  whole exercise was an eye-opener, and even though I was just helping him in a  task that he had worked out for the students for that day, I could see the power of  teaching up close. Many seasons have passed since, and today whenever I step up on the podium to  address students, I remember that day vividly. Teaching is the best way to learn.    158      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Teaching is a stage of learning. There is something magical about standing in front  of a bunch of enthusiastic students or even professionals and sharing your thoughts  and ideas. You cannot teach unless you have a certain degree of authority on the subject and  are willing to expand your thought horizon and learn. Sharing your knowledge only  makes it grow, and you never know who you are inspiring while you are teaching. You  needn't  always  be  a  part-time  faculty  or  even  a  visiting  professor. You  can  instead take sessions whenever the university or college invites you – even if it is  once a year or less. The idea is to engage an audience that is eager to learn and then  identify gaps in your learning by answering questions from them. 11.5.10 Find the gap There  is  always  an  information  gap  out  there  in  the  industry.  Knowledge  is  a  powerful weapon and the ones who have it and can express it can wield it to gain  a competitive edge in the industry. Despite knowing the value of knowledge that is  gathered internally, many companies rely on analyst firms to give them the numbers  and the data. This, in my opinion, is not the right way of doing it. In one of my earlier ET companies, we had analyst firms come to us to provide them  use cases and solution approaches. We were able to exchange that to get them to  bring us opportunities. That's a win-win situation. In our professional lives too, we  can turn into conduits for knowledge to carve a niche for ourselves. In the ET world,  use cases, trends, challenges at the ground level, and fears stemming from misuse  are all hot topics for the media and industry to discuss. So, if you can pack these  neatly into a perspective, you have got it made. That is where the information gap is  and that is the knowledge chasm that you need to fill. While you are addressing this gap, make sure you send a signal through the noise  that doesn't add to the noise. There are plenty of people out there who are trying to  use these gaps to spread half-baked knowledge, and you should not be among them.  Instead, focus on providing a studied perspective that can stand a session of intense  academic scrutiny and is original. Those who complicate technology focus on the short term while those who speak  about it in a relatable manner are the ones who outlast the former. Look at popular  physists like Sean Carol or a paleontologist like Mary Schweitzer. They have emerged  into thought leaders because they can articulate fascinating theories in a manner that  is easy to understand and doesn't sound patronizing. These are the people you need  to look up to.   Becoming a Thought Leader      159  11.5.11 Ask yourself who you are? The journey to becoming a thought leader is never complete without knowing your  true self. Howard Behar, author of It's Not About the Coffee and the former President of  Starbucks who grew the company from 28 stores to more than 15,000 once worked  at a furniture company. He was just 26 when his boss walked in one day and asked  him what he loved more people or furniture? That question led him to re-think his priorities in life. Up until that point, Behar  wanted to be the best in his industry. But after some thinking, he realized that he  loved people more than furniture. The question of who am I has been always on his  mind, Behar said in multiple interviews. Unless you know who you truly are, you will not be able to find out who you could  be. So invest some time in finding out your answer to this question. A thought leader  must guide not just individuals but also industry and in some cases a nation or a  movement. The thought leadership journey begins with understanding who you  are. Become self-reliant The  essence  of  what  is  called  the  Harada  Method,  a  management  technique  designed to create and promote a new people-centric organizational culture is “self- reliance.” Self-reliance relates to the ability of every individual to become highly  skilled in some discipline. Self-reliant people make decisions for themselves and  their organizations. At the core of the Harada Method is a simple task requiring  people to choose a strong goal that they can relate to, excites them, and inspires them  to succeed. It also requires people to express their purpose s , the traits they value, and identify  a goal that helps attain those purposes while identifying, analyzing, and working on  their strengths and weaknesses. All this is done with the help of a coach if required.  The best part of this method is that it pushes individuals to take responsibility for  their actions and in defining a path to success that is of their own making. Get inspired by competition In a world where competition is seen as an entity to beat, learn to see things differently.  Thought leaders know how to work with, workaround, and even collaborate with  the competition. It gives you a reason to improve your game. Many of us view  competition as a perennial albatross hanging around our necks. But it does take  some effort to see them as sources of inspiration. Here are a few ways you can try:       See if you can collaborate with competition in a new area where you both can   benefit from each other.   160      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code             Study the methods deployed by competition and see if you can change a  strategy or tactic in the process. If you can learn something from what they  are doing well.     Learn humility from them. It doesn't pay to be arrogant.    Competition provides is a perennial source for innovation. If you study their  approach well, you will know the gaps that are there in their strategy and  use that to your advantage.  The perils of copying  In the year 2001, China purchased a Sukhoi-33 prototype from Ukraine and  reverse engineered it to build a fighter jet of its own called the Shenyang J-15.  The result was a heavy fighter  weighing nearly 17.5 tones without weapons   with underdeveloped engines that kept on crashing and could not perform  its primary role as an aircraft carrier-based fighter jet effectively. China had to  spend money and time to fix these flaws and today it claims to have a stable  jet that can conduct its duties well.  The development of this modified jet has come at a huge cost. One cannot  but help wonder if China had invested the amount of money and time in  developing its own fighter jet would that have been more successful? Well I  will let you be the judge. 11.5.12 Build relationships and learn to give Humility is an underrated trait in the corporate sphere. Being humble makes you  learn better and bring you more opportunities than you can imagine. When it comes  to networking and building relationships don't ever make the mistake of building  networks to receive and only receive. Networking is more about giving than receiving. It is not wrong to expect your  network to support you and nurture your ambitions, but then, it is wrong to have  that as the only objective for you to build or expand your network. Collaboration could be another way of leveraging your network. This is especially  true when it comes to working with people who are doing similar work. This also  helps you expand your work, and you never where your work will take you to. This  one-way start-up is born. 11.5.13 Perspective matters Is it essential to hold a different perspective to be a thought leader? No, I know of  thought leaders who reinforce the normal in their way. The difference is in how  they present what is already known and understood. The secret lies in the way they    Becoming a Thought Leader      161  package  the  information  to  make  their  audience  see  and  think  about  something  similar in a different way. Thought leaders in the ET space are cut from a slightly different cloth. Because there  are so many projects happening and so much learning going around, the number of  thought leaders is lesser than what I would call an ideal level. This means that many  leaders are not talking about what they are doing for various reasons, and this leads  to a vacuum being created that is rarely addressed. Therefore, we need more people to come forth and share more often. There is plenty  of scope for collaboration and the exchange of best practices. Things to do:                   Move away from the fear of being judged.    Be yourself. Pretention is for the weak.    What can I do to help? That's a question you should often ask.    Give yourself enough room to make and recover from mistakes.    Be kind, honest, and open in all your interactions.    Live up to trust and never take other people's attention or time for granted.    Learn is useless if it is not used and shared. So learn to share in whatever         Use fear to challenge the limits you have set on yourself. That is the best way   little way you can.  to grow.     Doing more without a plan is a recipe for failure.    Conclusion In conclusion, these are just a few things I could think of when it comes to taking  practical steps towards becoming a thought leader. In addition to these steps, it is  essential to always look at what you do from the perspective of someone who could  be interested in it. That will be your audience in the future. Someone out there will  be interested in what you do. Finally, stay passionate and convey that sense of passion. Nothing beats passion  when it comes to succeeding in the ET world, and we need people who can inspire  others. Questions and answers 1.  Why is it essential to be a thought leader?     Ans. It is a matter of choice. And as I have mentioned earlier, it is a logical    extension of everything you do, and it is an evolutionary milestone for you    162      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  as a professional. A thought leader plays a significant role in influencing the  direction the industry is taking vis-à-vis a technology, business outcome, or  resolution of challenges or any other matter. It gives you access to platforms  from where you can voice and share your learnings and opinions for the  greater common good of the industry. If you aspire to be a thought leader, then it also makes you push your abilities  and do a lot more to structure your career and work. It lends efficiency and  momentum to your professional journey and puts you in a separate league.     2.  Will it drain me out? I just want to focus on my career.   Ans. It will place some added strain on you, but then as I said, it is about  taking your learnings to the next logical level. It doesn't take your ability to  focus on your career. Instead, the pursuit of becoming a thought leader will  help you learn new things and rise faster in your career if you do it the right  way.   3.  What is the right way?     Continue doing everything you need to succeed in your role.    Look for new opportunities to learn and collaborate outside your job   role and responsibilities.     Look  at  ways  in  which  you  can  showcase  your  learnings  and   perspectives to different audiences.     Document and publish your learning.  4.  Any pitfalls or points to watch out for?     Build trust; trust is the fundamental requirement for credibility.    Never share confidential information when talking or writing.    Thought  leadership  isn't  about  getting  paid  for  speaking  or  for      Never put someone or your competitor down to make you appear as a   endorsements.  thought leader.                                    Measuring Success and Making Course Corrections      163  Chapter 12 Measuring  Success and  Making Course  Corrections  Introduction Three things are essential in a journey the destination, the journey itself, and the  first step. Well, that's what they say. In our books, we will define the journey using  a slightly different way. Now don't get me wrong these three aspects are important  but what is more important is to ensure that you know you are moving and moving  in the right direction. Thus, it is essential to measure and deploy corrections when  needed. As I have said before, sending the same job application to 50 places and assuming  you are working hard to get a new job is not the way to work. Instead, applying to  5 places with highly tailored applications and a well-researched covering letter will  bring you closer to your goal. Unless you measure movement, effort, and progress,  you will never come to know if you are headed in the right direction. Structure This chapter is about:           Setting the right benchmarks    Understanding the difference between progress and accomplishing tasks    Measuring your momentum and progress   164      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Learning what to do if you are not moving fast enough    Persevering, when things are not going well    Staying aware of how your career is progressing        Objective By the end of this chapter, you should be able to      Measure your career progress      Break free from illusions of progress      Figure out ways to improve your momentum 12.1 The illusion of progress  Actions that lead to a career lag  If  you  identify  with  3  or  more  of  these  actions, you will run into hurdles soon:      Not networking enough      Not preparing enough for interviews      Not  showing  enough  focus  on  the   future  you are myopic        Not investing time in research      Not investing in yourself      Equating work with career      Not confident enough      Acting  in  an  unprofessional  manner   on social media      Misusing time      Pretending to be busy, always      Rude to co-workers  Before  I  began  pursuing  a  career  in  the  ET  World  in  a  more  structured  manner, my methods were not aligned  to  anything  that  could  have  gotten  me anywhere close to a role in an ET  company.  I  was  applying  nearly  11  times a day across LinkedIn and other  job portals. I was using standard cover  letters with a few modifications, and  with each application, I was closer to  my goal. The  ground  truth,  however,  was  something  else.  I  was  miles  away  from  anything  remotely  resembling  success, and because I did not measure  my  activities,  I  could  see  that  I  was  simply doing tasks for the sake of it.  Within  a  month,  the  whole  process  became repetitive and cumbersome. I  had applied to almost 90 companies,  including  start-ups,  but  I  was  not  going  beyond  getting  an  auto-reply  from them.  Instead of getting bogged down, I decided to see where I am going wrong, and I  could jot down a few points without even having to think much:   I was not selective about the companies I was applying to I was not paying attention to the job description or the company profile            Measuring Success and Making Course Corrections      165               I was not doing enough research I was not preparing enough for each application           My focus was on applying to as many companies as possible     I was using LinkedIn, a platform that doesn't help if you are applying for a  job I didn't have a day to day plan    I  was  still  getting  into  interview  calls,  but  things  weren't  moving.  I  was  also  applying to places that were just indulging in market surfing without being serious  about hiring a candidate. There was at least one start-up at this stage that was also  ‘cheating' candidates by giving them projects to do to get ideas, collate their work,  and make a fortune out of it.  Yes, there are such people out there, and you should  be careful about them. The illusion of progress is a paralyzing one. It makes you think that you are moving  ahead while you are rooted to the ground. Without having access to tracking data  gathered on a day-to-day basis, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to know if you  are even moving, let alone in the right direction. And this is a common mistake that  many of us commit. Sometimes out of compulsion  as in lack of time , sometimes  due to sheer laziness and sometimes because we are not ready to listen or introspect.  So don't fall for these self-induced hallucinatory procrastination drivers. Instead,  keep measuring your progress to ensure that you are moving and moving in the  right direction. Does the measurement end once you get a job you wanted? The answer is no. What  if?         12.2 Pre-launch assessments Before you set goals for yourself, you need to build clarity on these aspects:       You are not happy in the new role?    You are not able to fully express yourself here?    There is a vast gap between what was promised vs. What did you get?    Things are not moving as fast as you thought it would?     What your KPIs will signify: what will your KPIs translate into? What will  be the focus areas for your KPIs, and how would you align it to your overall  career vision?     What will be measured, and how?    Are these KPIs realistic?    How many metrics can you measure, and how frequently can you measure          them?   166      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                 Know  what  success   looks  like and define it as clearly as  possible     What activities would indicate  cheating  and  moral ethical  compromise?     Can   someone  help  me   measure my growth? If so, what would that person  be responsible for?      Cause and effect  The disease malaria has been attributed to  many causes. Hippocrates, the Father of  Medicine attributed malaria to ingestion  of  stagnant  water.  The  Greek  fable  of  Hercules  and  Hydra  is  believed  to  have  its origin in the belief that the evil spirits  or malarial gods used to reside within the  marshes. Today we know how this disease  is  spread  because  we  have  established  a  clear link between the disease, the vector  and the parasite. Even if one of these is not  found,  the  chances  of  people  attributing  the  disease  to  an  evil  spirit  or  a  swamp  dwelling monstrosity is high. Thus is it essential to establish a clear link  between cause and effect so that you don’t  jump  into  the  wrong  conclusions  and  worse, take the wrong steps.  Too  often,  people  focus  on  certain  parts of the journey that they do well  because that is the most natural part.  We all had our favorite subjects when  we  were  kids.  Some  of  us  used  to  focus on them because we used to get  good marks in them or had a favorite  teacher who taught it. Some of us also  had a few subjects at the same that we  used to avoid altogether. Education is  about attaining a balance between the two to know where you need to focus your  attention on. There is a theory that recommends starting your day with the worst item on your  list. You can use that as a guide, or you can try something else that you feel might  work. But no matter what you do, make sure that you invest your efforts across all  activities so that you attain the right balance of momentum and, more importantly,  don't have anything slow you down. 12.3 The benchmarks and measurement 12.3.1 During the application phase This is the phase where you need visibility into your rate of growth and do course  corrections  faster.  Thus,  we  need  to  have  the  maximum  number  of  KPIs  here.  Here are some of the recommended KPIs for measuring your journey through the  application phase:   Factor  Best case  Meeting   Measuring Success and Making Course Corrections      167  The   outcome is  less than  satisfactory  Saw the  ad on a job  portal  3  marks   Need  help  What went  well  wrong  Note the  rationale for  scoring here  Saw  the  ad on  Link  edIn   2   Saw the  ad on the  website  of the  company   4 marks   Heard it  from a  person  in my  network  who  informed  me  5  marks       How did I hear about this  role and how credible was  the channel.

Cumulative score   of    85   85   85   85  Table 12.1: KPIs for measuring your progress during the application phase  12.4 Using the table Start  from  the  first  question,  move  horizontally,  and  write  down  your  response  the way I have done for the first parameter. In this case, I have given 4 options  simultaneously, which will never be the case. You will have one or at the most 2  responses for each parameter. Use the last column to give the reasoning for the assigned score. This is to ensure that  you don't give an arbitrary response, which will defeat the purpose of the exercise. Finally,  add  up  the  scores  and  let  that  number  sit  in  the  numerator  while  the  maximum possible score sits at the denominator. You can compare the scores in each  column to understand the situation. If your first column gets the maximum marks,  you are doing it right. Else, you need help. I have not filled up the other columns as you need to work on understanding the  importance of the responses for each of the columns. Take up the exercise and give  it adequate attention and diligence. This will make a qualitative difference to your  application and the whole process of job search. The more diligent and attentive you  are, the more successful you will be. So have faith in the process and give it your  best shot.  Tip: Get someone to help you review every step of the process so that you  get an objective view of the situation.   Measuring Success and Making Course Corrections      169  Else there is a scope for some complex bias to emerge. A document created by me  shouldn't be reviewed by me. A similar logic applies here. These are broad areas that I have identified for you. You can go deeper into each  aspect  or even added new parameters  and figure out some more questions and rate  yourself against each question under the respective columns. Be truthful to yourself  and committed to the exercise. Once you start doing this as a routine, you will start  getting more ideas on making your application stand out and do a more thorough  job. Now let's look at some more KPIs that you can use at an advanced stage within the  application phase provided in Table 12.2:  Factor  Best  case   Meeting  standards  Need  help  What went  well  wrong  The   outcome is  less than  satisfactory   Days took to receive a  response to the application Quality of response  received from the company Reason for rejection  possible reason for selection  for the interview  Was there an explanatory  rejection mail? Is the vacancy still posted  on their website the portal  you saw it on? Do you have any contacts in  the organization?  Table 12.2: Measuring the success of your application during the advanced stages  Essential pre-to do list:           Be as objective as you can.    See things from the perspective of a third-party.     If needed, get someone else to measure you  but the questions should mostly  be yours .     You have a considerable stake in the outcome of this exercise, so make sure   you give it your best shot.     Keep some time aside in your daily schedule for this activity.    A coach or mentor can help at this stage.           170      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Now, some of you may ask how is the first question  days took to receive a response   relevant? The answer is simple. In some cases, if you have taken time out to tailor  your resume, write a compelling and personalized covering letter and even reached  out to the person who has posted the role, you could receive a response other than  the automated lifeless mails that most of receive once we drop an application. Similarly, for all questions, look at the spirit of the question rather than the words.  Every single question in the table is there for a reason. It reveals a part of the jigsaw  puzzle and gives you answers that help you understand what you are doing right  and where you need to focus your attention on. These questions will also give your  ideas on how to improve the tasks associated with each question. Should I give you similar tables for each of the processes from here on? I feel you can  take it from here. Ah, well, let me do some of it for you anyway so that you can focus  on improving the tables and getting better results out of the exercise. Let's take a breather before moving forward. A few years ago, I used to work for  an organization where we used to conduct a BRAG  Blue, Red Amber, and Green   session  once  every  month.  So  there  was  a  team  level  BRAG  dashboard  and  an  organizational one. So every team had to call out the status of key processes and color them using one  of these colors  BRAG  to indicate the health of that process. Suppose everything  was going well with that task, the project was active and on track, it was ranked  marked Green. There were different views as well, such as a business view, resource  view, etc. If the task was on hold because of some issues, it was marked blue. If the task was  active but was moving forward with some concerns, it was marked, Amber. Finally,  if the task was stuck without any movement due to a variety of factors and needed  immediate corrective action, it was marked Red. To make matters complex, shades were to be used to indicate the status of each task. Every session that we used to have was insightful, yet we used to find some humor  in some of the aspects. Here are a few notable ones:       Two teams working on different parts of the same task used to show the task  using different colors at the organizational level because of differences in  perception.     Resource view for every task was often shown in Red by all teams as everyone  wanted to show they needed more resources  so the CEO asked us to mark  all resource views as green as this according to him was a problem for all of  us and we, according to him, needed to learn how to get the work done with  minimal resources .     Because of some issues with the projector, some shades wouldn't be visible,         and this created more confusion.   Measuring Success and Making Course Corrections      171  Though the sessions were useful in terms of helping different teams communicate,  it  didn't  help  the  CEO  do  much  as  he  realized  later  that  people  were  assigning  colors based on their perception, and that was hurting the objectivity of the whole  exercise. This just goes to show how even the best exercises could suffer from the  bias attributable to perception. So, make sure that you don't let your perception come in between you and your  goal. Keep the exercise objective. The next set of KPIs relates to the interview and job offer phase. The same rules as  above apply here as well:  Factor  Best case  Meeting  standards  Need  help  What went  well  wrong  The   outcome is  less than  satisfactory   for   Quality of pre-interview  preparation  Number of tactics used  for the preparation   Pre-interview  research  and  understanding  of  the role developed  Number  of  use  cases  developed  the  interview  Assessment  of  the  use  cases   Were  you  coached  for  this interview?

Did  you  elaborate  on  the use of cases?  your    Table 12.3: KPIs concerning the interview and job offer phase  So, you get the drift now. Do this exercise as often as you can. In case you are not  getting any interview offers, do mock drills, and get responses recorded as well. Now let's go beyond all this and get fetch some indicators that will help you measure  the progress of your career:  Factor  Best  case   Meeting  standards  Need  help  What went  well  wrong  The   outcome is  less than  satisfactory   172      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Were you able to  showcase your  problem-solving skills?

Bring in as many relevant factors as possible so that you get more clarity on  your standing as far as your career path is concerned. You are the best person to do  this, as you know, your immediate operational and strategic context as far as your  career is concerned. The above table is not exhaustive, and you will be expected to add more rows.  Follow the same process as before  the scoring process adopted for all other tables   and pull out the information on the aspects that are slowing you down. This table  is just a starting point in the process, and the overall exercise needs to be made as  transparent and comprehensive as possible. As before, have another pair of eyes  scan and review this for you. Objectivity should always be beyond the realm of  compromise. Ultimately,  you  are  the  best  judge  of  your  progress  or  lack  of  it.  If  you  have  programmed your mind enough, you will know when your career is slowing down  and needs change. If you observe the following signs, you need a course correction:         If you have been attentive enough, you will be able to decipher these signs very  early. Sometimes it sets in like wet cement and then dries up trapping you in it while  you were not paying attention. At any point in time, if you feel that your intellectual  capabilities are not being tested enough, you can start the process of introspection.  This should be your first sign of trouble, your canary if you will. If you let your  intellectual abilities erode, then done blame anyone else later when you are unable  to take on bigger challenges later on in your career. 12.5 Findings and remediation Suppose you identify the areas for improvement that could be the next step. Table  12.5 below could serve as guidance:     Restlessness, a feeling that you are pulling your weight.    Feeling that you don't belong to your team organization.    The generic feeling of disappointment and lack of enthusiasm.    You feel like you are doing things just for sake of it.

Act with diligence and  introspection to identify every component and figure out an appropriate solution.  Take help in case you are unable to do that by yourself. In the ET world, you will have enough challenges to address so you will not be bored  or feeling as though you need to have more challenging assignments come your  way. These assignments will find you, but you need to be prepared to take them  up and solve them using the best of your abilities. No matter what the challenge at  whichever stage in your career, here are a few solutions you can consider:    Join an online course or take up classroom programs at a b-school or a tech  school.         Ask for advice from a senior in the industry.    Look out for a new opportunity with clarity in terms of what you want out           of the role.     Read more books.   176      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Volunteer for a social cause; this will help you see things in a new light.    Take a vacation, go trekking or backpacking.    Take up a new hobby.    Spend time with your family.          Conclusion Let me end by talking about three conditions of the mind that are harmful to the  progress of mankind. These are procrastination, assumptions, and resting on past  laurels. There are innumerable stories of people who were swept away by waves  of change because their minds were resting on one or more of these states of mind. Assumption destroys you from within, procrastination slows you down, and resting  on past laurels simply lulls you into slumber. Use every failure or success to grow  further. Keep pushing the benchmarks higher but don't drain your energies in the  process. This is where inspiration comes in. Inspiration is the fuel for success and  you need it in good amounts to win every battle. Armies around the world spend billions to gain situational awareness during times  of war and peace. You should also invest your time and attention to be aware of  your  environment.  Situational  awareness  connects  you  with  your  environment  and makes you understand the forces at play that you can bend or utilize to your  advantage. Being mindful is not just a virtue but it is a game changer. It is that no- nonsense weapon in your arsenal that comes handy in all situations. Questions and answers 1.  How do I know which course correction path I should take?     Ans. You can always seek advice. Otherwise, the best option is to go by trial    and error method  provided you are patient . You never know how far you  would go till you try.       2.  Why shouldn't salary be considered as a parameter for measuring success?   Ans. Well, it all depends on how you define success. If success is purely a  matter of money, you can use it as a parameter. But always remember that  your salary is a function of many parameters, many of which have less to do  with professional development. For instance, you can get to the right salary  level by taking a new job every few months. But does this mean you have  spent enough time in learning and understanding the context of the job you  left? This is not about targeting some spiritual goals. Instead, this is more  about ensuring that you chase goals that lead to your overall growth.   Measuring Success and Making Course Corrections      177                                3.  For the parameters mentioned in the table, can they be quantified?   Ans. Yes, they can, and you can add that to your to-do list   4.  How long should I wait to start this exercise in my career?   Ans. I don't remember talking about waiting. The earlier it is done, the better.  5.  How much time should I allocate for this exercise every week?   Ans.  It  depends  on  a  few  factors.  The  most  important  of  which  is  how  important is the goal you are seeking or let me put it in another way. How  desperate are you to get to your goal? The more desperate you are, the more  time you will be able to allocate to this.  6.  What are the possible outcomes of this exercise?   Ans. If you do it with objectivity and diligence, you can expect these changes   to your career:    Measurement will lead to improvement.    Your ability to course correct will help you do more new things and   understand the hurdles on the path to success. Identify bright areas for growth and figure out ways to improve.

A couple of decades back, people  used to start and end their careers in the same company and the same industry. That  is no longer the case. Today, many professionals would already have the world for as  many as 3-4 companies before they settle down or stabilize in their careers. A few years back, I had a colleague, a data scientist who had already worked for as  many as 8 companies in his short career of just 5 years. He was a serial hopper, and  his only goal was to increase his salary and move on before he developed problems  with his colleagues. Some of us in the initial stages of our career are like this former  colleague of mine. We usually don't have a long term plan in mind and are more  prone to hopping around just to get a bigger paycheck or a better designation maybe. You will be surprised to know that some of these motivations remain even after  people slip into senior roles and are in leadership positions within their companies.  The lure of a good designation, stock options, or other perks and a salary hike is  often irresistible. Even the most diligent ones among us often end up surrendering  to these distractions.   180      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code Structure In this chapter, you will learn about:    career     The common mistakes people in the ET world commit to managing their      Factors you have to take into account while drawing a career growth plan    Understanding why you need a career plan    Strategies to avoid those mistakes    Career plan paths and templates          Objective      Draw a plan to take control of your career      Ensure you keep moving in the right direction with sufficient momentum      Learn how to deal with a recessionary phase 13.1 The New Year quandary  started   The problem with   short term planning  In  the  2000s  when  the  market  for  expanding,  smartphones  traditional newspapers, initially, saw the  transition to a digital mode of delivery as  a challenge rather than an opportunity. To  compound  the  problem,  many  publishers  had  a  planning  cycle  that  extended  to  a  quarter of a year and not more. smartphone  boom  Thus,  when  occurred,  many  newspapers  had  to  shut  shop as they were unable to adapt to this  new paradigm as they were too focused on  short term goals. In the US alone, as many  as  1800  publications  shut  shop  between  2004 and 2018.  The question we have to ask ourselves  is,  why  do  our  new  year  resolutions  fail  more  often  than  promises  made  by  politicians?  The  answer  is  that  New  Year  resolutions  do  not  often  accompany a plan. The resolutions are  often made on the spot in response to  a  feeling  or  a  conversation  and  there  is  never  any  intention  in  the  person  concerned to follow-up and takes the  resolution to its conclusion. You have heard a lot about planning in  the preceding chapters. From here on,  we are going to look at planning in a  slightly different way. At  this  point,  you  have  a  bagged  a  good role in an ET company and are  more or less cruising along. Your new  role is fantastic, and you are now in a whole new world filled with new challenges.  You get so involved in your work that you are now ignoring the next steps as you  are too busy for that.  the    Drawing the Two-Year Plan      181  Yes, as I have said before, it is easy to lose track of your career once you are in the  middle of things. So it is essential to know that you have only completed the first  part of your journey. You still have things to do on your list that we began with. So  how do you stay alert about your career, if you are too busy? Here are a few steps:       Always seek a deeper meaning that goes beyond your immediate sphere of  work. Linking work with personal and professional developments is a great  idea. Take some time out every few months and ask yourself the following  questions o  o  o  Has my life become too automated? o   Is there something more I can do in my current role?  Is my world too theoretical?   If  your  answer  is  yes  to  any  two  options  above,  then  you  need  to  change a few things about yourself and let this become a trigger for  you to embrace change     Keep track of the changes that are happening around you and within you.               Maintain a journal.              Keep  track  of  the  industry  you  are  in  and  how  the  technology  you  are  working on is evolving; are you getting to work on some of the path-breaking  developments happening out there?     Travel, attend conferences, and ask people questions on how their careers are   shaping up. That will give you some ideas.     Read  more  often.  Reading  will  help  your  mind  open  up  and  figure  out   solutions on its own.  13.2 Career growth factors When it comes to career planning, it is important to understand how various factors  play out so that you can prepare accordingly. The first of these key factors is the  recession. 13.2.1 Recession I have dealt with a few topics related to the recession in the chapter on dealing with  headwinds. Here we will look at some other aspects and under the basics of how  certain phases of recession can impact your career. The Coronavirus epidemic that broke out in China in November  or earlier?  last  year  became  a  global  pandemic  while  I  was  writing  this  book.  The  disease  has  opened our eyes to a whole new dimension that many of us never pondered before.    182      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  This is the first instance of a pandemic induced recession that we have seen in recent  times. Once the pandemic is brought under control, more effects of the Coronavirus- induced recession will emerge.  Till then, every forecast, every prediction will be but  mere speculation, and we hear lots of it. The pandemic is shaking and reshaping the social order in many countries. The law  and order problems in the Americas and some geopolitical tensions we are seeing in  Asia are all an outcome of the pandemic in one form or other. Just like every other  major issue with political undertones, the virus has divided people into various  camps such as those who want everyone to wear a mask vs. those don't; those who  want the lockdowns to end vs. those who don't; those who want the rate of testing to  increase vs. those who don't. These chasms have split societies down to the middle  with governments looking for answers and not finding any. No matter what happens, the world is changing, and it will be a different one from  the one we had at the start of the year 2020. Could this mean we will now have to go  through another round of screening at airports? Will work from home become the  new norm? We don't know, but we can look at previous recessions to obtain a clue  on where things are headed:   Figure 13.1  Take a look at the table above. This table lists the major recession periods that the USA  has gone through in the last 100 years. Since the first US constitution was adopted in  the 18th century, the country has gone through almost 50 recorded recessions. In the  last 8 decades alone, there were 15 official recessions. The last of which supposedly  ended in 2009.   Drawing the Two-Year Plan      183           This data is simply fascinating, and there are many data points in there that I would  like you to pay attention to. Here are a few:         There has been a recession every decade since the 1920s.    The biggest gap between the two phases of recessions has been 8 years and   10 months, back in the 60s.     People born in the 1920s would have lived through a whopping 14 cycles of   recession.     The data only speaks about a recession in terms of its official definition which  implies a period of a significant downturn in an economic activity covering  all sectors of the economy, spanning over two quarters, i.e., 6 months.     Some  of  us  have  experienced  one  or  two  recessions.  The  pandemic  has   created room for another.     World War II was preceded by and succeeded by a recession.    What the data fails to highlight are the aftershocks that follow a period of recession.  For instance, the global job market never really recovered from the recession of 2008.  In many countries, job growth and economic activity were gaining momentum only  now, and here we are, staring at another economic contraction with no expiry date  in sight. Though governments have promised to doll out stimulus packages, we all  know how long that will take to awaken the forces that propel economic growth and  lend it some momentum. Discretionary spending will be controlled by governments for the foreseeable future.  In some countries, the stimulus package and discretionary spending will remain  on paper, albeit it might cause the overall economic spending to rise in the days  to come. The near-collapse of supply chains and the dip in China's manufacturing  output has already impacted many nations. Curbs on the movement of people and  resources put in place by governments to slow down the almost uncontrolled spread  of the virus have compounded the problem. So how will this impact your career plans? Suppose you are planning to have a  career that spans about 3 decades. So going by previous data, you will experience at  least 7 recessions, going by the median of one recession every 4 years. That is a lot.  You will also have about 9 years of sunshine or phases of good growth  the years  between recessions  coming your way. These are the growth years, and therefore  you have to make the maximum use of these. I have stuck to the conservative end  of these estimates to help you plan better. Here are some quick planning pointers:           So you have to make the most of these 9 years to grow.    You have to be careful in June, July, and August every year.    The  beginning  years  and  end  years  of  a  decade  are  when  you  have  the  maximum chances of a recession. This could be an economic correction in  motion or could be a standalone episode.   184      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                 The contraction of the economy slows job and salary growth. So this can  impact  your  salary  growth,  for  instance  by  as  much  as  30  percent  every  decade. Imagine the cumulative impact. In case you were planning to change  a job to get into a higher pay grade you will be impacted on this front as well.    Beyond job markets and salary, many industries re-set themselves after a  recession. For instance, after the recession of 2008 09, the faith in the banking  system  in  many  countries  dwindled,  leading  to  an  explosion  of  Fintech  startups and the emergence of new intermediaries such as those handling  remittances. This shrunk the space available for traditional financial service  providers. In the ET world, the Coronavirus pandemic induced recession  will provide ETs the first playground for expressing their potential. Will they  emerge like the dinosaurs at the end of the Permian or go extinct like them  during the end of Cretaceous? We will find out soon. I am betting on ET  going big in the next two years, so be prepared.     After 2029, almost all the technologies that are categorized as ET will become  traditional, and established technologies, and you need to switch ships again  around this time. You have about 9 years. If another recession hits you by, then, be prepared to stagnate for a while. So  ideally, you should be ready to switch to new technology by 2026.      These are the trends that you need to factor in from a recession perspective in your  two-year plan. 13.2.3 Competition No matter where you go and what you do; you will always have competition around  you. This is also true of the ET world, where competition could come from all kinds  of places, roles, and at any time. As I said before, things move much faster in the  world of ET, and it won't take much for you to be replaced or rendered redundant if  you are not fast enough or doing important things that bring visible results. There is plenty of impatience that goes around, so you need to factor that in your  planning process. To some extent, competition is good. It keeps you on your toes,  makes you focus on improvement and visible results while helping you evolve faster.  I am even told that there are studies that show that the people who are dealing with  competition often perform better than those who don't. Again I haven't come across  any study on this, but it does seem convincing and is more or less in line with what  I have seen in my career. The downside is that unless it is managed well, competition could cause anxiety,  stress, and decreased efficiency also. Just like everything else, your ability to succeed  with the competition is all about how you manage them.   Drawing the Two-Year Plan      185     Your role    The type of projects you get to work on    The length of your tenure    Your overall experience in an organization    Your growth prospects    Your leadership potential  In times of recession or when there is reduced cash flow, competition always can  play a more significant role in shaping your career or at least your tenure in an  organization. In an organization, competition could influence:             No matter where you are or what you do, competition is either already there or  will emerge in due course, and it is something that you need to keep in mind when  planning your tenure and career. Is competition better than collaboration? That's the question that many have asked.  Long ago, when I was working for a company in the Fintech space, I had colleagues  who would come with a request for help and then get me to do their work without  any form of acknowledgment. I used to be pulled up by my boss for missing the  deadline.  “Deadlines  are  always  sacrosanct';  that's  what  she  used  to  say  more  often than I can remember.  If I had a penny for every time, I heard that I wouldn't  be a billionaire, but I could look at affording a retired life in some tropical island  somewhere or stay in Antarctica for the rest of my life  both of which I hope to do  sometime . In my appraisals, my teamwork was appreciated while I got low ratings for finishing  work on time. It is another matter that I was able to learn a lot from the projects  where I helped my colleagues. There were plenty of instances where things didn't  go my way when collaborating with people, but there were many instances where  collaboration made things way easier. We were together able to achieve a lot more  than we could have if we didn't. A big lesson I have learned is that when competition makes it harder for you to  collaborate or even exist, look for new allies. In the organization I mentioned before  where I had colleagues who used to get me to work for them, I had a strong network  of vendors who I could rely on for turning things faster and cheaper than anyone  else in my team. Which is, of course, my next point? Cultivating strong allies within  your team and outside is important from various perspectives. Other than watching  your back, they can also help you               Recover faster when the chips are down.    Act as a circuit breaker for stopping rumors about you.    Their advice could help you see things differently and solve a problem faster.    You can rely on them to help you with your projects.     It is always good to have people vouch for you.   186      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  In many organizations, appraisals are done on a 360-degree basis. I am not a big fan  of appraisals in terms of the way it is done, but a 360-degree approach is essential  as it gives a complete view of your interactions with all stakeholders and no matter  what you need to give people respect and that as my former manager would say is  sacrosanct. Finally, never collaborate only to gain. Always make sure that you are contributing.  You can never learn by always being on the receiving end. 13.2.4 Vendor management Vendors get a lot less credit than they deserve. They are the ones who often help us  shine but are barely mentioned in the credits or anywhere, for that matter. I have  mentioned in a previous chapter how you can get market Intel from them. They can  also help you close projects faster, save on costs, and improve efficiency and quality  of deliverables. In the ET world, there is a significant dependency on vendors. From manufacturers  and  consultants  to  companies  across  the  supply  chain,  you  will  need  to  engage  many players to take things towards closure. In addition to vendors, there will also  be partners who will be helping you along, so that's a vast ecosystem to focus on,  and you could end up paying less attention to some ends of the chain. Vendors are  often not considered a priority once their contribution is received. Thus it is up to you to ensure that you reach out to them and keep them engaged at  times when they are not contributing directly or significantly or not at all. Happy  vendors help you in more ways than you can imagine. But you don't need to do this  only with that objective in mind. Instead, this is an obligation on your part. How can vendors help? They can:           Provide market intelligence.    Offer services or products faster, so that project deadlines are met quickly.    Start  new  product  or  service  lines  to  support  new  demands  linked  to  a   project.              Help with compliance mandates.    Help prevent supply chain poisoning.    Help identify new opportunities for your company or you.    Contribute to the planning process by providing a new set of eyes to verify   delivery schedules or other aspects.  In my career, I have often worked with vendors who have helped me in these areas.  I have always had vendors offer preferential rates way below the market rates. In  some instances, even below those offered to other teams within my organization.   Drawing the Two-Year Plan      187  I have always treated vendors as allies, take their inputs on aspects of projects they are  contributing to and never put undue pressure on them. During one of my previous  stints,  my  manager  asked  me  to  close  a  critical  project  within  an  unreasonable  schedule. While I could close my half of the work quickly, I still had to work with a  vendor who was clear that the work couldn't be completed within the timelines my  manager was envisaging. I supported the vendor and conveyed the same information to my manager, who  said he would walk down from his high throne and speak to the vendor himself.  I obliged and shared the vendor's number with my manager. I was present in his  cabin when this conversation happened. My manager threw some big names within our multi-billion company  one of the  top-three enterprise software players in the world  to convince the vendor to agree.  Do you know? The vice-president of our organization is directly involved in this  project? My manager said. To which the vendor said, even if your CEO comes and  personally asks me to do this job within the next three days, it cannot happen. The system  cannot work at that speed, and we need to be realistic, he said. My manager got angry and asked me to change the vendor immediately. I calmly  told him that if we change the vendor now, we can kiss the project goodbye as a new  vendor will take at least 5 weeks to deliver what we are getting in a week. Further,  onboarding complications will ensure that we cannot even start the work until at  least a week. My manager grudgingly agreed to let the vendor work according to his timeline.  The vendor is still active with this big corporation, and we do occasionally meet and  laugh, remembering that and many such incidents. Vendors need to be supported when needed; a relationship of trust once established  can go a long way in helping both sides do a lot more together. More importantly, the  spirit of collaboration that emerges from such a relationship can teach you a lot more  than what you can learn from any collaborative project within your organization or  with partners. 13.2.5 Research Some of us do more research on finding better prices for apparel and consumer  goods as compared to our professional lives. Well, this could either indicate the  priority hierarchy or plain lack of interest. This is something that needs to change if  you have to move into the big league. In the ET world, you will have to do tones of research by yourself, so you need to  have your research skills sharpened and ready. Mostly, your research will be on:         Competition    Pricing of product\service   188      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Improving a process Job search           Market trends    Vendors    On a person, you are planning to on-board    On prospect companies    A more efficient DevOps methodology    For lines of code    Methods to improve compliance    Government policies or guidelines                      No matter what you conduct your research on, you will still be needed to do a lot  of in-depth data mining. In my whole career, I have never approached a research  firm for help in my research. Once, while working for an IoT company, we were  compelled to hire a big consulting firm to write a paper. Well, the paper that came  out had about 85 percent content that we had prepared, and that gave me a huge  clue into how these big firms work. But this piece is not about the consulting firms.  It is instead of you. Developing a deep research capability is an important skill. Many times, I have used  this facility to help my senior leadership approach critical conversations or present  at crucial meetings. Once you do some basic research, you will be surprised to find out the type of  information that people put up on the internet. For instance, if you have to know  what a company is doing in a specific area, just identify some key people and check  their LinkedIn profile. If that sounds tough, look at presentation notes or YouTube  videos from industry events  especially QnA . If that sounds tough, look at their  blog posts, or Twitter feeds. Yes, people put up a lot of valuable information on the web, and most of it is not even  behind a landing pad that needs you to share a viable email address to download  that information. Looks like they are confident that no one would go through so  much effort to discover information. These are a few things I have stumbled on  while doing my online research:    Instructions to an APT group from their handler  Google to find out about  APT groups .     A  policy  doctrine  document  belonging  to  a  government  agency  marked          confidential.           Recruitment form for an intelligence agency that was hidden in plain sight   but not accessible through any sitemap or links on their website.     Confidential share price movement information forecast by an analyst.   Drawing the Two-Year Plan      189                Information  on  a  confidential  cargo  being  moved  to  a  pariah  country  in  South East Asia. Information  on  an  M&A  project  including  deliverables  and  timelines  uploaded as a presentation.  You could research many other things. But the point is why and how. Many of us just  rely on our network to give us good information. Others just throw up their hands  and say there is a lack of data. In my current role, when we were trying to do some research on the comprehensive  cybersecurity and threat environment in a few countries, we came across data that  was either stale or did not add up to what we were uncovering from our network  of honeypots  google honeypot networks+cybersecurity . So we decided to publish  our reports so that everyone has relevant information available in case they want  to learn about the threats out there. Awareness, after all, is the most important and  fundamental aspect of anything we want to do or experience. Information is power  and the first and the most basic pillar of empowerment. If you see an information gap in the market that you can address, no matter who  you are – an individual or an organization, try and address that. An information gap  is an opportunity no matter which way you look at it. Even an attempt at plugging  an information gap will take you closer to competition or help you leave it behind.  Societies and countries that have relied on information or allow transparency in  governance and business are the ones that grow and thrive. We have all seen how  the iron curtain in Europe fell in the last nineties with the demise of a large country  that was always economical with information. Your ability to conduct research is not just a luxury but is a necessity at all times.  If you can conduct research, identify patterns, and share them with the relevant  shareholders, you will be in a much better position than any rival and will head to  your goal much faster. Sharing or publishing your research is also important, and  that brings us to our next point. 13.2.6 Written communication Communication  deserves  a  chapter  treatment;  therefore,  I  will  be  giving  you  a  separate chapter on that later. In the meantime, let's focus on an important form  of  communication.  Writing  has  become  a  leading  technology  for  expressing,  manipulating,  storing,  accessing,  communicating,  engaging  with  audiences,  and  disseminating information. It has been around in one form or another for at least  5000 years. Writing emerged independently in five ancient civilizations, including Mesopotamia,  Egypt,  China,  Indus  Valley,  and  lowland  Mesoamerica.  In  nature,  when  a  trait  emerges independently in multiple species, it is considered important. Think of flying   evolved independently in birds, bats, and insects , eyes  evolved independently as       190      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  many as 50 times in flies, flatworms, mollusks, and vertebrates and blood  almost  100 times  In civilizations, whenever a skill emerges independently across continents and era's,  one can easily classify it as an important one. Writing is one such skill, and the very  fact that it has been invented so many times clearly shows its significance. Out study  of  the  Indus  Valley  Civilization  is  considered  incomplete  because  we  have  been  unable to decipher its script. The Sumerians invented writing as a means of long-distance communication. With  the rise in the area under the governance of cities, it became necessary to capture  and transmit information without having to worry about or rely on the memory of  a messenger or someone designated to take the message to its intended recipient. Since ages, mankind has relied on writing to pass on stories, learnings, cultural  information,  and  other  important  bits  of  knowledge  across  generations  and  geographies. It is a known fact that in the case of many cultures that were plundered  by invaders, one of the first tasks the invaders used to execute was to destroy the  documents of the culture they were planning to subjugate. When the city of Yucatan  in Mexico was conquered by Spain in the 16th century, many Mayan books dealing  with cultural aspects of the Mayans were destroyed by the conquerors. A marauding Turkish force led by Bakhtiyar Khalji attacked and destroyed a famous  university of learning in India in the 12th century. It is said that the library of this  then world-famous seat of higher learning was burnt by Khaliji, and it burned for  nearly 3 months. It is hard to imagine the collective loss that mankind has suffered  due to the actions of a few who could never grasp the importance of education and  arts. Who knows how different a path history could have taken if all those books in  Mexico, India, and other parts of the world survived and guided our curiosity and  informed various aspects of our history? Well, we will never know. Writing helped preserve a lot of information that we could have potentially lost.  Besides, today, it opens a window to let us peek into the past and connect with  cultures and civilizations that no longer exist. A writer never dies what they say. So why did I take you on a journey into our past? Well, it is very important to assign  the right level of importance to writing. Today we take writing for granted, relying  on it only to craft email messages, social media posts, or instant messaging messages.  But little do we realize how far this technology has come and how much it has helped  us in our collective evolution as a species. It is important to write. Writing helps you churn your thoughts inside your mind and  get more clarity on how to approach an idea from different perspectives. In a Fintech  company that I used to work for long ago, almost all of our leaders used to write.  They have published authors and were recognized subject matter experts in their  fields. Our company was a thought leader in the Fintech space, and I never had a  problem with getting whitepapers and thought pieces of amazing quality from them.   Drawing the Two-Year Plan      191  Every business unit in that company was led by someone proficient in ideas and in  expressing them. When we were later acquired by Oracle, one of the first things my  counterpart in Oracle mentioned was that we had more content than the whole of  Oracle, even though we were nowhere as large as them. They were impressed by the  breadth and depth of the content that we had created. All of this content was then  taken over by Oracle and re-branded. Working  with  this  company  helped  me  understand  the  significance  of  writing.  Interestingly, when I was being interviewed for this company, when my future manager  asked me what I would be doing 5 years down the line, without batting an eyelid, I said  I would be a published author by then. It took me more than 5 years to get my first  book out because I had seen the kind of thinking and ideation that was needed to create  quality content and that is one lesson that I will never forget in a hurry. It took me almost a decade to figure out a topic and a year to get my ideas together.  The research took another year, and the actual writing bit took almost 9 months. Speaking on a topic and writing carry almost equal weight when it comes to learning.  Both help you understand the subject better and gain a new perspective. For many  of us, writing is a chore, a burden to be deal with. Sometimes even an email drains  some of us. Have we ever wondered why it is so? Because we don't like writing. Is  there some way in which we can go ahead and like writing? Yes, and I will deal with  that in the chapter on communication skills. In this chapter, I will try and establish a case for you to write more often. Writing  helps:       You  communicate  more  efficiently  and  reduce   the  chances  of  a   miscommunication  with more practice .     Helps you connect directly without the target audience without having to   have some else package your thoughts for you.     You build another income stream as authors get paid.    Build credibility and thought leadership.    You leave your thoughts behind; you can even revisit it later to see how your   thinking has evolved over the years.     You keep your neural networks active, and your mind in top gear as writing  is more than thinking. You need to structure your thoughts, find the write  words, and sew them together in a coherent way.  Organizations  that  promote  thought  leadership  and  encourage  their  employees  to turn into SMEs also encourage their employees to write and publish their work  internally  or  externally.  Every  company  has  a  blog,  but  how  many  employees  contribute to that blog? How many do that frequently, and how many times do  companies have to source content? I am happy to share that in all companies I have  worked with, I have helped prevent the outsourcing of content work. Many vendors  still hate more for that.                192      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  This is a strategic decision. By not outsourcing your content, you also keep a tight  grip on preventing your inhouse knowledge from going outside your company and  helping the competition. A good content shop is hard to set and harder to run, and  if you are doing that within your company, make sure that you don't allow anyone  to steal your thunder. In segments like cybersecurity, IoT, etc., it is tough to find people who can generate  good content, so train your colleagues. This is in addition to doing it yourself so that  your content calendar is chock a block, and you have a problem of plenty. Every single  marketing agency claims to create content but those of us who are in the industry  know-how to identify content that has been created outside the organization. Just to clarify, I am not saying that it is a bad practice to outsource content. I am just  saying that you are better off in so many ways by producing content inhouse. 13.2.7 Skill map As the cliché goes, what got you here isn't going to take you here won't get you  there. I have dealt with this topic before, but here I am going to touch upon another  factor, which is building skills on the job. Many people I know often say that they  have learned everything they need to do on the job and that they don't need to  learn anything else. This is also the reason why many of us don't read well; that's a  different story.  The truth is that everyone needs to learn and unlearn, as well. Even after you have taken a certification course or, better yet, attended classroom  sessions, it will take a while for the learning to kick in and help you in your day to  day activities. So you need to approach learning with patience. Key areas where you  will need help in non-technical areas include:           On the technical side, the list is nearly endless. Even the areas mentioned above are  not exhaustive. Find out the areas that you need to work on and get your learning  going. I would suggest you target doing at least one certification every 6 months.  That's a healthy run-rate to maintain. 13.2.8 Leadership This is another important factor. Work out the kind of leader you want to be in the  next two years. A good place to start would be by evaluating your leadership in  situations in the past. Find out what are the aspects that you need to work on so that  you have a clear path to a leadership role chalked out.     Negotiation    Project management    Communication    Time management    Leadership   Drawing the Two-Year Plan      193     Autocratic    Laissez-Faire    Authoritative    Pacesetting    Democratic    Coaching    Affiliative  Leadership is never an easy concept to understand. There are as many definitions  of  leadership  as  there  are  flavors.  Situational  leadership,  episodal  leadership,  leadership,  leadership  by  a  plan,  leadership  by  the  reaction,  and  there  are  also  different styles of leadership as well such as:               A leadership development plan should be an essential part of your two-year plan.  Some element of leadership is not just a need but a necessity. 13.3 The two-year plan Many of us operate without a well-crafted plan in our careers. For some of us, only  three things matter a good designation, salary, and an on-site assignment. When any  of these is not available, people move out, and that is the only plan that many people  have. We both know that is not a recommended way of doing things. Now that you know all the elements arrange them in a table and see how you can  fit  them  into  a  plan.  Break  everything  down  into  individual  elements  and  give  everything a timeline so that you can track them:  Factor   Current state  Ideal state   Targets  Dates  Recession readiness  Competition  Vendor management  Written communication  Research  Leadership   Table 13.1: Plan components  The above table is what can be called a crude plan. You can have a detailed one with  more fields and items to track created. The factors that I have outlined are the crucial  ones and require plenty of attention, and each of those will play a significant role in  shaping your career. Even within the two-year window, you need to put together  some short and long term goals. Short term goals could include a promotion while a    194      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  long term goal could be a transition into a leadership role. You can decide how you  want to categorize your goals. While planning, keep these handy,    Identify  clearly  defined  goals   i.e.,  goals  that  are  Specific,  Measurable,  Achievable, Realistic, and Timely.          Draw a clear visual picture in your mind in terms of where you see yourself                 Jot down a set of actions corresponding to these goals.   this applies more to long term plans .    Ask yourself questions at every step.       Set aside a timeline for each action.    Keep assessing your capabilities and priorities.     Identify and allocate resources where needed  skill up-gradation, soft skills,  or leadership .     Monitor your progress.    Stay healthy.    Review and reset as and when required.        Here is a template that you can use to identify and tackle challenges that you will  face during execution: Challenge issue: Goal connected with the challenge: Plan of action:             Progress measurement indicators Clear evidence of addressing the challenge or overcoming it.     Degree of effort required to address the challenge    Specific actions to be taken    People who can help you and resources you need    Timeline for each step and action    Potential hurdles to be overcome     Impact and outcome of effort  Examples of goals        Increase frequency of networking activities on social media and trough in- person events or even webinars or online events   Drawing the Two-Year Plan      195                        Join the leadership team I want to be a get promoted to a ___________________  target role  I want to work on this technology _____________________ Increase  my  influence  in  the  company industry  and  turn  into  a  thought  leader  Improve the quality of conversations. Reduce complaining, increase listening     Get a raise.    Take a vacation in _____    Take on new responsibilities       Achieve ___ level of delegation    Seek, get and document feedback              You need to run your career as a strategic business unit. Which means that you have  both strategic and tactical elements to work with and on. Once you start tracking  these factors and build on them, you will know exactly how fast are you going   moving forward from the last chapter . 13.3.1 Remember these pitfalls           Avoid gathering too much data. Clear the clutter once a while    Avoid the temptation to be disorganized    Avoid doing things just for the sake of doing it. Every task has to have a goal   assigned to it     Don't be sloppy    Avoid procrastination      Conclusion Two years is a long time in your career. It is a good enough block for you to act to  improve and rectify. In today's day and age when recessions strike without notice, a  plan helps you form a strong foundation to fall back on. It also helps you strengthen  your fundamentals so that the foundation of your career doesn't shake every time  there are tremors in the industry and elsewhere. Everyone plans but only a few act on their plans. So make sure your plan doesn't  stay on paper.   196      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code Questions and answers 1.  Why should it be a two-year plan?     Ans. Two years is a good unit to split your career into. You can split it further    into blocks of 6 months, but it is advisable to follow a two-year format. By  going for two years, you will be able to detect and identify all forces that are  shaping your career and figure out the impact of these forces and ways to  deal with them as well.                      2.  How can I assess my needs at a certain stage of my career?   Ans. Without a plan, you will never be able to see what is going wrong, which  is why I am advocating a method using which you will be able to conduct a  review of your career, identify opportunities for growth and improvement,  learn to handle forces and factors and work on them. Without a plan, you  will not be able to do all this. A formal plan is essential.  3.  How much time should I spend every week on this exercise?   Ans. Two hours every week should suffice. It depends on your goals, targets,   and how soon you want to achieve them.  4.  Should I factor salary, designation, etc. in the plan?   Ans. Anything that helps you identify areas for growth and improvement   can be added to the plan.  5.  Can I have multiple goals?   Ans. Yes, but make them fit into the SMART framework I have mentioned   before.   Building Your Leadership Capabilities      197  Chapter 14 Building Your  Leadership  Capabilities  Introduction In this chapter, you will learn about leadership aspects related to ET. Leadership  capabilities represent a prism, a rainbow if you will of capabilities that get displayed  when a situation arises. History speaks well about leaders who have taken charge,  inspired  people  during  the  darkest  hours,  and  have  led  people  to  freedom,  emancipation, and greatness. There are many examples of fine leaders in history and the present. Leadership is not  just restricted to the battlefield alone and includes leaders who exhibit leadership  traits  regularly  across  boardrooms,  legislative  assemblies,  healthcare  facilities,  streets, calamity-hit areas, and more. Leadership is the expression of one's true potential and it is in a way close to the  zenith of personal and professional growth. Structure Specifically, we will be covering these areas:         Types of leadership and their implications    Leadership situations and lessons   198      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Impact of automation on leadership        ET as a crucible for leadership      Objective Design  thinking,  strategic  management,  adaptability,  data  governance,  customer  satisfaction, sales, disaster management, and market intelligence. These are some of  the skills that are much in demand among businesses looking to fill leadership roles  in their organizations. Is the situation any different in the ET world? Does it take  something else to succeed here? 14.1 No place to hide Businesses that are running digital transformation projects where an ET company is  a vendor or rather an enabler will also look for similar skills as far as their leaders  are concerned. So sooner rather than later, you will be asked to demonstrate these  skills. In the ET World, you will have no place to hide such skills, so it is all about  either  evolving  them  or  becoming  redundant.  These  skills  cannot  be  developed  overnight, so you better start working on them soon so that they are in good shape  to be presented to the world when the situation demands. During one of my conversations with a former manager, he mentioned how he has  come from an organization where he had nearly 5000 people in his team. The larger  organization has more than 100000 people. So, if anyone had to hide  their incompetence  or lack of skills or energy or enthusiasm or a mixture of all of these , it was very easy as every  task had 5-6 people working on it and 10-15 people managing it, he said. This sums up the situation in most prominent companies that are mainly working  on  traditional  technologies  or  approaching  ET  through  traditional  frameworks,  processes, and state of mind. In so many companies, leadership is equated with a  fancy designation, a team size running into hundreds, and a cabin in some instances.  I find such paraphernalia funny and highly irrelevant to the interests of any company. Fortunately,  that  is  not  the  case  in  the  ET  world.  You  cannot  take  anything  for  granted except having to do more with less. Your approach to leadership here also  must consider many factors, including:               Market dynamics and changing receptivity levels to your company's offering.       Competition.    They need to be ruthlessly efficient.    Follow compliance mandates where needed.  Internal uncertainties including funding and resource availability.   Building Your Leadership Capabilities      199        Stave off pressure from various teams and stakeholders including VCs or   other sources of funding.     Be ready for Black Swan events.    In  the  ET  world,  you  are  thrust  into  leadership  roles  very  early  in  your  career.  Sometimes you get to do more as an intern in an ET start-up than you do as a leader  or a mid-level techie in an established business.  A few months ago, before the Coronavirus epidemic became a pandemic, I chanced  upon an interesting conversation on Twitter. Someone had posted a series of tweets  sharing how his life changed after he joined what was arguably a large company  that is today synonymous with search engines and smartphones. It is said that it is  harder to get a position in this company than getting into Harvard. This  person  claimed  that  after  he  joined  this  company,  he  literally  doesn't  have  much to do and therefore has too much time on his hands. He says that in the start- up where he used to work before, he used to work a lot, including weekends, and  he was way more productive and engaged. He felt betrayed by his new employer,  whom he thought would engage his capabilities well. Interestingly, there are an article 6 Reasons Working at ________ Isn't Right for Most  People. The heading is self-explanatory, and the article is a good read. You can Google  it.  The  reasons  mentioned  are  quite  relevant  and  reasonable.  A  counter-argument  would be that this person wasn't looking for a so-called work-life balance and that he  wouldn't be happy in any company as his bar was set very high. Idealism comes with an opportunity cost, just like every other decision you make.  The cost may be in terms of more work, less salary, or even avoiding a chance to  work with a most admired employer. What's worse is that your definition of idealism  may vary from something that someone else subscribes to. But these are just points  for debate. Most of us should know what we want from life in one way or another  else we will set ourselves up for a bigger disaster. 14.2 Types of leadership There are a zillion types of leaders out there. Each one of us is a leader in one way or  another and is involved in solving problems for others.           Situational: When a leader takes control of a situation or a crisis.    Reactive: When a leader responds to a situation.    Pro-active: Developing skills or capabilities while anticipating a situation or   leadership need.   200      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code        Text-book: A leader who goes by management principles or exhibits enough   skills in a manner that is clear enough to be documented in depth. Inspirational: Someone who leads by vision and ideas.          Aspirational: Someone who sets the standards.      Pragmatic: Someone who leads by actions.   14.3 Measurable leadership Leaders are not born overnight. Often when a certain leadership trait is recognized  or appreciated in someone, he or she must have received opportunities in some  form or manner to hone such skills and take it to a level where it becomes apparent.  You must have heard of people who have literally risen from the streets to heading  companies and doing some fantastic and path-breaking work in the process and  are now serving as inspiration for many others. They have gone through the grind,  experiencing and dealing with situations and coming out of it with skills and lessons  that helped them deal with other situations that came their way in the future. In the world of sports, leadership can be a tricky proposition. If your leadership  wins games, you are cheered and toasted as an able leader. But on the other hand,  if you lose one game, people waste no time in pulling you down and questioning  your leadership credentials. In the armed forces, you are always tested. In times of  peace, you will be called upon to take on tasks like organizing disaster relief efforts  or responding to a pandemic or to help the government move people in times of a  geopolitical situation. In the case of listed companies, the movement of stock price decides the fortunes  of a CEO. Politicians feign leadership skills to get themselves re-elected, and these  days, we are increasingly running into leaders who are boastful and pat themselves  on  their  backs  for  doing  what  they  were  supposed  to  do  in  a  situation  without  improving the outcomes in any way. Leadership is never a simple concept to understand, which is why it is a tough  subject to teach. A famous thought leader had said that leadership is all about falling  in love and staying there. I am not sure if it is that easy or tough, as no one has  measured the difficulty in consistently demonstrating leadership skills. But it is not  an easy thing to do, and that's for sure. Leadership is a journey, and there is no way of determining at what point someone  developed a skill that made them a leader before that skill was even exhibited in  public space or fora. Going back to the evolution example, as evolutionary biologist  Richard Dawkins said in one of his speeches, there is no marker to determine when  the first modern human being walked on earth. This is because every progeny is  only slightly different from their parent or, for that matter, their offspring. So, we    Building Your Leadership Capabilities      201  cannot point out to someone in the evolutionary chain and say with utter certainty  that they were the first modern human being. Also, leadership is not about showcasing one's decision making abilities. Most of  our countries are led by politicians but run by bureaucrats. Bureaucracy is a force  that is only remembered when things go slow. Which is why you hear words like red  tape. The truth is that many efficient bureaucrats work behind the scenes to keep our  countries running in normal and not so normal times. Leadership at the bureaucracy  level is only felt. You may rarely have someone being recognized as a good bureaucrat  in the public domain. Though the arrival of social media is changing that bit. So, measuring the development of leadership skills and capabilities is a tough task.  Consider these questions:         Situation one: Are you a good leader if you can forecast challenges?    Situation two: Or are you a good leader because you were able to reach well   to a situation?  Are you a good leader because you were able to avoid a crisis, or are you a good  leader if you can prevent a crisis? 14.4 Lessons from Enron Enron Corporation was a Houston-based energy, commodities, and services giant. It  was founded in 1985 as a merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. The  Enron scandal that broke in October 2001 led to the bankruptcy of Enron, and the de  facto dissolution of Arthur Andersen, among the five largest audit and accountancy  partnerships in the world. The story of Enron is one of a dramatic rise and an equally tempestuous fall. The  ill-fated company's collapse affected thousands of employees and caused tremors  that went into the heart of Wall Street. At its peak, Enron's shares were worth $90.75.  However,  when  the  firm  declared  bankruptcy  by  December  2,  2001.  The  value  crashed to $0.26. Even now, many wonder how such a powerful business, among the  largest companies in the United States, came apart overnight. Also tough to fathom  is how Enron's leadership fooled regulators for a long period with fake holdings and  fraudulent accounting:                Leadership that derives power from fraudulent practices is bound to fail.    Blind leadership is detrimental to the health of businesses.    Controversial former CEO of Enron  he quit 4 months before Enron filed  for bankruptcy and offloaded $ 60 million of his stake in the corp. before it  collapsed  promoted a toxic culture in the organization. He believed that  money  and  fear  were  the  keys  to  control  people.  He  launched  a  system   Integrity and transparency are important aspects of leadership.   202      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  famously called the rank and yank in which the top performers were rewarded  lavishly and the bottom 20 were fired. A toxic culture can never give good  quality leadership at best it can improve the fortunes of a company.        The  negative  consequence  of  a  toxic  and  decaying  culture  will  show  up   sooner or later in the balance sheet.  14.5 Lessons from paleobiology The  dinosaurs  were  unquestioned  rulers  of  the  Mesozoic.  Evolving  into  various  species  and  forms  to  rule  the  land  and  the  skies,  these  majestic  animals  were  according to paleontologists more evolved than mammals in some respects  lungs  for instance . They evolved and kept evolving to harvest the resources provided  by the Mesozoic environment only to go extinct towards the end of the Cretaceous  thanks in all probability to an asteroid impact. Scientists have long wondered if that's the way humans would also go extinct as  a species from planet earth. According to Lindley Johnson, the Planetary Defence  Officer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration It's 100% certain that  we're going to get hit, but we're not 100% certain when [Sic]. A lot is being written about  this and I will not jump into this debate but there are lessons we can gather from the  way the reptiles colonized the world and disappeared thereafter:       A  crisis  of  calamity  for  one  group   dinosaurs   could  provide  to  be  an   opportunity for another  mammals . If you are adaptable enough, you can survive any crisis  birds .        Given enough time, new leadership niches will open.    The most incredible of all change inducing disasters could start in the most  unimaginable of places giving you little or no reaction time.  Space rock  breaking apart far away .     Nature never allows any species to be dominant for long. Change is the way             of life in nature and in our lives as well.          Diversification doesn't guarantee survival.    Sometimes even preparation cannot save groups. You just cannot prepare for   some events  Coronavirus is another example we will talk about .  14.6 Lessons from the coronavirus outbreak Many theories talk about how the pandemic could have been controlled if China had  shared some crucial information early on. Some also allege that instead of controlling  the travel of people from within Wuhan to other places outside the country, China  allowed people to freely travel. Regardless of what theory you subscribe to or the  position you hold, some facts stand out:   Building Your Leadership Capabilities      203     China had already dealt with an epidemic  SARS  in 2002. SARS originated  in China and spread across the world. Since the world was a less globalized  place in those days, the epidemic didn't become a pandemic. It was expected  to  use  that  playbook  to  control  the  spread,  inform  all  relevant  agencies  outside China, and shut down travel till the spread is controlled.     Both SARS and Covid-19 originated in bats or were connected in some way  to bats, according to an article published by the Business Insider. As per this  article, bats are reservoirs of diseases so caution should have been exercised  in all interactions with these mammals.     Bluedot, a Toronto-based start-up's AI-driven health monitoring platform  had  issued  an  alert  to  clients  about  the  outbreak  in  December  2019.  The  company claims to have used big data analytics to track the outbreak and  spread of epidemics In March 2019, Gao Fu, director of China's Centre for Disease Control and  Prevention  CDC  claimed while a virus could emerge at any time, it would not  in [the] future cause an epidemic on the scale of SARS in 2002-03. What was the  basis for such high levels of confidence? If the confidence was well placed, how did  the outbreak turn into such a big healthcare crisis?     Why did the Wuhan Municipal Health Authority claim that there has been  no person-to-person spread? 56 people  according to Chinese government  figures  were already infected by this time  early January 2020 . Was there  enough data available to make such a claim? The World Health Organization  went on to repeat this claim. Instead of treating this episode as a potential  SARS-like outbreak, the threat factor was downgraded immensely by this  assertion. No one for how long this claim stood ground in Wuhan and the  whole of China.      Everything shared above is based on published research and news items in prominent  newspapers. These are hard facts. Considering the above facts, it is easy to derive the leadership lessons from this  episode:       Containing a disaster that affects other stakeholders should always be a joint  effort. Chernobyl has shown that after the genie is out of the bag, putting  it back will require help from everyone, so the best option is to inform all  stakeholders early on.     Transparency is not a mere option. It is a necessity.    No matter who you are, once your credibility is hurt, your business will also  be hurt, and it will take time to recover. The moot question is do you have  time?     Denial prolongs a crisis and negatively impacts your standing.                          204      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code 14.7 Lessons from 9 11 September 11, 2001, will always be counted among the most important dates in the  lifetime of my generation and a few others as well. Anyone who was old enough then  may remember where exactly we were when we heard about the planes crashing into  the twin towers. As the debris smoldered and the US Air Force fighter jets were seen  in the skies again, a nation was galvanized into action and rallied behind President  George W Bush who lost time in announcing I can hear you, the rest of the world can  hear you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. 9 11 was indeed a watershed moment in history. We can endlessly speculate how  different the world would have been if it wouldn't have happened, but we will never  know. As a decade, the nineties were a memorable one for many of us. 9 11 changed  all that and in a way, as someone put it, it announced the end of an era of innocence  that began with the collapse of the iron curtain. As a President, George W Bush wasn't doing all that well before this event. Post 9 11,  his approval ratings soared as he exhibited remarkable leadership skills and was  seen to be firmly in control. Rudy Giuliani was commended for the way he led the  city of New York in the aftermath of the event as its mayor. The nation was angry and wanted some form of retaliation which Bush jr. promised.  No one had the time to question the intelligence lapses that led to this event including  the now-famous Bin Laden determined to strike memo that was overlooked by him in  August 2001. Lessons:       The  crisis  is  an  opportunity  to  display  leadership  skills  and  in  bringing   people together.     No matter what you do during a crisis, people will introspect your behavior  and decisions taken before and after the crisis. This is usually done once  the crisis blows over and people have more time to examine the events that  occurred     Communication is very important during a crisis.    Put people at ease. There will always be more than enough anxious people   in the room.     Pay attention and you might find people who are suffering silently in many  ways  after 9 11, one set of people who were ignored were the survivors.  They were ignored and sometimes ridiculed. All that changed once they  were organized into a group and rallied together .     Risk is always a complex proposition so make sure you train as often as you   can to cover as many eventualities as possible.                 Building Your Leadership Capabilities      205     Act with empathy and understanding there is always time for business; take      New  opportunities  will  arise;  you  need  to  be  patient  and  attentive  to         care of people first.  capitalize on them.  14.8 Change, an essential aspect of  leadership Change before you have to. The worst mistake is to do the right thing for too long, says John  Chambers, the former CEO of CISCO. There are enough examples of companies that  have not done well or have vanished because they refused to evolve or adapt to  the changing business or customer environment around them. The same holds for  people as well.   You should when to quit and when to hold on. Dealing with a change of environment  or  business  factors  or  even  people's  perception  is  always  a  challenge.  Since  the  impact of such changes cannot be measured in its entirety, it becomes difficult to  quantify information available for decision making.  Leaders change. Sometimes as a reaction and sometimes before they are forced to do  so by circumstances. These are some of the traits leaders are expected to maintain in  times of change or transition:               14.9 Automation driving transformation As part of their digital transformation efforts, many companies including those in the  ET world are trying to bring in a higher degree of automation across processes and      Looking ahead    Set pragmatic goals but be visionary in thinking    Be accountable and set accountability standards    Collaborate: take help from allies and build new ones    Exhibit empathy and compassion    Be flexible and accommodative    Be positive, stay calm and address anxiety in others   206      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  decision-making frameworks. Such moves have also helped in making organizations  more transparent and paved the way for more accountability across functions:  Figure 14.1: Degree of automation deployment complexity and scope of impact  In the chart above we are pitting the impact of automation on various aspects of an  organization and the degree of complexity associated with each factor in terms of  implementation of automation measures. There is a degree of complexity involved  in automating every process. This complexity also takes a toll on the outcomes and  the time taken for automating key areas of operations. While the degree of effort  involved  in  automating  leadership  is  enormous  it  is  also  one  area  that  has  the  greatest impact on an organization. The biggest challenge in automating leadership lies in identifying input streams and  in capturing interactions that are of consequence. These are some of the aspects that  relate to automation and freeing up of thinking capacity for leaders to focus on core  aspects and strategy:       Automating management: Using data analytics and AI to automate decision   making and optimizing processes, business, and activities.     Automating operations: Using complex workflows and robotics, IoT, VR,   analytics, AI, and other means to automate operations. Improving  leadership  quality:  Using  technology  to  augment  human  capabilities,  decision-making  learning,  and  other  qualities  to  shape  the  future of processes and activities.

Today, however, the scope has widened to include many other aspects that  can also include leading by empathy, ability to promote an environment of trust and  inclusion as also managing the career aspirations of team members. In the ET world, leadership is a more  inclusive  word. As  I  have  mentioned  before,  you  get  to  do  things  way  earlier in your career which means that  you get to test your skills and polish  them  as  you  go  along.  Exposure  to  multiple  frameworks,  competition,  project  management  measures,  working  with  a  paucity  of  resources, funding and more challenges  help you do more with less. Such a vast exposure itself gives you an  incredible edge. The onus is however  on you to use this exposure and take  your leadership skills to the next level  by  applying  your  decision-making  skills  and  other  approaches  to  the  next level. A conscious effort can help  you  reach  there  faster.  The  common  mistakes that many ET folks make in  this area are:    Lincoln  led  USA  during  what  could  arguably be the most testing times in the  history of the country. Life prepared him  for that role from a very early stage in his  life. He lost his mother at a very young age,  had to put up with an abusive father, his  wife died early and three of his sons died  young. It is said that he survived at least  6 episodes of depression. There were times  when his friends used to remove all knives  from his house for suicidal fears. Not  only  did  Lincoln  recover  from  these  events, but he went on to lead the nation  with character and grace. He was a great  communicator and used to read frequently.  He was able to connect with and put people  before everything. It  is  almost  as  if  Lincoln  was  schooled  in  leadership  by  the  events  that  tested  his  character  and  resolve.  Lincoln  held  steady  and  never  surrendered  to  his  circumstances and today he is remembered  as one of the most able and loved presidents  of the USA. Nothing worthwhile is ever  achieved through a life that lacks hardship.  We  learn  through  challenges  and  grow  through effort.  cross-functional  exposure by staying focused on  their job roles.     Working  with  the  assumption  that  they  become  a  leader  as  they move along in their career   this is not at all necessary.     Not working with a long-term   leadership plan.     Avoiding          208      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Connecting designation with leadership  these are two different things .    Leadership is not something that happens to you. Situational leadership may or  may not help your leadership journey. At every level, you need to be cognizant and  alert to the possibilities and pitfalls. You cannot sleepwalk your way to becoming a  leader. As Neil de Grasse Tyson one of my favorite physicists once said the Universe is under  no obligation to make sense to you. Richard Dawkins says The universe doesn't owe us  condolence  or  consolation;  it  doesn't  owe  us  a  nice  warm  feeling  inside.  Similarly,  the  ET world is also under no obligation to do something for you. Instead, it is up to  you to pull yourself up and move things forward with diligence, dedication, and  commitment. In the ET scenario, your exposure makes it easier for you to move ahead in your  leadership journey faster. Here are a few pieces of advice for you to remember:       Situational awareness: It is easy to get deeply involved in your daily chores  and forget your larger growth goals or other goals that are at a rather high  level. Situational awareness involves 3 components viz., where we are, what  we are doing, and where we need to be. Unless you are aware at all times  about the need to link these three components, your leadership journey will  be incomplete.     Ask questions: Get as much clarity from all stakeholders as possible before      making any commitment.                    Speak your mind but be polite and respect other people's opinions.    A certain level of dissent is needed in teams. In one of the ET start-ups, I was  working for I was working with a team where we had few if any differences  of opinion on anything. Finally, we had to pull in others to evaluate our  approach and become a sort of devil's advocate. We just wanted to see if we  were on the right track or we were just covering each other's blind spots.     A  team  that  eats  together  stays  together:  Team  lunches  and  dinners  are  not just a want but a need. You will be surprised by the camaraderie that  develops  between  people  who  hang  out  together.  Use  such  occasions  as  opportunities to understand people better and to gel with the. Even a coffee  break can make a difference. Leaders always create opportunities be it in  understanding people or in understanding their circumstances.    Stay in touch and give without any expectation: Now this might sound  a bit spiritual but this is a very important point none the less. Don't build  networks for leveraging them when you need them. Instead, stay engaged  with them and see how you can contribute in some way to what they are  doing or trying to achieve. This is the best way to learn as well     Grab opportunities: Either you succeed or you learn. Either way, you will   come out a winner   Building Your Leadership Capabilities      209                        Volunteer: Get associated with a social cause. Not for boasting about it but  for  your  own  personal  and  professional  development.  More  importantly,  because the world needs it.     Have a hobby.    Teach when you can: no leader can sustain their leadership skills if they  don't share and pay forward. You never know who you will be inspiring  until you start engaging people who need your inputs in some way.     Show that you care: A leader without empathy can never be a leader. They  can be good managers and supervisors but they can never be a good leader.    Go easy on yourself: Pat yourself on the back. Especially when things are   not going well for you. Never be emotionally drained.     Don't push people, inspire them instead.    See the greater common good in every technology and work you are getting  associated with. In my first IoT project, we were working on wrapping a  layer of messaging around a student safety solution. Throughout the project,  I  was  imaging  children  going  to  schools  returning  home  safely  to  their  parents. Similarly, in other projects, I could see the end-users who were not  my immediate customers drawing benefits from our work.  No chapter on leadership will be complete without knowing what a bad leader  looks like. Well, we have all encountered them in some form in our lives. So here are  a few differences between good leaders and bad ones. Though in real terms there  is nothing like a bad leader. You can never be a leader if you are not able to inspire  people. But for purposes of understanding, let us assume that there is a group that  has certain traits that make them bad leaders:  Trait   People   Confidence  Good Leaders  Inspire people, act with a vision, and  strive  to  be  inclusive.  Place  people  above  everything  else.  Inspire  and  motivate people to get things done.  Secure.  Invested  teams  and  their  skills.  Confident  but  not  arrogant or brash.  their   in   Relationships  Have  positive   interactions  with   those around them  They  worry  about  colleagues  and  teammates  are  always  concerned  about their welfare    Worries  Not so good leaders  Place  deadlines  and  project  deliverables  over  the  interests  and well-being of people.  Insecure,  try  to  pull  people  down;  unable  to  inspire  people  so  rely  on  fear  or  other  tactics  to get work done. Unsure about  their skills. Should I call it out?  about   Only  worried  their  wellbeing  and  goals.  View  everyone else around as tools to  achieve their goals.    210      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Vision  Demeanor  Long term Radiate calm and composure  Outlook  Thankful   Short-sighted  Radiate  insecurity  and  are  generally abrasive personalities   Complaining   Table 14.2: Good vs. the not so good ones  this   Pointless greatness  In  their  book  The  Quantum  Universe,  authors Brian Cox  the one and only  and  Jeff  Foreshaw  speak  about  an  incident  involving  noted  New  Zealand  physist  Ernest  Rutherford,  who  discovered  the  atomic  nucleus.  A  man  who  was  never  shy of liberally using language rich in apt  metaphors, Rutherford was once driven to  frustration  by  a  self-important  official.  Expressing  his  angst,  the  no-nonsense  physist  described  individual  as  being like an Euclidean point: he has  position without magnitude. There  is  a  lesson  in  here  for  all  of  us.  Leadership is meaningless if it is of no use  to others around you in particular and the  society  in  general.  There  is  no  point  in  being a leader just to feed your narcissistic  tendencies.  Now  you  know  what  you  should  and  shouldn't  be.  This  will  give  you enough fodder for thought. See  which areas you need to work on to  become a better leader. In  conclusion,  many  avenues  will  come  your  way  in  the  ET  world.  It  will  be  up  to  you  to  leverage  those  opportunities  and  make  the  most  of it. Unless you are willing to take  charge  of  situations  and  take  on  challenges  head-on  your  leadership  journey  may  not  move  forward.  Be  inspired,  inspire  others,  and  grow  together. Leaders are always close to  people and people also feel a degree  of  proximity  to  people.  Give  them  enough reasons to walk the talk with  you without forcing them to do so. Leaders  are  remembered  long  after  people have retired from jobs or have  moved  on.  Managers  are  forgotten  faster than the time you took to read this chapter. The choice is yours as it always is  and will be. Conclusion Inclusive and vision-driven leadership is what the world needs right now. Be it  dealing with the pandemic or its fallout on people and economies, the world is waiting  for someone to take charge. Sometimes, by throwing challenges at us, life tests our  ability to rise, take charge, and lead the way. Those who take up such challenges  and solve them are rewarded with power and influence. They are bestowed the  capability to influence generations to come and to leave a rich legacy behind.   Building Your Leadership Capabilities      211  Even after they are physically gone, a part of them survives in the actions of those  they  have  inspired.  That's  what  true  leadership  is  about:  to  inspire  greatness  in  others. After all, one person cannot solve every problem out there. Your time to take  charge is now. Are you ready? Questions and answers 1.  What is the most important trait that a leader in the ET world should have?       Ans. Hard to put a finger on a single trait. Instead, we need to look at multiple   traits here. All of which are mentioned in this chapter  2.  What is the biggest hurdle that impairs our leadership journey?     Ans. Lack of a structured approach towards learning is one. Going from one  mistake or even success to another without learning is not a good way of  doing things in life.  3.  How do I know where I stand in my leadership journey?   Ans. Ask for feedback from your colleagues, leadership, vendors, and other  stakeholders you are working with. If needed, take anonymous feedback  so that you get a clearer picture of your position. Benchmarking yourself  against a role model is another way of doing it.  Is it essential to be a leader to continue in the ET?  4.    Ans. No, the choice is yours.                  212      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code   To Start-up or Not?      213  Chapter 15 To Start-up or  Not?  Introduction The world of start-ups seems to be an enticing one for many of us. The very idea  of working for yourself is inspiring enough to keep some awake at night. Like all  good things in life, starting a start-up is not just about working for yourself and  valuations. As any founder would tell you, it is more about getting your hands dirty  and putting in some extraordinary efforts to get things going sometimes you don't  even where you are headed till you reach. Sometimes you must correct your course  and sometimes you don't get a second chance. Structure In this chapter, you will learn whether you should walk your path and launch a  start-up, or are you better off working for an ET company. This chapter will try and  answer the following questions         What factors should I consider for making this decision?    What does it take to launch an ET start-up? We go in detail on this one   including how to put together a strong business plan.          What is the ideal time?    What pitfalls should I watch out for?   214      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code Objective By the end of this chapter, you will learn if you are ready to start something on your  own or you need to continue working for an established business. 15.1 More than an idea A start-up is always an exciting proposition at any point in life. For many it is all  about transforming an idea for others it is about solving a problem for some it may  be about being their boss and for many it may be a combination of these factors.  Outside your motivation, it is still something that excites and inspires. Before you jump into specifics, you need to understand how deep your motivation  is. Unless your motivation is sustainable, you will not be able to work on it, launch it,  or turn it into a success. Launching a start-up is hard work and just like everything  else that is good, it doesn't come without sweat and tears. It took us 5 years to move  our start-up from the conceptual stage to an actual launch but that is a different  story. No matter which domain you chose for your start-up, you will have to come  to terms with a few things. A new idea with the potential to change the world dies every single day while a new  one takes birth every day as well. Those of us who are used to changing companies  faster than they change their hairstyle could find the going tough in the start-up  world. Here are some of the factors that you need to consider before you make that  leap:  Profile one  Profile two  Kind of satisfied  Not at all satisfied  Yes  No  Factor  Job satisfaction Am  I  able  to  express  myself   creatively  technically or otherwise  completely at work? Do I believe in taking the initiative and seeing  things to closure? Do I like a stable job that pays me well? Do I always like to work with a large team to  do  things  in  a  structured  manner  with  well- defined goals and responsibilities?  Have I got an idea that I want to take to the  market?  Will  my  current  employer  gives  me  the  opportunity to take that idea to the market? Am I scared of failing? Am I a problem solver?   Sometimes  Yes Yes, always  Yes   Maybe  Sometimes Yes  Yes, mostly   No Sometimes,  not always   but   Yes  Yes  No Yes   To Start-up or Not?      215  Do I see opportunities where others don't? Could I work alone for a while to get my idea  off the ground? Where do I see myself in 5 years?  Yes No   Yes Yes  Work-life balance?  in  my   C-suite  company Is  important  but  not essential   Leading  my  own  company  Depends on what I  am doing or what  I intend to do  Table 15.1: Factors vs. profiles  Profile one belongs to a person who may not want to tread the start-up path. Profile  two comes closer to someone who might go on their sometime in the future. Again,  there  are  no  golden  rules  here.  If  profile  one  gets  disgruntled  and  wants  to  do  something on his or her own, things might change. 15.2 Where do you belong? A cabin or a  war room? If you see yourself at home in a cabin with a fancy designation, you might as well  stop reading this chapter here. Many of us fall in this category and for them; an  adventure ends with a project or an email appreciation. It's a mix of factors that  makes people risk-averse and that is one factor that makes a huge difference. In  a  world  that  is  becoming  increasingly  uncertain,  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  steady ship. Even in a routine 9-5 job, you will be taking risks with or without your  knowledge. Unless you are working for a firm where even the risks get buried or  decision making is turned into a layered collective affair where no single individual is  held responsible for anything that goes wrong. This is exactly what makes meetings  interesting.  Either  meeting  is  about  someone  taking  responsibility  for  getting  something done or about no one taking responsibility in which case a committee is  formed to get things done  as we often see in government establishments . Or  do  you  belong  to  a  war  room?  Working  with  a  mission-level  dedication  to  move your dream from the category fiction to non-fiction?  Attitude makes a huge  difference and so does your commitment and motivation. Many factors influence the  success of your mission. But if these three are in place, you have what it takes to at  the very least launch a start-up. A fire in your belly is not just optional but mandatory  you have to pull your inspiration from deep within and let it guide you at a surface  level when you start dealing with the everyday challenges of running a start-up. In  a world filled with distractions, if your motivations are not strong enough, you will  run out of energy long before you even enter the race.   216      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Before we even begin, let us answer a few questions:       The first and the most important question is do you have time for a venture?  Many of us get excited and jump on to new projects until we realize that  we have other pressing commitments and are hard-pressed for time. This is  even more of a problem when we are employed full-time and are trying to  launch a start-up while sitting comfortably in the shadow of a corporate job.  If the day job is a priority, then stick with it.                           Could you explain your business model, value proposition, and the problem  you are addressing in under 30 seconds  separately ? Unless you can do this,  a strong business model will not emerge.     Are you ready? From an environment where you have at the very least one  person who supports you, you will be pretty much on your own. So, are you  ready to give it your best in every possible situation without having anyone  to fall back on?     Funding? Do you have enough cash reserves to cover basic costs such as office  space, equipment, software, travel, and marketing expense?  Remember that  the things you take for granted in your current job will no longer be available  to you, remember that?     Who are your customers? Have you identified them?    Will your customers pay for your offering?    How are you going to familiarize your potential customers? You might even   have to create a whole new segment to cater to what you have launched.     Are you gutsy enough? It is going to be a rough journey in the initial few   years. Is it just about the glamor? Think again what is it that is making you walk  this path?      When I decided to tread the start-up path, I was keener on solving the problem than  anything else. The idea came and hit me one evening when I wasn't even thinking  of it.  The fact that this start-up would lead to a positive and qualitative difference in  people's lives was a huge source of motivation. But I could never decide on quitting  my full-time job to pursue my ambition. It never even occurred to me. One of my IIM-Bangalore professors had something that was often used to inform  my thinking. Never leave your day job until your start-up has reached a certain level of  stability. The stories you hear about the successes of others is just a drop in the ocean. For  every entrepreneur who had succeeded, many others couldn't and were forced into penury or  had to return to take up a job to make ends meet. It is never that rosy, but it isn't that gloomy a picture either. Instead what is important  is how focused you are and whether your idea is at the right time at the right place  or not.   To Start-up or Not?      217  15.3 How to know if the time is right? When start-ups fail, they are usually out of money, ideas, revenue streams, or were  not able to get the correct product-market fit. I have heard many start-up founders   some  of  whom  have  even  succeeded   say  that  their  offerings  didn't  resemble  anything close to what they had imagined when they started. When the start-up failure rate is around 90 percent, your chances of launching a  near-perfect start-up is almost close to zero. But if you get the timing right, you will  be able to reduce the chances of failure and this is something that can make or break  your start-up. As with everything else in life, timing is almost everything. In the mid- and late nineties, Satellite Television Asia Region or STAR TV, one of  Asia's  first  satellite-based  commercial  television  services  launched  a  radio  outfit  called Star Radio. The radio service was bundled along with television channels  and delivered to homes across Asia through cables that were a common sight in  countries such as India. You could tune in to the radio station on your television set  or even your radio set  I found this out when I was trying to see what happens when  I connect the cable cord to the antenna of my radio set. Even the cable guy didn't  know this was possible and it was never even advertised . The USP of Star Radio was crystal clear music delivered 24X7 across Asia. Unlike  the FM or Frequency Modulation stations that are still around, the transmission  was much clearer and there was a perceptible difference in quality. The service was  broadcast without RJs and their choice of music was just exceptional. Star Radio was  not a start-up in any sense. They were backed by a large media conglomerate with  deep pockets. Everything  was  going  well  till  one  day  an  announcement  came  that  Star  was  shutting down the radio service. The announcement came out of the blue. I am not  sure about the exact date, but it was sometime in July 1996 that Star Radio made its  final broadcast. In its final hour, the CEO came on the air and spoke about why they  were closing the shop. Star Radio, we felt was a concept ahead of its time. But I am confident that we will reappear  in one form or another in the future when the time is right. After his talk, the channel aired  music for an hour, and then it went silent. Never to return. It was an eerie feeling  and I remember the silence that fell in the room after they ceased broadcasting. It  was late night and I was listening in the dark. The radio set was still on, the LEDs  glowing, and the dial still stuck at the frequency where I used to receive the feed. But  unlike every other day, there was just silence all around. It was an ethereal moment. Was Star Radio ahead of its time? Well, no one knows the answer and we may never  know. But could someone have done something to prevent its demise? The answer  in my opinion is a big yes. Within a few years, World Space, an exclusive satellite- based radio station entered the Asian market and within a few years was able to    218      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  corner a huge chunk of the market and continued to exist for a while before it went  silent as well. World Space was doing well in India where it was making profits, but  it was not able to do well elsewhere so they had to shut down. So, to answer the previous question, if Star Radio had continued for a while, it could  have evolved a business model that could have helped it tide over the tough times  it was going through. Now, remember that we are talking about a time when the  internet had not made it to our homes. In homes that it was present, the speeds were  so slow that one could have spent a lifetime downloading a single movie. Besides  Star Radio was backed by a group that had deep pockets but lacked an appetite for  created a new market segment. There was a clear opportunity, but the owners of Star Radio didn't want to capitalize  on it, and timing was everything in this case as well. If Star Radio had stuck around  for a while, things could have been different. Chances are you have never heard  of Star Radio and a Google search doesn't even provide any hint of its existence.  They have buried its existence so well that you will not find any information on it  anywhere. Opportunities are time-bound and if you don't utilize them within the best use by  date, they just turn useless. If you are in too early, your customers may not be ready  for the product and if you have entered too late, you will be drowning in competition. Suppose you have come early, have a great product and people may develop a strong  need for it. If you have come early, you will have to work towards getting the market  ready for your offering. If you have ever been to the Consumer Electronics Show,  an annual event in Las Vegas that happens in January, you will see many start-ups  flashing interesting gadgets and concepts at the pilot stage with prototypes. Many  of these companies don't turn up the next year or sell the concept to another firm  and disappear. In the world of cybersecurity, if you have ever visited the RSA Conference in San  Francisco, again you will not see many companies returning every year. Thus, a  great idea doesn't always mean that you have solved all your problems. You will still  have work on making time work for you. Nowhere is this truer than in the world of  ET. With reduced innovation cycles, new products are launched faster than ever and  it is now easier to expand your feature set to solve a new problem that someone  else has discovered for you or even tweak your business model to dominate the  new competition.  When Netscape started dominating the browser war in the 90s,  Microsoft bundled the browser with its hugely popular OS and started giving it  away for free.  Netscape could never recover from this blow. No matter what you do, you cannot ignore the timing. But you can certainly pay  attention to other aspects of your business and increase your chances of success.    To Start-up or Not?      219  Unfortunately, there is no scientific way of determining if you are in the right time  period. Even if your product is selling well, things might change suddenly. If you are  not doing well, things could even improve suddenly. It is therefore impossible to say  for certain what the right timing looks like. So, the next best thing is to do a few things to increase the distance between you and  failure:       Pay attention to your partners and customers. Listen to them carefully and  hear what they are not saying. A customer survey may not help but someone  close to a customer who is using your product can reveal a lot.         Bring flavors of your offering with varied features and pricing so that you   don't leave any room for competition. If the market is not responding and you feel you are too early in the room,  keep  the  lights  on.  Run  your  business  at  a  minimum  level  to  keep  the  revenues coming so that you can use the time and money to build a better  product.     Extended the stealth\incubation period and use this time to keep studying      Solicit additional funding to sustain operations.    See if you can enter another market that might be more receptive.    Expand  R&D  to  see  if  you  can  lower  the  threshold  of  acceptance  by  the   the market.  customer.  15.4 Measuring risks and challenges As a next step, you must assess the risks you will face in the market or from a supply  chain or even an operational standpoint. To begin with, you must identify these risks  and see if you have the capability to deal with them:         Capacity risk: What if you produce more than you can sell or vice versa?    Capability  risk:  What  if  your  start-up  is  unable  to  scale  to  meet  market   demands? What if the capabilities are not aligned to market needs?     Development risk: What if the product or offering is not developed in the   committed time period?     Design risk: What if your offerings do not meet the expectations of its end   users or some performance standards?     Economic risk: What if your start-up is sensitive to external economic factors  and some economic parameter doesn't work out the way you wanted it to?    Funding risk: What if the funding doesn't come at the right time or inadequate   volume?                               220      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                                     Economic  life  risk:  What  if  your  offerings  have  a  shorter  shelf  life  than   expected?     Policy legislative risk regulatory: What if the government changes policy   or enacts legislation that creates a barrier to success?     Maintenance risk: What if maintenance costs associated with assets drain   your resources?     Leadership competence risk: What if your management lacks the skillsets   and experience needed to operationalize your business plan?     Operational risk: What if operations cost more than anticipated?    Supply  risks:  What  if  your  supply  chain  doesn't  match  your  pricing  of      Research risk: What if the initial or subsequent data sets were derived using   quality requirements?  false assumptions?     Technology risk: What if the technology you are relying on turns obsolete or  the software that your business depends on stops receiving update support?    Competitive risk: What if competition leapfrogs ahead of you using some   factor to their advantage?  This list is not exhaustive and doesn't even come close to identifying the full set of  risks your start-up faces. This list is instead designed to give you a flavor of the risk  environment that you will have to navigate as you move along and establish your  start-up. 15.5 Drawing up your business plan Chances are that your ET start-up is working on a technology that not many people  understand. But your business plan should be simple enough and written in a manner  that articulates the core proposition and reflects clarity of thought and purpose. Let  us now spend a few lines in understanding why a business plan is helpful. Therefore, you should have a business plan:       To understand why you should be in business: Writing a business plan  helps you figure out the various dimensions of the idea specifically why it  should be allowed to turn into a full-fledged business in the first place.     To establish focus: Another essential element. To help you avoid thinking  and working on multiple aspects of the business idea especially those that  you shouldn't be worrying about now or ones that don't lead to revenue or  market traction.     To net funding: Yes, let's not forget the VCs and angel investors. We need   them, right? And they need you to come to them with a business plan.   To Start-up or Not?      221    Overview  executive summary       Attract partners or co-workers. So, what does a business plan look like? The format depends on what you are trying to highlight and convey. But no matter  what you want to say, the format should have these elements:           The opening lines should summarize the business plan for its audience.  Corporate descriptor    A high-level overview of the company including legal structure, offerings, the  background of key employees, key partners, sales approach, and summary  of the business, financial, and other goals deemed important.      Elevator pitch    Describing in under 250 words why someone should invest in\join or be   associated with your company          Offerings   A detailed description of your products and services, information on target  customers, channels of sales, and information on how your customers will  derive value from what you are selling or offering.       Analysis   Customer  and  market  analysis  contain  data  points  that  investors  will  be  interested  in.  You  will  need  to  back  your  market  expectations  with  data  including prospective customer segments, industry information including  statistics,  sales  and  marketing  data,  channel  viability  analysis,  and  a  comprehensive evaluation of your competitors' positioning, strengths, and  weaknesses. In case you don't have any competition explains how this is a  blue ocean field or highlights any areas that competition might exploit.      Management information    Dedicated space for highlighting organizational structure, responsibilities,   owner information, management team, board composition, advisors, etc.       Financial plan    You will have to work with finance professional to draw up this section  which includes financial statements, historical financial data, spend forecasts  for  the  next  five  years,  and  information  on  the  viability  of  business  and  investments.      Optional information: you can also add information on the mission and  vision of your company as well. Your mission statement should summarize                           222      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code             why your company is in existence and the vision statement should talk about  what your company intends to do.      Be as objective and focused as possible. This document is not a sale one so  the goal is not to sell something to someone but instead to figure out how  things will be done. Once you have completed this exercise, get someone  to review the plan for you. Preferably someone who has done something  similar before.     Testing the idea   Have you noticed it? Ideas are always exciting especially if they are your  own. We still have autocratic leaders in different parts of the world such as  North Korea for instance where despotic autocrat rules with an iron fist and  refuses to submit to the will of people. Other states get away with heinous  crimes such as refusing to cooperate on an investigation on the origins of a  pandemic within their borders.     So, you get an idea, it excites you and you think you have it all figured out.  If there were some way of knowing how many ideas get ditched every single  day, the number that emerges would be mind-boggling. Many ideas never  make it to daylight as in it occurs to people before they are going to bed and  are forgotten before dawn  which is why it is advisable to keep a journal .      Market    Capital    Competition    Long term viability    Funding     Road testing your idea eliminates such problems. It gives you the confidence to move  ahead or in some cases goes back to the drawing board and fixes bugs. Without  testing your idea, you will always find the going tough. Your idea must be assessed  against:             There are three questions that you need to answer before we go deeper:       The internet is a wonderful place to find all kinds of answers including those that  match your expectations so it should never be a primary channel for research. Instead  talk to suppliers, re-sellers, prospective customers, and others from the industry.  You don't always have to reveal your game plan to get answers.     Can I sell this offering profitably?    Can my business scale with this product?    Can someone outcompete me?  Insulation against downturn   To Start-up or Not?      223  You can even take up a proof of concept study with a limited number of customers  before you launch your start-up. For our start-up, we ran a 240-day proof of concept  project across locations. We ran multiple rounds of validations and studies to check  and stress test each aspect of the business. The whole study was an eye-opener and  so many new facets came to the fore in each round. By the end of the pilot project,  our business model had evolved from targeting B2C customers to those in the B2B  space. 15.6 Study and understand the forces You need to comprehend the power of these five forces before you even thinking of  moving beyond the business plan:           Entry barriers: How easy or tough is it to corner a piece of the market pie?    The threat of substitution: How easy is it to replace or be replaced?    Power of suppliers: How resilient and open is your supply chain? Does one   vendor dominate your supply chain?          Buyer power: Can your buyers dictate terms to you?    Power of rivals: Track your competition and see who they are and what can   they do  Just like Netflix came out of nowhere and dislodged Blockbuster, you will also face  competition from forces that have not yet emerged on your radar. Is your business  model comprehensive enough to consider competitors who have not yet emerged?  While you are busy planning to work on your start-up, your competition may not  even be born. If you have done your homework, you will be able to take on such challenges and  even grow through them. 15.7 Finding your co-founder There  are  ample  studies  to  indicate  how  two  co-founders  are  better  than  one.  According to public policy analysts Startup Genome, startups will be able to raise  30% more investment, expand their customer base three times as fast, and be less  likely to scale too quickly, if there is more than one co-founder. So, it is apparent that  two fully invested founders are not just better than one but are greater than the sum  of their parts. So now that I have convinced you, let's move ahead and look at the most important  aspects that help in identifying good co-founders. Co-founders should ideally have  the following traits:       Something in common, a shared value or a principle to fall back on in case of   disagreements   224      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Trust    Confidence    Ability to call a spade a spade    Be able to find problems and solve them          Balanced  partners  drive  success.  In  many  cases,  founders  make  the  mistake  of  joining hands with someone who is exactly like them. Instead, it is advisable to find  someone with complementary skillsets. Like for instance, if you are a techie, find  someone who is a financial legal marketing sales wiz. Though it is not a bad idea  to have two co-founders with a similar skill set only in one condition which is that if  the idea is strong enough to walk on its own. In addition to having complementary skills, it is also important to bring onboard  people with varying personality traits. If you are an introvert, get an extrovert and  vice versa. This will help co-founders support each other in tough situations. You  can  scout  for  co-founders  online.  There  are  sites  such  as  FounderDating,  Founder2Be, and YouNoodle that you can use to find co-founders. If you are not keen  on  finding  them  online,  you  can  also  meet  them  at  events,  hackathons,  or  even  venture meet-ups. A close friend whose start-up is in the stealth mode right now told me an interesting  story. Her start-up connects pet parents with other pet parents for a specific reason.  When I started, I worked with 3 co-founders. But they were mostly focused on short term  goals and some were keen on me paying them something upfront to bring them on-board.  None of them identified with the cause that made me launch this start-up and so I had to  leave them. My current co-founder came on-board after hearing about the core idea behind  my start-up. As a pet parent, he could see the need for such a venture. I am not sure if all  founders are this lucky, she says. Finding a good founder is like finding a good partner in life. You get lucky sometimes and  if you are not lucky, well either you move on or your try and make the relationship work  depending on what your priorities are and what your attention span is, she adds. Right co-founders and employees can make or break a start-up. A large organization  with deep pockets can afford to make a series of mistakes and still be around to talk  about it. But in the start-up world, your first mistake may be your last one. In the ET  world, things are even more complicated as you must keep pace with the dynamics  of technology and the changing aspirations of people or businesses. When you are aiming for disruption, there cannot be a grey area between success  and failure and your co-founder s  will help determine the altitude your start-up  will rise to. So, make sure you have the best support available.   To Start-up or Not?      225  15.8 Finding the right revenue model The revenue model is an important aspect of your start-up. It will ensure that the  financial stability of your start-up is always maintained and that it is always run in  a sustainable manner. Revenue is the income received through the successful sale of  products or services. A revenue model helps your stakeholders and you understand  cash flow and associated needs. It helps your potential investors learn how you  intend  to  price  your  offerings  in  a  manner  that  maximizes  profitability  through  impactful marketing, sales, and other activities. To put together a viable revenue model, you need to be able to project revenue  estimates even if you haven't started making money yet. Forecasting revenue will  help you manage income better by understanding the sources and the best way to  tap them. There are two methods of forecasting. The first one is Top-down forecasting which  involves identifying your market, market segment, size of potential customer base,  and then extrapolating that data to come to the size of your potential revenue stream.  The bottom-down approach works by identifying variables that affect revenue. You  then figure out the spending needed to attain that revenue, tie it down to certain  goals and headcount. Following are the steps:       Choose the right approach: Needless to say, your revenue model should  cater to the unique needs of your business. For instance, in the ET world, you  will have to identify ways to monetize your R&D approach. Start by figuring  out where you are and where you need to be in terms of monetizing your  efforts. The projections may be exponential or linear depending on various  factors. You will have to factor in and call out risks and variables. Also, what  will be your proof points? Do you wish to start small, prove the viability of  your model, and then scale, or do you want to prove you, model, at scale?                 Focus on USP: Yes, even your revenue model should be able to demonstrate  your uniqueness and willingness to pay on behalf of the potential customers.    Looking  ahead,  see  how  your  potential  investors  will  see  your  revenue  model. Will it appeal to them? Can I use this model to identify a clutch of  potential investors  patient investors or otherwise ?     Project: Break-even time will be a big question in the minds of your potential  investors. They would also want to know as to when you will start making  money. Use data and scientific methods to come as close to the real number  as possible and be honest about it.     Take help: You can approach people who have done similar work in the past   to help you out. Many firms help early-stage start-ups for a fee.   226      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code              Sensitivity: Identify all variables that may impact your revenue model and  identify the sensitivity of each variable to your revenue projections. Play  with numbers to see how the projections change.     Dynamics: While the core framework and pillars of your revenue model  may not change, other aspects will change according to various market or  internal factors. You might even have to ditch the model completely in the  future if revenue streams change or dry up.     Figure out the mitigation strategies: To offset the variables that may stall  revenue or even stop it completely. You should have at least a couple of plans  for mitigating each risk factor.  15.9 Finding your dream team or first  employees Most ET start-ups have employees who have some level of experience and come with  proven expertise and skillsets. This helps eliminate the need to test their capabilities  or to handhold them at various times by others who are hard-pressed for time. But  that doesn't mean that start-ups don't hire interns.  In one of the start-ups I used to work for, we were an 18-member team in India. We  had interns work with us since day one. One reason for this was that we were on some  pathbreaking IoT projects and had at least a few employees who were experienced  and had the right combination of skills and attributes to help the company succeed. In the case of another start-up in the IoT space, the founder chose his team and it  included almost all people who had worked with him in the past. Unfortunately, as  he would later admit he didn't bring these people on board for their skills. Instead,  he brought them because they were people, he was comfortable working with.  Within less than a year, it became apparent that this was a big mistake. The employees  that the founder had hired formed a coterie around the founder and prevented him  from making decisions that were in the best interests of the company. Those close to  the founder got fancy titles such as head or 5 functional areas without having any  expertise, good salaries, and rights to put down any other employee not belonging  to their coterie.  Far from a dream team, this was a nightmare team for those who had come from  other organizations to work for this start-up. Attrition levels skyrocketed and soon  even  coterie  members  started  heading  out.  A  single  decision  was  taken  by  the  founder in bringing on-board his yes men turned the whole company into a shell. It  was a mistake from which the company never recovered.    To Start-up or Not?      227                            I haven't been tracking this company for a while, so I am not sure what became of  them. No matter what eventually happened, the whole approach the founder took  was wrong and he acted with his interests in mind rather those of his company.  Things to keep in mind while forming your dream team:       Hire self-starters who work with the assumption that you or anyone else   won't be around to even guide them. If  you  are  hiring  for  a  non-tech  position,  never  give  more  weightage  to  qualifications. Hire for skills instead.                For  tech  positions,  look  at  the  type  of  projects  they  have  done  during   graduation. That will tell you a lot about their motivations. Innovation is an innovation does. Nothing beats innovation that can be seen  rather than something that exists as at a potential level. Go for people who  can prove things.     People with fire in their bellies and a desire to do something extraordinary   are important. It is advisable to recruit freshers from your second year of operations. Things  should ideally stabilize before you bring them on board. It is essential to  hire freshers as they bring in new ideas, work patterns, and energy. I have  learned so many things from freshers and their energies and creativity rub  off on others as well.     Never hire in bulk as that would defeat the whole purpose of bringing in       champions.  freedom.     Problem-solving  should  not  just  be  a  luxury  but  instead,  it  should  be  a   prevalent trait among your teamsters.     No matter who you hire, they should be at home with technology.    Give  them  freedom  and  responsibility  and  see  what  they  do  with  that      Never put artificial rules such as dress code, work timings, etc. At one of the  start-ups I used to work with, my colleague in the HR team tried to pull a  fast one at a critical meeting where our senior leadership was in attendance.  He tried to get our CFO COO to say that he wants to put in place a dress  code by asking a question about it in a very stealthy way. The unflustered  COO replied, “In our head office we don't have a dress code, but I am yet  to see anyone coming in naked”.  The discussion ended there once and for  all and was never asked again. Needleless to say we never had a dress code  at any of our offices. [I have worked in companies where we had to dress  in formals  with a tie-on Mondays  five days a week and trust me it was  suffocating to come to the office dressed up to attend a multi-level marketing  salesmen convention. I hope no generation of officegoers should ever come  to the office in formals unless the occasion calls for it.   228      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                Hire people who connect with your idea. These people should get preference.    There is no harm in hiring relatives, classmates, or people you know. But a  different set of rules will apply to these people no matter how you deal with  them so be aware of this fact.     Never  hire  part-timers.  They  will  not  be  able  to  do  justice  to  your  start- up. You can, of course, talk to consultants on various aspects, but it is not  advisable to have part-timers on your payroll.     Tweak your hiring policy from time to time based on your learnings and   experience from past hiring processes.  Let me tell you something to underscore the importance of hiring the right people.  Beyond your success as a company, these folks will also establish your core culture  so make you get people who can turn your company into a fun, innovation-driven,  efficient, and productive a place. 15.10 Figuring out the legal aspects This includes registering your start-up, understanding which rules and regulations  apply, the taxation regime, the compliance requirements, and more. To begin with,  you can avail of the services of a legal firm or lawyer to take you through the process.  You can go for a full-fledged legal team later. In the emerging tech world, technologies are often a subject of regulatory intervention.  For instance, connectivity and data side of IoT, several aspects of AI, drones and  certain technologies used in healthiest are all areas where several governments have  already framed regulations or are in the process of doing so. Staying  ahead  of  or  at  least  compliant  with  the  rules  is  essential  to  staying  competitively relevant. If your start-up is unable to do so, penalties may be levied,  and potential legal issues could result in that could put you behind your competition.  The  prevailing  regulatory  frameworks  should  inform  your  broader  strategy  and  approach to various markets. It is therefore important to periodically renew your  knowledge about regulatory changes. With the Coronavirus pandemic playing out, governments are busy dealing with the  human and economic costs of the outbreak. Thus, this year  2020  may not see too  much across the board legal action on the regulatory front in several countries. But  there will still be new regulation enacted in the healthcare domain that will have a  bearing on start-ups in one way or another. With social distancing and other norms  coming in the picture does get complicated. The focus on fighting the virus is keeping governments and regulators occupied.  Consequently, start-ups may be tempted to believe that they can march into new  areas with untested technologies without having to deal with complex legal and  compliance mandates. This may not be true.   To Start-up or Not?      229  In heavily regulated countries, governments will frame laws to control the use of  technology  without  thinking  a  bit  about  its  fallout  on  start-ups.  The  problem  is  that start-ups do not have a voice in many countries. In some places, start-ups do  lobby but then they focus on areas concerning their operations. On the other end of  the spectrum, in countries of the EU for instance, where the laws are slightly more  favorable for start-ups, it ceases to become an entry barrier paving the way for faster  entry of start-ups into the sector or segment. So, it cuts both ways but still, you only need to focus on complying with the rules  and regulations in your immediate legal jurisdiction. But at the same time, keep a  plan ready in case of rules change suddenly. If anything, you should hedge your  start-up by expanding operations into geographies that a more liberal regulatory  regime. In case you can't do that, you should invest in measures to limit the impact  of regulatory changes. A few policy aspects that could hit your start-up include:           These areas are the ones that will attract plenty of regulatory attention in the future  and therefore you need to keep an eye on them. If your start-up is operating in  a  developing  country,  then  chances  are  that  you  are  in  a  dynamic  regulatory  environment.  In  many  developing  countries,  there  is  no  policy  continuity  even  when the same political outfit returns to power. This adds to the confusion. In some  countries, start-ups were asked to cough up new taxes in 2019 and this came out of  the blue without any warning whatsoever. In some countries, start-ups are not treated at par with small and medium businesses   SMBs  and are therefore more prone to regulatory gymnastics. Though it also must  be said that sometimes start-ups get away with a lot more than SMBs. I am all for  SMBs and start-ups receiving similar policy attention and continuity as both are  crucial for the health of economies. My recommendation in this regard is:       Changes in taxation    Modification of tariffs and trade policies    Measures like GDPR    Amendment of employment regulations    Acts such as the Affordable Care Act in the US     For governments to ensure continuity of policies when it comes to regulating   start-ups and SMBs           Avoid policy shocks: start-ups and SMBs should be given enough time to  adapt to new legislation. Especially those that could affect their margins or  could make their operating environment less attractive     Start-ups and SMBs working to solve problems around health and sanitation,  sustainable development, defense, education, and wildlife protection should  be given suitable incentives   230      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                   Educational  curriculum  to  suitably  amended  to  introduce  the  concept  of  entrepreneurship early on and inspire students to ideate, innovate, and turn  into entrepreneurs.     Loosen the arbitration regime.    Make it less painful to fail. Chapter 11: Becoming a Thought Leader cases should   be handled in a way that reduces the pain for everyone.  15.11 Funding There are many reasons why start-ups look for funding options from outside. In  many countries, start-ups find it hard to get loans from banks or established financial  institutions. In case they do, the terms will be quite unfavorable and there is less  scope for negotiation. Capital is the lifeblood of a start-up so even if it means that the  founders will have to forego some level of ownership, they will still go ahead and  get capital infusion from outside. Investors come in many shapes and forms. They could be formal investors such as  angel investors or venture capitalists or informal ones such as family members or  friends. For purposes of understanding, it is essential to differentiate angel investors  and VCs. The two are often confused. A VC fund is often an investment vehicle for a group of investors. Therefore, there  will be very high levels of diligence and scrutiny of your business before they invest.  VC investments are handled more professionally, and they will be asking you for  documentation regularly. An angel investor, on the other hand, is someone who invests their own money in  your business. To that effect, even family members can be angel investors. Unless the  person involved is diligent and methodical, your start-up may not be scrutinized to  the same extent as that done by a VC. Now that that is out of the way, let us look at some ways in which you can raise  funds for your start-up:       Crowdfunding: Popular crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter have opened  a whole new world of funding for your start-up. So how does Kickstarter  work? To begin with, Kickstarter is a platform for everything that needs  funding includes movies, music, art, games, and even technology.    Kickstarter  is  a  funding  platform  for  creative  projects.  Everything  from  film,  games,  and  music  to  art,  design,  and  technology.  Kickstarter  is  full  of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative projects that are brought to life  through the direct support of others.    So, you will have to go and open a project on the website and set a funding  goal and deadline. The project is then given visibility across the platform    To Start-up or Not?      231                    and people like, they will pledge their money for the project. If the project  manages to reach its funding goal, all those who have pledged their money  are charged through their credit cards after the expiry of the time set. If the  project fails to meet its funding goals, no one is charged. Kickstarter gets a  neat 5 percent commission on the funds collected.    The best part is that you don't lose ownership of the project and you don't  have to shell out equity to the backers. Instead, they are supporting a project  they can relate to or for some other reason feel needs to be backed. Don't  forget the tax implications though.      Venture capital: You cannot approach a VC until you have set your house  in order. Just like companies must do a lot of paperwork and put a lot of  processes  in  place  before  they  are  listed  on  a  stock  exchange,  a  start-up  must do something similar before a founder can approach a VC and ask for  funding. VC funding is a bit rarer and is more process-driven.     Angel investors: You need to have plenty of contacts to get this going. You  will also have to chase potential investors to get them to first listen to you  and invest. Angel investors may look for all kinds of parameters before they  decide to part with their money and these parameters vary.     Family  and  friends:  Yes,  if  you  are  willing  to  bring  them  on  board  as  investors, you may find this a slightly easier thing to do. But then there are  pitfalls as you may not get a very structured interest as you would have from  a VC or an angel investor.         Enterprises and businesses: Yes, those who are plush with funds may fund  your venture especially if they have an incubator or have executives who can  chip in.     Governments: Yes, some countries do run programs to support start-ups   with soft loans. Industry bodies: Worth a shot. Some bodies do run incubators or programs  to support start-ups.         Philanthropists: If your start-up is doing something that benefits society.    Let's now look at some of the dos and don'ts associated with funding:       Customize:  Never  use  templatized  emails  and  business  plans  while  communicating  with  potential  investors.  Even  if  you  can  communicate  value, you may end up committing silly mistakes that might end up hurting  your chances. Instead, look at past investment patterns of your prospective  investors and link your start-up to that or better yet look at connecting with  the common thread that binds all their investments and see if you can pull  something out of your hat.   232      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                                   Remember investors have other things to do and are not waiting for your   email so make sure you value their time and attention. Investigate: Figure out the type of people or firms who would invest in your  venture, how do will you touch base with them and what pitch will you  give? If you are talking to friends and family, just convey your business plan  and see if they are interested rather than asking them for money right away.   When it comes to angel investors, make sure you identify your targets with  due diligence before reaching out. Zero in on a few angel investors or even  groups that would deploy the funds needed to match your requirement in  your region.    Angel  groups  and  individual  investors  have  unique  tastes  and  personas  so you will be better off if you build angel personas and target them. Look  especially at their preferences in terms of where they invest, the stage of  investments, and the amount. Many have websites so that makes your task a  bit easier. Some of them do list their preferences on their websites or on their  social handles.    They may not want to deal with you if you are not falling into their category.  You should know that and not approach angel investors just for the heck of  it. You may be tagged as a fund scammer or in some other manner that might  hurt your chances forever. You can also visit sites that list out specific advice  on dealing with angel investors or groups. You can use social media to solicit  advice as well provided you are ready to reveal your plans to some extent.     Don't buy any databases: Yes, that's a scam. There are a lot of scammers  out there who claim to sell databases with over 80 percent accuracy or even  more.  Not  only  is  this  an  unethical  practice,  but  the  databases  you  have  bought also may not even contain accurate numbers and even if they do, the  people associated with those numbers may have ditched that number long  back because of spam calls or emails. There are even firms that promise to  connect you with angel investors or VCs. Never believe them.     Be  focused:  Don't  do  too  many  things  in  parallel.  Instead,  focus  on  one  group of investors that you want to reach out to. Look at reaching out to  them via events they are speaking at, companies they have invested in, or  even LinkedIn.     Keep your elevator pitch ready: You never know when you will be needing  it. Be ready to describe your business in a sentence or two in a manner that  is intriguing and curiosity evoking. Do a Google search on preparing the  perfect pitch? You will get a lot of ideas. Once you are ready with the pitch  keep practicing it until you reach a stage of natural and effortless delivery.     A flyer will help: A video or a one-pager that summarizes your start-up and  the work it is doing will go a long way. It might grab the attention of the    To Start-up or Not?      233     right investor at the right time or connect you with someone who can help.   A video works even better as you can post it across social media and even  promote it.  If you don't want to do so, you can keep it private on sites like  YouTube and Vimeo.     Get the pitch deck ready as well: Don't wait till you get a call to have this  done. Your slide deck again will be a make or break for your start-up. There  are plenty of sites online that are giving you access to the pitch decks used  by successful start-ups like Airbnb and others. Use it to get ideas and design  your deck. Your  deck  should  reflect  your  value  proposition,  values,  mission,  vision,  business model, and everything that will help an investor make a positive  decision.  So, there you have it, now you have an idea of what it takes to get your start-up  going. This information is not complete I have left out aspects such as IP, shark  tanks, marketing and sales, management, operations, measurement KPIs, measuring  the strength of your motivation, and many other factors which are also important.  I wanted to give you a bird's eye view. The challenges you will encounter on the  ground will be way more daunting than what it appears on paper. Even the best  start-ups go through lean and challenging phases that can drain the best of us. Having said that, if you are determined enough and ready to live up to the challenge,  there will be something in store for you. If nothing else, you will learn something to  help you in other areas of your life. To start-up or not? Should I work for a start-up or an established company? Now that you have seen  what it takes for you to get a start-up going you should be able to get an answer or  at least some idea of what the answer looks like. In an established company, you are given a paycheck to continue demonstrating  your loyalty and you do get some level of stability in your life. But with start-ups,  there is not even a single moment of rest and you are constantly on your toes. Long before your IPO, you must learn how to handle your investors. Till a few weeks  back, we had a venture investor who was investing in nearly every second start-up  out there with a few strings. But thanks to the downturn caused by Covid-19 and  the belligerent behavior of a co-working start-up this investor has decided to go soft  on future investments. The news from the front is that they are also asking some  tough questions to the start-ups they are already funding and are even making some  management changes as well in case they are not comfortable with the people at the  helm.   234      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code One simple advice Some of us are quite determined to start a start-up even before we leave college.  The excitement is simply too much to contain. While it is good to start early, there is  another aspect I want you to pay attention to. Having lived the corporate life and having seen the corporate life as well, my advice  for you is to experience both, if you can. Working for an enterprise large or small,  established or otherwise opens your mind to a few aspects that you wouldn't have  otherwise known or understood. If nothing, doing a short stint in an enterprise will  make you more determined to launch your venture faster and with more motivation. By doing this, you get into a win-win situation. If you get a chance to have a good  stint with an established company, then you can decide to either continue or still go  ahead on your own in which case, you can take the lessons you have learned into  your start-up and reduce the learning curve. On the other hand, if your stint is something that you wish to forget in a hurry, you  can still carry the lessons forward. If the stint was particularly bad, it can make you  stronger and more resolute in a manner of speaking to go on your own. But one  thing to remember here is that your core motivation for starting something shouldn't  be to run away from corporate life. If that is the case, you will run out of inspiration  faster than you can imagine. Let these guides you towards framing your core reason for starting a venture: I have seen or felt the problem so now I want to do something about it     I want to impact the lives of thousands or millions in a positive way I have an idea that the world deserves     I want to set an example for others to follow                   There are enough problems in the world, and I want to contribute to the   solution end rather than on the problem side        My start-up is not about me. It is instead about the people who would be   using my offering to get something done     My creative energies deserve an outlet than brings in a change    In the sixties and the seventies and even eighties way before many of you were  born, an entire generation was living in despair behind the Iron curtain in Europe,  craving for liberty and freedom of expression. It is the same despair that you see in  North Korea today where people are ready to face the bullet while taking a chance  to escape to freedom in South Korea rather than continue living under a regime that  curbs freedoms. Many generations lived under an iron fist with limited freedom and avenues to  do something that makes a difference to their lives and those of the society. Many    To Start-up or Not?      235  perished  silently  rebelling  against  the  system  and  were  silenced  by  guns  and  torture. It is impossible to imagine how many ideas died along with these voices  being  silenced.  How  many  entrepreneurs  and  other  game  changers  we  lost  to  collectivization for no-one's good. But thanks to a change of fortunes in a decade that brought down the Berlin wall,  ended the cold war, and saw the birth of many new states, things changed for the  better. When  the  Iron  curtain  crumbled,  it  unleashed  generational  energies  that  were  bottled up and led to the emergence of a new crop of individuals determined to  prove themselves. The nation of Estonia is a classic example of this evolution and  redirection of energies. As Estonia became independent, it started working towards  improving the quality of life for its people. The results are there for everyone to see. Estonia is today the most digital state on planet earth. It is working hard to now attract  people from all over the planet to come and work in that country and contribute to  their economy. It has its flaws but what we need to look at is how remarkably it has  done in a short period. Estonia is also considered a leader in the cybersecurity space  as they have been victims of large and targeted cyberattacks in the past. There have  been no terrorist attacks within Estonia though. Estonia is now an OECD country and has made tremendous strides in development  since its freedom. The Czech Republic is another country that has done remarkably  well for itself in a short period. When you don't have to deal with oppressive regimes and have the freedom to chart  your course, make use of it to create a better world for yourself and others. That is  the core promise that many emerging technologies hold. While there is a chance of  misuse by forces inimical to our species, the positives outweigh the negatives and so  grab the chance and capitalize on the opportunity. The reason why I told you about these countries and the Iron curtain is to show you  how bad things were and how good they became. If you don't have to fight for these  causes, you are already blessed as you have some spare bandwidth available to do  something. Don't let this chance go. If you are working for a company or owning  one, make sure you live up to your potential. Don't wait till you reach an age or  situation  where  those  opportunities  become  limited  in  some  way  curbing  your  ability to succeed. I hope you have got an answer to the question I asked at the beginning of this chapter  by now.   236      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code Conclusion Start-ups have given an avenue for excellence for those of us who wish to go beyond  the mundane and use their hard work to deliver results that are visible through  extreme ownership. There are no two ways about it. Running a start-up is not for  those who wish to go with the flow. But instead, it is for those who wish to disrupt,  take a new path, and are ready to persevere. So next time you get an idea, run it  through the filters I have given in this chapter and see if you have the stomach to  conquer. Questions and answers 1.        Ans. Yes, start small and start taking measured risks in small areas of your  life. Try investing a small sum of money in the stock market, try to take up  a role in a project that you are not confident of or even going on a trek. Do  something to come out of that shell. I am not asking you to take risks without  thinking. But instead evolve the process of thinking so that you can support  the risk, justify it, and even deal with any challenges that arise as you go  along.  I am not a born risk-taker. Can I do something about it?            2.  Are there other ways of launching a start-up? Like for instance without   leaving my current company?    Ans. Yes, you can do that by becoming an intrapreneur. Let us examine this   concept a bit. Intrapreneurs are entrepreneurs who work in a company, but they didn't  start it. They are also driven, ambitious, and accountable. Few differences  between the two are given in table three:     Intrapreneur   Entrepreneur Owns the company They  have  started  the  company themselves  May draw a salary. May report to an investor Reports  to  someone  within  the  company  in  most   Works in a company  They have started a new product line or a project that  has significant implications for the company's future.  Salaried   Backed by investors Fully  bears  involved    the  risks   cases  Backed by management or Line of Business Head  May not be so   Table 15.3: Entrepreneur vs. intrapreneur   To Start-up or Not?      237               So, if you are looking at working for an ET company and don't want to go  on your own, this is a good way of getting the best of both worlds. I would  encourage you to try it out. There are many examples of businesses starting  in a company and going to become big in the market. Alicia Ledlie was the  brains behind Wallmart launching the now famous in-store health clinics  within Walmart stores is one example. I know from experience that intrapreneurs bear a great responsibility. They  can do a world of good to the work culture of an organization. Intrapreneurs  bring in the much-needed change from within.     3.  Are ET start-ups different from their counterparts in the non-ET world?    Ans. Yes, there are some differences. As I have mentioned earlier, the technical  aspects of ET start-ups will be scrutinized in greater detail by regulatory  bodies   though  some  of  this  attention  has  not  come  yet  but  knowing  governments out there, we know that this scenario is not too far away.  ET  start-ups working in AI, IoT, healthcare, etc. will face more scrutiny. Because  of this, there will be changes in work culture and other aspects of the work  environment.      238      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code   Communications Skills: Getting it Right      239  Chapter 16 Communications  Skills: Getting it  Right  Introduction In this chapter, you will learn the importance of communication skills  if you haven't  figured that out yet  and we will work together to improve it. So, these are a few  things that we will learn in this chapter. So just like the chapters before it, the line  items mentioned below represent a high-level summary. You will have to read the  chapter fully to know what else has been baked in. Structure Here is what we will be focusing on in this chapter:      Why are communication skills important?    What exactly is it all about? Let's fix the myths             Working towards addressing these gaps Objective         Understand the importance of communication and use it as a differentiator     Identifying the chinks in your communications armor  Improve communication skills   240      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code 16.1 Information and communication In his book The Demon in the Machine, physicist Paul Davis talks about how nearly  2  billion  bits   more  than  the  information  contained  in  the  Library  of  Congress  in Washington D.C  of information is packed into a space that is a trillionth of a  matchhead in a single strand of DNA. All this goes to show just how deeply life is invested  in information. The book deals with the importance of information in evolution and  life across species on planet earth. He even offers thoughts on consciousness. Information is useless unless it is transmitted or intercepted in a manner of speaking.  During World War II, the cracking of the Enigma code was one of the reasons why  the Allied  forces  could  defeat  Germany  comprehensively.  Enigma  was  a  device  used by the German military to encode key messages during the war. The code for  this device was first broken by the Poles, working under the leadership of Marian  Rejewski, in the early 1930s. Enigma had a keyboard, one set of rotors, an alphabet ring, and connections all of  which could be configured by an operator. Encryption and decryption required two  sets of codes and there was a daily base code as well that changed every 24 hours.  There were about 52 billion combinations that changed every 24 hours making the  task of breaking the code an unimaginable challenge. However the code was broken and it provided the allied forces deep insights into  top-secret  communications  belonging  to  German  armed  forces  and  the  fact  that  the encryption was broken was never revealed to the Germans, thanks to series of  cunning maneuvers across the battlefield which made the Germans think they were  on top of things. Communication is the act of transferring information through various means. Ancient  humans used to mark their territory by leaving handprints in caves and places they  used to dwell  the hand stencil has been found in France, Australia, Indonesia, and  Spain. Animals use various means including body language to communicate their  mood and even plants communicate with each other  find out African acacias deal  with predators . Even bacteria communicate, by secreting specific signaling chemical  molecules. There is a reason why evolution has placed so much emphasis on communication. It  is the means to interact with the surroundings and the basic mode of engaging with  an organism's environment to ensure survival and the best possible exploitation of  the environmental conditions presented. The flow of energy can also be considered  as a form of information flow. In  human  beings,  communication  has  done  wonders  for  our  evolution.  By  providing us a means to exchange information, values, monetary units, and goods,  communication has helped us invest in the right aspects to expedite our evolution  as also expose new means of collaboration and competition.   Communications Skills: Getting it Right      241  Despite everyone understanding and acknowledging its importance, few invest in  developing it. Others harbor misconceptions and a few more are indifferent to it.  Overall this is not something for us to be proud of as a species. So, what are the  common problems associated with communication? Here are a few:         Low quality of communication.    The wrong focus of communication  targeting the wrong audience or using   the wrong messages or timing .     Lack of empathy for the audience.    Lack of understanding of the complexities associated with communication.    Spamming.    Lack of attention to details.    Limiting communication efforts to a single activity.            In the corporate world, good communication skills are often confused with good  presentation skills or good writing skills or simply the ability to convince someone.  Communication skills are essentially a mix of the above and more. You cannot be  a good communicator if you are just good at communicating across one medium.  Instead, you should be able to work across mediums to engage your audience and  retain their attention for the longest period. Retaining attention is a challenge for even the best communicator out there. Look  at the world around you and identify the events that are vying for your attention.  Even a decade and a half ago there were usually two or three news items that made  it to headlines but today there are over a dozen. In such an environment where  the average attention span is in single-digit seconds, your choices are limited. So,  what happens when the communications skills of people in high places are found  deficient? 16.2 Communication myths Noted  playwright  George  Bernard  Shaw  once  said,  the  single  biggest  problem  in  communication is the illusion that it has taken place. We live with such illusions and  bask  in  the  grandeur  of  imagining  that  we  have  been  able  to  communicate  our  ideas well and when things go bad, we place the person at the receiving end of the  communication for misunderstanding what we said. Here are some of the biggest communication myths that people live with:    If I speak well, I am a great communicator: It's a good talent to have. But  just because you don't speak well, doesn't mean that you can't be a good  communicator.  I  have  come  across  many  instances  where  good  speakers  were unable to make ideas stick to their audience. There have also been  instances where the orator was not a particularly great speaker but was able        242      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  to connect well with the audience to make things work. People might give  you an illusion of you being a great communicator just because you are in a  position of power and they want to be in your good books.     Noise is communication: Screaming, shouting, and drowning others doesn't  equate to communication. Unfortunately, an exception to this has emerged  in recent years. In politics, your ability to drown your opponent helps you  stay afloat and convince people that you have won the argument even if you  have used half-truths and even lies. Noise makes it harder for people to find  your core idea or signal.     Non-verbal  communication  is  90  percent  more  effective  than  verbal  communication:  Prof.  Albert  Mehrabian,  Professor  Emeritus  of  Psychology  at  the University of California, Los Angeles in his book Silent Messages: Implicit  Communication of Emotions and Attitudes talks about how 7 percent of meaning  is conveyed as spoken words, 38 percent in how we say it and 55 percent  of meaning is conveyed through body language. I am sure this ratio varies  according to various factors including time of day, topic, audience, and so  on.     Overcommunicating is always important: Not every aspect always needs  to be spoken about. Over-communication drowns important messages and  reduces the energy levels and sensitivity of the audience. In times of war or  during a crisis such as the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, it is important to  communicate frequently to highlight new information but if the information  is not received appropriately or creates confusion in the minds of people, you  need to step back and allow your audience time to understand and relate to.    Communications  is  about  sending  messages:  Wonder  why  so  many  of  your resumes never elicit a response from recruiters? The answer lies in your  inability to connect with them at some level. Sometimes people think they  are doing their best by just sending random messages in a spray and pray  manner. No one measures effectiveness by volume instead it is measured  by impact and if your communication is not creating an impact, you have a  problem to address.     Soliloquy is the essence of communication: This is a myth that is often  subscribed to by leaders of organizations and political parties. They feel that  their job is to preach and leave it at that. How many townhall events you  have attended have been truly interactive? I am not referring to the scripted  or non-scripted Q&A at the end of each event but instead to a session where  the  speaker  started  engaging  the  audience  from  minute  one.  Successful  communicators  keep  the  discussions  going  with  their  audience  without  derailing their speech.     You must be a genius or endowed with high IQ to speak well: This is not  true. Having higher levels of intelligence could in some situations create  challenges for the speaker.                     Communications Skills: Getting it Right      243           Communication  is  about  verbal  communication  alone:  Choosing  to  be  silent or looking the other way when someone is perceptibly entering your  line of sight also conveys a lot.     The impact of communication should always be immediate: This is not a  necessary condition. The impact of a speech someone made years ago can  still be felt in some parts of the world. Think of M K Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,  and  Martin  Luther  King.  Their  speeches  and  writings  still  resonate  and  inspire, and their lives are constantly examined and reexamined to gather  new insights into various subjects of relevance. Thus, their lives have been  rendered immortal waiting to influence generations to come who will read  their thoughts and ideas in the future.  16.3 Types of communication Communication can be segregated into various buckets based on factors such as  audience, outcome, the channel used, etc. Here are a few communication types listed according to the factor that influences  them the most:  Factor Audience  Type   Peer to peer  or others  Type  Leadership  Type Employee  Type  Type  Professional  Shareholder  Event-based Emergency  Disaster  Compliance Crisis   Channel Outcome  Social media e-mail Learning  educational    Outcome Type  Marketing Visual   Critical com- munication In-person Lawsuit   Election  communica- tion  Sales Verbal  Table 16.1: Types of communication    Written   Webinar  Cease and  desist   Diplomatic Copyright  protection   Non-verbal   16.4 The coronavirus case study When the Coronavirus pandemic broke out, we saw how a lack of communications  hampered the efforts to fight and contain the outbreak. If things had gone smoothly  and according to plan, we wouldn't be dealing with a crisis of this magnitude now.  Instead what played out is a tragedy of errors, beginning with the country where the  first case was reported.   244      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  It has been reported that Li Wenliang an ophthalmologist who worked at the Wuhan  Central Hospital had warned his colleagues and others via an instant messaging  platform group comprising of his former classmates about the medical record of a  patient who tested positive for SARS coronavirus. His post went viral and he soon  received a visit from the local cops who issued a written warning to him and was  made to promise that he will not repeat this folly ever again. He was made to sign  that letter. Towards the end of Jan 2020, Dr. Li went public with his experience at the police  station and his letter of admonition. Though the local cops tried to harass him again,  luckily the Chinese Supreme People's Court exonerated him and went on to thank  him. The court felt that because people believed what Li said, they started wearing  masks and using sanitizers. Which could have helped in reducing the number of  cases. Unfortunately,  Dr.  Li  contracted  Coronavirus  on  January  8th  and  his  condition  worsened by the first week of February. As his immune system weakened and he  soon began losing the battle against the virus. On February 7th, 2020 Li took his last  breath. One of the first Corona warriors, Li paid the ultimate price for being a model  healthcare worker. Doctor Li, you are a great doctor with a kind heart and good conscience. I hope you're at  peace, read the top comment under one of his posts. His death moved a nation and  the whole country and the healthcare fraternity around the world mourned his loss.  It was one of the earliest omens of the days to come but the world didn't pay heed  to it. Despite the courageous attempt by Dr. Li the local authorities at least initially  acted in the wrong direction by prosecuting the messenger. This also means that no attempt was made by the local authorities to address the issue  that Dr. Li had raised as there is no mention of it. The same scene was played out in  many countries where many people raised alarms on the potential of the pandemic,  but they were either dismissed or were not considered worthy of attention by the  media and in some cases even the government authorities. That is till the images of  army trucks being used to move the bodies of people who had succumbed to the  virus in Italy shook the world. Those images were soon forgotten as the lockdown started pinching economies and  people. Even sane voices like Elon Musk came out and asked for the lockdown to be  lifted as they felt that the economic impact of the lockdown would be worse than the  impact on the health of people. Again, we could take sides, claim that there was never a playbook to deal with a  global pandemic, or even say that some countries were still able to bring the outbreak  under control, etc. The truth remains that at the time of writing, 3,975,593 people  have been infected and 273893 people had succumbed to the virus globally.   Communications Skills: Getting it Right      245  These numbers clearly show that every instance of communication by an expert or a  whistleblower or someone who had the foresight was not taken seriously. We have  had heads of state visiting and shaking hands with patients without a mask. A clear  case of the communication levers not pulling in the right direction. But on the other  side, was the communication not effective enough for many people to understand  the gravity of the situation? As the world moves ahead and enters the new normal,  there will be plenty of time to reflect on this. The outbreak also showed some companies in a bad light as well. Even before the  full impact of the episode was felt, many of them announced that they were freezing  salaries and even laying off people. As the crisis deepened, communication teams  from various organizations tried to derive a semblance of sense  which is why you  saw plenty of work from home selfies and online meeting screenshots . No one had  imagined at that time that the pandemic was here to stay. As the lockdowns extended, many firms decided to use it to their advantage which is  when you started getting those hope you are safe emails as well as invites for webinars  and online sessions. The media houses went to town announcing that the recession had arrived. There  were only a few outlets that were focusing on positive news and there were quite a  few in a hurry to paint a grim picture  to get more eyeballs  of the outbreak. The  media  coverage  went  in  various  directions  reflecting  the  confusion  on  the  ground. There were reports on various cures, vaccines, prevention tips from experts,  questions on the figures put forth by governments. There were discussions, debates,  opinions,  counter  arguments,  conspiracy  theories,  tailored  narratives,  and  a  lot  more. No other event in the recent or history created a communication glut akin to  the one created by this pandemic. So now when we look back at how the pandemic panned out from a communications  perspective, we can delineate these phases:           On  some  days,  people  were  moving  across  all  these  phases  in  a  span  of  fewer  than 24 hours. Yes, things have become that dynamic now. Imagine being asked  to communicate in an environment where you are not even clear about the state of  mind of your audience? Will you be able to do justice to such a request? This  is  one  of  the  common  mistakes  that  people  commit  more  often  than  we  imagine. We are unable to figure out the state of mind of our audience before we         Confusion and disbelief    Anxiety    Acknowledgment    Resistance  Indifference   246      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  start communicating. Another common mistake is communicating without having  adequate data in hand. So many leaders across the world are guilty of this crime  and yes, it is a crime. This is exactly why we had people who drank chemicals just  because the president didn't articulate clearly that he was just thinking or rather  imagining out loud. It is one thing to promote your political leanings or the interests of those around you  and another to peddle falsehood. The power of communication is a critical one and  in the hands of a wrong person it can do more harm than good. Many dictators and  ruthless autocrats knew the power of communication very early in their life. Hitler  had  a  full-fledged  Minister  of  Propaganda.  He  was  invested  in  using  communication as a tool to further his rule and to crush opposition using deceptive  means.  He  did  succeed  to  a  large  extend.  Some  of  the  propaganda  and  mass  communication  or rather sentiment indoctrination  methods are still used today  by some dictators and theocratic regimes that thrive on limiting access to media,  unfavorable opinion, and the internet. Implications of the episode:         Belief in institutions, government, media, and public figures has hit a nadir    Since  the  official  narrative  changes  every  week,  people  are  now  leaning  towards conspiracy theory peddlers to help them understand what is going  on.     Rumor mongers and those who are encouraging belief in superstitions are      having a field day.           More fake news is generated now than ever, and way more than what fake   news busters can handle. Information overload is part of the new norm and the average attention span  of an individual will now be even lower.            Communication polarization is also part of the new norm. No matter how  useful the measure, people will still be split when it comes to supporting it. What  happened  in  Wuhan  mirrors  the  Chernobyl  event  to  a  large  extend.  Both  disasters were suppressed in some ways by the government before things went out  of control and the governments involved had to confess. What can poor communication lead to in a business environment? Effective communication is the oil in the gearbox that ensures the smooth functioning  of any business. It gets the work done, enables the exchange of information, and  helps employees' gel and work well together. In  companies  that  are  unable  to  provide  an  environment  that  fosters  better  communication or those where employees are lacking good communication skills,  the impact on business manifests in the short and long term. The worst part is that it    Communications Skills: Getting it Right      247  is impossible to contain the impact within the confines of your workplace. It instead  leaks out and creates problems for your business and customers. Many leaders have spoken about the need to keep employees happy so that they  can take care of customers well. But if the employees lack communication skills  no matter how well they manage their customers, things could go downhill faster  than one can imagine. During good times and bad times, with a chasm existing  between various teams within the organization and vertical and horizontal gaps  emerging, employees can feel disconnected leading to low job satisfaction, sub-par  performance, and engagement. Collaboration between teams goes down and thus  institutional efficiency goes down. This is especially true of organizations that harbor leaders who are less communicative  and are unable to articulate the organizational mission and vision clearly. Businesses  that fail to prioritize communication suffer from:       Bad  customer  service:  Low  employee  morale  creates  bad  conditions  for  employees  to  perform.  Employees  are  not  motivated  enough  to  engage  customers well and thereby the gap between the customer, the service and  the brand keeps on growing till it snaps In other situations, employees are not armed with enough information to help  customers. Customer satisfaction is tied directly to employee satisfaction.                           Low  productivity:  Employees  simply  don't  have  the  motivation  or  information to improve on processes or to do their jobs more effectively in  workplaces that have communication gaps.     More exits: Communications breakdown is the first sign of trouble. The next  sign would be employee exits. Employees often leave toxic environments  and places where there are less trust and communication. The word gets fast  in the market through company review sites and thereby, it becomes difficult  to find replacements.     More  leaves:  Workplaces  with  communication  issues  also  see  people   applying for more leaves or for working from home. Injuries and accidents: In places such as manufacturing plants, injuries, and  accidents could result from a lack of communication.    Less innovation and R&D: Such places will see employees working towards       sustaining a status quo rather than taking risks.   Such workplaces turn into bad places to be and to work and before you know it, the  people who work there turn less and less communicative thereby aggravating the  problem. Unless the management intervenes and makes some radical changes to  people, processes, and removes barriers to communication, things will remain the  same.   248      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  It is important to remember that such places may or may not demonstrate all the  problems listed above but people who work for such companies know how bad  things are. 16.5 Importance of communication in our  personal lives The  significance  of  communication  goes  beyond  holding  relationships  together.  Communication helps convey the context of a position that you have taken on a  matter to someone who is either impacted by it or has a stake in it. This is true about  communication in a business environment as well. Open communication fosters  trust and credibility while being secretive leads to suspicions and rumors. When  communication breaks down between people, relationships suffer, leading to gaps  in perception and the people involved in trade allegations. 16.6 Signs of bad communication skills Watch out for these signs to know if you are not a good communicator:       Body  language:  If  your  body  language  radiates  a  sense  of  constant  restlessness when someone else is speaking, you have work to do to improve  your communication skills. Inability to listen listening for the sake of speaking where you are waiting for  the other person to stop just because you have to say something.                Being distracted: If you are not paying attention to people who speak to you,   you will appear distracted and disconnected. Interrupting:  Not  allowing  the  other  person  to  finish  their  sentences  of  expressing a thought.     Expecting  someone  to  understand  you  without  expressing  yourself:  Without conveying something to someone, never expect them to understand  or identify with your position or something. People are not mind-readers,  you see.     Using harsh words or being abusive.    Avoiding conflict by holding back from expressing your opinion.    Being unrealistic in your expectations.    Not asking questions.    Being a narcissist: Unable to use empathy and be more understanding is a   bad thing.     Being a bully: Focusing on suppressing someone's idea.    Promoting only a certain line of thinking at the expense of others.                            Communications Skills: Getting it Right      249                                            Lacking clarity in expression.    Holding back facts relevant to the discussion.    Being temperamental.     Indulging in multi-tasking never helps. Only makes you lose touch with  reality and a sense of connection with those around you.     Not according priority to someone who wants to talk to you.    Wrong use of eyes: staring someone down or avoiding eye contact are both   bad.

If once you have sent an email, the communication part of the work is done  I will explain this in detail in a bit.      So now you know why some of us are not as good as we should be when it comes  to communication. It is very easy to be a bad communicator. It is almost an effortless  exercise. But it takes effort to be a good communicator and unlike what you might have  heard, no one is a born communicator. Children overall are better communicators  than adults. You will often find them use words, sounds, and expressions to convey  something and they often don't rest till you understand what they are trying to say. 16.7 Assessing your communication skills       How do you work towards building a team or building rapport with others   outside your team? o   I identify people. Then we work together to identify a goal and then  we figure out a collaborative way of doing it. I don't mind connecting  outside work hours, with team members and others in a casual dining  place. I identify the people, give them options, and then ask them to choose  and we are done. o  I just connected with people when I need them. o  Teams, what's that? I work alone all by myself.  o      How do you break down a complex proposition to explain it to an audience   that doesn't understand the context? o   I give them visual examples that they can relate to or at the very least  some examples to help them imagine. I narrate the proposition in a different way taking pauses in between  and clearing things as we move along.  o    250      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                                                               o  o   o   o  o  o   o  o  o   I bring them to a meeting and then we just discuss away.

I build a case for whatever I am trying to convince them on. I ask someone in my team to convince them. It's my way or the highway.     During a conflict, if you are marked in an email, do you hop in or watch from   the sidelines? o   I  meet  the  parties  involved  offline  and  try  to  convince  them  to  see  reason.

So, in the above exercise, if you have scored mostly 3s and 4s, you do have to work  on your communication skills. If you have scored 1s and 2s, then you are safe for  now but there is still room for improvement. You must have years of practice to become good at communicating. We often talk  about some politicians being good communicators. It is because they communicate  often, have large teams backing them, and giving them inputs on factors like the  mood of the people, and they also work on the messaging till such a time that it is  crafted to appeal to the target audience. The biggest experiments in communications  are often done by political parties during elections. This often dwarfs efforts by  communications  savvy  agencies  working  for  companies  in  the  FMCG  space  for  instance by miles.   Communications Skills: Getting it Right      253  If you look at the US elections, for instance, you can see how presidential campaigns  have evolved since the year 2000. All candidates have invested heavily in building  an image, projecting it, and making changes as they went along. They have also  presented  themselves  as  relatable  candidates  who  can  be  trusted  to  bring  good  tidings for every demographic out there. Since 2011, however, we can see campaigns being run on the theme of polarization  where a leader turbocharges a group of voters to ensure they turn up to vote for him  or her during the hustings. They also try to drown the opposition themes and leaders  in a din that is sustained via social media and televised messages and personalized  attacks on key leaders. Nationalism has become an essential theme of various political narratives. Countries  that were at the forefront of globalization and liberalization are now turning inward,  looking at ways to protect their economic and geopolitical interests. Such moves in  the political arena will also have an impact on the way we communicate in other  fields as well. The emergence of fake news and rumor-mongering on an industrial  scale  along  with  other  developments  are  already  working  being  the  scenes  to  gradually change the communications landscape. How will such developments influence the way we communicate?         The focus will be on providing instant facts and less verification.     If the news sounds aligned to someone's beliefs, they will be more acquiescent  to accept it as the truth.     Unless you communicate across mediums, you will be unable to make an            Nationalistic tendencies and related factors will cast a shadow on business   impact.  communications.  With social distancing becoming the new norm and with the proliferation of virtual  meeting apps, there will be other changes that will become apparent in the months to  come. As face to face conversations reduce and the dependency on apps and digital  communications increase, the chances of being misunderstood or communicating  with  less  efficiency  also  increase.  This  is  the  time  to  revisit  our  communication  practices and figure out how we can adapt to the new norm.

In  this  interaction,  Buffet  while  underscoring the importance of communication skills, says  At your age, the best way you can improve yourself  is  to  learn  to  communicate  better.  Your  results  in  life will be magnified if you can communicate them  better.  The  only  diploma  I  hang  in  my  office  is  the  communications diploma I got from Dale Carnegie in  1952. Without good communication skills, you won’t  be able to convince people to follow you, even though  you see over the mountain and they don’t. He refers to  communication skills as the most overlooked keys to success. According  to  a  Carnegie  Institute  of  Technology  study  15 percent of financial success comes from knowledge or  technical skills while the other 85 percent is directly linked  to one’s ability to communicate, negotiate, and lead.  The  world  is  changing  around  us  and  during  times  of  change  and  transition,  more  communication  than  usual is the norm. That,  however, doesn't mean  you have to spam your  target  demographic.  But  instead,  act  with  genuine  empathy  and  engage  with  a  sense  of  understanding.  The  bonds  created  during  such  times  often  last  more than those created  during the good times.  So,  those  who  wish  to  sharpen  their  communication  skills,  the time is now. 16.8 Understanding the fundamentals of  good communication A good communicator works at two levels. At one level she tries to understand the  content of the audience and connect with it and two she tries to identify the key  messages that resonate with the context and the audience. There is a third level as  which involves choosing the platform to deliver the message and I will return to that  in some time but for now, let us understand the challenges associated with the first  two levels. How many times have we felt that we were misunderstood by someone? More often  than we can imagine. In how many of those instances have we stepped back and  tried to fathom if the problem is with something, we have conveyed either willingly  or otherwise? Yes, communication involves two parties or more and everyone needs  to chip in to ensure that the right messages are conveyed and received. Communication  problems  arise  when  we  consider  someone's  immediate  communication context as an extrapolation of our own. Let me explain. A few years  back when I was working for a fintech company, we were in a meeting to discuss  new approaches for improving the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  for    Communications Skills: Getting it Right      255  A lot of folks in the meeting started talking about how we can highlight certain  features or even counter some messages that our competitors were using. Someone  quiet throughout the meeting then raised his voice and said why don't we begin by  identifying the pain points of the customer? It was then that wisdom dawned on the  rest of us. We went back to the drawing board immediately. Our value proposition  means nothing if we are unable to solve a problem for our customers and that is a  basic rule. Unfortunately, this is a mistake that many of us commit more often than  we realize. When we are too involved with some aspect of our daily lives, it becomes quite  difficult to relate to others and understand things from their perspective. Go back to  your college or even school days. Remember your favorite teachers and professors?  Why do you think they were your favorites? Was it just because they were able to  teach well? The best teachers were often those who we could relate to or used to either pay  individual attention to us, add a dash of humor, and teach using examples that  we could relate to. They used to talk in a language that would make us think and  remember. The not so good ones were those who used to treat us as a unit and teach  as if there was just one large kid in the class and we were all inside that kid. Later, when we left our academic lives and joined the corporate world, we started  getting  group  mails  from  all  quarters  most  of  which  seemed  addressed  to  an  unknown entity. In some cases, it was difficult to imagine what was being said to  whom and why. Most communication attempts even now are modeled on the news broadcast that  one used to see in the former Warsaw pact countries during the cold war. Bland,  emotionless,  energy  deficient,  grey,  task-focused   rather  than  audience-oriented ,  and simply unrelatable, these news capsules were designed to ensure the audience  only heard and saw what the heads of state or politburos wanted them to. It was a  sheer imagination killer. How  many  times  have  we  attended  presentations  that  were  simply  devoid  of  life? The endless torrent of slides overflowing with content and data cramped like  sardines into every possible and impossible pixel of space. The data is a sensory  overload while the bad presenter simply drained the energy of the audience.  If you  are unluckier, you will also be subjected to a word cloud of jargon imposed on the  audience just to convey the subject matter expertise of the presenter. Why do we do this? When we have ourselves been at the receiving end of bad  presentations and presenters, yet, why is it that we are unable to fix this problem  that we are such an integral part of? There are no clear answers, but one of these  reasons might be why we are unable to improve:       That we fear public speaking   256      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                       That we want our presentations to be bland so that no one goes into the   details     That we have never received any feedback on our presentation skills    That we didn't have time to prepare    That we are not motivated enough    That we never felt the importance of being a good speaker    That we feel it doesn't matter    That we may not love the job or our boss or someone in the audience    That  we  have  never  made  a  conscious  attempt  at  becoming  a  good   communicator     That it was never taught in schools or colleges    That we were never exposed to good speakers    That we treat all presentations the same way    That the audience doesn't matter for us as we have other priorities          These are just some of the points I could conjure. I am sure you can add a few things  to this list as well. But the question persists. Why? This is a question that has been bothering me for a while. I found the answer in one  of the books that I read a few years ago. Unfortunately, I have forgotten the name  of this eye-opener. So, this book talks about how most people think that any act of  communication is done to satisfy a need that the person who is communicating has.  Most people do not think about their  value to a person at the receiving end.  In terms of priorities, this is how the  hierarchy looks like from the point of  view of the presenter:    The authority theory      One  reason  why  many  of  us  see  presentations  or  even  speeches  as  an  opportunity  to  indulge  in  monologue  could  be  rooted  in  our  childhood.  Many  of us have grown in environments where  the speaker is often behind a curtain  such  as a television monitor  and is not directly  accessible. Some of us may therefore equate  a  chance  to  speak  with  a  chance  to  just  talk without paying any attention to the  audience.  The  speaker  will  thus  think  they are an authority and so others have  no  choice  but  to  submit  their  time  and  attention to him or her. I call this the theory of authority. Think  about it.     I  need  to  look  good  and  get  something done     My  colleagues\the  audience  should  think  I  am  a  subject  matter expert     Answer questions    Keep the audience engaged      So,  in  the  above  list,  keeping  the  audience  engaged  is  not  a  priority  for  most  of  us.  Many  of  us  don't  even  see  signs  of  audience  apathy  or  disconnect  and  continue  as  if  we    Communications Skills: Getting it Right      257     Restlessness    Fidgeting    Checking their phones    Looking away from you and staring at a random place often the walls    Lack of questions    Some just walk away  didn't observe that. The truth is that audience often gives you enough clues about  the state it is in. Have you ever noticed these signs in your audience?             If you have, you will know that you need to work on your public speaking skills. When  it  comes  to  writing,  things  are  even  worse.  In  their  bid  to  showcase  the  infiniteness of their vocabulary, all kinds of jargon and sentence configurations are  thrown in. Let the recipient be damned. How many times have you seen sentences  like can you revert to me? We need to get this done asap by tomorrow. Such sentences  that  are  grammatically  impure  sometime  impair  comprehension  and  add  to  the  confusion. A degree of impatience and insensitivity towards the audience is not just  apparent but it just hits you like a tornado hits a bay. Some of the common issues seen in email communication include:                             Nowadays, many teams have zoomed in on collaboration and video conferencing  tools  to  prevent  people  from  slacking  away  while  at  work.  These  tools  while  allowing  sessions  to  be  recorded  also  serve  to  enable  people  to  meet  virtually,  discuss, collaborate, and ideate in real-time. Hopefully, with such tools, reliance on  emails will reduce to a large extend. E-mails are not built for collaboration or even      Bad choice of the subject line.    Impersonal tone and greeting.    Too much text.    Using hard to decipher the language.    Using text from some other communication.    Unexplained attachments.    Liberal use of jargon.    Bad timing  sending emails after office hours .    Endless threads.    Being too stingy with words; one-liner mails.    Copying people who don't have to see those emails.    Changing the subject line and.    Not changing the subject line when new topics come up for discussion.    Sending too many emails.   258      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  communication. Instead, they are means of documenting an exchange which is why  many of us find it so tough to communicate over emails. E-mails  often  leave  room  for  doubt  and  leave  behind  a  feeling  of  incomplete  communication. That is why their role is highly communicative organizations is  diminishing. Not every piece of interaction is making its way into an email. Just like  passwords are becoming obsolete, email communication is also ripe for replacement. 16.9 Interpersonal communication When people are communicating in groups of two or more, even if they are sharing  the  same  space,  the  chances  of  a  miscommunication  remain  high.  These  are  the  common mistakes associated with this type of communication:       Blocking interrupting the other person: if you have entered a conversation   to force your opinion across, you are not focusing on communication            Not paying attention    Not listening    Letting your emotions or state of mind then decide your responses or even   the quality of exchange     Focusing on your life or experiences or opinion over others    Presenting strawman arguments    Attacking someone's reputation    Not showing empathy    Holding the conversation hostage to your perception    Listening to speak    Multi-tasking                Unfortunately,  many  of  us  are  not  even  aware  of  us  indulging  in  such  wanton  disrespect to our conversation partners. In a good conversation, people involved walk away feeling energized and better. Bad  conversations leave behind a bad taste and a sense of revulsion. Sometimes a single  bad encounter is enough for bad feelings to ferment for a prolonged period. How  many times have we heard of endless fights starting with a small misunderstanding  of what someone said? It is too common to ignore. We owe it to ourselves and to  others around us to put serious efforts into becoming good communicators. The  planet is already drowning in the din created by insensitive communicators.    Communications Skills: Getting it Right      259 16.10 Understanding why communications  break down more often than it should In  his  book  The  Irrational  Ape:  Why  Flawed  Logic  Puts  us  all  at  Risk  and  How  Critical Thinking Can Save the World author David Robert Grimes explain how our  understanding of a situation is clouded by our pre-formed perceptions, beliefs and  ideological subscriptions. Such positions are hard to move away from. David speaks  about how in an experiment, people holding liberal positions in the US were able  to solve certain ratios better when they suggested gun control prevented the crime. But when they were given data that suggested otherwise, their mathematical skills  abandoned  them,  and  they  gave  the  wrong  answers.  People  with  conservative  orientation and political beliefs exhibited the same pattern in reverse. On average,  those  with  better  mathematical  skills  were  likely  to  get  an  answer  correct  if  the  answer aligned with their ideological position on that subject.  This indicates that our  ability to reason and calculate is biased by our deeply held beliefs and ideological  influences. There is something called as motivated cognition. The term points to an unconscious  tendency of individuals to fit their information processing efforts to conclusions that  suit some end or goal. The mechanism that drives motivated cognition are diverse  but can be grouped into:       Biased search: Seeking information that validates an assumption you are   already holding.           Biased assimilation: Filtering out information that does not fit into your   idea of the goal you already have in mind. Identity protective cognition refers to an outright rejection of information  that could cause anxiety or stress.      We have all been there. With the internet search and social media giants working  to modify the information provided to us via the digital mediums, the problem  of motivated cognition has turned worse. In his book, The Filter Bubble, author Eli  Pariser describes how the search giants and social media companies are working to  provide us access to content that validates or is close to an ideological posture that I  hold  some of which I may not even be aware of . I consider such efforts a violation of my information rights. I would never want  someone else to decide what I should be reading, comprehending, talking about,  or promoting. Even if this means that I get exposed to theories and information  that is in direct contradiction to any position I hold now or will hold in the future.  On many topics, my position is fluid to put it succinctly, and often it reflects what  have I read lately. I am happy to keep my position fluid as that helps me have long  conversations with people on both sides of the debate. I consider that a privilege and    260      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  of course, my association with people I care about is much stronger and deeper than  ideological moorings and positions. Having someone act as a gatekeeper of information takes us back to the days of  the cold war where in some countries, the governments promoted censorship to  such an extent that even information of importance was not passed on to people  who could have benefited from it. The Chernobyl disaster is an example of such  censorship. Information of any kind belongs to the whole of mankind but yes it  would be unreasonable to expect nation-states to part with sensitive information  about  their  military  or  espionage  capabilities.  But  the  information  that  benefits  people should always be placed in the public domain. Whether such information  should be available for free or should be charged is a separate discussion that we  will not go into for now. We are therefore hostages to our positions on various subjects. When ideology gets  to influence something so basic and useful as mathematical calculations, imagine  what a deep impact it might be having on our communication skills. It won't be too  much of a stretch of the imagination to think that even our communication across  mediums is influenced by our position and most of it is not always apparent to us or  those who we are communicating with. You must have seen how new channels sometimes host heated debates and less than  civil discussions. Some of this has to do with biased anchoring and scripting but  sometimes, it is also about blind spots that exist in individuals who are unable to  look beyond such positions. Alois Brunner, a war criminal was an Austrian Schutzstaffel  SS  officer who worked as  Adolf Eichmann's assistant during the Second World War. Adolf Eichmann was one of  the key organizers of the Holocaust which involved the systematic state-sponsored  killing of Jews and others by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. Almost 6 million  people lost their lives to what is now considered as the most shameful episode of  genocide at unimaginable levels. Brunner has been held responsible for sending over 100,000 European Jews to ghettos  and concentration camps in eastern Europe. He was leading the Drancy internment  camp situated right outside Paris between June 1943 to August 1944, from which  nearly 24,000 people were deported. Brunner never showed any remorse to his acts  and he was never brought to justice. He died in Damascus in 2010 and was known  to be unrepentant till the end of his days. This shows how people live and die with the positions that they have acquired either  voluntarily or through forceful means. Humanity has paid a huge price for people  who have failed to see reason by listening to positions that were not aligned to their  own. The problem has been compounded by the arrival of social media which has  for the first-time connected people to millions effortlessly.   Communications Skills: Getting it Right      261  We  are  now  seeing  how  useful  mediums  such  as  Twitter  have  been  highjacked  by arguments fueled by differences in political leanings. The fuse is so short that  a nasty argument can pop up from anywhere and on any topic. In the world of  thermodynamics, it is possible to extract work when there is a temperature difference.  Unfortunately, however, no work happens when there is an opinion gradient as  people spend precious time trying to convince the other side on the strength of their  position. The heat generated in such arguments is wasted as the energy is simply  lost to the environment instead of being employed in doing something productive. Our ability to communicate is thus dependent on so many factors and it is easy to  lose track of them and the consequence is we keep wasting opportunities to improve  our communication skills or improve a situation through a positive contribution.  This is also why communication breakdowns are so common. No matter where you are or what you do, communication skills are very important.  Let us now look at this challenge in another way What is the biggest problem with  finding intelligent life on planets outside the earth? The simple answer is that we  haven't heard them or received replies to messages sent to extra-terrestrial locations  that have not fetched us a response yet. Thus, projects like the Search for Extra- Terrestrial  Intelligence  continue  looking  for  intelligent  beings  that  are  trying  to  communicate, just like us. But such an endeavor presents its own unique but fascinating challenges. Suppose  we did manage to receive an intelligent signal from a source that is about 100 million  light-years away. Thus, the message we received is approximately 100 million years  old. So, the question arises Is that civilization that sent that message still around?  Will they be around when we sent a reply? A few years ago, some scientists came out with a claim that if a civilization residing  over  65  million  light-years  away  were  to  look  at  the  earth,  they  could  see  the  dinosaurs roaming our planet  as they will be seeing the light that left earth over 65  million years ago when the dinosaurs were still around . This assumption has been proven false since then as the technology needed to enable  us to see an individual dinosaur is not around and will probably not be around as by  the time light travels such distances, there are no photons left to gather or resolve.  Thus, an alien astronomer may be able to see a 65-million-year-old light coming  from planet earth, but they won't be able to see dinosaurs. But who knows what kind of tech these aliens have? We may not even be able to  imagine the things they are capable of. What if they are at the very least able to see a  bright light emerging out of explosion that resulted from the asteroid colliding with  planet earth 65-66 million years ago? A fascinating thought indeed. There must be  some form of signature of this event lurking somewhere in the universe  disclaimer:  this is mere speculation and I am not an expert in physics especially of the extra- terrestrial kind .   262      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  The reason behind this 65-million-year-old journey is a very earthy one. Imagine  two galactic civilizations talking to each other. One sends a message and gets a reply  70 million years later. A reply is immediately sent but it takes 70 million years to  reach the target. Thus, the communication exchange between the two participants  though occurring at the speed of light is still slow enough to support a meaningful  conversation. Sometimes the gap created by our lack of communication skills or lack of motivation  is akin to the above example which almost borders on the lack of communication  skills turning into a handicap for both the initiator and the responder. Improving your communication skills This journey begins with an admission that you are not a good communicator. Many  of us get stuck at this level itself failing to understand that we still have a long way  to go. Like everything else, this takes practice and devotion. In this chapter, I have  tried to look at communication from various angles to make you understand the  importance of being a good communicator. The next part involves identifying areas for improvement so that you know where  you need to focus your attention and thoughts. Doing a big bang communications  improvement exercise is not advisable instead begin small with diligence and scale- up. Identify challenges at every level and address them as you go along. 16.11 Identifying the gaps Where people good communicators years ago when using communication channels  was a relatively expensive proposition? Well, we will never know. But what we do  know is that we are spoilt for choices today as far as mediums of communication go  but we are yet to become good communicators using those mediums. For purposes  of this chapter, let us understand how we will know if we have communication  blind spots that need to be addressed. To identify the chinks in our communication armor, start becoming more aware of  your environment and context. Every time you speak or write, watch every word,  sentence, and study the reaction it generates in your target audience. If possible, ask  for honest advice from people. Here are a few more things you can do to study your  communications quotient  CQ :       Pull out old emails that you have sent in the past and study them closely.  See if you can understand what you wanted to say and see if your sentences  were coherent and made contextual sense.     Talk to your colleagues and former batchmates or even relatives and see if      they can grade your CQ.   Communications Skills: Getting it Right      263                    The toughest audience to test your CQ is children see if you can talk to a   group of kids and hold their attention for a while.     Maintain a blog or take up some activity that exposes your CQ to a larger   audience. Again, study the reactions you get.     Most online newspapers and YouTube videos offer space for comments. Start  commenting and look at the kind of comments or reactions you get. Are they  aligned with what you wanted them to understand? But be warned, you  could also attract trolls.     Ask questions in meetings and webinars and see if the presenter or speaker   can understand you in one shot or do you have to explain things a bit.     Try giving subtitles to a movie or an episode of some series or something you   watch. See if you can capture the essence of dialogue in a few words.  By  doing  some  or  all  these  activities,  you  will  be  able  to  know  what  the  areas  for  improvement  are.  Once  you  know  the  gaps,  you  can  start  working  towards  addressing them. The shortcoming could be tactical as well like for instance you  may have a small attention span and are unable to hold your attention long enough  to understand someone and offer a coherent response. Another reason could be that your vocabulary is not good enough for you to express  yourself without pauses and fillers. Words such as, so, umm, correct, you know, like,  right and well are what is commonly called as crutch words. Often such words are  used when we wish to draw attention to a collected thought that will be expressed  soon. Sometimes, however, people use such words more often than needed making  people distracted and restless. Excess reliance on crutch words dilutes your core  message and can harm your flow and the audience may see them as unwelcome  interruptions. When you are speaking or writing, you need to structure your thoughts to make  it clear, easy to understand, and relate to and engaging. A pause in thoughts can  express itself as a crutch word in a speech or as an incoherent sentence or phrase  that seems out of place in written communication. It happens subtly in case of good  communicators, but the effect could be more prominent in someone who is still on  the learning curve. To deal with fillers, you need to do the following:         Prepare extensively for your speech to stay calm and composed.    Read as often as you can. They will expand your vocabulary so that you get   to choose from a bigger word bank.          Practice, practice, practice.    Focus on your core idea but make sure you don't lose track of the vehicle you  are using to carry it to your audience. For instance, you can turn your idea    264      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  into a story and make it more interesting or add some level of suspense to  keep your audience engaged.     Never react negatively to your audience in your mind as that will make your  audience even more restless without you even knowing what caused it in the  first place. If you get restless, your audience can and will sense it.     Humor and anecdotes help buy time in case you have lost a thought.

A good communicator is someone who knows at the  very least to some extent what the audience expects and uses that expectation to  deliver their narrative. Always remember, you are only a medium to communicate and it is the audience  that is showing its generosity by giving you a chance to do so. Public speaking is  a privilege and should be seen and treated in that manner. Once you embed this  thinking within you, you will be able to navigate speeches, presentations, emails, or  any other form of communication with ease.   Communications Skills: Getting it Right      265  16.12 Zooming into the ET world So how do communication efforts work in the ET world? Well most ET companies  have more stakeholders than people realize. So, you will have to do a lot of heavy  lifting to keep people engaged and informed. You will also be required to speak in  public forums, webinars, and other events to present a company position or sell your  products so you being a good communicator is not a matter of choice. I have given  some insights into this in previous chapters, so I won't be doing a repeat here, but  we still need to underscore the importance of communication skills in the ET world. Whether you are working for a known ET firm or a new one, you will still be wearing  many hats and trying to get many things done. Because of the nebulous nature of the  markets and customers in addition to product lifecycles that are not so well defined.  This means that your inputs will be called for across multiple functions. Your role  will be as fluid as it could be, and you will always be engaged with many teams  within and outside your organization so your communications skills should be top- notch and you should be able to get things moving. Let us now look at some ways you can improve your workplace communication  skills in an ET environment. This can be applied elsewhere as well. 16.12.1 Meetings Most people enter meeting with an agenda. While this might help structure the  whole exercise, it is more important to focus on the outcome. I have never been a fan  of meetings. I am not sure what your experience has been, but I have usually found  meetings to be a waste of time and energy. There are a few folks who enter and exit  meetings to show they are busy and hard at work. But I have never seen meetings  being used as a yardstick to measure performance. Have you? When you are communicating the meeting agenda, also identify and communicate  the expectations from the meeting. A sample is provided below: In this meeting, we will agree in 20 minutes on the best budgetary proposal for our new office Everything else should feed into this outcome. The clearer the outcome, the more  useful and productive the meeting will be. 16.12.2 Use data Wherever  possible,  communicate  with  data  points  and  research  that  back  your  stance. This will make your position stronger and make it easier for people to back  your approach. You will be surprised to learn how much data we waste each day.  From inputs from our colleagues to data shared by vendors and other stakeholders,  we often discard such data either because we were not paying attention, or we didn't  feel it was useful.   266      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  This is also why we should maintain a journal where we enter inputs we get or any  data that comes our way. 16.12.3 Respect other's time, attention and  position With  tight  deadlines  and  other  pressures  playing  on  our  minds,  we  are  all  just  waiting to let off some steam. Sometimes we do that and realize how wrong we  were in the first place. Resist the urge to counter someone without knowing facts.  Be a lawyer and a Zen rolled into one. Be mindful and respectful while placing your  position. Remember there is no harm in being wrong if you can learn from it. Remember this principle every time you communicate. Ask yourself these questions:           Am I respecting the recipient's time?    Have I understood what I need to say and how to say it?     Is this communication effort necessary now or should I wait till I have more  facts in hand?     Am I being respectful?    Did I miss out on anything?      It may not amount for much now  or so you may be tempted to feel  but as you rise  in your career, these questions can change the way your audience perceives you and  it will be a big part of your legacy. This is what is missing in the corporate world  today wherein everyone feels they must rise by standing on someone's shoulders.  Cant we rise by growing together? 16.12.3 Establish a communications baseline If you are invested in the power of effective communication, you will have to come  up  with  key  indicators  and  measures  of  progress  to  measure  success  or  failure.  Invest in developing a minimal communication effort baseline which means that  every project should invest a certain amount of effort in communications and should  also obtain results that can be measured. Here are a few examples. You can build on  them, discard them, or add other parameters:                 How many emails does it take to get something done?    Average meetings day and outcome    Number of instances of communication breakdown    Number of escalations    Feedback from customers ranking outbound communication    Feedback from other stakeholders audience   Communications Skills: Getting it Right      267     How many communications models do you use?    Self-assessment      16.12.4 Be decisive Unless  it  is  needed,  you  don't  have  to  expose  your  thought  process.  Instead,  focus on making decisions or helping someone in making decisions through your  communication  efforts.  You  can  also  measure  your  communication  strengths  by  evaluating each communication effort against this parameter. This  will  save  you  time  and  ensure  that  over  a  period,  the  whole  process  of  communication is streamlined across your organization. 16.12.5 Use communication resources effectively Every channel has its strength and weaknesses. Use them accordingly or in a blend to  maximize outcomes for your team or organization. Make sure everyone understands  which channel to use and at what time and for what duration. 16.12.6 Understand the reason behind a  communication effort Do you seek collaboration? Do you want to get people to think in a certain way? Do  you want your audience to do something? Identify that reason and work backward  from there. Start with your goal. If you start from your messaging, your chances of  success will reduce. 16.12.7 Test your communication skills often Many sites allow you to do this. I would recommend doing at least once every 3  days if you can. Go to Google and use the keyword test your communication skills  + corporate. Try them out and see if you get some tips to improve. 16.12.8 Seek professional help In case nothing works, try speaking to a professional communications coach. They  are many such folks out there who can help. Seek someone who can help you become  an effortless communicator rather than someone who simply polishes your skills. So, there you have it. You have now got a ringside view of how communications  should  be  handled  as  a  force  multiplier  for  your  career.  Someone  once  said,  No  matter what job you have in life, your success will be determined by 5% by your academic  credentials, 15% by your professional experiences, and 80% by your communication skills.    268      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  I am not sure of the author and the numbers, so I am not attributing it to anyone. 15  percent by your academic credentials, 25 percent by your professional experiences,  and 60 percent by your communication skills is the combination I would propose. No matter what the combination, you will still have to work on your communication  skills or be rendered redundant and be forced to watch all those wonderful projects  from the sidelines. The choice is yours. Conclusion Communication skills are essential if you have to grow into a leader. Unlike what  some folks tell you, no one is a born communicator. Just like other skills, it must be  worked on and sharpened. It is an investment that pays dividends throughout your  life in your personal and professional lives. Never make the mistake of neglecting  the importance of what will be a survival skill in the near future. Question and answers 1.    Is there an alternative to becoming a good communicator?   Ans. No. You have no other alternative if you must succeed    2.  What steps can I take in the short term to work on my communication   skills?    Ans. Read often and identify the areas needing work. Focus on one medium  at a time. For instance, work towards improving your written communication  skills and then look at others. It is a matter of prioritizing so that you don't  end up doing too many things in parallel. You can take up some of these  online tests to find out what area needs attention.    Keep  on  practicing  and  devote  at  least  an  hour  each  day  towards  doing   exercises to work on your communication skills.  3.   I am often misunderstood. Is this a problem with how I communicate or is  there a bigger problem that I am unaware of?    Ans. This is the first sign of the need to improve communication skills. More  will follow but if you have felt it, you will need to work towards fixing the  problem.  4.  You haven't spoken about politicians in this chapter. Was that a conscious   decision?    Ans. Yes. I don't include politicians as they are not good examples to emulate.  Now don't get me wrong. I am not saying they are bad or good. Political                         Communications Skills: Getting it Right      269  parties  and  politicians  operate  in  a  semi-natural  environment  wherein  leaders are constantly prodded by supporters or people who are invested  in them because they represent ideals that they believe in. Also, politicians,  these days take help from coaches and speech therapists and a range of other  enablers and they also have the luxury of having huge numbers of captive  audiences to listen to their oratory. Every aspect of their public behavior  and interaction is guided and manipulated to meet a certain playbook. They  are coached in oratory, body language, and even in how they present their  spouses. It's a synthetic world they reside in.    You don't have such factors working for you. So, it is advisable to start from  a realistic standpoint and deal with the challenges that you face or can relate  to. Thus, I have cited many physicists as people to emulate. These people  are the ones who face a herculean communication challenge every day of  their lives. Imagine explaining a concept like quantum entanglement or even  gravitational lensing to an audience that includes people like me? They don't  have access or do not use the services of professional coaches to the levels  that politicians do.    Despite  such  challenges,  these  people  can  convey  such  topics  with  flair,   clarity, and simplicity so I will always be in awe of them.    So, if you must look at someone to emulate, it should be these physicists,   mathematicians, or scientists.  5.  Any tips on how to become a good public speaker?   Ans. Here are a few:     Practice in front of a camera, record your sessions, and play it back   often.     Listen  to  good  communicators  like  Richard  Dawkins,  Neil  Degrasse  Tyson, Sean Carroll, Lisa Kaltenegger, Brian Cox, Trevor Noah, Brian Greene  or you can choose people who you feel are good and see how they  handle a topic and an audience.     Watch debates and presentations. One recommendation from my end  would  be  Intelligence  Squared  debates.  See  how  speakers  build  a  position and make people see things in their light.     Never give up on any opportunity to speak to an audience.    Finally,  make  sure  you  convey  something  that  adds  value  to  your   audience and never speaks for the sake of speaking.                              270      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code   Building a Personal Brand      271  Chapter 17 Building a  Personal  Brand  Introduction So, we have now reached an exciting phase of our journey together. Writing this  book has been an experience worth remembering and cherishing. If you would have  noticed, the last few chapters have more content than the previous ones. This is  because the chapters towards the end are more important from a career standpoint.  These chapters will hopefully be useful not just to those seeking a career in ET, but  others as well. This chapter looks at the art and science of personal branding. It outlines how you  can turn into a powerful brand that is able to make a statement and provoke a  positive sentiment in your audience with equal ease. Personal brands, unlike their  corporate counterparts, are way more relatable and tougher to build and sustain. Structure In this chapter, we will take a look at the various dimensions of building a personal  brand. Here are a few things we will explore:           What makes a personal brand?       Some engaging personal brands and what they have done well or otherwise  Identifying your Unique Selling Prepositions   272      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     Personal branding myths    How to build a personal brand?    Personal branding frameworks        Objective Personal branding is important for your career. Its significance cannot be understood  unless we do a deep dive into understanding its dimensions, methodologies, and  frameworks. So, where do we begin and how do we go out building a strong personal  brand and how can that help elevate your career to a new level? Let's find out. 17.1 Understanding personal branding  is       It   What is personal branding?      Personal  branding  is  about  creating  a higher level of awareness about you  and your value and expertise.     It is not about self-promotion  the  continual  process  of  establishing a pre-identified image or  impression in the minds of others about  you, your work and the attributes you  want to be associated with.  Do you know what you want to be  known  for?  This  is  the  question  I  often  ask  people  who  talk  about  being  famous.  It  takes  a  while  for  them  to  gather  their  thoughts  and  come back with an answer and often  the answers are slightly vague or do  not convey the true intentions of the  people answering this question. Frankly,  I  don't  have  the  answer  to  this question even today. But this is  something  to  chew  on.  Most  of  us  claim to be passionate, driven, and ambitious but at the core of what we claim to be  or wish to lie the answer to this very question. The answer will help us understand  the journey of personal branding. Because unless you answer this question or at the  very least, try to do so you will not be able to understand what your brand is all  about. Some of us associate personal branding with fame and wealth.  It is supposed to  come naturally with growth in both these attributes. Nothing can be farther from the  truth. Personal branding has its niche that may overlap with these two at times. It is  essential to consider personal branding in isolation for these reasons:       You may not be wealthy or famous and yet be a brand. Think of so many  people who are anonymously fighting for various social causes. They may  not be rich or famous but carry a strong personal brand.            Personal branding has a lot to do with expertise in an area.        It is more than just media appearances. It is about trust and credibility that can be transferred to some extent.   Building a Personal Brand      273  When your projection of who you want to be matched with the perception of the  audience you are connected to then you create a foundation for building a strong  personal brand. The term branding has a rather dark origin and I feel it should be  changed to something with a less evil context. So, what exactly is a personal brand? Personal Branding was coined by Tom Peters  in his 1997 book The Brand Called You. Reference to positioning oneself to be more  employable was made by Al Ries and Jack Trout in the book You can benefit by using  a positioning strategy to advance your career. Personal branding has been mentioned  in many books and papers under many names. A personal brand at the end of the  day is a statement of ownership made by an individual for a certain set of traits that  could be bundled together to characterize themselves. A personal brand could be  created with the active or passive intervention of the person at the center of it. Personal branding is about:       Showcasing those unique qualities that define and differentiate you from   within yourself,     Define your ability to help others or align with a greater purpose and    Finally, identifying the purpose of your brand    Understanding your key attributes and projecting them        Just like their corporate counterparts, authentic personal brands last longer while  fake personal brands are always at the risk of getting exposed at some point in time.  Authenticity is not just essential, it is mandatory. Authentic brands with a hint of  vulnerability and even insecurity can go a long way in generating traction with your  audience. Besides who wants to win through fakery? A brand often starts with an opinion. When that opinion gets amplified by all the  people you know or has influenced in some way that becomes your brand. Your  ideas,  reputation,  perceptions,  values,  outlook,  and  opinion  are  all  part  of  your  brand. People often use their brand either to meet their own goals or to further the  cause of a greater common good. In both situations, the brand spills over and by  association lends credibility or a personal attribute of the person involved to the  cause or even the product they are endorsing. 17.2 Why does it matter? Having a strong personal brand delivers results beyond helping you in your job  search. It can take your career to new heights by connecting you with the right  opportunities and right people and help you gain trust and build credibility in the  market and beyond. Some other benefits of having a strong personal brand include:    Control perception: Manage how people and institutions see you without    having to rely on some search engine to define who you are or what you do.   274      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                    Convey  interests:  It  helps  others  understand  what  matters  to  you  and  associate you with a certain idea, segment, theory, or interest. This will help  you find potential partners faster for collaboration or funding.     Helps  your  business:  Whether  you  are  on  your  own  or  working  for  an  employer, your company or brand can benefit by having a person with a  strong brand image. Many studies have shown that people often buy from or  trust companies whose senior executives have a strong personal brand that  radiates.     Trust:  People  trust  companies  that  present  employees  as  their  brand  champions. This increases brand exposure and sales. Often, cumulatively,  employees have more followers on social channels than the company they  work  for  this,  it  becomes  essential  for  brands  and  companies  to  rely  on  employees to help with their strategic growth goals.     Helps during a crisis: The trust that your brand has built can be used during   times of crisis to buy additional time to sort things out.     Grow professionally: It helps you identify areas for investment of attention   and resources so that you can grow faster and attain your potential.  In the earlier days, brands were convenient places for senior leaders to hide. People  like Richard Branson, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and many others changed this  flawed premise. These leaders have stepped outside traditional branding confines  to build personal brands that in many cases was bigger than the companies they  were primarily identified with. Branson deserves a special mention as he has truly  humanized the Virgin Group. His autobiography is one of the funniest ones I have  read, and this man's personality is a lot deeper and richer in real life than what  appears in the media or elsewhere. All the names mentioned in the previous paragraph evoke a certain sentiment and  story when their names are mentioned. That is what their brand is all about. It is  not just about creating relatable stories or managing your digital presence. A good  personal brand is a story within itself a story that continues to evolve in the right  direction with the active participation of the person involved. Bill Gates has a strong brand recall that extends beyond the tech world. His Gates  Foundation has been doing some remarkable work in the field of immunology and it  is said that he has been one of those seers who foresaw the Covid-19 outbreak years  before it happened. Gates' philanthropic work has become a trailblazer and even  those who didn't like him for what his company used to stand for years ago have  now come to like the Gates who now speaks like a seasoned healthcare expert. For someone who is doing so much for the world, you would expect him to have  a smaller number of detractors now that before. That's not the case though. A new  breed of detractor who claims he is working for benefactors like the New World  Order, Big Pharma, and some other shadowy groups. This is a narrative that Gates    Building a Personal Brand      275  has been unable to control despite the good work done by him and his foundation  in the past and continue to do. Now, look at someone like Oprah Winfrey. Forbes claims her net worth to be in  the range of USD 2.5 billion. Some are even viewing her as a potential presidential  candidate soon. The most interesting part of Oprah is the influence her brand carries.  She endorsed Obama for the presidential race in September 2006 way before anyone  was thinking of him as a serious candidate. It is said that her endorsement brought  nearly a million votes for him. It also helped his campaign gain momentum and  thanks to her, his book became the best seller for a while as well. Some would say that Oprah is a television celebrity, thus visibility and clout comes  naturally to her. That would however be an affront to the work she has done in  building and polishing her brand over the years. The downside of this is she giving a  voice and tons of credibility to dubious and unproven alternative medical practices.  She has in the past endorsed treatment methods that could be downright dangerous.  Pseudoscience got mainstreamed in her shows and some instances charlatans who  had as much to with medicine as some politicians have with honesty got an avenue  for promoting their snake oils and practices that could be proven as a sham in a  certified lab in minutes. Enough has been written about Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. Both are radical and  serial innovators, though there have been some personality flaws that many have  written about, you can't deny their legacy which will not go away anytime soon.  Highly vocal and clear about what they need from the world, both have carved  strong brands for themselves and the companies they founded. One of my favorite parts of his Jobs' biography by Walter Issacson is the part where  Gates heads to meet ailing Jobs who is now in the final stages of Cancer. The genius  that Issacson is, he captures that meeting in detail with a strong emotional cover.  Those of you who haven't read this book yet; I would recommend you read it soon.  It is refreshing and is one of the finest pieces of writing I have seen in a while. 17.3 Personal brand types Personal brands can be of many types based on various parameters. Primarily we  can categorize them as under:       Personality based: The charmers, the geeks, and those who have personalities  that  can  launch  1000  products  or  even  more.  Richard  Branson  is  a  classic  example  of  a  personality-driven  personal  brand.  These  are  flamboyant  and radiate warmth or some trait that the audience finds attractive. Most  celebrities fall under this category. They can be part of any campaign or  effort to sell almost anything and their charm rubs off on anything they get  associated with.   276      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code        Trait-based: These are subject matter experts like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris,  and Lisa Kaltenegger who have created a brand around knowledge and their  understanding of a subject. This is not to say that they are not charming, or  personality-driven. But the inherent strength of their brand comes from their  knowledge of a subject or a domain.     Position-based: CEOs and other C-level or leaders of various types come  under this category that includes folks who have risen to key positions and  are primarily known because of the position they hold.  Just three categories? Are there other ways of looking at personal brands? I am glad  you asked that question so here we go:       The news guru: These are people who keep you posted on what's going on  around the world. By being clued into the latest happenings around them,  they can share updates and even insights that are of use to others.     The politician: Many politicians have a strong personal brand as well. You      cannot get away from it.     Opinion churner: These are people who have an opinion about everything  under the sun. You will see many examples turning up in late-night news  segments  on  various  channels.  Folks  who  were  experts  in  the  trade  war  between the US and China became Covid-19 experts as soon as the pandemic  started wreaking havoc around the world.     The  promoter:  This  is  someone  who  works  to  promote  herself  or  others   through their channels or content.     The helper: This type of personal brand includes people who are the first  responders in any situation. They move into a crisis and use their faculties  and knowledge to help others     Networking king: This is the super networker whose networking skills can   connect people with other people or with opportunities.                 17.4 Misuse of personal brand A personal brand is prone to misuse. People sometimes extend their brand to endorse  ideas, people, and practices that can harm society. In some instances, a personal  brand can even be used to cheat people and that probably is as low as you can get. A few years ago, a bright young lady became the talk of Silicon Valley. She started a  company in her teens that claimed to reform blood testing like never. Her company  Theranos, a combination of Therapy and Diagnosis went on to raise $6 million in  just a year and in under a decade, her start-up was valued more than Uber at a cool  $9 billion. The board of Theranos included names like Henry Kissinger, William Perry,  and former CEOs Dick Kovacevich of Wells Fargo and Riley Bechtel of Bechtel.   Building a Personal Brand      277  The premise of Theranos was something of a Holy Grail in the world of biotech.  Holmes claimed that Theranos had developed a technology by which, a single drop  of blood from a person could be used to study multiple ailments. She claimed that  her goal was to allow people to do testing from their homes using easy to use the  equipment. Very soon Elizabeth Anne Holmes began to grace the cover pages of magazines like  Forbes, gave a TED talk, and even participated in a discussion hosted by Clinton  Global initiative. Her co-participants were none other than Bill Clinton and Jack Ma.  For a while, she had it all – name, fame, and a recognizable brand that was often  associated with everything right with millennial seeking to change the world. She  was even considered as the next Steve Jobs, a person she emulated in real life. Then one day, Wall Street Journal's John Carreyrou exposed her as a fraud and a cheat  to boot. Her claims of having developed the technology to do all kinds of testing  using a single drop of blood were all found to be nothing but an elaborate hoax.  The Securities and Exchange Commission of the US called it an elaborate, years-long  fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company's technology,  business, and financial performance. After becoming a brand and an inspiration for many, Holmes was reduced to a mere  shell of her former self as within a few months everything she had claimed was proven  to be nothing but a lie. She had even faked her voice to get her way in boardroom  meetings and beyond. She didn't make it any less tough for her sympathizers as she  was also found to be a bad boss. I would recommend Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in  a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou. It is among the top 10 books I have read in  2019 and is a must-read for everyone who is working for a startup or intends to work  for one. The book has enough information on warning signs that were missed by her  investors and everyone else. Holmes misused her brand to lie and commit fraud. In the process, she also left in  her wake a serious loss of credibility for anyone who wanted to genuinely create  a difference. I wanted to present this story upfront so that you are aware of what  you shouldn't be doing with a strong personal brand. Holmes is the wrong idol to  emulate but there are lessons from her story that we all need to imbibe:       Creating a strong personal brand for committing fraud is a despicable thing   to do.  other collapses as well.              Your reputation and your brand are both interlinked. Pull one down and the      Your brand should serve other purposes as well in addition to just being   used for selling or marketing something.     You will be pulled down from a pedestal in a zippy. Takes years to build a   brand but just days for one to come crumbling.   278      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code         If you don't do it well, the world will move on and you will be left to tend to  your wounds.  Look around you will see many stories of people who have used their personal  brand to bring attention to important causes that no one has heard about. Somewhere  down the road, you should have a strong cause to associate your brand with else  you are just creating a commodity with limited utility for the society. You don't have  to be a billionaire to help those in need. Always remember that. 17.5 Myths associated with personal  branding       Building a personal brand makes me an ego manic or a narcissist: a personal  brand should be an integral part of who you are and what you have to offer.  If a brand is all that you have to offer, without adding any real value to other  people, then yes it will enhance your narcissistic tendencies. On the other  hand, brands are driven by the need to create value for others uniquely, or if  you are using your brand to achieve a social goal or a mission that is in the  greater interest of mankind, your chances of turning into an ego manic are  low. Remember this. It is for the rich and famous only: no that is incorrect        Personal branding is different from professional branding: the core of who  you are which is also an important pillar of your personal branding efforts  should ideally be the same in any situation. You cannot be poles apart in  your personal and professional lives though people may change some of  their external behaviors once a while. Thus, your brand should be consistent  across platforms. That will add to your credibility.          Personal branding is about an image you create, and this is true to some  extent. But then the image should be an authentic one. It should not be a  fake, a dummy, or a placeholder. Thus, if you are focusing on building an  image for yourself, then you are turning into a politician. In the case of most  politicians, especially those in the current crop, carry a chasm wider than  the Grand Canyon when it comes to the image they project and who they  are in real life. This is why in situations where their true side is revealed  like in cases of scams or discretions in their personal lives, they apologize  when caught. If they weren't caught, they would have continued down the  path they had consciously chosen. So, don't be a politician. Instead, be a  professional someone can look up to.     A  personal  brand  could  negatively  impact  a  company  brand:  nothing  could be further from the truth. A strong personal brand also helps the other  brands the individual is associated with. A credible personal brand can also  lend some degree of credibility to a corporate brand they are associated with.         Building a Personal Brand      279                            Personal  branding  is  about  shouting  from  rooftops:  nope.  Instead,  it  is  about being who you are and living up to your brand promise. If your brand  is authentic, adds value to others and is seen in the right places at the right  time, you don't need to do any chest-pounding or screaming or any over the  top act to promote your brand. I can be a separate person on social media or a few other channels: no, you  can't, and you shouldn't. As I have said before personal brands are nothing  without clarity, consistency, and authenticity. If you feel you can give people  the slip-on one medium, you are highly mistaken. Nothing could be further  from the truth I don't need a personal brand; my work will speak for itself: your brand is  the medium through which your work will be heard. Your work cannot be  heard in a vacuum, remember that.        A personal brand is a vehicle to help you change jobs: this is not true and  never use your brand to jump ships. That's not what a personal brand is  meant for.  17.6 Dimensions of a personal brand At the core of the brand lies the essence of what you stand for. At the periphery lie  ideas, actions, and other aspects that either reinforce your core or are slightly moved  from it. Let me explain. Take a brand like Richard Branson:       At the core of his brand lie the fundamental values that define him more than  anything else. These values include a devil may care attitude, sense of fun  and adventure, authenticity, ability to take risks, and a sense of empathy for  those he works with     As you move away from this core you will see other aspects such as the  business side of Branson and his diplomatic side both of which he uses to  keep his business running.     As you move further away and reach the periphery, you will see more of  his diplomatic side and tactical activities such as public relations and other  methods he or his team uses to further his brand.  So, when given a specific task, Branson applies himself core first. Everything must  carry a signature of his which comes from his core values. You may or may not see  the peripheral aspects of his brand in everything he does but you will get to see most  of his core values at display at most times. It is these very values that have made  Branson the star he is right now. He comes across as an unapologetic, unorthodox  yet relatable businessman. I am not sure if there is anyone else like him or ever will  be.   280      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Branson's ability to project his core values lends him an aura of authenticity. While  politicians often work to show their peripheral values as their core ones and vice- versa, Branson believes in being who he is. This saves him time and energy as he  doesn't have to put in any effort in pretending to be someone he is not. You must read  his autobiography just once to understand what has made Branson the Rockstar he  is today. He is among a rare breed of leaders who don't take themselves seriously,  have fun, and encourage others to have a good time as well. These are almost non- existent traits in today's corporate world that thrive on an artificial sense of privilege  and prerogative that must be bequeathed in increasing measure as one grows in  titles and years of experience. You don't have to be a Branson to have a brand worth talking about. The world of  ET is democratic enough to offer a strong and credible platform for you to build a  brand or evolve into one. A conscious effort towards building a brand will yield rich  dividends in the world of ET. Let me elaborate. ET companies thrive on knowledge- driven  innovation  and  there  is  always  a  demand  for  people  who  can  humanize  technology and make it more relatable. In  one  of  my  earlier  roles  for  an  IoT  company,  I  had  to  work  with  a  range  of  stakeholders including media, analysts, partners, telcos, system integrators, and I  often came across situations where I had to simplify things to a basic level. You  cannot simplify something unless you have understood it well. From day one I had  to work to understand things to the level where I could explain it effortlessly. It was  not always a smooth journey, but it was always a learning experience. If you are placed in such a situation, the opportunity is already waiting for you. By  acting as a bridge across a knowledge chasm, you have it made. You have the luxury  of  understanding  two  ends  of  knowledge  including  theory  and  application  and  with a little effort; you can span the chasm and emerge as a thought leader in your  own right. You will have to play your cards well though as you must understand  the baseline knowledge levels, business motivations, and patience levels of these  stakeholders and stitch your narrative accordingly. The best way of expanding your knowledge levels is to constantly be among an  audience that can challenge you and your assumptions. By doing this repeatedly,  you get to replace all your assumptions with facts and thereby stand on a strong  foundation from where it would take a Herculean effort to dislodge you  if anyone  tries that is . I call this rinsing of knowledge. It is the simple practice of getting your  stand validated and to test your knowledge levels at every opportunity so that you  know what gaps exist and how to address them. Another dimension of a personal brand is the extent to which it integrates with who  you are a person. If it blends well, the brand gets strengthened and if it doesn't, then  that's bad news. When celebrities and politicians get caught doing the wrong things  if it was an aberration or was the brand an artificial one? The answer could be both    Building a Personal Brand      281     Energy – How you can brighten the day or workplace or a gathering    Knowledge – Your subject matter expertise    Sincerity – How genuine are you?    Empathy – Your ability to understand and relate to    Communication – Your ability to convey and engage    Sophistication – How you carry and present yourself in public domains    Baseline personality – Who you are when no one is looking  but more importantly, it erodes the credibility of the personal brand of that person.  Which is why it is important to align who you are with your brand. These are the key dimensions of a personal brand:               When you are working towards building a personal brand, you need to be aware  of your strengths and weakness and traits that set you apart. These characteristics  don't just shape your personality but also show up in bits and pieces in everything  you do. 17.7 Getting started Google and Bing your name and see what pops up. If you are lucky enough to have a  unique name, that will make the task much easier. Once you are done, answer these  questions       What do the results indicate? Is that everything that you want to tell the   world?  general?     Are there results that you wouldn't want anyone to see?    Are there pictures and posts that you are proud of?    Do these results hide something that you want people to know?        Now  head  to  your  workplace  or  a  social  place  that  you  frequent  and  ask  these  questions:       What do you feel about my knowledge levels and subject matter expertise in      What are my key personality attributes?    How is it like working with me?    Tell me about your reputation?    Would you recommend me on LinkedIn or to an employer?          Personal branding is mostly about reputation and credibility so if these results are  not showcasing those aspects, you have your work cut out. Always remember that if  you are not in charge of your brand, someone else will be. In the above case, Google    282      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Bing has decided what your personal brand should be. At your workplace, your  colleagues or your manager may decide what your personal brand should look like. That's not a good place to be, is it? Why should someone else be responsible for  something that has such profound implications for your career? Next, conduct a social media audit to see how strong your social outreach is. I have  covered this in one of the earlier chapters focused on social media so won't repeat  most of it again but here are a few elements to focus on:             Compare your answers to a benchmark that you have set for yourself. A sample is  given below:     Your total number of connections    The total reach of your last social media post  engagement metrics     Frequency of posting    Reactions to your posts    How many visits do you get every day?    Audience demographics  Parameter Total connections Total reach of the  last post Frequency of  posting Reactions to posts  Profile visits Audience  demographics  Benchmark  27000 14000  Actual  11000 984  1 per week  1 per month  As you deem  appropriate  290  Representative and  diverse    Up to you   10  Skewed   Difference Percentage   achieved   40.74  7 percent   3-4 posts   Up to you  3.44  Not applicable   Table 17.1: Social media activity effectiveness comparison  I haven't answered the reactions to the post parameter as that is a highly subjective  exercise. You can come up with your parameters to measure your success there. So  now you know that the person in the above example has a long way to go. I have put  this table upfront as I wanted to reiterate the importance of preparing and sharing  good content. I will keep on repeating this with the hope that you will get to work  on this aspect with serious dedication.   Building a Personal Brand      283  17.8 Finding your passion Your brand is incomplete without a strong element of passion. Without passion, you  will not be able to build a brand nor present something authentic to your audience.  To find your passion, you needn't often dig deep. Passion should ideally be visible  and  apparent  but  sometimes  we  bury  it  beneath  layers  of  superfluous  social  or  corporate behaviors. To find your passion, identify the tasks that you enjoy doing or can do effortlessly   tasks like  breathing  don't qualify .  Instead, look at  the  activities that  you enjoy  immensely and make you feel fresh and energetic once you are done with them. You  can also create a negative list which includes activities that you don't enjoy doing  and those that stir up negative emotions. Sometimes passion can stem from negative  emotions. Look for subtle or explicit clues. Once you have found your passion, align that with the brand you are trying to  build. Your brand is fueled by these three P's which you need to employ in copious  amounts:       The right blend of these three leads to your brand establishing a strong foundation  for itself. It will also ensure that your brand remains for the longest period. After  all, what use is a brand that fades away? These three Ps will fuel and sustain your  brand. Any brand that lacks any of these attributes is weak and will suffocate sooner  or later. 17.9 Mapping your key brand attributes To be who you want to be, you need to first understand who you are. For this, you  will have to work out the following assessment:     Passion    Perseverance    Power  Attribute  When people interact with  your personal brand, how do  we want them to feel?  Current  Little or no response  What adjectives could be  used to describe your brand?   Silly, playful  Goal  To feel that I am an SME with  deep expertise. Convey a sense  of pragmatic leadership backed  by humility and empathy.  Energetic, knowledgeable,  adventurous    284      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  What makes your brand  stand out?

Fill up the table  below:  Answer  Feature  Interests  -  things  you  love  to  learn about, such as subjects, or  activities that you enjoy. Think  of  a  project  you  will  always be proud of. Strengths – stuff you are good at.  Those that are easy for you to do. Skills – learned abilities. List out  your skill sets and index them Personal qualities – explain your  best traits. What  are  the  qualities  that  you  admire in other people? What skills do you use often? What are your core values? Those  values cannot be compromised? What  is  your  value  statement?  How  do  you  make  a  difference  in the lives of people you work  or interact with? Work  values  –  those  that  you  value in a work environment.  Talents  –  your  natural  abilities  that you want to share   Building a Personal Brand      285  Hobbies: activities that make you  lose track of time. They also help  you gain energy and perspective  when you use them Value proposition –what you do  in a unique way, how, and why.  It is also called a Unique Selling  Proposition  USP  or sometimes  a mission statement. Who  are  your  supporters  and  why do they support you? Who  are  your  detractors  and  why are they against you?   Table 17.3: Understanding who you are  After completing these two exercises, you will get to understand what your current  brand is all about and what you want your personal brand to be. These exercises  have been designed to make you think. Identifying values and attributes is not an  easy task. You can take help from someone you trust or even a coach or a mentor for  completing this task. 17.10 Creating a unique selling proposition  or USP This is easily the most important part of your brand. It is the essence of what makes  you  a  champ  in  an  area.  It  is  also  the  answer  to  the  question  of  why  someone  should approach you for a task? Before getting into developing your USP, you must  understand why it is important. A USP can help you. Focus is your superpower, and a value statement is the power tool that can help you  achieve it. A value statement targets how you will use your time on what is most  important to you. When you develop a Personal Mission Statement, you gain clarity  on direction and purpose. A value statement will also help you to choose goals that  are aligned with purpose. Your unique selling proposition should ideally stem from these questions:               Who are you?    What do you do love doing?    What are you good at?    Your mission    What can you help with?   286      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  You needn't restrict yourself to these questions. Instead, dig deeper and see what  is it that makes you stand out in the job market or any other place where you are  competing with someone? USP is a strong pillar of your personal brand. Without  it, your brand is just another colorless sachet of shampoo sitting on a store shelf  without standing out in any manner. Remember the elevator pitch that we were talking about earlier? USP is almost 90  percent of your elevator pitch. If your elevator pitches don't include your USP, it is  as good as a wasted pitch. 17.11 Managing perceptions So, the next question on your mind would be can I change an established perception?  The answer is yes but it will take some hard work on your part. A few years back,  when a colleague of mine was working for a Fintech company. He had this issue with  superiors where he used to get into minor tiffs because he was a no-compromise  guy. Which meant that he used to do his bit and expect everyone to do that as well. He used to expect people to be ethical in their behavior and approach towards the  project deliverables. He could tolerate these behaviors:       Documenting  every  single  conversation  especially  bits  that  were  not   important from a project deliverable or time.          Pushing people to work over weekends to meet unreasonable deadlines.    Being pushed by the executive assistant to a senior management guy to do   things within unreasonable timelines.     People targeting his team members for flimsy reasons.    He was quite vocal about my opposition to the practices listed above and the result  was that he was branded as a rebel. He was at times quite difficult to work with  and sometimes unable to see the other side of things and it did land his manager  in a tricky situation a few times. There was one instance where he wrote back to a  powerful C level lady saying he couldn't do what she wanted me to as I was not  receiving enough support from her team. Now, this was a genuine grievance, but the  lady concerned was not someone who heard the word no many times. Hell, broke  loose. This did affect his branding at the workplace. Besides, he didn't have a big circle  of  acquaintances  to  defend  him  and  the  word  did  travel  fast  as  it  was  a  small  organization. One fine day he decided to change things and go mellow and see if  things improve for him. He then spent the next two years fixing up his image and  doing things he wouldn't have otherwise readily agreed to do. He had decided that  he was going to quit in the next 24 months and so he stopped looking at everything  from a high level and instead took everything at a tactical level. He felt at peace  and could focus more and avoided getting into tricky situations. His friends circle    Building a Personal Brand      287              expanded, and he was able to do get a few good things done before he left. His  notice period was a blissful one. He is doing well in his career now. To this day when we discuss those days, he does  feel that things could have been a lot more different if he had a manager with some  spine. Though things didn't go his way initially, he was able to learn a lot from that  episode and move on faster. If those incidents hadn't happened, he would still have  been working in the same organization and would have grown roots and become  part of the toxic cultural fabric of that company. Here is how he fixed his personal brand:       Expanded his circle of acquaintances at the workplace and started interacting   with more people.     Always influenced his way into having a few champions for who stood for   him and his work and were holding senior positions in the company.     He started accepting work without any conditions; spent a few weekends  and took on additional work as well [this is not required. If you are smart,  you will know how to avoid this one].     He  started  interacting  more  with  all  EAs.  Especially  those  who  were  his   detractors.     He started getting involved in all internal activities including joining the   cafeteria committee  never underestimate the power of this one .  He had to do all this to fix his brand. Also, he took some voluntary activity for the  company including fixing the brand identity of the CEO and others. Within a few months, of this rebranding exercise, he got an offer letter from a new  employer and was able to move ahead without leaving any bad blood behind. You  don't have to be close to everyone. You don't need to have endless support from  everyone. You just need the right people to back you at the right time. My approach was simple. I just imagined the ideal personal brand I wanted to portray and  worked backward from there. I was authentic to my inner self and never did anything to  step on someone's interests or goals. Instead, I helped everyone without even thinking twice  including doing things outside my work hours. I didn't stop when I felt that my brand had  improved. I went on and took that effort to the level of a habit so that it became part of who I  was, this is what he told me:   288      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  Areas  What are the  things you are   great at?

Break it down into a few attributes.     Identify  areas  for  development  from  soft  skills  and  personality  attribute  perspective. Identify timelines for your goals.    Identify people who can help you and keep you motivated.       Identify the tasks that can help you and help you learn as well.    Work towards developing each attribute in parallel or isolation.    Track your progress.    Get feedback from your peers, often directly or indirectly.                Building a Personal Brand      289  Never do anything for the sake of doing it or to project a perception alone. That  would mean faking it. In the above example, he never did that just so that he would  be in people's good books. That was one of his goals, but the bigger motivation was  to make sure that he was at peace and could move towards becoming a more likable  brand within the company. Since I felt that that that was exactly who I was deep within,  I didn't have to do much to bring it out. At no point did I do something just for the heck of  doing it or to earn some brownie points. This was about salvaging my reputation and making  a clean and grudge-free exit, he said. 17.12 Laws of personal branding As with every other activity, there are certain laws associated with branding that will  help us understand the concept and the forces at play better. Here are a few of them:    The law of leadership: All groups and teams or other aggregations need    leaders  who  can  give  clarity  in  vision  and  action  especially  in  times  of  adversity.                          The  law  of  personality:  A  great  personal  brand  should  be  based  on  the   personality that is authentic and is presented with all its imperfections.     The law of distinctiveness: Effective personal brands are those that need to  be presented with a clear and differentiated value proposition. Differentiation  makes the person and their attributes standout. Differentiated values also  ensure that you are not placed in pre-existing buckets or categories that may  reduce the value of your brand.     The law of visibility: Personal brand should always be visible before and   after a person turns into a brand     The law of unity: A person's personal life that lies behind the personal brand  should be aligned to the moral and ethical values and the overall attitude  of the brand. Personal life should ideally reflect an image that you want to  instill in a personal brand.     The law of persistence: A personal brand needs time to evolve and grow,  and when the process is running, it is essential to pay attention to each step  trends.     The law of goodwill: Personal brands will be in a better position to deliver  lasting  results  if  the  person  behind  it  is  perceived  positively.  The  person  behind must convey positive values. This leads to the establishment of a  strong brand that lasts.     The  law  of  specialization:  A  distinguishing  feature  of  a  strong  personal  brand has to with accuracy of a specialization that is concentrated solely on  a certain strength, attribute, skill, or achievement.   290      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code 17.13 The 8'Cs of personal branding  Figure 17.1: The 8 ‘Cs of communication  These eight C's lie at the heart of your branding effort.

To do  o  This is where your brand will be showcased. It could be your workplace,  your college, your social media presence, or any situation or medium  you use to convey your brand.  o  Tailor your communication according to the medium.  For instance,  you can turn into a storyteller on your blog while you cannot afford  to be one when you are on Twitter where you will have to give more  precise information. Beyond that, make sure you hold on to your values  while you innovate and improve the alignment of your messages to the  medium.     Why is it important?  Clarity         To do  o  Clarity makes your brand more engaging and easier to associate with.  Lack of clarity may turn off your audience or make them assume things  about you.  o  Be clear in your branding mission and value statement, to begin with.  From there on adhering to basic rules every time you engage people  which avoids burdening their attention unnecessarily. Think, speak,  and communicate with clarity.  Content   o        Why is it important?   Imagine two ends of a river separated by a huge gap filled with river  water flowing at great speeds. Imagine someone seeking to cross the  river to reach the other side. Now in this situation, the person is the  message, the boat or the bridge is the content and someone on the  other side of the river represents your audience. Content is the vehicle  for  carrying  your  thoughts  and  ideas  to  the  audience  and  unless  your content strategy is aligned to this need; you will not be able to  communicate well.   292      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code     To do  o  Write and speak often. Use each opportunity to convey value to your  audience. Always remember, there are no perfect writers. Each time you  write, you head in the direction of becoming a good writer. If someone  claims to be a perfect writer, they are either aliens from another planet  or they are lying. I suspect the latter to be the case.  Consistency         Why is it important?     To do  o  Consistency indicates authenticity and attention to detail. Lack of it  will  hamper  the  growth  of  your  brand.  Being  consistent  with  your  messaging, values, narrative, work, and everything that defines you  will decide how far your brand will travel.  o  Write down your mission statement and the values you hold to your  heart. For a few days or months, see if everything you are doing or  saying is aligned to these values. Also, see the frequency of such work  and see if there is a consistency to that. Like good sportspersons, you  need to be consistent to succeed.  Consideration         Why is it important?  o  You need to pay attention to the people around you. Be considerate and  empathic in your approach. Never take people for granted or misuse  their good offices. Treat  and communicate with  people the way you  want to be treated.  o  Develop empathy and learn to understand people more.     Why is it important?  o  Your network is your primary set of champions who can do a lot for  you and for whom you can do a lot. They are the ones who will help  take your brand places. Expand your network but make sure you stay  in touch with them.  o  Build your network, reach out to them, and help them whenever you   can. Networking is all about giving.     To do      Contacts         To do                  Building a Personal Brand      293  Tangible benefits    from a strong personal brand  17.14 Building your brand So  now  let's  look  at  an  actionable  strategy  to  build  your  brand.  These  are  just  broad  guidelines  from  my  personal  experience  backed  by  everything  I  have  read.  Please  feel  to  use  your  discretion  to  add  points  or  eliminate  them  based  on  your  priorities.  Some  of  the  points  may  seem repetitive:    Apart  from  making  you  stand  out  as  a  professional  and  affording  you  fame,  opportunities  and  recognition,  what  else  can  a  strong  personal  brand  give  you?  Well, to begin with, subject matter experts  who  are  more  visible  across  forums,  end  up making a lot more money. But let that  not  be  your  only  motivation,  though.   According to studies, individuals who are  strong  brands  can  charge  up  to  a  1000  USD for more the same work. Think about  that for a minute. So, if you are nor building a brand, you are  essentially underselling yourself.     Understand the main motive  behind  building  a  personal  brand:  It  could  be  anything  from  being  able  to  improve  your ability to help others, to  learn  more  by  getting  more  exposure to the industry and  its problems or it could simply  be to use your knowledge and  expertise to solve pressing challenges at a regional or national or global level.   List down the attributes your brand stands for: I have already covered this.    Brand outline: Figure out some of your characteristics and key traits that  you would want to weave into your brand. Do you want your brand to be  perceived  as  very  suave,  polished,  and  professionally  mature,  or  do  you  want it to be more humorous, approachable, and informal?                          Shortlist your passions and stuff that makes you tick.    Find out and reach out to people who can help you on this journey.       What  additional  skills  do  you  need?  What  kind  of  training,  credentials,   Identify the avenues available for you to express your brand.  certifications, or awards would you need to build credibility?     Who is your target audience? A big mistake that many make in this area is to  try and appeal to the widest segment possible. This doesn't work. The more  information you have on your target audience, the better it will be for you to  understand their unique needs and figure out ways to help or engage them.    What kind of value will you add to the lives of your target audience? Will  you solve a certain problem for instance? You should be as specific as possible  here.   294      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                See what kind of brand results from a blend of the above. This will help you   package yourself.    List  out  a  set  of  milestones  for  your  journey:  This  should  include  endorsements, increase in social media following, papers published, media  coverage, IPs obtained, and association with agencies like industry bodies.    Create and share the content of value: this is another essential part of your   branding exercise.             Evolve a visibility strategy: sharing content is a good way to stay visible.  Another  way  is  to  use  the  audience  belonging  to  others  such  as  media,  podcasts, etc. Identify KPIs to measure your success.        Going deeper: let us explore some parts  only the key ones  of the above list   in more detail now. Target audience My experience informs me that not everyone will always agree with you or your  stand. But you need to know your audience in-depth and there are no two ways  about it. Here are a few ways to get to know your audience better:         Who are they? What generation do they belong to? Where do they work?    What kind of problems are they facing? What is the main challenge they face   in their professional or personal lives?          What ways of communication and engagement do they prefer?    What constitutes their dreams, goals, inspirations, and aspirations? What   will they be interested in?     Why should they engage with me or my brand?    What challenges will I face in engaging them?    Will my interaction with them be seasonal?        Content What kind of content will my audience be interested in? That is an important question.  Again, there is no one size fits all messages that can go out there. Instead, if your  audience is diverse you want to use digital help to customize your key messages  for different segments of your audience. Use infographics, tweets, short posts, polls,  articles, and podcasts to convey key messages to your audience. Creating, curating, and sharing content builds and sustains your brand. It is the  best way of building trust and credibility and to showcase your ability to solve  problems and add value. It also positions you as an expert and a thought leader that    Building a Personal Brand      295  opens more avenues for you. Medium, LinkedIn, Redditt, and Twitter are the main  channels that you can use. YouTube is also a great way to keep it more personal and  even earn some money to invest in advertising or audience building. Strong brands engage their audiences regularly. You should too. Start with a content  plan and then get into the execution bit.  In case you are unable to create your content,  you can also comment on posts by others that can also help you grow your network. Visibility strategy: this will have to include the media in addition to social media. If  you are ever asked to participate in an interview, webinar, or podcast say yes – no  matter how tough it looks. Don't be afraid to engage audiences on platforms that are  new or scare you. The more comfortable you become with public appearances, the  more natural your engagements would turn out to be. Reach out to and engage people in the media either through your marketing team  or directly if your company policy allows it. Media is always looking out for topical  experts to share their knowledge on issues that are current and relevant for them.  You can even pitch story ideas to them and participate in that story. Nothing however beats media interactions and authored articles. So keep an eye  out for them and make sure you have enough friends in the media to ensure these  opportunities reach you at the right time. You can also sign up to be a guest blogger on sites like TechCrunch and others and  write articles for blogs run by experts and for your company blog as well.  Figure 17.2: The personal credibility quadrant   296      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code 17.15 Breaking free of quadrants If you study the above quadrant, it becomes apparent that there are blocks where  you could get stuck at various times in your career. These are the 4 parts of this  quadrant:       Lower left part: Usually, people who are starting their careers in ET fall in  this portion. Sometimes, however, people may get stuck here as they never  paid attention to building their brand and becoming an effective employee.    Lower right part: Most people in the ET world fall in this category. They  are subject matter experts and can be a strong influencer but, their influence  remains  low  as  they  have  not  invested  enough  in  becoming  a  strong  personal brand. People stuck in this area are usually well known within their  companies or in their immediate circle but are not well known beyond those  confines.        Upper  left  part:  This  is  a  part  belonging  to  people  who  carry  plenty  of  influence but as not very credible for various reasons. Corporate leaders and  those who endorse products that carry risks or have been associated with a  scam or some episode of breach of integrity in the past and therefore cannot  be trusted fall in this part of the quadrant. These people are still influential in  their circles but carry little or no credibility.     Upper right part: This is where you should try and belong to. This includes  people who have turned their subject matter expertise and credibility levels  to turn into strong personal brands. People here have a tale to tell in terms of  how they build their brand and it is important to listen to them to see what  they did well and how.         Figure 17.3: The 4B Personal Brand Mapping Framework  Source, Deepthi Rajan    Building a Personal Brand      297  17.16 My biggest mistake Frankly, I started paying attention to my brand much later in my career. I was always  under the impression that my work will speak for itself and evolve into a brand  someday. I couldn't have been more mistaken. Today, when I look back, I wish I  could have figured this bit out early in my career. Building a personal brand is a bit like investing. If you start investing in your 20s,  you have the luxury of retiring early or tuning into a venture capitalist or even  starting a start-up  provided you maintain consistency and investing discipline .  The earlier you start the more chances you have of building a strong brand. You can  also get away with more mistakes early on and learn from them. Once I understood the true value of personal branding, I had to cover plenty of  ground in a short period. Also, the number of choices I had reduced significantly as  I started late. Conclusion Don't  wait  for  things  to  happen  to  you.  Instead,  go  out  there  and  make  things  happen. Any investment you will make in building your brand will help you reap  rich dividends and take your career along a trajectory that you could have never  imagined. It will also bring into your life people, places, and opportunities that will  lead to a more satisfying and fruitful career. Build a brand that is based on helping  others improve their lives and you will for sure leave an inspiring legacy behind. The world needs skillful and empathetic leaders and concepts such as branding help  carry your story across digital frontiers. Your time is now, and the clock is ticking so  go out there and do your magic. May the force be with you. Question and answers   1.  Can you tell me the top 5 things to do to build my brand?         Write, speak, and appear often in public forums.    Be  clear  about  your  strengths  and  always  be  at  work  to  fix  your   weaknesses.     Always help others.    Never let go of any opportunity to learn unlearn.    Seek professional help in case you find the task daunting.  2.  How do I understand or outline my weaknesses?   Ans. Try to answer these questions and you will get clues:               298      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                        What could I improve on? What do I think I should be better at?    Are  my  weaknesses  preventing  me  from  doing  my  job  correctly  or   from excelling on the job?     Keep listening to people around you and you will get enough inputs      Has  my  manager  or  someone  else  given  me  feedback  about  my   on areas to work on  weaknesses?     Which weaknesses do I need to focus on to improve at work?  3.  What are my assets and liabilities as a personal brand?   Ans. These are your assets: skills, experience, interests, passion, core values,  and beliefs. Your liabilities are lack of confidence, lack of understanding of  your  strengths,  and  inability  to  comprehend  the  importance  of  personal  branding.   Post-script      299  Chapter 18 Post-script  The quest to turn into a better version of ourselves is a continuous one and there are   no pitstops on the way. All you have for companionship are your confidence and  the skills you pick up along the way. This is indeed a journey of discovery for those  who care. We have to understand that this is not just about becoming somebody but  also about introducing a transformation from within. In the last few months, we have seen people and governments being pulled into  battles on multiple fronts. This is the first year in my memory which has seen a major  pandemic, natural disasters, lawlessness, job loss at a massive scale, recession, and  governments are running out of money. Generations that are currently part of the  workforce and those that will join in the next decade will have to deal with the fall  out of these forces that are gathering strength as we speak. Frankly, it is too early to see how things will be a few weeks down the line, let  alone 2021. But having said that, we are now in a position to come to the following  conclusions with a certain degree of confidence:       2020 is the year of change. By the end of this year, the landscape surrounding  governance, education, technology, research, healthcare, defense, and even  multi-lateral relationships will look completely different from what it was at  the beginning of this year.     Things will take a while to settle down so don't expect anything to make      sense for at least the next 18 months.   300      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code                       As a job seeker or someone who is just entering the job market or someone   who is already a part of the job market, you need to tread carefully now.     Government  spending  is  going  to  go  down  further  and  this  will  have  a   cascading effect on various segments around the world.     This is the time to dig in while taking one step at a time. Time to reorient,   refocus and in the long run, reinvent yourself.     There is a possibility that certain destabilizing forces may be unleashed in  the near future. There could be more terror attacks, wars, or financial fraud.  Cyberattacks have already gone up. All I am saying is we need to stay diligent  and prepared. There could be nations and groups who could be seeing this  as an opportunity to unleash more mayhem.  Impact on the job economy and beyond We now have access to some numbers that will help us understand how the pandemic  has impacted the job market:       The  most  recent  figures  show  that  young  people  are  disproportionately  affected by the COVID 19 crisis, with multiple shocks including disruption  to  education  and  training,  employment  and  income  losses,  and  greater  difficulties in finding a job.     A total of 178 million young workers around the world, more than four in ten  young people employed globally, were working in hard-hit sectors when the  crisis began. Almost 77 percent  or 328 million  of the world's young workers  were in informal jobs, compared with around 60 percent of adult workers   aged 25 and above . The youth informality rate ranges from 32.9 percent  in Europe and Central Asia to 93.4 percent in Africa. Even before the crisis,  more than 267 million young people were not in employment, education, or  training  NEET , including almost 68 million unemployed young people.     On  top  of  the  longer-term  challenges,  the  COVID  19  crisis  is  affecting  young people around the world in three ways:  1  disruption to education  and training, which could reduce potential employment opportunities and  earnings in the future;  2  the current wave of job losses and the collapse  of  businesses  and  start-ups  are  reducing  earnings  and  employment   and  threatening rights at work ; and  3  the emergence of greater obstacles to  finding work,  re- entering the labor market and trying to transition to better  jobs.  The above data has been obtained from a report released by the International Labor  Organization called ILO Monitor: COVID-19 and the world of work. Fourth edition.  You can use Google to locate this report or do a search on the ILO website ilo.org.   Post-script      301  These are mere indicators and while the data may vary according to regions, one  thing  is  clear.  There  is  a  tough  time  for  everyone  in  the  job  market.  People  are  talking about the emergence of a lockdown generation that includes young victims of  the pandemic who will be deprived of a chance to express themselves to their full  potential. All is however not lost and for those who refuse to give up, this marks the  beginning of a new battle altogether. To cope with changes that are occurring at an  unprecedented scale, we will have to resort to some new and innovative measures.  This is the time for reform and transformation; a time to introspect and chart a new  course. It's about the resistance Many movements are going on around the world. Many of these are about social  justice,  sustainable  development,  and  equitable  treatment  of  various  races. Your  fight to stay relevant in the job market should be equally inspired and inspirational.  Imagine being deprived of a chance to live up to your full potential just because you  were afraid to explore and discover? Just because you were willing to go with the  flow or surrender to circumstances? Though life is short enough to live fully it is  certainly long enough for regrets to hurt. Don't let this happen to you. Just like life, the job market will also test you periodically and you should always be  ready to accept the challenge. Don't give in to fear or anxiety. Instead, channel that  anxiety into a force for good. Everyone goes through these cycles of good times and  bad ones. But the ones who can keep their head high, think on their feet, and keep  making efforts to achieve their goals will go on to win eventually. When things are not working out, life is telling you something. If you are willing to  listen and use such times to reinvent yourself, you will go a long way in your career  and even turn into someone that others can look up to when they are facing a storm  or a depression. So how do you resist? Learn, upskill, network, unlearn, explore, persist, lookout for  new opportunities, widen your horizon, do voluntary work, help someone in need,  and be inspired to do something that no one else can even think of. In the early  days of my career, I used to use Google extensively, patiently searching for jobs that  are hidden behind pages and pages of irrelevant matter. Because of those days, the  chances of a recruiter reaching out to you were very rare. I used to update my CV  every few hours just to ensure that it turns up on the first page across job sites when  someone is searching for a candidate. This is more than a decade and a half ago.  Since I have had many more things to stay relevant and gain access to interesting  roles. Today, a patient job search on Google or job sites doesn't help much and that's how  things have changed. Instead, now you have to be present on multitudinous sites  with relevant content and matter to present. Things will keep on changing and it    302      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  is always up to you to stay ahead of the curve and stand out. Even now there are  plenty of niches to fill in the ET world. Such niches are created every few months. I hope this book has given enough knowhow in terms of tactics, strategies, and  thought points to initiate a transformation from within. The next few years will  decide if your career reaches a cruising altitude or it will be an aborted takeoff. No  matter what, keep the engines in full throttle. Recession is always transitionary but  your appetite for success should outlast every downturn. Let your appetite inspire  you to succeed. Always remember that it is your journey and your story. Make sure you are the  one who gets to write it. When you surrender control of your narrative, someone  else may do the writing for you and it might not turn out the way you wanted it to.  Don't let your career be adrift in an ocean of mediocrity left to sail at the mercy of  winds of compulsion. Instead, become an island of excellence that inspires, sets new  benchmarks for others, and provides stability to not just your team or your company  but also your industry. More importantly, is the force that propels the ideals you  stand for. Let your goals guide you and let your journey inspire you. Be a force for  good. So, never give up, never surrender. Keep going and become your best. I wish you  success, happiness, relevance, and glory in everything you do. Numquam Concedere.   Post-script      303  Addendum: while we await the vaccine  According to a report from the jobs portal Indeed, tech job postings were down 36  percent as of late July 2020 as compared to the same period last year. In the initial  phases of the Covid-19 induced recession, many companies honored their hiring  commitments but with segments such as oil and gas and banking reducing their  tech budgets, it was only a matter of time before the job market showed some form  of correction and it did. While hiring is down, it has not stopped completely. In fact  in the US, according to a U.S. Department of Labor's August jobs report over 13,000  jobs were added in the Computer Systems Design and Related Areas sector.  So what has changed in the last few months in terms of the skills? To understand that,  we need to understand how Covid-19 has impacted the business and technology  priorities  of  various  sectors  and  businesses.    A  survey  conducted  by  MIT  Tech  Review  Insights  in August  2020  covering  372  business  leaders  from  around  the  world, reveals these data points:       Nearly two-thirds of survey respondents expect Covid-19 to disrupt the way   their companies innovate.                    Businesses  are  building  new  capabilities  and  ecosystem  partners  and   automating as much as possible.     As business leaders redraw their technology roadmaps, they’re investing  more in product and service digitalization—that is, using digital technologies  to produce new value  81% , data analytics  63% , supply chain digitalization   63% , and cloud migration  61% .     The study notes a significant rise in AI investments  say 53% of respondents    and the internet of things  46% .     Technology  priorities  vary  depending  on  how  well  organizations  have  weathered  the  coronavirus  storm.  For  instance,  85%  of  companies  that  took the biggest financial battering expect to invest in product and service  digitalization,  compared  with  70%  of  the  organizations  whose  income  increased during the pandemic.     Most job descriptions now talk about the ability to work and collaborate   remotely   The  most  important  takeaway  from  the  study  is  this  “organizations  are  leaning  heavily  on  technology  to  adapt  to  the  economic  environment  the  coronavirus  pandemic  created.  Nine  out  of  10  business  executives  say  technology  adoption    304      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code  will increase”. This means that tech uptake will increase in the coming months and  years provided business picks up and provides a monetary cushion so to speak for  investments in areas linked to automation and tech induced transformation.  Another  important  development  that  has  emerged  from  the  pandemic  is  the  increasing adoption of work from home by businesses. It is difficult to say if this  trend will sustain in the long term, but it is definitely going to be around for a  while. Such a shift has out the spotlight on cloud solutions, cybersecurity, remote  management of infrastructure, and allied services. In terms of jobs, this means that  skill sets related to on-demand software, remote collaboration, and AI will overtake  the demand for hardware and network engineers, for instance.   In  the  months  to  come,  skills  related  to  cloud  management,  machine  learning,  development  of  AI-based  tools  and  point  applications,  cloud  engineering  and  development,  integration  and  management  of  various  cloud  derivatives  and  development of algorithmic libraries, customer experience, and interface models,  and other learning models will be in demand. Such a significant shift will also have  implications for the security of assets, data, and infrastructure and therefore threat  researchers and analysts, security operations center managers, risk management,  and cyber resilience experts will also see a rise in calls from hiring teams.    Digital skills such as remote collaboration, virtual project management, and digital  leadership will pave way for the emergence of a new workforce. Yes, we are indeed  in the middle of a once in a generation tectonic shift. While the onset of this century  saw  us  move  away  from  bulky  technology  to  those  that  fit  into  our  palms,  the  coming months will see a clear migration towards technologies that will be based  on the remote engagement of intellect. This is not going to be easy and while many  keep talking about ‘digital transform’ being a panacea for all kinds of problems, at a  realistic level, there will be some degree of pain involved in this transition.  In the past, some areas such as customer experience did see some level of digital  transformation  DT , the larger tech universe was not impacted to a very significant  extent by it as it was always a good concept to market and talk about in public  forums but when it came to implementing such a transformation in letter and spirit,  many businesses and seasoned tech veterans have burnt their fingers more often  than we know. It is fair to assume that over 2 percent of all presentations ever created  must have spoken about DT in some form or manner.   AI is the clear winner When this year started, the debate on ethical AI was still raging. But that didn’t  stop start-ups and businesses from deploying AI across pain areas to fix problems  emerging from or connected to Covid-19. Though apprehension about AI remains,  the adoption of AI is growing. How do I say that you ask? With a huge chunk of the  workforce working remotely, digital collaboration is growing, and this means that    Post-script      305  we are generating, storing, and accessing more data than ever before. This means we  are hoarding data and learnings.  Such data can yield significant patterns and other information that can be analyzed  to analyze and derive workflows and responses. So, the adoption of AI will gain  momentum in the days to come although the number of projects that fail in scope and  deployment will also increase. Repeated surveys have shown that AI and machine  learning are going to be priorities for businesses and decision-makers.   In addition to AI, IoT and cybersecurity are hot right now.   The game plan 2022 and beyond  While we await the emergence of vaccine and for the dust to settle down, here are a  few things you should do to stay relevant in the ET job market:    It’s evolution at work: the skilled and well-adapted will survive and emerge  from  this  phase.  You  need  to  have  patience  and  work  your  moves  with  diligence. Mass mailing resumes blindly to everyone will not help. Neither  will applying to every LinkedIn job out there. Use the tips giving in this book  to finetune your strategy and tactics at every stage                      For  those  who  are  planning  to  transition  to  ET,  focus  on  ensuring  that  you continue to deliver in your current role. You cannot become a winner  overnight. There will be many transitional skills that you can carry along  with you to your new ET role. Focus on honing these skills while you are  waiting on the tarmac. The transition could be a short one so be prepared to  take off on a short runway      Keep identifying new niches that you can slip into: transitionary phases  often open up new roles in ET that you could transition to faster. Keep an eye  out for them.      For those in roles such as sales and marketing, this is the time to shine. Focus  on activating new revenue streams and seeing money where no one has to  entrench yourself in ET. This is the time to try our new methods and tactics  to improve margins and revenue for your organization      Trends don’t matter at a micro-level: the newspapers and analysts would  have you believe that it is all gloom and doom in the post-pandemic economic  environment. But things could be different at a micro-economic level. Hiring  is still going on and new jobs are being added every month. It is just a matter  of connecting with the right role and proving your credentials and you will  soon get a new role and beat the recessionary economy. I have seen many  people do that you shouldn’t be any different. It is just a matter of focus and  action    306      Cracking the Emerging Tech Code      Invest in yourself: read more, listen more, gather, and analyze information.
