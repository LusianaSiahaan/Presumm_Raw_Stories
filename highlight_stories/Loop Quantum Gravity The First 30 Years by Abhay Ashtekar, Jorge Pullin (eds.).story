Perhaps the deepest feature of this theory is the encoding of the gravitational inter- action in the very geometry of spacetime. Thus, general relativity required that we describe the physical universe using a new syntax — that of the pseudo-Riemannian geometry. As we venture beyond Einstein to unify general relativity with quantum physics, then, we are led to seek a fresh syntax to compose the new conceptual paradigm. Loop quantum gravity  LQG  takes the central lesson of general rela- tivity seriously, adopting the view that the natural home of Planck scale physics would be in quantum Riemannian geometry.  Creation of this syntax is challenging because all of twentieth century physics presupposes a classical spacetime, with its rigid metric, sharp light cones, and en- suing micro-causality. It is quite unsettling to lift the anchor that tied us to these safe havens and learn to sail the open seas, foregoing the comfort of an underly- ing spacetime continuum. Yet, hundreds of researchers in LQG chose to abandon this comfort zone, venture forth, and toil together to make this courageous leap. Given that it took astronomers and physicists many decades to come to grips with the dynamical nature of spacetime enshrined in general relativity, it is not surpris- ing that it has taken a while to unfold the new syntax and use it to address the age-old, central problems of quantum gravity. In the 1990s, they laid down the foundations of quantum geometry. The central idea was to use a reformulation of general relativity in the language of gauge theories without, however, any ref- erence to a background spacetime geometry. The ensuing framework turned out not only to be natural in intuitive, geometric terms, but it is also supported by precise uniqueness theorems that reveal the astonishing power of background in- dependence. This kinematic framework provides the foundation for the current eﬀorts to describe non-perturbative, background independent quantum dynamics. Over the last ﬁfteen years, these eﬀorts have provided a rich set of concrete results, creating new paradigms to describe the very early universe and quantum properties of black holes. In particular, the quantum nature of spacetime geometry has been shown to be directly responsible for resolution of the most important singularities that plague general relativity, for an unforeseen interplay between the ultraviolet and the infrared in the very early universe, and for creating avenues to recover the  v   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page vi  vi  Preface  information that is apparently lost behind black hole horizons. The maturity of the ﬁeld is reﬂected in the fact that now there are several research programs aimed at bridging observations and the Planck scale physics emerging from quantum geom- etry, especially in the context of the early universe.  The eight Chapters of this volume, authored by leading younger experts in various areas, provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the ﬁeld. Thus, the volume complements the existing excellent texts on LQG, in that it is up to date and covers all the main areas, rather than focusing on a few. We envisage the volume to serve three purposes. First, it provides a detailed but concise introduction to the ﬁeld for beginning researchers. Part 2 introduces the conceptual, mathematical and physical foundations, while Part 3 summarizes the applications to black holes and the early universe, bringing out a detailed interplay between the theory and observations. The material contained in these Chapters is suﬃciently detailed to provide a thorough understanding of the basic structure that is needed to pursue research projects specialized in one area or another. Second, the volume should also be helpful to researchers who are already working in LQG. The subject has grown immensely, with tens of thousands of journal articles. Therefore, it has become increasingly diﬃcult to follow, even in the International LQG seminars, the current lines of research in areas of LQG that one is not actively working on. Parts 2 and 3 provide the material that is necessary ﬁrst to understand the current research, and then to contribute to these other areas. Part 1 should help in understanding the interrelations between diverse ideas, distinguishing what is well-established from what remains open, and grasping the healthy tensions that are fertile grounds for further research. Third, the monograph should also be useful to physicists, mathematicians and cosmologists outside LQG, who are interested in issues at the interface of general relativity and quantum physics. They will see the opportunities and challenges that accompany the notion of ‘background independence’, the deep interplay between geometry and physics, and fertile areas where Planck scale physics can have observational implications in the foreseeable future. Finally, senior experts can also use this monograph as a text for an advanced course.  Since the volume is part of the ‘100 Years of General Relativity’ series of mono- graphs, we will conclude by comparing and contrasting LQG with other approaches to physics beyond Einstein. A key feature of LQG is that it is rooted in well- established physics: principles of general relativity and quantum mechanics. The underlying viewpoint is that ideas that have no observational support should not constitute an integral part of the foundation of quantum gravity, even when they can lead to rich mathematical structures. In particular, a negative cosmological constant, extended objects, supersymmetry and speciﬁc matter content involving towers of ﬁelds and particles do not feature in the fundamentals of LQG. The start- ing point is general relativity coupled with matter — just as the starting point in QED is the classical Maxwell theory with charged sources. However, LQG is   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page vii  Preface  vii  also radical in important ways. The fundamental quanta of geometry are one di- mensional, polymer-like excitations over nothing, rather than gravitons, the wavy undulations over a continuum background. In particular, classical general relativity is recovered only in an appropriate coarse-grained limit. This balance between well- established principles and radical ideas is a hallmark of LQG. Another key feature is the prominent role of the quantum nature of spacetime geometry. In particular, in LQG the area operator has a lowest non-zero eigenvalue, called the area gap. It is a basic microscopic parameter of the theory that dictates the macroscopic pa- rameters, such as the maximum value that matter density and curvature can attain in the very early universe. Thus, quantum geometry provides a natural, built-in ul- traviolet cutoﬀ. In this respect it diﬀers from other approaches such as Asymptotic Safety or Dynamical Triangulations that are more closely aligned with standard quantum ﬁeld theories. Because of its emphasis on quantum geometry and non- perturbative techniques, LQG is well placed to address the long standing problems of quantum gravity, such as the resolution of physically important singularities, the so-called ‘trans-Planckian issues’, the ‘problem of time’ and diﬀeomorphism covari- ance. Indeed, over the past decade and a half, these issues have been at the center of investigations in LQG. On the other hand, the very emphasis on quantum geometry and physics at the Planck scale has made it diﬃcult for LQG to make rapid progress on establishing a detailed contact with low energy eﬀective theories, and on ﬁnding implications of quantum gravity on matter couplings. By contrast, the Asymptotic Safety program, for example, has made signiﬁcant progress in both directions. In String Theory, advances have occurred in yet other directions. Since the advent of AdS CFT some two decades ago, focus of research has slowly moved away from quintessentially quantum gravity issues to applications of techniques from general relativity and supergravity to problems in an array of non-gravitational areas of physics. Thus, because leading approaches use diverse points of departure, reﬂect- ing the striking diﬀerences on what should be regarded as fundamental, they have led to new insights in diﬀerent directions, reﬂecting their complementary strengths. Given the diﬃculty of the task, this diversity is both healthy and essential.

One leaves behind the terra ﬁrma of a rigid spacetime continuum in the hope of ﬁnding a more supple and richer habitat for physics beyond Einstein. In Columbus’ case, while the vision and hope that led to the expedition were indeed almost ‘insane’, he was well aware of the risks. Therefore he embarked on the voyage well prepared, equipped with the most reliable navigational charts and tools then available. Similarly, in LQG one starts with principles of general relativity and quantum mechanics that are ﬁrmly rooted in observations, knowing fully well that one will encounter surprises along the way and habitats at the destination will not look anything like those on these charts. Yet the known charts are essential at the point of departure to ensure that the sails are properly aligned and one does not drift into a fantasy landscape with little relation to the physical world we inhabit. The ﬁve chapters in Part 2 of this volume describe current status of this voy- age and the new habitats it has already led to. One starts with well established general relativity coupled to matter and uses proven tools from quantum mechanics insisting, however, that there be no ﬁelds in the background, not even a space- time metric. This insistence leads one to a rigorous mathematical framework whose conceptual implications are deep [1–3]. Quantum spacetime does not look like a 4-dimensional continuum at all; fundamental excitations of geometry — and hence of gravity — are polymer like; geometric observables have purely discrete eigenval- ues; local curvature in the classical theory is replaced by non-local holonomies of a spin connection; and, quantum dynamics inherits a natural, built-in ultraviolet cut- oﬀ. There is no ‘objective time’ to describe quantum dynamics; there are no rigid light cones to formulate causality. Nonetheless, time evolution can be described in detail through relational dynamics in the cosmological setting, where familiar causality emerges through qualitatively new eﬀective descriptions that are valid all  5   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 6  6  A. Ashtekar & J. Pullin  the way to the full Planck regime. Thus, the ﬁnal landscape is very diﬀerent from that of general relativity and quantum mechanics, although both provided guiding principles at the point of departure.  The three Chapters of Part 3 illustrate the Planck scale ‘ﬂora and fauna’ that inhabits this new landscape. The ultraviolet properties of geometry naturally tames the most important singularities of general relativity — in particular, the big bang is replaced by a quantum bounce. In the very early universe, cosmological perturba- tions propagate on these regular, bouncing quantum geometries, giving rise to eﬀects that are within observational reach. Quantum geometry has also opened a new win- dow on the microscopic degrees of freedom of horizons. Singularity resolution gives rise to a quantum extension of classical spacetimes, creating new paradigms for black hole evaporation in which the evolution is unitary. Finally, several possibili- ties have been proposed to test LQG ideas in astrophysics and cosmology. They all involve additional assumptions hypotheses beyond mainstream LQG. Nonetheless, the very fact that relation to observations can be contemplated, sometimes through detailed calculations, provides a measure of the maturity of the subject.  The purpose of this Introduction is twofold:  i  To provide a global overview to aid the beginning researcher navigate through Parts II and III, especially by comparing and contrasting ideas in individual Chapters; and,  ii  Supplement the detailed discussions in these Parts with a brief discussion of a few general, concep- tually important points. To keep the bibliography to a manageable size, we will refer only to reviews and monographs  rather than research articles  where further details can be found. We urge the beginning readers to read this Introduction ﬁrst, as it spells out the overall viewpoint and motivation that is often taken for granted in individual Chapters.  The Setting  In LQG one adopts the viewpoint that among fundamental forces of Nature, gravity is special: it is encoded in the very geometry of spacetime. This is a central feature of GR, a crystallization of the equivalence principle that lies at the heart of the theory. Therefore, one argues, it should be incorporated at a fundamental level in a viable quantum theory.  The perturbative treatments which dominated the ﬁeld since the 1960s ignored this aspect of gravity. They assumed that the underlying spacetime can be taken to be a continuum, endowed with a smooth background geometry, and the quantum gravitational ﬁeld can be treated as any other quantum ﬁeld on this background. But the resulting perturbation theory around Minkowski spacetime turned out to be non-renormalizable; the strategy failed to achieve the initial goals. The new strategy is to free oneself of the background spacetime continuum that seemed indispensable for formulating and addressing physical questions. In particular, in contrast to approaches developed by particle physicists, one does not begin with   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 7  An Overview  7  quantum matter on a background geometry and then use perturbation theory to incorporate quantum eﬀects of gravity. Matter and geometry are both quantum- mechanical at birth. There is often an underlying manifold but no metric, or indeed any other physical ﬁelds, in the background.a  In classical gravity, Riemannian geometry provides the appropriate mathemat- ical language to formulate the physical, kinematical notions as well as the ﬁnal dynamical equations. This role is now taken by quantum Riemannian geometry. In the classical domain, general relativity stands out as the best available theory of gravity, some of whose predictions have been tested to an amazing degree of accu- racy, surpassing even the legendary tests of quantum electrodynamics. Therefore, it is natural to ask: Does quantum general relativity, coupled to suitable matter exist as a consistent theory non-perturbatively? There is no implication that such a theory would be the ﬁnal, complete description of Nature. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating and important open question in its own right.  ±  In particle physics circles the answer to this question is often assumed to be in the negative, not because there is concrete evidence against non-perturbative quantum gravity, but because of the analogy to the theory of weak interactions. There, one ﬁrst had a 4-point interaction model due to Fermi which works quite well at low energies but which fails to be renormalizable. Progress occurred not by looking for non-perturbative formulations of the Fermi model but by replacing the model by the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg renormalizable theory of electro-weak interactions, in which the 4-point interaction is replaced by W and Z propagators. Therefore, it is often assumed that perturbative non-renormalizability of quantum general relativity points in a similar direction. However this argument overlooks the crucial fact that, in the case of general relativity, there is a qualitatively new element. Perturbative treatments pre-suppose that the spacetime can be assumed to be a continuum at all scales of interest to physics under consideration. This assumption is safe for weak interactions. In the gravitational case, on the other hand, the scale of interest is the Planck length  cid:9 Pl and there is no physical basis to pre-suppose that the continuum picture should be valid down to that scale. The failure of the standard perturbative treatments may largely be due to this grossly incorrect assumption and a non-perturbative treatment which correctly incorporates the physical micro-structure of geometry may well be free of these inconsistencies. Are there any situations, outside loop quantum gravity, where such physical expectations are borne out in detail mathematically? The answer is in the aﬃrma- tive. There exist quantum ﬁeld theories  such as the Gross-Neveu model in three dimensions  in which the standard perturbation expansion is not renormalizable although the theory is exactly soluble [5]! Failure of the standard perturbation ex- pansion can occur because one insists on perturbing around the trivial, Gaussian  aIn 2+1 dimensions, although one begins in a completely analogous fashion, in the ﬁnal pic- ture one can get rid of the background manifold as well. Thus, the fundamental theory can be formulated combinatorially [4]. In 3+1 dimensions, combinatorial descriptions emerge in several approaches to dynamics but one does not yet have a complete theory.

Pullin  point rather than the more physical, non-trivial ﬁxed point of the renormalization group  RG  ﬂow. Interestingly, thanks to developments in the Asymptotic Safety program there is now growing evidence that situation may be similar in quantum general relativity [6]. Although there are some basic diﬀerences [7] between LQG and the Asymptotic Safety program, these results provide concrete support to the idea that non-perturbative treatments of quantum general relativity can lead to an ultraviolet regular theory.b  However, even if the LQG program could be carried out to completion, there is no a priori reason to assume that the result would be the ‘ﬁnal’ theory of all known physics. In particular, as is the case with classical general relativity, while requirements of background independence and general covariance do restrict the form of interactions between gravity and matter ﬁelds and among matter ﬁelds themselves, the theory would not have a built-in principle which determines these interactions. Put diﬀerently, such a theory may not be a satisfactory candidate for uniﬁcation of all known forces. However, just as general relativity has had powerful implications in spite of this limitation in the classical domain, LQG should have qualitatively new predictions, pushing further the existing frontiers of physics. Indeed, uniﬁcation does not appear to be an essential criterion for usefulness of a theory even in other interactions. QCD, for example, is a powerful theory even though it does not unify strong interactions with electro-weak ones. Furthermore, the fact that we do not yet have a viable candidate for grand uniﬁed theory does not make QCD any less useful. Finally, as the three Chapters in Part 3 illustrate, LQG has already made interesting predictions for quantum physics of black holes and the very early universe, some of which are detailed and make direct contact with observations.  Quantum Riemannian Geometry  Since the basic dynamical variable in general relativity is the spacetime metric, Wheeler advocated the view that we should regard it as geometrodynamics, a dy- namical theory of 3-metrics qab that constitute the conﬁguration variable. For the three other basic forces of Nature, on the other hand, the dynamical variable is a connection 1-form that takes values in the Lie algebra of the appropriate inter- nal group. In QED the connection enables one to parallel transport electrons and positrons while in QCD it serves as the vehicle to parallel transport quarks. Now the conﬁguration variable is a spatial connections Ai a; we have theories of connection- dynamics. Weinberg, in particular, has emphasized that this diﬀerence has driven a ‘wedge between general relativity and the theory of elementary particles’ [9].  As described in Chapter 1, the starting point in LQG is a reformulation of general relativity as a dynamical theory of spin connections [4]. We now know that  bIn the Asymptotic Safety program, spacetime geometry in the Planck regime is eﬀectively 2-dimensional as in LQG and the 4-dimensional continuum arises only in the low energy limit [6].   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 9  An Overview  9  the idea can be traced back to Einstein and Schr¨odinger who, among others, had recast general relativity as a theory of connections already in the ﬁfties.  For a brief account of this fascinating history, see [10].  However, they used the ‘Levi- Civita connection’ that features in the parallel transport of vectors and found that the theory becomes rather complicated. The situation is very diﬀerent with self- dual  or anti-self-dual  spin connections. For example, the dynamical evolution dictated by Einstein’s equations can now be visualized simply as a geodesic motion on the ‘superspace’ of spin-connections  with respect to a natural metric extracted from the constraint equations . Furthermore, the  anti- self-dual connections have a direct physical interpretation: they are the vehicles used to parallel transport spinors with deﬁnite helicities of the standard model. With this formulation of gen- eral relativity, Weinberg’s ‘wedge’ disappears. In particular, phase-space of general relativity is now the same as that of gauge theories of the other three forces of Na- ture [4, 11]. However, in the Lorentzian signature, the  anti- self-dual connections are complex-valued and, so far, this fact has been a road-block in the construction of a rigorous mathematical framework in the passage to the quantum theory.c There- fore, the strategy is to pass to real connection variables by performing a canonical transformation [1–3]. The canonical transformation introduces a real, dimension- less constant γ, referred to as the Barbero-Immirzi parameter; the  anti-  self-dual Hamiltonian framework is recovered by formally setting γ = ±i.  For real connection variables the ‘internal gauge group’ reduces to SU 2 , which is compact. Therefore, as explained in Chapter 1, it is possible to introduce integral and diﬀerential calculus on the inﬁnite-dimensional space of  generalized  connec- tions rigorously without having to introduce background geometrical ﬁelds, such as a metric. Since this space serves as the quantum conﬁguration space, one can introduce a Hilbert space of square integrable functions and physically interesting self-adjoint operators thereon. This setup then serves as the kinematical framework in LQG.d  The most important features of this background independent framework are the following. First, just as one has the von-Neumann uniqueness theorem in quantum  cAt a formal level in which one often works in quantum ﬁeld theory  QFT , one can carry out calculations with complex connections. The road block refers to rigorous mathematical con- structions. Speciﬁcally, with complex connections, it has not been possible to introduce measures and develop diﬀerential geometry on the inﬁnite dimensional space of generalized connections that serve as the quantum conﬁguration space. However, as is the standard practice in constructive QFT, it may be possible to work in the Riemannian signature where  anti- self-dual connections are real and then pass to the Lorentzian theory through a generalized Wick transform that does exist [3]. This is an opportunity for future research.  dIn rigorous QFT in Minkowski space, while the set of smooth ﬁelds that constitute the classical conﬁguration space is topologically dense in the quantum conﬁguration space on which wave functions live, the quantum measure is concentrated on genuinely distributional ﬁelds. In LQG the situation is similar. Smooth connections are topologically dense in the space of generalized ones but contained in a set of measure zero. This level of rigor is essential if the kinematical framework is to serve as the point of departure for quantum dynamics. It was never attained in geometrodynamics — the Wheeler-DeWitt framework has remained entirely formal.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 10  10  A. Ashtekar & J. Pullin  mechanics of a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom that singles out the standard Schr¨odinger representation, there are uniqueness theorems that single out this kine- matical framework. This is a highly non-trivial result because the system has an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, made possible only because the requirement of background independence is very stringent. Second, in this framework, geomet- ric operators describing the quantum Riemannian geometry have purely discrete eigenvalues. This is a striking and unforeseen outcome, given that the point of de- parture is standard general relativity. For example, this discreteness is not shared by quantum geometrodynamics  i.e., by the Wheeler-DeWitt theory .  There is a basis in the LQG kinematical Hilbert space which is well-suited to analyze properties of these geometric operators: the spin network basis [1–3]. The notion of spin networks was introduced by Penrose already in 1971 in a combina- torial approach to the Euclidean 3-geometry. This notion was generalized in LQG. Now spin networks are labelled by graphs in which any number of links can meet at nodes and both inks and nodes carry certain information — called ‘decorations’ or ‘colors’ This kinematics brings out the precise sense in which the fundamental excitations of  spatial  geometry in LQG are 1-dimensional, polymer like. Consider for simplicity graphs which have only 4-valent nodes — i.e. in which precisely 4 links meet at each node. Then, one can introduce a simplicial decomposition of the 3-manifold which is dual to the graph: Each node of the graph is contained in a single tetrahedron and each link of the graph associated with that node intersects precisely one face of that tetrahedron. The ‘decoration’ on the links assigns speciﬁc quantized areas to faces of tetrahedra and the ‘decoration’ at the node determines the volume of that tetrahedron. Thus, each topological tetrahedron can be regarded as an ‘atom of space’, characterized by the decorations. The volumes of tetrahedra and areas of its faces endow them with geometrical properties. But these geometries are not induced by smooth metrics on the 3-manifold. One thinks of the familiar continuum Riemannian geometries as ‘emergent’, arising from a coarse graining of the fundamental quantum geometry.  Of particular interest is the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator, √ called the area gap whose value in Planck units is denoted by Δ. It turns out that 3πγ. Therefore one Δ depends linearly on the Barbero-Immirzi parameter: Δ = 4 can trade one for the other. Conceptually, it is appropriate to regard γ as a ‘mathe- matical parameter’ that features in the transition from classical to quantum theory, and Δ as the ‘physical parameter’ that sets the scale at which quantum geometry eﬀects become important. Thus, from the perspective of the ﬁnal quantum theory Δ is the fundamental physical parameter. For example, in Loop Quantum Cosmol- ogy  LQC  of homogeneous isotropic models, energy density has a maximum value  given by ρmax =  18π Δ3  ρPl and as Δ → 0, i.e., as we ignore quantum geometry eﬀects, we recover the classical result ρmax → ∞. This is completely analogous to the ground state energy is given by E0 = − me4 2 cid:2 2  and E0 → −∞, the classical  the situation for the energy spectrum of the Hydrogen atom in quantum mechanics:   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 11  An Overview  11  value, as  cid:2  → 0. More generally, one should formulate physical questions in terms of √ 3π  in expressions of interest. In the older LQC literature, Δ, replacing γ by Δ  4 some confusion arose because one took the limit Δ → 0, keeping γ ﬁxed in expres- sions that also involved γ. Similarly, the discussion of black hole entropy becomes signiﬁcantly clearer if everything is formulated in terms of Δ. In particular, since it is physically clear that the microcanonical calculations of entropy using Planck scale quantum geometry should have a dependence on the value of the area gap, one is not tempted to ﬁnd arguments to make it independent of γ.e  The quantum geometry framework is described in detail in Chapter 1 and lies  at the foundation of issues discussed in later Chapters.  Non-perturbative, Background-independent Dynamics  Chapters 2-5 summarize the current status of dynamics in full LQG from both the Hamiltonian and path integral perspectives.  In the early years of LQG the primary focus was on considering general rela- tivity as a constrained Hamiltonian theory — but not in terms of 3-metrics and extrinsic curvature, but rather in terms of spin connections and their canonically conjugate momenta, the spatial triads  with density weight 1 . Because the phase space is the same as in an SU 2  Yang-Mills theory, one could import into gravity the well-developed techniques from gauge theories. However, unlike the familiar Yang-Mills theory in Minkowski spacetime, now there is no metric or any other ﬁeld in the background. In particular, expressions of general relativity constraints involve only the dynamical phase space variables. Since there are no ﬁducial geo- metric structures, and coordinates themselves can be rescaled arbitrarily without aﬀecting underlying physics, techniques used in Minkowskian quantum ﬁeld theo- ries to regulate products of ﬁeld operators are no longer useful. Therefore a number of novel and astute techniques had to be developed to construct the physical sec- tor of the theory by imposing quantum constraints a la Dirac in the background independent kinematical framework of Chapter 1.  In the Hamiltonian framework this is equivalent to solving quantum Einstein’s equations.  These developments are discussed in Chapter 2. However, as discussed there, to make the constraint operators well-deﬁned in the rigorous setting provided by the kinematical frame- work, one had to introduce a number of auxiliary structures. This is not surprising by itself; such constructions are also needed to regulate products of operators in Minkowskian quantum ﬁeld theories. However, in LQG the ﬁnal physical sector of the theory depended on the scheme chosen and the physical meaning of these diﬀerences remained opaque.  eIn semi-classical considerations, arguments are restricted to states representing ‘near horizon, classical geometries’ and one calculates entropy using canonical and micro-canonical ensembles. Then the ﬁnal result can be insensitive to the area gap Δ.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 12  12  A. Ashtekar & J. Pullin  What was needed was a principle to streamline the calculations and reduce the available freedom. Perhaps the most natural and most attractive of these principles is to demand that the quantum constraint algebra should be closed not only on quantum states that satisfy all or some of the constraints, but on the full kine- matical state space. The regularization strategies used in the 1990s could not shed light on this issue of ‘oﬀ-shell closure’ of quantum constraints. Over the past ﬁve years or so, this idea is being systematically implemented in models with increasing complexity. The task is technically diﬃcult. A key idea is to use the fact that, in connection dynamics, the diﬃcult Hamiltonian constraint can be regarded as a diﬀeomorphism constraint in which the shift ﬁelds themselves have certain speciﬁc dependence on the phase space variables i.e., so called ‘q-number’ quantities.  This simpliﬁcation does not occur in geometrodynamics, where the two constraints have entirely diﬀerent forms.   Therefore eﬀort is directed to constructing quantum operators that generate inﬁnitesimal  generalized  diﬀeomorphisms.  In the early LQG works one only had operators implementing ﬁnite and ‘c-number’ diﬀeomorphisms.  The strategy works in simpler models such as parametrized ﬁeld theories, which were invented to mimic features associated with background independence of general relativity. In these theories, the new LQG techniques have enabled one to overcome some long standing obstacles and construct a satisfactory quantum theory with fundamental discreteness as well as covariance. These ideas have also been successfully applied to certain models that arise from simpliﬁcations of general relativity. In these systems, the freedom in quantization is neatly streamlined by the requirement of ‘oﬀ-shell’ closure of quantum constraints. These systematic advances, summarized in Chapter 2, have opened concrete directions to complete the Dirac program in the framework of connection dynamics.  Chapter 3 introduces the basics of spin foams, the sum over histories approach which has been a primary focus of recent work on quantum dynamics [12, 13]. Recall that in his original derivation of path integrals, Feynman began with the expressions of transition amplitudes in Schr¨odinger quantum mechanics and reformulated them as an integral over all kinematically allowed paths [14]. In background independent theories, on the other hand, we have a constrained Hamiltonian framework. As we saw above, in the Dirac program, physical states simply solve the quantum constraints and one has to tease out dynamics, e.g., by introducing a relational time variable. Therefore, on formally mimicking the Feynman procedure starting from the Hamiltonian framework, one ﬁnds that the analog of the transition amplitude is an extraction amplitude. This is a Green’s function that extracts from ‘incoming’  or ‘outgoing’  kinematical states, solutions to quantum constraints and also provides the physical inner product between them. Thus, path integrals provide an alternate, covariant avenue to construct the physical Hilbert space of the theory. If the theory can be deparametrized, it inherits a relational time variable and then the extraction   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 13  An Overview  13  amplitude can be re-interpreted as a transition amplitude with respect to that time.f Irrespective of whether this is possible, the basic object that encodes quantum dynamics is the extraction amplitude.  In heuristic treatments of sum over histories, kinematical paths are generally represented by smooth classical ﬁelds. However, in rigorous QFT it is well known that these paths are contained in a set of measure zero; the measure is concentrated on genuinely distributional ﬁelds. Situation is very similar in LQG: the measure is concentrated on generalized connections rather than smooth ones  see footnote  d  . Consequently in spin foams the sum is over quantum spacetime geometries rather than smooth metrics. These are represented by ‘decorated’ 2-complexes that can be heuristically thought of as ‘time evolution’ of spin networks. Quantum geometries associated with a given 2-complex can be regarded as paths that in- terpolate between given ‘incoming’ and ‘outgoing’ spin networks, the ‘decorations’ providing speciﬁc spacetime quantum geometries which are described in some detail in Chapter 3.  In any given 2-complex,  zero-dimensional  nodes of the ‘incoming’ spin network ‘evolve’ into  one-dimensional  edges, but every now and then a vertex is created characterizing a ‘non-trivial happening’. There is no time, yet ‘happenings’ are objectively coded in each quantum history. Each ‘decorated’ 2-complex carries a ﬁxed number of such happenings but can represent many diﬀerent quantum geome- tries depending on the choice of decorations. In any choice of decorations, areas of 2-dimensional faces are quantized and there is a minimum non-zero area — the area gap. Thus, properties of the underlying quantum geometry provide a natural ultraviolet cut oﬀ. To carry out the path integral, one has to assign amplitudes to the faces and vertices of the 2-complex. The non-trivial part turns out to be the speciﬁcation of the vertex amplitude. The ﬁrst concrete prescription was given in the Barrett-Crane model which opened up the ﬁeld of spin foams. However, later attempts to calculate the graviton propagator in Minkowski spacetime starting from non-perturbative spin foams revealed some important limitations of this model. It was replaced by the Engle–Pereira-Rovelli-Livine  EPRL  and  the closely related  Freidel-Krasnov  FK  models. In these models, the built-in, natural cut oﬀ makes the integral over ‘decorations’ ultraviolet ﬁnite in any given 2-complex. It is unlikely that there is an analogous infrared ﬁniteness in general relativity with zero cosmo- logical constant. However, in presence of a positive cosmological constant, one is naturally led to replace the SU 2  group of internal rotations  of spinors  with its quantum analog SU 2 q and the amplitudes have been shown to be infrared ﬁnite as well.  f In LQC these steps have been carried out rigorously in the Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson- Walker  FLRW  as well as Bianchi I models. That is, one can begin with the well-deﬁned Hamilto- nian quantum theory and arrive at the covariant cosmological spin foam, obtain the exact Green’s function for the extraction amplitude, show that it admits a ‘vertex expansion’ that is convergent, and interpret the extraction amplitude as a transition amplitude by an appropriate deparameter- ization [15].   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 14  14  A. Ashtekar & J. Pullin  In full LQG, of course, one must go beyond a single 2-complex and consider ‘all possible’ 2-complexes interpolating between the two spin networks, allowing for an arbitrary number of vertices. Chapters 4 and 5 summarize two complementary but diﬀerent approaches to fulﬁll this task.  Chapter 4 presents a more general view of sum over histories which, at ﬁrst, seems very diﬀerent from spin foams but in fact ﬁrst arose as a ‘generalized Fourier transform’ from spin foam models. The point of departure is neither a Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity as in the canonical approach, nor a ‘constrained topological theory’ with which one starts in spin foams. Not only are there no back- ground ﬁelds such as a metric but there is no spacetime manifold at a fundamental level. The underlying idea is that gravity is to emerge from a more fundamental theory based on abstract structures that, to begin with, have nothing to do with spacetime geometry. Drawing inspiration from the matrix models  in 2 spacetime dimensions  and especially the ‘Boulatov-model’  in 3 spacetime dimensions  the fundamental object is a QFT but formulated on a group manifold, rather than spacetime. Therefore the framework is aptly called ‘Group Field Theory’  GFT . As in familiar ﬁeld theories, the Lagrangian has a free and an interaction term, with a coupling constant λ. Even though the point of departure appears to be so diﬀerent, one can again use the LQG kinematics and represent the ‘in’ and the ‘out’ states by spin networks as in spin foams.g Remarkably, for a certain choice of the Lagrangian, the n-th term in the perturbation expansion — i.e., the coeﬃcient of λn — is the same as the contribution to the extraction amplitude obtained by ﬁx- ing a 2-complex with precisely n vertices, and summing over the decorations in the EPRL model. But because it arises in a standard perturbation expansion — albeit on a group manifold, not spacetime — one can now borrow techniques from stan- dard QFT. This is especially important in order to  i  go beyond a single 2-complex  i.e., a ﬁxed number of vertices ; and  ii  analyze potentially distinct phases, as in standard QFT.  In this summary we have presented GFT from the perspective of Hamiltonian and spin foam LQG  although, as explained in Chapter 4, there are also some tech- nical diﬀerences . However, GFT oﬀers greater generality. For example, GFT nat- urally suggests quantum LQG dynamics of a more general, ‘grandcanonical’ type in which the number of vertices is allowed to vary. It also opens avenues to discuss the ‘continuum limit’ using ideas in the spirit of the thermodynamic limit in quantum ﬁeld theories. In addition, it suggests that even if one begins with GFT actions corresponding to, say, the EPRL model, under the RG ﬂow quantum dynamics  gEach spin network captures only a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom of the quantum grav- itational ﬁeld which can be interpreted as a ‘twisted geometry’. In GFT, one often says that they represent a ‘ﬁrst quantized’ theory. The full GFT has operators that create spin network states and is therefore regarded as a ‘second quantized’ theory. This terminology is not used outside GFT and ‘second quantization’ should not be interpreted as going beyond LQG: LQG has the same underlying mathematical structures.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 15  An Overview  15  will generate many more terms at diﬀerent scales, providing new scale dependent physics. Finally, the framework is so general that it may even allow a departure from a fundamental tenet of the rest of LQG that there are no degrees of freedom beyond the Planck scale. Thus, like QFT in Minkowski spacetime, GFT oﬀers a general paradigm, rather than a physical theory. To specify a physical theory, one has to choose a set of ﬁelds — now on a group manifold — and ﬁx interactions be- tween them. Hence its scope diﬀers from the more focused approaches to quantum dynamics discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. In recent years the emphasis has been on exploiting the generality it oﬀers by applying the ideas to speciﬁc models. As in Chapter 2, it has been successfully applied to simpler systems. The state of the art can be summarized by saying that GFT has opened a number of new avenues that have the potential to resolve the key open issues in 4-dimensional spin foams.  Finally, in Chapter 5 we return to the important open issue of the continuum limit in spin foams, which is now taken using a generalization of the standard RG ﬂow induced by reﬁnements in the spacetime manifold in the spirit of lattice QCD, rather than through a ﬁeld theory on a group manifold. Here, one uses methods from lattice QFT, functional analysis and tensor networks, rather than perturbative expansions in coupling constants together with techniques from non-perturbative QFTs, used in GFT. More precisely, the physical states — i.e., solutions of the quantum constraint — are to be constructed by taking the reﬁnement limit in spacetime.  Let us begin with the kinematical setup of Chapter 1. The strategy employed there is to ﬁrst deﬁne structures, such as the scalar product between states and action of geometric and holonomy operators on them, using the ﬁnite degrees of freedom that are captured in a single graph. These structures then naturally extend to the full state space in the continuum that captures all the inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom provided they satisfy stringent consistency conditions as one coarse grains or reﬁnes graphs by adding new nodes and links. These are the so-called cylindrical consistency conditions [1]. Quantum geometry has been successfully constructed in the kinematical setting precisely because these cylindrical consistency requirements were met. The idea now is to promote these consistency requirements to dynamics, using spin foams of Chapter 3.  One can start with a ﬁxed simplicial decomposition of the spacetime manifold together with its dual 2-complex. The 2-complex induces spin network states on the initial and ﬁnal 3-manifolds which can be regarded as the ‘in’ and ‘out’ quantum states of geometry  or, more precisely, simply kinematic states out of which one wishes to extract physical ones . As noted above, a spin foam model provides a ‘transition amplitude’ between them  or, more precisely, a Green’s function that extracts a physical state from the two given kinematical ones . The idea is that one should consider only those reﬁnements  and coarse grainings  of the simplicial decomposition — and hence of the dual 2-complex — that make the procedure   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 16  16  A. Ashtekar & J. Pullin  cylindrically consistent, so that physics at diﬀerent ‘scales’ is appropriately related to constitute a coherent scheme. This is the sense in which the notion of cylindrical consistency is to be promoted from the kinematical to the dynamical setting. A reﬁnement procedure that meets the consistency conditions would then provide a generalization of the RG ﬂow ideas to a setting in which there is no background metric to deﬁne the scale. The question of whether such a reﬁnement limit exists is similar to the asymptotic safety conjecture that an ultraviolet ﬁxed point exists. In the same spirit as asymptotic safety, once the program is developed beyond pure gravity, the hope is that cylindrical consistency will severely constrain matter couplings since it is a stringent requirement.  Chapter 5 explains these consistency conditions and also the inductive limit that is to provide the ﬁnal quantum dynamics in the continuum limit through an admissible reﬁnement. Again, as in Chapters 2 and 4, the procedure has been successfully applied to simpler models, now involving decorated tensor networks and an iterative procedure. The general viewpoint in LQG is that the so called Ashtekar-Lewandowski  AL  representation  of the fundamental LQG quantum al- gebra  underlying the kinematic setup correctly captures the essential features of quantum geometry at Planck scale. But by loosening the requirements that led to the uniqueness of this representation, one can construct a ‘dual’ description, called the BF representation. General arguments have been put forward to suggest that it may be more directly useful for describing the phase of the theory containing macroscopic, continuum geometries. Each of these representations has a vacuum state and the two vacua are very diﬀerent from one another. An important feature of the overall strategy is that the truncation scheme is to be determined by dy- namics. ‘Coarse states’ will have few excitations while ‘ﬁne states’ will have many excitations with respect to a vacuum that is also determined by dynamics.  This approach to continuum limit has several attractive features. First, the pro- cedure brings out a close relation between the the continuum quantum dynamics and spacetime diﬀeomorphism symmetry in systems with  auxiliary  discrete struc- tures, reﬂecting the intuitive idea that the diﬀeomorphism symmetry allows one to reﬁne or coarse grain any region. Second, it provides a background independent analog of a ‘complete renormalization trajectory’ through the notion of cylindrically consistent amplitudes. Finally, the procedure already has the necessary ingredients in place to lead to the running of coupling constants, once the system is extended to allow for matter sources. As in Chapters 2 and 4, this is an ongoing program; now the open question is whether cylindrically consistent amplitudes exist in full 4-dimensional LQG.  Applications  While important issues remain in full LQG, the basic underlying ideas have been successfully applied to two physical sectors of full gravity: black holes and the very early universe. Part 3 of this volume summarize these advances.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 17  An Overview  17  Cosmic microwave background  CMB  observations have established that the early universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic to one part in 105. Therefore the current paradigms of the early universe assume that spacetime geometry is well described by a Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker  FLRW  geometry, together with ﬁrst order perturbations prior to the CMB epoch. Although we do not yet have a deﬁnitive paradigm, the inﬂationary scenario has emerged as the leading candidate. In particular, it has been very successful in accounting for the one part in 105 inhomogeneities observed in the CMB. Known physics and astrophysics show that these inhomogeneities serve as seeds for formation of the large scale structure we see in the universe. Thus, inﬂation pushes the issue of the origin of the observed large scale structure further back from the CMB epoch — in fact to very early times, when the spacetime curvature was some 1062 times that at the surface of a solar mass black hole! While this is truly impressive, from the viewpoint of quantum gravity this epoch lies in the classical general relativity regime since the curvature −14 times the Planck curvature. That is why it is consistent — as is still some 10 is done in all current paradigms of the early universe scenario — to describe the universe using a classical FLRW background and represent the cosmological pertur- bations by quantum ﬁelds propagating on it. However, this strategy is inadequate if one wishes to go to still earlier times and describe what happened when the matter density and curvature were of Planck scale. For this, one needs a quantum theory of gravity. The inadequacy of standard inﬂation is brought out by two facts:  i  the big-bang singularity persists in this theory, and all physics comes to a halt there; and  ii  quantum ﬁeld theory on FLRW backgrounds, used to describe the dynamics of cosmological perturbations, becomes inadequate because even modes that can be observed in the CMB acquire trans-Planckian frequencies in the early epoch. Thus, a challenge to any candidate quantum gravity theory is to provide a completion of the inﬂationary scenario over the 11 orders of magnitude in matter density and curvature that separate it from the Planck scale and successfully address these is- sues. As Chapter 6 describes, in LQG there have been remarkable advances in this direction.  Let us begin with the ﬁrst issue — that of the resolution of the big-bang singu- larity in the background spacetime. In LQG cosmological singularities are resolved in all models that have been studied so far. These include the ﬂat and closed FLRW models with and without a cosmological constant  of either sign ; the anisotropic Bianchi models that contain non-linear gravitational waves; and the inhomogeneous Gowdy models which also contain non-linear gravitational waves [15]. The resolu- tion does not come about by introducing matter that violates energy conditions or by some ﬁne tuning. The origin of the mechanism can be traced back directly to the underlying quantum geometry — particularly the emergence of the area gap — described in Chapter 1. Quantum geometry creates a brand new repulsive force. It is completely negligible already at the onset of inﬂation and thereafter. However if   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 18  18  A. Ashtekar & J. Pullin  we evolve back in time, it grows rapidly, overwhelms the classical attraction in the Planck regime, and causes the universe to bounce. Thus the big bang is replaced by a quantum bounce. More generally, the following picture succinctly summarizes the salient features of quantum dynamics in cosmological models: anytime a curvature invariant starts to grow in general relativity signaling approach to a singularity, the repulsive force grows to dilute it, preventing its formation.  What is behind this singularity resolution? In Loop Quantum Cosmology  LQC  one applies the LQG techniques to the cosmological setting described above. It turns out that even after standard gauge ﬁxing there is still some residual diﬀeomorphism freedom in cosmological models. The requirement of covariance under this freedom — i.e., background dependence in the cosmological context — again leads to a unique representation of the fundamental quantum algebra. As in the AL  or BF  representation for full LQG, the connection operator is not well deﬁned in LQC; only its exponential, the holonomy, is a well deﬁned  unitary  operator. In this LQC representation of quantum states, then,  as in full LQG  one has to express the curvature term in the Hamiltonian constraint in terms of holonomies, now around a loop which encloses the minimum possible physical area deﬁned by the quantum state. As a result the quantum Hamiltonian constraint depends on the area gap and the operator reduces to the Wheeler DeWitt operator of geometrodynamics only in the limit in which the area gap goes to zero. At a fundamental level, there is no time. But in presence of suitable matter, one can deparameterize the theory and interpret the Hamiltonian constraint as an evolution equation in a relational time variable provided, e.g., by matter. One can show that physical  Dirac  observables — such as the energy density or curvature at a given instant of relational time — that diverge at the big bang in general relativity have a ﬁnite upper bound on the entire space of physical states. Thus the singularity is resolved in a very direct, physical sense: There are simply no states in the physical Hilbert space in which matter density diverges. This resolution has been analyzed using Hamiltonian and path integral methods and has also been discussed in the ‘decoherent histories’ framework. Chapter 6 summarizes most of these results and provides references for topics that could not be covered.  Thus, in LQC, the classical FLRW backgrounds  a t , φ t   used in the inﬂation- ary scenario are replaced by a wave function Ψ a, φ  in the physical Hilbert space. Quantum ﬁelds representing the scalar  curvature  and tensor perturbations now propagate on the quantum FLRW geometry Ψ a, φ . Over the last several years, quantum ﬁeld theory on classical FLRW spacetimes was systematically generalized to quantum ﬁeld theory on these quantum FLRW spacetimes. This generalization enables one to face the ‘trans-Planckian issues’ squarely and has therefore been used to analyze dynamics of the scalar and tensor modes through the Planck regime, all the way to the quantum bounce. This analysis, as well as other methods described in Chapter 8, have led to interesting phenomenological predictions that can be tested against observations.

Quantum geometry eﬀects that tame the singularity provide a new ul- traviolet LQC length scale  cid:9 LQC, the minimum curvature radius — corresponding to the maximum scalar curvature at the bounce. Modes of perturbations whose physical wavelength λphys is larger than  cid:9 LQC experience curvature during their evolution in the Planck regime near the bounce and are excited. These turn out to have the longest wavelength among the modes seen in the CMB observations. Thus, dynamics in the Planck regime can leave imprints at the largest angular scales in the sky. Detailed calculations have been performed to use this eﬀect to account for the anomalies that the PLANCK and WMAP teams have found at the largest angular scales in CMB. Furthermore, predictions have been made for other correlation func- tions that should soon be reported by the PLANCK team for the largest angular scales. Thus, LQC has been a fertile ground within LQG. It has led to a concrete and detailed realization of several key underlying ideas — use of relational time, construction of a complete set of Dirac observables, relation between the canonical framework and spin foams, and the hope that the vertex expansion in spin foams is convergent. At the same time, it has brought quantum gravity from lofty heights of mathematical physics to concrete, observational issues in phenomenology.  Chapter 7 summarizes results on the black hole sector of LQG. Just as the early universe provides us with possibly the best opportunity of directly observing quantum gravity eﬀects, black holes provide us with possibly the best arena to test quantum gravity theories at a conceptual level. Speciﬁcally any viable quantum gravity has to address two issues in the black hole sector. The ﬁrst arises from black hole thermodynamics. Einstein equations within classical general relativity inform us that black holes obey certain laws: the zeroth refers to equilibrium conﬁg- urations, the ﬁrst to transition from an equilibrium state to a nearby one, and the second to full dynamical situations. Remarkably, these laws become the zeroth, the ﬁrst and the second laws of thermodynamics if one identiﬁes a multiple of the surface gravity κ of the horizon with temperature T , and  1  8π G  times  the reciprocal multiple of the horizon area AH with  Bekenstein-Hawking  entropy SBH. However, purely from dimensional grounds one ﬁnds that the multiple must have the same dimensions as  cid:2 , bringing in quantum mechanics in a totally unforeseen fashion. Subsequent calculation, using quantum ﬁeld theory in the Schwarzschild black hole spacetime, established the Hawking eﬀect: Black holes evaporate quantum mechan- ically and at late times the outgoing state is extremely well approximated by the thermal radiation from a black body at the  Hawking  temperature TH = κ cid:2  2π. These discoveries, made over 4 decades ago, make it clear that black holes hold a key to bring together the three pillars of physics — general relativity, thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. They imply that a solar mass black hole has exp 1077 microstates, an enormous number even on statistical mechanics standards. One is thus immediately led to the question: Can we account for the enormous horizon   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 20  20  A. Ashtekar & J. Pullin  entropy SBH using more fundamental statistical mechanical considerations? The second issue concerns the dynamics of the evaporation process. What happens in a self-consistent treatment when one includes back reaction so that, by energy con- servation, the black hole mass decreases? Does the horizon evaporate completely? The black hole may have been formed by sending in a variety of, say, pure states. Are we left with particles in a thermal state at the end of evaporation? If so, the evaporation process would not be unitary and information would be lost. Even after four decades, there are no clear answers to this second set of questions in any approach to quantum gravity. Therefore Chapter 7 focuses only to the ﬁrst set of issues in this section.  Event horizons that one normally associates with black holes are extremely global as well as teleological notions. For example, they can form and grow in a ﬂat, Minkowskian region of a spacetime. Similarly, they can be gotten rid of simply by changing spacetime geometry in a tiny neighborhood of the singularity. Further- more, it is not unlikely that the spacetime describing an evaporating black hole has an event horizon. Calculations with 2-dimensional black holes that include the back reaction and solve for geometry using a mean ﬁeld approximation strongly indicate that the full spacetime will not have an event horizon. Therefore, as explained in detail in Chapter 7, in LQG one uses the quasi-local notion of a  weakly  isolated horizon for which the zeroth and the ﬁrst laws of black hole mechanics do hold [16]. An additional advantage is that one can incorporate both the black hole and the cosmological horizons in one swoop, and one does not have to restrict oneself to near extremal black holes.h  In LQG, one focuses on the quantum geometry of isolated horizons. The ‘quanta of geometry’ provide the microstates of the quantum horizon that are used in a statistical mechanical entropy calculation. The subject is mathematically rich. It involves quantum groups, Chern-Simons theory on punctured spheres, mapping class groups and sophisticated techniques from number theory. Detailed calculations show that the number of microstates has interesting properties, especially for small black holes. For large black holes, the entropy SBH is indeed proportional to the horizon area AH but this coeﬃcient is inversely proportional to the area gap Δ of LQG. This is just as one would expect on general grounds. So, as the area gap goes to zero, i.e., we ignore quantum geometry eﬀects, the entropy becomes inﬁnite. However, as a result, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula SBH = AH 4G cid:2  is recovered only for a certain value of the area gap Δ. Put diﬀerently, by demanding that LQG have the correct semi-classical limit to leading order, one can ﬁx the  hTo obtain the second law, one needs dynamical horizons which are also quasi-local notions. While event horizons are null hypersurfaces, dynamical horizons are space-like when the black hole is growing during collapse and time-like when it is evaporating. Unlike event horizons, they are not one way membranes. This fact removes considerable confusion in the literature on the evaporation process. There is strong indication that dynamical horizons do exist for evaporating black holes.  When matter is neither falling into the black hole nor leaving it, the dynamical horizon becomes null and an isolated horizon.  [16]   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 21  An Overview  21  value of the area gap, and hence remove the a priori 1-parameter ambiguity in the kinematical setup of LQG. This general picture is well-established. However, as the discussion in Chapter 7 shows, there are ambiguities in the precise deﬁnition of what constitutes a quantum state of the horizon geometry, primarily because the surface states of the horizon quantum geometry are entangled with states of the bulk quantum geometry. Therefore, at a conceptual level, the subject is not fully settled. However, the ambiguities are all very small to make a diﬀerence in practice: The area gap varies only between 5.16 and 5.96  in Planck units .  These considerations refer to quantum geometry and Planck scale eigenvalues of the area operator. In recent years, there has been a signiﬁcant advance in relating LQG to the vast literature on black hole thermodynamics based on semi-classical considerations. The main idea is to consider the near horizon geometry correspond- ing to that of a stationary black hole solution and shift the perspective to that of a suitable family of near horizon stationary observers. In such geometries, one can relate the energy E, as seen by stationary observers at a distance  cid:9  from the horizon, to the area AH of the horizon, the low energy Newton constant GN and  cid:9 . The ‘semi-classical input’ is the assumption that the physical sector of LQG contains states that are peaked around solutions admitting isolated horizons with such near horizon geometries. Under this assumption, one can use the expression of E and the LQG expression of the area operator ˆAH to construct the Hamiltonian operator. In this step, the Planck length  cid:9 Pl in the expression of the area operator is assumed to be given by  cid:9 2 Pl = G cid:2  where G is the gravitational constant in the Planck regime  which one would expect to run to GN in the low energy regime . Using the Hamiltonian operator  which features G, GN and  cid:9   one can construct a canonical ensemble at the Unruh temperature T = 2π  cid:9  associated with the sta- tionary observers and calculate the entropy. The leading term in the result turns out to be precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, with no extra factor. The dependence on the auxiliary parameter  cid:9  as well as on the area gap Δ drops out of this semi-classical result based on the canonical ensemble tailored to stationary, near horizon observers. The calculation also sheds new light on how the possible running of gravitational constant can be naturally accommodated, even when the Hawking-Bekenstein formula uses the low energy value GN of the gravitational con- stant and the area operator from quantum geometry uses the Planck scale value G.  Finally, there have been a number of other developments. First, using spin foams, entanglement entropy associated with horizons has been re-examined. It has been shown that if one changes focus from entropy to variation of entropy, a lot of unnecessary conceptual and computational baggage is removed. In particular the species problem is alleviated. It has also been suggested that it is the entanglement entropy that features in a precise statement of the ﬁrst law in semi-classical gravity and the idea is under more detailed investigation. Another — and major — direc- tion is a systematic investigation of the quantum geometry underlying a black hole   February 22, 2017 10:18  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 22  22  A. Ashtekar & J. Pullin  spacetime. This has been successfully carried out under the assumption of spheri- cal symmetry. As in cosmological models, the singularity is naturally resolved by quantum geometry eﬀects. Then it is natural to study quantum ﬁelds propagat- ing on this quantum black hole geometry. These investigations bring out how the underlying quantum geometry provides a natural ultraviolet regularization in the QFT calculations. Finally, there are calculations of Hawking eﬀect on the quantum geometry representing a spherically symmetric black hole, again in the test ﬁeld approximation. The quantum nature of the underlying geometry leads to ultra- violet modiﬁcations of the quantum vacua, eliminating the trans-Planckian modes close to the horizon. As a result, expectation value of the stress energy tensor are ultraviolet ﬁnite. Hawking radiation at inﬁnity has been computed and, apart from an ultraviolet cutoﬀ, the outgoing state is the same as the conventional one. In par- ticular, this analysis provides a concrete quantum gravity calculation showing that Hawking radiation is not seriously contaminated by the apparent trans-Planckian problems of QFT in classical, curved spacetimes. Currently, these calculations are being revisited and extended to study the evaporation process.  Chapter 8 covers a broad range of issues related to phenomenology and observa- tions. They include direct and indirect probes into the very early universe, potential for Lorentz invariance violations, modiﬁcations of the spectrum of an evaporating black hole due to the discreteness of area eigenvalues, Planck stars and the possi- bility that the emission from them is related to Gamma ray bursts  GRBs . In the discussion of cosmological probes there is an inevitable, small overlap with Chap- ter 6 but the rest of the material is presented for the ﬁrst time in this volume. The material covered here illustrates the wide scope of current research in LQG, in particular the fact that now there is a signiﬁcant community that is looking beyond foundational, conceptual and mathematical issues into the interface with observations.  Conceptually, perhaps the most ambitious of these ideas is that of ‘Planck stars’ which is now superseded by the more recent work on ‘ﬁreworks’. One knows from quantum cosmology of closed FLRW models that quantum geometry eﬀects dom- inate and cause a quantum bounce once the curvature reaches the Planck scale. The curvature at the surface of a solar mass collapsing star reaches the Planck scale when its radius is ∼ 13 orders of magnitude larger than the Planck length. Thus the view that quantum gravity can drastically modify classical dynamics only when the star has shrunk to the Planck size is unsubstantiated. It is reasonable to suppose that something like a quantum bounce would occur when the curvature at the surface of the star reaches the Planck scale. The question is: What is the time scale — as measured at inﬁnity — that is involved in this bounce? The time scale for the Hawking evaporation goes as M 3. If the time scale for the bounce is smaller, say ∼ M 2, then the bounce would dominate, making Hawking evaporation irrelevant for large black holes. The hope in the program is that something like this   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 23  An Overview  23  does happen. This is a bold conjecture. The LQG group pursuing these ideas is well aware of the fact that extraordinary conjectures require extraordinary proofs and is therefore engaged in building up the necessary evidence through detailed calculations.  Concepts and results that are needed as prerequisites to understand the con- tents of Chapter 8 have already been discussed in this Introduction. Therefore, we will conclude with just one remark. As in other approaches to quantum grav- ity, to make contact with observations, one has to make additional assumptions that are not part of LQG proper, since situations of interest to observations are too complex to be systematically arrived at starting from a fundamental quantum gravity theory. Therefore, observations probe the package consisting of the funda- mental theory being used in calculations, together with the additional assumptions that are made to arrive at phenomenological predictions. This is also the case in other areas of physics, such as QCD. Much of the work on quark-gluon plasmas, for example, makes hydrodynamical assumptions that are physically motivated but are not known to be direct consequences of fundamental QCD. Therefore, if a pre- diction is falsiﬁed, one cannot conclude that there is a problem with QCD; it is much more likely that the problem lies with the additional assumptions. Of course, QCD has absolutely huge observational support compared to any quantum gravity theory. But the general spirit of this research in LQG is the same as that in these other areas: use observations to reﬁne paradigms, assumptions and strategies. If a particularly clean prediction is veriﬁed, it would give conﬁdence in the underlying assumptions and encourage more detailed analysis within that paradigm, leading to further predictions. If observations contradict a prediction, they provide guidance as to which of the assumptions are suspect and need to be weeded out. However, because observational evidence for any quantum gravity theory is scant, one con- stantly keeps an eye on the possibility that the observations are suggesting or even requiring a change in the fundamentals of LQG and LQC.  Closing Remarks  Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of LQG is the underlying quantum geom- etry. Intuitively one expects some sort of discreteness at the Planck scale. Much of the heuristic literature as well as some of the systematic quantum gravity ap- proaches assume that quanta of geometry have a simple structure with lengths that are integral multiples of  cid:9 Pl, and or areas that are integral multiples of  cid:9 2 Pl and or volumes that are integral multiples of  cid:9 3 Pl. The quantum Riemannian geometry of LQG is much more subtle. In particular, the spectra of various geometric operators are quite diﬀerent from one another; for example, one cannot deduce the eigenvalues of the volume operator from those of the area operator. Secondly, while there is an area gap, higher eigenvalues of the area operator crowd and the level spacing decreases exponentially! Consequently the continuum geometry is approached very   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 24  24  A. Ashtekar & J. Pullin  quickly. These speciﬁc features were ﬁrst discovered in the 1990s but remained mathematical curiosities until recently. Now such details are turning out to be important in the interplay between theory and observations.  For example, in the Bekenstein-Mukhanov approach to black hole entropy, area  Pl where g ∼ O 1  can be thought of the degeneracy  eigenvalues are of the type g N  cid:9 2 factor — or, the number of ‘bits’ — in the basic quantum of area. This means that when a black hole is perturbed it makes a transition from an initial state of the horizon characterized by an integer N1, to a ﬁnal state characterized by another integer N2. Therefore, the change ΔA in the horizon area occurs in discrete steps: ΔA = g  N2 − N1  cid:9 2 Pl. Recently, these ideas were re-examined using the relation between area, mass and spin of Kerr black holes, and frequency of quasi-normal modes that describe their ‘ringing’ under perturbations. Speciﬁcally, it was argued that the Bekenstein-Mukhanov proposal leads to a diﬀerent description of ringing and therefore it may soon be under stress once LIGO observes quasi-normal ringing from a suﬃcient number of spinning black holes. By contrast, for black holes of interest to LIGO, the LQG area spectrum becomes almost continuous due to the exponential crowding of eigenvalues. Therefore, there is no reason for predictions to be observationally distinct from those of classical general relativity. Another example comes from cosmology, where one can constrain the value of the area gap Δ from observations. More precisely, one can leave Δ as a free parameter in LQC calculations and obtain the value that makes the predicted power spectrum ﬁt best with the PLANCK mission observations. Recent investigations in LQC have carried out this task, providing a completely independent way of arriving at the value of area gap Δ  and hence of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter γ . The best-ﬁt value of Δ agrees with that obtained from black hole entropy calculations within the 68% conﬁdence level used by the PLANCK mission to report its data. LQG researchers who ﬁrst investigated geometric operators in the 1990s did not anticipate that the details they carefully worked out would start making a diﬀerence on observational fronts within just two decades.  For quantum dynamics in full LQC, a number of important issues remain. The conceptual framework and mathematical techniques introduced in the early discus- sions were crucial to get the program rolling. But, with hindsight, we now see that these discussions failed to take into account key issues such as physics at diﬀerent scales, renormalization group ﬂows, and consistency requirements in the continuum limit procedure. That is why the program has not made as much contact with low energy physics as one would have hoped. Now the community is well aware of these limitations and is actively engaged in overcoming them. Chapters 2-5 sum- marize the three directions that are being pursued: Hamiltonian theory a la Dirac, spin foams and their continuum limit, and GFT. While the ﬁnal goal is essentially the same — uncovering dynamics through solutions to the quantum constraints — there are also some diﬀerences and healthy tensions. The Hamiltonian meth- ods of Chapter 2 focus on canonical gravity while methods used in Chapters 3-5   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 25  An Overview  25  come from path integrals. They have complementary strengths and limitations. For example, in terms of concrete results in 4 dimensions, the Hamiltonian meth- ods have been much more useful in the study of the early universe and black hole entropy, while path integral methods have shown how one can obtain the gravi- ton 2-point function in Minkowski space in a background with independent setting. Even within the path integral approaches there are diﬀerences. Roughly, GFT of Chapter 4 is modeled more on methods from QFT, while the continuum limit of spin foams discussed in Chapter 5 generalizes ideas and techniques used in condensed matter physics.  Given the variety of diﬃcult issues one encounters in non-perturbative quantum dynamics, we believe this diversity is essential. It represents a key strength of the program. Existing tensions between these sets of ideas will bring to forefront deeper issues and launch new investigations leading to a more coherent overall framework. In particular, they should lead to advances on two key open issues:  i  Contact with the standard low energy eﬀective theory. The derivation of the graviton 2-point function, for example, has been a major achievement but one needs to make sure that the current calculations are not changed in the leading order by including spin foams with a large number of vertices, or in an appropriate continuum limit. It is also important to obtain higher order corrections in a reliable fashion; and,  ii  Matter couplings. We know that there is no conceptual diﬃculty in incorpo- rating matter either in the Hamiltonian framework [3, 4] or in spin foams [2]. But details have not been worked out. In particular, a satisfactory derivation of the classical limit for gravity interacting with matter is still lacking. It is important to understand whether consistency requirements — such as those used in Chapters 2 and 5 — strongly constrain matter couplings. In these investigations, recent results in the asymptotic safety program may provide guidance.  Finally, results on symmetry reduced models in the study of the early universe and black holes provide important checks on viability of the main ideas underlying LQG. The fact that the program can be completed in these models and that the results successfully address long standing questions of quantum gravity is a non- trivial indication that the program is well-founded.  However, there is always the issue of whether an important aspect of physics is overlooked by ﬁrst focusing on a symmetry reduced sector of the classical the- ory and then passing to the quantum theory. The Dirac model of the hydrogen atom sheds interesting light on this issue. Here one considers the proton-electron system in quantum electrodynamics  QED , truncates the theory to its spherical symmetric sector and then carries out quantization. From the perspective of full QED, the strategy seems to introduce a drastic oversimpliﬁcation since it banishes all the photons right from the start! Indeed, conceptually, the truncated theory does ignore most of the rich possibilities one can envisage in full QED. And yet the Dirac theory provides an excellent description of the hydrogen atom. Indeed,   February 22, 2017 10:18  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 26  26  A. Ashtekar & J. Pullin  to see its limitations, one has to carry out very accurate measurements and care- fully examine the hyperﬁne structure due to QED eﬀects such as the Lamb shift! Returning to quantum gravity, it is not unreasonable to expect that the symmetry reduction strategy would be appropriate provided it keeps an eye on the structure of the full theory, i.e., provided the quantum theory of the reduced model is not constructed in a manner that is speciﬁcally engineered just to ﬁt that model. In LQG this view is taken seriously: quantum theories of reduced models pay due attention to the quantum geometry that emerged from full LQG. Therefore, for the limited class of observables that are needed to describe the very early universe and spherically symmetric black holes, the varied and rich possibilities of full quantum gravity could just reﬁne, rather than alter, the predictions of the reduced models. Of course there is no a priori guarantee that this will be the case. Therefore, over the past 2-3 years there has been an increased eﬀort on ﬁnding the precise relation between the symmetry reduced quantum theories and full LQG. In particular, there are strong results showing that the LQC faithfully captures the LQG kinematics in the homogeneous, isotropic sector. At the dynamical level, there are partial results that go in the same direction.  We will conclude with a few general remarks about this volume. The list of mathematical symbols that appears in the beginning is intended to help readers as they navigate through detailed arguments. It was sent to all authors and by and large they have followed the conventions laid down in that list. There are several senior ﬁgures in LQG who have made invaluable contributions and driven major advances over the past two decades or more. But to provide a fresh perspective that emphasizes future directions, we thought it would be best to invite some of the younger researchers who are currently leading research programs in new directions. We urged them to express their outlook on where we stand and what the strategies are best suited for future advances. Consequently various Chapters express personal visions that sometimes boldly venture beyond the general consensus in the ﬁeld. This is especially the case on some issues of quantum dynamics and at the interface of theory and observations. In this respect, our intention is captured in the best spirit of the motto: ‘let a thousand ﬂowers bloom’. The Editors do not subscribe to all the ideas and views expressed in the 8 Chapters. Rather they feel it is important that beginning researchers be guided by younger leaders who will shape the future of LQG.  References  [1] A. Ashtekar A and J.

I think it must be the case that the all-pervading use of the continuum in physics stems from its mathematical utility rather than from any essential physical reality that it may possess.

Canonical Quantization of General Relativity  encode the dynamics of general relativity. In the context of the ADM-formalism  With their seminal work in 1960 on the canonical formulation of general relativity, which has come to be called the ADM-formalism, Arnowitt, Deser and Misner [1] provided the background for research which focused on the question how general relativity can be quantized using the technique of canonical quantization. In the covariant formulation of general relativity the elementary variable is a Lorentzian metric gμν, where we use the signature  3, 1 , on a four-dimensional diﬀerentiable manifold M. The equation of motion for gμν are given by Einstein’s equations and the four-dimensional space time  M, gμν  is replaced by a 3+1-dimensional pic- ture, using the fact that the topology of globally hyperbolic space times is of the form M  cid:6  R × M [2]. One associates R with time and M with space. Hence, the four-dimensional manifold M is considered as a foliation of three-dimensional space-like hypersurfaces Xt M   labeled by a parameter t ∈ R, where Xt : M → M is an embedding of the spatial manifold M into M. A particular choice of time and space would break diﬀeomorphism invariance and therefore in the framework of the ADM-formalism one does not choose a particular foliation but considers all possible ones. In the canonical framework the elementary conﬁguration variables are the pull back of the metric gμν onto M denoted by qab from now on, also called the ADM 3-metric. The conjugate momenta, denoted by pab, are related to the extrinsic curvature of the space-like hypersurfaces Xt M  . The diﬀeomorphism in- variance of the theory has the consequence that general relativity is a constrained Hamiltonian theory meaning that in addition to the Hamiltonian equation of mo- tion for qab and pab the theory possesses constraints, which are additional equations on phase space, that qab and pab have to satisfy. Therefore the constraints select out of the kinematical degrees of freedom  qab, pab , which still include gauge degrees of freedom, the physical degrees of freedom. In the case of the ADM-formalism these constraints are called Hamiltonian and  spatial  diﬀeomorphism constraint.  31   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 32  32  K. Giesel  The latter generates diﬀeomorphisms within the spatial hypersurface M and the Hamiltonian constraint is generating diﬀeomorphisms orthogonal to the hypersur- face. Note that in the case of the Hamiltonian constraint this is only true on shell, that is when the constraints are satisﬁed, and in addition when the equation of motion are fulﬁlled. Furthermore, general relativity is in this sense special as its Hamiltonian consists entirely of a linear combination of the constraints and there- fore general relativity is called a fully constrained theory. This property has to be taken into account when one discusses the notion of observables, that is gauge invariant quantities, in the context of general relativity, see for instance Refs. [3] and [4].  For theories with constraints there exist two diﬀerent approaches to formulate the quantum theory. First, known as Dirac [5] quantization, is based on the idea of quantizing the entire kinematical phase space, including the gauge degrees of  set. Then the physical sector of the theory is constructed in the quantum theory by  freedom, yielding the so called kinematical Hilbert space Hkin. Let us denote the set of classical constraints by {CI} with I ∈ I where I denotes some arbitrary index implementing all classical constraints {CI} as operators { ˆCI} on Hkin and requiring that physical states ψ be annihilated by all constraints operators, that is ˆCIψ = 0 for all I ∈ I. These physical states are elements of the so called physical Hilbert space Hphys. The second approach called reduced quantization follows the strategy  to solve the constraints already at the classical level. In doing so, one obtains the reduced — also called physical — phase space whose elementary variables are called observables because there are gauge invariant quantities and do not include gauge degrees of freedom any longer. Then one quantizes the physical phase space, which corresponds to the task of ﬁnding suitable representations of the algebra of  observables leading directly to the physical Hilbert space Hphys. In addition one is  only interested in those representations which also allow to implement the dynamics of those observables in the quantum theory.  Now in practice one often does not exclusively follow Dirac or reduced quanti- zation but often combines both approaches. If for example the classical constraints are complicated to solve, Dirac quantization might be of advantage as long one is able to solve the corresponding quantum constraint equations. On the other hand, if one is able to reduce the constraints at the classical level, one quantizes only the physical phase space and has thus a direct access to the physical Hilbert space. Therefore one is interested in both approaches. The technical diﬃculty in the reduced quantization occurs when the resulting algebra of observables has a much more complicated structure than the corresponding kinematical one because it might be impossible to ﬁnd representations of the algebra and hence to formulate the quantum theory at all.  As far as the ADM-variables are concerned one has mainly followed the Dirac quantization procedure and used standard Schr¨odinger quantization techniques, known from other quantum ﬁeld theories, to construct the corresponding kinemat-   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 33  Quantum Geometry  33  ical Hilbert space Hkin for general relativity [6]. If we denote the diﬀeomorphism constraint by CDiﬀ and the Hamiltonian constraint by C then one needs to ﬁnd quan- tum states ψ qab  that satisfy ˆCDiﬀ ψ qab  = 0 and ˆCψ qab  = 0. The latter equation  involving the Hamiltonian constraint is also known as the Wheeler–DeWitt equa- tion. However, this quantization of general relativity has to be understood rather at  a formal level because not all details about the measure underlying Hkin have been  worked out. Also, using ADM-variables and the standard Schr¨odinger representa- tion it has up to now not been shown that the Hamiltonian constraint operator can  be implemented on Hkin as a well deﬁned operator. Exactly these diﬃculties have  been the starting point for reconsidering the canonical quantization of general rela- tivity from a diﬀerent angle. We will see in the next section that a diﬀerent choice of elementary variables, called connection or Ashtekar variables, to describe the canonical formulation of general relativity will allow to formulate the kinematical  Hilbert space Hkin for general relativity not only at the formal level but will allow to implement all constraints of general relativity as operators on Hkin.  2. General Relativity in Connection Variables  The motivation for deriving a formulation of general relativity in terms of connection variables is that it allows to describe general relativity in a language very close to the language that is used in other quantum ﬁeld theories for which already powerful quantization techniques exist.  The starting point for the connection formulation is to describe general relativity in terms of frames. A frame ﬁeld denoted by eI := eμ I ∂μ with I = 0, 1, 2, 3 deﬁnes a basis of the tangent space TpM at each point p of M. Here we will discuss the  connection formulation by starting already with the ADM 3+1-split of the space- time and therefore work with frame ﬁelds, which are at a point dependent basis for the tangent space TpM associated with the 3-dimensional manifold M . Usually one works with orthonormal frames, meaning that ej := ea  j ∂a with j = 1, 2, 3 satisfy   cid:8 ej, ek cid:9  = ea j eb  kqab = ηij,  where ηjk denotes the components of the Euclidean metric on R3 and ea j is called triad or 3-bein respectively. Given a frame ﬁeld, we can deﬁne the  inverse  3-metric in terms of the triads   1    2   qab = ea  j eb  kηjk.  Conversely, qab deﬁnes a triad, however only up to SO 3 -rotations. Likewise to a adxa being a point dependent frame we can also introduce a co-frame ﬁeld ej := ej j and ej basis for the co-tangent space T a as non-singular matrices. Using the isomorphism between the Lie-algebras of su 2  and so 3  we can regard ej a as an su 2 -valued one-form. When we take this point of view we have to replace ηij by the Killing metric of su 2 , which we will also  ∗ p M . At each point in M we can view ea   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 34  34  K. Giesel  denote by ηij. Since the co-frame is at each point the dual basis of the frame we have  ηj k = ej ek  = ej  aeb  kdxa ∂b  = ej  aeb  kδa  b = ej  aea k.  Furthermore, we have  δa b = qacqcb = ea  j ec  kηjkem  c eb  nδmn = ea  j eb  nηjkδm  k δmn = ea  j ej b.  Due to the additional SO 3  freedom encoded in the triads the passage from the ADM-phase space to the frame formulation is not a canonical transformation but an extension of the ADM phase space. The elementary variable we will work with is not the triad itself but its densitized version, which is an su 2 -valued vector density of weight one, denoted by Ea  j and deﬁned as   cid:2   −1   det q ea j ,  Ea j := −1 = det e    5  −2 is understood as a function of the triads. where det q  = det q The densitized triads will be the momentum variables in the new phase space. As mentioned before in the ADM phase space the canonically conjugate momenta to qab are related to the extrinsic curvature, which we will denote by Kab. The canonically conjugate conﬁguration variable to the densitized triad is given by  which is, like ej  a, a su 2 -valued one-form.  For the reason that we have extended the ADM phase space by additional ro- tational degrees of freedom encoded in the  co -frames we obtain the so called rotational constraints given by  K j  a := Kabeb  kηjk,  Gj =  cid:4 jk cid:5 K k  a Ea  cid:5  ,  which ensure, that on shell we obtain again the ADM phase space. Given the canonical pair  K j j   we obtain the Ashtekar variables by applying two canonical transformations. The ﬁrst one is a rescaling of the elementary variables, which introduces the so called Barbero–Immirzi parameter γ  cid:10 = 0 ∈ C into the classical theory  a, Ea  →  γ K j  K j a  a := γKj a  →  γ Ea  j :=  Ea j  1 γ  Ea j .  The second canonical transformation involves the spin connection, which we brieﬂy discuss before describing the canonical transformation. Given the metric qab on M there exists a unique Levi-Civita connection ∇, also called covariant derivative, which is metric compatible, that is ∇qab = 0 and torsion-free, that is Γa bc = Γa cb, where Γa bc are the Christoﬀel symbols associated with qab. Once we introduce triads we have to consider tensors having spatial as well as su 2  indices and therefore we extend the covariant derivative onto tensors with mixed indices by deﬁning  ∇atb  j := ∂atb  j + Γb  actc  j + Γ k  a jtb k,   3    4    6    7    8    9    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 35  Quantum Geometry  35  with Γajk = −Γakj so that Γa is an antisymmetric matrix and takes values in so 3 . the requirements that ∇a commutes with contractions. compatibility ∇aqbc = 0 to ∇aeb  cid:4  j = 0 we can express Γ k and the Christoﬀel-symbols Γa  The extension to arbitrary tensors is obtained by linearity, the Leibniz rule and If we extend the metric a j in terms of the  co -triads   cid:3   bc given by a k = −eb Γ j  k  − Γc  abej c  ∂aej b  .  aTj with Γj  Since Γa takes values in so 3 , we can use a basis of so 3  denoted by {T1, T2, T3} with  Ti jk =  cid:4 ikj to expand Γa as Γj a being the spin connection. Note that we can also consider Ti as the generators of su 2  in the adjoint representation since there exists an isomorphism between su 2  in the adjoint and so 3  in the deﬁning representation. Using the spin connection we can now perform the second canonical transformation, which is an aﬃne transformation, and ﬁnally leads to the connection or Ashtekar variables →  γ Aj   10   →  γ Ea j .  a +  γ K j a  a := Γj   γ K j a   γ Ea j  Although Γj that   γ Aj algebra  a has, as a function of Ea  j , a complicated form it was proven [7, 8], j   build indeed a canonical pair and satisfy the following Poisson  a,  γ Ea  { γ Aj { γ Aj  a x ,  γ Ak a x ,  γ Eb  b  y } = { γ Ea k y } = kδj kδb  j  x ,  γ Eb aδ3 x, y ,  k y } = 0  where k = 8πGN with GN being Newton’s constant. In order to absorb the factor k occurring above in the deﬁnition of the elementary variables we use   11    12    13    γ P a  j :=   γ Eb  k y   1 k  as the canonically conjugate momenta to  γ Aj  a x  in the following.  Let us brieﬂy comment on the role of the Barbero–Immirzi-parameter. For each choice of γ we obtain a diﬀerent set of canonical variables to coordinatize the phase space of general relativity. At this point the choice is arbitrary but might be deter- mined from other physical situations like for instance the computation of the black hole entropy  see Chapter 7  . In the literature diﬀerent choices of γ have been discussed, as for example γ = ±i [7] and γ ∈ R [9] and γ ∈ C [10]. The choice γ = ±i is special in the sense that  i  The Hamiltonian constraint — and consequently its later quantization — sim- pliﬁes, and  ii  on classical solutions  γ Aj to M of the self-dual part of the space-time Lorentz connection. However, in this case the connection  γ Aj a is complex  in the Lorentzian signature  leading to an additional reality condition for  γ Aj a whose implementation on the quantum level is highly non-trivial. Therefore currently, one mainly works with real γ and real connection variables. From now on we will drop the label  γ  and just use  a has the natural geometric meaning of the restriction   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 36  36  K. Giesel  a, P a   Aj j   in order to keep our notation more clearly and always keep in mind that the construction of the Ashtekar variables involves the Barbero–Immirzi parameter. As mentioned in the last section the introduction of the Ashtekar variables allows to describe general relativity very close to the language of other gauge theories used in quantum ﬁeld theory and this point will become clear when we discuss the form of the constraints in terms of Ashtekar variables. We saw that with the extension of the ADM phase space we obtained the rotational constraint in  7 . Expressed in terms of  Aj  j   it has the form  a, P a   cid:5  =: DaP a j ,   cid:5   jk Ak  aP a  Gj = ∂aEa  j +  cid:4    14  where we introduced a new covariant derivative D, that involves instead of the spin connection the SU 2  connection Aj In terms of these new variables the a. rotational constraints have the form of an SU 2  Gauss law known from Yang–Mills gauge theory. Hence, in terms of the connection variables general relativity can be understood as a SU 2  gauge theory. The remaining constraint, that were already present in the ADM-formalism, are the  spatial  diﬀeomorphism constraints Ca and the Hamiltonian constraint C. Using the connection variables and considering the Gj = 0 constraint hypersurface, these are given by  Ca = F j  abP b  j  C =  kγ2 2  mP b P a n det q   −  1 + γ2  cid:4 jk cid:5 K k  a K m b  ,  F j ab   15   where we dropped the term proportional to the Gauss constraint in Ca and F j the curvature associated with the connection Aj a  ab is   cid:3    cid:2    cid:4  mn j  F j ab = ∂aAj  b  a +  cid:4 j  k cid:5 Ak  aA cid:5  b   16   a = Aj a  and K j P . Let us introduce the smeared version of the above constraints  a is considered as a function of  A, P   and det q  as a function of  CG Λ  :=  d3x ΛjGj  x ,  CDiﬀ    cid:2 N   :=  d3x N aCa  x  C N   :=  d3x NC  x .   cid:4    cid:5   M  − ∂bAj  cid:5   M  − Γj   cid:5   M   17  Here Λj is lie-algebra-valued smearing ﬁeld and N and N a are the lapse function and the shift vector respectively, which in the ADM-formalism are related to the 00 and 0a components of the  inverse  metric gμν by  g00 = N  −2,  g0a = N  −2N a.  An aspect that will be later important when the quantization of the  smeared  constraints is discussed is that they satisfy the following constraint algebra  {CG Λ ,CG Λ } = CG Λ ,  } = CDiﬀ  L  cid:7 N  } = −CDiﬀ   cid:2 S , Sa :=  {CDiﬀ    cid:2 N  ,CDiﬀ    cid:2 N {C N  ,C N   cid:3    cid:3   {CG Λ ,CDiﬀ    cid:2 N  } = −CG L  cid:7 N Λ ,  cid:3   cid:2 N   ,  {CG Λ ,C N  } = 0  cid:3  ,b  j P b k ηjk P a  det q   N N  − N   cid:3    cid:6    cid:7   N cid:2 b  .   21    18    19    20    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 37  Quantum Geometry  37  The subalgebra of C N   and CDiﬀ    cid:2 N   encodes the diﬀeomorphism invariance at the  canonical level and can be also derived from purely geometrical considerations [11]; see also the discussion in Chapter 2. It will play a pivotal role in the quantization of the constraint operators because one requires that the corresponding constraint operators satisfy an analogue commutator algebra in order to carry over the classical symmetries into the quantum theory.  Let us ﬁnally summarize: We have formulated general relativity in terms of connection variables  A, P  . The corresponding action in the 3+1-picture is given by   cid:5    cid:5   R  M   cid:3   − cid:6   S =  dt  d3x  ˙Aj  aP j a  ΛjGj + NC + N aCa  .   cid:7  cid:4   The ‘Hamiltonian’ H is given by  H = CG Λ  + C N   + CDiﬀ    cid:2 N    and, as mentioned before, is a linear combination of constraints only. The Hamil- tonian equation of motion  a x  = {Aj ˙Aj  a x , H},  j  x  = {P a ˙P a  j  x , H}  together with the constraints  CG Λ  = 0,  C N   = 0,  CDiﬀ    cid:2 N   = 0  are completely equivalent to Einstein’s equations in vacuum  Rμν − 1  2  gμνR = 0.  For the reason that the ‘Hamiltonian’ H vanishes on the constraint hypersurface, the evolution generated by H is interpreted as gauge transformations and not as a physical evolution. A discussion on how physical evolution can be implemented in the context of general relativity in the framework of observables can for instance be found in Ref. [12].  2  2  D D+1   D+1 dimensions a spatial metric has D D+1  dimensions includes D2 degrees of freedom. Consequently, we need D2 − D D−1   We have discussed the connection formulation for space-times of dimension 4. In degrees of freedom, while a frame in D = constraints in order to recover the corresponding ADM formulation in D +1 dimensions. Note that D D+1  is precisely the dimension of SO D  and thus it would be a natural choice for a gauge group here. However, an SO D  connection has D2 D−1  degrees of freedom and the only dimension for D in which the number of degrees of freedom of the D-bein and the SO D  connection coincide is the special case D = 3.  2  2  2  However, this does not mean, that there exists no connection variable formu- lation in higher dimensions. Recently, it has been shown that one can introduce a diﬀerent extension of the ADM phase space and formulate general relativity in   22    23    24    25    26    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 38  38  K. Giesel  terms of SO D+1  Yang Mills variables [13]. In order to match the degrees of free- dom of the ADM phase space and thus general relativity, the formulation in Ref. [13] includes additional constraints, that have to be implemented.  Although we have restricted our discussion to the vacuum case here, the connec- tion formulation can be generalized to gravity coupled to matter by simply perform- ing a 3+1-split also for the matter action [14]  see also Ref. [15] for a pedagogical introduction to this topic . We then obtain further degrees of freedom in phase space describing the matter part of the theory. The constraints and hence also the ‘Hamiltonian’ will then include additional contributions from the matter degrees of freedom. In the next section we will also restrict the discussion for simplicity to the vacuum case and show how a quantum theory for the connection formulation can be constructed.  3. Holonomy-Flux Algebra and its Representation s   The connection formulation of general relativity discussed in the last section is the classical starting point for loop quantum gravity. Before we explain in detail how this works for the connection formulation of general relativity let us brieﬂy recall how canonical quantization is used in quantum mechanics.  3.1. Canonical Quantization in Quantum Mechanics  In quantum mechanics we choose as the classical starting point the phase space coordinatized by  qj, pj , that satisfy the so called Heisenberg algebra  {qj, qk} = 0  {pj, pk} = 0  {qj, pk} = δj k.  -algebraa U of operators To formulate the quantum theory, we introduce an abstract generated by ˆq, ˆp and  cid:0 A. Since we want to replace Poisson brackets by commutators in the quantum theory we set  ∗  [ˆqj, ˆpk] =: i cid:2   cid:3 {qj, pk}  ∗   ˆqj   = qj  ∗   ˆpj   = pj,   27    28   ∗  where the bar denotes complex conjugation. The task is now to ﬁnd a representation -algebra, that is a map π : A → L H  from the algebra into of this abstract the subalgebra of linear operators on a Hilbert space H, which has the following properties   cid:3  π cˆa + c   cid:3  ˆa   cid:3    = cπ ˆa  + c   cid:3    cid:3   π ˆa    π ˆaˆa    = π ˆa π ˆa    = π ˆa   ,   29    cid:3   ∗   π a  †  where a is an element of the algebra generated by {qj, pj,  cid:0 A},  †  denotes the adjoint  operation and π furthermore has to satisfy  [π ˆqj , π ˆpk ] = i cid:2 π  cid:0 A  = i cid:2  cid:0 H.  ∗  -algebra is an algebra with an involution, that is a map ∗ : A → A where a  cid:4 → a∗  ∗     = za∗  + z cid:3 a cid:3 ∗  ,  aa cid:3      ∗  = a cid:3 ∗a∗  and  a∗     ∗  has the = a for all a, a cid:3  ∈ U, c,  aA following properties  ca + c cid:3 a cid:3  c cid:3  ∈ R.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 39  Quantum Geometry  39  In the case of quantum mechanics  QM  the representation is well known and called  the Schr¨odinger representation. The Hilbert space H is H = L2 R3, d3x  and the  explicit form of the representation is   π ˆqj ψ  x  = xjψ x    π ˆpj ψ  x  = −i cid:2   ∂ψ ∂xj  x .   30   Hence, the conﬁguration variables become multiplication and the momenta deriva- tion operators. We realize that formulating the classical theory requires two main choices for any quantum theory. The ﬁrst choice is the classical Poisson algebra, that we take as a starting point for the quantization. Diﬀerent choices will in general lead to diﬀerent algebras and therefore ﬁnally also to diﬀerent quantum theories. Secondly, even if we restrict our discussion to one particular choice of the classi- cal Poisson algebra, in general there exists more than one possible representation of this algebra. Any of those representations can in principle deﬁne a diﬀerent quantum theory, unless they are unitary equivalent. We call two representations  −1 = π2 ˆa  for all ˆa ∈ A.  π1 and π2 unitary equivalent if there exists an unitary operator U : H1 → H2 such that U π1 ˆa U In the context of QM the famous Stone-von-Neumann uniqueness theorem states that under very mild assumptions on the representation the Schr¨odinger representation is up to unitary equivalence the unique representation for QM. This theorem was announced by Stone in 1930 and the ﬁrst complete proof was given by von Neumann [17]. The actual proof uses the Weyl — instead of the Heisenberg — algebra, whose generators are the exponentiated versions of the qj’s and pj’s discussed above. However, since one of the assumptions for the representation is that it should be weakly continuous, the operators ˆqj and ˆpj also exist in this representation and one can also recover the Heisenberg commutation relations coming from the Weyl algebra. So far we have only considered kinematical requirements for the choice of the representation. Of course the dynamics plays as an important role as it does in the classical theory. Therefore, we are only interested in those representations that allow to implement the generators of the classical dynamics as operators. In the case of standard QM, this is the Hamiltonian, which usually is a simple function on the phase space. Hence, in the Schr¨odinger representation the corresponding operators can be imple- mented. In the case of general relativity using Dirac quantization we have to ﬁnd representations for which the classical constraints can be quantized on the kinemat- ical Hilbert space. We will see in the following discussion, that this requirement forces us to introduce a diﬀerent representation than the usual Fock representation used in perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory in Minkowski space-time.  3.2. The Holonomy–Flux–Algebra A  Now we take the connection formulation of general relativity as our classical starting point for the quantization. The diﬀerence with classical mechanics is that general relativity is a ﬁeld theory and hence the variables  Aj j  x   are too singular to be directly promoted to operators. Therefore one quantizes not  Aj j  x    a x , P a  a x , P a   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 40  40  K. Giesel  themselves but particular smeared versions of these elementary variables. In the case of standard canonical quantum ﬁeld theory, one uses a 3-dimensional smearing over M for the basic ﬁeld variables and their conjugate momenta. However, this kind of smearing is deﬁned with respect to a particular background metric. For general relativity we will choose a diﬀerent way of smearing  Aj j  x  , which in particular has the property to be independent of any background metric and leads to basic variables similar to those used in ordinary lattice gauge theory. The SU 2 -connection Aj a is an su 2 -valued one-form and thus it is natural to integrate the connection along oriented curves e : [0, 1] → M, s  cid:12 → e s  in M , which we call edges. If we further take the path-ordered exponential of this integral, we obtain the holonomy associated with the connection A given by  a x , P a   31    cid:5  A e  := P exp  ∞ cid:8   e  A   1 cid:5   1 cid:5   1 cid:5   n=0  0  s1  sn−1  =  cid:0 2 +  ds1  ds2 ···  dsnA e s1  A e s2  ··· A e sn  ,   32   a e si  τjea si  and τj denotes a basis of su 2 . Let us consider where A e si   := Aj an edge e : [0, 1] → M, s  cid:12 → e s  in M with beginning point b e  = e 0  and ﬁnal point f  e  = e 1  and let t ∈ [0, 1]. Then the holonomy A e  = A e, 1  is the unique solution of the following diﬀerential equation  d dt  A e, t  = A e, t Aj  a e t  τj ˙ea t  with A e, 0  =  cid:0 2   33   which describes the parallel transport from b e  to f  e  along the edge e. In our case the holonomy is an element of the group SU 2 . Under the composition of two  edges e1 ◦ e2, for which the ﬁnal and beginning point are the same and under the  inversion of edges e  −1, the holonomy behaves as A e1 ◦ e2  = A e1 A e2   −1  = A  −1 e .  A e   34   Note that e  −1 is obtained from e by reversing the orientation of the edge.  Similar variables are also used in ordinary lattice gauge theory with the cor- responding connections of the gauge theories of the standard model. The reason for this is that the holonomies transform very simply under gauge transforma- −1 under SU 2  gauge tions. While the connection transforms as Ag = gAg −1 = transformation, the transformed holonomy is Ag e  = g e 0  A e g e 1   −1. Hence, the transformation acts only at the beginning and g b e  A e g f  e   ﬁnal points of the curve and this simple behavior is of advantage when later gauge invariant quantities in the quantum theory will be constructed. For instance, the famous Wilson-loop deﬁned as T r P exp  A   is the holonomy of a given con-  −1 − dgg   cid:9   nection A along a closed loop β and one example of a gauge invariant observable because the trace allows to cyclic permute the matrices and b e  = f  e  for a loop −1g b e   =  cid:0 G can be used, where  cid:0 G denotes the unit element so that g f  e    β   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 41  Quantum Geometry  41  in the gauge group G. Considering the conjugate variable P a j also here exists — from the geometric perspective — a natural smearing. The densitized triad P a j is a su 2 -valued vector density of weight +1. Introducing a su 2 -valued smearing ﬁeld f j, P a f   := f jP a j is vector density and hence dual to a  pseudo-  2-form in three dimensions, using that  cid:4 abc carries density weight -1. Given this  pseudo-  2-form the natural smearing is over two-dimensional surfaces, thus we deﬁne the conjugate variables, the so called  electric  ﬂuxesb as f j ∗P  j =  j dxb ∧ dxc.  f j cid:4 abcP a  P  S, f   =   cid:5    cid:5    35   S  S  If one computes the Poisson bracket between the holonomies and ﬂuxes the result depends on the position of the edge e relative to the surface S. In order to discuss this in detail we introduce the notion of an elementary edge. We have to consider 4 diﬀerent cases for the elementary edges. If S ∩ e = 0 we call e an edge of type out. If S ∩ e = e and hence e lies entirely inside S we call e of type in. If e is not of type in but S ∩ e  cid:10 = 0 we consider as elementary edges only those, which have one intersection point, denoted by p, with S in its end points. If e lies above S, we call e of type up and if e lies below S of type down. Furthermore, we distinguish the cases where p is the beginning point b e  and the ﬁnal point f  e  respectively. Any edge e can be written as a composition of elementary edges by introducing appropriate additional vertices. Using this classiﬁcation we have  {A e , P  S, f  } = − κ S, e   ×  2  A e τjf j b e   −τjf j f  e  A e   if S ∩ e = b e  if S ∩ e = f  e ,  with   36    37   if e of type up  κ S, e  =  if e of type in or out  if e of type down.   cid:10   ⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩+1  0 −1  As discussed in the context of QM, we have to ﬁnd a suitable Poisson algebra, which encodes the underlying classical theory. In the case of QM this was the Heisenberg- and Weyl-algebra respectively. In both cases the Hilbert space associated with the representation is an L2 R3, d3x -space, that is the space of square integrable func- tion over R3 with the standard Lebesgue measure d3x on R3. Hence, we see for QM the Hilbert space underlying the representation involves the construction of a measure on R3, which is the classical conﬁguration space for classical mechan- ics. For general relativity we consider a classical ﬁeld theory and in terms of the connection formulation the classical conﬁguration space A is the space of smooth connections. As usual in canonical ﬁeld theories, the quantum theory is not based on the classical conﬁguration space, but requires the introduction of a larger space,  bThe name  electric  ﬂux comes from analogy to electrodynamics where in the Hamiltonian frame- work the canonical momentum is precisely the electric ﬁeld and integrating it over a surface gives the electric ﬂux.

Thus, for loop quantum gravity, we have to construct a measure on the quantum conﬁguration space. For this reason we will choose our classical Poisson algebra in such a way that it can be easily extended from the classical conﬁguration space A to the quantum conﬁguration space A. For this purpose, we introduce so called cylin- drical functions on A. So far we have restricted our discussion to an arbitrary but single edge e. Now we generalize this picture and introduce the notion of a graph α. A graph α consists of a ﬁnite collection of edges {e1,··· , en} in M , whereas the  edges intersect only in their beginning or ﬁnal points. These intersection points are called vertices of α. For a given graph α, we denote the set of edges by E α  and the set of vertices by V  α . In order to give the deﬁnition of a cylindrical function,  we denote the subset of connections associated with a graph α by Aα ⊂ A. Aα contains all connections Aei associated with the edges {ei} of the graph α. Then  there exists a map  IE : Aα → SU  2 n with A ∈ Aα  cid:12 → IE A  :=  A e1 ,··· , A en     38   and we can use this IE to deﬁne smooth cylindrical functionsc deﬁned with respect to a given graph α with edges {e1,··· , en} as  fα A  = Fα IE A   = Fα A e1 ,··· , A en  ,   39  where Fα : SU  2 n → C is a C ∞−function on n copies of SU 2 . A function f on A is said to be cylindrical if it can be written in the above form for some graph α. Since each fα depends only on a ﬁnite number of holonomies, we need to consider all possible graphs α, that can be embedded into M in order to describe the Poisson is said to be larger algebra underlying gravity in connection variables. A graph α than a given graph α, if every edge e can be written as a ﬁnite combination of for some set of edges {e  i = 1,··· ,  cid:9 }  cid:3  i of α edges e  cid:15  where s = ±1. Note that every function f on A, which is cylindrical with of α respect to a given graph α will automatically be cylindrical with respect to any Cylα. Given larger graph α  cid:3  ∈ Cylα cid:2  . We say that  such that f ∈ Cylα and f  .

We deﬁne the space of smooth cylindrical functions on A as  , provided that f, f  agree for all larger   cid:3   Cylα  ∼ .  Cyl :=  α   40   ∗  Thus, Cyl consists of equivalence classes of functions on the spaces Cylα. Cyl can be shown to be an Abelian C -algebra deﬁned by point wise operations and with the supremum-norm. In order to choose the Poisson algebra underlying loop quantum gravity, we still have to discuss the conjugate momentum variables associated with the smooth cylindrical functions on A. The latter will be the ﬂux vector ﬁelds on cHere a cylindrical function f is said to be smooth if any of its representatives fα on Gn is smooth.

Finally, we can now deﬁne the classical Poisson algebra, which will be the starting point for our quantization in the next section, and which is called the holonomy–ﬂux algebra A:  ∗    The classical Poisson algebra underlying loop quantum gravity is the Lie -subalgebra of Cyl×V  Cyl  generated by the smooth cylindrical functions and ﬂux vector ﬁelds on Cyl. The involution on the algebra is just complex conjugation. This algebra is called the holonomy–ﬂux algebra and will be denoted by A.  We will discuss the representation of the holonomy–ﬂux algebra in the next section.  4. The Ashtekar-Lewandowski Representation and the Kinematical  Hilbert Space of LQG  So far we have discussed smooth cylindrical functions on the classical conﬁguration space A. For the derivation of the kinematical Hilbert space underlying the rep- resentation of the holonomy–ﬂux algebra, we have to construct a measure on the quantum conﬁguration space A. The necessity of A can be also understood from the following perspective: In order to obtain a kinematical Hilbert space H from Cyl, we need to take the Cauchy-completion with respect to a norm deﬁned on Cyl. This completion will include objects as limit points, which cannot be understood as functions on A, but are more general objects such as distributions on A. The strategy one adopts is to look for a larger quantum conﬁguration space A such that H is isomorphic to an L2-space over A with respect to some measure on A. As we will see below the action of the ﬂux vector ﬁelds on Cyl can be easily extended from cylindrical functions on A to cylindrical functions on A by the introduction of left- and right-invariant vector ﬁelds on SU 2 . A measure on A can be deﬁned by using the fact that any cylindrical function over a graph α can be expressed via the map IE in  38  by means of functions F on SU 2 n. On SU  2 n a natural measure exists, using n copies of the Haar measure on SU 2 . This allows to ﬁrstly deﬁne a measure on Aα, which includes all, not necessarily smooth connections {Aei } along the edges of the graph α, and thus an inner product on Cylα for all α given by  cid:8 fα, ˜fα cid:9  :=  dμH A ei  Fα A e1 ,··· , A en  Fα A e1 ,··· , A en  ,  42   n cid:17    cid:5   SU 2 n  i=1   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 44  44  K. Giesel   cid:3  cid:3   where dμH  g  denotes the Haar measure on SU 2 . Taking the closure of Cylα with respect to the corresponding norm of the above deﬁned inner product, we obtain Hilbert spaces Hα := L2 Aα, dμα  for all graphs α. The kinematical Hilbert space H can then be constructed using projective techniques, because A can be understood as the projective limit of the Aα’s. Given the measures μα on Aα, they can be used to construct a measure denoted by μAL, called the Ashtekar–Lewandowski measure, on A. For this purpose, we have to discuss how an inner product can be deﬁned  cid:3  in case the functions fα cid:2  , ˜fα cid:2  cid:2  are cylindrical with respect to two diﬀerent graphs α respectively. Given this situation, we can use that Cyl has the property, and α  cid:3  with respect to which f, ˜f are that we can always ﬁnd a common graph α > α cylindrical. Hence, we can use α to deﬁne an inner product for fα cid:2  , ˜fα cid:2  cid:2 . Here we associate trivial holonomies to fα cid:2  and fα cid:2  cid:2  respectively to those edges in α, which are not contained in α respectively. Cylindrical consistency ensures that the inner product on A does not depend on the particular choice of the common  cid:3  ∪ α  cid:3  cid:3  graph α. For instance, if we take as the common graph just the union α := α , then the inner product deﬁned with respect to α should yield the same value as if . Also, the we further unify the graph α with another graph α inner product should be the same for two graphs α and ˜α when ˜α can be obtained from α just by subdividing edges of α by means of the introduction of additional vertices. Thus, we deﬁne the inner product on A for f, ˜f ∈ Cyl as  cid:8 fα, ˜fα cid:9  :=  dμH A ei  Fα A e1 ,··· , A en  Fα A e1 ,··· , A en  ,  43    cid:3  not contained in α  n cid:17   and α   cid:5   , α   cid:3  cid:3  cid:3    cid:3  cid:3    cid:3  cid:3    cid:3   SU 2 n  i=1  where α is a common graph with respect to which f and ˜f are cylindrical. Consider- ing the closure of Cyl with respect to the corresponding norm gives the kinematical Hilbert space H = L2 A, dμAL , which is the space of square integrable functions over A with respect to the Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure. Now, given the kine- matical Hilbert space H we can discuss the representation π of the holonomy–ﬂux algebra. The space Cyl is dense in H and therefore we can deﬁne the action of the elementary operators in the Ashtekar–Lewandowski representation on Cyl. The holonomy operators act as multiplication operators and hence we obtain for cylin- drical functions   44  for ψ ∈ H. The ﬂux vector ﬁelds become derivation operators and their explicit action is given by   π f  ψ  A  =   ˆf ψ  A  = f  A ψ A    π P  S, f   ψ  A  = ˆP  S, f  ψ A  =  X S, f  ψ  A    45  for ψ ∈ H, that lie in the domain of ˆP  S, f  . We will express the right-hand side of the equation above now by means of the left- and right-invariant vector ﬁelds on SU 2  denoted by Lj and Rj respectively. Given a function f : SU  2  → C and  cid:6  g ∈SU 2  these are deﬁned as   cid:6    cid:7    cid:7    Rjf   g  :=  f  etτj g   t=0   Ljf   g  :=  f  getτj    t=0 .   46   d dt  d dt   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 45  Thus, we can deﬁne the action of the ﬂux operators on fα in Cylα as  ˆP  S, f  fα A  =  f j v   κ e, S  ˆY  v,e   j  fα A ,  Quantum Geometry   cid:8   e∈E α  e∩v cid:7 =∅   cid:8   v∈V  α    cid:2   2   cid:18   iRe j−iLe  j   cid:19   45   47    cid:19    cid:18   with  ˆY  v,e  j  :=  cid:0 H ×  cid:0 H ×···×  cid:0 H×  ×  cid:0 H ×···×  cid:0 H,  if  e outgoing at v e ingoing at v   48  This ﬁnishes our discussion on the kinematical representation of loop quantum gravity. The next subsection will brieﬂy deal with the question whether there exists other than the already introduced representation for the kinematical Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity.  4.1. Other Representations of the Holonomy–ﬂux-algebra U  In the last section we discussed in detail how the kinematical representation for loop quantum gravity looks like. As we have seen the algebra underlying loop quantum gravity is the holonomy–ﬂux algebra U and one possible representation of this al- gebra is the Ashtekar–Lewandowski representation  AL-representation  introduced above. In the context of quantum mechanics we already brieﬂy mentioned that given a choice of a classical algebra in general more than one possible represen- tation of the algebra exists and thus in general diﬀerent quantum theories can be obtained from the same classical starting point. This is a particularly interesting aspect in the case of general relativity since it is a ﬁeld theory and in contrast to quantum mechanics an analog to Stone–von Neumann theorem does not exist. As a consequence, in the context of ﬁeld theories, in principle, inﬁnitely many unitarily non-equivalent representations could exist. However, in practice ﬁnding represen- tations of a given algebra can be a challenging task and often we are happy to have found one at all. Nevertheless it is an interesting question to ask what kind of as- sumptions in the AL-representation have to be required in order to make it, under those assumptions, the — up to unitary equivalence — unique representation of the holonomy–ﬂux algebra.  An answer to this question is given by the so called LOST-theorem [18, 19] and yields progress in two directions. On the one hand, we learn what kind of characteristic properties the AL-representations has and on the other hand, we can try to look for new representations by violating one of those assumptions. What are the assumptions needed in the LOST-theorem? As required in most physical theories one of the assumptions is that the representation should be irreducible. This means that any vector in H is a cyclic vector. A cyclic vector Ω is a vector in H for which the set {π a Ω a ∈ A} is dense in H. Further assumptions are related to the  gauge  symmetries of general relativity formulated in connection variables. As usual for quantum theories one requires that the classical symmetries should be implemented by unitary operators. In the context of the holonomy–ﬂux   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 46  46  K. Giesel  algebra U the LOST-theorem includes an assumption on a positive linear functional on the holonomy–ﬂux algebra so that this is automatically fulﬁlled for the spatial diﬀeomorphisms and the SU 2 -gauge transformations. The positive linear func- tional is used in the context of the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal theorem to construct a cyclic representation of U. Moreover, the LOST-theorem assumes that there is at least one vector Ω ∈ H that is invariant under diﬀeomorphisms. These assump- tions are strong enough to restrict the number of possible representations of the holonomy-ﬂux algebra, up to unitarily equivalence, to one single representation, the AL-representation, which is summarized in the theorem below [18, 19]  Theorem 1. There is only one cyclic representation of the holonomy–ﬂux alge- bra A with diﬀeomorphism invariant cyclic vector — the Ashtekar–Lewandowski representation.  Characteristic properties of the AL-representation are:    As we will see in Section 6 so called geometric operators associated with length, volume and area have purely discrete spectra, giving already an idea that quantum geometry could yield to a new fundamental picture of geometry.   Although operators for the holonomy A e  exist, there are no operators   Similarly, also for the spatial diﬀeomorphisms the inﬁnitesimal generators do not exist, but only ﬁnite diﬀeomorphisms are implemented as unitary operators.  a directly in this representation.  representing the connection Aj  A diﬀerent representation, that is not unitary equivalent to the AL-representation was rather recently discussed in the literature and is the so called Koslowski– Sahlmann [20–22] representation  KS-representation . The way the LOST-theorem is circumvented is that in the KS-representation the spatial diﬀeomorphism is not implemented unitarily, as will be discussed more in detail below. In the context of the above mentioned GNS theorem, associated with the AL-representation is a so called GNS vacuum state, which in the case of AL-representation describes an extremely degenerate situation of an empty geometry. Here the smooth classical spatial geometry is expected to arise through some coarse-graining procedure that describes the transition from the deep quantum to the classical regime. There- fore an interesting question is whether the observed smoothness of classical geom- etry can already be described at the quantum level without applying any coarse- graining. Following this idea Koslowski [20] considered a slight modiﬁcation of the AL-representation, in which he extended the representation of the ﬂux operators. In particular, the representation of the ﬂuxes is changed by adding a c-number term  πP  0  P  S, f    = ˆP  S, f   + P  0  S, f  1H  with  P  0  S, f   :=   cid:5   S  f j ∗P  0  j,   49    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 47  Quantum Geometry  47  where P  0  S, f   is the classical value of the ﬂux with respect to a background geometry given by the densitized triad E 0  = kP  0 . For this reason we labeled the representation πP  0  by P  0  in order to distinguish between the AL- und KS- representation. The Hilbert space associated with πP  0  is the same as in the AL-representation, that is H P  0  = H and the action of the holonomies and the cylindrical function respectively agrees, thus  πP  0   f   = π f   = ˆf .   50   Note that in the case P  0  = 0 we recover the AL-representation. In this sense the representations πP  0  can be understood as a family of representations, with one member being the AL-representation. However, for other choices than P  0  = 0 the AL- and the KS-representation are not unitarily equivalent and therefore could in principle describe diﬀerent physics. We have already mentioned above that spatial diﬀeomorphism are not implemented unitarily in the KS-representation, being however one of the assumptions in the LOST-theorem. By this we mean, that if ˆU  φ  denotes the unitary operator implementing spatial diﬀeomorphisms φ in the AL-representation, then in general we have  ˆU  φ πP  0   P  S, f    ˆU  †   φ   cid:10 = πP  0   P  φ S , φ ∗  f   .   51   The reason that the above equality fails is that the quantity P  0  is ﬁxed and will not transform under the action of ˆU  φ . Since also in the context of the KS- representation spatial diﬀeomorphism play an important role, it was shown in Ref. [21] that by enlarging the Hilbert space H P  0  one can deﬁne unitary operators that implement spatial diﬀeomorphisms that also involve the background ﬁeld P  0  and hence implement the corresponding automorphisms of the SU 2  principle ﬁber bundle on which the whole mathematical formulation of the theory is based. In the context of the  enlarged  Hilbert space of the KS-representation, denoted by HKS, an orthonormal basis of the form {s, P  0  cid:9 } exists where s denotes a standard spin network in the AL-representation, which are discussed in detail in the next subsection and which provide an orthonormal basis for H, and P  0  denotes, as before, a background ﬁeld. The inner product in HKS is of the following form   cid:8 s  cid:3   , P   cid:3  0   s, P  0  cid:9  =  cid:8 s   cid:3   s cid:9 ALδP  cid:2  0 ,P  0 ,   52    cid:3   s cid:9 AL denotes the inner product in the AL-representation. The action of  where  cid:8 s the cylindrical functions and ﬂuxes in HKS is given by  ˆfs, E cid:9  =  ˆf s, E cid:9   ˆP  S, f  s, E cid:9  =  ˆP  S, f  s, E cid:9  + P  0  S, f  s, E cid:9 .   53   As shown in Refs. [21] and [23] the KS-representation based on this enlarged Hilbert space supports a unitary implementation of the spatial diﬀeomorphisms as well as the SU 2  gauge transformation  for which similar problems occur  and the diﬀeo- morphism and SU 2  gauge invariant Hilbert space can be constructed using the technique of group averaging that is discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 48  48  K. Giesel  In Ref. [24] it was pointed out that if one considers also higher order commuta- tors such as for instance the element of U given by  0, [ ˆP  S, f1 , [ ˆP  S, f2 , ˆP  S, f3  ]]  then one can derive the following identity for the double commutator  [ ˆP  S, f1 , [ ˆP  S, f2 , ˆP  S, f3  ]] =  ˆP  S, [f1, [f2, f3]]    54   1 4  and thus using the AL-representation of the holonomy–ﬂux algebra U the elements  0, [ ˆP  S, f1 , [ ˆP  S, f2 , ˆP  S, f3  ]]  and  0, 1 ˆP  S, [f1, [f2, f3]]  need to be identiﬁed. 4 Let us now consider the situation in the KS-representation. There we have  [πP  0   P  S, f1  , [πP  0   P  S, f2  , πP  0   P   S, f3  ]]   55   = [ ˆP  S, f1 , [ ˆP  S, f2 , ˆP  S, f3  ]],  where the equality above is true because the constant contributions of the back- ground ﬁelds P  0  cancel in the double commutator. As a consequence we obtain  [πP  0  P  S, f1  , [πP  0   P  S, f2  , πP  0  P   S, f3  ]] =  ˆP  S, [f1, [f2, f3]] .   56   1 4  However, due to the part coming from the background ﬁeld in πP  0   P  S, f    we have  πP  0   P  S, [f1, [f2, f3]]    cid:10 = ˆP  S, [f1, [f2, f3]] .   57   The suggestion in [24] to cure this problem is the modiﬁcation of commutation relations of the standard holonomy–ﬂux algebra by an appropriate central term. As also discussed in Ref. [24] it is still an open question whether the introduction of such a central term is suﬃcient in the context of further higher order commutators, that could yield additional relations among the algebra elements.  A diﬀerent point of view is taken in Ref. [25] where the holonomy–ﬂux algebra is extended by the so called background exponentials denoted by βP  0  A  whose explicit form is given by   cid:2   S  P  0 ·A  i βP  0   A  := e  with  P  0  · A :=  P  0  a  i Ai a.  Next to the holonomy and ﬂux action in HKS given above these background expo-  nentials act as  ˆβP  cid:2  0 s, P  0  cid:9  = s, P   cid:3  0  + P  0  cid:9 .   58    59   We have discussed in the last section that the AL-representation is a represen- tation of the holonomy–ﬂux algebra U. If we instead consider the holonomy– ﬂux algebra enlarged by these background exponentials, called the holonomy- background-exponential-ﬂux algebra in Ref. [25], then it was shown [25] that the KS-representation can be also understood as a representation of the holonomy- background-exponential-ﬂux algebra.

Spin Networks as an Orthonormal Basis of the Kinematical  Hilbert Space  A useful orthonormal basis of the kinematical Hilbert space H is given by so called spin network basis. Also here we will take advantage of an already existing natural orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space L2 SU  2 , dμH  . Let us consider the equiva- lence classes of ﬁnite dimensional, unitary, irreducible representations of SU 2  on a representation space Vj and take one representative of it denoted by πj. We denote the dimension of πj by dim πj . We deﬁne the following functions on SU 2  mn : SU 2  → C, bj  mn g , m, n = 1,··· , dim πj .  dim πj πj   cid:9  :=  mn  Using the Haar measure μH on SU 2 , we can deﬁne an inner product for bj   cid:2    cid:8 bj mn, bj  m cid:2 n cid:2  cid:9  :=  dμH g   2j + 1πj  mn g   2j cid:3  + 1πj   cid:2  m cid:2 n cid:2   g ,   60   mn as   61    cid:2   cid:2    cid:2   g  cid:12 →  cid:8 g  bj  cid:5   SU 2   where we used dim πj  = 2j + 1 in the case of SU 2 .

Hence, in our case G =SU 2  we have  functions {bj  mn   cid:8 bj mn, bj  δmm cid:2  δnn cid:2  .   cid:2    cid:2   m cid:2 n cid:2  cid:9  = δj,j  cid:20   Hj  j  The Hilbert space L2 SU  2 , dμH  decomposes into a direct sum over all inequiva- lent irreducible representations labeled by j  L2 SU  2 , dμH   =  with Hj := Vj ⊗ V  ∗ j ,  j denotes the dual space of Vj. A basis in Hj is given by {bj ∗   m, n ∈ where V −j,−j + 1,··· , j − 1, j}. Now, we will use this fact to construct the spin network basis of H = L2 A, dμAL . For this purpose we ﬁrst consider the Hilbert spaces Hα associated with a ﬁxed graph α, which can be identiﬁed with L2 SU 2 n, dnμH  . For this reason we can construct an orthonormal basis of Hα simply by introducing  mn  the so called spin network functions  SNF   s  cid:8 A s   cid:7 j α, cid:7 n,  cid:7 m  cid:7 j α, cid:7 n,  cid:7 m  2je1 + 1··· cid:2   cid:2    cid:9  : Aα → C, A  cid:12 →  cid:8 A s  cid:9  :=   cid:7 j α, cid:7 n,  cid:7 m   cid:9  me1 ne1  A e1  ··· πjen 2jen + 1πje1  men nen  A en  ,  with   cid:2 j := {je1,··· , jen  },  A decomposition in terms of irreducible representations of SU 2  associated with each edge of the graph α is given by  },   cid:2 m := {me1 ,··· , men  cid:20   α, cid:7 j with H H  }.   cid:2 n := {ne1 ,··· , nen n cid:21   Hjei ,  α, cid:7 j :=  i=1  Hα =   cid:7 j   62    63    64    65    66    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 50  50  K.

We choose a ﬁxed set of representations  cid:2 j and will discuss how H α, cid:7 j can be further decomposed, which will be of advantage when we discuss the solutions to the Gauss constraint later on. Let us choose an arbitrary vertex vi ∈ V  α  and consider all edges {ei} intersecting at vi. Let us assume that α has m = V  α  vertices. Then we can rewrite H Hjei .  Hvi :=   cid:21   m cid:21   H α, cid:7 j =  α, cid:7 j as  Hvi  with   67   i=1  e∈E α  ei∩vi cid:7 =∅  j  j   cid:5   k  , ˆY  vi,ei   ˆY  vi,ei   cid:5   ] = i cid:4  jk  cid:5   satisfy [ ˆY  vi,ei   The operators ˆY  vi,ei  , where we have cho- sen the basis {τj} in such a way that [τj, τk] =  cid:4  jk τ cid:5 . They can be interpreted as components of angular momentum operators. For diﬀerent edges ei  cid:10 = ej these op- erators commute. A natural basis in the context of angular momentum operators is the eigenbasis {jm cid:9 }, that is labelled by the angular momentum j and the magnetic quantum number m. Let us restrict our discussion to the case of one edge ﬁrst and denote the abstract angular momentum Hilbert space by Hjm and the associated spin network Hilbert space for this edge e by Hjm. Then the corresponding SNF  are   cid:8 A jeme cid:9 ne :=  2je + 1πje  mene  A e  .

In order to rewrite this in terms of standard angular momentum operators ˆJ  v,e  and their eigenbasis jm cid:9  we construct for ﬁxed n a unitary map W : Hjm → Hjm that satisﬁes W ˆJ  v,e   and is explicitly given by  −1 = ˆY  v,e   j  k  W : Hjm → Hjm jm; n cid:9   cid:12 → Wjeme; ne cid:9  =  me ˜me   cid:4  je cid:23 me cid:9 ne ,  πj   cid:2    cid:8   ˜me  with  cid:4  := iσ2 =  .

Hence, the spin network function s   cid:9  can be rewritten in the abstract angular momentum basis as   cid:7 j α,  cid:7 m, cid:7 n    cid:4    cid:8 As   cid:7 j α,  cid:7 m, cid:7 n   cid:9  = π  je1 me1 ˜me1   cid:9 ··· πjen   cid:9 . −1  cid:8 A je1 ˜me1 ; ne1  73   cid:9  with abstract angular momen- By means of the unitary map W we identify s tum states and the operators ˆY  v,e  and thus we can also discuss the further decomposition of H α, cid:7 j in the context of angular momentum coupling theory. Let introduce the following operator associated with the vertex vi  with angular momentum operators ˆJ  v,e   −1  cid:8 A jen ˜men; nen   cid:7 j α,  cid:7 m, cid:7 n  men ˜men    cid:4   j  j    ˆJ  vi  2 := ηjk ˆJ  vi   j  ˆJ  vi  k  with  ˆJ  vi  j  :=  ˆJ  vi,e  j  ,   74    cid:8   e∈E α  e∩vi cid:7 =∅  where ηjk denotes again the Cartan–Killing metric for su 2 . For each vi the opera- tor   ˆJ  vi  2 acts only on Hvi non trivially and has the eigenvalues lvi  lvi + 1 , where the particular value of lvi are determined by the values {jei } associated to the edges, that intersect in vi. lvi can be interpreted as the total angular momentum to which the individual angular momenta associated to the edges couple to. Hence, given the operators   ˆJ  vi  2 at each vertex vi we can label their associated eigenspaces by lvi and denote them by H . Likewise to the decomposition in terms of irreducible representations  cid:2 j associated to the edges the Hilbert space H α, cid:7 j further decomposes into the following direct sum  α, cid:7 j,lvi  H  α, cid:7 j =  H α, cid:7 j, cid:7 l with  cid:2 l =  lv1 ,··· , lvm , H  α, cid:7 j, cid:7 l :=  H  .  α, cid:7 j,lvi  m cid:21   i=1   cid:20    cid:7 l  Thus, the Hilbert space associated with a given graph α can be rewritten as   75    76    cid:20    cid:7 j, cid:7 l  Hα =  H  α, cid:7 j, cid:7 l  and states in this Hilbert space are characterized by the irreducible representations, that are associated to the edges and vertices of the graph. For this reason we can label the SNF also by this data yielding sα, cid:7 j, cid:7 l  cid:9 . The diﬀerence on the form in  64  is that here the coupling basis for angular momenta has been used for the Hilbert spaces Hlvi whereas in  64  the product basis was used. In the following sections  we will use both notations depending on which one is more suitable in the given situation. Now let us focus our discussion again on the kinematical Hilbert space  H = L2 A, dμAL . We would like to rewrite H as a direct sum of the individual Hαs. However, here we are faced with the following problem. Given a graph α and the edges of α, then this function would also be an element of H cid:3 α for some  cid:23 α, that a cylindrical function fα that does not depend on the holonomies of at least one of has less edges and vertices. Hence, Hα∩H cid:3 α  cid:10 = 0 and therefore the two spaces are not  orthogonal. A similar situation occurs when a function depends on the holonomies   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 52  52  K. Giesel  of two adjacent edges e1, e2 in α such that for an edge ˜e in  cid:23 α we have cid:23 e = e1 ◦ e2. As a consequence, we have to introduce some further rules on how the irreducible representations are associated to the edges of the graph in order to write H as an orthogonal decomposition of the Hαs. For this purpose we introduce the notion of  an admissible labeling of edges and vertices. Given a graph α we call a labeling of the edges and vertices of α by irreducible representations admissible if none of the edges carries a trivial representation and furthermore no two-valent vertex carries a trivial representation. We denote graph Hilbert spaces with admissible labelings by H cid:3   α. Then we can rewrite the kinematical Hilbert space for LQG as   cid:20    cid:20    cid:20   α  H =  H cid:3  α =  H α, cid:7 j cid:7 l.  α   cid:7 j, cid:7 l  admissible   77   This decomposition will be important in the following section when we discuss the dynamics of loop quantum gravity, that is encoded in the quantum Einstein’s equations of loop quantum gravity.  5. The Quantum Einstein’s Equations of Loop Quantum Gravity  Following the Dirac quantization program requires in the case of loop quantum gravity to implement the Gauss, diﬀeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraint as operators on the kinematical Hilbert space H introduced in the last section. Let  us denote these operators by  cid:26 CG  cid:2 Λ ,  cid:2 C   cid:2 N   and  cid:26 C N  , the quantum analog of the  classical Einstein’s equations, the so called quantum Einstein’s equation of loop quantum gravity are given by   cid:26  cid:2 C   cid:2 N  ψphys A  = 0,   cid:26 C N  ψphys A  = 0,   cid:26 CG  cid:2 Λ ψphys A  = 0,   78   where ψphy A  denotes the physical states, which live in the physical Hilbert space Hphys. The construction of the latter requires apart from ﬁnding the  general   solution to the quantum Einstein’s equations also to deﬁne an inner product on the set of physical states. In this Chapter we will restrict our discussion on the deﬁnition and solutions of the Gauss constraints. The remaining diﬀeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraint is discussed in detail in Chapter 2.  5.1. Solutions to the Gauss Constraint: Gauge-invariant Spinnet-  work Functions  can deﬁne an operator  cid:26 CG  cid:2 Λ  generating inﬁnitesimal gauge transformation or we  The Gauss constraint is solved using techniques from ordinary lattice gauge theory, where a similar constraint is involved in the theory. Technically, we have two pos- sibilities to construct the solution space, which we will denoted by HG . Either we can consider the exponentiated version ˆU  CG , that generates ﬁnite gauge transfor-  mations. The solution space will be the same in both cases. How the inﬁnitesimal gauge transformations can be implemented in the quantum theory is explained in   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 53  Quantum Geometry  53  detail for instance in Ref. [15]. Here we will consider ﬁnite gauge transforma- tion, implemented by unitary operators. As discussed before the holonomy A e  transforms under gauge transformation as A e  → Ag e  = g b e  A e g −1 e . The matrix elements of representations of A e  have thus the following transformation behavior  mene A e   → πj πj  mene Ag e   = πj = πj  mene g b e  A e g meαe  g b e   πj  −1 f  e   αeβe  A e  πj   79   −1 f  e  .  βene g  In order to construct gauge invariant SNF, ﬁrst we write the SNF in  64  in more compact form as  s  cid:8 A s   cid:7 j α, cid:7 n,  cid:7 m   cid:7 j α, cid:7 n,  cid:7 m  n cid:17    cid:2    cid:9  : Aα → C, A  cid:12 →  cid:8 A s  cid:9  :=  2jek + 1π   cid:9    cid:7 j α, cid:7 n,  cid:7 m  jek mek nek  A ek  .   80   Secondly, for the reason that the gauge transformation act on the beginning and ﬁnal points only, which are precisely the vertices of the graph, we rewrite the product of edges occurring above as   cid:8 A s   cid:7 j α, cid:7 n,  cid:7 m   cid:9  :=  2je + 1 πje  mene A e  .   81   k=1   cid:17    cid:17    cid:2   v∈v α   e∈E α  e∩v cid:7 =∅   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27    cid:9    cid:17    cid:2   Let us consider one individual vertex, at which we have n outgoing edges. For simplicity we will consider only outgoing edges ﬁrst, but will discuss the more general case below. At the vertex v the SNF transforms under gauge transformation as   cid:8 Ag  s   cid:7 j α, cid:7 n,  cid:7 m  =  2je + 1πje  meαe  g b e   πje  αene A e  .   82   v  e∈E α  e∩v cid:7 =∅ Hje . We can deﬁne a basis of Hv in terms of tensors  Let us denote the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces associated with each edge at  v as before by Hv = ⊗e∈E α  e∩v cid:7 =∅ of type  0, n , denoted by {ti} with components tα1···αn sentation je. We can deﬁne a dual basis, denoted by {˜ti} with components ˜ti associated with H∗ πje, by requiring  , one index for each repre- α1···αn je carries the dual representation  H∗ je , where each H∗  v = ⊗e∈E α  e∩v cid:7 =∅  i  ˜tj ti  = ˜tj  α1···αn tα1···αn  i  = δi j.   83   The gauge transformation acts on these tensors and its duals by  →  t  cid:3  →  ˜t  cid:3   tα1···αn i ˜ti α1···αn   α1···αn = πje1  g v  α1 i α1···αn = πje1  g v  β1  i −1 v    βn tβ1···βn i ˜ti β1···βn −1 v   ˜ti βn β1···βn , where we have used that the dual representation π g v   = π g notation πj   86  −1 v  T and used the n. Now we are interested in those tensors which  ··· πjen  g v  αn ··· πjen  g v  βn  mn g v   = πj g v  m  ··· πjen  g  = πje1  g   85    84   αn  αn  α1  α1  β1  β1   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 54  54  K. Giesel  are invariant under gauge transformations, which will be denoted by {ik}. In terms of their components gauge invariance means  πje1  g v  α1  β1  βn iβ1···βn  k  = iα1···αn  k  and likewise for their corresponding dual tensors. An intertwiner i between m dual representations πj1 ,··· , πjm and n representations πj1 ,··· πjn is a covariant map  ··· πjen  g v  αn m cid:21   → n cid:21   Hjek  k=1   cid:5 =1  i :  Hje cid:2    87    88   m cid:28   k=1  H∗  jek  ⊗ n cid:28    cid:5 =1  Hje cid:2  . We will  and can also be understood as an invariant tensor in  use this fact to construct gauge invariant SNF. In our example we have a vertex v with n outgoing edges. We achieve that the spin network is invariant under gauge transformation at v when we contract the SNF with the corresponding intertwiner iv at v, in our example this leads to  cid:8 A s  2je +1πje  = iv  cid:7 m   cid:30    cid:29    89    cid:27  cid:27  cid:27    cid:9    cid:7 mne A e     cid:7 j α, cid:7 n,  cid:7 m  v  inv   cid:17   cid:2  2je1 +1··· cid:2   e∈E α  e∩v cid:7 =∅   cid:2   =  2jen +1im1···mn  v  m1ne1  A e1  ··· πjen πje1  mnnen  A e  .  We generalize our discussion to a vertex, that has vm ingoing edges and vn outgoing edges. Again we can construct the gauge invariant part of the SNF at this vertex by contracting with an intertwiner iv, which has components of the form im1···mvn v n1···nvm . Thus, we can construct an invariant SNF by contracting the gauge variant SNF in  64  at each vertex with a corresponding intertwiner. We will denote the gauge invariant SNF s with the graph. The gauge invariant SNF is then given by  cid:17   cid:17    cid:9 , where  cid:2 i ∈ {iv  v ∈ V  α } is the set of intertwiners associated  cid:17    cid:2   cid:9  : Aα → C, A  cid:12 →  cid:8 A s  cid:9  :=  cid:2   2je + 1πje  A e    s  cid:8 A s   cid:7 j α, cid:7 i  cid:7 j α, cid:7 i  v∈V  α    cid:7 j α, cid:7 i   cid:7 j α, cid:7 i  iv   cid:9   e∈E α  e∩v cid:7 =∅ im1···mvn v n1···nvm  2je1 + 1··· cid:2   m1ne1  A e1     90   =  v∈V  α  ··· π jevn mvn nevn  A evn   π  2jevn+vm + 1πje1 mevn+1 n1  A evn+1  ··· π  jevn+1  jevn+vm mevn+vm nvm  A evn+vm  .  Here each vertex has vn outgoing and vm ingoing edges and we have labeled set of edges {e1,··· , cvn+vm } in such a way, that e1,··· , evn are the outgoing edges and evn+1 ,··· evn+vm are the ingoing edges. Going back to the decomposition of H in  77 , the gauge invariant Hilbert space corresponds to the case where the edges at all vertices couple to a total angular   February 22, 2017 10:18  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 55  momentum of zero. Thus, we have for the gauge invariant Hilbert space denoted by HG  inv  Quantum Geometry   cid:77   α   cid:77    cid:126 j, cid:126 l  admissible  HG inv =  Hα, cid:126 j cid:126 l=0.  55   91   The Hilbert space HG inv and therefore the solution space of the Gauss constraint is a subspace of the kinematical Hilbert space H. For the remaining constraints of the quantum Einstein’s equations, this will be no longer the case and the construction of their corresponding solution spaces is more complicated and will be discussed in Chapter 2.  In the discussion above we have derived HG  inv by starting with the conﬁguration space A and implemented the ﬁnite gauge transformations on H. Afterwards the solution space HG inv was constructed as a subspace of H. Alternatively, one can also obtain HG inv by considering the reduced quantum conﬁguration space A G, which consists of all generalized connections modulo  generalized  gauge transformations G. The latter are the extension of the gauge transformations G from the classical conﬁguration space A to the quantum conﬁgurations space A. In this case only gauge invariant cylindrical functions are considered from the beginning and the ﬁnal Hilbert space one obtains is also HG inv.  6. Geometric Operators and Their Properties  One of the special properties of the AL-representation used in loop quantum gravity introduced in the last section is that one can deﬁne operators corresponding to geo- metrical objects such as volume, area and length. For the KS-representation it has been shown that geometric operators can be implemented using similar techniques as for the AL-representation [21]. This is a consequence of the choice of the partic- ular smearing of the elementary variables discussed above yielding to the holonomy and ﬂux variables. If we had for instance chosen a 3-dimensional smearing like for the standard Fock quantization, the implementation of these geometrical operators in the quantum theory would not be possible.  Among those geometrical operators the most simple one is the area operator from the point of view of its quantization as well as with regards to the spectrum of these operators, therefore we will discuss this operator ﬁrst.  6.1. The Area Operator  The area operator was ﬁrst introduced by Smolin [26] and then further analyzed by Rovelli and Smolin in the loop representation [27], which is a representation based on loops instead of graphs and that was used in the early days of loop quantum gravity. Ashtekar and Lewandowski [28] discussed the spectrum of the area operator in the connection representation. In this section we want to discuss the implementation   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 56  56  K. Giesel  of the area operator as well as its spectrum in detail. At the end of the section we will brieﬂy comment on the volume and length operator.  The strategy one adopts to quantize is the following: As a ﬁrst step we have to express the classical expression, such as the area, in terms of Ashtekar variables  A, P  . Afterwards we need do ﬁnd a regularization of it, meaning that in our case the area needs to be written as a function of holonomies and ﬂuxes. The guiding principle for the regularization is, that in the limit where the regulator is removed, the classical area in terms of  A, P   should be recovered. Since corresponding operators for holonomies and ﬂuxes exist, the regularized area can then be promoted to a  regularized  operator on the kinematical Hilbert space H, whose detailed properties usually still depends on the chosen regularization. In a ﬁnal step, one has to show that in the limit where the chosen regulator tends to zero a well deﬁned operator is obtained. The classical area functional associated to a surface S is given by the following expression  AS =  d2u  det X∗q  u ,   92    cid:2    cid:5   U  ∗  where q denotes the ADM 3-metric and X : U → S is an embedding of the surface. Here U ⊂ R2 and X denotes the pull back of X. The coordinates on the embedded surface S are given by the embedding functions X a with a = 1, 2, 3 and let us denote the two coordinates parametrizing the surface by u1 and u2. Given the embedding we can construct two tangent vector ﬁelds on S  X a  ,u1 :=  , X a  ,u2 :=  ∂X a ∂u1  ∂X a ∂u2  and also a co-normal vector ﬁeld na that is determined from the condition  naX a  u,i = 0  for  i = 1, 2.   cid:6   ∗  det X  The determinant in the area functional can be expressed as −X a  q  = qu1u1 qu2u2−qu1u2 qu2u1 =  qabqcd.  95  In order to quantize the area functional we need to express it in terms of Ashtekar variables. For this purpose we consider the expression det q nanbqab and we can express the inverse metric as  ,u2 X d ,u1  u2 X d ,u2  ,u1 X c  ,u2 X c  ,u1 X b  ,u1 X b  X a  qab =  1 2  1  det q    cid:4 acd cid:4 bef qceqdf .  Furthermore, we see from  94  that na =  cid:4 abcX c  ,u1 X d  ,u2 yielding  det q nanbqab = det q nanb   cid:4 acd cid:4 bef qceqdf  1 2  1  det q   =  cid:4 ak cid:5 X k  ,u1 X  cid:5  = qu1u1qu2u2  ,u2  cid:4 bmnX m ,u1 X n ,u2 − qu1u2 qu2u1.  1 2   cid:4 acd cid:4 bef qceqdf   93    94    cid:7    96    97    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 57  Quantum Geometry  57   cid:2   The inverse metric has a simple form in Ashtekar variables given by qab = 1 kγ P a j = kγ  k δjk  det P   and depends only on the densitized triad.  j P b det q ea  From P a  j we get det q  = k3γ3 det P   yielding j P b  det q qab = k2γ2P a  k δjk  from which we can conclude using  97  that   cid:2    cid:31    cid:31   det X∗q  = kγ  nanbP a  j P b  k δjk = kγ  ⊥ j P  ⊥ k δjk,  P   98    99   ⊥ j denotes the projection of P a j  where P  surface. Note that often one chooses the basis τj := −iσj 2 in su 2  with σj being the Pauli matrices for which the Cartan-Killing metric on su 2  ηjk becomes ηjk := T r ad τj ad τk   = −2δjk and then one uses the Killing metric in the expression  in normal direction with respect to the  above and adjusts the pre-factors accordingly.  In order to quantize the area functional we need to choose a regularization of the classical expression. For this purpose, we choose a family of non-negative densities   in the limit  cid:4  → 0, that f  cid:10  u u is    on the surface S as regulators, which tend to δu u   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3  f  cid:10  u u  lim  cid:10 →0    = δx y ,   cid:3   where δu u regularized version of P    is the delta-function on S peaked at u. Given f  cid:10  ⊥ j ] cid:10  and deﬁned as  cid:3   ⊥ j  u  denoted by [P   cid:3   ⊥ j ] cid:10  u  :=  [P  d2u   cid:3  f  cid:10  u u  ⊥ j  u   P   .   cid:5   S  In the limit where the regulator is removed we have  ⊥ j ] cid:10  u  = P  ⊥ j  u .

Obviously, we have lim cid:10 →0[AS] cid:10  = AS in the classical theory. To deﬁne a regularized area operator [ ˆAS] cid:10  we use the following strategy: We replace P   in  101  by ⊥ ⊥ the operator ˆP j ] cid:10 . Afterwards we j ⊥ have to compute the action of [ ˆP j ] cid:10  yields a well deﬁned operator.

For this reason we can write the area operator in more compact form by introducing the set I S  of intersection points of edges of type up and type down, that is given by   108  This yields to the ﬁnal form of the area operator that we will use in the following  I S  = {v ∈ e ∩ Sκ S, e   cid:10 = 0, e ∈ E α }.  ˆASs   cid:7 j α,  cid:7 m, cid:7 n   cid:9  = 4πγ cid:9 2  p  κ S, e  ˆY  e,v   2 s   cid:7 j α,  cid:7 m, cid:7 n   cid:9 .   109    cid:4 2   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  1   cid:8    cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  cid:3  cid:8   v∈I S   e at v  Let us now discuss the spectrum of the area operator. At each intersection point v ∈ I S  we have edges of type up, edges of type down and edges of type in that will not contribute to the spectrum. In order to write the expression under the square root in  109  in compact form we introduce the following operators:   cid:8   ˆY v,u j  :=  ˆY  v,e  j  ˆY v,d j  :=  ˆY  v,e  j  .   110   e∈E v,u   e∈E v,d   Here E v, u , E v, d  denote all edges of type up and down respectively that intersect each other in the point v.

Furthermore, the operators   ˆY v,u 2,   ˆY v,d 2 and   ˆY v,u + ˆY v,d 2 mutually commute. Moreover, we choose an explicit basis τj = −iσj 2 for which the operators ˆY  v,e  satisfy the usual angular momentum algebra given by [ ˆY  v,e  i operators   ˆY  v,e  2 ≡ δjk ˆY  e,v  ˆY  v,e  k  , ˆY  v,e  locally act as  .

Hence, the same holds for the operators   ˆY v,u 2,   ˆY v,d 2, and   ˆY v,u + ˆY v,d 2, they act as Laplacians in the respective direct sum of representations. Therefore the spectrum of the operators involved in  111  can be easily computed and we obtain   112   Spec  ˆAS  = 4πγ cid:9 2 p  2ju,v ju,v + 1  + 2jd,v jd,v + 1  − ju+d,v ju+d,v + 1 .   cid:8    cid:31   v∈I S    113  Here ju,v, jd,v denote the total angular momentum of the edges of type up  down respectively  at the intersection point v and ju+d,v total coupled angular momentum of the up and down edges whose values range between ju,v − jd,v ≤ ju+d,v ≤ ju,v + jd,v. Let us consider the eigenvalue at one intersection point v. The smallest possible eigenvalue that we can get occurs when either ju,v = 0 and jd,v = 1 2 or vice versa. The eigenvalue denoted by λ0 is non vanishing and given by  √  λ0 = 2πγ cid:9 2 p  3   114   and is known as the area gap in loop quantum gravity. The area gap plays an important role in the description of black hole physics within loop quantum gravity and black hole entropy calculations can be used the ﬁx the value of the Immirzi parameter γ as discussed in Chapter 7.  6.2. The Volume Operator  The volume operator enters crucially into the construction of the dynamics of the quantum Einstein’s equations for the reason that the classical co-triad is expressed as the Poisson bracket between the connection and the classical volume functional using the Thiemann identity  see Chapter 2 . In the case of the area operator, the area functional depends on the momenta P a j only, which is also true for the classical volume functional, that for a given region R in the spatial manifold Σ reads  VR =  d3x  det q  =  kγ   3 2  d3x   det P a j  .   115    cid:2    cid:5   R   cid:31    cid:5   R  Likewise to the case of the area operator we need to choose a regularization of VR in order to write the volume functional in terms of ﬂuxes P  S, f   for which well deﬁned   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 60  60  K. Giesel   116    117   operators exist yielding as a ﬁrst step a regularized expression of the classical volume  functional VR. For the latter it is natural to choose a partition P  cid:10  of the spatial region R in terms of cubic cells C  cid:10  and adapted 2-surfaces for each cubic cell. For this purpose we introduce a coordinate system  xa  and assume that each C cid:10  has a volume of less than  cid:4  in the chosen coordinate system and that two diﬀerent cells share only points on their boundaries. For each cubic cell C  cid:10  we introduce three 2- surfaces {Sa  a = 1, 2, 3} chosen in a way such that the coordinates components xa are constant along Sa for a = 1, 2, 3 following the notation in Ref. [30]. Furthermore, each Sa has the property that it divides C  cid:10  into two disjoint parts. We can now use the surfaces {Sa  a = 1, 2, 3} to formulate a regularized volume functional denoted R as a function of ﬂuxes over the surfaces {Sa  a = 1, 2, 3}. Going back to the by V  cid:10  deﬁnition of the ﬂux P  S, f   in  35  we will choose as the smearing functions f j the su 2  basis elements τj and deﬁne Pj S  := P  S, τj . Given this, we have   cid:8    cid:2   C cid:3 ∈P  cid:3   QC cid:3   V  cid:10  R =  kγ   3 2  with  QC cid:3  :=   cid:4 jk cid:5  cid:4 abcPj Sa Pk Sb P cid:5  Sc .  1 3!  In the classical theory we have lim cid:10 →0 V  cid:10  R = VR, however in the quantum theory the removal of the regular has to be taken with more care. While in the case of the area operator after the regulator has been removed the ﬁnal operator does not depend on the chosen background structure of the regularization, a diﬀerent situation occurs for the volume operator. In the case of the volume operator once the regulator is removed, the resulting operator still depends on the chosen partition and thus carries a memory of the chosen regularization. As a consequence this operator depends on the chosen background structure during the regularization procedure and therefore the limit does not yield an appropriate candidate for a volume operator because it fails to be covariant under spatial diﬀeomorphisms. This problem can be circumvented by ﬁrst averaging over the possible background structures, whose dependence enters into the volume operator in a rather simple way, before removing the regulator. The requirements that we obtain a well deﬁned operator when the regulator is removed as well as that the ﬁnal operator is covariant under spatial diﬀeomorphisms, are restrictive enough to uniquely determine the ﬁnal form of the operator up to a global constant, that we will denote regularization constant creg in the following.  In the literature two diﬀerent volume operators exist, one introduced by Rovelli and Smolin  RS  [27] and one introduced by Ashtekar and Lewandowski  AL  [29], which come out of a priori equally justiﬁed but diﬀerent regularization techniques. In the classical theory both regularized versions, the RS- as well as the AL-volume — although being of diﬀerent kind — yield the classical volume functional once the regulator is removed. However, in the quantum theory the removal of the regulator is more subtle and this is the reason why one ends up with two diﬀerent quantum   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 61  Quantum Geometry  61  operators. Both volume operators act non-trivially only on vertices where at least three edges intersect. At a given vertex the operators have the following form  ˆVv,RS = cRS   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  ˆQIJK   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  1  2   cid:8   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27   cid:8   eI∩eJ∩eK =v  eI∩eJ∩eK =v   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  1  2  ˆVv,AL = cAL   cid:4  eI , eJ , eK   ˆQIJK  .   118   i  ˆY  v,eJ   j  ˆY  v,eK   k  Here ˆQIJK :=  cid:4 ijk ˆY  v,eI   is an operator involving only ﬂux operators and thus right and left invariant vector ﬁelds and cRS, cAL are regularization con- stants. The sum runs over all ordered triples of edges intersecting at the vertex v. A detailed discussion about the regularization of the volume operator can for instance be found in Refs. [15] and [30]. The main diﬀerences between these two operators is that the RS-operator is not sensitive to the orientation of the triples of edges and is therefore covariant under homeomorphisms. The AL-operator has likewise to the κ S, e  in the area operator a similar sign factor  cid:4  eI , eJ , eK  that can take the values {+1, 0,−1} and is the sign of the cross product of the tangent vectors at v of the triple of edges ei, ej, ek that intersect at this vertex v. Furthermore, the sum over triples of edges involved in both operators occurs outside the square root in case of the RS and inside the square root in case of the AL-operator. Due to the sign factor  cid:4  eI, eJ , eK   the operator ˆVAL is covariant only under diﬀeomorphisms. The spectral analysis of the volume operator is more complicated than for the area operator and can in general not be computed analytically. A general formula for the computation of matrix elements of the AL-volume operator has been derived in Ref. [31]. Those techniques have been used to analyze the spectrum of the volume operator numerically up to a vertex valence of 7 in a series of papers [32]. Their work showed that the spectral properties of the volume operator depend on the embedding of the vertex that enters via the sign factors  cid:4  ei, ej, ek  into the construction of the AL-operator. Particularly, the presence of a volume gap, that is a smallest non-vanishing eigenvalue, depends on the geometry of the vertex. A consistency check for both volume operators has been discussed in Ref. [33] where the Thiemann identity, discussed in detail in Chapter 2, has been used to deﬁne an alternative ﬂux operator. The alternative ﬂux operator is then compared to the usual ﬂux operator and consistency of both operators could for instance ﬁx the undetermined regularization constant cAL =  cid:9 3 48 in the volume operator. p  Furthermore, the RS-operator did not pass this consistency check and the reason that it worked for the AL-operator is exactly the presence of those sign factors  cid:4  eI , eJ , eK  in the AL-operator.  √  A technique to compute matrix elements of the volume operator with respect to semiclassical states analytically was developed in Ref. [34]. This method relies on the idea of an expansion of the matrix elements of the volume operator in a power series of matrix elements of operators, that can be computed analytically. These   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 62  62  K. Giesel  1 cid:5    cid:31   0  1 cid:5    cid:31   0  operators in the expansion are chosen in such a way that the error caused by this expansion can be estimated and can be well controlled.  6.3. The Length Operator  A length operator for LQG was introduced in Ref. [35]. The length operator is in some sense the most complicated one among the kinematical geometrical operators. Let us recall the length of a curve c : [0, 1] → Σ classically is given by   cid:9  c  =  qab c t   ˙ca t  ˙cb t dt =  a c t  ej ei  b c t   ˙ca t  ˙cb t δijdt,   119   here ˙ca denotes the components of the tangent vector associated to the curve. When we express the metric qab in terms of Ashtekar variables we obtain  qab =   cid:4 acd cid:4 bef  cid:4 ijk cid:4 imn P c  e P n f  j P d k P m det P    ,  k 4   120   which is a non-polynomial function in terms of the electric ﬁelds and therefore a regularization in terms of ﬂux operators similar to the area and volume operator does not exist. Furthermore, the denominator being the square of the volume density cannot be deﬁned on a dense set in H because it has a huge kernel. One possibility to quantize the length used in Ref. [35] is to use for the co-triads that occur in  119  the Thiemann identity and replace them by a Poisson bracket between the connection and the volume functional. This yields a length operator that involves a square root of two commutators between holonomy operators along the curve c and the volume operator. In this way the inverse volume density can be avoided and the volume occurs only linearly in the commutator. Also, the length operator does not change the graph or the spin labels of the edges likewise to the area and volume operator. However, since the length operator becomes even a function of the volume operator its spectral analysis becomes even more complicated than for the volume operator itself and very little about the spectrum of the length operator is known except for low valence vertices.  Another length operator was introduced in Ref. [36], where the Thiemann iden- tity was not used for the quantization. The regularization adapted in Ref. [36] is motivated from the dual picture of quantum geometry and uses that the curve can be expressed as an intersection of two surfaces. This allows to express the tangent vector of the curve in terms of the normals of the surfaces. The inverse volume issue discussed above is circumvented by using a Tikhonov regularization for the inverse RS-volume-operator. For this length operator the spectral properties have only been analyzed for a vertex of valence 4, which is monochromatic, that is all spins are identical. Another alternative length operator for LQG has been discussed in [37] where a diﬀerent regularization has been chosen such that the ﬁnal length operator can be expressed in terms of other geometrical objects — the area, volume and ﬂux operators. In this work the AL-operator is used and the inverse   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 63  Quantum Geometry  63  volume operator is also deﬁned using a Tikhonov regularization similar to the one in Ref. [36].  7. Summary  In this Chapter we presented a brief introduction to the kinematical setup of loop quantum gravity [15, 16]. Loop quantum gravity can be understood as a framework for canonically quantizing general relativity. This approach leads to a quantum theory based on quantum geometry for the reason that not only the matter part of the theory but also the geometry itself is quantized. In Section 1 we brieﬂy mentioned earlier attempts to canonically quantize general relativity using ADM- variables. However, these approaches could only provide a quantum theory that was constructed at a rather formal level since neither the functional analytical details about the kinematical Hilbert space had been worked out nor could the dynamics of the quantum theory be implemented rigorously. But precisely the quantization of the constraints that encode the dynamics of the quantum theory needs to be understood in great detail if one wants to analyze characteristic properties and consequences of quantum geometry. Particularly, the Hamiltonian constraint is a non-polynomial function of the elementary phase space variables in contrast to the Hamiltonian used in other gauge theories in the context of the standard model of particle physics. Nevertheless, these earlier results were important because they already showed what kind of complications occur if one tries to carry over the standard quantization used in ordinary quantum mechanics to general relativity. Progress regarding this aspect was made when the connection variables were intro- duced by Ashtekar [7] leading to a reformulation of general relativity in terms of an SU 2  gauge theory as discussed in Section 2. As a consequence it involves next to the spatial diﬀeomorphism and the Hamiltonian constraint also known from the ADM-formalism an additional SU 2  Gauss constraint. Although, the Hamiltonian constraint keeps its non-polynomial form also with respect to these new variables the advantage of the connection formulation is, that general relativity can be for- mulated in the language of ordinary gauge theories. This leads to a form of the constraint in the new variables that looks much closer to what we are familiar with from other gauge theories. Therefore, techniques developed in those ﬁelds could be taken as a point of reference for constructing the quantum theory underlying loop quantum gravity. Taking this into account the choice of holonomies and ﬂuxes as presented in Section 3 is a very natural choice as elementary phase space variables for the theory. We introduced the notion of cylindrical functions and ﬂux vector ﬁelds acting on them in order to give a precise deﬁnition of the holonomy–ﬂux al- gebra used in loop quantum gravity. The choice of the classical algebra and its related properties are important in the sense that the corresponding quantum the- ory will of course depend on the particular choice because we obtain the quantum theory by ﬁnding representations of the underlying classical algebra. In the case of the holonomy–ﬂux algebra the ﬁrst representation that was found is the Ashtekar–   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 64  64  K. Giesel  Lewandowski [38, 39] representation discussed in Section 4.d Interestingly, later the LOST-theorem [18] proved that this is the only representation of the holonomy–ﬂux algebra if the symmetries of the theory, particularly the spatial diﬀeomorphisms are taken very seriously. Other representations that violate one of the assumptions used in the LOST-theorem were found by Sahlmann and Koslowski [22]. We ﬁnished Section 4 by introducing spin networks which provide an orthonormal basis for the kinematical Hilbert space. Beside being a very useful tool as far as computations in loop quantum gravity are concerned they also deliver insight into the question how quantum states look like in loop quantum gravity. Each spin network is deﬁned on a graph that consists of a ﬁnite number of edges that are one-dimensional objects embedded into the spatial manifold we obtained from 3+1 split. These edges are labeled with so called spin quantum numbers and the vertices of the graph carry intertwiners. These data can be understood as describing a particular state of quan- tum geometry at the kinematical level and by varying these data we would obtain diﬀerent states of quantum geometry. To go beyond the kinematical level we have to consider the dynamics of quantum geometry that is described by the quantum Einstein’s equations. These are the classical analogue of Einstein’s equations in general relativity. In the context of Dirac quantization for constrained systems the formulation of the quantum Einstein’s equations requires to implement the classical constraints as operators on the kinematical Hilbert space. If one considers a reduced phase space quantization approach for loop quantum gravity [12], then formulating the dynamics requires to deﬁne a  physical  Hamiltonian on the physical Hilbert space. The latter is obtained by quantizing directly the reduced phase space. A more detailed presentation of the quantum dynamics can be found in Chapter 2. In Section 5 we only start to introduce the topic of quantum dynamics and we re- strict our discussion to the construction of solutions to the Gauss constraint only. The corresponding solutions are gauge invariant spin network functions and the re- maining dynamical operators associated with ﬁnite spatial diﬀeomorphisms and the inﬁnitesimal Hamiltonian constraint are well deﬁned on the gauge invariant Hilbert space. We ﬁnished this Chapter with a brief review on geometrical operators. These are operators associated with geometrical quantities like length, area and volume. That these operators can be implemented is a special property of the kinematical representation used in loop quantum gravity and related to the fact that holonomies as well as ﬂuxes are used as the elementary variables. In a Fock representation, used in ordinary quantum ﬁeld theory, those operators are not well deﬁned. At the kine- matical level the spectrum of the area operator can be computed analytically and interestingly it turns out to be discrete and a smallest non-vanishing eigenvalue exists in a so called area gap. For the volume and length operator the complete  dSince this Chapter was submitted, Dittrich, Geiller and others have opened up the possibility of constructing a representation that is complementary to the Ashtekar–Lewandowski representation discussed here. See, e.g., B. Dittrich and M.Geiller, arXiv:1604.05195, and Chapter 5 in this volume.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 65  Quantum Geometry  65  spectrum is still unknown but one has analyzed the volume operator for special spin networks states with low valence [32].  The kinematical setup introduced in this Chapter is the mathematical founda- tion for most of the research done in loop quantum gravity. In the context of loop quantum cosmology, that is a symmetry reduced model for loop quantum grav- ity and introduced in Chapter 6, the kinematical representation discussed here is adopted and specialized to the context of cosmological models. Also the particular implementation of the quantum Einstein’s equations discussed in the Chapter 2 is closely related to the choice of the kinematical representation. In the context of black hole physics the area operator plays an important role and provides new in- sights on a quantum mechanical description of the black hole entropy as discussed in Chapter 7. Furthermore, a motivation for spin foam models, which aims to provide the corresponding covariant formulation of loop quantum gravity in the context of path integral quantization, is again the kinematical framework presented in this Chapter. Therefore, also in the covariant approach the kinematical Hilbert space plays an important role. More details on the covariant approach can be found in Chapters 3, 4 and 5.  References  [1] S.

Introduction  As discussed in Chapter 1, by virtue of its diﬀeomorphism invariance, the classi- cal Hamiltonian dynamics of gravity is generated by constraints. The deﬁnition of its quantum dynamics then necessitates the construction of quantum operator versions of these constraints. A non-trivial requirement on these constraint opera- tors is that they provide an anomaly free representation of their classical Poisson bracket algebra. As for any gauge theory, the anomaly free requirement ensures that the quantum theory has the correct number of degrees of freedom. In ad- dition, the work of Hojman, Kuchaˇr and Teitelboim  HKT  [1] implies that such a requirement is closely connected with the emergence of spacetime covariance in the quantum theory. The transformations generated by the diﬀeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints can be interpreted in terms of deformations of the Cauchy slice within the dynamically generated spacetime. HKT show that the algebra of these deformations obtains a characteristic structure which depends only on the spacetime covariance of the gravitational dynamics and is independent of its ﬁner details. Hence, it is believed that a notion of spacetime covariance can emerge in quantum theory only if this algebra is represented without anomalies.  Since the basic variables of LQG are an SU  2  connection and its conjugate triad, the classical theory also has a ‘Gauss Law’ constraint which generates triad rotations and imposes SU  2  invariance. It follows that we may ignore this constraint as long as we work with  linear combinations of  the SU  2  gauge invariant spin network states discussed in Chapter 1. Accordingly in canonical LQG, our aim is to construct the action of the diﬀeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraint operators on such states in such a way as to ensure an anomaly free representation of their classical Poisson brackets, and, in accordance with the tenets of Dirac quantization, identify physical states with the kernel of these constraints.  69   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 70  70  A. Laddha & M. Varadarajan  The most direct way to construct the constraint operators is to express the clas- sical constraints in terms of the basic phase space functions of the theory, namely the holonomies and ﬂuxes, and replace these functions by their quantum operator correspondents in the resulting expressions. Unfortunately, this strategy cannot be employed due to the following reason. The expressions for the classical con- straints involve the connection and its curvature. These local ﬁelds must then be re-expressed in terms of non-local holonomies. While in classical theory these local ﬁelds at a point can be obtained through the limiting behavior of a set of holonomies around loops which shrink to the point, in quantum theory the limit of the corre- sponding operators does not exist. The limit of this shrinking procedure is ill deﬁned because the background independent Hilbert space is unable to distinguish a ‘large loop’ from a ‘small’ one if they are diﬀeomorphic images of each other.  The above obstruction can be bypassed for the diﬀeomorphism constraints by shifting attention to the ﬁnite transformations which they generate. These ﬁnite transformations correspond to the group of ﬁnite spatial diﬀeomorphisms. The anomaly free requirement translates to the requirement that the group structure of these transformations be correctly represented in quantum theory. Since LQG provides a unitary representation of the group of spatial diﬀeomorphisms, this re- quirement is satisﬁed. The identiﬁcation of diﬀeomorphism invariant states then corresponds to the identiﬁcation of states which are invariant under these unitary  transformations. The Hilbert space of such states, HDiﬀ , can be constructed by an  application of group averaging techniques [2]. We describe this, by now standard material, in the ﬁrst part of Section 2. The above considerations bypass the need for operators corresponding to the generators of ﬁnite diﬀeomorphisms. Neverthe- less, it is of interest to enquire if the action of such operators can be deﬁned as a suitable limit of a family of operators corresponding to ﬁnite diﬀeomorphisms in the neighborhood of identity. For the same reason which precludes the deﬁnition of a connection operator as a limit of holonomies, this limit does not exist on the LQG Hilbert space. However, Lewandowski and Marolf showed that it is possible to deﬁne such a limit on an appropriate deformation of diﬀeomorphism invariant states [3]. In the second part of Section 2 we exhibit the space of these deformed states known as a habitat and show that it supports a representation of the Poisson bracket algebra of the diﬀeomorphism constraints.  The Poisson bracket of the Hamiltonian constraint with itself involves structure functions. As a result, standard group averaging techniques, which are predicated on a Lie group structure, cannot be applied to the ﬁnite transformations generated by the Hamiltonian constraint. Indeed, a satisfactory treatment of the Hamiltonian constraint in quantum theory constitutes one of the key open problems in canonical LQG and we shall devote the rest of this Chapter to a discussion of this problem. In the absence of group averaging techniques, one attempts a direct construction of the Hamiltonian constraint operator by replacing the classical ﬁelds which comprise it with quantum operators. As mentioned above, due to the conﬂict between the   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 71  Quantum Dynamics  71  non-locality of the holonomies and the local nature of the classical ﬁelds, this cannot be done exactly. Hence, Thiemann adopted the following step by step procedure:  1  Fix a one parameter family of triangulations, T cid:10  of the manifold where  cid:4  is a positive parameter whose vanishing signals the ‘continuum limit’ of inﬁnitely ﬁne triangulation.  2  Approximate the local ﬁelds comprising the constraint by classical holonomies around small loops and classical ﬂuxes through small areas, the smallness being characterized by  cid:4 , so that the approximations become exact in the continuum limit.  3  Replace the holonomy-ﬂux functions by the corresponding operators and at- tempt to deﬁne the continuum limit of the action of the resulting ﬁnite triangula- tion Hamiltonian constraint operator ˆC cid:10 , the hope being that while the action of the individual approximants to the local ﬁelds admit no such limit, the conglomeration of these approximants which form ˆC cid:10  together, does admit such a limit.  Remarkably, Thiemann was able to implement these steps successfully. Unfor- tunately, this implementation suﬀers from the following shortcomings. First, in the continuum limit, the operator action depends on the choice of the holonomy-ﬂux approximants  associated with the ﬁnite triangulation  from an inﬁnite number of candidates. Second, the anomaly free requirement cannot provide a discriminatory tool for the correct set of choices. The reason is that in this implementation, the continuum limit of the commutator of a pair of Hamiltonian constraints as well as the operator version of the classical Poisson bracket can be seen to vanish for a very large class of choices of approximants. Finally, direct analogs of these choices are found to be physically inappropriate in toy model and minisuperspace situa- tions [4, 5]. Hence, current research focuses on removing these shortcomings from Thiemann’s remarkable work. Accordingly the layout of the rest of this Chapter is as follows. In Section 3, we review Thiemann’s work, discuss its inadequacies and suggest a strategy to overcome them, based in part on the study of toy mod- els [4]. The habitat construction of Section 2 will be seen to play a key role in this discussion. In Section 4 we describe recent work on the quantum dynamics of a weak coupling limit of Euclidean gravity. Section 5 is devoted to work on Euclidean gravity. Section 6 contains a discussion of directions for further research. The ex- citing line of research which emerges from the considerations of Sections 3-6 may be summarized as follows: Attempt to code the action of the Hamiltonian constraint in terms of phase space dependent spatial diﬀeomorphisms, and, use the key feature of LQG — namely, the unitary action of  phase space independent  diﬀeomorphisms — to implement this operator action.  2. Spatial Diﬀeomorphism Invariance  We refer to the set of states generated by the action of all diﬀeomorphisms on a given state as the orbit of the state. Clearly, this orbit is invariant under diﬀeo- morphisms. Intuitively, if we construct a state which is the sum over all states in   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 72  72  A. Laddha & M. Varadarajan  an orbit, such a state would be diﬀeomorphism invariant. We shall see that this in- tuitive idea can be rigorously implemented by interpreting the summing procedure as a group averaging map from kinematic to diﬀeomorphism invariant states [7]. Accordingly, Section 2.1 describes the deﬁning properties of a group averaging map and their role in the construction of the corresponding group invariant Hilbert space. Starting from an intuitive ‘sum over states in an orbit’, Section 2.2 constructs an essentially unique group averaging map for the group of spatial diﬀeomorphisms in LQG as well as the corresponding Hilbert space of diﬀeomorphism invariant states.a Section 2.3 constructs the Lewandowski-Marolf habitat and shows that it supports a representation of the Poisson bracket algebra of the diﬀeomorphism constraints.   1    2   2.1.

The Diﬀeomorphism Invariant Hilbert Space    G da  cid:8 ψ ˆU  a    Note that if there exists a left and right invariant measure da on G, the formal G da ˆU  a ψ cid:9   expression η ψ cid:9   :=   −1  serves as a candidate † deﬁnition of a group averaging map. Indeed if this integral expression can be given meaning as an element of D cid:3  , the reader may verify that this expression satisﬁes the deﬁning properties of a group averaging map. Since, to the best of our knowledge, no such measure is available for the diﬀeomorphism group G := Diﬀ, we replace the integral over the group by a sum as follows. Let s cid:9  be an SU  2  gauge invariant spin net. Let the coarsest graph underlying it be γ s  with edges {e}, vertices {v}, edge colors {je, e ∈ γ s } and intertwiners {Iv, v ∈ γ}. The unitary action ˆU  φ  of a diﬀeomorphism φ on s cid:9  yields the spin net ˆU  φ s cid:9  =: φ s  cid:9  which is based on the graph φ γ s   with edge colorings {jφ e  = je} and intertwiners {Iφ v  = Iv}. Let [s] denote the set of distinct  and hence mutually orthornormal  diﬀeomorphic images of s cid:9  under Diﬀ. s cid:9  as  We deﬁne the action of the putative group averaging map η on the spin net state   cid:8   ¯s cid:11 ∈[s]  η s cid:9   = η[s]   cid:8 ¯s,  where η[s] is a positive parameter which we shall determine below. Since the ele- ments of [s] are orthonormal, it follows that the natural action of η s cid:9   on any spin net either vanishes or equals η[s] from which it follows that η maps D to D cid:3  where D is the ﬁnite span of spin net states and D cid:3  is its algebraic dual. Since the sum is over all distinct diﬀeomorphic images of s cid:9 , it follows  as can be explicitly checked  that property  1  holds. It is useful to rewrite this sum as follows. Let Syms be the subset of Diﬀ which leaves s invariant. It follows that elements of the orbit [s] are in correspondence with right cosets of Diﬀ by Syms so that we may write:   cid:8   η s cid:9   := η[s]    ˆU  φc s cid:9    †  c∈Diﬀ Syms  where φc is any element of the coset c. Next, we show that D and its image by η split into superselection sectors i.e. sectors which cannot be mapped to each other by any element of O. Let s1, s2 be spin nets with graph labels γ s1 , γ s2  such that γ s1   cid:10 = γ s2 . It is straightfor- ward to see that there are inﬁnitely many diﬀeomorphisms φs1 which move s2 cid:9  but keep s1 cid:9  invariant.b From the diﬀeomorphism invariance of elements of O we have  that   cid:8 s2 ˆOs1 cid:9  =  cid:8 s2 ˆO ˆU  †   φs1  s1 cid:9  =  cid:8 s2 ˆU  †   φs1   ˆOs1 cid:9    7   so that the state ˆOs1 cid:9  has the same component along spin networks of the form φs1  s2  cid:9 . Since there are inﬁnitely many of the latter, it follows from ˆO : D → D bThese are generated by any vector ﬁeld which vanishes everywhere on γ s1  but is transverse to an open subset of γ s2 .   5    6    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 74  74  A. Laddha & M. Varadarajan  that  cid:8 s2 ˆOs1 cid:9  = 0. This shows that at the kinematic level two spin nets lie in  diﬀerent superselection sectors unless their underlying graphs coincide. It is then straightforward to see that a similar argument implies that their group averaged images lie in diﬀerent superselection sectors unless their underlying graphs are diﬀeomorphic.  Adopting the attitude that each such superselection sector provides a diﬀerent physical realization, an unambiguous speciﬁcation of the putative group averaging map only requires a determination of the parameters η[s] within each such sector. We show that the imposition of requirement  3  uniquely determines these coeﬃcients within such a sector  up to an irrelevant overall constant which can be absorbed into the Hilbert space inner product for the sector . We deﬁne the subgroup, Sym0 s of Syms to be the set of edge preserving elements of Diﬀ:  Sym0  s := {φ ∈ Diﬀ : φ e  = e ∀e ∈ γ s }.  It is straightforward to check that Sym0 s is a normal subgroup of Syms and that the quotient group Ds := Syms Sym0 s is the ﬁnite group of allowed edge permutationsc which leave s invariant. We denote the cardinality of Ds by Ds. Clearly Ds is a diﬀeomorphism invariant number i.e. Ds = D¯s for all ¯s cid:9  ∈ [s].  Let s1 and s2 be two spin networks based on diﬀeomorphic graphs  for otherwise  property  3  trivializes . We want to impose the condition  η  ˆOs1 cid:9  [s2 cid:9 ] = η s1 cid:9  [ ˆO  †s2 cid:9 ],  for all ˆO ∈ O. Since ˆO : D → D, the vector ˆOs1 cid:9  admits an expansion of the form,  ˆOs1 cid:9  =  λi ˆU  φi s2 cid:9  + χ cid:9  with  cid:8 s2 ˆU  φ χ cid:9  = 0 ∀ φ ∈ Diﬀ .   10    8    9   The vectors λi ˆU  φi s2 cid:9  represent the components of ˆOs1 cid:9  along the orbit of s2 cid:9  and are taken to be orthogonal; χ cid:9  encodes the remaining vectors orthogonal to the span of the orbit of s2 cid:9 . It is straightforward to check that the left-hand side of  9  then evaluates to η  ˆOs1 cid:9  [s2 cid:9 ] = η[s2]  cid:8  To evaluate the right-hand side, we ﬁrst rewrite η s1 cid:9   as a sum over Sym0  cosets as follows. Consider the auxiliary map deﬁned by  !  i λi.  s1  n cid:8   i=1  η0 s cid:9   := η[s]    ˆU  φc s cid:9    †  .  c∈Diﬀ Sym0  s  where, similar to  6 , Diﬀ Sym0 a choice of diﬀeomorphism in each such coset c. It then follows that:   12  Using  11  and  12  and the commutativity of Diﬀ with O, it is straightforward to check that:  s is the set of right cosets of Diﬀ by Sym0 η0 s cid:9   = Dsη s cid:9  .  cid:8   s and φc is   11    13   η s1 cid:9  [ ˆO  †s2 cid:9 ] = η[s1]  λixi  i  cBy ‘allowed’ we mean that there exists a diﬀeomorphism which implements each such permuta- tion.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 75  75   14    15   where  Quantum Dynamics   cid:8   c∈Diﬀ Sym0  s1  xi := Ds1−1   cid:8 s2 ˆU  φc φi s2  cid:9 ,  Since  cid:8 φi s2  ˆOs1 cid:9  = λi  cid:10 = 0 it follows from the discussion centered around  7  that φi s2  = Sym0 γ φi s2   = γ s1 . In particular Sym0 s1 and the sum is independent of the representative choices c → φc. Let ci := φ −1 i Sym0 s1 be the right coset of −1 Diﬀ by Sym0 i φSym0 for appropriate φ ∈ Diﬀ. Nonzero contributions to  14  come from elements φ ∈ Syms  . It follows that there are Dφi s2  such terms and so we obtain:  . All other cosets can be obtained as φ  s1 which contains φ  −1 i  s1   i  2  −1Ds2    xi = Ds1 !  . Assuming ˆO is such that  where we have used the diﬀeomorphism invariance of Dφi s2  to replace it with i λi  cid:10 = 0  if no such observable exist, the states Ds2 would be superselected  we conclude that in order to satisfy  9  we must have that η[s1] η[s2] = Ds1 . This implies that η[s] = CDs for some C > 0, where C is constant within the superselection sector containing η s cid:9  . With this choice of parameters η[s] it is straightforward to verify that equation  6  satisﬁes all the deﬁning properties of a group averaging map so that the space of diﬀeomorphism invariant states can then be converted to a Hilbert space HDiﬀ following the steps   Ds2  sketched in Section 2.1.  It is also straightforward to verify that with the same choice of parameters η[s], the group averaging map can be extended to act on the dense domain of cylindrical functions and that the properties  1 - 3  hold with O extended to include Diﬀ invariant observables which preserve this larger domain. Thus, our treatment here rigorously and uniquely derives the group averaging maps of Refs. [8, 9].  2.3. The Lewandowski–Marolf habitat Consider, for simplicity, a spin net state s cid:9  which has no non-trivial discrete sym- metries  so that Ds consists only of the identity element  and whose underlying graph γ s  has n vertices. Clearly, these properties are diﬀeomorphism invariant and, hence, shared by any spinnet in [s]. Next, consider any complex valued func- tion f on n copies of the Cauchy slice i.e. f : Σn → C. Let the vertices of ¯s cid:9  ∈ [s] be located at the points ¯v1, .., ¯vn. The n-tuple of points  ¯v1, .., ¯vn  deﬁne a point in Σn. Denote the evaluation of f on this point by f  ¯v1, .., ¯vn  and deﬁne the habitat state Ψ[s],f ∈ D cid:3   as:  Ψ[s],f =   cid:8 ¯sf  ¯v1, .., ¯vn .   16    cid:8   ¯s cid:11 ∈[s]  Comparing this expression with that of equation  5 , we see that habitat states are ‘deformations’ of diﬀeomorphism invariant ones, the deformation being introduced by the weight function f .

The above equations are equalities between elements of D cid:3  and can be easily checked, for example, by evaluating their action on D. Equivalently, equation  17  can also be checked di- rectly by evaluating the  dual  action of ˆU  φξ t   on each bra in the sum  16  and re-labeling the summation index. Equation  18  then also follows straightforwardly from equation  17  by evaluating the limit on each such bra. Equation  18  shows that the habitat supports the action of the generator of spatial diﬀeomorphisms ˆD  cid:2 ξ  which is just the diﬀeomorphism constraint Da x  smeared with a shift vector ﬁeld ξa. Clearly the commutator of two such generators yields the commutator of the associate shift vector ﬁelds and the kernel of the diﬀeomorphism constraint  for any choice of shift  consists of habitat states with f constant, which, as expected are just the diﬀeomorphism invariant states of Section 2.2.  3. The Thiemann Construction  Section 3.1 reviews the key features of Thiemann’s seminal work [8, 10]. Section 3.2 suggests improvements to Thiemann’s detailed choices while retaining his basic framework. Section 3.3 discusses the role of toy models in arriving at these choices. Before we start, we list some useful classical identities and expressions.  The unit density weight Hamiltonian constraint for Lorentzian gravity, CL can be written as CL = CE +  CL − CE  where CE is the Hamiltonian constraint for  Euclidean gravity,  CE =   cid:4 ijkEa i Eb √ j q  2  Fabk.  On the Gauss Law constraint surface the Poisson bracket between a pair of Hamil- tonian constraints smeared with lapses N, M is proportional to the diﬀeomorphism constraint:  {CL N  , CL M  } = −{CE N  , CE M  } =   N∇aM − M∇aN   qabDb x    cid:5   Σ  dIf Ds is non-trivial, f is required to be symmetric under the action of Ds on its arguments.   19    20    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 77  Quantum Dynamics  77   21   Let VR be the spatial volume of a region R.

Thiemann’s Hamiltonian Constraint and its Commutator  Thiemann discovered a remarkable rewriting of CL−CE in terms of Poisson brackets of VR with CE which he then used to construct  cid:3 CL − CE in terms of the commutator between ˆVR, ˆCE [10]. For simplicity we restrict attention in this Chapter to the construction of ˆCE. Let T   cid:4   be a one parameter family of triangulations of Σ with cells of coordinate size O  cid:4 3   in any ﬁxed coordinate atlas  so that in the  cid:4  → 0 ‘continuum’ limit, this triangulation becomes inﬁnitely ﬁne. To each such cell  cid:26 , associate the edges {si, i = 1, .., e cid:12 } and the loops {αJ , J = 1, .., L cid:12 }. Each such edge is of coordinate length O  cid:4   and each such loop of coordinate area O  cid:4 2 . Fix one point x cid:12  in each cell  cid:26 . A ﬁnite triangulation approximant CE,T   cid:10   N   which agrees with CE N    in the continuum limit is constructed as follows. Use equation  21  to re-express the triad part of equation  19 . Write the resulting expression for CE N   as a sum of integrals, one for each cell. Approximate each cell integral by approximating its integrand and multiplying the result by the coordinate measure  cid:4 3. Use holonomies along the edges and loops associated with each cell in equation  22  to construct the desired approximant to the integrand for each cell. It is straightforward to see that such a procedure yields an approximant CE,T   cid:10   N   of the form:   cid:8   e cid:4  cid:8   L cid:4  cid:8   N  x cid:12    CiJ T r  hαJ   cid:12  hsi  cid:12  {h  si  cid:12  , VR} . −1  i=1  J=1   cid:12 ∈T   cid:10    CE,T   cid:10  [N ] =   23  Here CiJ are numerical constants which depend on e cid:12 , L cid:12  but are otherwise inde- pendent of T   cid:4  . Note that all factors of  cid:4  have disappeared in this expression. In the next section, we shall see that this remarkable property follows from the unit density nature of CE. The action of the corresponding operator on some spin net- work state s cid:9  is obtained by replacing the classical functions in the above expression by their quantum correspondents and the Poisson brackets by commutators:  ˆCE,T   cid:10  [N ]s cid:9  = −i cid:2   N  x cid:12     cid:12 ∈T   cid:10    CiJ T r  ˆhαJ   cid:12    ˆhsi  cid:12  [ ˆh  si  cid:12  , ˆVR ]  s cid:9  −1   24  Next, note that since ˆVR only acts at vertices of spin nets, it follows that this action is trivial unless some of the edges si and loops αJ intersect some vertex of γ s .  e cid:4  cid:8   L cid:4  cid:8   i=1  J=1   cid:8    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 78  78  A. Laddha & M. Varadarajan  To ensure this, the triangulation T   cid:4   and the choices of these edges and loops are tailored to γ s  so that each vertex v of γ s  is contained in one  and only one  cell,  cid:26  v , and in this cell the edges and loops are based at this vertex. Denoting this choice of ‘graph adapted triangulation’ by T   cid:4 , γ s   and the vertex set of γ s  by V  γ s  , we obtain:  ˆCE,T   cid:10 ,γ s  [N ]s cid:9  =−i cid:2   CiJ T r ˆhαJ   cid:12    ˆhsi  cid:12  [ˆh  si  cid:12  , ˆVR] s cid:9  −1   cid:8   N  v    cid:12  v ∈T   cid:10 ,γ s    v∈V  γ s    e cid:4  cid:8   L cid:4  cid:8   i=1  J=1   25  where we have chosen x cid:12  = v for the cell  cid:26  v . Equation  25  has the structure of a sum over vertex contributions, each such contribution being multiplied by the evaluation of the lapse at the vertex in question. Motivated by the diﬀeomorphism covariance of CE  19 , Thiemann imposed certain restrictions on the choice of reg- ulating loops and edges which give rise to each of these vertex contributions. For our purposes the main consequence of these restrictions is as follows  for details see [8, 9] . For any vertex of γ s , the vertex contributions at two diﬀerent values of  cid:4  are diﬀeomorphic. We shall refer to this property as regulator covariance. Next, we focus on the question of how small  cid:4  should be for the action  25  to be deﬁned. One may think that this action is deﬁned for a ‘small enough  cid:4 ’ which necessarily depends on the graph γ s .e However, Thiemann was able to parameterize the one parameter family of triangulations T   cid:4 , γ s   in such a way that the regulator co- variant action  25  acquires a dependence which is uniform in  cid:4 . For our purposes here this uniformity property may be stated as follows. There exists ¯ cid:4  such that the action  25  is well deﬁned for all  cid:4  < ¯ cid:4  and such that the value of ¯ cid:4  is the same for all spin nets s cid:9 . We shall refer to this uniformity property of such covariant regu- lators as uniform regulator covariance. It follows from uniform regulator covariance that the action of an ‘ cid:4 -approximant’ Hamiltonian constraint on the ﬁnite span of spinnets, D, can be deﬁned by linear extension of  25  as:  ˆCE, cid:10 [N ]  aIsI cid:9  :=  aI ˆCE,T   cid:10 ,γ sI   [N ]sI cid:9    26   Next note that, as  cid:4  → 0, the action  26  does not converge within the kinematic Hilbert space because the deformed spinnets generated in equation  25  at diﬀerent values of  cid:4  live on diﬀerent graphs and are, therefore, mutually orthonormal. How- ever, uniform regulator covariance ensures that the evaluation of diﬀeomorphism invariant states on the right-hand side of  26  does converge in the continuum limit:  for any diﬀeomorphism invariant state Φ ∈ HDiﬀ and any ψ cid:9  ∈ D, we have that Φ  ˆCT   cid:10  [N ]ψ cid:9   is independent of  cid:4  because uniform regulator covariance implies eFor example, let this action be deﬁned for all  cid:3  <  cid:3 1 for s1 cid:6 . One may think that for a spin net s2 cid:6  such that γ s2  has a ‘high enough density’ of vertices in the neighborhood of a given vertex of γ s1 , the action  25  on s2 cid:6  must hold for a smaller range of  cid:3 . The loophole in this way of  thinking is that the notion of ‘high enough density’ is a background dependent one.  M cid:8   I=1  M cid:8   I=1   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 79  Quantum Dynamics  79   27   that the actions  26  at two diﬀerent values of  cid:4  are diﬀeomorphic. It follows that:  ˆCE, cid:10  N  ψ cid:9   = Φ  ˆCE, cid:10 0  N  ψ cid:9    Φ lim  cid:10 →0  where  cid:4 0 is any value of  cid:4  < ¯ cid:4 . An interpretation of the limit  27  was provided by Thiemann in terms of continuity with respect to a topology on the space of operators which preserve D as follows. The pair Φ ∈ HDiﬀ ,ψ cid:9  ∈ D deﬁnes a seminorm  ˆOΦ,ψ := Φ  ˆOψ cid:9   for any operator ˆO : D → D. Since such operators form a vector space, the family of seminorms  Φ,ψ ∀Φ,ψ cid:9  deﬁne a topology on  this space. It follows from  27  that in this operator topology by virtue of uniform regulator covariance, the one parameter family of  cid:4 -approximants ˆCE, cid:10  N   converge uniformly so that:  ˆCE, cid:10  N   = ˆCE, cid:10 0  N  .  lim  cid:10 →0   28   The above operator topology is called the Uniform Rovelli Smolin  URS  topology. It follows that the URS topology continuum limit constraint operator  28  is well deﬁned on the kinematic Hilbert space.f It turns out that the notion of convergence in this topology is powerful enough to enable a computation of the continuum limit of the commutator between a pair of ﬁnite triangulation constraints [10].  We may also attempt a deﬁnition of a continuum limit operator ˆCE N   through  the dual action of kinematic operators on HDiﬀ as follows: ˆCE, cid:10  N  ψ cid:9   = Φ  ˆCE, cid:10 0  N  ψ cid:9      ˆCE N    However the continuum limit of the dual action  29  does not preserve Hdif f due to  E, cid:10  N  Φ  ψ cid:9   := Φ lim †  cid:10 →0  Φ  ψ cid:9   := lim  cid:10 →0   29     ˆC  †  the presence of the c-number lapse N . It is then not clear how to compute the con- tinuum limit of the action of a second constraint on that of the ﬁrst. This precludes an analysis of their commutator. As discussed in Section 2.3, Lewandowski and Marolf deformed the space of diﬀeomorphism invariant states into their habitat to remedy this situation. This was done in a remarkably delicate manner to obtain the following properties:  a  the dual action of Thiemann’s ﬁnite triangulation Hamil- tonian constraint admits a well deﬁned  cid:4  → 0 limit on this habitat, and,  b  the dual action maps the habitat into itself so that the commutator can be computed. We now discuss the choice dependence of the continuum limit of the action of Thiemann’s constraint  the discussion is applicable to the URS as well as the habi- tat continuum limit . The deceptively simple treatment of the constraint, hides Thiemann’s ingenious uniform regulator covariant assignment of regulating edges and loops. Clearly, the ﬁnal operator action on a spin net depends on the diﬀeo- morphism invariant aspects of the placement of these loops and edges relative to the spin net graph as well as diﬀeomorphism invariant properties of the loops and edges themselves. A study of Thiemann’s work then reveals that, as may already  fNote however that the one parameter choice available for the value of  cid:3 0 implies that this limit is not unique; related to this is that the URS topology is not Hausdorﬀ.

Varadarajan  be obvious to the reader, there are, in general, inﬁnitely many diﬀeomorphically distinct ways in which to choose these edges and loops and their placements so that this deﬁnition of quantum dynamics is plagued by an inﬁnite ambiguity [9]. In addition, while equations  22  use the deﬁning j = 1 2 representation, in principle higher spin representations may also be used to obtain curvature and connection approximants [11]. It turns out that the LM habitat based continuum limit operator also suﬀers from exactly the same inﬁnite choice problems which occur for the limits  29  and  28  essentially due to the  partial  labeling of habitat states by diﬀeomorphism classes of spin nets  16 .  To summarize: While uniform regulator covariance seeks to promote the back- ground independence of LQG kinematics to its dynamics by making the regulating procedure as independent of background structures as possible, the continuum limit of the action still depends on an inﬁnitely manifold choice of background structures.  3.2. An Improved Strategy  We refer to the commutator between two Hamiltonian constraints  or a ﬁnite tri- angulation approximant to this commutator  as the LHS and the operator version of their Poisson bracket  20  as the RHS. As mentioned in Section 1, a strategy to reduce the vast choice in the deﬁnition of the Hamiltonian constraint is to demand that the continuum limit action of the commutator between two ﬁnite triangulation constraints is non-anomalous i.e. the  continuum limit of  LHS and RHS agree. Unfortunately, it turns out that for all the choices discussed in Section 3.1, the con- tinuum limit of the LHS and as well as the RHS vanish [9]. This ‘consistent trivial- ization’ manifests in the URS as well as the habitat continuum limit [3, 9, 10, 12]. Classically, the RHS is proportional to the diﬀeomorphism constraint, so that its vanishing in the URS continuum limit is expected. However, its vanishing on the habitat runs counter to intuition because the habitat states are not diﬀeomorphism invariant.  For this reason, as well as for concreteness, let us restrict attention to the habitat case. As we show now, the vanishing of the RHS is a direct consequence of working with unit density Hamiltonian constraints. Finite triangulation approximants to various local ﬁelds can be constructed from holonomies around  cid:4  length loops, ﬂuxes through  cid:4 2 size surfaces and volumes of  cid:4 3 size regions so that the following factors of  cid:4  are associated with the continuum objects below:  "ﬂux   cid:4 2  ∼  ˆEa i  "√ q ∼  cid:3 Volume   cid:4 3  ∼  cid:3 holonomy − 1  .  ˆF i ab   cid:4 2   30   Due to background independence, the action of the ﬂux, volume and holonomy operators on any state yields states which have Hilbert norm of order unity. We shall refer to such operators as ﬁnite operators to underline this order unity behavior. Equation  30  can be used to write any ﬁnite triangulation approximant in terms of powers of  cid:4  and ﬁnite operators. The reader may check that the above relations together with the replacement d3x ∼  cid:4 3 imply the expected cancellation of factors   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 81  Quantum Dynamics  81  of  cid:4  for the unit density Hamiltonian constraint  19 . It is straightforward to check that the RHS then has an overall factor of  cid:4 . The RHS can be ordered [8, 10] so as to also reduce to a  ﬁnite  sum of contributions, one for each vertex of the spin net. As a result the RHS can be expressed in the form  cid:4    cid:3 Finite  and the RHS vanishes in the continuum limit irrespective of the ﬁner details of the ﬁnite operator.  The trivialization of the RHS implies that the only reduction of ambiguity avail- able through the anomaly-free requirement is that the LHS also vanish. For the simplest set of choices of ﬁnite triangulation approximants, the new vertices created by the Hamiltonian constraint are such that the action of the second Hamiltonian constraint on them is trivial. As a consequence, the antisymmetric combination of the actions of two such constraints results in the vanishing of the LHS. This indi- cates that if there is a way to remove extra factors of  cid:4  in the RHS, then depending on the nature of the operator  cid:3 Finite, one may be able to get a nontrivial RHS but a vanishing LHS, thus ruling out such a choice. There are also other classes of choices [3] for which the LHS vanishes in the habitat calculation and, one may hope that a computation resulting in a rescaled RHS could render many of these choices anomalous and rule them out.g It turns out [8, 10] that the ﬁnite operator  cid:3 Finite acts as the diﬀerence between an  cid:4  size diﬀeomorphism and the identity, i.e.  cid:3 Finite ∼   ˆU  φ cid:10   − 1 . A rescaling of the RHS by  cid:4  −1 would then result in the oper- ator   ˆU  φ cid:10  − 1 . This operator maps the habitat weight function f  16  to the new function  φ cid:10 ∗f   − f which vanishes in the continuum limit. Comparing with the non-trivial operator action in equation  18 , it follows that this vanishing diﬀerence −1. This can be converted to a non-vanishing derivative with another factor of  cid:4  −2 which in turn corresponds motivates us to consider a rescaling of the RHS by  cid:4  −1 in the Hamiltonian constraint. From equation  30 , to one additional factor of  cid:4  this may be achieved by multiplying the constraint  19  by q 6 . Thus, the above dis- cussion motivates the consideration of a density weight 4 3 Hamiltonian constraint. −1 implies that at ﬁnite triangulation the constraint takes the The extra factor of  cid:4  form of a ﬁnite operator divided by  cid:4 , which would blow up in the URS topology continuum limit. However, if it were possible to code the action of the Hamiltonian constraint in terms of diﬀerences of small diﬀeomorphisms and the identity, then similar to equation  18  one may hope that the continuum limit action on some ap- propriate ‘habitat’ also yields a derivative of a weight function. This suggests that one should seek an interpretation of the transformations generated by the Hamilto- nian constraint in terms of diﬀeomorphisms. The existence of such an interpretation is hinted at by the following remarkable classical identity [13]:  1  {D[  cid:2 Ni], D[  cid:2 Mi]} =  2α−1 {CE,α N  , CE,α M  } =−  2α−1 {CL,α N  , CL,α M  }.  3 cid:8   i=1  Here N a i scripts indicate rescaling of the Euclidean and Lorentzian constraints by   31  i , the lapse N has density weight  2α − 1  and the α sub- q1−2α  −αN Ea  := q  √  gIndeed, an ad hoc ‘rescaling’ of the LHS and RHS by such factors points to such a conclusion [12].

This identity suggests that important i.e. CE,α = aspects of the action of the Hamiltonian constraint could perhaps be expressed in terms of phase space dependent diﬀeomorphisms.h To summarize: Our considera- tions above suggest that Thiemann’s choices could be improved by  a  the consider- ation of higher density weight constraints and their confrontation with the anomaly free requirement, and,  b  an attempt to express the action of the constraints in terms of  phase space dependent  diﬀeomorphisms.  3.3. Toy Models and the Form of Holonomy Approximants  Two useful toy models are that of Parameterized ﬁeld theory  PFT  [19] and the Husain-Kuchaˇr  HK  model [20]. PFT is free scalar ﬁeld theory on a ﬁxed ﬂat spacetime in diﬀeomorphism invariant disguise. In 1+1 dimensions, the free scalar ﬁeld splits into left and right moving modes. The PFT phase space also splits into left and right sets of variables and its dynamics is describable in terms of the action of two commuting sets of spatial diﬀeomorphisms, one for each set of variables. PFT dynamics is solvable in an LQG representation because, similar to Section 2, physical states can be constructed by group averaging over these two sets of transformations [4]. The question is whether it is possible to implement a Thiemann like construction of the PFT Hamiltonian constraint in such a way that its action annihilates the physical states constructed by group averaging methods. The answer is in the aﬃrmative. By choosing appropriate holonomy approximants, the ﬁnite triangulation constraint is constructed in terms of “small diﬀeomorphisms minus the identity” so that its action kills physical states. In order to obtain this form of the constraint, the representation labels of the holonomy approximants for PFT need to be adapted to the edge labels of the state being acted upon; this is in contrast to the standard choices in LQG wherein the representation of regulating holonomies is chosen once and for all [10, 11]. Some of the state labels in PFT are eigenvalues of ‘triad-like’ PFT operators thus indicating that PFT holonomy approximants depend on these PFT ‘triad’ operators! As discussed in Chapter 6, this general feature of the dependence of connection curvature approximants on the triad was anticipated already in the so-called Improved LQC Dynamics [5], wherein such a dependence is crucial for obtaining the correct long distance physics. Evidence for this general feature is also provided by a quantization of the HK model using Thiemann’s ﬁnite triangulation framework. The HK model is just  gravity without the Hamiltonian constraint so that its solutions reside in HDiﬀ of  Section 2.1. The question, similar to the PFT case, is whether the diﬀeomorphism constraint itself  rather than the unitaries for ﬁnite diﬀeomorphisms which ﬁgure in the group averaging map of Section 3.1  can be constructed as a continuum limit of ﬁnite triangulation approximants in such a way that the constraint operator  annihilates states in HDiﬀ . As shown in Ref. [21], the answer is in the aﬃrmative hNote that α = 1 2 corresponds to density weight one constraints and that the identity trivializes for this choice. We take this as further motivation to consider higher than unit density constraints.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 83  Quantum Dynamics  83  provided that the curvature approximants, once again, show  in this case, a very complicated  dependence on the triad.  In PFT one can also analyze the constraint algebra. Similar to the LQG Hamil- tonian constraint, the operator correspondent of the RHS for PFT trivializes for density weight one constraints due to the ‘overall factor of  cid:4 ’. A similar counting to that of the previous section indicates the use of density weight two constraints as a nontrivial probe of the PFT constraint algebra. Similar to the LQG case, −1. Nev- these constraints are kinematically singular due to an overall factor of  cid:4  ertheless, their continuum limit action is well deﬁned on an appropriate habitat of states corresponding to the product of a pair of ‘left moving’ and ‘right moving’ LM like habitats. The constraint algebra is represented non-trivially, without anomaly on this product habitat. Similar to the conversion of a trivial contribution into a −1 i.e. derivative  18 , the non-triviality of this representation is due to the factor of  cid:4  due to the kinematically singular property. Similar support for the consideration of such singular operators is exhibited in the ﬁnite triangulation construction of the diﬀeomorphism constraint [21] and a non-trivial  LM  habitat based representation of its constraint algebra.  In summary, the study of PFT, the HK model and LQC has been very useful both in providing support, as well as detailed inputs, to the strategy  a - b  outlined at the end of Section 3.2.  4. Euclidean Gravity: A Weak Coupling Limit  While useful, the toy models of the previous section suﬀer from the simpliﬁcation that their constraint algebras are Lie algebras. It is desirable to hone our ideas on a model whose constraint algebra has structure functions similar to the gravitational case. Just such a model was introduced by Laddha and its quantum constraint algebra studied in Refs. [14, 15]. Its 3+1 version is exactly Smolin’s novel weak coupling limit of Euclidean gravity [16]. This section is devoted to an application of the strategy suggested in Section 3.2 to a spin network based quantization of this model. We choose to focus on the 3+1 case below. Our treatment follows that of Refs.  [13, 17].  4.1. Classical Theory  !

Laddha & M. Varadarajan  −∂aAi  ab := ∂bAi a  b is the curvature of the Abelian connection Ai  where F i a and we have used a density weight 4 3 Hamiltonian constraint in accordance with the suggestion of Section 3.2. The constraint algebra is isomorphic to that of gravity. The structure functions appear as in gravity in the Poisson bracket between a pair of Hamiltonian constraints. When the Gauss Law is satisﬁed this Poisson bracket evaluates to:  {C[N ], C[M ]} = D[ cid:2 ω],  ωa := q  − 2  3 Ea  i Eb  i  M ∂bN − N ∂bM   ,   33   where the electric ﬁeld dependence of the structure function ωa is exactly that of gravity.  Motivated by the fact that the identity  31  holds for the U  1 3 theory as well, we seek to code the action of the Hamiltonian constraint in terms of phase space dependent diﬀeomorphisms. Additional motivation is provided by the following classical identity which holds for any vector ﬁeld N a and any U  1 3 connection Ai a:  Applied to the Hamiltonian constraint C N   together with a by-parts integration, it is easy to check that when the Gauss Law is satisﬁed, we obtain:  N aF i  b + ∂bλi,  λi := Ai  aN a.  ab = L  cid:7 N Ai  cid:5    cid:5   C N   = 1 2   cid:4 ijkN a  i F k  abEb  j = 1 2   cid:4 ijk L  cid:7 Ni  Ak  b  Eb j ,  where the triple of ‘electric shift vector ﬁelds’ N a  i , i = 1, 2, 3 is deﬁned as  N a i  := N q  3 Ea i ,  − 1  4.2. Quantum Kinematics  The Hilbert space is spanned by orthonormal U  1 3 ‘charge’ network states. Similar to the SU  2  case of LQG, each such state c cid:9  ≡ γ,{ cid:2 qI} cid:9  is labelled by a closed graph γ whose oriented edges eI are colored by representation labels of U  1 3 i.e. I , i = 1, 2, 3  ≡  cid:2 qI . Charge net states can be by a triplet of integer valued charges  qi  cid:8  thought of as wave functions in a connection representation so that c cid:9  ≡ c A ,  3 cid:17    cid:5   c A  :=  exp i  k=1  I  qk I  Ak  adxa.  eI  δAi a  ∼ −i cid:2  δ  U  1 3 holonomy operators act on c A  by multiplication and electric ﬁelds by dif- ferentiation, ˆEa . It is then easy to check that  a  charge network states i are invariant under U  1 3 gauge transformations only if the sum of charges at each vertex vanishes,  b  that charge net states are eigenvectors of the electric ﬁeld op- erator valued distribution, and,  c  that  b  implies that the operator ˆEi S  which measures the electric ﬂux through the surface S is also diagonalized, its eigenvalues being computed by visualizing each such state as electric lines of force along the edges of the graph, each edge carrying ﬂux  cid:2 qI so that the integer valued eigenvalue is just the total ﬂux through the surface S.   34    35    36    37    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 85  Quantum Dynamics  85   cid:5   "  − 1  4.3. Finite Triangulation Constraint Operators: Motivational  Heuristics and Final Expressions  We shall not worry about overall factors of constants and  cid:2  below.

Fortunately, the fact that charge net states diagonalize the electric ﬁeld operator implies that with a suitable choice of operator  of the symbol L  cid:7 Ni  ordering, we may replace the electric shift operator  ˆ cid:2 N i x  by its eigenvalue:  ˆN a  i  x  c A  := N ˆEa  i  q  3  x  c A  =: N a  i  x  c A .   39    40    cid:8   The eigenvalue N a i  x  is referred to as the quantum shift. It can be non-vanishing only when x lies on a vertex v of the charge net because, as in LQG, inverse powers of ˆq when regularized can act non-trivially only at vertices. The detailed computation [13] of the quantum shift involves the use of a regulating coordinate patch in the neighborhood of v. The ﬁnal result is that N a i  x = v  takes the form  i  v  ∼ N  v  N a " 3 and is constructed out of the { cid:2 qIv − 1  ˆea Iv qi  I λv.  Iv  q  } [13]. Here λv comes from the action of Vertices for which λv  cid:10 = 0 are called non-degenerate vertices and those for which λv = 0 are called degenerate. Clearly, the quantum shift vanishes on degenerate vertices. The ˆea Iv terms in  40  come from the action of the electric ﬁeld operator through functional diﬀerentiation of c A  at the vertex v, with  cid:2 ˆeIv denoting the Ivth edge tangent at v.  Iv qi  We note that the quantum shift inherits a coordinate dependence in two ways. First, the lapse, being a density weighted object, requires a coordinate patch for its evaluation; consequently N  v  is evaluated in the regulating coordinate patch. Second the edge tangents are of unit coordinate norm in the regulating coordinates. We shall return to a discussion of the coordinate dependence of N a i  v  when we discuss the issue of diﬀeomorphism covariance in Section 4.5. Let us return to equation  38  and use  40  therein to obtain:   cid:5    cid:8    cid:8   ˆC N   c A  ∼   cid:4 jk i  Σ  λv  v  Iv  N  v qi  Iv  L cid:7 ˆeIv  Ak b    δ δAj b  c A    41   Similar arguments may be applied to the U  1 3 electric diﬀeomorphism con- straint D   cid:2 Ni  := j which, modulo the Gauss Law reduces to D[  cid:2 Ni] =  i F j  abEb  Σ N a      February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 86  86     A.

Next, note that for reasons discussed in Section 1, we need to replace the above expressions with ﬁnite triangulation approximants. The ﬁnal expressions  43 ,  44  are complicated and instead of deriving them in detail, we motivate their form through the argumentation below. Unfortunately, we are obliged to omit some important steps in our arguments below due to space limitations and we urge the reader to consult [13] for a comprehensive account.  We replace the action of the Lie derivative with respect to the quantum shift with the diﬀerence of a δ-sized ‘diﬀeomorphism’ minus the identity. If the quantum shift was a smooth vector ﬁeld like its classical counterpart, there would be no need to use the inverted commas around ‘diﬀeomorphism’. However, since the quantum shift abruptly vanishes except at v, it is not a smooth vector ﬁeld and one needs to endow the δ sized ﬁnite triangulation approximant associated with the symbol L cid:7 ˆeIv in equations  41 ,  42  with some operational meaning in quantum theory. This is where we make a jump from  heuristic  logic to intuition. We visualize the deformation generated by each edge tangent  cid:2 ˆeIv as pulling the vertex v and its immediate neighborhood in the direction  cid:2 ˆeIv to leading order in δ. In the case of equation  42 , the deformation is akin to a ‘singular’ diﬀeomorphism. The vertex v is displaced by a coordinate distance ∼ δ to its deformed image v  cid:3  I and all the edges eJv , Jv  cid:10 = Iv are scrunched close together in a direction opposite to that of the Ivth one to leading order in δ. Thus, in the deformed charge net, the old vertex  cid:3  v is replaced by v I , and the charges on the deformed edges are the same as those on their undeformed counterparts.  In the case of equation  41 , since the triplet of U  1  connections all live on the same graph, the deformed structure of the graph is the same. However due to the factor of  cid:4 ijk, two of the three charges on each edge are ‘ﬂipped’ [13]. Charge conservation due to gauge invariance then requires that the deformed graph also contain segments of the undeformed edges as well as the original vertex v. Deforma- tions generated by the actions  41 ,  42  are depicted in Figure 1. Note that these actions  41 ,  42  do not obtain a contribution from degenerate vertices so that the sum over vertices therein is restricted to non-degenerate vertices. Due to the particular nature of the ﬂipping, it turns out that when the Hamiltonian constraint acts at a non-degenerate vertex v of the undeformed charge net c cid:9 , it converts v to a degenerate vertex of the deformed charge network; in addition, the deformed vertex is expected to be non-degenerate  see footnote 17 of [13] for more discussion on this .

In the case of ˆC N  , the dashed edges are only charged in two of the three U  1  factors, but v cid:3  I is expected to be, generically, non-degenerate. With respect to the coordinate system ﬁxed at v, v cid:3  I is located a distance δ from v along eI and displaced oﬀ of eI at a distance O δ2 . All of the ˜eJJ  cid:7 = I have tangents at v cid:3  I which are bunched. The C0, C 1 labels refer to the diﬀerentiability degree at which the ˜eK meet eK at ˜vK . [13].  To summarize: Our arguments indicate that the action of the Hamiltonian con- straint can be coded in terms of phase space dependent diﬀeomorphisms through the use of equation  35 . Its action on a charge network state is represented as a combination of ‘singular’ diﬀeomorphisms and ‘charge ﬂips’.  In order to give a ﬂavor of the detailed expressions, we display the action of the ﬁnite triangulation Hamiltonian constraint ˆCδ N   and the electric diﬀeomorphism constraint   cid:3  Dδ   cid:2 Ni :  ˆCδ[N ] c A  =  N  x v  λv  qi Iv  1 δ  Iv ,δ  − c  cid:3   c i, v   43    cid:8    cid:2   2i  3 4π  v∈V  c   The various quantiﬁers {Iv, i, δ} in the argument of c specify the particular edge eIv emanating from v along which the deformation  of magnitude ∼ δ  was performed, and the particular ﬂipping of the charges via internal rotation about the ith axis.   cid:7    cid:7   ˆDδ[  cid:2 Ni] c =   cid:2   i  3 4π  N  x v  λv  qi Iv  1 δ  Iv ,δ  − c  cid:3   c v   44    cid:8   Iv ,i   cid:8   Iv   cid:6    cid:6    cid:8   v  Since there is no charge ﬂipping in the action of ˆDδ[  cid:2 Ni], the deformed charge net is speciﬁed only by Iv, δ.  4.4. Anomaly Free Continuum Limit  Recall from Section 3.3 that the quantizations of the HK model and PFT carry a non-trivial representation of the constraint algebra. Accordingly, our considera- tions below derive their motivation from the treatment of these toy models [4, 21].   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 88  88  A. Laddha & M. Varadarajan  Ideally, we would like to now deﬁne continuum limits of operators on a suitable habitat similar to the case of the LM habitat for the HK model. This requires that the continuum limit Hamiltonian constraint maps the habitat to itself through its dual continuum action  see equation  29  and the related discussion . In the case of the HK model habitat states are slight deformations of the solution space of diﬀeomorphism states, the deformations being parameterized by vertex smooth functions f  see equation  16  and the related discussion . This structure of the habitat as a deformation of the solution space by vertex smooth functions persists in the case of PFT as well. In the U  1 3 model we cannot build a putative habitat in this way because we do not have access to the space of solutions to the constraints.i Our task is, therefore, to construct ab initio a habitat with respect to which the continuum limit action of the commutator is non-trivial and anomaly free, given the ﬁnite triangulation operators  43 ,  44  and the identity  31 . This is a very diﬃcult object to achieve and as we shall see shortly, while we do obtain an anomaly free continuum limit using a certain set of states in the algebraic dual which are parameterized by vertex smooth functions, the continuum limit is not one of dual action. Instead it is an operator topology based limit similar to the URS continuum limit except that the role of diﬀeomorphism invariant states there  see discussion after equation  27   is played by the states in the algebraic dual mentioned in the previous sentence. Since these states lie in the algebraic dual and are parameterized by vertex smooth functions, we shall call these states as Vertex Smooth Algebraic  states  VSA states  and the ﬁnite span of these states as DV SA. The VSA states  are constructed as  uncountable  sums of charge nets weighted by vertex smooth functions. Just as in  16 , each LM habitat state is obtained by summing over all diﬀeomorphic images of some charge net c cid:9 , each VSA state is obtained by summing over certain deformations, to be speciﬁed below, of a suitably chosen ‘primordial’ charge net. We shall refer to the elements of the set of such deformed charge nets V SA is the VSA  associated with the primordial charge net c0 cid:9  by Bc0 analog of [c] in the LM case.j  V SA so that Bc0   cid:8   Ψf B  c0 VSA  :=  ¯c∈B  c0 VSA  κ¯cf  V  ¯c   cid:8 ¯c   45   Here V  ¯c  is the set of non-degenerate vertices of ¯ck and κ¯c is speciﬁed below.

Therefore the best we can do is ensure that the space DV SA  to be deﬁned shortly  does contain ‘vertex smooth’ deformations of diﬀeomorphism invariant states. jReference [13] inadvertently omitted the superscript label c0. kStrictly speaking the vertices in question are not necessarily non-degenerate; their exact speciﬁ- cation is given in Footnote 17 of Ref. [13], the important point being that Hamiltonian and electric diﬀeomorphism deformations conserve the number of vertices so speciﬁed.

Our task is then to choose Bc0 V SA such that we obtain LHS and RHS continuum limits which agree with each other i.e. such that the evaluations  46  and  47  agree , c cid:9 . If these limits vanish for every such pair, we would have no for all pairs Ψf B manifest inconsistency. However, the underlying reason for such a putative consis- tent trivialization would presumably have more to do with an inappropriate choice  of DV SA; inappropriate in the sense that this choice would not probe features of the  c0 VSA  action of the Hamiltonian constraint in enough detail to obtain non-trivial results. This, in turn, would dilute the restrictiveness of the anomaly free requirement in the choice of ﬁnite triangulation approximants to the constraints.

To ensure  a  and  b , it is clear that we need to be able to infer all the possible ‘parents’ of any double Hamiltonian and any double electric diﬀeomorphism child; if we can do this, the set of all double Hamiltonian and double electric diﬀeomorphism children of these parents will comprise Bc0 V SA. As shown in Ref. [13] this can indeed be done  with the parents themselves arising from certain operations on the primor- dial state c0 cid:9   by a careful study of a certain notion of ‘causal structure’ associated with the deformed oﬀspring and a careful choice of the primordial charge net c0 cid:9 . In [13], Bc0 V SA is chosen such that its elements have a single relevant vertex so that the vertex smooth functions have a single argument. With this choice of Bc0 V SA the limits  46  and  47  can be evaluated. Whenever non-trivial, they agree,m in which case their evaluation is:   qi  Iv  2λvλvIv ˆea  Iv ˆeb  Iv  N  x v  ∂aM  x v   − M ↔ N   ∂bf  v ,   cid:24   2   cid:2   2i  3 4π   cid:25 2  cid:8    cid:8   v∈V  c   Iv ,i   48  where λvIv is evaluated at the Ivth deformed vertex  see [13] . This demonstrates the existence of a non-trivial anomaly free continuum limit action of the Hamilto-  mAs shown in [13] κ¯c in equation  45  needs to be chosen to be unity for those charge net labels ¯c which describe double Hamiltonian oﬀspring and − 1 12 for double electric diﬀeomorphism oﬀspring.

[13], one expects the existence of an inﬁnite family of possible ‘single relevant  vertex’ primordial states c0 cid:9  and thereby a large family of VSA states. More-  over, while multi-vertex primordial states have not been explicitly constructed in Ref. [13], we do not anticipate any obstructions to their construction.  4.5. Diﬀeomorphism Covariance  While the considerations of the previous section yield an anomaly free continuum limit of the commutator of the Hamiltonian constraint with itself, it is also necessary that these considerations yield anomaly free continuum limits for the remaining constraint commutators. It turns out that  see Footnote i  Bc0 V SA is closed under the action of diﬀeomorphisms and that the distributions DV SA are deformations  of diﬀeomorphism invariant elements in the algebraic dual space [13]. Therefore, similar to the case of the LM habitat, the algebra of diﬀeomorphism constraints is anomaly free and as an immediate consequence so is the VSA continuum limit of the commutator between a pair of diﬀeomorphism constraints. Related to this we note that  a  motivated by Thiemann’s considerations of regulator covariance, Ref. [13] constructs the action of the ﬁnite triangulation operators ˆCδ N  , ˆDδ   cid:2 Ni  so as to have the property that the ﬁnite triangulation operator actions at δ = δ1 and δ = δ2 are images of each other by a diﬀeomorphism and  b  that this property nicely dovetails with the ‘deformation of diﬀeomorphism invariance’ property of elements of DV SA. {C N  , D   cid:2 M  } = C L  cid:7 M N  . Equivalently, under the action of any diﬀeomorphism φ generated by the diﬀeomorphism constraints, the Hamiltonian constraint C N   is mapped to C φ∗ N    which translates to the condition ˆU  φ  ˆC N   ˆU  φ  = ˆC φ∗N  . Since ˆC N   is deﬁned through the VSA continuum limit, we interpret this condition in terms of VSA continuum limits as:  The Poisson bracket between the Hamiltonian and diﬀeomorphism constraints is  †  ˆU  φ  ˆCδ N   ˆU  lim δ→0   φ  = lim δ→0  ˆCδ φ∗N  .  †   49   We refer to  49  as the condition of diﬀeomorphism covariance. Not surprisingly, the arbitrary choice of regulating coordinating patches for the evaluation of the quantum shift  see equation  39  and subsequent discussion , leads to the viola- tion of this condition, the main culprit being the necessarily coordinate dependent evaluation of the density weighted lapse together with the fact that choice of the co- ordinate patch associated with a vertex v of c cid:9  and the one associated with φ v  of  cid:3  cid:9  := ˆU  φ c cid:9  have, in general nothing to do with each other. This suggests that if c we choose the coordinate patch {x}c,v associated with the former, we should ‘move’ this coordinate patch by φ so as to choose φ∗{x}c,v for the latter. The problem with this is that there are many diﬀeomorphisms which map c cid:9  to c  cid:3  cid:9  due to the 1 dimensional nature of the charge net graph. Remarkably, as shown in Ref. [17], by mildly restricting the vertex structure of charge nets in Bc0 V SA to satisfy a certain   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 92  92  A. Laddha & M. Varadarajan  ‘non-degeneracy’ property [17, 18], this problem can be alleviated and equation  49  then holds. [17]. However, this choice of ‘diﬀeomorphism covariant’ deformations generated by the action of a single Hamiltonian constraint leads to a divergent continuum limit for the commutator between a pair of Hamiltonian constraints. To see this recall that deformations generated by the Hamiltonian constraint at diﬀerent values of δ are related by diﬀeomorphisms. Diﬀeomorphism covariance implicates the use of coordinate patches related by such diﬀeomorphisms. In the commutator the second constraint acts on deformations created by the ﬁrst. As δ → 0, coordinate patches associated with these deformations become sick because the diﬀeomorphism scrunches edges into collinearity. This leads to a divergence of the commutator. The commutator continuum limit can then be rendered ﬁnite by enlarging the dependence of the vertex smooth functions to additional vertices of the charge net and specifying a certain benign ‘short distance’ behavior of the ver- tex smooth functions [13]. However, it then turns out that this continuum limit is not necessarily anomaly free. This happens because, roughly speaking, the require- ment of diﬀeomorphism covariance acts as a ‘magnifying glass’ for diﬀeomorphically related deformations; as a result the continuum limit becomes extremely sensitive to the speciﬁcation of the deformation at ﬁnite triangulation. It then turns out that by further specifying the deformations to be conical in a certain sense [17], the continuum limit of the commutator  46  is rendered anomaly free.  The ﬁnal result, then is that the VSA continuum limit of the commutators be- tween a pair of diﬀeomorphism constraints, between the diﬀeomorphism constraint and the Hamiltonian constraint, and between a pair of Hamiltonian constraints is well deﬁned and anomaly free. Equation  48  is then replaced by the expression [17]:   cid:25 2   cid:24  !  2i   cid:2   3 4π  Jv cid:7 =Iv  !   cid:8   Iv  λvf2 v, .., v   {N  x v  ˆea  Kv cid:7 =Iv gab ˆea Kv 4 M − 1 gab ˆea  − ˆea Jv   ˆeb Iv ˆeb Iv    Kv  Iv ∂aM  x v   −  N ↔ M  } − ˆeb  $ 1  3  Jv    2λvIv cos2 θIv0 2   cid:8   i   qi  Iv  2ˆea  Iv ∂ag v .   50   We have reproduced the expression above from Ref. [17] to give a ﬂavor of the complexity of the ﬁnal result. An explanation of the various symbols appearing in this expression is out of the scope of the paper and we invite the interested reader to consult [17] for details.  5. Hamiltonian Constraint in Euclidean Gravity  In the previous section we showed how the weak coupling limit of Euclidean gravity could be quantized within the framework of LQG and led to a generally covariant quantum ﬁeld theory in a precise sense. The key question is if the lessons learnt from analysis of U  1 3 theory and other toy models described above could be applied to   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 93  Quantum Dynamics  93  the SU  2  theory itself and if one could obtain an anomaly free deﬁnition of the Hamiltonian constraint.  As we saw one of the key lessons that we learnt so far was the importance of a geometric interpretation of the Hamiltonian constraint. This interpretation was the key input in the choice of ﬁnite triangulation constraint. For Euclidean gravity in connection variables, a rather straightforward computation shows that  a x τi} = 2[τi, LN ˜EiAa x ] + 2[τi,DaΛ i  x ]   51     {H[N ], Ai as Λ i  x  = −N ˜Ea  where H[N ] =  N Tr F ∧ E ∧ E .  τi are the Pauli matrices and Λ i  x  are a triplet of gauge parameters deﬁned i Aa x . That is, the action of the Hamiltonian constraint on the Ashtekar-Barbero connection can be understood in terms of a concomitant of phase space dependent diﬀeomorphism, a phase space dependent gauge transfor- mation and an adjoint action by a ﬁxed element of su 2 . The robustness of this interpretation came from a non-trivial observation by Ashtekar [22] who showed that precisely the same interpretation also held for action of H[N ] on densitized triads.  {H[N ], ˜Ea  i  x τ i} = [τi, LN ˜Ei  ˜Ea x ] + [τi,Rλ i   ˜E]   52   R is the  inﬁnitesimal  SU  2  rotation of the triad.  The choice of ﬁnite triangulation constraint should be such that its action of spin-network states of the theory precisely captures the geometric action of classical constraint on the classical ﬁelds. A proposal for the Hamiltonian constraint based on these ideas is given in [23], where some preliminary evidence was presented in the favor of its oﬀ-shell anomaly freedom. We thus believe that the goal of deﬁning quantum dynamics for Euclidean Loop Quantum Gravity which passes one of the key consistency checks of anomaly freedom is on the horizon.  6. Conclusions  In our view, the outstanding problem in LQG is a satisfactory deﬁnition of its quan- tum dynamics generated by the Hamiltonian constraint ˆC N  . The tension between the local nature of the ﬁelds comprising C N   and the non-locality of some of the basic operators of the theory necessitates the approximation of the former in terms of the latter thus yielding an approximant to ˆC N  . It is then necessary to deﬁne ˆC N   through a limiting procedure of better and better approximants, the operator ˆC N   arising as a continuum limit of its approximants in a suitable topology. Note that the approximant operators ˆCδ N   are deﬁned on the continuum kinematic Hilbert space of the theory; while the ‘regulating’ structures  namely the triangu- lations Tδ of the manifold  become ﬁner, this Hilbert space is unchanged. This is a crucial diﬀerence with Lattice Gauge Theory regularizations in which the Hilbert space itself lives on the lattice and the continuum limit involves an ever ﬁner trian- gulation structure  namely the lattice  and its associated Hilbert space. It is this   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 94  94  A. Laddha & M. Varadarajan  feature which makes the LQG treatment very dependent on the ﬁnite triangulation choices. In this Chapter we reviewed recent attempts to constrain these choices by imposing the condition that the quantum theory encode the most robust and beauti- ful property of general relativity, namely its general covariance, which via the HKT analysis [1] lies in the structure of its classical constraint algebra. These attempts are based on the key insight that the action of the Hamiltonian constraint, which generates temporal deformations of the Cauchy slice can be understood in terms of the action of triad dependent spatial diﬀeomorphisms [13, 14, 22, 23]. While the results are encouraging  see also [24] , there is still much to do. One lesson learnt [17] is that the more one  legitimately  demands from the theory, the more are the choices constrained. There is yet much to demand from the attempted constructions of ˆC N  .  Chief amongst these demands is that the algebra generated by the continuum constraints be represented on a representation space i.e. a suitable habitat. This implies that the action of any ﬁnite string of constraint operators be well deﬁned. In contrast the current state of the art for the Hamiltonian constraintn only constructs the continuum limit action of a single such constraint and the continuum limit action of its commutator; it does not yet construct the continuum limit action of the product of two constraints i.e. it constructs limδ→0 limδ→0  ˆCδ N   ˆCδ cid:2   M  −M ↔ N   as opposed to  limδ→0 limδ cid:2 →0 ˆCδ N   ˆCδ cid:2  M    −  limδ→0 limδ cid:2 →0 M ↔ N  . The requirement of a genuine representation of the entire constraint algebra generated by the basic Poisson brackets between the constraints is far more stringent than that of an anomaly free continuum limit only of the basic commutators.  Yet another demand, based on physical intuition, is of a resolution between a conceptual tension between the extremely ‘local’ deformations generated by the Hamiltonian constraint and the propagating deformations of classical spacetime cor- responding to gravitational waves [25]. Since the solutions of classical PFT describe the propagation of scalar waves, 1+1 PFT once again provides an invaluable testing ground to probe and resolve this tension and thereby further constrain improve the available choices in deﬁning a quantum dynamics for LQG [26]. Yet another demand is one of local Lorentz invariance in the quantum dynamics; unfortunately, we do not even have a clear articulation of this demand in the context of the underlying discreteness of LQG.  There exist other exciting lines of thought towards a deﬁnition of the quantum dynamics for LQG [27–33]. We mention two examples. In [30], the authors seek a quantization of the Hamiltonian constraint in 3-dimensional gravity which leads to the well known equations of Ponzano-Regge model. They show that such a quan- tum constraint indeed does exist, whose kernel matches the well studied solutions of Ponzano-Regge theory. This proposal has also been extended to four dimen- sions [31] and it would be of interest to see if there is any overlap with the material  nWhile the LM habitat supports a representation of the constraint algebra with density 1 Hamil- tonian constraints, the representation trivializes in the sense described in Section 1.

The recent work [32] also uses a ‘spin foam-Regge cal- culus’ inspired line of thought to directly construct an operator corresponding to the spatial curvature. Since the diﬀerence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian Hamiltonian constraints can also be encoded in the spatial curvature, this oﬀers an alternative to the Thiemann trick described in Section 3.  In conclusion, we hope to have convinced the reader that the question of the existence of a satisfactory deﬁnition of the quantum dynamics of LQG can be con- fronted with a rich family of ideas and strategies and that there is room for optimism for a resolution of this question in the foreseeable future.

Introduction  Spins in quantum mechanics and the action of general relativity share a simple and surprising relation. This relation is at the roots of spinfoam gravity [1, 2]. The Wigner 6j symbol is an elementary object that appears in the theory of ‘composition of angular momenta’ in quantum mechanics. It is the simplest non-trivial invariant under rotations that can be built from Clebsch–Gordan coeﬃcients only [3]. It turns out that this familiar quantity is related to the action of general relativity in  3 spacetime dimensions. In the limit of large spins ji  cid:28  1, the following asymptotic formula holds [4]  cid:18    cid:19   j1 j2 j3 j4 j5 j6  √−48π i V ≈  8πGN  cid:2  3 2  e + i   cid:2  S + c.c. .   cid:5    cid:5   Here S is a function obtained from the 3-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action for a compact region R  IR[gμν] =  1  16πGN  R  √  d3x  gR +  √ hK  d2x  1  8πGN  ∂R  as follows: the action is evaluated on the ﬂat Euclidean metric, S = IR[ημν], and the region R is chosen so that its induced geometry is the one of a ﬂat Euclidean tetrahedron. Under these conditions, the Einstein-Hilbert action determines the building-block of the so-called Regge action S [5, 6]. S depends only on a ﬁnite number of variables, speciﬁcally the lengths  cid:9 1, . . . ,  cid:9 6 of the six edges of the tetrahe- g in  1  is the volume of the tetrahedron expressed dron. The quantity V = as a function of the edge-lengths.

Figure 1 shows how accurate formula  This surprising relation discovered by Ponzano and Regge in 1968 provides the simplest and oldest example of spinfoam model for quantum gravity, a realization of the path-integral over spacetime geometries [7, 8]  Z =  Dgμν e  i  cid:2  S[gμν]  in terms of a sum over spins. The analogous quantity for Lorentzian General Rel- ativity in 4 spacetime dimensions has long been searched [9–30] and found only in 2007 [31–34].  Formally, the path integral over spacetime geometries with an initial and a ﬁnal  boundary  W [q 1   ab , q 2   ab ] =   1  ab ,q   2  ab  q  Dgμν e  i  cid:2  S[gμν]  is a solution of Hamiltonian constraint equation ˆC Ψ[qab] = 0, i.e. a physical state  in canonical quantum gravity. It turns out that the boundary space of states in spinfoam gravity coincides with the Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity discussed in Chapters 1 and 2. As a result the spinfoam path integral provides a covariant tool to solve the Hamiltonian. In fact spinfoam gravity can be understood as the covariant formulation of canonical loop quantum gravity as originally proposed by Reisenberger and Rovelli in 1996 [9].

We restrict attention to the case of vanish- ing cosmological constant Λ = 0. The generalization to Λ  cid:10 = 0 has been derived recently [35–38].  Throughout this chapter we set  cid:2  = 1 and keep Newton’s constant GN explicit.  2. Topological Field Theory and Gravity  Topological ﬁeld theories are ﬁeld theories with no local degree of freedom: the only dynamical degrees of freedom have a global nature and capture the topological invariants of the manifold the theory is deﬁned on [39–41]. These theories share with general relativity the invariance under diﬀeomorphisms and provide a classical starting point for the formulation of spinfoam gravity. Consider a 4-dimensional manifold with topology M = M×R with M a compact 3-manifold. A topological ﬁeld theory of the BF type with the Lorentz group SO 1, 3  as gauge group is deﬁned by the action [15]   cid:5   Stop[B, ω] =  BIJ ∧ F IJ .  M   6    7    8   μ  x dxμ is a Lorentz connection, F IJ = dωIJ + ωI  K ∧ ωKJ its Here ωIJ = ωIJ μν  x  dxμ ∧ dxν a two-form with values in the adjoint repre- curvature and BIJ = BIJ sentation of Lorentz group. We also denote ηIJ the Minkowski metric with signature  − + ++  and  cid:4 IJKL the Levi-Civita tensor,  cid:4 0123 = +1. The theory described by the action  6  is manifestly invariant under diﬀeomorphisms Diﬀ M  and under local Lorentz transformations. The action Stop has also another local symmetry, topological invariance: the action is invariant under shifts of the B ﬁeld by the covariant derivative of a one-form ΛIJ ,  BIJ → BIJ + dΛIJ + ωI  K ∧ ΛKJ + ωJ  K ∧ ΛKI ,  as can be shown by integration by parts and using the Bianchi identity dF IJ + K ∧ F KJ = 0. Requiring the stationarity of the action with respect to variations ωI δB and δω we ﬁnd that the classical solutions satisfy the equations of motion  F = 0  and dBIJ + ωI  K ∧ BKJ + ωJ  K ∧ BKI = 0 .  The ﬁrst equation tells us that the Lorentz connection ω is locally ﬂat, and therefore locally can be written as a pure gauge conﬁguration. The second equation  together with the shift symmetry equation  7  and the fact that locally all closed forms are exact  tells us that the B ﬁeld can be written locally as BIJ = dΛIJ + ωI ωJ ﬁeld equations are equal modulo gauge transformations and shifts: the theory has no local degrees of freedom.  K ∧ ΛKJ + K ∧ ΛKI for some 1-form ΛIJ . Therefore locally, all solutions of the BF theory  General relativity can be formulated in the same language as the theory de- scribed above. The coupling of gravity to fermionic matter ﬁelds is best described via the introduction of the Lorentz group SO 1, 3  as internal gauge group.

Bianchi  fundamental variables of the theory are the Lorentz connection ωIJ = ωIJ and a coframe ﬁeld eI = eI given by gμν x  = ηIJ eI obtained from the ﬁrst order action for gravity [42, 43]  μ  x dxμ μ x dxμ. The spacetime metric is a derived quantity ν  x . Einstein equations are the equations of motion  μ x eJ  Sgrav[e, ω] =  1  16πGN  M   cid:4 IJKLeI ∧ eJ ∧ F KL − 1 γ  1 2  eI ∧ eJ ∧ F KL ,   9    cid:5   plus the action of matter Smat[ψ, e, ω]. The theory is invariant under diﬀeomor- phisms Diﬀ M  and under local Lorentz transformations as for the action in equa- tion  6 . The diﬀerence is that now there is no analogue of the shift symmetry equation  7 : the theory has inﬁnitely many dynamical degrees of freedom, two per point, and the equations of motion are non trivial,   cid:4 IJKL eJ ∧ F KL = 0  and eI ∧  deJ + ωJ  K ∧ eK  = 0 .   10    cid:3    cid:4   J ∧ eJ . Note that the second term in the  The ﬁrst equation is the Einstein equation for pure gravity and the second the vanishing of the torsion T I = deI + ωI action equation  9  does not aﬀect the classical equations of motion. The coupling constant γ is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter [44, 45] appearing in the canonical formulation of general relativity in real Ashtekar variables [46, 47]  see Chapter 1 . The topological theory deﬁned by equation  6  can be understood as general relativity with all its degrees of freedom frozen so that the Lorentz connection is ﬂat, F = 0. In general relativity this solution has the physical interpretation of a Minkowski spacetime. By identifying the B ﬁeld with the exterior product of two cotetrads as suggested by the relation between the actions  6  and  9 , i.e. by setting  BIJ =  1  16πGN  1 2  KL eK ∧ eL − 1   cid:4 IJ   11    12    cid:4   we generate also a solution of the topological theory. For instance by choosing the gauge such that eI = dxI and ωIJ = 0, we have BIJ = 1 γ dxI ∧ dxJ  that solves equation  8 . However, because of the symmetry  7 , the physical interpretation of this solution is now rather diﬀerent. This is most easily shown by considering the 4-volume of a spacetime region  KL dxK ∧dxL−  2  cid:4 IJ  16πGN  1  1  V = −   cid:4 IJKLeI ∧ eJ ∧ eK ∧ eL .  1 4!  By inverting  11  we ﬁnd  eI ∧ eJ = −16πGN  γ2   13  and upon substitution in V, equation  12  gives us the spacetime volume expressed in terms of the B ﬁeld. However B ﬁelds that diﬀer by a covariant derivative are physically equivalent because of the topological symmetry  7 . Therefore in  1 + γ2  ,  KL BKL +  BIJ   cid:4 IJ  1 γ   cid:3   1 2   cid:4    cid:4   ,  γ  eI ∧ eJ  cid:3    cid:3    cid:5    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 101  Spinfoam Gravity  101  the topological theory diﬀerent volumes, and more generally diﬀerent spacetime geometries determined by B, are identiﬁed.  Conversely, general relativity can be formulated in terms of the topological the- ory  6  with the addition of a constraint on the B ﬁeld that breaks the symmetry  7  and unfreezes the degrees of freedom of the Lorentz connection. The requirement is that there exist a one-form eI such that B has the form  11 . This condition is best expressed using equation  13 : this equation tells us that the linear combination  ΣIJ =   cid:4 IJ  KL BKL +  BIJ  1 γ  1 2   14   it can be expressed as the exterior product of two one- is a simple two-form, i.e. forms. The requirement that ΣIJ is simple is called simplicity constraint and it can equivalently be stated as the condition ΣIJ ∧ ΣKL = 1 4!   cid:4 M N P Q ΣM N ∧ ΣP Q   cid:4 IJKL  quadratic simplicity constraint . The Plebanski action for general relativity for instance consists of the topological action Stop[B, ω] plus a term that imposes the vanishing of the quadratic simplicity constraint [48–50].  3. Classical Spinfoam Gravity: Degrees of Freedom and Foams  A classical spinfoam model is a topological ﬁeld theory of the type  6  with a ﬁnite number of dynamical degrees freedom associated to a network of topological defects. The defects are introduced by equipping the 4-manifold M with a cellular decomposition.  A cellular decomposition is a way to present a manifold as composed of simple elementary pieces, cells with the topology of a ball. The simplest example is a tri- angulation, the decomposition of a manifold into 4-simplices, tetrahedra, triangles, segments and points. Here we consider decompositions that allow more general adjacency relations between cells [51].  Let Bn be the open ball of dimension n, with n = 0, . . , 4. We denote by ¯Bn its closure and consider a set of homeomorphisms φi : ¯Bn → M that send the n-ball into a subset of M. We assume that the subset φi ∂ ¯Bn  is the disjoint union of a ﬁnite number of φi Bm . We denote by Δn ≡ {φi Bn  i = 1, . . , In} the set of cells of dimension n. If M is the disjoint union of cells {Δn}i ,   15  these data provide a cellular decomposition of the manifold M. We require the cellular decomposition to be simple: two n-cells share at most one  n − 1 -cell on their boundary. In this case the two cells are said to be adjacent. A manifold equipped with a cellular decomposition is also called a cellular manifold. We call Δ2 the 2-skeleton of the decomposition.  M =  In cid:16   4 cid:16   n=0  i=1  The spinfoam action consists of two terms, a 4-dimensional topological term of the form  6  and a term given by the integral of a 2-form over a branched surface   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 102  102  E. Bianchi  in M, the 2-skeleton Δ2 of a cellular decomposition. The second term breaks the  topological invariance of the ﬁrst and unfreezes a ﬁnite number of degrees of the connection. In order to describe a truncation of general relativity, the second term is chosen so to impose the simplicity of ΣIJ , equation  14  and the recovery of the area 2-form eI ∧ eJ , equation  13 . Diﬀerent spinfoam models correspond to diﬀerent proposals for the implementation of the simplicity of ΣIJ . Here we describe the spinfoam action corresponding to the Engle-Pereira-Rovelli-Livine — Freidel- Krasnov model [31–34] generalized to arbitrary cellular decompositions [52–54].  In two dimensions every 2-form is simple, therefore simplicity of ΣIJ is auto- matic. The only remaining requirement to be imposed on ΣIJ regards the induced signature of the 2-dimensional surface. We require that Δ2 is everywhere space-like by introducing a reference vector tI that is timelike, ηIJ tI tJ = −1. The spinfoam  action for gravity is then given by   cid:5    cid:5   S[B, ω, λ] =  BIJ ∧ F IJ +  M  λI tJ ΣIJ  Δ2  where λI is a 0-form playing the role of Lagrange multiplier imposing the linear simplicity constraint, i.e. the vanishing of the pull-back to Δ2 of tJ ΣIJ .  Using the reference vector tI we can decompose the BIJ ﬁeld into its dual  magnetic part BI and its dual electric part EI , 1 2  BI = BIJ tJ ,  EI =   cid:4 IJKLBJK tL .  The linear simplicity constraint tJ ΣIJ = 0 on Δ2 is then equivalent to the relation   16    17    18   BI = γ EI  on Δ2 ,  between the electric and the magnetic parts, pulled back on the 2-skeleton Δ2. This equation plays a central role in the deﬁnition of the quantum theory. Variation of the spinfoam action  16  with respect to the BIJ ﬁeld imposes that the Lorentz connection ω is locally ﬂat, F IJ = 0 in the bulk of M− Δ2. The constraint  18  on the electric and magnetic parts of the B ﬁeld however allow a curvature F IJ  cid:10 = 0 supported on Δ2. = M−Δ2 is path-connected but not simply- connected: there are closed paths in M cid:3  and are non-contractible.

A presentation of this group can be obtained by introducing the notion of two-complex Δ A combinatorial two-complex C =  F, E, V, ∂  is deﬁned by a ﬁnite set F of elements f called faces, a ﬁnite set E of elements e called edges, a ﬁnite set V of elements v called vertices, and a boundary relation ∂ that associates to each edge an ordered couple of vertices ∂e =  se, te  and to each face f a cyclic sequence of ∗ edges, ∂f =  e1, . . . , enf  . The two-complex Δ dual to the cellular decomposition Δ has a vertex per 4-cell, an edge per 3-cell and a face per 3-cell of Δ. Two vertices are connected by an edge if they are dual to two adjacent 4-cells.

As a result, it is also invariant under diﬀeomorphism of M that preserve the boundary of tf . A 2-complex C together with an assignment of holonomies he to its edges and ﬂuxes Bf to its faces is called a foam. Together with the linear simplicity constraint  18  they provide the classical building blocks of spinfoam gravity.  4. Unitary Representations of the Rotation and the Lorentz Group  ↑  The groups SU  2  and SL 2, C  are respectively the double cover of the rota- tion group SO 3  and of the part of the Lorentz group connected to the identity,  3, 1 . These two groups play a key role in spinfoam gravity: unitary repre- SO sentations are associated to the faces of a foam and provide the spins of spinfoam gravity. In this section we summarize the relevant mathematical notions involved in this construction.  Unitary representations of the group SU  2  on a Hilbert space V are generated  by three Hermitian operators Li, i = 1, 2, 3 obeying the commutation relations  [Li, Lj] = i cid:4 ij  kLk .  In the following we also use the vector notation  cid:2 x = xi and  cid:2 x· cid:2 y = δijxiyj. Irreducible representations V  j  are labeled by a half-integer j = 0, 1 2 , 1, . . . , the spin and are ﬁnite dimensional dim V  j  = 2j + 1.

Unitary representations of the group SL 2, C  on a Hilbert space V are inﬁnite dimensional and are generated by six Hermitian operators J IJ = −J JI , I, J = 0, 1, 2, 3.

As SU  2  is a subgroup of SL 2, C , they are also unitary representations of SU  2 , but reducible. In particular they decompose into irreducible representations as follows:  V  p, j  = V  j  ⊕ V  j+1  ⊕ V  j+2  ⊕ ··· .  In V  p,j  the two invariant Casimir operators C1 and C2 have eigenvalues  C1 =  C2 =  1 2 1 8  JIJ J IJ =  cid:2 K 2 −  cid:2 L2 = p2 − j2 + 1 ,  cid:4 IJKLJ IJ J KL =  cid:2 K ·  cid:2 L = p j .  We denote by   p, j ; j   cid:3   , m cid:9  ∈ V  p,j   with j with tI zI = 0.  The decomposition  27  allows us to identify the vector j   cid:3  ≥ j an orthonormal basis of simultaneous eigenstates of  cid:2 L2 and Lz = LI zI , m cid:9  that transforms , m cid:9  that under the representation j transforms in the representation j of the little group of the Lorentz group that leaves the time-like vector tI invariant.

In spinfoam gravity the map Yγ and the Hilbert space Vγ play a special role as  they provide a solution of the linear simplicity constraint with Barbero-Immirzi parameter γ.  5. Boundary Variables and the Loop Quantum Gravity Hilbert  Space  Consider a 4-manifold M with a 3-dimensional boundary M . The cellular de- composition Δ induces a decomposition Δ3 on the boundary. The boundary vari- ables of the classical theory  16  are the Lorentz connection ω together with its conjugate momentum, the B ﬁeld. The imposition of the linear simplicity con-  straint  18  on Δ2 reduces the symplectic form δBIJ ∧ δωIJ to δEI ∧ δAI where AI = ωIJ tJ + γ 1 2  cid:4 IJKLωJKtL is the real Ashtekar connection and EI its conjugate momentum, the dual electric ﬁeld [44, 46, 47]. Accordingly, the Lorentz gauge group SO 1, 3  reduces to the rotation subgroup SO 3  that leaves tI invariant. We work with the covering groups SL 2, C  and SU  2 .  The quantum theory is formulated in terms of gauge-invariant function-  als of the real Ashtekar connection. poses that the state Ψ[A] depends only on coordinates on the moduli space  Local ﬂatness in M   cid:3   = M − Δ1 im-   cid:3    cid:4   π1 M   , SU  2   Hom  SU  2 . A convenient set of coordinates is obtained by notic- ing that the 2-complex C = Δ ∗ ∗ induces on the boundary M a graph Γ =  Δ3  consisting of N nodes n dual to the 3-cells Δ3 and L links l dual to its 2-cells [56, 57]. We deﬁne the holonomy along links l of Γ as   cid:3   and the electric ﬂux through 2-cells tl of Δ2 as  hl = P exp i   cid:2 A ·  cid:2 σ 2  l  ,   cid:5    cid:5    cid:2 Ll =   cid:2 E ,  tl  105   31    32    33    34    35   where AI =  0, Ai  and EI =  0, Ei . As a result we recover the holonomy-ﬂux algebra of loop quantum gravity [58]  see Chapter 1 . The Hilbert space of states for given cellular decomposition Δ and boundary Δ3 is HΓ = L2 SU  2 L SU  2 N   ,   36    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 106  106  E. Bianchi  with states depending on the connection only via the holonomy, Ψ[A] = ψ hl[A] . An orthonormal basis HΓ is provided by the spin-network basis. The basic ingredi-  ents are SU  2  representation matrices  D j  h m  m cid:2  =  cid:8 j, mU  h j, m   cid:3  cid:9    37   and intertwiners im1···mNn , i.e. invariant tensors in the tensor product of SU  2  representations. It is useful to have a physical picture of what intertwiners are as they play a central role in what follows. They can be understood as the collective state i cid:9  of a system of N spins that is invariant under rotations. For instance, we can tot, where  cid:2 Ltot =  cid:2 L1 +··· +  cid:2 LN consider the ground state of the Hamiltonian H =  cid:2 L 2 is the total spin of the system. The ground state of H is in general degenerate and, when H = 0, the associated eigenspace is the Hilbert space of intertwiners Inv V  j1  ⊗ ··· ⊗ V  jN   . An orthonormal basis ik cid:9  of this space deﬁnes a set of invariant tensors via the formula  ik cid:9  =  im1···mN  k  j1m1 cid:9 ···jN mN cid:9 .   38    cid:8   m1···mN  Spin-network states are states in HΓ determined by an assignment of a spin jl to each link l ∈ Γ and of intertwiner in to each node n ∈ Γ.  cid:4   representation they are given by  In the holonomy   cid:3  cid:21    cid:3  cid:21    cid:4   D jl  hl   l∈Γ  ψjl,in  hl  =   39  where the dot · stands for contraction of tensors following the pattern of the graph Γ. More abstractly, we write Γ, jl, in cid:9  and ψjl,in hl  =  cid:8 hlΓ, jl, in cid:9 .  n∈Γ  In loop quantum gravity the electric ﬂux operator  cid:2 Ll, equation  35  acts as a left-invariant vector ﬁeld on functions of the holonomy. In spinfoam gravity, besides the electric ﬂux  cid:2 Ll, we have also a magnetic ﬂux  cid:2 Kl deﬁned by  in  ·   cid:5    40    41    cid:2 Kl =   cid:2 B  tl   cid:2 Kl = γ  cid:2 Ll .  where BI =  0, Bi , see equation  17 . Together they provide a representation of the algebra of the Lorentz group, equation  24 . The linear simplicity constraint  18  expressed in terms of electric and magnetic ﬂuxes is  Now we show how to embed the space of spin-networks in a larger space that carries a representation of  cid:2 Kl,  cid:2 Ll and solves the linear simplicity constraint.

Because of the result  33 , matrix elements of  cid:2 Kl − γ  cid:2 Ll always  vanish on this basis of functions. Therefore they provide a solution of the linear simplicity constraint.  6. Spinfoam Partition Function and the Vertex Amplitude   cid:5    cid:4   The path integral over the B ﬁeld for the topological ﬁeld theory  6  simply imposes the ﬂatness of the connection,   cid:2   DBIJ e i  BIJ∧F IJ  = δ[F  ω ] .  In the presence of a cellular decomposition Δ we can focus on a region that contains a single 2-cell tf . The delta function imposes that the holonomy of the connection along a path that encircles tf vanishes. It is useful to use the language of the dual 2- complex C = Δ ∗ introduced before. The closed path around a 2-cell is a sequence of edges e belonging to the boundary of a face f of the 2-complex. The delta function can then be written in terms of holonomies Ge along edges, equation  19  and can be expressed in terms of representations of the Lorentz group as   cid:3   cid:17   e∈∂f  Atop f  Ge  = δ   cid:8    cid:5  ∞  k=0, 1  2 ,···  0  Ge  =  dp  p2 + k2  Tr  D p,k  Ge   .   46    cid:3   cid:17   e∈∂f   cid:4   On the other hand for the spinfoam action  16 , because of the simplicity constraint, it is not the case that the connection is imposed to be ﬂat. Focusing again on a  closed path that encircles a single defect tf ∈ Δ2 we ﬁnd a face amplitude  Af  Ge  =   2j + 1  Tr  † γ D γ j+1 , j  Ge  Yγ  Y  .   47    cid:4    cid:3   cid:17   e∈∂f   cid:8   j  As discussed in  44  the map Yγ provides a solution of the linear simplicity con- straint. The path integral over the full manifold M is obtained as a product over the amplitudes Af  Ge  associated to faces of the dual 2-complex, integrated over the  edge holonomies. In the presence of a boundary we can hold ﬁxed the holonomies Gl along links on the boundary and deﬁne the transition amplitude  WC Gl  =  dGe  Af  Ge  .   48    cid:5    cid:17   f  The transition amplitude allows us to evolve a loop quantum gravity state once written in the form equation  44 .

This completes the mathematical deﬁnition of the partition function and transition amplitude for spinfoam gravity.  7. Cellular Quantum Geometry: A Single Atom of Space  At the classical level the electric part of the ﬁeld BIJ endows the cellular decompo- sition with a geometric interpretation. In this section we describe the phase space of convex polyhedra, its quantization in terms of SU  2  intertwiners and the relation to the constrained topological quantum ﬁeld theory deﬁned by the spinfoam action.  7.1. Minkowski Theorem and the Phase Space of Polyhedra  A tetrahedron is the convex hull of four points in 3-dimensional Euclidean space R3. Its geometry can be described using a triad of edge-vectors  cid:2 ei  i = 1, 2, 3 . For  cid:2 e1 ·   cid:2 e2 ×  cid:2 e3 . From the instance, the volume of the tetrahedron is given by V = 1 3! triad we can compute the normal to the plane supporting a face of the tetrahedron, 2  cid:2 e1 ×  cid:2 e2. The normals  cid:2 La, with a = 1, 2, 3, 4, are normalized for instance  cid:2 L3 = 1 to the area Aa of the associated face and can be chosen to be outward-pointing. Notice that they sum up to zero, as it happens for any closed surface.  A remarkable property of the face-normals is that they can be used as funda-  mental variables: a set of four vectors  cid:2 La satisfying the closure condition  completely describes the geometry of a tetrahedron.a The norm of the vector  cid:2 La is the area of the face a of the tetrahedron, so that we can write   cid:2 L1 +  cid:2 L2 +  cid:2 L3 +  cid:2 L4 = 0   cid:2 La = Aa  cid:2 na   51    52   where  cid:2 na is the unit outward-pointing normal to the face a. The scalar product   cid:2 La ·  cid:2 Lb = AaAb cos θab   53  aA counting of the number of independent variables up to rotations is in order: we have 4 × 3 vector components, −3 components from the closure condition, −3 rotations, equals 6 indepen- dent variables. This number matches the number of edge-lengths that one can use to describe a tetrahedron.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 109  Spinfoam Gravity  109  measures the dihedral angle θab between two faces of the tetrahedron. Similarly, the triple product of any three normals is related to the volume of the tetrahedron by the formula   cid:31   √  2 3  V =   cid:2 L1 ·   cid:2 L2 ×  cid:2 L3  .  The space of tetrahedra with faces of ﬁxed areas Aa has a remarkable property: it has the structure of a phase space with respect to a natural choice of rotationally- invariant Poisson brackets induced by the canonical brackets {ni, nj} = εij k nk for unit vectors on the sphere. Consider two functions f   cid:2 La  and g  cid:2 La  on the space of shapes of tetrahedra with faces of ﬁxed areas Aa. The Poisson brackets  %   cid:3   &  4 cid:8   a=1   cid:2 La ·  ∂f ∂ cid:2 La  × ∂g ∂ cid:2 La   cid:4   f   cid:2 La , g  cid:2 La   =  make this space into a phase space. The phase space of a tetrahedron with ﬁxed areas is 2-dimensional and a set of canonical variables {q, p} = 1 is given by  q = angle between  cid:2 L1 ×  cid:2 L2 and  cid:2 L3 ×  cid:2 L4 , p =  cid:2 L1 +  cid:2 L2 .   54    55    56    57   Every geometric property of the tetrahedron, such as the volume V , can be under- stood as a function of q and p.  There are two elegant mathematical results that allow us to extend the previous construction from tetrahedra to convex polyhedra in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The ﬁrst result is a theorem of Minkowski’s [59] that states that the areas Aa and the unit-normals  cid:2 na to the faces of the polyhedron fully characterize its shape,b see Figure 2. We deﬁne the vectors  cid:2 La = Aa  cid:2 na and call PN the space of shapes of polyhedra with N faces of given areas Aa,  PN =   cid:2 La, a = 1 . . N   cid:2 L1 + ··· +  cid:2 LN = 0 ,  cid:31  cid:2 La cid:31  = Aa   SO 3  .   58   &  %  naturally the structure of a phase space [60]. The Poisson brackets between two  The second is a result of Kapovich and Millson’s that states that the set PN has N cid:8  functions f   cid:2 La  and g  cid:2 La  on PN are  %  &   cid:3    cid:4   f, g  =   cid:2 La ·  ∂f ∂ cid:2 La  × ∂g ∂ cid:2 La  .  a=1   59   As in the case of the tetrahedron, these brackets arise  via symplectic reduction  from the rotationally-invariant Poisson brackets between functions f   cid:2 La  on  S2 N . Thus we have that convex polyhedra with N faces of given areas form a 2 N − 3  dimensional phase space [53].   cid:2   bMore precisely, given a set of N positive numbers Aa, and N unit-vectors  cid:5 na satisfying the a Aa cid:5 na = 0, there always exists a convex polyhedron having these data as areas and condition normals to its faces. Moreover, up to rotations SO 3 , the polyhedron is unique.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 110  110  E. Bianchi   cid:2 n  h  !  Fig. 2. A convex polyhedron can be obtained starting from N planes passing through the origin of 3d Euclidean space. Moving each plane in the direction of its normal  cid:5 na deﬁnes a convex hull, a polyhedron. Adjusting the distance ha of a plane from the origin changes the areas Aa of the faces of the polyhedron. This procedure can be used to build a polyhedron with faces of given areas Aa satisfying the closure condition a Aa cid:5 na = 0 . The Minkowski theorem states that such polyhedron exists and, up to rotations, is unique. A variational algorithm to reconstruct the polyhedron can be found in [53].   cid:2   Canonical variables on this phase space can be chosen as follows: consider the   cid:2 La, where i = 1,··· , N − 3; we deﬁne the coordinate set of vectors  cid:2 pi = qi as the angle between the vectors  cid:2 pi ×  cid:2 Li+1 and  cid:2 pi ×  cid:2 Li+2, and the momentum variable pi =  cid:31  cid:2 pi cid:31  as the norm of the vector  cid:2 pi. From  59 , it follows that these are canonically conjugate variables, {qi, pj} = δij .  i+1 a=1  Every geometric quantity, e.g. the length of an edge or the volume of the poly- hedron [61], is a function of the canonical variables  qi, pi . The problem of deter- mining this function is well-deﬁned but not immediate to solve. The reason is that we have to reconstruct ﬁrst the shape of the polyhedron from the normals to its faces, or equivalently from the point in phase space [53]. In general, the problem can be solved numerically using Lasserre’s algorithm [62]. In the case of a pentahedron N = 5 the problem has been solved analytically, and an expression of the volume V  q1, q2, p1, p2  as a function in phase space is available [63]. It is interesting to notice that the classical dynamics of this system is strongly chaotic [63, 64].  7.2. Spin-geometry and Quantum Polyhedra  In quantum mechanics a spin system identiﬁes a quantum direction in space. A remarkable idea proposed by Penrose in 1971 is that the angles between these quan- tum directions deﬁne a geometry, Penrose’s ‘spin-geometry’, and can provide the   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 111  Spinfoam Gravity  111   60    61    62   elementary building-block of quantum space [65–68]. This model for an atom of space has later been shown to coincide with the notion of ‘quantum polyhedron’, the quantization of the classical system described in the previous section [53, 69–71]. Consider the simple quantum mechanical system described by an intertwiner i cid:9  ∈ Inv V j1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ V jN  , equation  38 . The observables of the system are the rotational invariant operators that can be built from the angular momenta  cid:2 La only  a = 1, . . . , N  . As the state i cid:9  of our system is rotationally invariant,c we have    cid:2 L1 + ··· +  cid:2 LN  i cid:9  = 0 ,  a quantum closure condition analogous to equation  51 . The geometric interpreta- tion of the observables  cid:2 La comes from identifying them with the normals to planes passing through a point in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. In particular, the Penrose ‘metric’ operator is given by the scalar product  cid:2 La·  cid:2 Lb, up to a scale with dimensions of length 4. This scale can be ﬁxed by making reference to equation  13 : when the linear simplicity constraint is  18  is satisﬁed, we have that the 2-form built out of the tetrad can be written in terms of the electric part of the BIJ ﬁeld,   cid:4 IJKLeJ ∧ eK tL = 8πGN γ EI .  1 2  When integrated over a 2-cell of Δ2, equation  35 , we ﬁnd that the integrated area-element is 8πGN γ  cid:2 La. We deﬁne the Penrose operator by  ˆgab =  8πGN γ 2  cid:2 La ·  cid:2 Lb .  √ ˆgaa ˆgbb  . A basis of intertwiner states ik1···kN−3  It measures the angle [68] θab between the a-planes and the b-plane via the formula  cid:9  is a basis of θab = arccos ˆgab  eigenstates of a maximal commuting set of operators ˆgab. For instance, the spectrum of ˆg12 is given by ˆg12 ik1···kN−3   cid:9  .  63  As explained in the previous section, the point of intersection of the N planes can be inﬂated into a polyhedron by moving the planes away from the origin. This deﬁnes a polygon on each plane, i.e. a face of the polyhedron. The norm of the operator  cid:2 La measures the area Aa of this face   cid:9  =  8πGN γ 2 k1 k1 + 1  − j1 j1 + 1  − j2 j2 + 1   ik1···kN−3  2   cid:2    64  Its eigenvalues are immediate to compute and every state i cid:9  in our Hilbert space is an eigenstates of the area operator  ˆgaa = 8πGN γ  Aa =  Aa i cid:9  = 8πGN γ   65   cThe proof is immediate: a ﬁnite rotation of the system is generated by the unitary operator U   cid:5 α  = exp i cid:5 α ·  cid:5 Ltot ; the invariance of the state under rotations is U   cid:5 α i cid:6  = i cid:6  for all rotation parameters  cid:5 α. Expanding at the linear order in small  cid:5 α one recovers the closure condition.   cid:31    cid:2 La· cid:2 La .   cid:2  ja ja + 1  i cid:9  .

Bianchi  √  The spectrum of the area is discrete and gapped, with a Planck scale gap a0 = 8πGN γ 3 2 corresponding to the minimum non-trivial spin ja = 1 2. This for- mula matches the spectrum of the area operator found in canonical loop quantum gravity [67, 72–74].  The system that we have described plays the role of atom of space in spinfoam gravity. It can be understood as a quantum polyhedron as it can be obtained by quantizing a classical dynamical system: a convex polyhedron with canonical Poisson brackets. This is analogous to the case of the hydrogen atom, a purely quantum system that can be deﬁned via the quantization of a classical particle in a Keplerian orbit. In the next section we discuss coherent states and the semiclassical behavior of the quantum system.  7.3. Heisenberg Uncertainty Relations for Quantum Geometry  Diﬀerent components of the angular momentum do not commute [Li, Lj] = i εij k Lk. As a result the dispersions ΔLi on any spin state satisfy the uncertainty relationsd   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  cid:4 ij   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  .  ΔLi ΔLj ≥ 1 2  k cid:8 Lk cid:9   This is also the behavior of the quantum directions  cid:2 La: the atom of space has a non-commutative quantum geometry. The phenomenon is most clearly illustrated in terms of the Penrose metric operator ˆgab. Consider three quantum planes a, b, c, and the angle between a, b and a, c. The associated Penrose operators do not commute  [ ˆgab, ˆgac ] = i  8πGN γ 4  cid:2 La·  cid:2 Lb ×  cid:2 Lc   and the commutator measures the linear independence of the three quantum planes. The Heisenberg uncertainty relation for the quantum geometry reads  Δˆgab Δˆgac ≥ 1  2   8πGN γ 4   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  cid:8  cid:2 La·  cid:2 Lb ×  cid:2 Lc  cid:9    cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  .  As a result the shape of a quantum polyhedron is fuzzy: if we try to determine with precision the angle between the planes a and b, then we lose control of the angle between the planes a and c unless the three are coplanar.  At the classical level we saw that qi and pi are canonical variables on the phase space of polyhedra.

This regime corresponds to a size of the polyhedron that is large compared to the Planck scale, for instance the area of a face being much larger than the area gap a0 = 8πGN γ 3 2. Formally large j corresponds to the limit 8πGN γ → 0 while keeping ﬁxed the physical area of a  √  face. In this limit the Heisenberg uncertainty relations  68  become trivial.  The shape of a classical polyhedron is completely coded in the canonical variables  qi, pi  on phase space, in particular the normals  cid:2 na can be computed from them.

It is interesting to connect these recent developments with the original idea proposed by Penrose [65, 66]. The spin-geometry theorem states that there exist collective spin states such that, in the classical limit, the expectation value of the Penrose metric reproduces the scalar products of a set of N vectors  cid:2 va in 3d Eu- clidean space,  cid:8 ˆgab cid:9  =  cid:2 va ·  cid:2 vb, and the relative dispersions vanish. The coherent  states for an atom of space discussed above provide a concrete example of such states and play a central role in spinfoam gravity.  8. Cellular Quantum Geometry: Coherent Spin-networks  The atoms of space discussed in the previous section arise naturally as building blocks of boundary states in spinfoam gravity, see Section 5.  Consider a graph Γ consisting of N nodes connected by L links. To each link ll  we associate a state jl, ml cid:9 jl, m  cid:9  of two spins with the same jl. Each of the two  cid:3  l spins lives at an endpoint of the link. The Hilbert space of the system is simply given by a tensor product over the links of factors V  jl  ⊗ V  jl . Equivalently we ln∈∂l V  jl . can organize the spins in groups sitting at nodes n of the network, We are interested in conﬁgurations of this system such that the spins sitting at each node are in a rotationally-invariant state. These states form a Hilbert space:   cid:28   with Hn = Inv ⊗ln∈∂l V  jl  : the system consists of an atom of space at each node of the graph. We can describe the state of the system in terms of the states in of each atom of space at a node n, with the graph Γ coding which nodes are connected by a link and thus share the same spin jl. The state Γ, jl, in cid:9  that we have described HΓ associated to the boundary of the cellular decomposition Δ, equation  36 ,  is a spin-network state and it belongs to the loop quantum gravity Hilbert space   cid:21   n∈Γ  HΓ,jl =  Hn   cid:20    cid:21   {jl}  n∈Γ  HΓ =  Hn .   77    78   The geometric picture arising from this construction is that a spin-network state can be thought of as a collection of quantum polyhedra. Adjacent polyhedra share a face with matching areas, but not necessarily matching shapes. This structure is called a twisted geometry [79, 80].

The smooth metric qab on M can now be thought of as a large-scale approximation of one of these piecewise-ﬂat metrics. A piecewise-ﬂat metric on the cellular manifold  M, Δ3  is fully determined by the description of the polyhedral geometry of each cell, the adjacency relation of the cells and matching conditions for the shape of interfaces between cells. This set of data corresponds to a dual graph Γ =  Δ3  , an assignment of areas jl to the links of the graph and an assignment of unit-vectors  cid:2 nsl ,  cid:2 ntl corresponding to normals to faces that satisfy the closure and shape-matching conditions.

In the canonical formulation these two quantities are canonical conjugate variables. In the presence of a cellular decomposition Δ, the extrinsic curvature can be dis- cretized as done for the metric: the piecewise-ﬂat version of the extrinsic curvature pab corresponds to an assignment of time-like four-vectors tI n, one per cell of the we can compute the Lorentzian decomposition Δ3.

Vertex-amplitude Asymptotics and Regge Gravity  The spinfoam dynamics is fully coded into the vertex amplitude  ∗  tion  50 . It describes the dynamics of a single 4-cell of Δ. To understand its role it is useful to compute the amplitude it associates to a semiclassical boundary geometry.  The boundary of a 4-cell σ consists in a collection of 3-cells. We denote v = σ the spinfoam vertex dual to the cell and Γv the graph that codes the adjacency relations between the 3-cells on the boundary of σ, i.e. Γv =  ∂σ  . We denote n the N nodes of Γv. To the graph Γv we associate a boundary state ψΓv,jl,in  hl  and compute its amplitude.  ∗  N n=1 tI  !  n satisfying the closure condition  We choose the boundary state to describe the classical geometry of the bound- ary of a polyhedron in 4-dimensional Minkowski space. The Lorentzian version of the Minkowski theorem of Section 7.1 [84] states that, given a set of time-like vectors tI n = 0, there is a unique con- ntJ vex Lorentzian polyhedron σ with 3-dimensional faces of volume Vn = n and unit normal ˆtI n. The boundary of the Lorentzian polyhedron con- sists of a collection of N Euclidean polyhedra. We call N− and N+ the number of past-pointing and future-pointing time-like vectors and say that the 4-dimensional polyhedron σ describes the transition from N− to N+ Euclidean polyhedra. The 4-dimensional Lorentzian geometry of the polyhedron σ induces an assignment of areas Al and 3-normals  cid:2 nsl of the boundary polyhedra. We use these data as labels for the boundary state. The vertex amplitude Av jab, ia  cid:2 nab   for this boundary state is simply given   cid:2 −ηIJ tI  −1 n tI  n = V  by the evaluation of equation  50  on the set of intertwiners in  cid:2 nsl  ,  %  &   cid:5  N cid:17   Yγ ie  =  v  dGn  n=2   cid:17   l∈Γv  Av jl, in  cid:2 nsl    =   cid:8 jl,  cid:2 nsl  Y  † γ U  GslG  tl  Yγjl,  cid:2 ntl −1   cid:9  .   83  This expression has a remarkable asymptotic behavior in the limit of large spins jl.

This formula provides a generalization of the Ponzano-Regge formula [4]  1  to 4-dimensional Lorentzian general relativity. Notice how the Barbero-Immirzi parameter γ has disappeared from the ﬁnal asymptotic formula, consistently with the independence of classical Einstein equations from this parameter, equation  10 .  10. Reconstructing a Semiclassical Spacetime  In Section 8 we have discussed coherent spin-network states. These states are peaked on the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of a cellular decomposition of space. In this section we discuss how to reconstruct a semiclassical spacetime in spinfoam gravity.  Consider a 4-manifold M with a Lorentzian metric gμν. We are interested in a ﬁnite spacetime region R with a purely spatial boundary Σ = ∂R = Σ1 ∪ Σ2. The metric gμν induces an intrinsic and an extrinsic geometry on the past and the future boundaries denoted Σ1 and Σ2, Figure 3. Here we are interested in the converse problem of reconstructing the geometry in the bulk of R from data on the boundary. A cellular decomposition Δ of the region R induces a cellular decomposition Δ3 of its boundary. The dual description consists in a 2-complex C = Δ ∗ and a graph Γ =  Δ3  associated to its boundary. In spinfoam gravity we associate a Γ Gl  to the boundary graph, equation  44  and an amplitude WC Gl  to the state ψγ 2-complex, equation  48  [87, 88]. It is useful to think of the spinfoam amplitude as a linear functional on boundary states and adopt the bra-ket notation  ∗   cid:5    cid:8 WCψΓ cid:9  =  dGl WC Gl  ψγ  Γ Gl  .  The expectation value of a boundary operator O1, such as the Penrose operator ˆgab  of equation  62 , is given by   86    87    cid:8 O1 cid:9  =   cid:8 WCO1ψΓ cid:9   cid:8 WCψΓ cid:9   .   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 118  118  E. Bianchi  A semiclassical boundary state as the one discussed in equation  82  has the prop- erty of being peaked on a classical intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the boundary as measured by boundary operators. The spinfoam path-integral provides a sum over quantum spacetime geometries in R. These geometries can be probed by computing the expectation values of bulk operators O, Figure 3. We say that the boundary state determines a semiclassical spacetime when the expectation values of the bulk operators satisfy the equations of motion of the classical spinfoam gravity action  16 , i.e. a discrete version of Einstein equations, and have small dispersion.  Current studies of the reconstruction of a classical spacetime geometry from spinfoam gravity have focused on saddle-point methods: a semiclassical bound- ary state determines the dominating contributions of the spinfoam action and the evaluation of expectation values of observables is given by the saddle point of the action [89–95]. The asymptotic result  84  falls in this class [85, 86]. Similarly, in spinfoam cosmology [96–98] one considers boundary states peaked on homoge- neous 3-geometries and shows that a semiclassical cosmological spacetime solving Friedmann equations is reconstructed in the bulk.  A semiclassical spacetime consists of a classical conﬁguration of the geometry together with quantum ﬂuctuations. Correlations of ﬂuctuations can be probed by computing for instance the connected 2-point function of Penrose metric operators  Cabcd =  cid:8 ˆgab ˆgcd cid:9  −  cid:8 ˆgab cid:9  cid:8 ˆgcd cid:9  .   88   These correlations have been studied using the saddle-point approximation and shown to match the graviton propagator of perturbative quantum gravity [99–107]. Going beyond the saddle-point approximation requires new methods. A natu- ral tool is the numerical implementation of the spinfoam sum [108], equation  49 , together with renormalization group techniques [109, 110]  see Chapter 5.  Note that, for ﬁxed cellular decomposition Δ, the spinfoam path integral has only a ﬁnite  although large  number of degrees of freedom. Moreover the theory has no ultravi- olet divergences because of the discrete nature of the spectrum of SU  2  represen- tations appearing in the spinfoam sum  49 . The technical problem is similar to the one of lattice gauge theory, but the physical picture is rather diﬀerent: the discrete- ness of the theory is not the artifact of a lattice regularization but a prediction of the √ cellular quantum geometry. The quantization of electric ﬂuxes reﬂects itself into the discrete spectrum of the area operator with a Planck scale gap a0 = 8πGN γ 3 2. Note that, while there are no ultraviolet divergences, the theory deﬁned in this chapter has infrared divergences corresponding to conﬁgurations with large spins jl [111]. In the presence of a positive cosmological constant the theory is also in- frared ﬁnite [35–38]. Moreover, the theory described in this chapter concerns only the spinfoam dynamics at ﬁxed cellular decomposition Δ, or equivalently at ﬁxed 2-complex C = Δ ∗ . The inclusion of a sum over 2-complexes is a natural extension and a needed one in order to match the full Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity. Group ﬁeld theory [112, 113] provides a natural assignment of weights to diﬀer-   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 119  Spinfoam Gravity  119  ent 2-complexes together with a Feynman diagrammatic scheme  see Chapter 4 . Numerical techniques developed in the framework of causal dynamical triangula- tions [114] are also expected to be relevant, although this direction is yet to be explored.  11. Conclusions  Spinfoam gravity has its roots in the formulation of general relativity as a topolog- ical ﬁeld theory with constraints. It is a theory with a ﬁnite but large number of degrees of freedom associated with Wilson loops of the Lorentz connections around 2-dimensional defects in a cellular decomposition of a 4-manifold. Remarkably, the theory provides a covariant formulation of canonical loop quantum gravity and equips the quantum geometry of loop quantum gravity with a spacetime picture. Moreover, spinfoams bring into loop quantum gravity techniques previously devel- oped in the context of Regge’s discrete approach to gravity, at the classical and the quantum levels. These techniques have been used to show how a semiclassical spacetime can be reconstructed from a sum over quantum geometries and provide an avenue for studying the dynamics of loop quantum gravity beyond the semiclassical regime.

GFT from LQG Perspective: The Underlying Ideas  1.1. A Historical Prelude  Group ﬁeld theories can be approached from diﬀerent angles, coming from diﬀerent lines of research in quantum gravity. Historically, their ﬁrst appearance [2, 3] came as a development of tensor models [4]  themselves a generalization of matrix models [5], which provided a successful quantization of  pure  2d gravity , allowing to make contact with state sum formulations of 3d quantum gravity  Ponzano-Regge and Turaev-Viro model , whose relation with simplicial quantum gravity [6], was already known, and more generally topological BF theory in any dimension. These ﬁrst models were obtained by taking the simplest tensor model for 3d simplicial gravity and:  1  replacing the domain set for the tensor indices with a group mani- fold  SU  2  ;  2  adding a gauge invariance property to the ﬁeld  tensor , with the eﬀect of introducing a gauge connection on the lattices generated by the perturba- tive expansion of the model. The triviality of the kinetic and interaction kernels  simple delta functions on the group  in the GFT action resulted in the amplitudes matching those of BF theory discretized on the same lattices  imposing ﬂatness of the connection . Written in terms of group representations, the same amplitudes took the form of the state sums mentioned above. This is the ﬁrst way to understand group ﬁeld theories: GFTs can be seen as tensor models enriched by algebraic data with a quantum geometric interpretation  allowing a nice encoding of discrete grav- ity degrees of freedom , or, equivalently, as more general class of combinatorially non-local ﬁeld theories of tensorial type. The relation between state sum models of topological ﬁeld theory, and their GFT formulation, and loop quantum gravity was soon pointed out in [7]  where the link to the dynamical triangulations approach [8] was also mentioned : the boundary states of such models matched the newly devel- oped loop representation for quantum gravity [9]. Indeed, spin networks  introduced in LQG immediately afterwards  that are discussed in Chapter 1 describe also the  125   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 126  126  D. Oriti  Hilbert space of GFT models. The latter then acquired a nice interpretation from the LQG perspective: GFTs are quantum ﬁeld theories for spin networks, providing them with a covariant dynamics. This covariant deﬁnition started being developed a few years later [10–12]. Indeed, interest in GFTs as quantum gravity models was enhanced with the realization that they provide a complete deﬁnition of spin foam models for 4d gravity [13] discussed in Chapter 3: they capture the same quantum amplitudes as Feynman amplitudes, organizing them coherently in a sum over spin foam complexes, arising from the perturbative expansion of the ﬁeld theory. It is in this context that most developments have taken place in subsequent years, bring- ing in particular an improved understanding of the quantum geometry encoded in several interesting spin foam models for 4d gravity. Finally, in recent years we have witnessed a renaissance of tensor models [14], with important mathematical results concerning their combinatorial structures. Since they share the same combinatorial structures as GFTs, this has triggered further developments in GFTs. Indeed, it is by combining the tools coming from tensor models and the quantum geometric understanding provided by loop quantum gravity and spin foam models that, we believe, we have the best chance to make progress on the remaining open issues of quantum gravity, within the GFT framework.  1.2. A Brief Deﬁnition  A  single-ﬁeld  GFT is a theory of a ﬁeld ϕ : G group manifold G, with action  ∗ S ϕ, ϕ    =  [dgI ][dg  ∗   cid:3  J ]ϕ   gI  K gI , g   cid:5   cid:8   i   cid:5   λi Di!  +  [dgI1]...[dgJDi ]ϕ  ×d → C deﬁned on d copies of a   cid:3  J   +   cid:3  J   ϕ g  gI1  . . .Vi gI1, ..., gJDi  ··· ϕ gJDi    1   ∗  where i labels the possible interaction terms  weighted by coupling constants , each involving Di ﬁelds  or their complex conjugates , in turn depending on d group elements each. A speciﬁc GFT model is deﬁned by a choice of group G, dimension d, kinetic and interaction kernels K and Vi. The crucial feature of GFT models, as  opposed to ordinary  local  QFTs on space-time, beside the physical interpretation of all the ingredients, is that the interaction kernels, ﬁeld arguments are related in a combinatorially non-local way, i.e. each ﬁeld is correlated to the others only through some of its arguments. The speciﬁc combinatorial pattern of such correlations is another deﬁning property of speciﬁc models, as we will discuss  see [15] for an extensive treatment of the combinatorial aspects of GFTs .  This combinatorial non-locality becomes manifest in the quantum theory, de-  ﬁned in perturbation theory by the partition function:   cid:5   Z =  DϕDϕ ∗  − S ϕ,ϕ ∗ e    =  i λni Γ  sym Γ   i  AΓ   2   ’   cid:8   Γ   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 127  Group Field Theory  127  where Γ denotes GFT Feynman diagrams, sym Γ  the order of their automorphism  group, ni Γ  the number of interaction vertices of type i, and AΓ is the corre- propagators. Again, the explicit form of the amplitudes AΓ and the combinatorial  sponding Feynman amplitude, obtained by convolution of interaction kernels with  structure of the diagrams Γ depend on the model considered. The combinatorial non-locality of the interaction terms, however, generically implies that GFT Feyn- man diagrams are not graphs but cellular complexes of arbitrary topology.  The combinatorial structure of GFT ﬁelds, action, Feynman diagrams, quantum states and amplitudes, are the same as those of tensor models [4, 14]enriched by the additional group-theoretic data. Because of them, GFTs are quantum ﬁeld theories whose basic quanta are spin network vertices, i.e. nodes with d open links, labelled by the same algebraic data of LQG states, and their Feynman amplitudes  AΓ are generically spin foam amplitudes. Spin foam amplitudes are, in turn, dual  to lattice gravity path integrals, so GFTs combine the main ideas of dynamical triangulations  quantum gravity as a sum over random lattices  [8] and of quantum Regge calculus [6]  quantum gravity as a sum over geometric data assigned to a given lattice .  In the following, we will highlight structures shared with other ways of doing loop quantum gravity, as well as points of departure and new concepts brought in by the GFT reformulation. We will also discuss how GFTs cast the problem of deﬁning a background independent theory of quantum gravity based on LQG ideas in a QFT language. This allows the use of several powerful tools, to realize concretely the notion of ‘quantum atoms of space’ and to treat spacetime, indeed, like a condensed matter quantum system, suggesting new lines of developments.  2. GFT Kinematics: Hilbert Space and Observables  2.1. Fock Space of Quantum States   cid:4 &   ∞  % cid:3   V =0 sym  The Hilbert space of states for single-ﬁeld GFTs is a Fock space built out ‘single-atom’ Hilbert space Hv = L2 G of a fundamental v ⊗ H 2  H 1  *  , where sym indicates symmetrization with respect to the permutation group SV [16]. This encodes bosonic statistics for ﬁeld operators  other possibilities can be considered [17, 18]  †  ×d : F Hv  = *  v ⊗ ··· ⊗ H V          v   cid:3    cid:3    cid:3    cid:3   where IG  cid:2 g,  cid:2 g  d i=1 δ gi g     = IG  cid:2 g,  cid:2 g     [ ˆϕ  cid:2 g  , ˆϕ  cid:2 g  = 0  cid:3  −1 , and we used the notation  cid:2 g =  g1, .., gd . i     cid:2 g  , ˆϕ   ] =    cid:2 g      3   † ˆϕ  cid:2 g  , ˆϕ    ≡’    cid:2 g   cid:3   † ˆϕ  In quantum gravity models G is chosen to be the local gauge group of gravity in the appropriate dimension and signature, i.e. G = SU  2 , SL 2, R  in 3d and G = Spin 4 , SL 2, C  in 4d  or their SU  2  subgroup, for connecting with LQG . Each Hilbert space Hv provides the space of states of a single “quantum” of the  GFT ﬁeld, a quantum gravity ‘atom’. It can be understood as a fundamental spin network vertex, represented by a node with d outgoing links  ending up in 1-valent   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 128  128  D. Oriti   cid:7   nodes , labelled by group elements, or as a 3-cell  polyhedron  with d boundary faces. This is just a pictorial representation. Whether the states represent quantum gravity spin network vertices or geometric polyhedra depends on the type of data they carry and the dynamics they satisfy. For G = SU  2 , and with the closure  condition ϕ gI   = ϕ hgI   ∀h ∈ G imposed on the ﬁelds, however, the polyhedral interpretation is justiﬁed and the same is true for G = SL 2, C  and G = Spin 4  with simplicity constraints and closure conditions correctly imposed. In particular, for d = 4, the GFT quanta represent quantum tetrahedra and their Hilbert space , where each HJi is the Hilbert space of an  is Hv = irreducible unitary representation of SU  2  labeled by the half-integer Ji.   cid:6 HJ1 ⊗ ... ⊗ HJ4  Ji∈N 2 Inv     2.2. Quantum Observables  Kinematical observables are functionals of the ﬁeld operators O cid:6   . Of spe- cial importance are polynomial observables, whose evaluation in the vacuum state deﬁnes GFT n-point functions [19]. Any convolution of a ﬁnite number of GFT ﬁeld operators with appropriate kernels would deﬁne one such observable, as in any quantum ﬁeld theory. The peculiarity of GFTs, with respect to ordinary QFTs, is the possibility for these kernels to have a richer combinatorial structure, involving a non-local pairing of ﬁeld arguments, i.e. relating only a subset of the d arguments of a given GFT ﬁeld with a subset of the arguments of a diﬀerent one. Of particular interest for LQG are ‘spin network observables’:  † cid:7   ˆϕ, ˆϕ  OΨ= γ,J  †  ij  ,ιi   ˆϕ   ab     =  [dgia]  Ψ γ,J   ab    ij  ,ιi  giag  −1 jb    †  ˆϕ   gia ,   4    cid:4    cid:3  cid:17    cid:5    i    cid:17   i  where gia  resp. gjb   with a, b = 1, ..., d  are group elements related to the ar- guments of the ﬁeld associated to the vertex i  resp. j , so that a pair of indices ij   is  a, b  denotes each of the edges connecting two vertices i and j, Ψ γ,J a spin network functional labelled by a closed graph γ with representations J  ab   ij  associated to its edges, and intertwiners ιi to its vertices. The bosonic statistics implies that Ψ is symmetric under permutations of vertex labels. This observable creates a spin network state associated to a graph γ out of the Fock vacuum.   ij  ,ιi  Gab   ab   2.3. GFT as Second Quantized Reformulation of the LQG  Kinematics  We now discuss in what sense GFT provides a second quantized formalism for spin networks and how can one directly link  a certain version of  canonical LQG and GFT [16] .  By ‘LQG kinematical Hilbert space’ we intend, here, a Hilbert space constructed out of states associated to closed graphs and such that, for each graph γ, we have  here G = SU  2  , where e are the links of  GE GV , dμ =  Hγ = L2  E e=1 dμHaar  e  the graph  E is their total number , with a graph-based scalar product deﬁning the  ’   cid:3    cid:4    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 129  Group Field Theory  129  e  Haar measure on each link μHaar . The same Hilbert space can be represented also in the ﬂux basis, via the non-commutative Fourier transform [20]. The union for all graphs of such Hilbert spaces is, of course, not a Hilbert space. In the LQG and spin foam literature, one ﬁnds diﬀerent ways in which these graph-based Hilbert spaces can be organized to deﬁne the Hilbert space of the theory. The GFT Hilbert space achieves this result by ‘decomposing them into elementary building blocks’.   cid:4  The basic idea is to consider any wave function in Hγ, where γ is a graph  with V nodes, as an element of HV = L2  , satisfying special restrictions. The latter is the space of V spin network vertices, each possessing d outgoing open links, and the extra restrictions enforce the gluing of suitable pairs of such open links to form the links of the graph γ. A function Ψγ can be obtained from a wavefunction φV ∈ HV as ΨΓ Gab  ij , . . .  = ΨΓ gia gjb   ij φV  . . . , gia αab  ij , . . . , gjbαab   cid:17   −1  ,  ij   =  ×V , dμ =  ×d G   d i=1 dμv  ’  ’  dαab   cid:3   V v=1   cid:5   Haar,i   G  [ ia , jb ]  G   cid:3   ∞   5   with the same notation as in 4. This deﬁnes an embedding of elements of Hγ into HV . The same construction can be phrased in the ﬂux and spin representations. Moreover, the scalar product of two quantum states in HV associated in this way to the same graph agrees with the one computed in Hγ. This means that Hγ is embedded faithfully in HV . Obviously HV also contains states associated to open  cid:7  The physical picture behind HV is that of a ‘many-atom’ Hilbert space, with each ‘quantum gravity atom’ corresponding to a Hilbert space Hv = L2 ×d G An orthonormal basis ψ cid:7 χ  cid:2 g  in each Hv is given by the spin network wave func-  graphs, with links of open spin network vertices not glued to any other.   cid:6   G  .  tions for individual spin network vertices  labelled by spins and angular momentum projections associated to their d open edges, and intertwiner quantum numbers :  ,   cid:2 J,  cid:2 m,I   cid:2 χ =  → ψ cid:7 χ  cid:2 g  =  cid:8  cid:2 g cid:2 χ cid:9  =  DJa  mana ga   CJ1...Jd,I  n1..nd  .   6   +  d cid:17   a=1  HGF T =  The Hilbert space is then extended to include arbitrary numbers of QG atoms  HV and can be turned into the Fock space already introduced by  V =0  standard methods [16], introducing the fundamental GFT ﬁeld operators †  cid:7 χ ψ ˆϕ  ˆϕ g1, .., gd  ≡ ˆϕ  cid:2 g  =   g1, .., gd  ≡ ˆϕ †  ˆϕ cid:7 χ ψ cid:7 χ  cid:2 g     cid:2 g  =  † ˆϕ  ∗  cid:7 χ  cid:2 g   .   cid:8    cid:7 χ  Similarly, quantum observables can be turned from ﬁrst quantized operators  acting on the many-atom Hilbert spaces HV to second quantized operators on the Fock space, following again standard procedures.

Similarities and Diﬀerences with the LQG Hilbert Space  The kinematical Hilbert space of GFT is analogous to the one in LQG in the sense that its quantum states are the same type of functions on group manifolds, associ- ated to graphs, and characterized by the same representation labels, group or Lie algebra elements. Thus they also encode quantum gravity degrees of freedom in purely combinatorial and algebraic structures. However, there are also key diﬀer- ences. First of all, there is no embedding of GFT states into a continuous manifold, but they are associated to abstract graphs. This means that there is a priori no action of diﬀeomorphisms, nor knotting degrees of freedom. Thus they also diﬀer from the s-knot states of the diﬀeo-invariant Hilbert space of canonical LQG. The only symmetry follows from choice of quantum statistics, i.e. symmetry under per- mutations of vertex labelings. From this point of view, the GFT state space takes the combinatorial and algebraic nature of the degrees of freedom of quantum space to be fundamental, and no continuum intuition is assumed. In fact, there is no attempt to deﬁne a continuum limit at this kinematical level, if not in the sense of a limit of inﬁnite number of QG atoms  akin to a thermodynamic limit in con- densed matter . In particular, in contrast to Chapter 5, no cylindrical equivalence among GFT states is imposed, and, in contrast to Chapter 1, graph links labeled with trivial connection or zero representation label are not neglected  as atoms with zero momentum in condensed matter . Moreover, while GFT states associated to graphs with diﬀerent numbers of nodes are by deﬁnition orthogonal, GFT states associated to diﬀerent graphs with the same number of nodes are not, contrary to LQG states. One could say that graph structures are given less relevance than in standard LQG, because they are reduced to speciﬁc correlations among the funda- mental GFT quanta and quantum states for the same number of quanta but with diﬀerent correlations overlapping. At the same time, the physical relevance of graph structures is somewhat enhanced, because no link with spin zero is removed and be- cause the number of graph nodes is turned into a new physical observable. Thus we have similarities, but also diﬀerences. One motivation to accept these diﬀerences, drop some features of the LQG Hilbert space  e.g. those coming from a continuum embedding  and embrace the GFT one with its fundamental discreteness is that the latter has a clear Fock structure, giving direct meaning to the notion of ‘QG atom of quantum space’, and making powerful analytical tools available.

The Quantum Dynamics  Given the general set-up, one needs to specify a GFT model, that is: a group mani- fold, the valence d of the ﬁelds, and a set of kinetic and interaction terms, including their encoded combinatorial patterns. In quantum ﬁeld theory, given a topological space-time manifold, the ingredients selecting a speciﬁc model are: a locality prin- ciple, symmetries  which determine the ﬁeld content and the general theory space , simplicity, all well grounded in phenomenology. The renormalization group is then used as a check of consistency, and as a way to generate eﬀective dynamics at dif- ferent scales. In GFT, at present, the only type of ‘indirect phenomenology’ we can rely on is the current theories of spacetime and fundamental interactions, and the basic insights of other attempts at constructing a quantum theory of spacetime. Indeed, one can identify three main strategies, in the GFT literature, stemming from three main ways to approach the formalism, and three diﬀerent directions in quantum gravity research, all converging somehow to the GFT formalism.  3.1. GFT Dynamics from Canonical LQG  The ﬁrst is suggested by the picture of GFTs as second quantized theories of spin networks and of canonical LQG [16]. GFTs take seriously the basic insights of traditional LQG, based on canonical quantization of GR in the continuum, in par- ticular the same type of quantum states  even if not quite the same Hilbert space . Should we choose also the same dynamics, encoded in some Hamiltonian constraint operator, as in Chapter 2? One may say that it is not so reasonable to expect that the fundamental dynamics of space-time at the Planck scale  and maybe beyond  is obtained simply by the operator version of the GR dynamics. GR may be, after all, just an eﬀective theory, and indeed it is only tested at scales many orders of magnitude away from the Planckian. In fact, in GFTs many ingredients of the LQG state space, inspired directly from the continuum setting, are dropped. However, to derive a canonical quantum dynamics from the continuum classical dynamics is still a valid possibility, and conventional wisdom about eﬀective theories and running of scales may not apply in a background independent context. Indeed, even con- tinuum canonical LQG ends up with discrete, combinatorial, algebraic structures. One may then take these discrete structures as fundamental, and look for simplest deﬁnition of their dynamics, not necessarily taken from any continuum spacetime dynamics. Whatever route one decides to follow, if one has such a canonical opera- tor dynamics, the GFT reformulation of the same  deﬁning a speciﬁc GFT model  is straightforward, at least at a heuristic level.  tion’ operator  cid:26 P onto solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint equation, such that:  cid:26 FΨ cid:9  ≡  First of all, one has to ﬁnd the second quantized counterpart of the canonical dynamical operator.

Oriti  network vertices, weighted by coupling constants. This decomposition may well involve an inﬁnite number of components, to be restricted by symmetry conditions or physical considerations  e.g. renormalization group ﬂow . For each  n, m -body  component of  cid:26 P , we consider the matrix elements in a basis of single-vertex states as:  cid:26 FΨ cid:9  ≡  and construct the second quantized projector operator  choosing normal ordering   †  cid:7 χm Pn,m   cid:2 χ1, ...,  cid:2 χm,  cid:2 χ   cid:3   cid:2  1 ... ˆϕ cid:7 χ cid:2  n  ˆϕ cid:7 χ   cid:29   cid:8   †  cid:7 χ1... ˆϕ ˆϕ   cid:3  1, ...,  cid:2 χ  ∞ cid:8   λn,m  n  n,m  { cid:7 χ, cid:7 χ cid:2 }   cid:30    cid:8    cid:7 χ  −  † ˆϕ  cid:7 χ ˆϕ cid:7 χ  Ψ cid:9  = 0  Even given the above GFT operator, the identiﬁcation of the corresponding GFT action and partition function has to proceed in a rather heuristic manner. One would like to deﬁne a partition function Z for the canonical quantum LQG theory, that is for arbitrary states in the Fock space, thus arbitrary collections of spin network vertices  including those associated to closed graphs . The simplest choice would be an analog of the microcanonical ensemble, in which only states solving the canonical dynamical equation contribute: Zm = an arbitrary complete basis of states in the Hilbert  Fock  space of the quantum theory. The GFT dynamics  of existing GFT models , however, corresponds to a quantum LQG dynamics of a more general, grandcanonical type   cid:8 s δ  cid:26 F  s cid:9 , where s denotes  !  s  −   cid:11 F − μ  cid:11 N s cid:9    cid:8 se  ,  Zg =  where the sign of the chemical potential μ determines whether states with many or few spin network vertices are favored. To rewrite the above partition function as a GFT path integral, one introduces a basis of eigenstates of the GFT ﬁeld operator:  −   cid:11 F − μ  cid:11 N s cid:9  =  DϕDϕ e  − ϕ2  cid:8 ϕ e   cid:8   cid:8 se  Zg =  s  −   cid:11 F − μ  cid:11 N  ϕ cid:9  ≡ This is a GFT path integral with quantum amplitude e − Sef f where the eﬀective action Sef f is obtained from a classical action S0 as: e  −   cid:11 F − μ  cid:11 N  ϕ cid:9  − ϕ2  cid:8 ϕ e  .  Sef f  ϕ, ϕ  = S  ϕ, ϕ  + O  cid:2   =  .  Quantum corrections may amount to new interaction kernels or to a redeﬁnition of the coupling constants for the ones in S. For a given operator equation, then, the corresponding classical  and bare  GFT action is of the form:  S  ϕ, ϕ  = m2  ∗ d cid:2 g ϕ    cid:2 g  ϕ  cid:2 g  −  λn+m  [d cid:2 gi] [d cid:2 g    cid:2 g1 ...ϕ   cid:2 gm    cid:3  ∗ j] ϕ  ∗   cid:6   † cid:7    cid:5    cid:8   Vn+m   cid:2 g1, ...,  cid:2 gm,  cid:2 g  = Pn+m   cid:2 g1, ...,  cid:2 gm,  cid:2 g   cid:3  1, ...,  cid:2 g  n,m  cid:3  n  ϕ  cid:2 g   cid:3  1, ...,  cid:2 g   cid:3  n    cid:3  1 ...ϕ  cid:2 g   cid:3  n   Vn+m   cid:2 g1, ...,  cid:2 gm,  cid:2 g   cid:3  1, ...,  cid:2 g   cid:3  n    cid:8 ϕ cid:26 Fϕ cid:9   cid:8 ϕϕ cid:9  + O  cid:2    cid:29  cid:5    cid:30    cid:8   s   cid:5    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 133  Group Field Theory  133  so that the GFT interaction kernels  which, as we will see, are the spin foam vertex amplitudes  are nothing else than the matrix elements of the canonical projector operator, and a mass term incorporates the chemical potential.  As we stressed, the above is quite heuristic, as both the GFT path integral and the quantum statistical partition function of spin networks have to be properly de- ﬁned. The advantage of the GFT reformulation of the canonical LQG dynamics is exactly that, starting from the GFT partition function in terms of the classical GFT action, it allows to use QFT tools to deﬁne properly the quantum dynamics, as we will discuss. A few general facts are however clear from the above correspondence. The GFT formulation of a LQG dynamics stands with respect to it as the ﬁeld theory formulation of the dynamics of a many-body system with respect to its ﬁrst quantized formulation in terms of a Schr¨odinger equation for many-body wave func- tions. The former, one expects, is the best set-up to tackle issues involving large numbers of degrees of freedom of the system. Next, the quantum dynamics can obviously be studied perturbatively around the Fock vacuum  thus in terms of the spin foam expansion, as we will see , but this, as in standard QFT, is expected to be a good approximation of the full dynamics only for processes involving very few quantum geometric degrees of freedom, i.e. only for physical situations in which the physical vacuum of interest is well approximated by the perturbative Fock vacuum. Finally, the sector of the theory corresponding to solutions of the canonical Hamilto- nian constraint is the sub-sector of the full GFT quantum dynamics corresponding to a restriction to the micro canonical ensemble.  3.2. GFT Dynamics from Spin Foams Lattice Gravity Path Integrals  The above strategy for the deﬁnition of GFT models, starting directly from a canon- ical quantum dynamics, has not been followed until now. The main strategy that has been followed starts from the deﬁnition of spin foam amplitudes [13] discussed in Chapter 3, but now encoding them in a GFT model. This has been mainly done in a simplicial context [1]  but see [15] .  Working in the simplicial complex means that one chooses d equal to the would-be space-time dimension, interprets the GFT ﬁelds  i.e. the quanta they create annihilate  as  d − 1 -simplices  quantum tetrahedra in d = 4 , with the arguments of the GFT ﬁelds attached to their  d − 2 -faces. Next, one usually re- stricts possible interactions to a single one, describing d + 1 such simplices glued pairwise across their faces to form  the boundary of  a d-simplex. The kinetic term describes the gluing of two such d-simplices across a shared  d − 1 -simplex  the GFT quantum being propagated from one interaction vertex to the next . With this combinatorics, one has a general action   cid:5   SGF T =  [dgi][dg  λ  +   d + 1 !   cid:5    cid:3  i  ϕ g   gi K  gi, g   cid:3  ∗ i] ϕ [dgij] ϕ g1j ....ϕ g d+1 j V  gij  + c c.   cid:3  i    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 134  134  D. Oriti  The GFT Feynman diagrams are then 2-complexes dual to  the 2-skeleta of  sim- plicial complexes. The GFT perturbative expansion will then give a prescription for summing over such complexes, weighted by quantum amplitudes. The 2-complex corresponding to each Feynman diagram is a collection of vertices connected by links, in turn bounding 2-cells. Each GFT interaction kernel assigns an amplitude to each vertex of such 2-complex, while the GFT propagator gives an amplitude to each link of the same, and encodes a prescription for connecting the variables entering the vertex amplitude to the ones appearing in the amplitude of a neigh- boring vertex. The complete Feynman amplitude for the 2-complex is obtained by summing over common variables in vertex amplitudes and propagators. Now, the vertex amplitude V corresponding to a given GFT model is nothing else than the spin foam vertex amplitude characterizing a given spin foam model, and the spin foam model is itself fully speciﬁed by the whole GFT Feynman amplitude. This correspondence between spin foam models and GFTs is one to one and fully generic [1, 12]: for any given spin foam model, there is a GFT model such that the spin foam amplitudes are reproduced as Feynman amplitudes, and any GFT model deﬁnes a spin foam model in its perturbative expansion. Thus any procedure for deﬁning a spin foam model gives automatically a deﬁnition of a GFT model. Notice that, just like the spin foam amplitudes can be recast in diﬀerent forms, there is a certain freedom in a GFT model to redeﬁne kinetic and interaction terms, while maintaining the same expression for the whole Feynman amplitudes. These ampli- tudes can be written, just as the GFT ﬁeld itself and the GFT action, in diﬀerent variables: group elements, Lie algebra elements or group representations. In terms of group elements, the  spin foam  amplitudes take the form of lattice gauge the- ories [11–13, 24, 25], the lattice being the 2-complex. In Lie algebra variables, the amplitudes take the form of discrete gravity path integrals on the same lattice  or on the dual triangulation  [20, 26]. In group representations, the amplitudes take the standard spin foam form [13].  In the simplicial context, spin foam constructions in 4d have followed one main route [1, 13]. This amounts to imposing constraints on classical variables, quantum states and quantum amplitudes  written in discrete path integral or spin foam form  for 4d BF theory with group SL 2, C  or Spin 4  discretized on a given simplicial complex. The constraints are the discretized version of the simplicity constraints that turn the BF dynamics into the gravitational one in the continuum [13, 27].  The constrained spin foam amplitudes become equivalently discrete path inte- grals for Plebanski gravity [26]. Moreover, the simplicity constraints amount also to a restriction in the decomposition of the representations of SL 2, C  or Spin 4  into representations of the diagonal SU  2  subgroup, allowing a link with canonical LQG. The crucial issue becomes of course the correct discretization and quantum implementation of the simplicity constraints, which is where speciﬁc models diﬀer. This route can be followed directly at the GFT level, by imposing constraints on the GFT ﬁelds, representing, we recall, quantum tetrahedra. To illustrate the   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 135  Group Field Theory  135   cid:3  i    cid:3  i  ϕ g  5 cid:17   i cid:7 =j,i,j=1   cid:5    cid:5   +  λ 5!  resulting GFT models, we give two examples in the Riemannian setting including the Barbero-Immirzi parameter γ  in the Lorentzian setting less is known and at present we only have one model, with minor variations: the Engle-Pereira-Rovelli- Livine  EPRL  model [28] or the BC model [29], depending on whether the Barbero- Immirzi parameter is included or not . The same models can be straightforwardly extended to combinatorial settings more general than the simplicial one [15, 30], but the geometric features of such generalized constructions are not yet fully understood. The ﬁrst example is the version of the EPRL model [13, 28], resulting from a speciﬁc choice of imposing the constraints in the representation variables, and only at the level of the GFT kinetic term:  SEPRL  GFT =  [dgi] [dg   gi  C   cid:3  ∗ i] ϕ  −1  gi, g  [dgij] ϕ g1j ....ϕ g5j   δ gij, gji  + cc .   cid:4  cid:5   cid:4   dh±dh   cid:3  ±   cid:30    cid:8    cid:3  4 cid:17   + i ,j  j  i ,Ji∈N 2 −  i=1  where the interaction term is the same as in BF models and simply identiﬁes the Spin 4  group arguments of the GFT ﬁelds according to the combinatorics of faces in a 4-simplex, while the kinetic term is determined by:  CEPRL  gi, g   cid:5   cid:17    cid:3  i  =   cid:29  4 cid:17    cid:3   dui  i  i=1  dj+  i  dj  − i  dJi δ1−γj+  i , 1+γ j  − i  δJi,j+  − i +j i   cid:4    cid:3   + i  χj   cid:3  g+ +  i h+ui h  −1 g   cid:2  + i    −1  − i  χj  −  cid:3  i h−ui h −  g  −1 g   cid:2 − i    −1  χJi  ui   ,  where all the integrals are over SU  2 , the Spin 4  group elements are decomposed − into their selfdual anti-selfdual components,  j + i   label irreducible unitary rep- resentations of Spin 4 , while Ji label irreps of the diagonal SU  2  subgroup, and χ are the representation characters; here γ has to be a rational number. A second example is the version of the Baratin-Oriti  BO  model [26] resulting from a speciﬁc choice of imposing the constraints in Lie algebra  ﬂux  variables, again only in the kinetic term:  i , j  SBO  GFT =  [dgi] [dg   cid:3  i]dkdk   cid:3   ∗ ϕ   gi; k  C  −1  gi, k; g   cid:3  i, k    ϕ g   cid:3    cid:3  i; k     [dgij] [dkj]ϕ g1j; k1 ....ϕ g5j; k5   δ gij, gji  + c.c.  with the same BF interaction term, and an additional set of variables ki ∈ S3  cid:6   SU  2 , interpreted as unit normals to the tetrahedra, introduced to ensure the covariant imposition of the constraints, while the kinetic term is determined by: − − i h−  x i    cid:26   CBO  gi, k; g  i h+  x+  [dxi][dyi]  i  Eg   cid:3  i, k  Eg+    =  −1  dh  dh   cid:2 ±  ±  k  k  δ   cid:3    cid:3    cid:5    cid:5    cid:6   i k−1  βx+ δ−kx −  i    cid:26  δ−x+  i   y+  i  δ−x − i   y   cid:2 + i h   cid:2 + y+  i  Eg   cid:2 − i h   cid:2 −  y   cid:30   − i     cid:3   5 cid:17   i cid:7 =j,i,j=1   cid:7  cid:17    cid:29   i  − i    cid:26  Eg   cid:5    cid:5   +  λ 5!

This second model can easily be written down in group variables only  carrying out the Lie algebra integrations .     These choices of GFT action give rise to two diﬀerent spin foam models, as the corresponding Feynman amplitudes are diﬀerent. The general properties of the GFT deﬁnition of the spin foam models are the same, though: the spin foam amplitudes associated to a given spin foam 2-complex  or dual triangulation  are completed by a sum over complexes of any topology, generated perturbatively with the canonical combinatorial weights of a ﬁeld theory, depending on the coupling constants and on the symmetry group of each complex, as in 2. They can be equivalently expressed in group variables  where they take the form of lattice gauge theories , Lie algebra variables  where they take the form of simplicial gravity path integrals  or group representations. This formulation of the quantum gravity dynamics is covariant, and it incorporates topology change in a very natural way. It is a form of discrete 3rd quantization of gravity, and a peculiar type of discrete realization of gravitational path integral, combining both sum over lattices as in dynamical triangulations [8], and a sum over discrete geometric data for each given triangulation, like in quantum Regge calculus [6]. Combined with the direct  heuristic  link between a GFT model and a canonical operator dynamics, the GFT encoding of spin foam models allows to link them directly with the canonical theory.  The ‘spin foam’ strategy is quite satisfactory from the point of view of encod- ing discrete geometry and making contact with discretized gravity. However, it leaves the deﬁnition of the theory space, e.g. the set of possible interactions that can should be included in the theory, rather ambiguous. One could consider adding more interaction terms with diﬀerent combinatorics, for example, not to mention that the same strategy of constraining BF theory could be extended to formula- tions of gravity more general than the Holst-Palatini one. One possible attitude toward these issues is to rely on the fundamental nature of simplicial geometry and on the renormalization group. One could argue that simplicial structures can be considered the most basic type of lattices on which to discretize geometry, and that one has to simply start from the simplest GFT action ensuring geometricity of the simplicial structures it generates, and then run the quantum dynamics and the renormalization group to generate all possible interactions compatible with that at diﬀerent scales, the only constraint being renormalizability. Still, one may want to have a more principled deﬁnition of the GFT theory space [23], resting on basic assumptions, some GFT counterpart of QFT axiomatics.

GFT Dynamics from Tensorial Axiomatics     dg U  g  [dgi]U  g  U  gi, ˜gi  = δ g  1, g1 ··· U  g  cid:3   ×d, like: ϕ g1, .., gd  →    This leads to a third strategy for the construction of GFT models. It partly stems from the search for a good notion of locality for GFTs by extending the basic fea- tures of matrix models for 2d quantum gravity [5] to higher dimensions, stressing the interpretation of GFTs as  richer  tensor models [14]. First, to be able to in- terpret the GFT ﬁeld as a proper tensor, one has to deﬁne a transformation under  cid:3  d, gd  ϕ g1, ..., gd , a unitary group U  cid:3   cid:3  ∗ for i, ˜gi , which in turn requires the d arguments of the i, gi  GFT ﬁeld to be labelled. Given the tensorial transformation property, one can deﬁne tensor invariant interactions corresponding to invariant convolutions Ib of polyno- mials of GFT ﬁelds. Such invariants are indexed by colored d-graphs B constructed as follows: for each GFT ﬁeld  resp. its complex conjugate  draw a white  resp. black  node with d outgoing links each labelled by d diﬀerent colors, then connect all links with one another following the two conditions that a white  resp. black  node can only be connected to a black  resp. white  node and that only links with the same color can be connected. For real ﬁelds, one has a similar deﬁnition involv- ing orthogonal transformations. This is the tensor invariance property generalizing the invariance of matrix models  d = 2 , whose interactions can only be traces of matrix polynomials, replacing the notion of locality of usual QFT. This suggests a GFT theory space with arbitrary tensor invariant interactions and a kinetic term which may instead break the invariance  again, as in usual QFT :  SGF T =  [dgi] [dg   cid:3  ∗ i] ϕ   gi K  gi, g   cid:3  i  ϕ g   cid:3  i  +  ∗ tbIb ϕ, ϕ      7    cid:5    cid:8   b∈B  where tb are the coupling constants corresponding to the various tensor invariant interactions. The use of tensor invariant interactions has a very nice property at the topological level. The Feynman diagrams of such GFTs can be represented as  d + 1 -colored graphs, in which the d-colored graphs representing interactions are of course associated to vertices of the diagrams and an extra color is associated to the lines of propagation of the GFT ﬁeld.  d + 1 -colored graphs are in one to one correspondence with simplicial d-manifolds with at most conical singularities [14]. These topological properties give an additional motivation to follow this third strategy, while one has also to notice that, up to now, this strategy has oﬀered less indications in the choice of ﬁeld content and of kinetic interaction kernels.  The same topological considerations show also an interesting link between mod- els based on simplicial interactions and tensor invariant models. Starting from simplicial interactions, one notices that the data in a GFT Feynman diagram are suﬃcient to determine a 2-complex dual to a simplicial complex, but not to specify the full homology of the same complex, in particular the k-cells for k < d − 2. This is a problem, in particular if one wants to understand the symmetry properties of the amplitudes associated to the same Feynman diagrams [17, 31]. A solution to this problem [14, 18] is to add colors to simplicial GFTs. Instead of working with a   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 138  138  D. Oriti  single d-valent GFT ﬁeld, one uses d+1 such ﬁelds ϕa, and their complex conjugates, labelled by a color index a = 1, .., d + 1, with a kinetic term for each of them, and a single simplicial interaction involving a convolution of all of them, one for each  d − 1 -simplex in a d-simplex, plus the complex conjugate of the same interaction. Feynman diagrams will again be  d + 1 -colored graphs, representing the 1-skeletal of simplicial pseudo-manifolds. Moreover [32], starting from such colored simplicial models and integrating out all but one of the GFT ﬁelds, one is left with a theory of a single GFT ﬁeld with interactions indexed by colored d-graphs B. This intriguing connection deserves to be further explored.  3.4. GFT Symmetries  Still, much remains to be understood about basic principles determining the GFT theory space. In particular, one would like to understand more about GFT sym- metries. For GFTs aiming at quantum gravity, one would like to understand better especially the role of diﬀeomorphisms. Here as well there are three main lines of attack, obviously not exclusive, corresponding to the three GFT construction strategies above. Coming from the canonical theory, one would make sure that some Hamiltonian  and spatial diﬀeo  constraint operator is encoded in the quan- tum GFT dynamics by construction, and look for the sector in which only quantum states satisfying the corresponding operator equations are relevant. This route has not been followed up to now, if not indirectly via the spin foam route. Following the spin foam or discrete gravity route, one would ﬁrst look for some discrete counter- part of diﬀeo symmetry satisﬁed by the GFT Feynman amplitudes, and then look for the ﬁeld-theoretic deﬁnition of the same at the GFT level. Simplicial diﬀeos have been studied in both discrete gravity [33] and topological spin foam models [34], and their GFT counterpart has been identiﬁed [17]. This turns out to be a global quan- tum group symmetry, at the GFT level, and leads naturally to the same discrete WdW-like equation and recursion relations seen also at the spin foam level [35]. However, these simplicial diﬀeos are broken by the simplicity constraints, leaving open the issue of recovering them in a suitable approximation of gravitational 4d GFT models. A third complementary strategy follows again the insights of matrix models. There [5], the Virasoro algebra is found from a set of constraints satisﬁed by the partition function, in turn following from the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the n-point functions associated to loop observables. The latter can also be directly related to the Wheeler DeWitt equation of 2d Liouville gravity corresponding to the continuum limit of the same matrix models. An analogous result is found in simple tensor models [14, 36], for a generalization of the Witt algebra. However, we still miss the link between this symmetry algebra and higher-dimensional dif- feomorphisms, and we need to generalize these results to GFTs with interesting quantum geometric data. In general, the treatment of GFT symmetries as in stan- dard QFTs  Noether theorem, Ward identities, symmetry breaking  needs to be better developed [37].

The Continuum Limit of Quantum Geometry in GFT  GFTs give a picture of space-time as fundamentally discrete: the fundamental de- grees of freedom that  should  make up space-time are GFT quanta  simplices or spin nets vertices , as brought to the forefront by the second quantized formulation, and their dynamical processes are the GFT Feynman diagrams, themselves cellular complexes replacing a smooth space-time manifold. Further, if the group manifold is chosen to be SU  2  or another compact group, one obtains an additional dis- creteness of quantum geometric spectra, such as areas and volumes, as in standard LQG.  Still, our conventional description of gravity and space-time is in terms of a con- tinuum ﬁeld theory, general relativity, based on a smooth metric ﬁeld on a smooth manifold  it is in this sense that the Regge geometries found in GFT Feynman am- plitudes, which are continuous but piecewise ﬂat, thus singular, are not enough . To reconcile this description with the one provided by GFTs is the problem of extracting an eﬀective continuum description for the GFT degrees of freedom.  4.1. Clarifying the Nature of the Problem  Before we move on to discuss this area of GFT research, we would like to emphasize the diﬀerence with the problem of the classical limit. By continuum approximation in this context we mean a regime in which a large number of  interacting  funda- mental degrees of freedom, i.e. GFT quanta, are considered, possibly in terms of some collective variables  and with additional physical constraints . By classical approximation we mean the regime in which the quantum nature of the same de- grees of freedom  few or many  can be neglected. The two limits are diﬀerent, do not need to commute at all, and have to be explored independently. In particular, it could well be that the quantum nature of the fundamental degrees of freedom is actually needed to achieve the correct continuum eﬀective physics, i.e. the classi- cal approximation may have to be taken after the continuum approximation. From this perspective, the semiclassical approximations in spin foam models [13]  e.g. the asymptotic analysis, showing dominance of Regge geometries for each spin foam 2- complex  and canonical LQG  e.g. coherent states peaking on discrete classical geometric data for any given spin network graph [38] , however interesting, do not ensure the existence of the right continuum limit, and may even not select the right conﬁgurations to consider to reach it. The continuum limit in GFTs is rather to be understood in analogy with the thermodynamical limit in usual QFTs  e.g. in condensed matter  as the regime of  formally  inﬁnite fundamental atoms and of various cut-oﬀs being  formally  removed.  The problem of the continuum in GFT can then be articulated in four main related aspects. One is the perturbative renormalizability of GFT models. The second is the study of their phase structure. The third is their non-perturbative, constructive deﬁnition. The fourth is the extraction of eﬀective continuum physics   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 140  140  D. Oriti  from them, in the appropriate regime. We will discuss the last, more physical issue in the next section. Here we will deal with the ﬁrst three, more formal issues.  In order to appreciate further their relevance, let us ﬁrst discuss what role these aspects of GFTs play from the point of view of canonical LQG and of spin foam mod- els. Both GFT renormalizability and constructibility are simply equivalent to the requirement of GFT models be  non-perturbatively  well-deﬁned. As such, they are a re-phrasing of the requirement of having a well-deﬁned dynamical constraint op- erator. Another issue concerning the deﬁnition of the canonical constraint operator is that of quantization ambiguities discussed in Chapter 2. These have been related to the issue of renormalizability in perturbative QG [39], and its GFT counterpart is again GFT renormalizability. Even if the theory was well-deﬁned mathematically, important physical questions would remain: what is the ﬂow of eﬀective quantum dynamics across scales? what is the continuum phase structure? These issues are crucial both in the canonical and in the covariant setting. They can be tackled very eﬀectively in the GFT formalism, thanks to the QFT setting, while it is not so clear  given the experience with the same issues in many-body quantum theory  that they can be tackled as eﬀectively remaining in the canonical operator formalism. As for the spin foam context, if the spin foam expansion is understood as arising from expansion of canonical evolution operator, the problem is to make sense of this expansion, i.e. to deﬁne the canonical evolution operator rigorously, and becomes again the issue of ﬁnding a constructive deﬁnition of the GFT partition function. If spin foams are understood as lattice gravity path integrals, the problem of the con- tinuum translates into the issue of reﬁning coarse graining them, and identify the ﬂow of eﬀective dynamics and its ﬁxed points [25]. That is, the same problems that GFT recasts in QFT language by turning the same lattice gravity path integrals into Feynman amplitudes. Regardless of the precise point of view one takes about spin foam models, one thing is clear: there is simply no spin foam theory without a prescription of how to deal with spin foam amplitudes on diﬀerent complexes. In other words, a complete deﬁnition of a spin foam theory is not simply the set of all possible spin foam amplitudes for all possible spin foam complexes, and relational physics is not to be extracted simply by choosing some given spin foam complex, adapted to the situation at hand. Rather, a complete deﬁnition is given by: this set of complexes plus a precise organization principle, a procedure to relate the amplitudes for diﬀerent complexes. Because the set of all complexes has to include the ones made of inﬁnite numbers of cells links faces  to account for an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom , this becomes the problem of deﬁning the continuum limit. A formal deﬁnition of such organization principle speciﬁes a formal deﬁnition of the theory, to be made rigorous. This principle could be a reﬁnement limit [25] discussed in Chapter 6, or a prescription for summing over complexes. The latter could be chosen arbitrarily, but this introduces a further huge ambiguity. Rather, it should be selected by an appropriate set of principles  maybe motivated by the canonical perspective [21] . The GFT formalism provide exactly such prescription,   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 141  Group Field Theory  141  a natural and clear organization principle for spin foam amplitudes, and for deﬁning their continuum limit.  4.2. A Survey of Current Research  In pursuing the issue of renormalizability and constructibility of GFTs, the input from tensor models has proven crucial. In fact one main obstacle towards making sense of the continuum limit of GFTs is to control the sum over triangulations spin foam 2-complexes they generate, which are much more intricate than standard QFT Feynman diagrams. Progress has been made, thanks to developments in tensor models. The introduction of colors [14, 18] gave control over the combinatorics and topology of GFT Feynman diagrams, and over their sum. One important result has been the understanding of the large-N limit of tensor models  where N is the size of the tensors  and topological GFTs  where N is the cut-oﬀ in representations  [40], which are the starting point for the construction of most 4d gravity models. It has been shown that the leading order in N corresponds to melonic diagrams [14, 32, 41], which are dual to triangulations of spheres with a peculiar combinatorial structure [14].  GFT renormalization started being tackled in [42] and is, since then, a very ac- tive research area [43]. Next to the mentioned combinatorial aspects, this involves a deeper understanding of the scaling of amplitudes in the large-N limit. Indeed, the large-N regime is the regime of many GFT degrees of freedom  for given combi- natorics . From this point of view it represent the analog of the UV regime in usual QFTs. Conversely, the low-N regime would be the analog of the IR regime. Con- sistently with this picture, it is in this large-N regime that divergences in spin foam amplitudes are usually found. However, the geometric interpretation associated to it is not totally clear. Large spins in SU  2  spin foam models correspond to large areas and volumes for the discrete structures they are based on, consistently with the quantum geometry of canonical LQG. From the point of view of simplicial geom- etry, then, the geometric notion of UV IR is rather the opposite of the formal QFT one. Still, much caution should be exercised in interpreting in geometric terms the algebraic data and discrete structures of GFTs  and spin foams , before a proper continuum limit is established and we control how such data map to continuum geometric ones. Still, one can proceed guided only by the mathematical behavior of GFT amplitudes. Their scaling with N is the ﬁrst thing that has been studied, with focus on  colored  topological models, in particular showing the suppression of singular topologies [44]. Still in the context of topological GFTs, remarkable calcu- lations of radiative corrections were performed [45], and one interesting implication was that, in order to achieve renormalizability, these models need to be augmented by a kinetic term given by the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the group manifold   cid:5   d cid:8   i=1  ∗  [dgi] ϕ   gi   ΔGi ϕ gi   .   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 142  142  D. Oriti  While its quantum geometric meaning is still unclear, this is indeed a natural choice of kinetic term, and it has been later shown to make topological models superrenor- malizable  at least in the Abelian case  [43]. Similar, and much more challenging computations have to be performed in a more systematic way in the context of 4d gravity models. While the BC model is super-renormalizable as well, at least for special choices of edge amplitudes [11, 29], little is known about models in- corporating the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, like the EPRL and BO models. The simplest radiative corrections of the EPRL model have been investigated in [28] and, much more thoroughly, in [46] , and are similarly dependent on the details of edge weights.  While these calculations are technically impressive and important, one would like a more systematic analysis of perturbative renormalizability, which in turn re- quires more control on the theory space. Indeed, up to now this type of systematic analysis has been carried out only in simpliﬁed models characterized by tensor in- variant interactions and the mentioned Laplacian-type kinetic term  this class of models has been dubbed tensorial GFTs . While the use of tensor invariant inter- actions provides a notion of locality, the Laplacian term gives a clear notion of scale  indexed by its eigenvalues, i.e. by group representations, as expected from LQG and spin foam models . This allows to apply to the more involved GFT context the rigorous multi scale renormalization analysis of conventional QFTs. Results have been piling up rapidly. After the identiﬁcation of several renormalizable mod- els in various dimensions [43], the investigation of models incorporating the gauge invariance conditions characterizing topological GFT models  and crucial also for gravitational models in 4d  has started, and renormalizable models of the Abelian type were identiﬁed ﬁrst [43, 47]. Lately, a non-Abelian GFT model with gauge in- variance and interactions up to order six, extending the Boulatov model to include a Laplacian term, was also shown to be renormalizable [48]. This type of analysis is highly non-trivial, due again to the intricacies of cellular complexes, requiring an extension or adaptation of several notions and tools from standard renormalization theory: the notion of Wick ordering, the notion of connectedness and of 1-particle irreducibility, that of contraction of high subgraphs, using tools from crystallization theory such as dipole moves. The stage is now set for a similar systematic analysis of gravitational GFT models in 4d, incorporating also simplicity constraints. A renor- malizability result in this context, for models of the EPRL or BO type, would be of paramount importance for the whole ﬁeld of quantum gravity. Renormalizability  or perturbative ﬁniteness, which is nicer in some respect but more problematic in others, as it makes it harder to identify the relevant channels of interactions at dif- ferent scales  would imply that the given GFT model is perturbatively well-deﬁned, as a QFT. It would represent a truly background independent and renormalizable quantum  ﬁeld  theory of spacetime. Given that how spin foam models arise in GFT, perturbative GFT renormalizability would also give meaning to the spin foam sum over complexes.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 143  Group Field Theory  143  The renormalization group also determines the ﬂow of eﬀective GFT dynamics across scales, and helps us to map out the phase structure of the theory. Detailed calculations of the beta functions for various tensorial GFTs have been performed [49], including non-Abelian ones [50]. While establishing general conclusions is very tricky [50], the argument can be made for asymptotic freedom  or safety  being rather generic in GFTs. Asymptotic freedom would of course be welcome news for GFT models of quantum gravity because it would conﬁrm their being well-deﬁned as QFTs. It would also suggest the existence of phase transitions at some point during the ﬂow towards small values of N , i.e. small values of group representations, due to a corresponding growth in the GFT coupling constants. One powerful tool to study such ﬂow, mapping out the GFT phase diagram, is the so-called Functional Renormalization Group. An extension of the FRG to matrix models has been developed [51], and the ﬁrst deﬁnition and application of the FRG to tensorial GFTs has been provided recently [52]. Beside making available this powerful tool, it allowed to obtain interesting information about ﬁxed points and the phase diagram of simple GFT models at both large and small N , and the ﬁrst indications of a phase transition between a phase characterized  in mean ﬁeld  by a vanishing GFT ﬁeld, and a ‘condensed’ phase with non-vanishing expectation value of the same. The possible physical relevance of this scenario will be discussed in the next section.  The analysis of GFT phase transitions is in its infancy. The only other result is the proof of existence of a phase transition for any topological  BF  model in any dimension, in the melonic sector [53]. More is known in tensor models. Here the problem is tackled by explicit resummation of the partition function, in the appropriate regime, i.e. from a statistical rather than ﬁeld-theoretic point of view. For both i.i.d. and dually weighted models, the critical behavior of the melonic sector as well as of subdominant orders  including a rigorous double scaling limit  has been studied, with explicit calculation of the critical behavior [32, 41] [54]. Once more, work on simpler models may pave the way for the analysis of GFTs.  Results on GFTs should be compared with analogous results in canonical LQG and in the lattice gravity approach to spin foam models. In the canonical setting, these issues have not been much explored, though, and what we know at present is only that inequivalent kinematical representations of the holonomy-ﬂux algebra exist, beyond the Ashtekar Lewandowski one [55, 56]. Also, work on GFT renor- malization should be carefully compared with renormalization of spin foam models treated as lattice gauge theories [25]. In fact, the same procedures of subtraction of subgraphs, adopted to establish perturbative GFT renormalizability, can be seen as lattice coarse graining procedure, from a diﬀerent perspective.  To conclude, we mention results on constructive aspects of GFTs, aiming at a non-perturbative deﬁnition of GFTs, i.e. the ‘summability’ of the perturbative series  it is not going to be convergent, in general . The summability in the melonic  large- N  sector and of subdominant orders, all involving complexes of trivial topology,   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 144  144  D. Oriti  has been already discussed. Interesting results have been obtained also on the Borel summability of the whole GFT partition function for topological models [57], and these results, although their physical meaning is yet to be explored, are remarkable because they amount to being able to sum over all cellular topologies generated by the GFT perturbative expansion. More remains to be done, and once more results on constructive tensor models [58] will be an important reference.  5. Extracting Eﬀective Continuum Physics from GFTs  5.1. A Physical Perspective on the Continuum and on Phase  Transitions in GFT  As mentioned, the crucial problem for any background independent quantum the- ory of gravity is to recover classical GR on a smooth manifold in the continuum and classical limit. Many results have been obtained in the canonical setting as well as in spin foams  and in Regge calculus , e.g. on semiclassical states and asymptotic analyses of spin foam amplitudes. Most of them are immediate to import in GFT, since GFT is a reformulation of canonical LQG and a complete encoding of spin foams. These are signiﬁcant assets. However, the important points we have already mentioned in the previous section should not be forgotten: ﬁrst, the classical ap- proximation is independent and possibly secondary to the continuum one; second, simple graphs lattices  few degrees of freedom  could be useful to capture some lim- ited information of continuum geometry and physics, in very special regimes, but eﬀective continuum physics requires the limit of formally inﬁnite number of funda- mental degrees of freedom. This is also the reason why recent attempts to compute eﬀective continuum physics using only spin foam amplitudes [59] are problematic from the GFT point of view: they are conﬁned to a regime, associated to simple spin foam 2-complexes  the perturbative GFT regime at the lowest order , and to a class of states, simple spin network graphs  very few GFT quanta , very far from the non-perturbative, approximately continuum sector of the theory, and instead too close to the regime of fully degenerate geometry  GFT Fock vacuum . They give important insights, but the GFT perspective suggests that something diﬀerent is needed.  Let us clarify. The GFT formulation of LQG and spin foam models provides tools to deal with many QG degrees of freedom, i.e. to control the superposition of states and amplitudes associated to diﬀerent, reﬁned lattices, just like in condensed matter systems the QFT language is useful to control many-particle physics and to extract eﬀective dynamics from it. Like QFTs in condensed matter, one can deal with the GFT dynamics perturbatively, i.e. in its spin foam expansion. However, this should be expected to be the right language only as long as few degrees of free- dom are involved, i.e. close to perturbative GFT vacuum. In turn this perturbative vacuum is physically a ‘no-space state’, degenerate in geometry and topology. One would expect non-degenerate geometries and eﬀective continuum physics to arise   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 145  Group Field Theory  145  far from such vacuum state and close to a diﬀerent non-perturbative vacuum  a dif- ferent phase  of the theory. This expectation is consistent with the canonical LQG picture, where the kinematical Ashtekar-Lewandowski vacuum is geometrically de- generate, and simple spin network excitations around it are not enough to generate a smooth geometry. There are two interpretations one could give to this ‘need for a new, geometric phase’. The ﬁrst treats this as a purely formal requirement, as simply implying that the theory is only physical in one appropriate phase  i.e. for the appropriate range of parameters , but with no meaning attached to other phases of the theory or to the phase transitions between them. This is of course a conceptually consistent picture and, for what we know, could be the right one  it is, for example, the picture behind most work on the dynamical triangulations approach to quantum gravity [8] . A second interpretation, however, could also be put forward. It supposes that the other phases of the system may have a physical existence as well, even though they happen not to describe our current geometric regime of physical universe. In this view, the transition between phases may also have physical meaning, that is it could correspond itself to a physical process of the quantum gravity building blocks of space-time. More speciﬁcally, one could suggest that the phase transition to the geometric phase is what replaces the big bang singularity and describes the ‘origin’ of our physical universe. Thus, one has a cosmological interpretation for the GFT phase transition to a non-degenerate, geometric non-perturbative GFT vacuum. This hypothesis is dubbed ‘geometroge- nesis’ [60]. While the search for such phase transition at the more rigorous level continues as summarized in the previous section, it is worth exploring possible concrete scenarios for it in GFT, aiming for a more direct extraction of possible physical consequences, and better physical insights into the formalism. This also means exploring candidates for the new vacua. A further hypothesis can then be put forward: our geometric universe could be born from a condensation of quan- tum space atoms [22]. This would realize explicitly in the GFT setting the idea of space-time as a condensate and of an emergent universe, often discussed in the context of analog gravity models [61, 62].  5.2. Some Recent Results  Thus one turns the attention to a special class of states within the GFT Hilbert space: GFT condensates [63], i.e. quantum states characterized by a macroscopic occupation number for some given quantum observable [64], and involving a super- position of an arbitrary number of GFT quanta. In the simplest case, these are such that all the GFT quanta are in the same quantum state. One can show [63], using results in LQG and discrete gravity, that such condensate states, provided geometricity conditions  e.g. simplicity constraints  are imposed in the quantum dynamics, admit an interpretation as continuum homogeneous spaces, of the type used in cosmology. They are quantum states of the full theory, but they are charac- terized by a collective wave function depending only on the quantum geometric data   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 146  146  D. Oriti   cid:5   associated to homogeneous anisotropic geometries. This characterization still leaves room for a variety of constructions [63, 65, 66], but the simplest condensate state one  the GFT analog of the Gross-Pitaevskii ansatz for Bose-Einstein condensates :  σ cid:9  := N  σ  exp  ˆσ 0 cid:9  with ˆσ :=   8  where σ kg1, . . . , kg4  = σ g1, . . . , g4 ∀k ∈ Spin 4  or SL 2, C , and N  σ  is a nor- malization factor, is already very interesting. This state is quite special, as it is a coherent state for the GFT ﬁeld operator: ˆϕ gI  σ cid:9  = σ gI  σ cid:9 , and using it as   g1, . . . , g4   †  dg 4 σ g1, . . . , g4  ˆϕ  a  coarse grained  proxy of the true vacuum state is a sort of mean ﬁeld approx- imation. Inserting this ansatz for the vacuum state of the theory in the quantum dynamics, that is in the Schwinger-Dyson equations, and making some further ap- proximations, one gets an eﬀective equation for the collective wave function σ [63]:  i] ˜K g1, . . . , g4, g  cid:3    cid:3  1, . . . , g   cid:3  4 σ g   cid:3  1, . . . , g   cid:3  4  + λ  [dg  δ ˜V[ϕ, ϕ ∗  ]  δ ¯ϕ g1, . . . , g4   ϕ→σ,ϕ∗→σ∗ = 0 .   cid:5    cid:27  cid:27  cid:27   which is nothing else than the classical equation of motion of the initial GFT model, up to any additional approximation needed to ensure consistency of the interpreta- tion  symbolized by the˜on the dynamical kernels . Given the interpretation of the collective wave function σ as a distribution over the space of continuum homoge- neous geometries, this equation represents a non-linear extension of the WdW-like equation of loop quantum cosmology [67]. Extended quantum cosmology equations of this type have been previously suggested in [68, 69]. The crucial point is that such quantum cosmology equation is here derived from the fundamental theory, for a suitable class of states, and no minisuperspace reduction is carried out  it should be compared with similar approaches, like [70] ; rather,  generalized  quantum cos- mology emerges from the fundamental dynamics as a kind of hydrodynamics ap- proximation. This derivation matches the general expectations we discussed about the continuum approximation of the theory and phase transitions. Moreover, the derivation is completely general  for 4d gravity models with geometricity condi- tions , and it applies for any choice of fundamental GFT  thus LQG spin foam  dynamics, encoded in the GFT kernels K and V. A simple example correspond- ing to using the Laplacian operator as K and neglecting the GFT interaction, for both Lorentzian and Riemannian gravity, also incorporating a massless scalar ﬁeld, already shows how a semi-classical Friedmann equation could be obtained by such methods [63, 71]. Similar results hold [63] for diﬀerent choices of GFT condensate states.  This equation can also be written down in terms of expectation values of the col- lective operators corresponding to cosmological variables [72]. A natural canonical pair, in terms of which one should try to write any eﬀective semiclassical cosmo- logical dynamics in a GFT setting, is given by  the expectation value of  the total ﬂux ˆbi and Newton’s constants , from which geometric quantities like macroscopic areas   κ is a combination of Planck’s  †  dg 4 ˆϕ   cid:7  cid:27  cid:27  cid:27   I = iκ   gJ   d  dt ˆϕ  τ i I t      cid:7    cid:6    cid:6   exp  gJ  t=0   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 147  Group Field Theory  147         cid:15  cid:7 Π cid:11   arcsin  I = iκ  †  dg 4 ˆϕ   π[gJ ]  ∂ ∂πI i  †  dg 4  cid:2 π[gI ] ˆϕ  and volumes are extracted, and the ‘average holonomy’ ˆΠ[gI]av. =  cid:8  ˆΠ[gI ] cid:9   cid:8  ˆN cid:9 ,   cid:2  which contains extrinsic curvature information, computed from the extensive ‘total holonomy’ ˆΠ[gI ] =  gJ   ˆϕ gJ  , for a choice of coordinates on the 1 −  cid:2 π[g]2 1 − i cid:2 σ ·  cid:2 π[g], and the number operator ˆN . If these are the group g =  expectation values of the  operators coming directly from the full theory, one sees immediately that the theory incorporates crucial quantum corrections to the usual classical variables. In fact, the total ﬂux is, like its microscopic counterpart, non- commutative, while the standard cosmological variables correspond to its commu- tative limit ˆf i ˆϕ π[gJ ] . Likewise, from the average holon- omy one can deﬁne a macroscopic connection variable:  cid:2 ω := − cid:15 N cid:11 1 3 cid:15  cid:7 Π cid:11   cid:15  cid:7 Π cid:11   cid:15 N cid:11  . This second fact is important in several ways. To start with, one sees that the con- nection enters the eﬀective cosmological dynamics necessarily with quantum holon- omy corrections encoded in the sine function, as in loop quantum cosmology. Next, and most important, the eﬀective holonomy carries a dependence on the number of fundamental cells forming the universe. Again, this is like the lattice-reﬁnement scheme in loop quantum cosmology, but here not only the dependence on N is de- rived and not assumed, but this N is a new second quantized quantum observable of the theory, which enters necessarily both the kinematics and the eﬀective cosmolog- ical dynamics [72]. Finally, the same eﬀective dynamics will relate the expectation value of N and that of a, the scale factor, in such a way that cosmological holonomies end up depending on the scale factor as well, like in the so-called ¯μ-scheme of LQC. For more details, we refer to the literature [63, 65, 71, 72].a It is clear, however, that one has now many promising paths to explore, concerning, for example: the detailed analysis of eﬀective cosmology coming out of various fundamental GFT models  e.g. EPRL or BO , the study of improved ansatz for condensate states  with a more detailed encoding of topology, involving better correlations between GFT quanta, etc ; most important, a new way to study cosmological perturbations, understood as ﬂuctuations above the GFT condensate, for which the derivation of an eﬀective ﬁeld theory picture is the most pressing issue. Beside the many intrigu- ing conceptual aspects of this new picture of cosmology emerging from the full QG theory, this seems also a promising avenue towards extracting testable predictions directly from the fundamental theory, putting it in contact with observations.  We close by mentioning other results aiming at the extraction of eﬀective con- tinuum physics from GFTs, and working also in the spirit of mean ﬁeld theory, all obtained for GFT perturbations around  approximate  solutions of the classical GFT equations. They range from the derivation of an eﬀective non-graph chang- ing Hamiltonian constraint for spin networks starting from a GFT of topological type [73], to the extraction of classical equations for geometric phase space variables from the same GFT equations, using LQG coherent states as ansatz for the approx-  aThere have been further signiﬁcant advances in this area since this article was completed.

This last work is very close to the extraction of cosmology from GFT condensates discussed above. Also, focusing on the eﬀective dynamics of perturbations around classical GFT solutions, one could recast it in the form of non-commutative scalar ﬁeld theories on a non-commutative ﬂat space [75], at least for speciﬁc models and speciﬁc choices of perturbations. This is an intriguing result, which should now be reanalyzed in the context of GFT condensate cosmology.  6. Conclusions  We have provided a quick survey of the GFT formulation of quantum geometry and of its dynamics, and of some of the results in this area. We have tried to clarify the links  and diﬀerences  with loop quantum gravity and spin foam models, em- phasizing that GFTs oﬀer a new elegant description of a quantum gravity theory based on spin networks, and at the same time a completion of the spin foam dy- namics. This QFT framework, in particular, oﬀers new tools that may prove crucial for addressing the issue of the continuum approximation and for the extraction of eﬀective continuum dynamics from the full theory. In the long run, the goals of this approach are clear. We aim for:  1  a reliable  class of  model s  for 4d Lorentzian quantum gravity with matter, with a nice and well-understood encoding of quantum geometry at the microscopic scales;  2  a proof that the same  class of  model s  is perturbative renormalizable and possibly constructively well-deﬁned;  3  a de- tailed map of the continuum phase structure of the same model s ;  4  a detailed understanding of the eﬀective cosmological equations for the very early Universe emerging from the fundamental quantum gravity dynamics, and a quantum gravity solution to cosmological puzzles  ﬂatness and horizon problems, the cosmological constant, the cosmological singularity  within the full theory, including a theory of cosmological perturbations from ﬁrst  quantum gravity  principles, to be tested against observations. This is an ambitious program, as any quantum gravity pro- gram has to be. The main asset of the GFT formalism, we believe, is the novel outlook it provides on canonical LQG as well as on spin foams, and the new tools we mentioned, with the simultaneous possibility to incorporate and take advantage of all the results obtained in such contexts, alongside those obtained in related for- malisms like tensor models. It is this fruitful blend of solid, established results and techniques coming from diﬀerent corners with a novel, promising new perspective that we hope will guarantee many more results and scientiﬁc surprises in the future, and a decisive progress for the whole ﬁeld of quantum gravity.

Solving the Dynamics of Loop Quantum Gravity  As explained in Chapter 1, loop quantum gravity has provided a rigorous non- perturbative framework, in which to formulate the dynamics of quantum gravity. It allowed fascinating insights into quantum geometry and a possible structure of quantum space time. As discussed in Chapter 2, in order to specify the complete dynamics of the theory, one has to construct the so-called physical Hilbert space of wave functions satisfying the quantum constraints. In this process, we need to introduce the continuum limit  see Chapter 4 . In the framework presented here, physical states — i.e., solutions of the quantum constraints, which give the equations of motions of the theory — are constructed by taking the reﬁnement limit via a coarse graining procedure.  The conceptual underpinnings of this framework rely on the inductive limit Hilbert space construction used in loop quantum gravity to deﬁne the continuum Hilbert space [1], so far in the kinematical setting. We point out that this con- struction becomes more powerful if one allows for a generalization of the reﬁnement maps that deﬁne the inductive limit Hilbert spaces. It leads to a framework in which physical states are computed in a truncation scheme, where the type of truncation is determined by the dynamics itself. This procedure allows for an understanding of the dynamics of quantum gravity on all scales — where a notion of scale is given by the coarseness or ﬁneness of conﬁgurations. The diﬀerent scales of the theory are connected via the cylindrical consistency condition inherent in the inductive limit construction. This replaces the notion of renormalization ﬂow in theories with a background scale.  We start our considerations with a short explanation of the inductive limit con- struction in Section 2 and discuss the diﬀerence between kinematical and dynamical understanding of the continuum limit. In Section 3 we start with the task to con- struct the physical Hilbert space of the theory and explain that it necessitates the construction of the reﬁnement limit for the dynamics of the theory. This results in  153   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 154  154  B. Dittrich  an iterative coarse graining scheme, in which physical states — or amplitude maps — are constructed in a certain truncation, labelled by the coarseness or ﬁneness of the discrete structures involved. The relation of this scheme with a renormalization ﬂow is clariﬁed in Section 4. Concrete realizations of this scheme in the form of  decorated  tensor network methods are brieﬂy explained in Section 5. We then point out the powerful notion of diﬀeomorphism symmetry for discrete systems in Section 6. The realization of this diﬀeomorphism symmetry is necessary for the deﬁnition of physical states and also indicates that a continuum limit is reached. In this sense physical states can only be deﬁned in the continuum limit. We end with a discussion and outlook of future developments in Section 7.  2. Continuum Limit in Canonical Loop Quantum Gravity  Let us begin by clarifying the need for a continuum limit in canonical loop quantum gravity. To this end we will brieﬂy discuss how this continuum formulation is achieved  a complete discussion can be found in [2] . The key point is to use a inductive limit construction for the kinematical Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity. This construction needs the following ingredients  labels,   1  A directed partially ordered set of  in the case of the Ashtekar Lewandowski  AL  representation [1, 3] given by a suitable set of graphs α embedded into the spatial manifold M .

On a practical level they ensure that any calculation done on a given graph α  or any other discrete structure  gives the same result as on any reﬁned graph.  Thus the construction of the inductive limit enables one to test the theory ‘along’ discrete structures, such as the graphs α. It is however not the case that the states are unknown away from the discrete structure in question. In fact the embedding  cid:3  , starting from maps allow to reconstruct the states on an arbitrary reﬁned graph α  cid:3  states on a coarse graph α. That is all additional degrees of freedom, associable to α but not to α are being put into a speciﬁc state encoded in the embedding maps. It is natural to interpret this speciﬁc state as vacuum, in fact in the AL representation [3] discussed in Chapter 1, this state is given by the Ashtekar Lewandowski vacuum. It is given as  equivalence class represented by  the state associated to the empty graph α = ∅ which carries a one–dimensional Hilbert space H∅ = C. The equivalence class of this vacuum state is characterized by the chosen embeddings — turning this around, the nature of the vacuum state characterizes the embeddings.  As explained in Chapter 1, the basic ﬁeld variables of loop quantum gravity are given by the Ashtekar–Barbero connection Ai [4, 5]. The connection is integrated and exponentiated to holonomies, along the edges given by the graph α the triads give rise to ﬂux operators. The Ashtekar–Lewandowski vacuum is a totally squeezed state that gives maximal uncertainty to the connection and is maximally peaked at vanishing triad variables, that is formally ψvac A  ≡ 1. Thus the states in any Hα are highly distributional —  spatial  geometry encoded in  a and the triad densities Ea i  the triads is only excited along the graph α. Away from this graph, all expectation values and ﬂuctuations of the  smeared  triads are vanishing.  2.1. Kinematical Understanding of the Continuum Limit  We can now discuss the continuum limit in canonical loop quantum gravity at the kinematical level: construction of states in the AL representation, or even alterna- tive representations, that can be interpreted as describing continuum geometries. In the AL representation, the construction of coherent states has been explored [6] and coarse graining in the kinematical Hilbert space has also been considered [7]. However, here one works with a ﬁxed graph and therefore keeps the distributional nature of the states with respect to the excitations of spatial geometry — that is, the states again describe a spatial metric that is almost everywhere totally degenerate. It is also possible to construct alternative representations of the observable  holonomy–ﬂux  algebra of loop quantum gravity. The ﬁrst such alternative repre- sentation [8] changes the vacuum from being peaked on a totally degenerate spatial geometry to one that is peaked on a non-degenerate  background  geometry. In this Koslowski-Sahlmann representation, vacuum ﬂuctuations of the triad are still van- ishing. Note that the embedding maps for this representation are diﬀerent from the one for the AL representations. In particular the Koslowski–Sahlmann vacuum is   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 156  156  B. Dittrich  not invariant under  spatial  diﬀeomorphisms in contrast to the AL representation. Another alternative representation, that is based on a  space-time  diﬀeomor- phism invariant vacuum has been recently proposed [9] and can be understood as a dual of the AL representation. The vacuum is now again a totally squeezed state but is peaked on ﬂat connections, and maximally uncertain in the triad variables. This vacuum is actually a physical state for BF theory, whose equation of motion demand vanishing curvature. We will therefore label this representation as the BF. This construction is based, as the AL representation, on an inductive limit. However the label set is not given anymore by graphs but by triangulations. The vertices  in  2 + 1  dimensions  or edges  in  3 + 1  dimensions  of this triangulation can support curvature excitations. Thus the states can be interpreted as piecewise ﬂat geometries.  Note that in  3 + 1  dimensions this ﬂatness is with respect to the AL representation, whereas in the  2 + 1  dimensionsa the ﬂatness is with respect to the 3D spin connection.  In this sense this BF representation avoids a key problem of the AL representation, which is that AL states describe geometries which are almost everywhere totally degenerate.  Thus, whereas the AL embeddings impose the vanishing of  ‘ﬁner’  triad opera- tors, the BF embedding maps impose the vanishing of  ‘ﬁner’  curvature operators  built from holonomies . These embedding maps coincide with ‘naive time evo- lution maps’ that arise in BF theory. In  2 + 1  dimensions BF theory describes the dynamics of general relativity, and therefore the BF vacuum deﬁnes a physical state, giving rise to a physical Hilbert space. This illustrates an important point — namely, that eventually the embedding maps should be chosen by the dynamics of the system.  The BF representation has been also generalized — via a quantum group defor- mation of the underlying gauge group — to a vacuum peaked on a homogeneously curved geometry [10]. In  2 + 1  dimension the vacuum represents a physical state of general relativity with a cosmological constant, and is closely connected to the Turaev-Viro state sum model. These diﬀerent examples open up the questions of how many diﬀerent quantum geometry realizations one is able to construct [22].  A very diﬀerent approach, which avoids the selection of a vacuum state, is being developed in [11]. This framework replaces the inductive limit construction with a  dual  projective limit for the density functionals. But it is not clear yet, what kind of ‘typical states’ result from this framework.  3. Continuum Limit for the Dynamics of the Theory  We will now discuss a second — dynamical — understanding of the continuum limit. This would be the construction of the continuum physical Hilbert space of states satisfying the Hamiltonian and diﬀeomorphism,b constraints. Such physical  aRemarks about  2 + 1  dimensions refer to the Riemannian signature because the gauge group in the Lorentzian signature is non-compact. bEven if these constraints can be deﬁned only a posteriori as discussed in Section 6.

In fact we have now at our disposal several kinematical Hilbert spaces, all based on an inductive limit, but with diﬀerent embedding maps.  We expect that also the physical Hilbert space can be organized in the form of an inductive limit Hilbert space. In this case the embedding maps ια,α cid:2  will again diﬀer from the embedding maps for the kinematical Hilbert space. We will outline here a construction of such a physical Hilbert space, which would then represent the continuum physical Hilbert space.  quantization,  A strategy [2, 12] to construct physical states, known as reﬁned algebraic is by ‘projecting’ kinematical states via a so-called rigging map phys.c For totally constrained systems, where time evolution is a gauge transformation, one can formally write a ‘projector’ onto the space of solu- tions to quantum constraints as  η : Dkin → D∗  cid:4   cid:3  cid:17    cid:3    cid:4    cid:5  DN I exp  DXini  i  cid:2   N I ˆCI  ψ Xf in   DX exp  Xini,Xf in ﬁxed   cid:3   i  cid:2    cid:4   S X   ψini Xini  .  4   δ  ˆCI   ψ   Xf in  =  I   cid:5   cid:5   =  In the second line we wrote the path integral over some set of conﬁguration variables X with the corresponding action S X  for general relativity. Equation  4  states that this path integral serves as a  formal  projector onto states satisfying the Hamiltonian and diﬀeomorphism constraints [13].  The path integral is however only a formal object — so far, the only way to make it well deﬁned is to turn to a discretization. This is one route to spin foam models [14] for which, as discussed in Chapter 3, the  boundary  variables X can be made to match those of loop quantum gravity.d However, a discretization comes with several drawbacks:   a  A discretization typically breaks diﬀeomorphism symmetry for 4D gravity the- ories [16]. This prevents the discrete path integral to be a projector onto con- straints, these are rather weakened to pseudo constraints [16–18].   b  Related to the loss of diﬀeomorphism symmetry the path integral will in general depend on the choice of discrete structure, i.e. choice of  bulk  triangulation. This gives the triangulation an unwanted physical signiﬁcance.   c  There are many classical and quantum ambiguities in constructing the discrete  amplitudes.   d  The discrete path integral  4  can be deﬁned on the Hilbert spaces Hα associated to a given discretization α. However as an operator on the family of Hilbert spaces Hα the path integral will in general not be cylindrically consistent and thus not be well deﬁned on the continuum Hilbert space H [19–21].  cHere Dkin is a dense subspace of the kinematical Hilbert space, Dkin ⊂ H, whereas D∗ phys is given by the algebraic dual of a dense subspace Dphys in Hphys. The Rigging map is called the ‘group averaging map’ in Chapter 2. dMore precisely the boundary Hilbert spaces match [15], at least on the discrete level.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 158  158  B. Dittrich   e  Finally a discrete path integral requires also an organization of the target  phys- ical Hilbert  space as an inductive limit. The path integral as an operator should then also be cylindrically consistent with respect to dynamical embed- ding maps [20, 22] describing the physical Hilbert space.  We will argue that all these issues can be addressed by coarse graining the initial discrete path integral. As we will see this can also be interpreted as reﬁning and amounts to the construction of the continuum limit for the discretized path integral. To achieve the continuum limit for the dynamics of quantum gravity means in particular to turn the path integral into a cylindrical consistent operator, that is solve issues  d  and  e . We will describe here an iterative coarse graining process that aims at the construction of such a cylindrical consistent path integral.  This iterative process produces a coarse graining ﬂow. Fixed points of such coarse graining ﬂows often enjoy an enhanced symmetry. Several examples [23, 24] and arguments show that the diﬀeomorphism symmetry, in particular, is likely to be restored  see Section 6 , which addresses problem  a . The same examples and the realization of diﬀeomorphism symmetry in the discrete — so called vertex dis- placements — show that diﬀeomorphism symmetry is equivalent with triangulation independence [23, 25], which resolves problem  b . Finally the coarse graining ﬂow is considered on a space of models. Such a ﬂow allows the characterization of rel- evant and irrelevant directions in this space of models, which addresses the issue  c . In particular, diﬀeomorphism invariance and triangulation independence are extremely strong requirements, thus one can hope that a discrete model satisfying these requirements  and leading to a suitable semi-classical limit  is, if it exists at all, unique.  We will furthermore argue that the issue  e  will lead to   f  a notion of physical vacuum for quantum gravity.  This physical vacuum will be encoded into amplitude maps Aα : Hα → C. These  maps deﬁne the amplitudes for the cylindrically consistent path integral and thus replace the ‘bare’ amplitudes of the initial discretization of the path integral. Here the label α stands for a discretization that can be obtained by reﬁnement from an ‘empty’ discretization ∅ with H∅ = C.  The amplitude map applied to a boundary wave functione ψα ∈ Hα gives the pairing of this wave function with the wave function K∅αψ∅, resulting from a reﬁning time evolution of the  kinematical no boundary  wave function ψ∅ to a wave function associated to the boundary α. This reﬁning time evolution is given by a path integral and can therefore be understood to implement a rigging map, see equation  4 . That  eThe framework [26] introduces a generalization of Cauchy boundaries to boundaries of arbitrary regions, which is useful in this context.

We have to regularize this path integral on a discretization that ﬁts in between the two boundaries ∅ and α. This discretization introduces of course the problems mentioned above, turning the expressions in the second line into not well deﬁned ones. We will discuss below an iterative procedure to take the reﬁnement limit of this discretization, that addresses these problems.  We pointed out in equation  4  that the time evolution operator in the form of the path integral should act as a projector onto physical states, which deﬁnes the rigging map η, here applied to the no-boundary  kinematical  wave function ψ∅. The last equation just displays the deﬁnition of a physical inner product in the reﬁned algebraic quantization procedure [12]   cid:8 ψα ψ  α cid:2  cid:9 phys := η ψα  · ψ  cid:3   cid:3  α cid:2    6    cid:3  between the projections of two kinematical states ψα and ψ α cid:2  .  It suﬃces to apply the rigging map once, as it is given by a time evolution which acts as an usually improper projector.   The amplitude maps encode the dynamics of the system [27] and will replace the ‘bare’ amplitudes of the initial discretized path integral. Note that such a discretized  path integral is often built by associating amplitudes AB to basic building blocks B. Indeed from the deﬁnition  5  the basic amplitudes AB give the amplitude map in the coarsest triangulation possible. To this end we assume that one can reﬁne the empty discretization ∅ to the one given by the boundary of B by gluing the building block B to ∅. proved amplitudes Aα by  i  reﬁning the bulk discretization and  ii  also allowing a  The iterative reﬁnement process will replace these basic amplitudes with im-  reﬁning of the boundary discretization, that is, generalize from the boundary of B to ﬁner boundary discretizations α. This generalization of the basic building blocks, that allows the incorporation of more boundary data, is important to convert non- local couplings, that inadvertently are produced by coarse graining to local  nearest neighbor  couplings of the improved amplitudes.  The end point of the construction should lead to a cylindrically consistent am-  plitude map satisfying cylindrical consistency  Aα cid:2   ιαα cid:2  ψα   = Aα ψα    7   fWe denoted the complex conjugated path integral amplitudes exp − i S X, Xα   to indicate that the complex conjugation of the wave function evolved from ψ∅. In spin foams  and in other approaches which incorporate in  4  an integration over positive and negative lapse  the sum over the basic variables includes a sum over orientations of space time. This leads to real amplitudes. This feature is important to obtain the projector property of the path integral.   cid:2    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 160  160  B. Dittrich  with respect to certain embedding maps ιαα cid:2  . As we will argue below, it might be much easier to construct such cylindrical consistent amplitudes if we replace the kinematical embedding maps with dynamical ones. Such cylindrical consistent  amplitude maps are then deﬁned on a continuum Hilbert space H[∅] associated to the equivalence class of discretizations, that can be obtained by applying reﬁnement operations to the empty discretization ∅.  This brings us to the second interpretation of the amplitude maps as representing  the  dualized  physical vacuum. This interpretation is due to two points: Firstly we deﬁned the amplitude map via a reﬁning time evolution starting from a ‘no-boundary’ discretization ∅. The resulting wave function can be seen as a Hartle Hawking no-boundary wave function [28].g This point is also strengthened as the amplitude map Aα ·  = η ψ∅ · results from applying the rigging map, to the kinematical vacuum ψ∅ ∈ C, which one would expect to carry the notion of having no excitations and leading to a homogeneous state, see also [29]. This concept of generating a vacuum state by reﬁning time evolution comes also up in formulations incorporating evolving phase spaces [30] or Hilbert spaces [31], classical and quantum examples that support this interpretation can be found in [22]. In the formulation employed here, evolving Hilbert spaces are taken into account via the concept of inductive limit Hilbert spaces.   cid:3   Secondly, we will use the amplitude maps to deﬁne dynamical embedding maps. That is the amplitude maps lead to an improved, and in the reﬁnement limit, perfect discretization of the path integral. This path integral can be used to deﬁne a reﬁning time evolution, interpolating between a boundary α and a reﬁned boundary α . However, as we discussed, there is no proper time evolution in diﬀeomorphism invariant systems, it rather acts as a projector onto physical states. In case the initial state ψα is physical, the resulting state ψα cid:2  should therefore be equivalent to ψα. This is realized if we assume an inductive limit structure for the physical Hilbert space and use the reﬁning time evolution as  dynamical  embedding maps ιαα cid:2  = Kαα cid:2  , as proposed in [22]. ια cid:2 α cid:2  cid:2  ◦ ιαα cid:2  = ιαα cid:2  cid:2  for any triple α ≺ α  Note that such embedding maps have to satisfy the consistency conditions , as discussed in Section 2. For a  reﬁning  time evolution these conditions follow from Kuchar’s requirement of a path independence of evolution [32], which is equivalent to the constraint algebra being consistent, that is ﬁrst class, which itself signiﬁes that diﬀeomorphism symme- try is correctly implemented. We can therefore expect this consistency condition to hold in the reﬁnement limit, in which we hope to restore diﬀeomorphism symmetry. Another aspect of path independence of evolution is a condition involving as an   cid:3  ≺ α   cid:3  cid:3   in-between state one that is ﬁner than the ﬁnal state:  Kα cid:2  cid:2 α cid:2  ◦ Kαα cid:2  cid:2  = Kαα cid:2    8   gIn the actual proposal [28] Wick rotates part of the time evolution. We do not assume such a Wick rotation here, which would indeed be hard to deﬁne in a completely background independent context.

To this end we understand the term on the RHS of the ﬁrst line in  9  as consisting of two steps. The ﬁrst is  a more reﬁned boundary α. One would build such an amplitude functional from  , that is basically the amplitude functional Aα cid:2  for  the computation of  cid:8 ψ∅ K∅α cid:2    gluing amplitudes Aα for less reﬁned boundaries α. As we want to deﬁne an iterative process that improves the amplitude maps Aα, we need to ﬁnd a way to ‘evolve back’ the amplitudes Aα cid:2  to the boundary Hilbert space Hα, which is done by using the dynamical embedding map ιαα cid:2  = Kαα cid:2  .

We will ex-  plain a tensor network algorithm in Section 5.  Once one has constructed amplitude maps that are cylindrically consistent  to a satisfying degree , one can use these amplitude maps to deﬁne an improved dis- cretization of the path integral  4  and with it the rigging map. This is using the interpretation of the amplitude maps as giving the amplitudes of building blocks, which can now carry more boundary data.  Let us examine the gluing properties of these improved building blocks, in partic- ular in which sense the amplitude for a given  ﬁner  boundary can be obtained from   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 162  162  B. Dittrich  gluing building blocks with coarser boundary. If this would be the case we would achieve independence from the chosen discretization, i.e. form the decomposition of a given region into building blocks. For this consider a simpliﬁed situation with two manifolds of topology Σ× [0, 1] glued along a common Σ hypersurface. The amplitude for the ﬁrst manifold with is given by Kαα cid:2  , for the second manifold we have Kα cid:2 α cid:2  cid:2  so that boundaries α, α the glued amplitude is   cid:3   Kα cid:2 α cid:2  cid:2  ◦ Kαα cid:2  ?= Kαα cid:2  cid:2  .   11   Thus discretization independence  here invariance under subdivision  would be real- ized if the equality in  11  holds. This equation can however not be true for arbitrary would restrict the amount of infor- coarse in-between boundary α should in general be ﬁner than mation that can propagate from α to α both α and α .

However, as this is also used in the coarse graining procedure which builds such cylindrical consistent amplitudes one would expect that — depending on the coarseness of the outer boundaries not glued over — the gluing property is satisﬁed to better and better degree for ﬁner and ﬁner boundaries and in particular satisﬁed exactly if one takes for the boundary glued over the reﬁnement limit. For subtleties that come up even in the continuum, see [26].  4. Renormalization Flow and Scale in Background Independent  Theories   cid:2    cid:3   Here we want to discuss the relations and diﬀerences of the framework developed in Section 3, where the construction of cylindrical consistent amplitudes is central, to the understanding of renormalization ﬂow in systems with a notion of background  scale  [21, 34, 35].

Instead there are two entities, which replace the background scale: one is the discretization labels α characterizing the coarseness or ﬁneness of a given bound- ary. The other is the geometry, which is part of the dynamical variables and thus determined by the boundary data or wave function. The renormalization trajectory Aa, parametrized by the scale a is replaced in background independent systems by the cylindrically consistent family of ampli- tude maps. Thus a cylindrically consistent family of amplitude maps deﬁnes a renormalization ﬂow.  To see this consider the path integral over a certain region built from building blocks B or regions with a certain homogeneous boundary ﬁneness α. Subdivide  cid:3 }. We then want to each of these building blocks into further building blocks {B compare the path integral based on amplitude maps for building blocks B with the  cid:3  .

This last point is the starting point of [19, 21] for conﬁguration spaces of connections and with the AL embedding maps. See also the discussion in [21] for a derivation of boundary cylindrical consistency [20] from bulk cylindrical consistency.  Thus we see that indeed the renormalization trajectory Aa is replaced by the cylindrical consistent set of amplitude maps Aα. Still one should avoid to equate  the scale a with the boundary coarseness α. To consider amplitudes at a certain scale one would have to ﬁx properties of the boundary wave function ψα or alterna- tively for the amplitude kernels AB X  consider variables X restricted to describe  a certain scale.  The question whether a continuum  or reﬁnement  limit of a quantum grav- ity model exist can be now reformulated as follows: Does there exist a family of cylindrical consistent amplitude maps that would display the correct semi-classical limit, at least for boundary ﬁelds describing a slowly varying geometry or alterna- tively small curvature? Assuming that slowly varying geometry can be described on a coarse boundary one would need in particular to check the semi-classical limit  for simple building blocks AB with a coarse boundary α. The semi-classical limit  involves to consider a scaling of geometric variables so that these describe lengths much larger than Planck length lB Xα B   >> lP lanck.  Here lB can be understood as the scale on which the boundary geometry described by Xα B  can vary.  In this limit we expect  AB Xα B   ∼ cos SH Xα B      17   where SH is Hamilton’s principal function, i.e. the action evaluated on the solution determined by the boundary values Xα B  . Here we assumed that building blocks   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 165  The Continuum Limit: A Framework for Solving the Theory  165  will contribute with both possible orientations, as is the case in spin foams. As we saw in Chapter 3, Condition  5  is indeed satisﬁed for spin foams [36], at least for the simplest building blocks, that is simplexes.  Thus the semi-classicality requirement for the amplitudes is at ‘mesoscopic’ scales lB >> lP lanck. Indeed we need to regularize the path integral via a discretiza- tion. Even classically  non-perfect  discretization are only reliable reproducing ob- servables which are  much  coarser than the  coarseness  scale of the discretization. If we consider a ﬁxed boundary geometry we can translate this statement into the discretization reproducing observables on scales  much  larger than the discretiza- tion scale.  As the cylindrical consistency conditions are very restricting, we can hope that the condition of cylindrical consistency leads to a unique family of amplitudes, that then deﬁne the theory at all scales  i.e. for all boundary wave functions . This philosophy is similar to the asymptotic safety scenario [37] where one hopes to extrapolate to the UV starting from the IR dynamics of a given theory. Thus the question whether a reﬁnement limit exist is similar to the asymptotic safety conjecture, namely the existence of an interacting UV ﬁxed point. The question whether we ﬁnd a unique family of cylindrically consistent amplitudes is connected to the number of relevant couplings at this ﬁxed point, which the asymptotic safety scenario conjectures to be ﬁnite.  This question — whether a family of cylindrically consistent amplitudes exist or not — will also determine the allowed matter couplings. The reconstruction of the renormalization ﬂow in terms of the usual notion of scale, as discussed further below, should also reproduce the ﬂow of the standard model matter couplings — as far as known. Thus including matter couplings would also mean to construct an UV completion of the corresponding quantum ﬁeld theories — if such UV completions exist. One expects restrictions on the allowed matter content — as has been already shown in the asymptotic safety scenario to arise [38].  As laid out in the previous section, the cylindrical consistent family of am- plitudes, that is the renormalization trajectory, can be constructed via an iter- ative coarse graining procedure. The initial amplitudes for this procedure, can be constructed by using a discretization — as is done in the spin foam approach described in Chapter 3. The iterative coarse graining procedure reconstructs the renormalization ﬂow in a larger and larger space of ‘couplings’, that also include the parametrization of discretization ambiguities. With respect to the auxiliary coarse graining ﬂow, that is used to construct the family of cylindrically consistent amplitudes, one can apply the usual notions of relevant irrelevant couplings and universality. Thus discretization ambiguities  irrelevant couplings with respect to this ﬂow  are taken care of, see [23] for an explicit example. This addresses the issue  c  in Section 3. Of course one would hope that the ﬂow does not change the semi-classical property  5  of the initial amplitudes, i.e. that the integrated out quantum eﬀects do not change the amplitudes at mesoscopic scales in the sense described above.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 166  166  B. Dittrich  A notion of ﬂow, nearer to the Wilsonian one based on scale, would require a reconstruction of this scale from the geometric boundary data. For this one needs to ﬁnd a way to decompose the geometric variables into small and large scale ones and to correspondingly organize the amplitudes into families of eﬀective ones by integrating out small scale degrees of freedom. This procedure would basically involve the continuum amplitudes encoded in the cylindrical consistent family. A problem is then to ﬁnd a  preferably non-perturbative  notion of geometric scale. Of course also with respect to this ﬂow one can classify relevant irrelevant couplings, which are now nearer to the standard notion.  5.  Decorated  Tensor Network Renormalization for Spin Nets and  Spin Foams  The construction of cylindrical consistent amplitude-maps is a highly demanding task — it basically requires to solve the theory for arbitrary complicated boundary data. One therefore hopes for an eﬃcient approximation scheme. The parameter describing the approximations is naturally given by the coarseness α. We can think of this parameter as determining the complexity of boundary data. This approxi- mation scheme is similar to the calculation of scattering amplitudes for more and more particles  at inﬁnity . Similar to the expectation that for a scattering ampli- tude involving few particles at inﬁnity in-between states with many particles are less relevant, one can hope that the coarser the boundary data the less relevant become in-between states involving very ﬁne α. For this to hold true it is essential that the embedding maps — that determine the properties of excitations supported by the discrete structure α — are derived from the dynamics of the system.  Tensor network coarse graining schemes [39] implement a recursive improvement of the amplitudes as in  10  and  16 . The name ‘tensor network’ indicates that the amplitudes are encoded in tensors associated to vertices  and dual to space time regions . The indices of a tensor at a vertex v are associated to edges attached to the vertex v. These edges are also dual to the boundary of the space time region  i.e. the edges cross the boundary . Gluing two space time regions is then equivalent to contracting two indices of two neighboring tensors.  The complexity of the boundary data, that is the coarseness parameter α trans- lates here into the rank of the tensor and the index range, the so-called bond dimension χ  assuming ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces, which are associated to the edges . Note that several edges  indices  of a tensor can be encoded into one edge  index  — thus the bond dimension might increase during the algorithm.  Let us explain an algorithm for a 2D model, in which the amplitudes are encoded into rank four tensors with bond dimension χ. Thus we discretize the partition function  or path integral  with a regular square lattice, where the squares are dual to the four-valent vertices.  One now glues four of such squares to a new square. This however also increases the number of edges, i.e. the amount of boundary data — the bond dimension is   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 167  The Continuum Limit: A Framework for Solving the Theory  167  now χ2. One needs to reduce these back to the original size χ  which can be chosen to be much larger than the index range of the original tensors .  ...A  M M  ... B  α β  ...A  M  α  β  i    V  Fig. 1. Left: Two vertices in a tensor network, encoded in the matrices M , are sharing two edges with labels {α, β}, which have a total range of χ2. Right: From the singular value decomposition we can deﬁne the map V depicted as a three-valent vertex, where we restrict the label i of the singular values to be ≤ χ.  χ2 cid:8   i=1  In the case of tensor network methods one chooses a truncation — via an em- bedding map as in  16  — that is chosen from the dynamics of the system. The idea is to approximate as well as possible the summation between two tensors. The situation is depicted in Figure 1. One organizes the indices of the tensors such that we can rewrite them into matrices M . We would like to replace the edges carrying an index pair {α, β} of size χ2 with an eﬀective edge carrying only a number χ of indices. An optimal truncation for the summation over the index pair {α, β}, is given by the singular value decomposition of MAαβ:  MAαβ =  UAiλiVi αβ   18   where λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . . ≥ λχ2 ≥ 0 are positive, and U, V are unitary matrices. The truncation drops the smaller set of singular values λi with i > χ. Pictorially Viαβ restricted to i ≤ χ deﬁnes a three-valent vertex and we can use these three-valent vertices as in Figure 1 to arrive at a coarse grained region with less boundary data. Applying the three-valent tensors to the square just glued, we obtain a new ef- fective tensor, with the same bond dimension as before. This algorithm is applicable to systems with and without a background scale. For both cases one hopes that the truncation picks indeed the coarse  homogeneous  data.  This is supported by several examples; see the discussion in Ref. [22]. A better truncation could be reached by choosing the embedding maps to be more non-local  i.e. involving all boundary data and not only those associated to a pair of edges . Indeed in this case the truncation can be even made exact [22]. To see this consider a ‘radial’ evolution from a coarser to a ﬁner boundary. The evolution operator only maps to a subspace of the target Hilbert space with dimension equal or smaller than the initial Hilbert space. Thus a singular value decomposition would turn out to have only as many non-vanishing singular values as we would take into account in the truncation. A certain notion of locality is however needed to be able to glue the new squares to each other. For a more non-local truncation scheme than the one described here see [40].   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 168  168  B. Dittrich  Such 2D algorithms have been successfully applied to spin net models [41], which are analogue models to spin foams, that can be also deﬁned in 2D [42, 43]. The spin nets can also be interpreted as speciﬁc  ‘melonic’  spin foams, see [43] and are conjectured to have similar statistical properties to spin foams. To be able to do numerical simulations the models considered so far are based on either ﬁnite groups or quantum groups SU  2 k. The latter are conjectured to describe quantum gravity with a cosmological constant [44].  The group symmetry protecting variant of the algorithm developed in [42, 43] allows to keep track of the behavior of intertwiner degrees of freedom, which signify the status of the simplicity constraints — the ingredient of spin foams that distin- guishes them from standard lattice gauge theories. The initial model diﬀer in the choice of these simplicity constraints. This allows to scan an entire set of models for a reasonable continuum limit. To this end one needs to ﬁnd a good parametrization of the initial phase space [43, 45, 46].  In fact the simplicity constraints lead to a large extension of the phase space of the latter. A very rich structure of topological ﬁxed points  corresponding to phases in statistical model language  and phase transitions  candidates for inter- acting theories  has been found in [43], based on a parametrization of intertwiners developed in [46]. The 2D models also allow to study the concepts discussed in Section 3. In particular the notion of dynamical embedding maps and related vacua states describe condensation phenomena — in the 2D intertwiner models of anyons described by SU  2 k fusion modules [46, 47].  Recently, SU  2 k × SU  2 k spin net models which impose Barrett–Crane  [48] simplicity constraints have been tested [49] and show also an interesting phase structure, which arises by only varying the so-called face weights of the model.  The richness of the phase structure found so far reinforces the hope that spin foams lead to a reasonable continuum limit. Of course one needs to conﬁrm this hope by coarse graining actual spin foam models. These models are more general in their structure than tensor models, which are basically vertex models, with variables on edges and weight on vertices. In spin foam models variables do also appear on two-dimensional objects, i.e. plaquettes.  Decorated tensor networks [50] can deal with this issue in an eﬀective way. Here one returns to representing the partition function as a gluing of building blocks. These building blocks carry boundary variables as prescribed by the initial model in question. A interesting feature of the procedure is that the type of these initial boundary variables is not changed. This allows a much more straightforward in- terpretation of the coarse graining ﬂow by keeping track of the behavior of these variables. For spin foams these variables coincide with the intertwiner degrees of freedom so important for spin nets — which is one reason to expect similar behav- ior under coarse graining. The geometric interpretation of the  spin  variables in spin foams allows to access whether the coarse graining leads in fact to a geometric   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 169  The Continuum Limit: A Framework for Solving the Theory  169  coarse graining of the system. This feature will in particular be encoded in the embedding maps.  In lowest order approximation the building blocks will carry  almost  the same amount of boundary data, as the initial model. As mentioned this allows for a straightforward interpretation of the coarse graining ﬂow of these systems. Going to higher order truncations one incorporates more boundary data by associating a tensor to the building blocks which now introduces ‘higher order’ variables. The entire coarse graining procedure is similar to tensor network algorithms  i.e. also based on singular value decompositions , but ‘decorated’ by the original variables of the model.  Another feature of decorated tensor networks is that they may allow for  semi–  analytical calculations, see also [51]. This is important to be able to treat spin foam models based on Lie groups, where the issue of divergences arise [53, 54], see also the discussion in Section 6.  In tensor network algorithms the truncation is determined by the dynamics. This is so far the only way to ﬁnd a reliable truncation, but makes the algorithms computationally very demanding. An alternative might be to use truncations, in- formed by some geometric intuition. E.g. [52] imposes a restriction to discretizations built out of cuboids, that describe geometries without curvature but with torsions. The truncations can be again imposed by an embedding map, that this time is how- ever chosen by hand. The ﬂatness makes the action contribution to the amplitudes vanish, thus the coarse graining ﬂow tests only the measure terms. This ﬂow does however indicate a restoration of  a remnant of  diﬀeomorphism symmetry, as we will explain in the next section.  6. Diﬀeomorphism Symmetry in the Discrete, Constraints and  Divergences  In this section we will elaborate more on a notion of diﬀeomorphism symmetry in the discrete. This symmetry is very powerful [55, 56]. In fact its realization signiﬁes that the continuum limit has been reached in the following way: although the physics is expressed on a discrete structure, the predictions for observables, which can be supported by this discrete structure coincide with those of the continuum model. Such a discretization is called perfect [24, 57] — it exactly mirrors continuum physics. Thus the reﬁnement limit is necessary to reach diﬀeomorphism symmetry and thus a notion of physical states.  The notion of diﬀeomorphism symmetry under discussion also arises for dis- cretizations which do not explicitly involve coordinates. For instance in Regge calculus [58] the variables are given by the lengths of the edges in a triangulation.i These geometric data of the discrete elements allow one to determine the relative position of the vertices with respect to each other. In fact if there is a symmetry of  iAlternatively one can use areas and angles [59], which is nearer to the variables used in spin foams.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 170  170  B. Dittrich  the actionj allowing for these relative vertex positions — expressed in the geometric data of the discretization — to change, we speak of a realization of diﬀeomorphism symmetry in the discrete. This symmetry is also referred to as vertex translations, as it coincides in the 3D BF formulation of gravity with the shift or translation symmetry of the triad ﬁelds [60].  Such a symmetry has been indeed identiﬁed for linearized Regge calculus [61] and a number of examples [23, 24, 56]. It is however broken if one considers a  Regge  solution of 4D gravity with curvature [16] or perturbative Regge gravity beyond linear order [18]. Here ‘broken symmetry’ means that the Hessian will display modes with very small eigenvalues  compared to the other eigenvalues , instead of null modes. This breaking has severe repercussions. It prevents the path integral — for the regularization of which we need to introduce the discretization — from acting as a projector onto physical states.  One can deﬁne a canonical discrete time formulation that is consistent with the covariant one, i.e., that reproduces the equations of the covariant framework [17, 18]. This formalism also consistently transfers the  broken  symmetries into  pseudo  constraints. Whereas constraints are given as equations of motions that only involve the canonical data of one time step, pseudo constraints will also involve, with a weak dependence, the data of a neighboring time step.  Thus, one reason to take the reﬁnement limit is actually to restore the diﬀeo- morphism symmetry [24, 62], as is also used in the perfect action program [57] for lattice QCD with regard to Lorentz symmetry. There are a number of arguments for such a restoration: one is that the pseudo gauge modes should have a small lattice correlation length and decouple in the continuum limit [62]. Another is that for Regge calculus with ﬂat building blocks, for instance, the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the action associated to the pseudo gauge modes scale with the curvature per building block of the solution [16]. In the reﬁnement limit this curvature goes to zero, thus leading to a restoration of the symmetries.  We described the symmetry as allowing displacements of vertices. This is ba- sically the reason why this symmetry is so powerful and requires the continuum limit: For a system with such a symmetry it means that, given a solution, we can move the vertices around  i.e. change the associated geometric data  with- out changing the value of the action. Thus we can for instance move vertices on top of each other, reaching a coarser triangulation. This is basically the ar- gument that diﬀeomorphism symmetry implies triangulation independence [23]. One can furthermore move the vertices such that one region appears very ﬁnely grained and another very coarse grained.  Again this is with respect to a solution, which provides a scale . Thus our model has to display continuum physics reli- it has to be a perfect able on all scales and show no discretization artifacts, i.e.  jThat is, the Hessian of the action evaluated on a solution needs to have null modes making the solutions non-unique [16, 25]. The action itself  away from solutions  will allow a huge class of invariant deformations, most of these trivialize however if restricted to solutions.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 171  The Continuum Limit: A Framework for Solving the Theory  171  discretization. Such a perfect discretization avoids all problems  ambiguities, break- ing of symmetries, triangulation dependence  of a ‘typical’ discretization.  For interacting systems one can hope only for non-local actions or amplitudes to display such a powerful symmetry. This is shown explicitly, with the non-existence of a local path integral measure for linear Regge calculus [63]. Non-local amplitudes are very diﬃcult to deal with — in fact the framework described in Sections 3 and 5 avoids non-local couplings by introducing building blocks with more boundary data — since they are akin to introducing more ﬁelds in the continuum to absorb higher derivatives. Since diﬀeomorphism symmetry implies triangulation invariance we can also hope that coarse graining schemes on a regular lattice are suﬃcient to recover fully triangulation invariant models, which is indeed conﬁrmed so far for spin net models [42, 43, 46].  As noted above  ﬁrst class Hamiltonian and diﬀeomorphism  constraints can only appear if the discretization shows diﬀeomorphism symmetry and hence is per- fect. Thus for 4D gravity one has to expect non-local constraints. Again, the framework developed in Section 3 could be of help here, as it might be possible to  derive constraints on very coarse Hilbert spaces Hα ﬁrst and then going to ﬁner  and ﬁner ones. This does not exclude graph-changing Hamiltonians [64], although one would expect that an inductive Hilbert space, based on dynamical embedding maps, allows for graph-non-changing ones. In fact for the simplest triangulations, leading to only ﬂat bulk solutions, it is possible to ﬁnd ﬁrst class constraints [65]. Note that constraints which are derived from cylindrically consistent amplitudes, do also describe the ﬂow of  matter  coupling constants. This can for example ap- pear in the form of couplings, that depend on the geometric variables associated to building blocks. This information on the couplings of the running is dynamical information which, if the constraints are indeed derived from the consistent ampli- tudes, is obtained from the coarse graining process that led to these amplitudes. It seems impossible to construct consistent Hamiltonian constraints, without having such an explicit process that determines the running of the couplings.  One can also turn the argument around and say that if a reﬁnement limit does not lead to a restoration of the symmetries  or ﬁrst class property of the constraints , the system is inherently discrete [68]. The question of whether a reﬁnement limit ‘exist’ or not might however depend on many details of how the system is con- structed as well as how one attempts to constructk the continuum limit.  Let us also remark on the relation between divergences and diﬀeomorphism sym- metry. As the gauge orbits of this symmetry are non-compact  with the exception of Euclidean gravity with positive cosmological constant  one has to expect that the partition function diverges in the case the symmetries are realized.  Vertex trans- lations may also cross building blocks, reversing orientations of these [66], which  kReference [68] makes a choice of  local  constraints, turns these into a master constraint [17, 67] and tests this master constraint on a certain class of semi-classical states. Each step involves a number of ambiguities.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 172  172  B. Dittrich  allows for non-compact orbits.  Thus one would expect a divergence of ΛN D for D space time dimension and N triangulation vertices. This is indeed conﬁrmed for  topological  3D spin foams with the link to the diﬀeomorphism symmetry made explicit [60]. The divergence structure of the 4D models is less clear [53, 54], as it also depends on a choice of path integral measure in the form of so-called edge and face weights [54, 69]. A correct divergence structure in itself would of course not be suﬃcient for a model to display diﬀeomorphism symmetry, as this structure can be easily tuned by only changing face and edge weights [54], but leaving the  discretized  action unaﬀected. Additionally the existence of degenerate conﬁgura- tions, which may display enhanced symmetries [54] and divergences complicate the issue.  As symmetries are typically broken one would expect the initial model to be ﬁnite.  As noted in [54] special conﬁgurations might actually exist, which show enhanced symmetries and might lead to divergences.  However, with the restoration of symmetries under coarse graining, the path integral becomes however more and more divergent. One could expect a problem here, however one can indeed deal with this successfully even in a numerical approach [23]. In fact the coarse graining procedure involves a rescaling of the amplitudes in each step. One would then expect that the  candidate  divergences lead to an enhancement of the terms in the amplitude that do lead to diﬀeomorphism symmetry and a suppression of the other terms. Thus diﬀeomorphism symmetry might enhance its own restoration in the reﬁnement limit in this way.  7. Summary and Outlook  A reﬁnement limit is inescapable for the construction of the full theory of  loop  quantum gravity. Only in this limit can we expect the realization of diﬀeomorphism symmetry, thus a notion of Hamiltonian and diﬀeomorphism constraints and ﬁnally physical states. Indeed as we explained here constructing the reﬁnement limit means to construct physical states and a physical Hilbert space.  We presented a framework to formulate and construct the reﬁnement limit using the essential structure of inductive limit Hilbert spaces and the concept of cylin- drical consistent amplitudes, where the notion of cylindrical consistency is induced from the dynamics. The  tensor network  coarse graining procedures we discussed construct such amplitudes iteratively in a truncation scheme. The dynamics auto- matically determines this truncation, by introducing a notion of coarse states with few excitations and very ﬁne states with many excitations. The excitations are with respect to a vacuum state that is also determined from the dynamics.  Although the construction of the reﬁnement limit requires basically the solution of the model, it can be organized in a truncation scheme. The approximation im- proves with ﬁner and ﬁner discretizations that support more and more complicated boundary data. Some physical situations, such as cosmology, involve rather coarse   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 173  The Continuum Limit: A Framework for Solving the Theory  173  data. Therefore, one might hope that a derivation of cosmology can be obtained at a low truncation order [70]  but suﬃciently ﬁne to determine the dynamical embedding maps essential for the understanding of the truncation .  We laid out the relation of the reﬁnement scheme to renormalization involving a  background  scale. The scale is basically replaced by the coarseness of the dis- cretizations — although one should be careful in equating the two. The notion of a complete renormalization trajectory is replaced by the notion of cylindrically consistent amplitudes, showing the correct semi-classical limit behavior  i.e. for large geometries . The crucial question is whether such cylindrically consistent amplitudes exist.  Renormalization comes up also in group ﬁeld theories  GFT’s  discussed in Chapter 4, again in order to regulate divergences [71, 72]. In this case one sums over triangulations and hopes to achieve a continuum limit by choosing weights such that conﬁgurations with inﬁnitely many building blocks dominate [73]. The relation between renormalization in a GFT sense [74], which involves an explicit scale, and the coarse graining scheme presented here needs to be better understood, in particular since the divergences  may  correspond to gauge symmetries in the spin foam framework.  A GFT understanding of vertex translations leads to global symmetries [75].   One can argue that, due to the restoration of diﬀeomorphism symmetry in the form of vertex displacement invariance, a given suﬃciently ﬁne lattice may simulate many coarser lattices. A variant of this argument is used in [76], to show that reﬁne- ment and summing over triangulations should lead to the same result.l To inquire more about this relation, it is essential to clarify the relations between the Hilbert spaces involved, as the notion of cylindrical consistency is rather diﬀerent [78]. In- deed, whether one prefers reﬁning or summing over triangulations to obtain  bulk  triangulation independent amplitudes, in both cases we demand the amplitudes to be cylindrically consistent with respect to some choice of embedding maps. This latter notion speciﬁes the relation between diﬀerent boundary discretizations, and turns the amplitudes into well-deﬁned maps on the continuum Hilbert space.  We will conclude by commenting on some possible future developments. Coarse graining results from spin net models hint at a rich phase space structure for spin foams. With an explicit coarse graining scheme for spin foams at hand [50], we can soon expect results that will allow deep insights into the dynamical mechanisms of spin foams and thus, hopefully, the workings of quantum spacetime.  Even the identiﬁcation of topological ﬁeld theories in the phase diagram of spin foams can give rise to exciting developments. Such topological ﬁeld theories lead to cylindrical consistent embedding maps, thus to new inductive limit Hilbert spaces [9, 10, 22]. These can be used to construct further alternative vacua and representations for loop quantum gravity,m possibly with a notion of simplicity constraints and  lSee also [71, 77] for a related discussion of this issue, namely whether the sum over triangulations leads to the path integral as projector. mNote that the uniqueness results [79] pertaining to the AL representation do not apply in the more general situations in which the ﬂux operators exist only in an exponentiated form.

Diﬀerent vacua and representations allow to expand the theories around diﬀerent regimes and to thus organize the dynamics of the theory with respect to diﬀerent notions of excitations. This opens new perspectives for loop quantum gravity and can lead to a large extension of the framework.

Introduction  The goal of this chapter is to apply the techniques of loop quantum gravity  LQG  to cosmological spacetimes. The resulting framework is known as loop quantum cosmology  LQC . This chapter has a two-fold motivation: to highlight various developments on the theoretical and conceptual issues in the last decade in the framework of loop quantum cosmology, and to demonstrate the way these develop- ments open novel avenues for explorations of Planck scale physics and the resulting phenomenological implications.  From the theoretical viewpoint, cosmological spacetimes provide a very useful stage to make signiﬁcant progress on many conceptual and technical problems in quantum gravity. These geometries have the advantage of being highly symmetric, since spatial homogeneity reduces the inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom to a ﬁnite number, signiﬁcantly simplifying the quantization of these spacetimes. Dif- ﬁcult challenges and mathematical complexities still remain, but they are easier to overcome than in more general situations. The program of canonical quan- tization of the gravitational degrees of freedom of cosmological spacetimes dates back to Wheeler and De Witt [1, 2]. In recent years, LQC has led to signiﬁcant insights and progress in quantization of these mini-superspace cosmological mod- els and fundamental questions have been addressed. These include: whether and how the classical singularities are avoided by quantum gravitational eﬀects; how a smooth continuum spacetime emerges from the underlying quantum theory; how quantum gravitational eﬀects modify the classical dynamical equations; the prob- lem of time and inner product; quantum probabilities; etc.  see [3–8] for reviews in the subject . Spacetimes where detailed quantization has been performed include Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker  FLRW  [9–11, 13–23], Bianchi [24–30] and Gowdy models [31–34], the latter with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. A  183   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 184  184  I. Agullo & P. Singh  coherent picture of singularity resolution and Planck scale physics has emerged based on a rigorous mathematical framework, complemented with powerful numer- ical techniques. This new paradigm has provided remarkable insights on quantum gravity, and allowed a systematic exploration of the physics of the very early uni- verse. On the other hand, simpliﬁcations also entail limitations. Since the formu- lation and the resulting physics is most rigorously studied in the mini-superspace setting, it is natural to question its robustness when inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom are present, and whether the framework captures the implications from the full quantum theory. The problem of relating a model with more degrees of freedom to its symmetry reduced version is present even at the mini-superspace level. In this setting important insights have been gained on the relation between the loop quantization of Bianchi-I spacetime and spatially ﬂat  k = 0  isotropic model, which provide useful lessons to relate quantization of spacetimes with diﬀer- ent number of degrees of freedom [26]. Moreover, the Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz  BKL  conjecture [35] — that the structure of the spacetime near the singularities is determined by the time derivatives and spatial derivatives become negligible, which is substantiated by rigorous mathematical and numerical results [36, 37], alleviates some of these concerns and provides a support to the quantum cosmology program. Finally, recently there has been some concrete progress on the relation between LQC and full LQG, discussed brieﬂy in Section 6. From the phenomenological per- spective, we are experiencing a fascinating time in cosmology. The observational results of WMAP [38] and PLANCK [39] satellites have provided strong evidence for a primordial origin of the CMB temperatures anisotropies. There is no doubt that the excitement in early universe cosmology is going to continue for several more years, providing a promising opportunity to test implications of quantum gravity in cosmological observations.  This chapter provides a review, including the most recent advances, of loop quantization of cosmological spacetimes and phenomenological consequences. It is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of loop quantization of the spatially ﬂat, isotopic and homogeneous model sourced with a massless scalar ﬁeld. This model was the ﬁrst example of the rigorous quantization of a cosmological spacetime in LQC [9–11]. Because the quantization strategy underlying this model has been implemented for spacetimes with spatial curvature, anisotropies and also in presence of inhomogeneities, we discuss it in more detail. After laying down the classical framework in Ashtekar variables, we discuss the kinematical and dynam- ical features of loop quantization and the way classical singularity is resolved and replaced by a bounce. This section also brieﬂy discusses the eﬀective continuum spacetime description which provides an excellent approximation to the underlying quantum dynamics for states which are sharply peaked. For a speciﬁc choice of lapse, equal to the volume, and for the case of a massless scalar ﬁeld one obtains an exactly solvable model of LQC  sLQC  which yields important robustness results on the quantum bounce [12]. In Section 3, we brieﬂy discuss the generalization of   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 185  Loop Quantum Cosmology  185  loop quantization and the resulting Planck scale physics to spacetimes with spa- tial curvature, Bianchi, and Gowdy models. Section 4 is devoted to cosmological perturbations. We review the formulation of a quantum gravity extension of the standard theory of gauge invariant cosmological perturbations in LQC. These tech- niques provide the theoretical arena to study the origin of matter and gravitational perturbations in the early universe. This is the goal of Section 5 where we sum- marize the LQC extension of the inﬂationary scenario and discuss the quantum gravity corrections to physical observables [41–43]. Due to space limitations, it is diﬃcult to cover various topics and details in this chapter. These include the earlier developments in LQC [44–46], the path integral formulation of LQC [47], entropy bounds [48], consistent quantum probabilities [49–53], application to black hole interiors [54–59], and various mathematical [60–63] and numerical results [64–66] in LQC. Issues with inverse triad modiﬁcations [10, 11], limitations of the earlier quantizations in LQC and the role of ﬁducial scalings [11, 67, 68], and issues related to quantization ambiguities and the resulting physical eﬀects [69, 70] are also not discussed. For a review of some of these developments and issues in LQC, we refer the reader to Ref. [3] and the above cited references. We are also unable to cover all the current approaches to studying LQC eﬀects on cosmological perturbations; see [71–84] for diﬀerent approaches to that problem. Further information can be found in Chapter 8, and in the review articles [3, 4, 8, 85–87]. Related to LQC, there have been developments in spin foams and group ﬁeld theory, for which we refer the reader to Refs. [88, 89]. Our convention for the metric signature is − + ++, we set c = 1 but keep G and  cid:2  explicit in our expressions, to emphasize gravitational and quantum eﬀects. When numerical values are shown, we use Planck units.  2. Loop Quantization of Spatially Flat Isotropic and Homogeneous  Spacetime  In this section, we illustrate the key steps in loop quantization of homogeneous cosmological models using the example of spatially ﬂat FLRW spacetime sourced with a massless scalar ﬁeld φ. Though simple, this model is rich in physics and pro- vides a blueprint for the quantization of models with spatial curvature, anisotropies and other matter ﬁelds. Loop quantization of this spacetime was ﬁrst performed in Refs. [9–11] where a rigorous understanding of the quantum Hamiltonian con- straint, the physical Hilbert space and the Dirac observables was obtained, and detailed physical predictions were extracted using numerical simulations. It was soon realized that this model can also be solved exactly [12]. This feature serves as an important tool to test the robustness of the physical predictions obtained using numerical simulations. In the following, in Section 2.1, we begin with the quantization of this cosmological model in the volume representation. We discuss the classical and the quantum framework, and the main features of the quantum dynamics. We also brieﬂy discuss the eﬀective spacetime description which captures   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 186  186  I. Agullo & P. Singh  the quantum dynamics in LQC for sharply peaked states to an excellent approxi- mation and provides a very useful arena to understand various phenomenological implications. The exactly solvable model is discussed in Section 2.2.  2.1. Loop Quantum Cosmology: k = 0 Model  In the following, we outline the classical and the quantum framework of LQC in the spatially ﬂat isotropic and homogeneous spacetime following the analysis of Refs. [9–11]. In literature this quantization is also known as ‘¯μ quantization’ or ‘improved dynamics’ [11]. In the ﬁrst part we introduce the connection variables, establish their relationship with the metric variables, ﬁnd the classical Hamiltonian constraint in the metric and the connection variables and obtain the singular clas- sical trajectories in the relational dynamics expressing volume as a function of the internal time φ. This is followed by the quantum kinematics, properties of the quan- tum Hamiltonian constraint in the geometric  volume  representation, the physical Hilbert space and a summary of the physical predictions. A comparison with the Wheeler-DeWitt theory is also provided both at the kinematical and the dynamical level. An eﬀective description of the quantization performed here, following the analysis of Refs. [90, 91] is discussed in Section 2.1.3.  2.1.1. Classical framework  The spatially ﬂat homogeneous and isotropic spacetime is typically considered with a spatial topology R3 or of a 3-torus T3. For the non-compact spatial manifold extra care is needed to introduce the symplectic structure in the canonical framework because of the divergence of the spatial integrals. For the non-compact case one introduces a ﬁducial cell V, which acts as an infra-red regulator [11]. Physical implications must be independent of the choice of this regulator, which is the case for the present analysis.a Such a cell is not required for the compact topology. The spacetime metric is given by  ds2 = −dt2 + a2 ˚qabdxadxb   1   where t is the proper time, a denotes the scale factor of the universe and ˚qab denotes the ﬁducial metric on the spatial manifold.With the matter source as the massless scalar ﬁeld which serves as a physical clock in our analysis, instead of proper time it is natural to introduce a harmonic time τ satisfying  cid:2 τ = 0 since φ satisﬁes the wave equation  cid:2 φ = 0. This corresponds to the choice of the lapse N = a3. The spacetime metric then becomes  ds2 = −a6dτ 2 + a2  dx2   2  In terms of the physical spatial metric qab = a2˚qab, the physical volume of the spatial manifold is V = a3Vo, where Vo is the comoving volume of the ﬁducial cell aThis is not true for the earlier quantization in LQC [10, 46], and the lattice reﬁned models [92]. For a detailed discussion of these diﬃculties in other quantization prescriptions we refer the reader to Refs. [11, 67].  3  .  1 + dx2  2 + dx2   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 187  Loop Quantum Cosmology  187   3    4    5   in case the topology is R3, or the comoving volume of T3 in case the topology is compact.  Due to the underlying symmetries of this spacetime, the spatial diﬀeomorphism constraint is satisﬁed and the only non-trivial constraint is the Hamiltonian con- straint. Let us ﬁrst obtain this constraint in the metric variables. In such a formu- lation, the canonical pair of gravitational phase space variables consists of the scale  factor a and its conjugate p a  = −a ˙a, with ‘dot’ denoting derivative with respect to the proper time. These variables satisfy {a, p a } = 4πG 3Vo. The matter phase space variables are φ and p φ  = V ˙φ, which satisfy {φ, p φ } = 1. In terms of the  metric variables, the Hamiltonian constraint is given by ≈ 0 ,  p2  a V a4 +  p2  φ  2V  8πG  which yields the classical Friedman equation in terms of the energy density, ρ = p2  φ  2V 2, for the spatially ﬂat FRW model:  CH = − 3  cid:24    cid:25 2  ˙a a  =  8πG  3  ρ .  In order to obtain the classical Hamiltonian constraint in terms of the variables used in LQG: the Ashtekar-Barbero SU 2  connection Ai a and the conjugate triad Ea i , we ﬁrst notice that due to the symmetries of the isotropic and homogeneous spacetime, the connection Ai  a and triad Ea a, Ea ˚ωi  −1 3 o  i can be written as [46] −2 3 i = p V o  ˚q ˚ea  i ,  Ai  a = c V   cid:2   o  i and ˚ωi  a2 and c = γV 1 3  where c and p denote the isotropic connection and triad, and ˚ea a are the ﬁducial triads and co-triads compatible with the ﬁducial metric ˚qab. The canonically conjugate pair  c, p  satisﬁes {c, p} = 8πGγ 3, and is related to the metric variables as p = V 2 3 ˙a N , where γ is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter in LQG, whose value is set to γ ≈ 0.2375 using black hole thermodynamics [93]. The modulus sign over the triad arises because of the two possible orientations, the choice of which does not aﬀect physics in the absence of fermions. It is important to note that the above relation between the triad and the scale factor is true kinematically, whereas the relation between the isotropic connection and the time derivative of the scale factor is true only for the physical solutions of GR.  o  It turns out that in the quantum theory, it is more convenient to work with  variables b and v which are deﬁned in terms of c and p as [12]:  c p 1  b :=   6  where sgn p  is ±1 depending on whether the physical and ﬁducial triads have the same orientation  + , or the opposite  - . The conjugate variables b and v satisfy {b, v} = 2γ, and in terms of which the classical Hamiltonian constraint becomes  , v := sgn p   ,  2  2  p 3 2πG  CH = − 3  4γ2 b2v +  p2  φ   4πGv ≈ 0 .   7    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 188  188  I. Agullo & P. Singh  For a given value of p φ  and for a given triad orientation, Hamilton’s equations yield an expanding and a contracting trajectory, given by  φ = ± 1√  ln  + φc  v vc  12πG   8   where vc and φc are integration constants. Both trajectories encounter a singularity. In the classical theory, the existence of a singularity either in past of the expanding branch or in the future of the contracting branch is thus inevitable.  2.1.2. Quantum framework   cid:3    cid:4   μc 2   cid:3    cid:4   μc 2  τk  To pass to the quantum theory, the strategy is to promote the classical phase vari- ables and the classical Hamiltonian constraint to their quantum operator analogs. For the metric variables, this strategy leads to the Wheeler-DeWitt quantum cos- mology. Since, we wish to obtain a loop quantization of the cosmological spacetimes based on LQG we cannot use the same strategy for the connection-triad variables. In LQG, variables used for quantization are the holonomies of the connection Ai a along edges, and the ﬂuxes of the triads along 2-surfaces.  See Chapter 1.  For the homogeneous spacetimes, the latter turn out to be proportional to the triad [46]. The holonomy of the symmetry reduced connection Ai a along a straight edge ˚ea k with ﬁducial length μ is,  h μ  k = cos  I + 2 sin   9   where I is a unit 2×2 matrix and τk = −iσk 2, where σk are the Pauli spin matrices.  Due to the symmetries of the homogeneous spacetime, the holonomy and ﬂux are thus captured by functions Nμ c  := eiμc 2 of c, and the triads p respectively. Since μ can take arbitrary values, Nμ are almost periodic functions of the connection c. The next task is to ﬁnd the appropriate representation of the abstract  cid:26 -algebra generated by almost periodic functionsb of the connection c: eiμc 2, and the triads p. It turns out that there exists a unique kinematical representation of algebra generated by these functions in LQC [95–97]. This result has parallels with existence of a unique irreducible representation of the holonomy-ﬂux algebra in full LQG  [98, 99]. The gravitational sector of the kinematical Hilbert space Hkin underlying  this representation in LQC is a space of square integrable functions on the Bohr compactiﬁcation of the real line: L2 RBohr, dμBohr  [46]. Use of holonomies in place of connections does not directly aﬀect the matter sector. For this reason, the matter sector of the kinematical Hilbert space is obtained by following the methods in the Fock quantization.c It is important to note the diﬀerence between the gravitational part of Hkin, and the one obtained by following the Wheeler-DeWitt procedure  bA continuous function F of an unrestricted real variable x is almost periodic if F  x + τ   = F  x  holds to an arbitrary accuracy for inﬁnitely many values of τ , such that translations τ are spread over the whole real line without arbitrarily large intervals [94]. cPolymer quantization of matter sector in a similar setting has been studied in some of the works, see for eg. [100–102].

In LQC, the normalizable states are the countable sum of Nμ, which satisfy:  cid:8 NμN  cid:9  = δμμ cid:2  , where δμμ cid:2  is a Kronecker delta. This is in contrast to the Wheeler-DeWitt theory where one obtains a Dirac delta. Thus, the kinematical Hilbert space in LQC is fundamentally diﬀerent from one in the Wheeler-DeWitt theory. The intersection between the kinematical Hilbert space in LQC and the Wheeler-DeWitt theory consists only of the zero function. Since the system has only a ﬁnite degree of freedom, one may wonder why the von-Neumann uniqueness theorem, which leads to a unique Schr¨odinger representation in quantum mechanics, does not hold. It turns out that for the theorem to be applicable in LQC, Nμ should be weakly continuous in μ. This condition is not met in LQC, and the von-Neumann theorem is bypassed.  For further details on this issue, we refer the reader to Ref. [103].   The action of the operators ˆNμ and ˆp on states Ψ c  is by multiplication and diﬀerentiation respectively. On the states in the triad representation labelled by eigenvalues μ of ˆp , the action of ˆNμ is translational: ˆNζ Ψ μ  = Ψ μ + ζ ,   10   where ζ is a constant,d and ˆp acts as:  ˆp Ψ μ  =  μΨ μ  .  8πγl2 Pl  6  Before we proceed to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint, we note that the change in the orientation of the triads which does not lead to any physical consequences in the absence of fermions corresponds to a large gauge transformation by a parity operator ˆΠ which acts on Ψ μ  as: ˆΠΨ μ  = Ψ −μ . The physical states in the ab- sence of fermions are therefore required to be symmetric, satisfying Ψ μ  = Ψ −μ . To obtain the dynamics in the quantum theory, we start with the Hamiltonian i and the ﬁeld strength of the connection  constraint in full LQG in terms of triads Ea Fab  k:e      cid:29   Cgrav = −γ  −2  C d3x  N  det q   2  cid:4 ij  kEa  i Eb j  k  Fab  − 1   cid:30   which in terms of the symmetry reduced triads and lapse N = a3 becomes,  The ﬁeld strength F k quette  cid:2 ij with length ¯μV 1 3 ab = −2 F k  o  ab is expressed in terms of the holonomies over a square pla-  in the i − j plane spanned by ﬁducial triads:  Cgrav = γ  −2 V  −1 3 o   cid:4 i  jk ˚ea  i ˚eb j  k .  p2Fab  cid:25    cid:24   lim  Ar cid:2 →0  Tr  − I  h cid:2 ij Ar cid:2  τ k  a ˚ωj ˚ωi b .  dNote that we have used Nζ instead of Nμ to avoid confusion with the argument of the wave function Ψ μ . eThe Hamiltonian constraint consists of Ki [a  abEaj Ebk and a capture the extrinsic curvature.

Singh  j  of  the  the  area   h¯μ i    −1 h¯μ j    square plaquette,  Here Ar cid:2  denotes = −1, with ¯μ denoting the physical edge length of the plaquette h ¯μ  i h ¯μ  in the given state. Note that due to the underlying quantum geometry, the limit Ar cid:2  → 0 in  14  does not exist in the quantum theory. Instead one has to shrink √ the area of the loop to the minimum non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator in LQG. We denote this minimum area to be Δl2 Pl where Δ = 4 3πγ [26]. This results in the following functional dependence of ¯μ on the triad [11]  and h cid:2 ij  ¯μ2 =  Δl2 p Pl  ,   15   where we have used the expression for the physical area of the loop which equals ¯μ2p. Due to this form of ¯μ, the action of N¯μ on the triad eigenstates is not by a simple translation. However, switching to the volume representation gives the simple translation action, and therefore in the quantum theory it is more convenient to work with this representation in which the action of the conjugate operator  cid:3 exp iλb   with λ2 = Δl2  Pl  and the volume operator is:   cid:3 exp iλb ν cid:9  = ν − 2λ cid:9 ,  ˆV ν cid:9  = 2πγl2  νν cid:9   Pl   16   where ν = v γ cid:2 . Using these operators, we can ﬁnd the solutions to ˆCHΨ ν, φ  = ˆCgrav + 16πG ˆCmattΨ ν, φ  = 0. For the massless scalar ﬁeld as the matter source, the quantum constraint equation results in the following:  ∂2 φ Ψ ν, φ  = 3πG ν  sin λb  sin λb  ν  λ  λ  Ψ ν, φ  =: − ΘΨ ν, φ    17   where Θ is a positive deﬁnite, second order diﬀerence operator:  ΘΨ ν, φ  := − 3πG  4λ2 ν   ν + 2λ Ψ ν + 4λ  − 2νΨ ν, φ  +  ν − 2λ Ψ ν − 4λ   .   18  The form of the quantum constraint turns out to be very similar to the Klein- Gordon theory, where φ plays the role of time and Θ acts like a spatial Laplacian operator. As in the Klein-Gordon theory, the physical states can be either positive or the negative frequency solutions. Without any loss of generality we choose the physical states to be solutions of the ‘positive frequency’ square root of the quantum constraint:  −i ∂φΨ ν, φ  =  Θ Ψ ν, φ  .  √  The inner product for these physical states can be obtained using group averaging [104–106], and is given by   cid:8 Ψ1Ψ2 cid:9  =  ¯Ψ1 ν, φo ν−1Ψ ν2, φo  .   19    20    cid:8   ν  To extract physical predictions, we introduce Dirac observables which are self- adjoint with respect to the above inner product. One of the Dirac observables is   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 191  Loop Quantum Cosmology  191  ˆp φ  which is a constant of motion. The other is ˆV φ, the volume at internal time  φ. On states Ψ ν, φ , the action of these observables is  ˆV φo Ψ ν, φ  = 2πγl2  Pl ei  √ Θ φ−φo νΨ ν, φo   ˆpφΨ ν, φ  = −i cid:2  ∂φ Ψ ν, φ  =  cid:2   √ ΘΨ ν, φ  .   21    22   and  Note that the Dirac observables preserve the positive and negative frequency sub- spaces. The symmetric wave functions which satisfy equation  18  have support on a lattice ν = ± cid:4  + 4nλ with  cid:4  ∈ [0, 4λ . Any subspace spanned by the wave functions labelled by  cid:4  is preserved under evolution and the action of the Dirac ob- servables. Therefore, there is a superselection and it suﬃces to consider states with a particular value of  cid:4 . Further, physical predictions are insensitive to the choice of the lattice parameter. In the following analysis we choose  cid:4  = 0, since this choice of lattice parameter results in the possibility of the evolution encountering the classical singularity at the zero volume. Any other value of  cid:4  can also be chosen, say  cid:4  = 0.1, however in such case zero volume does not lie on support of the eigenfunctions of the Θ operator.  Before we discuss some of the key features of the quantum Hamiltonian con- straint in LQC and the resulting physics, we note that a similar analysis goes through for the Wheeler-DeWitt theory based on the metric variables. At a kine- matical level, the Wheeler-DeWitt Hilbert space consists of wave functions Ψ a, φ  on which the scale factor and φ operators act multiplicatively, and the operators corresponding to their conjugate variables act as diﬀerential operators. The physi-  cal states are found by promoting CH  3  to an operator and solving ˆCH Ψ a, φ  = 0.  The resulting quantum constraint turns out to be a diﬀerential equation [11, 12]:  ∂2 φΨ z, φ  = 12πG ∂2  z Ψ z, φ  =: −Θ Ψ z, φ    23   where z = ln a3 and Θ is the evolution operator in Wheeler-DeWitt theory. This brings out another fundamental diﬀerence between the Wheeler-DeWitt theory and LQC. Unlike the Wheeler-DeWitt theory, the quantum constraint in LQC is a discrete operator with discreteness determined by the underlying quantum geometry in LQG. For the scales where the spacetime curvature is very small compared to the Planck scale, which corresponds to the large volumes for the present model, the Θ operator in LQC approximates the Θ operator in the Wheeler-DeWitt theory [10, 46]. Thus, the continuum diﬀerential geometry is recovered from the underlying discrete quantum geometry at the small spacetime curvature.  Quantum evolution of physical states can be studied numerically using the quan- tum constraint equation  18 . One considers an initial state far away from the Planck regime, with large volumes peaked at a certain value of p φ  at a classical trajectory. Recall that in the classical theory, for a given value of p φ  there exists an expanding and a contracting trajectory which are disjoint and singular. In nu- merical simulations, the state can be either chosen such that it is peaked on the   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 192  192  I. Agullo & P.

A comparison of the quantum evolution in LQC for the volume observable  along with its dispersion  and the classical trajectories is shown. Unlike the general relativistic trajectories which lead to a singularity in the future evolution for the contracting branch and the past evolution for the expanding branch, the LQC trajectory is non-singular. The LQC trajectory bounces in the Planck regime and the loop quantum universe evolves in a non-singular way. The dispersions across the bounce are correlated, and their asymmetry depends on the method of initial state construction  see Ref. [10] for details of diﬀerent methods . The state retains its peakedness properties in the above evolution, since the relative dispersion approaches a constant value at large volumes.  expanding trajectory at late times or on the contracting trajectory at early times. Using φ as a clock, such a state, say chosen peaked on the expanding trajectory, is then numerically evolved towards the classical big bang singularity. The ﬁrst nu- merical simulations were carried out using sharply peaked Gaussian states [10, 11]. Such states were shown to remain sharply peaked on the classical expanding trajec- tory for a long time in the backward evolution, till the spacetime curvature reaches approximately a percent of the Planck curvature. At the higher curvature scales, departures between the classical trajectory and quantum evolution become signif- icant, and the loop quantum universe bounces when the energy density reaches a  maximum value ρmax ≈ 0.41ρPl [11]. After the bounce, the quantum evolution is  such that the state becomes sharply peaked on the classical contracting trajectory. Quantum gravitational eﬀects thus bridge the two singular classical trajectories providing a non-singular evolution avoiding the classical singularity. A result of the variation of volume with respect to internal time from a typical simulation is illustrated in Figure 1 where the LQC evolution is also compared with the two classical trajectories in general relativity  GR . It is clearly seen that the quantum geometric eﬀects play a role only near the bounce and quickly become negligi- ble when spacetime curvature becomes small. These studies have been recently generalized for very widely spread states and highly squeezed and non-Gaussian states which capture the evolution of more quantum universes [107, 108], using high   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 193  Loop Quantum Cosmology  193  performance computing and faster algorithms [66]. The results of quantum bounce are found to be robust for all types of states. The existence of bounce does not require any ﬁne tuning of the parameters or any special conditions. The quantum bounce is also found to be robust for slightly diﬀerent quantization prescriptions in LQC [109, 110]. In contrast to the loop quantum evolution, the quantum evolution of Wheeler-DeWitt states yields a strikingly diﬀerent picture. Initial states peaked on a classical trajectory remained peaked throughout the evolution and encounter the classical singularity. For the Wheeler-DeWitt states, the expectation values of the volume observable lie on the classical trajectory for all values of φ.  Thus, we ﬁnd that unlike in the Wheeler-DeWitt theory, in LQC classical singu- larities are replaced by the bounce. The existence of bounce is tied to the underlying discrete quantum geometry — a feature which is absent in the Wheeler-DeWitt the- ory. The quantum evolution for various states in LQC illustrates the way classical GR is recovered in the low crvature regime. Thus, LQC not only provides a non- singular ultra-violet extension of the classical cosmological models, but also leads to the desired infra-red limit. Finally, we note that this feature provides an impor- tant criterion to single out the ¯μ quantization as performed in the above analysis of the various possible choices [67, 68]. In particular, it is useful to note that in the earlier quantization of LQC, called the μo scheme in literature, edge lengths of the loop over which holonomies were constructed did not take into account the physical geometry but were kept constant [10, 46]. It does not yield the correct infra-red limit and can lead to ‘quantum gravitational eﬀects’ at arbitrarily small spacetime curvatures [10, 11, 67]. These diﬃculties are shared by the lattice reﬁned models [92]. It is interesting to note that the conclusion that ¯μ quantization [11] is the only consistent quantization in LQC is not solely tied to the infra-red limit of the theory. This conclusion can also be reached by demanding that the physical predictions be invariant under the rescalings of the ﬁducial cell [67], by demanding the stability of the quantum diﬀerence equation [64, 65, 111, 112] and by demanding that the factor ordering ambiguities in gravitational part of the quantum constraint in LQC disappear in the limit where Wheeler-DeWitt theory is approached [113]. All these independent arguments provide a robust understanding of the viability of the ¯μ quantization of the cosmological spacetimes.  2.1.3. Eﬀective spacetime description  In Section 2.1.2 we discussed the way underlying quantum geometry in LQG results in a quantum diﬀerence equation in LQC. Evolution of states with this diﬀerence equation predict a quantum bounce at the Planck scale. The question we are in- terested in now is whether it is possible to capture the key features of the quantum evolution, including the quantum bounce, in a continuum spacetime description at an eﬀective level, allowing an  cid:2 -dependence in the metric coeﬃcients. If so, is it possible to obtain a modiﬁed diﬀerential Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations which incorporate the leading quantum gravitational eﬀects? If such a set of reliable   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 194  194  I. Agullo & P. Singh  quantum-gravity-corrected equations exist, then the exploration of phenomenologi- cal implications would become much simpler numerically, within the approximations and caveats underlying these equations. Note however that, while physics obtained from such an eﬀective spacetime description can provide important insights on the underlying quantum geometry, it is imperative to rigorously conﬁrm the implica- tions using full quantum dynamics in LQC whereever possible. It turns out that for states which satisfy certain semi-classicality requirements and lead to a universe which is macroscopic at late times, an eﬀective continuum spacetime description of the loop quantum dynamics can indeed be derived using a geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics [114, 115]. It provides an eﬀective Hamiltonian from which a modiﬁed Friedmann equation can be obtained. The result is an eﬀective dynam- ical trajectory which turns out to be in an excellent agreement with the quantum dynamics for the sharply peaked states [10, 11, 107]. In the following we brieﬂy summarize the underlying method of deriving the eﬀective dynamics following the analysis of Refs. [90, 91], obtain the modiﬁed Friedmann equation for the massless scalar ﬁeld model, and discuss its main features. Various phenomenological impli- cations of this modiﬁed Friedmann dynamics have been extensively discussed in the literature  see Ref. [3] for a review , a couple of which will be discussed brieﬂy in Section 3.  In the geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics [114, 115], one treats the space of quantum states as an inﬁnite dimensional phase space ΓQ. The symplectic form  ΩQ  on the phase space is given by the imaginary part of the Hermitian in- ner product on the Hilbert space. The real part of the inner product determines a Riemannian metric on ΓQ. One then seeks a relation between the quantum phase space ΓQ with symplectic structure ΩQ and the classical phase space Γ with sym- plectic structure Ω. The relation is given by an embedding of the ﬁnite dimensional classical phase space onto ¯ΓQ ⊂ ΓQ. To capture the Hamiltonian ﬂow on ΓQ that  generates full quantum dynamics, one must ﬁnd an astute embedding such that the quantum Hamiltonian ﬂow is tangential to ¯ΓQ to a high degree of approximation. This requirement is very non-trivial and there is no guarantee that such an embed- ding can be found. However, if such an embedding exists then the projection of the quantum Hamiltonian ﬂow on ¯ΓQ provides the quantum corrected trajectories that capture the main quantum eﬀects to a high degree of approximation. ¯ΓQ is by construction isomorphic with the classical phase space Γ and a point in Γ is labelled by ξo ≡  qo i  . Therefore the quantum state corresponding to a point of ¯ΓQ is denoted by Ψξo . A required embedding must satisfy qi =  cid:8 Ψξo , ˆqiΨξo cid:9 , and pi =  cid:8 Ψξo , ˆpiΨξo cid:9 . To ﬁnd a suitable embedding, one makes careful choice of appropriate states Ψξo , such as coherent states, by choosing appropriate parame- ters, such as ﬂuctuations. Once ¯ΓQ is found, the leading quantum corrections are well-captured in terms of the classical phase space variables. By carrying out this procedure, one thus obtains modiﬁed classical dynamical equations  the eﬀective equations , which incorporate quantum gravitational corrections via a controlled  i , po   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 195  Loop Quantum Cosmology  195  approximation in terms of the parameters of the state. This approach to eﬀective equations is called the ‘embedding method’  Another approach is the ‘truncation method’ where one introduces a coordinate system on ΓQ using the expectation values  ¯qi, ¯pi , ﬂuctuations and the higher order moments [117, 118]. The quantum Hamiltonian ﬂow on the Hilbert space yields a set of coupled nonlinear diﬀerential equations which are inﬁnite in number for all the moments. By suitably truncating this set up to a ﬁnite number of terms, one can then obtain classical dynamical equations with quantum corrections up to the trun- cated order. In comparison to the embedding approach where appropriate states and their parameters need to be chosen carefully to obtain approximately tangential Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld, the truncation method is more systematic. However, it is diﬃcult to understand the role played by the inﬁnite number of moments which are truncated out, and the error associated with this truncation.  In LQC, eﬀective equations have been derived using the embedding [90, 91, 116] as well the truncation method [117, 118]. However, since most of the numerical studies on conﬁrming the validity of the eﬀective dynamics and phenomenological implications have been performed for the embedding method, we will focus on this approach. For the massless scalar ﬁeld, the eﬀective Hamiltonian constraint, up to the approximation where terms proportional to the square of the quantum ﬂuctuations of the state, using the embedding method is found to be [91]:  H = − 3 cid:2  C  eﬀ   4γλ2 ν sin2 λb  + ≈ 0, which yields  1  4πγl2 Pl  p2  φ  ν  .  Physical solutions satisfy C  eﬀ   H  3  8πGγ2λ2 V sin2 λb  =  p2  φ  2V  .   24    25   The modiﬁed Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations can be found using Hamil- ton’s equation for V and b respectively, which satisfy {b, V } = 4πGγ. As an example, Hamilton’s equation for volume gives,  ˙V = {V, C  eﬀ   H  C  eﬀ   H =  3 γλ  sin λb  cos λb  ,   26   from which it is straightforward to derive the modiﬁed Friedmann equation for the Hubble rate H = ˙V  3V using equation  25 :  H 2 =  8πG  3  ρ  with ρmax =  3  8πGγ2λ2 .   27   The quantum gravitational correction thus appears as a ρ2 modiﬁcation to the classical Friedmann equation  4 , with a negative sign.f The modiﬁed Raychaudhuri  fThe ρ2 modiﬁcation albeit with a positive sign in front of ρ ρmax also appears in brane world scenarios in string cosmological models. For the modiﬁcation to be negative one requires one of the extra dimensions to be time-like [119]. For a comparative analysis of the properties of the above modiﬁed Friedmann equation in LQC with the braneworld scenarios see Ref. [120, 121].  ∂ ∂b   cid:25   } = −4πGγ  cid:24   1 − ρ ρmax   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 196  196  I. Agullo & P.

Unlike the classical theory, the Hubble rate does not value Hmax = 1  2γλ  which occurs at ρ = ρmax 2. Note that the eﬀective dy-  grow unboundedly through out the evolution, but is bounded above by a maximum  From equation  2.2  one concludes that the scale factor of the universe bounces  namics predicts the bounce at the same value of energy density which is found to be the supremum of the expectation values of the energy density observable  ρsup  in exactly solvable LQC  as we shall see in equation  39  , and the value observed in various numerical simulations for the sharply peaked Gaussian states [11, 107]. For such states, the eﬀective dynamical trajectory is in excellent agreement with the quantum evolution at all scales. This may seem surprising because the initial semi-classical state used to derive the eﬀective dynamics is chosen in the regime where quantum gravitational eﬀects are negligible and near the bounce some of the underlying assumptions on the parameters of the state can be suspect [91].i A careful analysis of the underlying assumptions in the derivation of eﬀective dy- namics shows that they are satisﬁed all the way up to the bounce for the sharply peaked states [116]. Thus, for such states eﬀective dynamics provides a very reli- able continuum spacetime description of this model. For states which have large relative ﬂuctuations or have very large non-Gaussianity, numerical simulations ﬁnd departures between the quantum evolution and the eﬀective dynamics obtained from equations  2.2  and  28  [107, 108]. Interestingly, it turns out that the above eﬀective dynamics always overestimates the energy density at the bounce. This observation is consistent with the result in sLQC that the maximum value of the expectation value of energy density ρsup is same as ρmax, and the bounce density for certain states in the quantum theory can be smaller [125, 126]. An insight from  gAn interesting relation between this modiﬁed Raychaudhuri equation and the resulting structure of the canonical phase space has been explored as an inverse problem [121], without any a priori assumptions about the Hamiltonian framework. It has been suggested that existence of Ray- chaudhuri equation with such modiﬁcations, quadratic or higher order in energy density, requires holonomies of the connection as phase space variables. hStrictly speaking this is true only when the Hamiltonian constraint does not contain any terms which include the inverse triad modiﬁcations which due to the choice of lapse are absent in our case. For models where such modiﬁcations can be consistently incorporated, such as in the k = 1 model, the conservation law is also modiﬁed [122, 123]. iIt has been argued that for the non-compact topology, in the limit of removal of infra-red regulator quantum ﬂuctuations do not aﬀect the eﬀective Hamiltonian [124]. However, this argument does not provide an answer to the puzzle about the validity of the eﬀective dynamics at the bounce as discussed in the literature [91], since the apparently failing assumptions which are problematic are ﬂuctuation independent [116].   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 197  Loop Quantum Cosmology  197  sLQC is that for the case of a spatially ﬂat model with a massless scalar ﬁeld, the modiﬁed Friedman equation  2.2  can be generalized to arbitrary states in the physical Hilbert space with ρmax replaced with the expectation value of the energy density observable at the bounce [127].  Eﬀective dynamics has provided many important insights on the physics at the Planck scale in LQC. Using eﬀective equations, a relationship of eﬀective Hamilto- nian in LQC with a covariant eﬀective action containing inﬁnite number of higher or- der curvature terms has been explored [128]. An extensive understanding is reached on genericity of singularity resolution and occurrence of inﬂation. For generic mat- ter the above bound on the Hubble rate leads to the resolution of strong curvature singularities [129–132], and the bounce dynamics plays an important role to make the probability for inﬂation close to unity in LQC [133–136]. We discuss some of the applications of eﬀective dynamics in Section 3. For a more complete discussion of various phenomenological implications we refer the reader to Ref. [3].  2.2. Solvable Loop Quantum Cosmology  sLQC   The spatially ﬂat loop quantum cosmological model with a massless scalar ﬁeld can be solved exactly by passing to the b  the conjugate to volume  representa- tion [12]. The exact solvability of this model proves extremely important to test the robustness of various physical implications obtained in Section 2.1. Another advantage of this analysis is that similarities and diﬀerences between LQC and the Wheeler-DeWitt theory become very transparent. In both frameworks, the under- lying exactly soluble models are very similar, such as in the form of the quantum constraint and the action of momentum observable. But, there are also some im- portant distinctions, in particular on the behavior of the expectation values of the volume. This diﬀerence is pivotal in proving some important results, including the genericness of quantum bounce in sLQC and the occurrence of the singularity in the Wheeler-DeWitt theory. Due to its simplicity and powerful features, sLQC has been widely applied in diﬀerent settings to gain important insights on diﬀerent problems in LQC, e.g.,  i  to understand the growth of ﬂuctuations for various states across the bounce [125, 126, 137, 138],  ii  to develop a path integral formu- lation of LQC to understand various conceptual issues and explore links with spin foam models [47, 140, 141], and,  iii  to understand the quantum probabilities for the occurrence of the bounce in LQC [50, 51] and singularities in Wheeler-DeWitt theory [49] using the consistent histories framework [142, 143]. Due to space limita- tions it is not possible for us to elaborate on these various interesting applications in detail, and refer the interested reader to the review [3].  In LQC, since the wave functions in the volume representation have support on a discrete interval ν = 4nλ, the wave functions Ψ b, φ  in the b representation have support on the continuous interval  0, π λ . In contrast, in the Wheeler-DeWitt theory b ∈  −∞,∞ . In both the theories, the quantum Hamiltonian constraint in the b representation is a diﬀerential equation. Let us start with sLQC, where it is   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 198  198  given by  χ b, φ  . It is convenient to change the variable to x with x ∈  −∞,∞ :  ∂2 φ χ b, φ  = 12πG  ∂b  λ  I. Agullo & P.

As in the case of the volume representation, the physical Hilbert space consists of the positive frequency solutions which satisfy −i∂φχ x, φ  = Θχ x, φ . Further, the requirement that the physics be invariant under the change of the orientation of the triads leads to χ x, φ  = −χ −x, φ . Due to this antisymmetric condition, it turns out that every solution χ x, φ  can be expressed in terms of the right  x−   F  x+  − F  x−   where x± = φ ± x. and the left moving  x+  parts χ x, φ  = 1√ The physical inner product can be obtained in terms of the left moving  or the right moving  part as:   31   √  2   χ1, χ2 phys = −2i  dx ¯F1 x+ ∂xF2 x+  .   32    cid:5  ∞  −∞  A similar construction can be carried out for the Wheeler-DeWitt theory, where, −1 2 ln b bo  unlike sLQC, the resulting wave functions χ y, φ , where y =  12πG  with bo an arbitrary constant, are not subject to the requirement that they must have support on the left and right moving sectors. In the Wheeler-DeWitt theory, these sectors decouple and one can choose wave functions composed solely of the left moving or the right moving solutions. Otherwise, the form of the quantum constraint, and the action of the momentum observable are identical. However, a crucial diﬀerence appears in the expectation value of the volume observable. For sLQC it turns out to be   χ, ˆV φχ phy = 2πγl2  12πGφ + V−e Here V± are positive constants determined by the initial state:  Pl  χ,ˆνφχ phy = V+e  −√  12πGφ.   33   V± =  √ 4πγl2  Plλ 12πG  dx+  −∞  ∓√  e  12πGx+.

The left moving modes, which correspond to the expanding trajectory, thus encounter a big bang singularity in the past. Similarly, the right moving modes encounter a big crunch singularity in the future evolution. Note that this conclusion does not assume any proﬁle of the initial state in this theory. An analysis of the quantum probabilities using consistent histories approach shows that the probability for a singularity to occur in this Wheeler-DeWitt model in asymptotic past of future is unity [49], even for the states composed of the arbitrary superpositions of the left and right moving sectors. On the other hand, in sLQC the expectation  cid:2  values of volume diverge both in asymptotic future and past  φ → ±∞ . For any arbitrary state in the physical Hilbert space,  cid:8  ˆV φ cid:9  has a minimum value Vmin = −1 ln V+ V− . 2 A consistent history analysis in sLQC yields the quantum probability for the bounce to be unity [51]. Unlike the Wheeler-DeWitt theory where big bang and big crunch singularities are inevitable, in sLQC these singularities are resolved for the generic states.  √ V+V− χ2 which is reached at the bounce time φB =  2  12πG   The ﬂuctuations of the volume and the momentum observable can be computed in a similar way, which give important insights on the evolution of the states across the bounce. This issue is tied to understanding the way detailed properties of the universe in sLQC post-bounce branch are inﬂuenced by the initial state in the pre-bounce branch  or vice versa . Using sLQC constraints on the growth of the relative ﬂuctuations have been obtained which show that a state which is semi- classical at very early times before the bounce retains its semi-classical properties after the bounce [125, 126, 137–139]. In particular, triangle inequalities relating the relative ﬂuctuations of volume and momentum provide strong constraints on degree by which the ﬂuctuations can change across the bounce [137]. These inequalities have been recently rigorously tested using extensive numerical simulations for semi- classical states as well as for states which are not sharply peaked [107, 108]. These inequalities are found to remain valid for all the numerical simulations performed till date.  Useful insights on the details of the singularity resolution in sLQC emerge on analyzing expectation values of the energy density of massless scalar ﬁeld, whose corresponding observable is  ˆρφ =    ˆAφ 2 where  ˆAφ =   ˆV φ   −1 2 ˆpφ  ˆV φ   −1 2 .  1 2  The expectation values  cid:8 ˆρφ cid:9  computed at some φ = φo is, −∞ dx∂xF2 √ −∞ dx∂xF2 cosh    cid:3   ∞   cid:8 ˆρφo   cid:9  =  8πGγ2  1 λ2  3   cid:4 2  12πGx    cid:4 2  which is bounded above by ρsup: 3  ρsup =  8πγ2Gλ2 =  32π2γ3G2 cid:2   ≈ 0.41ρPl .   cid:3   ∞  √  3   37    38    39    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 200  200  I. Agullo & P. Singh  This value is in excellent agreement with the value of energy density at the bounce obtained using numerical simulations for the states which are sharply peaked at the classical trajectory at late times [11, 107]. As pointed out earlier, for the states which are widely spread, the value of energy density at the bounce in general turns out to be less than the above value [107]. The same conclusion holds true for the states which are squeezed [108, 126] or for states with more complex waveforms [108]. Extensive numerical simulations for various kinds of states have shown that the above supremum of the energy density always holds true [107, 108].  The generic bound on the energy density is a direct consequence of the quan- tum geometry which manifests through the area gap λ2. It is also related to the ultra-violet cutoﬀ for the eigenfunctions of the evolution operator which decay ex- ponentially below the volume at which this energy density is reached. The evidence of this feature was ﬁrst found numerically [10, 11], which has been recently rigor- ously conﬁrmed using sLQC [144]. If the area gap is put to zero, the maximum of the energy density becomes inﬁnity and the ultraviolet cutoﬀ on the eigenfunctions disappears. Note that sLQC can be approximated to Wheeler-DeWitt theory for any given accuracy  cid:4  in a semi-inﬁnite interval of time φ by appropriately shrinking the area gap. However, this is not possible if the entire inﬁnite range of φ is con- sidered. Then irrespective of the choice of a ﬁnite area gap, the diﬀerences between sLQC and Wheeler-DeWitt become arbitrarily large in some range of time φ. In this sense of global time evolution, the Wheeler-DeWitt theory is not a limiting case of sLQC. It turns out that sLQC is a fundamentally discrete theory and the limit λ → 0 does not lead to a continuum theory. This feature of sLQC is not shared by the examples in polymer quantum mechanics where the continuum limit exists in the limit when the discreteness parameter vanishes [145, 146].  To summarize, sLQC has played an important role in proving the robustness of results on the bounce that were ﬁrst observed in numerical simulations within LQC. The exact solvability of this model provides many insights on the supremum of the expectation value of the energy density observable, bounds on the growth of ﬂuctuations across the bounce, and relation with the Wheeler-DeWitt theory.  3. LQC in More General Cosmological Spacetimes  In the previous section, we discussed the way quantum geometric eﬀects in LQC resolve the classical big bang big crunch singularity in the k = 0 isotropic and homo- geneous spacetime, and result in a quantum bounce of the universe near the Planck scale. This result opens a new avenue to explore and develop novel non-singular paradigms in the very early universe, and to answer fundamental questions related to the structure of the spacetime near the singularities. For this it is necessary to ex- tend the results on singularity resolution in LQC to more general settings. The goal of this section is to summarize the main developments in these directions. In Sec- tion 3.1, we start with a brief discussion on the generalization of the bounce results in diﬀerent isotropic models — with spatial curvature, cosmological constant and   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 201  Loop Quantum Cosmology  201  an inﬂationary potential, focusing in particular on the properties of the quantum evolution operator and subtle features of the loop quantization.j This is followed by a discussion of two interesting applications in eﬀective dynamics. Section 3.2 deals with the loop quantization of Bianchi models, where aspects of quantum the- ory and eﬀective dynamics of Bianchi-I model are discussed in some detail. In Section 3.3, we discuss the application of LQC techniques to the Gowdy models which have provided useful insights on the singularity resolution in the presence of inhomogeneities.  3.1. Quantization of Other Isotropic Models  In the following, in Section 3.1.1 till Section 3.1.3, we summarize some of the main features of the isotropic models in LQC which have been quantized using the pro- cedure outlined in Section 2.2. In all of these homogeneous models, one starts with the gravitational part of the classical Hamiltonian constraint in terms of the ﬂuxes and the ﬁeld strength of the connection, and express them in terms of the triads and the holonomies computed over a closed loop whose minimum area is given by λ2 = Δl2 Pl. The edge lengths of the holonomies ¯μ are functions of triads given by equation  15 . The elements of holonomies form an algebra of almost periodic functions, and their action on the states in the volume representation is by uniform translations. As in the case of the k = 0 model, one obtains a quantum diﬀer- ence equation with uniform discreteness in volume. The scalar ﬁeld plays the role of time in the quantum evolution, and one can introduce an inner product and a family of Dirac observables to extract physical predictions. Extensive numerical  simulations conﬁrm the existence of bounce which occurs at ρ ≈ 0.41ρmax for the  sharply peaked states. Eﬀective dynamics turns out to be in excellent agreement with the underlying loop quantum dynamics in all of these models. The last part of this section exhibits two applications of eﬀective dynamics, where we discuss the way eﬀective spacetime description provides important insights on the generic resolution of singularities and the naturalness of inﬂation in LQC.  3.1.1. Spatially closed model  The isotropic and homogeneous k = 1 model with a massless scalar ﬁeld provides a very useful stage to carry out precise tests on the ultra-violet and infra-red limits in LQC. This is because in the classical theory, the scale factor in k = 1 model recollapses at a value determined by the momentum p φ . In the past of the clas- sical evolution, the universe encounters a big bang singularity, and in the future it encounters a big crunch singularity. A non-singular quantum cosmological model should not only resolve both of the past and the future singularities, but must also lead to recollapse at the scales determined by the classical theory. Using the  jLoop quantization of isotropic model has also been performed in the presence of radiation. For details, we refer the reader to Ref. [23].

Singh  earlier quantization in LQC, Green and Unruh found that though the singularity is resolved, one is not able to obtain recollapse at the large scales predicted by the classical theory [147]. This limitation was tied to the unavailability of the inner product and detailed knowledge of the properties of the quantum evolution opera- tor in the earlier works. These limitations were overcome in the loop quantization of the k = 1 model with a massless scalar ﬁeld following the quantization proce- dure in the k = 0 model outlined in Section 2.2 [13, 14].k The resulting quantum Hamiltonian constraint, for lapse chosen to be N = a3, takes the following form:  φΨ ν, φ  = −Θ k=1  Ψ ν, φ  ∂2  = −ΘΨ ν, φ  +  3πG λ2 ν  sin2   cid:29    cid:24    cid:25   cid:25 2  ν   cid:30   λ   cid:24   ˜Kν1 3 λ ˜K   cid:9 o 2   cid:9 o 2  −  1 + γ2   ν1 3  Ψ ν, φ    40   where Θ k=1  is a positive deﬁnite, self-adjoint operator. In contrast to the quan- tum evolution operator Θ of the k = 0 model, Θ k=1  has a discrete spectrum. This property is tied to the behavior of the eigenfunctions of Θ k=1  which de- cay exponentially for volumes greater than the recollapse volume in the classical theory, and also below a particular value of volume when the spacetime curvature reaches Planck scale. Numerical simulations with sharply peaked Gaussian states,  and analysis of Dirac observables ˆp φ  and ˆV φ, show that the k = 1 loop quantum  universe bounces at the volume where the exponential decay of the eigenfunctions occurs in the Planck regime, with a maximum in the expectation values of energy density observable given by 0.41ρmax. The loop quantized model also recollapses at the value in excellent agreement with the classical theory. States preserve their peakedness properties through bounces and recollapses, and the quantum evolution continues forever by avoiding the big bang and big crunch singularities, providing a non-singular cyclic model of the universe. The eﬀective dynamics obtained from an eﬀective Hamiltonian constraint with a form similar to  24  provides an excellent agreement to the loop quantum dynamics at all the scales. The loop quantization of k = 1 model successfully demonstrates that in LQC not only are the classical singularities resolved, but the theory also agrees with GR with an extraordinary precision at classical scales.  3.1.2. Positive and negative cosmological constant  The case of positive cosmological constant Λ, with a massless scalar ﬁeld in the spatially ﬂat isotropic and homogeneous spacetime is interesting due to various conceptual and phenomenological reasons. In the classical theory, the model has a big bang singularity in the past, and undergoes accelerated expansion in the future evolution. The universe expands to an inﬁnite volume in an inﬁnite proper time t, but at a ﬁnite value of the scalar ﬁeld φ. Thus, in the relational dynamics with φ  kThe model has been recently quantized in a diﬀerent way following the same strategy [15].   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 203  Loop Quantum Cosmology  203  as a clock, the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld on the phase space is incomplete. With an analytical extension, the dynamical trajectories in the classical theory start from a big bang singularity at φ = −∞, and encounter a big crunch at φ = ∞ [21]. In terms of the time φ, the classical evolution thus turns out to be much richer. Following the strategy for the loop quantization of k = 0 FLRW model with a massless scalar, loop quantization can be performed rigorously, which leads to the following evolution equation [21]:  φ Ψ ν, φ  = −ΘΛ+ Ψ ν, φ  := −Θ Ψ ν, φ  + ∂2  πGγ2 Λ  2  ν 2 Ψ ν, φ  ,   41   where Λ > 0. The operator ΘΛ+ is not essentially self-adjoint, and one needs to ﬁnd its self-adjoint extensions [20, 21]. For any choice of such an extension, the spectrum of ΘΛ+ is discrete. It turns out that the details of the physics are independent of the choice of the extension for large eigenvalues of ΘΛ+. Numerical simulations with sharply peaked states show the existence of bounce when the energy density of massless scalar ﬁeld and cosmological constant becomes approximately equal to 0.41ρPl. Interestingly, for φ as a clock, inﬁnite volume is reached in ﬁnite φ. In the quantum theory, evolution continues beyond this point in relational time φ and results in a contracting trajectory. In this way, the evolution in this model mimics the cyclic universe with φ as time.  The loop quantization of k = 0 model with a massless scalar ﬁeld and a negative cosmological constant was ﬁrst discussed brieﬂy in Ref. [11], and studied in detail in Ref. [19]. As in the k = 1 model, the classical universe has a big bang singularity in the past, and a big crunch singularity in the future after the negative cosmological constant results in a recollapse in the expanding branch. In LQC, the quantum Hamiltonian constraint turns out to be,  φ Ψ ν, φ  = −ΘΛ− Ψ ν, φ  := −Θ Ψ ν, φ  − πGγ2 Λ  ∂2  ν2 Ψ ν, φ  .   42   2  The operator ΘΛ− is essentially self-adjoint with a discrete spectrum. At large eigenvalues, the spacing between the eigenvalues is nearly uniform. Sharply peaked states constructed with such eigenvalues undergo nearly cyclic evolution in LQC, avoiding the big bang singularity in the past and the big crunch singularity in the  future, with quantum bounces occurring at ρ ≈ 0.41ρPl. As in the k = 1 model,  the universe recollapses at the volume predicted by the classical theory.  3.1.3. Inﬂationary potential  In the classical theory, inﬂationary spacetimes are past incomplete [148]. A natural question is whether in LQC, one can construct non-singular inﬂationary models. The problem is challenging because of several reasons. Unlike the models considered so far, in the presence of a potential, p φ  is not a constant of motion and therefore φ does not serve as a global clock. However, φ can still be used as a local clock in portions of the pre-inﬂationary epoch where it has a monotonic behavior. For the   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 204  204  I. Agullo & P. Singh  1  2 m2φ2 potential, the loop quantization leads to the following quantum evolution equation [22],  φ Ψ ν, φ  = −Θ m  Ψ ν, φ  := − ∂2  Θ − 4πGγ2 m2φ2 ν2  Ψ ν, φ  .   43    cid:3    cid:4   Note that since Θ m  depends on time φ, obtaining the inner product becomes more subtle. The operator Θ m  is equivalent to Θ Λ+  in  41  for any ﬁxed value of φ, and hence fails to be essentially self-adjoint. For each value of φ, Θ m  admits self- adoint extensions. The physical Hilbert space can be obtained given a choice of these extensions. Numerical simulations with sharply peaked states show that the quantum evolution resolves the past singularity and results in a quantum bounce when the energy density of the inﬂaton ﬁeld reaches 0.41ρPl [22]. Further, the classical GR trajectory is recovered when the spacetime curvature becomes much smaller than the Planck value. Thus, loop quantum gravitational eﬀects make inﬂation past complete. A detailed understanding of the physics of this model and its relation to the choice of self-adjoint extensions is an open issue.  3.1.4. Some applications of the eﬀective dynamics  We now discuss two applications of the eﬀective dynamics in the isotropic model. The ﬁrst example probes the question whether singularities are generically resolved in LQC, and under what conditions, and the second example deals with the natu- ralness of the inﬂationary scenario in LQC.   Generic resolution of strong singularities: Apart from the resolution of the big bang big crunch singularities in the quantum theory, the resolution of various other types of singularities such as the big rip singularity has been achieved in the eﬀec- tive spacetime description in LQC [129, 149–152]. An important question is whether quantum geometric eﬀects resolve all the spacelike singularities, or are there certain types of singularities which are not resolved. Here it is to be noted that even in GR, not all singularities are harmful. Certain singularities even if characterized by divergences in the components of spacetime curvature, are harmless because the tidal forces turn out to be ﬁnite [153–155]. It turns out that such singularities — known as weak singularities, are not resolved in LQC [129, 156]. Such singularities are tied to the divergence in the spacetime curvature caused by the divergence in the pressure even when the energy density is bounded above. Note that for var- ious LQC spacetimes, including isotropic, anisotropic and certain Gowdy models, expansion scalar and anisotropic shear are bounded [29, 68, 157–160]. However, it is straightforward to see that LQC allows divergence of curvature invariants. A straightforward computation of Ricci scalar R from the modiﬁed Friedman  2.2  and the Raychaudhuri equation  28 , shows that if the equation of state of matter is such that P  ρ  → ±∞ at a ﬁnite value of ρ, then the Ricci scalar diverges. How- ever, geodesics can be extended beyond all such events [129]. On the other hand, strong singularities — the ones for which tidal forces are inﬁnite, are generically   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 205  Loop Quantum Cosmology  205  resolved for matter with arbitrary equation of state in the k = 0 isotropic and homogeneous model in LQC [129]. The expansion scalar of the geodesics remains bounded in the eﬀective spacetime which turns out to be geodesically complete. For the spatially curved model, a phenomenological analysis of eﬀective dynamics conﬁrms that strong singularities are resolved whereas weak singularities are ig- nored by the quantum geometric eﬀects [150]. The results on generic resolution of strong singularities have also been generalized in the presence of anisotropies in the Bianchi-I model [130, 131] and Kantowski-Sachs spacetime [132]. These results provide a strong indication that resolution of singularities may be a very generic phenomena due to the quantum gravitational eﬀects in LQC. A fundamental ques- tion is whether these results point towards a non-singularity theorem. Future work in this direction is expected to reveal an answer to this important question.   Probability for inﬂation: The inﬂationary paradigm has been extremely suc- cessful in providing a description of the early universe in the FLRW model. It is natural to ask whether it can be successfully embedded in LQC. Various inﬂation- ary models have been considered in LQC using the modiﬁed Friedman dynamics, including single ﬁeld inﬂation with m2φ2 potential [133–135, 161, 162], multi-ﬁeld in- ﬂationary models [163], tachyonic inﬂation [164], with non-minimally coupled scalar ﬁelds [165], and even in the presence of anisotropies [166]. An important question in this setting is, if we solve the spacetime dynamics in LQC starting from the evolution at the Planck era of the universe, does a phase of slow-roll inﬂation com- patible with observations appear at some time in the future evolution? If so, does this happen for generic initial conditions or only for very speciﬁc, ﬁne-tuned values of the initial data? In the context of GR, it has long been argued that inﬂationary trajectories are attractors in the space of solutions. Similar conclusions have been found in LQC [161], but existence of attractors does not tell us about the probabil- ities unless a suitable measure is deﬁned. A detailed analysis of these questions was performed in Refs. [133, 134] in a spatially ﬂat FLRW background. The authors of this reference proceed by computing the fractional volume in the space of solu- tions occupied by physical trajectories with the desired properties — an inﬂationary phase compatible with observation at some time in the evolution. But as they point out, the presence of gauge degrees of freedom makes the construction of the measure needed to compute those volumes quite subtle. The natural strategy, namely the projection of the natural Liouville measure to the reduced, or gauge ﬁxed space of solutions, produces ambiguous results — it turns out, as pointed out in [135], that this fact is the origin of disparate results in the literature [167, 168]. The ambiguity, on the other hand, can be resolved by introducing a preferred moment in time in the evolution. In GR, there is no such preferred instant, but in LQC the existence of the bounce that every trajectory experiences provides the required structure. The authors of Refs. [133, 134] use this fact to show that, by assuming a ﬂat probability distribution in the space of initial conditions for matter and geometry at the bounce   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 206  206  I. Agullo & P. Singh  time, a 99.9997% of the volume of that space corresponds to solutions that will en- counter observationally favored inﬂation during the evolution. The conclusion is therefore that the inﬂationary attractor is also present in LQC. See Ref. [136] for further explanation of the underlying reason of this attractor mechanism.  3.2. Bianchi-I Model  The Bianchi-I model is one of the simplest settings to understand the way anisotropies in the spacetime play an important role on the physics near the clas- sical singularities. Due to an interplay of the Ricci and Weyl components of the spacetime curvature, the structure of the singularities is very rich in comparison to the isotropic models. The spacetime metric of the Bianchi-I model is given by  ds2 = −dt2 + a2  1dx2  1 + a2  2dx2  2 + a2  3dx2 3,   44   where ai denote the directional scale factors. Unlike the isotropic models, where the big bang singularity is characterized by the universe shrinking to a point of zero scale factor, the big bang singularity in the anisotropic models in GR can be of the shape of a cigar, a pancake, a barrel or a point depending on the behavior of the  directional scale factors, captured by the Kasner exponents ki, deﬁned via ai ∝ tki .  It turns out that in general, unless one considers matter which has an equation of state, given by the ratio of the pressure and the energy density, to be greater than or equal to unity, the approach to the singularity is dictated by the anisotropic shear. In more general situations, such as in the Bianchi-IX models where the presence of spatial curvature leads to even richer dynamics, the approach to the singularity is oscillatory in the Kasner exponents and leads to the Mixmaster behavior [36]. According to the BKL conjecture, in the inhomogeneous spacetimes the approach to the singularity is such that the spatial derivatives can be ignored in comparison to the time derivatives, and each point of the space asymptotically behaves as in the Bianchi-IX model [35]. Thus, understanding the way singularity resolution occurs in Bianchi models is very important to understand singularity resolution in general. In LQC, a quantization of Bianchi-I [26], Bianchi-II [27] and Bianchi-IX mod- els [28, 29] has been performed which leads to a non-singular quantum constraint equation. However, physical implications in the quantum theory in terms of the expectation values of Dirac observables have only been studied for the Bianchi-I vacuum model [25] for an earlier quantization [24, 169].l Various interesting results on the physics of the Bianchi models have been obtained using eﬀective dynamics, which include existence of Kasner transitions across the bounce in Bianchi-I model [138], existence of inﬂationary attractors [68], constructing non-singular cyclic mod- els in the Ekpyrotic scenario [170], generic bounds on geometric scalars [68] and the resolution of strong curvature singularities [130, 131]. In the following, we outline  lThis quantization has some limitations related to the dependence of physical predictions on the shape of the ﬁducial cell which is introduced to deﬁne symplectic structure [26, 68]. Nevertheless, it is consistent when the spatial topology is a 3-torus and provides important insights on the physics at the Planck scale and the nature of bounce in Bianchi-I model.

[26], and discuss some of the features of the eﬀective dynamics. For details of the loop quantization and the resulting physics of Bianchi-II and Bianchi-IX space- times, we refer the readers to the original works [27–29, 157, 159, 169, 171–173].  Utilizing the symmetries of the spatial manifold, which as in the k = 0 isotropic model can be of R3 or T3 topology, the Ashtekar-Barbero connection and the den- sitized triad in the Bianchi-I model can be written as  Ai  a = ci Li   −1˚ωi  a, and Ea  −1 i = piLiV o  ˚q ˚ea  i ,   45    cid:2   where ci and pi are the symmetry reduced connections and triads and Li denote the coordinate lengths of the ﬁducial cell in the case of R3 topology. For the T3 topology, one does not need to introduce a ﬁducial cell and Li can be set to 2π. Note that the coordinate volume Vo = L1L2L3 with respect to the ﬁducial metric ˚qab changes if the individual Li are rescaled. In the classical theory, physics is invariant under the change in the rescalings in Li. This also turns out to be true for the loop quantization of the Bianchi-I model discussed here.m The triad components are related to the directional scale factors as  p1 = ε1 L2L3 a2a3, p2 = ε2L1L3 a1a3, p3 = ε3L1L2 a1a2 ,   46   where εi = ±1 depending on the triad orientation. For the massless scalar ﬁeld,  the classical Hamiltonian constraint in terms of the symmetry reduced variables for lapse N = a1a2a3, is given by  CH = − 1  8πGγ2  c1p1 c2p2 + c3p3 c1p1 + c2p2 c3p3  +  p2  φ  2  ≈ 0 .  Using Hamilton’s equations, one ﬁnds that  cipi − cjpj = V  Hi − Hj  = γκij ,  where κij is a constant antisymmetric matrix, and Hi denote the directional Hubble rates Hi = ˙ai ai.  To understand the dynamical evolution, it is useful to introduce the mean Hubble rate and the shear scalar in this model. These are kinematically obtained from the trace and the symmetric tracefree parts of the expansion tensor deﬁned as the covariant derivative of the timelike vector ﬁeld tangential to the geodesics. The mean Hubble rate and the shear scalar in the Bianchi-I spacetime are:  H =   H1 + H2 + H3  , and σ2 =   H1 − H2 2 +  H2 − H3 2 +  H3 − H1 2  ,  1 3   cid:6   1 3  where H = ˙a a with a =  a1a2a3 1 3.  mIn the earlier quantization prescription [24, 25], the resulting physics is not invariant under the change in shape of the ﬁducial cell if the topology is non-compact [26, 68].   47    48    cid:7    49    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 208  208  I. Agullo & P. Singh  In the classical theory, using equation  48 , the shear Σ2 := σ2V 2 6 turns out to be a constant.n The Hamilton’s equations for the triads, yield the generalized Friedman equation:  H 2 =  8πG  3  ρ +  Σ2 a6 .   50   At the classical big bang singularity, the mean Hubble rate, energy density of the scalar ﬁeld ρ and the shear scalar σ2 diverge, and the geodesic evolution breaks down. Note that the shear scalar σ2 ∝ a −6, and thus it diverges at the same rate as the massless scalar ﬁeld energy density. In the presence of other matter sources such as dust and radiation, or an inﬂationary potential, since the energy density −6, the shear scalar dominates near the classical singularity diverges slower than a and the singularity is necessarily anisotropic.  Let us now summarize the loop quantization of the Bianchi-I model. It is car- ried out with a similar procedure as in isotropic model, where one starts with a Hamiltonian constraint expressed in terms of triads Ea i and the ﬁeld strength of the holonomies F i ab . The holonomies yield an algebra of almost periodic functions of connections ci, and the ﬁeld strength can be computed by considering holonomies over a square loop  cid:2 ij. Due to the presence of anisotropies, the relation between the edge lengths ¯μi of the loops turns out to be: [26]  .  p1 p2p3 ,  .  p2 p1p3 ,  .  p3 p1p2 ,  ¯μ1 = λ  ¯μ2 = λ  and ¯μ3 = λ   51   which reduces to the isotropic relation  15  when p1 = p2 = p3. Due to the func- tional dependence on direction triads, the action of the elements of the holonomy al- gebra exp i¯μici  is very complicated on the states Ψ p1, p2, p3 . It is more convenient to work with states Ψ l1, l2, v  where li are deﬁned via pi =  sgn li   4πγλl2 Pl 2 3 l2 i , and v = 2 l1l2l3 . Computing the action of the ﬁeld strength and the triad opera- tors on these states, which also required to be symmetric under the change of the orientations of the triad, the quantum Hamiltonian constraint turns out to be  where  ΘB−IΨ l1, l2, v; φ  =   v+2    v+4 Ψ+  φΨ l1, l2, v; φ  = −ΘB−I Ψ l1, l2, v; φ  ∂2   52    cid:2      πG cid:2 2  √ v √ − v−2   8  √   cid:2  4  l1, l2, v − v+2  v−4Ψ − 4  l1, l2, v; φ   vΨ+  0  0  l1, l2, v; φ   .  53   0  l1, l2, v; φ + v−2  −  vΨ  nIf matter has a non-vanishing anisotropic stress, as in the case of magnetic ﬁelds, Σ2 is not constant in the classical theory.

If one starts with an initial wave function which is peaked on a non-zero volume and which vanishes at v = 0, then in the quantum evolution it cannot have support on the zero volume. The classical singularity at v = 0 is decoupled from the evolution in the quantum theory [26]. This shows that for such wave functions, the spacetime curvature will remain bounded throughout the physical evolution. Further, it can be shown that the isotropic LQC for k = 0 model is recovered by integrating out anisotropies. To explore the physics in detail, numerical simulations on the lines of the isotropic models are required to compute expectation values of the Dirac  observables, which in this case are ˆV φ, ˆl1φ and ˆl2φ. Since the form of the quantum  evolution operator  52  is quite complicated in comparison to the isotropic quantum evolution operator  18 , numerical simulations are technically diﬃcult. However, insights have been gained on simplifying the quantum constraint to obtain physical solutions [175].  Useful insights on the Planck scale physics in the Bianchi-I model in LQC has been gained using the eﬀective Hamiltonian constraint, which following the deriva- tion in the isotropic model in LQC, is given by [26, 169]:  H = − C eﬀ  1  sin ¯μ1c1   sin ¯μ2c2   8πGγ2 p1p2p3 1 2  ¯μ1  ¯μ2  p1p2 + cyclic terms  + Hmatt   56  where Hmatt denotes the matter Hamiltonian. The expression for the energy density ≈ 0, can be obtained from the vanishing of the eﬀective Hamiltonian constraint, C eﬀ H and it turns out to be   cid:25    cid:24   1  ρ =  8πGγ2λ2  sin ¯μ1c1  sin ¯μ2c2  + cyclic terms  .  The energy density is bounded and has an absolute maximum ρmax ≈ 0.41ρPl, same  as in the isotropic k = 0 model. Using Hamilton’s equations, one can compute   57    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 210  210  I. Agullo & P. Singh  the mean Hubble rate and the shear scalar which also turn out to be bounded [68, 157]: Hmax = 1  2γλ  and σ2 max = 10.125  3γ2λ2 . Similar bounds have been found in the presence of spatial curvature, in Bianchi-II and Bianchi-IX models [29, 157, 159]. It has been so far diﬃcult to ﬁnd a consistent modiﬁed generalized Friedmann equation in terms of the energy density ρ and anisotropic shear scalar σ2, except when anisotropies are weak [169].o However, using Hamilton’s equations the eﬀective dynamics has been explored in a lot of detail. The eﬀective dynamics of the Bianchi-I model turns out to be non-singular for various types of matter resulting in a bounce of the mean scale factor at the Planck scale. For perfect ﬂuids with a vanishing anisotropic stress and with an arbitrary equation of state greater than −1, the curvature invariants are bounded and all strong curvature singularities are generically resolved [130, 131]. The approach to the bounce can be characterized using Kasner exponents and one ﬁnds that depending on the ratio of the initial anisotropy and energy density, the bounce can be associated to a barrel, cigar, pancake or a point like structure. Interestingly, the structures before and after the bounce can change in general and follow certain selection rules [176]. Depending on the anisotropic parameters, some transitions are also completely forbidden. Note that such Kasner transitions are absent in the Bianchi-I model in GR, and are so far known to arise only in LQC.  To summarize, the Bianchi-I model with a massless scalar ﬁeld can be quan- tized in LQC in a similar way as the isotropic models, and the resulting quantum Hamiltonian constraint turns out to be a non-singular quantum diﬀerence equation. Unlike in the classical theory, the energy density, mean Hubble rate and anisotropies remain bounded throughout the evolution. The physics of the quantum Bianchi-I spacetime is considerably richer than the isotropic model and has provided a robust picture of the Planck scale physics in LQC. There are several interesting avenues to explore, including the way quantum geometry aﬀects Mixmaster behavior which is expected to give important insights on the resolution of singularities in more gen- eral situations. Thanks to the formulation of the BKL conjecture in the connection variables [177], a stage is set to carry out a rigorous comparison between the quan- tum and the classical description of spacetimes in the Bianchi models, and to gain valuable insights on the generic resolution of singularities.  3.3. Gowdy Models and the Hybrid Quantization  So far we have discussed spacetimes with a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. A long standing issue in quantum cosmology is whether the physical implications ob- tained in the mini-superspace setting can be trusted for spacetimes with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. One of the directions which has been explored to go  oOne can rearrange the Hamilton’s equations to obtain an equation for the mean Hubble rate which mimics the classical generalized Friedmann equation exactly by deﬁning a ‘quantum shear’ [178]. However, the limitation with such an approach is that the ‘quantum shear’ does not consistently capture the anisotropic shear in the eﬀective spacetime, and one loses important information about the way anisotropies inﬂuence the Planck scale phenomena in LQC.

The results of singularity resolution obtained in homogeneous models are found to be robust in the Gowdy models for vacuum [34] and also in presence of a massless scalar ﬁeld [33]. In the following, we outline the main features of this approach for the vacuum case.  The Gowdy spacetimes which have been studied so far in LQC are the one with linear polarization. The spatial manifold is T3 coordinatized by  θ, σ, δ . The spacetime has two Killing ﬁelds, ∂σ and ∂δ, which are hypersurface orthogonal. The spatial dependence in the ﬁelds is captured completely by θ. Using the underlying symmetries, a partial gauge ﬁxing can be performed and one is left with two global constraints: the diﬀeomorphism constraint Cθ and the Hamiltonian constraint CH . The metric components are periodic in θ, and using this periodicity, one can per- form a Fourier expansion of the metric ﬁelds and the reduced phase space can be decomposed into homogeneous  Γhom  and inhomogeneous sectors  Γinhom . The ho- mogeneous sector is equivalent to the phase space of the compact vacuum Bianchi-I spacetime. For the inhomogeneous sector one can introduce the creation and anni- ∗ hilation variables, am and a m respectively, using which the global diﬀeomorphism constraint can be written as  Cθ =  ∞ cid:8   n=1  Ho =  nan − a ∗ † −na−n  = 0 . n a  cid:8   1  n a cid:3   nan  8πGγ2  n cid:7 =0  The Hamiltonian for the inhomogeneous modes consists of a free part Ho:   cid:8   n cid:7 =0   cid:24   and an interaction part Hint: 1  Hint =  8πGγ2  1 2n  2a cid:3   nan + ana−n + a cid:3   na cid:3 −n      CH = − 2 γ2V  which mixes diﬀerent inhomogeneous modes. The total Hamiltonian constraint for all the modes is given by   cθpθ cσpσ + cθpθ cδpδ + cσpσ cσpσ   − G  32π2γ2pθHo +   cσpσ + cδpδ 2  pθ  Hint  ,   61    cid:25 0  where the terms in the ﬁrst parenthesis arise from the homogeneous part correspond- ing to the phase space of the Bianchi-I spacetime. This part of the Hamiltonian constraint is loop quantized following the technique elaborated in Section 3.2, but for the earlier quantization [24]. The inhomogeneous part of the constraint, ex- pressed in terms of the annihilation and creation operators, is Fock quantized.

Once we have these quantum constraints, the inner product is obtained by using the same strategy as in the quantization of isotropic and anisotropic spacetimes. A complete set of Dirac observables are found which are self-adjoint with respect to the inner product. A feature of the above quantization, shared with the loop quantization of the Bianchi- I model, is the zero volume states in the homogeneous sector that are decoupled by the action of the Hamiltonian constraint. Thus the states corresponding to the classical singularity at zero volume are absent and in this sense the singularity is resolved.  The physics of the the Planck regime in these spacetimes is being explored using eﬀective dynamics which conﬁrms the existence of the bounce in the presence of in- homogeneities. Earlier work in the eﬀective dynamics of the Gowdy model was based on using the eﬀective Hamiltonian constraint for a slightly diﬀerent quantization of the Bianchi-I spacetime [24], which has some undesirable features [26, 68, 130]. It was found that in the case where the bounce can be approximated by the dynamics of the vacuum Bianchi-I model, the statistical average of the inhomogeneities across the bounce is positive. On the other hand, when dynamics is dominated by inhomo- geneities the statistical average of inhomogeneities across the bounce is preserved. More recently, the eﬀective dynamics has been studied using the eﬀective Hamilto- nian constraint for the improved Bianchi-I quantization [26]. It turns out that in comparison to the homogeneous Bianchi-I spacetime in LQC, the inhomogeneities increase the volume at which the bounce occurs. These investigations provide a ﬁrst glimpse of the bounce in the presence of Fock quantized inhomogeneities in LQC. It serves as a useful intermediate step towards the full loop quantization of Gowdy spacetimes.  4. Inhomogeneous Perturbations in LQC  The standard model of cosmology  see e.g. [180–183]  is based on classical general relativity, and therefore cannot describe the earliest epochs of cosmic expansion, when curvature invariants reach the Planck scale. The goal of this and next section is to use LQC to extend existing models to the Planck era. This extension opens the possibility of connecting Planck scale physics with cosmological observations, providing a new avenue to test some of the fundamental ideas on which the theory   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 213  Loop Quantum Cosmology  213  rests. The extension will also provide new physical mechanisms to account for the intriguing large scale anomalies observed in the CMB.  But to carry out this task, the theoretical framework summarized in previ- ous sections is insuﬃcient. A key ingredient in existing theories of the early uni- verse, such as inﬂation, is the physics of ﬁrst order cosmological perturbations, the so-called scalar and tensor modes, that propagate on a classical Friedmann- Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker  FLRW  spacetime. We can observe features of these perturbations in the cosmic microwave background  CMB , allowing us to confront diﬀerent models with observations. Therefore, if our goal is to incorporate LQC ideas in the description of the early universe, we need ﬁrst to extend our theoretical framework to incorporate inhomogeneous cosmological perturbations propagating on the quantum cosmological spacetime, described in the previous section. Since cosmological observations [39] have conﬁrmed that the early universe is very well described by a homogeneous and isotropic FLRW line element with spatial curva- ture compatible with zero, the rest of this section will focus on quantum spacetimes with these features, that were described in Section 2.  Incorporation of inhomogeneous perturbations on quantum spacetimes poses an interesting challenge. Far from the Planck regime, when the quantum aspects of gravity can be neglected, inhomogeneous ﬁrst order perturbations are accurately described as quantum ﬁelds propagating in a classical expanding universe. The the- ory of quantum ﬁelds in curved spacetimes [184–186], well established since 1970’s, provides the suitable theoretical arena. But in the Planck regime the background geometry is fully quantum. Since quantum states Ψ ν, φ  introduced in previous sections provide only probabilistic amplitudes for the occurrence of various met- rics, a priori we do not have a classical FLRW geometry in the background. How do inhomogeneous perturbations propagate on theses quantum geometries Ψ ν, φ ? This section will show that the answer to this question becomes tractable under the assumption that ﬁrst order perturbations produce negligible back-reaction on the background quantum spacetime on which they propagate, i.e. when they can be considered as test ﬁelds. This assumption plays also a key role in the standard cos- mological model, as well as in alternatives to inﬂation [188, 189]. In LQC, once the test ﬁeld approximation is made, it becomes possible to obtain a well-deﬁned quan- tum ﬁeld theory of cosmological perturbations on quantum FLRW spacetimes [190]. The reader is referred to [42, 190–194] for further details.  See also Refs. [195] for application of similar techniques to spherically symmetric spacetimes.   We begin by brieﬂy summarizing the well-known classical theory of cosmolog- ical, gauge invariant, ﬁrst order perturbations on spatially ﬂat FLRW spacetimes  see e.g. [196] for details . This will establish notation and provide the arena for quantization. Then we construct the quantum theory upon it. Finally, we will use these results to include Planck scale physics in the description of the early uni- verse, and to describe mechanisms to connect Planck scale physics with cosmological observations.

Cosmological Perturbations in Classical FLRW Spacetimes  Most explorations of the early universe rest on the assumption that the energy- momentum budget during the ﬁrst stages of cosmic expansion was dominated by a scalar ﬁeld φ commonly called the inﬂaton, that is subject to an eﬀective potential v φ .  An example was discussed in Section 3.1.3, with v φ  = 1 2 m2φ2.  This scalar ﬁeld can be thought either as a fundamental or an eﬀective degree of freedom. Then, motivated by CMB observations which show that the early universe was extraor- dinarily homogeneous and isotropic, one looks for solutions of Einstein equations given by a FLRW metric gab t  with a homogeneous and isotropic scalar ﬁeld φ t  as source, together with inhomogeneous ﬁrst order perturbations δgab  cid:2 x, t , δφ  cid:2 x, t . The gravitational ﬁeld by itself contains two physical degrees of freedom — so most of the metric components are purely coordinate  gauge  dependent functions — and adding the scalar ﬁeld our system has three physical degrees of freedom in total. In order to avoid gauge artifacts, it is convenient to re-write the perturbation ﬁelds δgab  cid:2 x, t , δφ  cid:2 x, t  in terms of these gauge invariant degrees of freedoms: they are made of the so-called scalar perturbation Q x  — known as the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable — and two tensor perturbations T  1  x  and T  2  x . Physically one can think of Q as representing perturbations of the scalar ﬁeld, and tensor modes as representing the two polarizations of a gravity wave. These variables, together with their conjugate momenta and the homogeneous and isotropic degrees of freedom,  span the physical phase space Γphys = Γhom × Γpert, where Γhom is made of two pairs of canonically conjugate variables  a, π a ; φ, p φ  , with a the standard scale factor of the FLRW metric and Γpert is the phase space of scalar and tensor modes. Since the two tensor modes behave identically, from now on we will denote them collectively by T .  We now discuss dynamics in Γphys. First, if we restrict to the homogeneous sector, Γhom, dynamical trajectories are generated by the restriction to FLRW of the Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity  see Section 2   +  ,  CH [N ] = N  − 3V0 8πG  p2  a  a  +  1 2  p2  φ  a3V0  + a3V0 v φ   ,   63   where κ = 8πG. The lapse function N indicates the time coordinate one is using: N = 1 corresponds to standard cosmic or proper time t, N = a to conformal time η, and N = V 3 0 a3 p φ  := Nφ to choosing the scalar ﬁeld φ as a time variable, which turns out to be the most appropriate choice in the LQC.p The evolution generated by CH [N ] takes place entirely in Γhom; it does not involve inhomogeneous Dynamics in Γpert is generated by a true Hamiltonian C2, which is obtained from  perturbations.  the second order piece of the scalar constraint of general relativity by keeping only terms which are quadratic in ﬁrst order perturbations.

Therefore, tensor modes satisfy the same equation as a massless scalar ﬁeld in FLRW, and similarly for scalar perturbations, except for the presence of the external potential U . As expected, the dynamics in Γpert knows about Γhom: scalar and tensor perturbations satisfy linear diﬀerential equations  66  which contain coeﬃcients involving background variables. Dynamics then is obtained by ﬁrst solving the evolution for a η  and φ η  using only  CH, and then ‘lifting’ the resulting dynamical trajectory to Γpert using  66 . This is a  consequence of the main approximation underlying this construction: perturbations produce negligible back-reaction on the background metric. In the inﬂationary scenario, the next step is to quantize the perturbation ﬁelds Q and T , but keeping the homogeneous degrees of freedom as classical. This is justiﬁed because curvature invariants are well below the Planck scale at all times during and after inﬂation, and hence quantum eﬀects of the gravitational back- ground are expected to be negligible. Therefore, one keeps the homogeneous phase space Γhom unmodiﬁed, but replaces the classical phase space of perturbations Γpert by a Hilbert space Hpert in which the perturbation ﬁelds ˆQ and ˆT are represented as  quantum operators. This is a quantum ﬁeld theory in a classical FLRW spacetime, and therefore well established techniques [180–183] are available to extract physical predictions from this system.  As in the classical theory, this semiclassical framework rests on the test ﬁeld ap- proximation. A necessary condition for its validity is that the stress-energy of per- turbations must be subdominant compared to the background contribution. Since energy and momentum are quadratic in the basic variables, one needs to introduce renormalization techniques to obtain well-deﬁned expressions. The ambiguities in the process of renormalization in curved spacetimes add diﬃculties in testing the validity of this semiclassical theory.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 216  216  I. Agullo & P. Singh  In the next subsection we describe the framework in which both the homogeneous as well as the inhomogeneous degrees of freedom are treated quantum-mechanically.  4.2. Quantum Theory of Cosmological Perturbations on a Quantum  FLRW  The description of perturbations in a quantum cosmological background is more complicated than that in the classical FLRW case, although it will follow the same logical steps. In particular, the construction relies upon the assumption that per- turbations produce negligible eﬀects on the background. In the classical theory, the absence of back-reaction is reﬂected on the fact that dynamics of background ﬁelds a η  and φ η  is completely independent of perturbations. In the quantum theory, the test ﬁeld approximation is incorporated by assuming that the total wave function Ψ has the form of a product  Ψ a, φ,Q cid:7 k,T cid:7 k  = Ψhom a, φ  ⊗ Ψpert a, φ,Q cid:7 k,T cid:7 k  .   68   This structure implies the absence of correlations between background and inho- mogeneous degrees of freedom initially, which is then maintained during evolution as long as the test ﬁeld approximation holds. Our task now is, ﬁrst, to construct the quantum theory describing Ψhom, and then study the evolution of Ψpert on the background geometry Ψhom.  The evolution of Ψhom follows exactly the steps described in Section 2 except that, as noted in Section 3.1.3, in presence of an inﬂationary potential v φ , the Θ appearing in the evolution equation  19  now must be replaced by operator  √   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27 Θ − v φ  ν2 πGγ2   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27 1 2  2  . The presence of v φ  poses new challenges, because the  2  resulting operator fails to be essentially self-adjoint for a generic potential v φ . However, as we will see in the next subsection, we will be only interested in situa- tion in which  cid:8 Θ cid:9   cid:28   cid:8 v φ  ν2 πGγ2  cid:9  in the Planck era. Under these circumstances, the potential can be treated as a perturbation to Θ, and one can show it produces a negligible contribution to the evolution in the quantum gravity regime. More pre- cisely, as discussed in [197], in situations of physical interest  see next subsection , the evolution with and without potential produce results for observable quantities with diﬀerences several orders of magnitude smaller than observational error bars. One can therefore obtain reliable predictions without including the potential in the quantum gravity regime. Then, we can directly import the result of Section 2 for the evolution of Ψhom. Nevertheless the mathematical subtleties appearing in the inclusion of the inﬂaton potential constitute an important open issue, although not of direct relevance for the phenomenological considerations. These issues have been studied for a constant potential, i.e. a cosmological constant Λ, in [21] where it   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27 Θ − Λ ν2 πGγ2   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27 1 2  was found that, although the operator fails to be essentially self-adjoint, the quantum evolution is surprisingly insensitive to the choice of the self-adjoint extension.  2   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 217  Loop Quantum Cosmology  217  The next task is to construct the theory of perturbations Ψpert propagating on the quantum spacetime Ψhom. Dynamics in this theory is extracted from the constraint equation  19  in the presence of perturbations. For brieﬂy, we will write down some of the intermediate steps of the quantization for tensor modes, and simply provide the result for scalar perturbations at the end.  Evolution for the entire system will be obtained from the constraint equation   19 , that now reads  −i cid:2  ∂φ Ψhom ⊗ Ψpert  =   Ψhom ⊗ Ψpert    69    cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  cid:2 2Θ − 2V0 C T     cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  1  2  2  The test ﬁeld approximation allows us to use perturbation theory to solve this equation. We will treat Θ as the Hamiltonian of the ‘heavy’ degree of freedom and C T   as the Hamiltonian of the light one. Then, the previous equation can be approximated by  see [190] for details   2   −i cid:2  ∂φΨhom  ⊗ Ψpert + Ψhom ⊗  −i cid:2  ∂φΨpert   √  =  cid:2   ΘΨhom ⊗ Ψpert − C T    [Nφ] Ψhom ⊗ Ψpert   2   70   2  where we have used that, while the Θ operator acts on Ψhom but not on Ψpert, C T   [Nφ] in contrast acts on both states, since it contains background as well as perturbation operators. The ﬁrst term in each side of the previous equality cancel out by virtue of the evolution of the background state  19 , and we are left with  Ψhom ⊗  i cid:2  ∂φΨpert  = C T    [Nφ] Ψhom ⊗ Ψpert   2  This equation tells us that in the test ﬁeld approximation the right-hand side is proportional to Ψhom, and we therefore can take the inner product of this equation with Ψhom without losing information. The last equation then reduces to  i cid:2  ∂φΨpert =  cid:8 C T    [Nφ] cid:9  Ψpert ,  2  where the expectation value is taken in the physical Hilbert space of the homo- geneous sector. In other words, as long as the test ﬁeld approximation holds, the evolution of perturbation is obtained from C T   [Nφ] where the background operators are replaced by their expectation value in the state Ψhom.  2  This theory is conceptually diﬀerent from quantum ﬁeld theory  QFT  in classi- cal spacetimes. As previously mentioned, the spacetime geometry is not described by a classical metric, but it is rather characterized by a wave function Ψhom that contains the quantum ﬂuctuations of the geometry. Equation  72  tell us that, in- deed, the propagation of perturbations is sensitive to those ﬂuctuations, and not only to the mean-value trajectory of the scale factor  cid:8 ˆa cid:9 .  An interesting aspect of the previous evolution equation  72  is that, by simple  manipulation, it can be written as   71    72    73   ˆT  cid:3  cid:3   cid:7 k  + 2  ˆT  cid:3   cid:7 k  + k2 ˆT cid:7 k = 0 ,   cid:3   ˜a ˜a   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 218  218  I.

The following remarks are in order:  i  No further assumptions beyond the test ﬁeld approximation have been made to obtain this result. In particular, the state Ψhom is not assumed to have small quantum dispersion in the conﬁguration or momentum variables [197].   ii  The metric ˜gab does not satisfy Einstein’s equations. This is obvious from its deﬁnition: its coeﬃcients are obtained as expectation values of background op- erators in the homogeneous and isotropic quantum geometry Ψhom, and therefore they depend on  cid:2 . Rather, ˜gab is a mathematical object that neatly captures the information in Ψhom that is relevant for the propagation of tensor and scalar modes. It is remarkable that, from the rich information contained in Ψhom, test ﬁelds only ‘feel’ a few of its moments, namely  74  75  78 , and furthermore, that these mo- ments can be codiﬁed in a smooth metric ˜gab! This metric is called in the literature the eﬀective dressed metric. [190]. Eﬀective because it contains all the information in Ψhom that is relevant for perturbations; and dressed because it depends not only on the mean value of Ψhom but also on some of its quantum ﬂuctuations.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 219  Loop Quantum Cosmology  219   iii  One should not think about ˜gab as approximating the physical background geometry in any way. The spacetime geometry Ψhom is quantum, and in general cannot be approximated in any reasonable sense by a smooth metric tensor. Rather, ˜gab encodes only the information in Ψhom that test ﬁelds care about. In other words, if we probe the quantum geometry Ψhom using only tensor and scalar modes, we will be unable to distinguish it from a smooth geometry characterized by ˜gab. But if other observables are used, e.g. powers of curvature invariants, we would easily realize that the background gravitational ﬁeld has additional information not captured by ˜gab.   iv  If the state Ψhom is chosen to have very small quantum dispersion in the volume ν  equivalently in the scale factor a , then the dressed metric ˜gab is indis- tinguishable from the eﬀective metric discussed in Section 2.1.3.  Now, because the theory of tensor and scalar test ﬁelds propagating in Ψhom has been written as a QFT in curved spacetime ˜gab, we can import the well-known theo- retical machinery developed in that context and construct a Fock-type quantization of the test ﬁelds. Then, we end up with a hybrid quantization approach, following the ideas introduced in Ref. [31] to study Gowdy models, in which homogeneous degrees of freedom are quantized using LQG techniques and inhomogeneous ﬁelds using standard Fock techniques. This strategy is mathematically consistent and physically attractive, and it allows to make contact with the treatment of test ﬁelds in standard cosmology, e.g. in the inﬂationary scenario.  As in the semi-classical theory, testing the validity of the test ﬁeld approximation is not a simple task. In Refs. [42, 43], this has been done following the same steps as in the semi-classical theory, namely by comparing the expectation value of the renormalized energy and pressure of perturbations with the background contribu- tions. The test ﬁeld approximation may be a real limitation in situations of physical interest, and current eﬀorts are focused on extending the range of applicability of framework summarized above [187].  4.3. Other Approaches  The LQC literature is vast, and other approaches to the quantization of ﬁrst order perturbations exist  see [4, 6, 8, 71, 75, 84–87, 198] . The ‘hybrid quantization ap- proach’ [71–73, 84, 199–201], originally suggested in Ref. [31] for Gowdy cosmologies, has similarities with the ‘dressed metric approach’ presented above, particularly the fact that test ﬁelds are quantized using standard Fock techniques, while the back- ground FLRW geometry follows the non-perturbative methods of loop quantum gravity. The two methods however diﬀer in the way in which constraints for pertur- bations are imposed, already at the classical level. But these conceptual diﬀerence have little impact in observable quantities, at least in the set of solutions that have been explored so far. Hence, the predictions for the primordial spectrum of per- turbations are very similar in both approaches, adding robustness to the program. We focus on the ‘dressed metric approach’ on this chapter primarily because so far   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 220  220  I. Agullo & P. Singh  the most detailed calculations leading to phenomenological predictions have been carried out in this framework.  The ‘separate universe’ approach in LQC [75, 198] has the conceptual advantage of quantizing the homogeneous and inhomogeneous degrees of freedom ‘in tandem’, using only loop techniques, at the expenses of being only applicable to very long wavelengths.  The ‘anomaly-free quantization approach’ summarized in Refs. [6, 86, 87, 202] uses the algebra of gravitational constraints as guiding principle, and develops an eﬀective approach in which quantum gravity corrections are incorporated. The expressions of these quantum corrections are guided by imposing that the constraint algebra closes at the desired order in perturbations. This program produces a physical picture of the very early universe which is very diﬀerent from those in other LQC approaches. Its phenomenological consequences have been explored in [203–205], where it is claimed that some of the predictions are in sharp disagreement with CMB observations.  For further discussion, see Chapter 8.   5. Application: LQC Extension of the Inﬂationary Scenario  Now that we have a quantization for FLRW spacetimes and a theory of scalar and tensor perturbations propagating thereon, we are ready to apply this theoretical framework to the early universe. Among the existing models, the inﬂationary sce- nario is perhaps the most accepted one, and this section summarizes an approach to extend it to the quantum gravity regime [41, 43]. See [206–208] for interesting work in LQC in the context of the “matter bounce scenario”.  5.1. The Strategy  In the inﬂationary scenario one starts by assuming that tensor and scalar modes are in the Bunch–Davies vacuum at some early time when inﬂation begins. This state is then evolved until the end of inﬂation and relevant quantities for observations, e.g. the power spectra of tensor and scalar perturbations, are computed. The choice of the vacuum, however, rests on the implicit assumption that the evolution of the universe before inﬂation is unimportant in what the tensor and scalar modes respect; otherwise tensor and scalar modes would reach the onset of inﬂation in an excited state relative to the inﬂationary vacuum. But to show whether this is a reasonable assumption one needs a model for the pre-inﬂationary universe. Our strategy is to use LQC for this purpose, and compute, rather than postulate, the state of inhomogeneous perturbations at the onset of the slow-roll phase. In the resulting picture the universe contracts for an inﬁnite amount of time, bounces at the Planck scale, and then inﬂation starts at some time after the bounce.q The strategy will −35s after the bounce, and lasts for a similar qIn concrete simulations inﬂation starts around 10 interval of time. However, the universe only expands for around ﬁfteen e-folds from the bounce to the onset of inﬂation, while it expands for more than 60 e-folds during inﬂation. On the contrary,   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 221  Loop Quantum Cosmology  221  then be to start with vacuum initial conditions for tensor and scalar modes at early times, possibly prior to the bounce, evolve them using the LQC equations, and show that the resulting state at the onset of inﬂation coincides with the Bunch- Davies vacuum to a good approximation. If the initial state can be speciﬁed in a compelling fashion and if it does not evolve to a state that is suﬃciently close to the Bunch-Davies vacuum at the onset of inﬂation, the viability of the framework would be jeopardized. If, on the other hand, the evolved state turns out to be close to the Bunch-Davies vacuum but with appreciable deviations, there would be new observable eﬀects.  Therefore, the eﬀect of LQC in observable quantities that we are looking for does not come from quantum gravity corrections generated during inﬂation. There, the energy density and curvature of the universe are around eleven orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, and quantum gravity corrections are suppressed by a similar factor. On the contrary, the eﬀects we are looking for are generated before inﬂation, when quantum gravity eﬀects dominate. The important fact is that scalar and tensor perturbations keep memory of these eﬀects [209, 210] which then can be imprinted in the CMB temperature anisotropies — if the amount of inﬂationary expansion is not much larger than 70 e-folds for these corrections not to be red- shifted to super-horizon scales.  The exploration of phenomenological consequences in LQC follows these steps:  i  Choose an inﬂationary potential v φ .  ii  Specify the quantum state for the FLRW geometry Ψhom ν, φ .  iii  Specify the quantum state for tensor and scalar modes Ψpert.  iv  Evolve the background and perturbations using the theoretical framework  spelled out in previous sections.   v  Compute observable quantities.  We now discuss these steps in more detail:   i  Choose an inﬂationary potential v φ . Although it would be desirable to derive the potential from ﬁrst principles, at the present time there is no compelling candidate within LQC. One could expect though that v φ  originates from a theory of particle physics, rather than from LQC which is a purely gravitational theory — although there also exist the exciting possibility that the inﬂaton ﬁeld and its potential have a purely gravitational origin [211, 212]. Therefore, the strategy so far in LQC is the same as in standard inﬂation, namely to use diﬀerent phenomenologi- cally viable potentials and contrast the results with observations. Two choices have been explored in great detail in LQC: the quadraticr and the so-called Starobinsky  while the spacetime scalar curvature during inﬂation is almost constant, it decreases about eleven orders of magnitude from the bounce to the onset of slow-roll. These numbers are obtained using initial conditions that lead to interesting observable eﬀects in the CMB, and they can vary for other choices. rUpper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio recently obtained from the Planck satellite observa- tions [39] slightly disfavor the quadratic potential. However, LQC corrections can alleviate these constraints [215], and therefore this potential may still be of some interest.

Singh  potential [213, 214]:  1 2   cid:2    1 − exp −  3m2 32π  v φ  =  m2φ2  and v φ  =  16πG 3 φ  2   79   The free parameter m can be ﬁxed by CMB observations although, as analyzed in detail in [215], in LQC there is some extra freedom. It is also important to keep in mind that LQC eﬀects have a purely quantum gravity origin and are largely inde- pendent of the choice of potential. Therefore, predictions obtained from diﬀerent choices of v φ  are all quite similar.   ii  Quantum state for the FLRW geometry Ψhom ν, φ . As discussed at the beginning of Section 4.2, the states Ψhom of interest diﬀer from the ones described in Section 2 in that now the dynamics contains an inﬂationary potential v φ . But detailed analysis [43, 214, 215] have showed that LQC eﬀects can be imprinted in the CMB only if the contribution from the potential v φ  is subdominant around the bounce time, as compared to the kinetic energy of φ. This is because potential dominated bounces lead to very long inﬂationary phases, and LQC eﬀects will then be red-shifted to super-Hubble scales. But even if the potential is subdominant around the bounce time, it gains relevance later in the evolution, and eventually dominates during inﬂation. However, it turns out that the potential dominated regime occurs well after the quantum gravity era, at a time when the energy density and curvature invariants are all well below the Planck scale, and general relativity becomes an excellent approximation. Therefore, the regime of physical interest for investigations of LQC phenomenology is such that the potential v φ  can be treated as a perturbation during the quantum gravity era. Furthermore, as shown in Ref. [197], the relative eﬀect of the potential in observable quantities under these circumstances is several orders of magnitude below observational sensitivity. Therefore, one can choose to simply ignore the potential in the quantum gravity era without aﬀecting the accuracy of observational predictions. In this situation one is led to work with the states described in Section 2.  Among all the states for the homogeneous and isotropic gravitational ﬁeld de- scribed in Section 2, the simplest choice is to work with states Ψhom ν, φ  that have very small quantum dispersions in volume ν around the bounce time. These states remain ‘sharply peaked’ during the entire evolution. More importantly, the resulting geometry can be accurately described by the eﬀective metric presented in Section 2.1.3. For these states the energy density at the time of the bounce satu- rates the supremum in the entire physical Hilbert space, ρmax. The only freedom in Ψhom ν, φ  is then the way this energy density is divided between potential and ki- netic energy of the inﬂation ﬁeld at the bounce. Diﬀerent choices produce solutions that accumulate diﬀerent amounts of expansion between the bounce and the end of inﬂation, NB := ln ; therefore, the freedom can be parameterized by the value of NB.  aend abounce   cid:3    cid:4    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 223  Loop Quantum Cosmology  223  One can also choose states Ψhom ν, φ  which have large dispersion in ν, and therefore are not sharply peaked in any of the variables. The computation of the scalar power spectrum is numerically more challenging in this case, and has been recently performed in [197] for states containing relative quantum dispersion in ν as large as 168% in the Planck epoch. The main lessons from this analysis are:  i  observational quantities are sensitive to the quantum dispersion in Ψhom ν, φ ;  ii  however, the eﬀects are quite simple and, within observational error bars, pre- dicted observable quantities cannot distinguish between a widely spread state which produces a certain amount of expansion NB, and a sharply peaked state with a slightly diﬀerent valued of NB  see [197] for details . Therefore, if one is only in- terested in observational predictions, there is no loss of generality in restricting to sharply peaked states, as long as diﬀerent values of NB are considered. This will be the strategy that we will follow in the rest of this section.   iii  Quantum state for tensor and scalar modes. The speciﬁcation of the initial state for inhomogeneous perturbations is an important question. Two main strate- gies have been followed in the LQC-literature: the state is speciﬁed by choosing vacuum initial conditions at [41, 43, 201, 215] or before the bounce [203, 204, 215]. It could seem at ﬁrst that the far past is the natural place to set up initial data for perturbations. One cannot disregard, however, the possibility that quantum grav- ity eﬀects make the pre-bounce evolution unimportant. Note that in the presence of an inﬂationary phase the radius of the observable universe is of the order of 10 Planck lengths at the time of the bounce. At these scales quantum gravity eﬀects are very eﬃcient, and there are indication that they could produce a diluting eﬀect that makes scalar and tensor modes to forget about features acquired in the con- tracting phase. This is an interesting possibility, and in the absence of conclusive arguments the best strategy is to keep working with the two options and contrast their predictions with observations.  But even after making a choice between these two possibilities, one still has to face the inherent ambiguity in the deﬁnition of vacuum in quantum ﬁeld theory in an expanding universe. If all wavelengths of interest are much smaller that the curvature radius, the adiabatic approach provides a useful criteria to reduce the ambiguity; if we are not in this situation, other arguments are needed. Diﬀerent proposals for initial vacuum have been used in LQC. In [216], in a more general context, a covariant criterion was introduced to specify the notion of vacuum at a given time, by demanding that the expectation value of the adiabatically renormal- ized energy-momentum tensor vanishes at that time. In many situations of practical interest this condition provides a unique state. Reference [201], on the other hand, has ﬁxed the freedom in the vacuum by demanding that certain time variations of the mode functions characterizing the quantum state in Fourier space are minimized during the evolution. Finally, in Refs. [217, 218] a quantum generalization of the Penrose’s Weyl curvature hypothesis has been used to single out a vacuum state   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 224  224  I. Agullo & P. Singh  using considerations that bridge the Planck regime around the bounce and the end of inﬂation.   iv  Evolution of the background and perturbations can be obtained by using  the theoretical framework spelled out in previous sections.   v  Computation of observable quantities. The quantities of interest are the power spectrum of tensor and scalar perturbations, and their spectral indices, which are deﬁned in the standard way  see e.g. [183] .  5.2. Results  Chapter 8 in this volume focuses on the phenomenology of loop quantum gravity. In particular, Section 3 in that chapter is devoted to LQC, and includes results for CMB anisotropies obtained from the theoretical framework we have described in this chapter. Therefore, this section will be brief and its aim is to complement the analysis in the mentioned chapter.  Figure 2, extracted from Ref. [215], shows the scalar and tensor power spectrum for a given choice of parameters and initial state. The detailed analysis of these results was presented in [41, 43], and further analyzed in [215]. The main new feature in the power spectra is the appearance of a new scale, kLQC, which is directly related to the value of the spacetime scalar curvature at the time of the bounce, kLQC a tB  := R tB  6. LQC corrections appear for Fourier modes with k  cid:3  kLQC. Modes with larger k are essentially insensitive to the bounce; they reach the onset of inﬂation in the Bunch-Davies vacuum and, as a consequence, their power spectrum is almost scale invariant.   cid:2   The observable eﬀects of LQC in the CMB therefore depend on the value that the new scale, which is of the order of the Planck scale at the time of bounce, has at the present time t0, i.e. the value of kLQC a t0 , which in turn is dictated by the number of e-folds from the bounce to the end of inﬂation NB  the expansion accumulated from the end of inﬂation until the present time is ﬁxed by the stan- −1, dard model of cosmology . If kLQC a t0  is larger than k∗ a t0  := 0.002 Mpc the observed power spectrum is predicted to deviate signiﬁcantly from scale invari- ance. Available data from the CMB temperature anisotropies constrain kLQC  a t0  to be of the same order or smaller than k∗ a t0 , so kLQC is constrained to be smaller than k∗. On the other hand, if kLQC  a t0  is smaller than approximately 0.1 k∗ a t0  , then LQC corrections are swept to length scales larger than our ob- servable universe. Therefore, if LQC correction were to appear in CMB, we must have kLQC ∈ [0.1k∗, k∗]. This is equivalent of saying that the amount of expan-  sion from the bounce to the present time is such that a wavelength of size twice the Planck length at the bounce is red-shifted to approximately 3000Mpc at the present time. Although there are no mechanisms based on precise arguments to explain why such coincidence should happen, Ref. [217] has provided concrete physical principles that lead to this situation. Furthermore, observations have detected deviations from   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 225  Loop Quantum Cosmology  225  Fig. 2.

Although the associated statistical signiﬁcance of these anomalies is inconclusive, it is quite tempting to think that they may be visible traces of new physics, as indeed emphasized in [219].   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 226  226  I. Agullo & P. Singh  A natural question is then whether the LQC bounce preceding inﬂation provides a suitable mechanism to quantitatively account for the observed anomalies. The Planck team has paid particular attention to two anomalous features in the CMB [219], namely:  i  a dipolar asymmetry arising from the fact that the averaged power spectrum is larger in a given hemisphere of the CMB than in the other, and;  ii  a power suppression at large scale, corresponding to a deﬁcit of correlations at angular multipoles  cid:9   cid:3  20 as compared to the predictions of a scale invariant spectrum. We now brieﬂy summarize existing ideas related to these anomalies in LQC.  A primordial dipolar asymmetry requires correlations between diﬀerent wave- numbers k in the power spectrum. Such correlations do not arise at leading order in models for which the background is homogeneous, as the scenario discussed in the last two sections: the two-point function in Fourier space is diagonal. This moti- vated the authors of Ref [220] to go beyond leading order and discuss the corrections the primordial spectrum acquires from the three-point function  i.e. corrections from non-Gaussianitiy . As ﬁrst pointed out in [221], non-Gaussian eﬀects in the two- point function could indeed be responsible for the observed dipolar modulation in the CMB. In Ref. [220] this idea was implemented in LQC. The non-Gaussianity that inﬂation generates as a consequence of the pre-inﬂationary LQC bounce were computed and its eﬀect on the primordial power spectrum were obtained. The re- sult is that there exist values of the free parameters — the value of the inﬂaton ﬁeld at the bounce φB  or equivalently, NB  and its mass m — that make the non- Gaussian modulation of the power spectrum to induce a scale dependent dipolar modulation in the CMB that agrees with the observed anomaly. Furthermore, this mechanism also oﬀers the possibility to account for the power suppression, since a monopolar modulation appears, in addition to the dipole, at large angular scales, which could reverse the enhancement of power shown in Figure 2. The analysis in [220] included the non-Gaussianity generated during inﬂation, but a contribu- tion to the three-point function from the bounce is also expected. However, this contribution to non-Gaussianity is signiﬁcantly more challenging to compute, even numerically, because of the absence of the slow-roll approximation normally used to simplify the computations in inﬂation. Work is in progress [222] to complete this computation with the goal of establishing that the non-Gaussian modulation in LQC is a viable mechanism to simultaneously account for the two observed anomalies.  Other ideas have also recently appeared to account for the power suppression at large scales [201, 217]. They are related to the choice of initial state for scalar per- turbation at the time of the bounce mentioned above in this section. The statement in these works is that one can ﬁnd physical criteria to select a preferred notion of ground state at the bounce which, when evolved until the end of inﬂation, produce a power spectrum which is suppressed compared to the standard scale invariant result for low values of k.

Discussion  LQC provides a remarkable example of successful quantization of the sector of clas- sical GR spacetimes with symmetries observed at cosmological scales. It is based on a precise mathematical framework, supplemented with sophisticated state of the art numerical techniques. One starts by showing that the requirement of background independence is strong enough to uniquely ﬁx the quantum representation, just as the Poincar´e symmetry ﬁxes the representation of the observable algebra in the standard quantum theory of free ﬁelds. One then uses this preferred representation. This procedure was ﬁrst applied to a spatially ﬂat FLRW background and the re- sulting quantum geometry was analyzed in detail. As described in this chapter, the ﬁnal picture realizes many of the intuition that physicists, starting from Wheeler, have had about non-perturbative quantum gravity. Furthermore, interesting ques- tions can now be answered in a precise fashion in LQC. Of particular interest is the way in which quantum eﬀects are able to overwhelm the gravitational attraction and resolve the big bang singularity. While the LQC non-perturbative corrections dom- inate the evolution in the Planck regime and remove the big bang singularity, they disappear at low energies restoring agreement with the classical description. This is a non trivial result. The analysis has been extended to more complicated models containing spacial curvature, anisotropies, and even models with inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom such as the Gowdy spacetime, adding signiﬁcant robustness to the emergent physical picture. Using eﬀective spacetime description of LQC, the problem of singularities in general has been addressed, which provides important insights on the generic resolution of strong curvature singularities.  One can further extend the regime of applicability of LQC by including cos- In standard cosmology one describes scalar and tensor mological perturbations. curvature perturbations by quantum ﬁelds propagating in a classical FLRW space- time. This is the theoretical framework — QFT in classical spacetimes — on which the phenomenological explorations of the early universe rely, e.g. in the inﬂationary scenario. In this chapter we have reviewed how such a framework can be generalized by replacing the classical spacetime by the quantum geometry provided by LQC. This framework provides a rich environment to analyze many interesting questions both conceptually and at the phenomenological level. It oﬀers the theoretical arena to explore the evolution of scalar and tensor perturbations in the early universe, and to provide a self-consistent quantum gravity completion of the standard cosmologi- cal scenarios. It is our view that the level of detail and mathematical rigor attained in LQC is uncommon in quantum cosmology. The new framework has become a fertile arena to obtain new mechanisms that could explain some of the anoma- lous features observed in the CMB, which indicate that physics beyond inﬂation is required to understand the large scale correlations in the CMB [219].  Since LQC is a quantization of classical spacetimes with symmetries that are appropriate to cosmology, the theoretical framework shares the limitations of the symmetry reduced quantization strategy. Symmetry reduction often entails a   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 228  228  I. Agullo & P. Singh  drastic simpliﬁcation, and therefore one may lose important features of the theory by restricting the symmetry prior to quantization. This is an important issue which has attracted eﬀorts from diﬀerent fronts. First let us recall that the BKL conjec- ture further supports the idea that quantum cosmological models are very useful in capturing the dynamics of spacetime near the singularities. Within LQC itself, the concern was initially alleviated by checking that models with larger complexity, such as anisotropic Bianchi I model, correctly reproduced the FLRW quantization previously obtained, when the anisotropies are ‘frozen’ at the quantum level. This test is even more remarkable when applied to models that have inﬁnitely many de- grees of freedom to begin with, as it is the case of the Gowdy model. More generally, there are interesting recent results on establishing a connection between LQC and LQG [224–226]. These include quantum-reduced loop quantum gravity [227], where the main idea is to capture symmetry reduction at the quantum level in LQG and then pass to the cosmological sector, and group ﬁeld theory cosmology [89]. Promising results have been obtained in these approaches. As examples, improved dynamics as the one used in isotropic LQC has been found in quantum-reduced loop quantum gravity [228], and evidence of LQC like evolution and bounce have been reported in group ﬁeld theory cosmology [229]. It is rather encouraging that results from diﬀerent directions seem to yield a consistent picture of the Planck scale physics as has been extensively found in LQC  Another important ingredient in LQC is the process of de-parameterization. In the absence of a fundamental time variable in quantum gravity, in LQC one follows a relational-time approach in which one of the dynamical variables plays the role of time, and one studies the evolution of other degrees of freedom with respect to it. As explained in Section 2, in most of the LQC literature one uses a massless scalar ﬁeld as time variable. An important question is how the physical results depend on the variable chosen as a time, i.e. if quantum theories constructed from diﬀerent relational times are unitarily related. This is an age old question in quantum cosmology, but so far has not been systematically addressed.  It is worth commenting on some of the directions where signiﬁcant progress has been made in LQC, in contrast to the earlier works in quantum cosmology. The ﬁrst one deals with a rigorous treatment of fundamental questions in quantum cos- mology about the probability of events — such as the probability for encountering a singularity or a bounce. These are hard questions whose answers had been elu- sive due to the lack of suﬃcient control over the physical Hilbert space structure, including properties of observables and a notion of time to deﬁne histories. Thanks to the quantization of isotropic and homogeneous spacetimes using a scalar ﬁeld φ as a clock, a consistent history formulation can be completed both in the Wheeler- DeWitt theory and LQC [49–52]. A covariant generalization of these results has also been pursued [53]. Using exactly soluble model of sLQC computation of class operators, decoherence functional and probability amplitudes can be performed. It turns out that in the Wheeler-DeWitt theory the probability for bounce turns out   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 229  Loop Quantum Cosmology  229  to be zero even if one considers an arbitrary superposition of expanding and con- tracting states. The probability of bounce turns out to be unity in LQC. These developments show that not only LQC has been successful in overcoming problem of singularities which plague Wheeler-DeWitt theory, it has also established an an- alytical structure which has been used to answer foundational questions both in LQC and the Wheeler-DeWitt theory.  The second direction where developments in LQC are expected to have an im- pact beyond LQG are in the development of sophisticated numerical algorithms to understand the evolution in deep Planck regime for a wide variety of initial states, including with very large spreads [66, 107, 108]. Some of these techniques have been exported from traditional numerical relativity ideas which are modiﬁed and applied in the quantum geometric setting. Using high performance computing, these meth- ods promise to yield a detailed picture of the physics of the Planck scale. These techniques can be replicated in a straightforward way for other quantum gravity ap- proaches. More importantly they provide a platform to understand the structure of quantum spacetime analogous to the numerical works in classical gravity [36, 37]. A deeper understanding of how quantum gravitational eﬀects modify the BKL conjec- ture and change our understanding of approach to singularity in the classical theory is a promising arena. Interesting results in this direction have started appearing, including on singularity resolution in Bianchi models [25, 230] and quantum Kas- ner transitions across bounces and selection rules on possible structures near the classical singularities [176].  Finally, we note that sometimes the limitations of LQC have been used to shed doubts on its results. These arguments, mainly articulated by the authors of [202], claim that a fully covariant approach with validity beyond symmetry reduced sce- narios produces physical results inequivalent to those obtained from LQC. In par- ticular, it is argued that, in the presence of inhomogeneities, there is an unavoidable change of signature, from Lorentzian to Euclidean, in an eﬀective theory. The au- thors of this chapter disagree with the conclusions reached in [202] and subsequent papers along these lines. In our view, although the conceptual points raised by those authors are indeed interesting, their analysis relies on a series of assumptions and approximations that make their results far from being conclusive. Furthermore, recent results on limitations of the eﬀective theories show that care must be taken in generalizing certain conclusions from the eﬀective description to the full quantum theory [107, 108].

Discussion of the Conceptual Issues  Black holes are remarkable solutions of classical general relativity describing impor- tant aspects of the physics of gravitational collapse. Their existence in our nearby universe is supported by a great amount of observational evidence [103]. When iso- lated, these systems are expected to be simple for late and distant observers. Once the initial very dynamical phase of collapse has passed, the system should settle down to a stationary situation completely described by the Kerr-Newman solutiona labelled by three macroscopic parameters: the mass M , the angular momentum J, and the electromagnetic charge Q.  The fact that the ﬁnal state of gravitational collapse is described by only three macroscopic parameters, independently of the details of the initial conditions lead- ing to the collapse, could be taken as a ﬁrst indication of the thermodynamical nature of black holes  which as we will see below is really of quantum origin . In fact the statement in the ﬁrst paragraph contains the usual coarse graining perspec- tive of thermodynamical physics in the assertion that for suﬃciently long times after collapse the system should settle down to a stationary situation... described by three parameters. The details about how this settling down takes place depend indeed on the initial conditions leading to the collapse  the microstates of the system . The coarse graining consists of neglecting these details in favor of the idealization of stationarity. ∗  Grupo de Teorias de Campos y Fisica Estadistica, Instituto Universitario Gregorio Mill´an Bar-  bany, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Unidad Asociada al IEM-CSIC. †  Unit´e Mixte de Recherche  UMR 6207  du CNRS et des Universit´es Aix-Marseille I, Aix-Marseille  II, et du Sud Toulon-Var; laboratoire aﬁli´e `a la FRUMAM  FR 2291 . aSuch scenario is based on physical grounds, some concrete indications from perturbation theory, and the validity of the so-called no-hair theorem.  241   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 242  242  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  Another classical indication is Hawking area theorem [84] stating that for mild energy conditions  satisﬁed by classical matter ﬁelds  the area of a black hole horizon can only increase in any physical process. Namely, the so-called second law of black hole mechanics holds:  δA ≥ 0.  This brings in the irreversibility characteristic of thermodynamical systems to the context of black hole physics and motivated Bekenstein [33] to associate with BHs a notion of entropy proportional to their area. Classically, one can also prove the so-called ﬁrst law of BH mechanics [31] relating diﬀerent nearby stationary BH spacetimes of Einstein-Maxwell theory  δM =  δA + ΩδJ + ΦδQ,  κ 8π  where Ω is the angular velocity of the horizon, Φ is the horizon electric potential, and κ is the surface gravity.  The realization that black holes can indeed be considered  in the semiclassical regime  as thermodynamical systems came with the discovery of black hole radiation [85]. In the mid 70’s Hawking considered the scattering of a quantum test ﬁeld on a space time background geometry representing gravitational collapse of a compact source. Assuming that very early observers far away from the source prepare the ﬁeld in the vacuum state he showed that, after the very dynamical phase of collapse is replaced by a stationary quasi equilibrium situation, late observers in the future measure an afterglow of particles of the test ﬁeld coming from the horizon with a temperature  TH =  κ 2π  .  As black holes radiate, the immediate conclusion is that they must evaporate through the  quantum phenomenon of  emission of Hawking radiation. The cal- culation of Hawking neglects such back reaction but provides a good approximation for the description of black holes that are suﬃciently large, for which the radiated power is small relative to the scale deﬁned by the mass of the black hole. These black holes are referred to as semiclassical in this chapter.  This result, together with the validity of the ﬁrst and second laws, suggest that semiclassical black holes should have an associated entropy  here referred to as the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy  given by   1    2    3    4   SH =  + S0  A 4 cid:9 2 P l  where S0 is an integration constant that cannot be ﬁxed by the sole use of the ﬁrst law. In fact, as in any thermodynamical system, entropy cannot be determined only by the use of the ﬁrst law. Entropy can either be measured in an experimental setup  this was the initial way in which the concept was introduced  or calculated from the basic degrees of freedom by using statistical mechanical methods once a model for the fundamental building blocks of the system is available.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 243  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  243  More precisely, even though the thermodynamical nature of semiclassical black holes is a robust prediction of the combination of general relativity and quantum ﬁeld theory as a ﬁrst approximation to quantum gravity, the precise expression for the entropy of black holes is a question that can only be answered within the framework of quantum gravity in its semiclassical regime. This is a central question for any proposal of quantum gravity theory.  This chapter will mainly deal with the issue of computing black hole entropy for semiclassical black holes which, as we will argue here, already presents an important challenge to quantum gravity but seems realistically within reach at the present stage of development of the approach. The formalism applies to physical black holes of the kind that can be formed in the early primordial universe or other astrophysical situations  no assumption of extremality or supersymmetry is needed .  Questions related to the information loss paradox, or the fate of unitarity are all issues that necessitate full control of the quantum dynamics in regimes far away from the semiclassical one. For that reason we designate this set of questions as the hard problem. These involve in particular the understanding of the dynamics near and across  what one would classically identify with  the interior singularity. There are studies of the quantum dynamics through models near the  classically apparent  singularities of general relativity indicating that not only the quantum geometry is well deﬁned at the classically pathological regions, but also the quantum dynamics is perfectly determined across them. For the variety of results concerning cosmological singularities we refer the reader to Chapter 6. Similar results have been found in the context of black holes [12]. These works indicate that singularities are generically avoided due to quantum eﬀects at the deep Planckian regime. Based on these results new paradigms have been put forward concerning the hard problem [11]. The key point is that the possibility of having physical dynamics beyond the apparent classical singularities allows for information to be lost into causally disconnected worlds  classical singularities as sinks of information  or to be recovered in subtle ways during and after evaporation as suggested by results in 2d black hole systems [22–24]. All these scenarios would be compatible with a local notion of unitarity [127]. The information paradox could also be solved [106] if quantum correlations with the  discrete  UV Planckian degrees of freedom remain hidden to low energy  semiclassical  observers. This possibility is appealing in an approach such as LQG where continuum space-time is obtained by coarse graining [18, 21, 123]. Space limitations prevent us from discussing the hard problem further in this chapter.  To date, investigations within the LQG framework, can be divided into the fol- lowing categories: isolated horizons and their quantum geometry  Sections 2 and 3 ; rigorous counting of micro-states  Section 4 ; semiclassical quasi-local formulation  Section 5 ; spin foam dynamical accounts and low energy dynamical counterparts  Section 6.3 ; and the Hawking eﬀect phenomenology and insights from symmetry reduced models  Section 6.5 . The diﬀerent sections are largely self-contained so they can be read independently.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 244  244  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  2. Isolated Horizons  The model employed to describe black holes in loop quantum gravity is based on the use of isolated horizons  IH , a concept introduced around the year 2000 by Ashtekar and collaborators [8–10, 17] and developed by a number of other researchers [99, 101].b The main goal of this line of work was to ﬁnd a quasilocal notion of horizon that could be used in contexts where the teleological nature of event horizons  i.e. the need to know the whole spacetime in order to determine if they are present  is problematic.  The most important features of isolated horizons are: their quasilocal nature, the availability of a Hamiltonian formulation for the sector of general relativity containing IH’s, the possibility of having physically reasonable versions of some of the laws of black hole thermodynamics and the existence of quasilocal deﬁnitions for the energy and angular momentum. It is important to remark, already at this point, the striking interplay between the second and the third issues.  The quasilocality of isolated horizons reﬂects itself in the fact that they can be described by introducing an inner spacetime boundary and imposing boundary conditions on the gravitational ﬁeld deﬁned on it  either in a metric or a connection formulation . As we want to describe black holes in equilibrium, it is natural to look for particular boundary conditions compatible with a static horizon but allowing the geometry outside to be dynamical  admitting, for example, gravitational radiation . This will lead us to consider a sector of general relativity signiﬁcantly larger than the one consisting of standard black hole solutions.  The sector of the gravitational phase space that we will be dealing with ad- mits a Hamiltonian, hence, it is conceivable to quantize it to gain an understanding of quantum black holes. This is one of the advantages of working with isolated horizons and a very non-trivial fact because such a Hamiltonian formalism is not always available for interesting sectors of general relativity. The approach that we will follow is somehow reminiscent of the study of symmetry reductions of general relativity  mini and midisuperspaces . As the sector of the phase space of the re- duced system is large enough — actually inﬁnite dimensional — it seems reasonable to expect that the quantum model that we consider will provide a good physical approximation for the equilibrium phenomena that we want to discuss,c in partic- ular the microscopic description of black hole entropy and the Bekenstein-Hawking area law.  We review next the construction of isolated horizons justifying, along the way, the conditions that have to be incorporated during the process. The main results regarding the geometry of isolated horizons can be found in [20]. We will be deﬁning diﬀerent types of null hypersurfaces until we arrive at the concept of isolated horizon. In the process we will introduce the notation that will be used in the following.  bThe mathematical foundations of the subject were developed by Kupeli in Ref. [22]. cThe quasilocal description of dynamical black hole behaviors can be achieved by using the so- called dynamical horizons [19].

A 3-dimensional embedded submanifold Δ ⊂ M will be called a null hy- persurface if the pull-back gΔ ab of gμν onto Δ is degenerate. This condition implies the existence of a null normal  cid:9 a tangent to Δ. Notice that there is not a unique projection of tangent vectors X μ sitting on p ∈ Δ onto the tangent space TpΔ and,  hence, it is impossible to deﬁne an induced connection on Δ.   cid:2   b  aa cid:2  ga  ab = gΔ   cid:2  Δ gΔ  Non-expanding null hypersurfaces: The degeneracy of the metric gΔ  ab implies that there is not a unique inverse metric, however it is always possible to ﬁnd gab Δ such that gΔ b cid:2 b. If  cid:9 a is a ﬁeld tangent to Δ consisting of null normals, we L cid:5 gΔ deﬁne its expansion θ cid:5  associated with a particular choice of gab ab. The invariance under rescalings implies that this expansion cannot be associated in an intrinsic way to the null hypersurface Δ unless it is zero. Null hypersurfaces with zero expansion in the previous sense will be referred to as non-expanding.  Δ as θ cid:5  := gab Δ  Non-expanding horizons  NEH : As we want to model black holes in four di- mensions — for which the horizons have a simple geometry — we will require that:  i  Δ is diﬀeomorphic to S2 ×  0, 1  where S2 is a 2-sphere.  ii  For each x ∈ S2 this diﬀeomorphism maps {x} ×  0, 1  to null geodesics on Δ.  iii  For each t ∈  0, 1 , S2 × {t} is mapped onto a spacelike 2-surface in Δ. We impose now a key phys- ical condition by requiring that the metric gμν be a solution to the Einstein ﬁeld equations and demanding that the pull back of the stress-energy-momentum tensor ab cid:9 a cid:9 b ≥ 0. This is equivalent to the condition Tμν on Δ satisﬁes the condition T Δ ab cid:9 a cid:9 b ≥ 0 on the pull-back of the Ricci tensor to Δ. The preceding conditions on RΔ non-expanding null surfaces deﬁne non-expanding horizons. An important feature of them is that, as a consequence of the non-expansion condition, cross-sections are marginally trapped surfaces and have constant area. Also, the Raychaudhuri equa- tion together with the non-expanding condition implies that RΔ ab cid:9 a cid:9 b = 0 and L cid:5 gΔ ab = 0. This can be interpreted as the fact that non-expanding horizons are  ab cid:9 a cid:9 b = T Δ  in equilibrium.  Weakly isolated horizons  WIH : In order to incorporate the laws of black hole mechanics to the present quasilocal framework we need to add additional structure to the preceding constructions. For example, the notion of temperature for ordinary black holes relies on the concept of surface gravity κ  see, for example, [124] . We can introduce now a rather similar concept by imposing additional requirements to NEH’s. Given a non-expanding horizon, it can be shown [see [10, 17, 20, 98]] that the spacetime connection ∇ induces a unique connection D compatible with the induced metric gΔ ab. We also declare as equivalent all the normal null ﬁelds related by constant rescalings  we denote these equivalence classes as [ cid:9 ] . A weakly isolated horizon is now a pair  Δ, [ cid:9 ]  consisting of a non-expanding horizon Δ and class of null normals [ cid:9 ] such that   L cid:5 Da − DaL cid:5   cid:9 b = 0 .   5   Geometrically this requirement is equivalent to the condition that some components of the connection deﬁned by D are left invariant by the diﬀeomorphisms deﬁned by  cid:9    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 246  246  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  on Δ  or roughly speaking are “time independent” . This means that ∇ cid:5  cid:9  = κ cid:9  with κ constant for each  cid:9  ∈ [ cid:9 ]. It is important to mention here that diﬀerent choices of [ cid:9 ] lead to inequivalent weakly isolated structures on the same non-expanding horizon.  Isolated horizons  IH : Isolated horizons are weakly isolated horizons  Δ, [ cid:9 ]  for  which   L cid:5 Da − DaL cid:5  τ b = 0 ,   6  for every tangent ﬁeld τ a on Δ. This condition can be read as [L,D]Δ = 0. An important diﬀerence between WIH’s and IH’s is that, whereas a given non- expanding horizon admits inﬁnitely many weakly isolated horizon structures, for an isolated horizon the only freedom in the choice of null normals consists of constant rescalings [20].  Non-trivial examples of all these types of horizons can be found in the extensive literature available on the subject  see [20] and references therein ; in any case it is important to keep in mind that any Killing horizon diﬀeomorphic to S2 × R is an isolated horizon so the concept is a genuine — and useful — generalization that encompasses all the globally stationary black holes.  Multipole moments can be used to deﬁne spherically symmetric isolated horizons in an intrinsic way [15, 16]. They are useful because, for stationary spacetimes in vacuum, they determine the near horizon geometry. Concrete expressions for these objects can be written in terms of the Ψ2 Newmann-Penrose component of the Weyl tensor. In the spherically symmetric case ImΨ2 = 0 and ReΨ2 is constant which implies that the only non-zero multipole moment is M0. This condition provides the intrinsic characterization mentioned above.  The zeroth and ﬁrst laws of black hole mechanics have interesting generalizations for weakly isolated and isolated horizons. In the case of the zero law the geometric features of weakly isolated horizons guarantee that a suitable concept of surface gravity can be introduced. This is done as follows [20]. For a non-expanding horizon Δ the null normal  cid:9 a has vanishing expansion, shear and twist. It is then straightforward to show that there must exist a 1-form ωa on Δ such that ∇a cid:9 b = ωa cid:9 b and  L cid:5 ω a = 0  the last condition as a consequence of the deﬁnition of weakly  cid:9 a as κ cid:5  :=  cid:9 aωa we have dκ cid:5  = d ωa cid:9 a  =  L cid:5 ω a = 0 and hence κ cid:5  is constant  isolated horizon . Deﬁning now the surface gravity associated with the null normal  on the horizon. This is analogous to the behavior of the surface gravity for Killing horizons and provides us with the sought for generalized zeroth law.  The generalization of the ﬁrst law of black hole dynamics requires the deﬁnition of a suitable energy associated with the isolated horizon. A way to proceed is to look for a Hamiltonian description for the sector of general relativity containing IHs. The availability of such a formulation is a very non-trivial and remarkable fact, and it is a necessary ﬁrst step towards quantization. In general covariant theories the Hamiltonian generating time translations is given by a surface integral  once the constraints are taken into account . In the present case there will be, hence, an   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 247  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  247  energy associated with the isolated horizon  and an extra ADM term corresponding to the boundary at inﬁnity .d In practice, associating a Hamiltonian to the bound- ary Δ requires the choice of an appropriate concept of time evolution deﬁned by vector ﬁeld ta with appropriate values ta Δ at the horizon. In simple examples  for instance, non-rotating isolated horizons  it is natural to take ta Δ proportional to the null normal  cid:9 a, however, there is some freedom left in the choice of  cid:9 a by the IH boundary conditions. By choosing ta Δ in such a way that the surface gravity is a speciﬁc function of the area  and other charges  one ﬁnds that the ﬁrst law is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the evolution generated by ta Δ to be Hamil- tonian [20]. In this way, there is a family of mathematically consistent ﬁrst laws parametrized by these choices.  The textbook approach to obtain the Hamiltonian would consist in starting from a suitable action principle for general relativity in a spacetime manifold with an inner boundary where the isolated horizon boundary conditions are enforced. This action can be written in principle both in terms of connection or metric vari- ables. The standard Dirac approach to deal with constrained systems  or more sophisticated formalisms such as the one given in [81]  can then be used to get the phase space of the model, the symplectic structure, the constraints and the Hamil- tonian [43]. Notice that owing to the presence of boundaries one should expect, in principle, a non-zero Hamiltonian consisting both in horizon contributions  deﬁning the horizon energy EΔ in terms of which the ﬁrst law is spelled  and the standard ADM energy associated with the boundary at inﬁnity. A diﬀerent approach that has some computational advantages relies on the covariant methods proposed and developed in [52, 53]. Their essence is to directly work in the space of solutions to the Einstein ﬁeld equations with ﬁelds subject to the appropriate boundary condi- tions  in particular the isolated horizon ones . Despite the fact that the solutions to the ﬁeld equations in most ﬁeld theories are not known it is possible to obtain useful information about the space of solutions and, in particular, the symplectic form deﬁned in it.  As this is a crucial ingredient to understand the quantization of the model and the quantum geometry of isolated horizons we sketch now the derivation of the symplectic structure based on covariant phase space methods. Let us suppose that I = 1, . . . , 4 in the spacetimee  M, gμν  and the frame we have a local coframe eI connection ΓI ν = 0 with ΓIJ +ΓJI = 0. If we denote tangent vectors  at a certain solution eI   as δeI it is straightforward to show that the 3-form deﬁned on M by  J deﬁned by deI +ΓI J  ∧eJ  μ ,  ω δ1, δ2  :=  εIJKLδ[1 eI ∧ eJ   ∧ δ2]ΓKL − 1  δ[1 eI ∧ eJ   ∧ δ2]ΓIJ   7   1 2  γ  is closed if eI is a solution to the Einstein ﬁeld equations  in the previous expression γ is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter . This means that if we have two 3-surfaces Σ1 dSimilar arguments apply to the angular momentum. eηIJ denotes the Minkowski metric. working with diﬀerential forms.  In the following we will suppress spacetime indices when   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 248   cid:5   Σ  248  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  and Σ2 deﬁning the boundary of a 4-dim submanifold of M then  Ω δ1, δ2  =  ω δ1, δ2    8   is independent of Σ. If an inner boundary, such as an isolated horizon, is present then a similar argument leads to the obtention of the symplectic form. Indeed, let us take a region of M with an inner boundary Δ  a causal 3-surface  and a family of spatial 3-surfaces Σ such that every pair Σ1 and Σ2, deﬁnes a 4-dim spacetime region bounded by Σ1, Σ2 and the segment of the surface Δ contained between the 2-surfaces Σ1 ∩ Δ and Σ2 ∩ Δ. Let us suppose also that, for every pair of tangent vectors δ1, δ2, there is a 2-form α δ1, δ2  on Δ such that the pullback of ω onto Δ is exact [ωΔ δ1, δ2  = dα δ1, δ2 ]. When these conditions are satisﬁed it is possible to generalize  8  in such a way that, in addition to the bulk term obtained above, it also has a surface term and the resulting expression is still independent of the choice of Σ   cid:5   Ω δ1, δ2  =  ω δ1, δ2  +  α δ1, δ2  .   9   Σ∩Δ  These types of surface terms are deﬁned both for weakly isolated horizons or spher- ical isolated horizons as inner boundaries. In the case of weakly isolated horizons of ﬁxed area A it is possible to perform a gauge ﬁxing such that the only symmetry left is a U  1  symmetry. In such a situation it is possible to see that the surface contribution to  9  has the form  where V is a U  1  connection on the spheres S that foliate the horizon. It is impor- tant to notice that this is a U  1  Chern–Simons symplectic form. It is convenient now to rewrite the bulk term by using Ashtekar variables as  It is necessary to mention at this point [13] that the values of the U  1  connection and the pullbacks of the connection triad variables are not independent but are connected through a horizon constraint of the formf   dV  ab +   cid:4 abc Ec  i ri   = 0 .  2πγ A   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  cid:27   Δ  The quantum version of this condition plays a central role in the quantization of this model.  For spherical isolated horizons it is possible to deﬁne the Hamiltonian framework without gauge ﬁxing on the horizon [58–60]. In such formulation the symplectic form in the ﬁeld space has an SU  2  Chern–Simons surface term of the form   cid:5   S  A  8π2 1 − γ2 γ  δ1Ai ∧ δ2Ai ,  fHere ri denotes a ﬁxed internal vector and we have used units such that 8πG = 1.   10    11    12    13    cid:5   Σ  A πγ   cid:5    cid:5   S  δ[1V ∧ δ2]V  2  δ[1Ea i  Σ  ∧ δ2]Ai a .

At ﬁrst sight there seems to be a mismatch in the number of conditions. In fact, as a consequence of the gauge ﬁxing that reduces the SU  2  triad rotation in the bulk to U  1  on the boundary, one has two extra conditions on the ﬂuxes corresponding to  Ec  i xi  i yi = 0 = Ec   15  where xi and yi are internal directions orthogonal to each other and to ri. We see that the three conditions in  14  are recovered. Due to the non-commutativity of the Ec i the previous conditions cannot be satisﬁed in the quantum theory: only  12  is imposed in the U  1  framework. As a result the U  1  framework slightly over counts states, a fact which  under qualiﬁcations that are discussed at the end of Section 3  is reﬂected in the form of logarithmic corrections to the micro canonical entropy  see table in Section 4 .  3. Quantum Geometry of Weakly Isolated Horizons  The formulation put forward in the preceding section can be used to identify the degrees of freedom that account for the black hole entropy and understand their quantum origin. It is precisely the quantum geometry associated with weakly iso- lated horizons that will let us understand the origin of black hole entropy in the LQG framework. As we will discuss in this section a special role will be played by the quantum horizon boundary conditions. For simplicity of exposition we will restrict ourselves to the setting provided by Type I WIH’s and suppose that we do not have matter nor extra charges. The starting point of the following construction is a WIH of ﬁxed areag a. As we mentioned in the preceding section the sector of general relativity consisting of solutions to the Einstein ﬁeld equations on regions bounded by weakly isolated horizons admits a Hamiltonian formulation so that its quantization can be considered in principle. It is important to point out, however, that the following construction must be based on the use of connection-triad vari- ables of the Ashtekar type  see Chapter 1 . To our knowledge such a construction is not available in the geometrodynamical framework h. One of the reasons for this is the central role that Chern-Simons theories play in the following arguments. gAnd ﬁxed charges, in general. hAs mentioned in Section 2 there is a boundary contribution to the gravity symplectic form that can be written as an SU  2  Chern-Simons symplectic form in connection variables.

The previous  δ1ei ∧ δ2ei.   cid:4   S  non-commutativity of ﬂuxes is characteristic of the bulk holonomy ﬂux algebra [14].

Perez  We have chosen to describe with some degree of detail the U  1  gauge ﬁxed formulation of quantum IHs. The SU  2  invariant framework [58, 59] can be con- structed along similar lines. In addition to the point discussed at the end of the previous section, the main advantage of the latter is that both boundary and bulk ﬁelds possess the same gauge symmetry. This allows the IH quantum constraints to be interpreted as ﬁrst class constraints generating the common symmetry [59]. Results of the SU  2  invariant formulation will be presented without details at the end of the section.  A very striking feature of the construction that we have discussed at the end of the preceding section is the presence of a surface term in the symplectic structure. Such surface terms are usually absent for ﬁeld theories with boundaries  at least in simple models, see [26] . They are a very distinctive feature of the present approach. From the point of view of the quantization of the model this surface term strongly suggests the necessity to introduce a Hilbert space associated with the boundary. The fact that it corresponds to a Chern-Simons model directly leads to the consideration of a Chern-Simons quantization.  In statistical mechanics, the classical and quantum degrees of freedom that ac- count for the entropy of a thermodynamical system are usually the same. For example the atoms in a gas, interpreted as point particles in a box, are in one to one correspondence with the quantum degrees of freedom used to model the gas as an ensemble of particles in an inﬁnite potential well. In the present case the logi- cal interpretation of the results about the speciﬁcation of spacetimes with isolated horizons [99] implies that there are no classical degrees of freedom associated with them. What is then the origin of the entropy of black holes in this setting? The answer lies in the nature of equations  12  and  14 . More precisely, the intersec- tions of the edges of the spin network  excitations of the ﬁeld Ea i   used to represent a suitable quantum bulk state are treated as point particle defects at the horizon — eﬀectively excising them. The degrees of freedom of the horizon Chern-Simons theory created in this way are responsible for the entropy.  The construction of the LQG Hilbert spaces has been summarized in Chapter 1. In the present context we will import results from these constructions — for the bulk degrees of freedom — and also from the quantization of Chern-Simons theories to deal with the horizon [7]. As mentioned before it is natural to introduce a Hilbert  space H = HS ⊗HV where the Hilbert spaces HHor and HBulk are associated with The volume or bulk Hilbert space HBulk is a subspace of the usual LQG Hilbert space L2  ¯A, μAL  deﬁned in a suitable space of generalized connections with the help  the horizon and the bulk spacetime respectively.  of the uniquely deﬁned Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure  see Chapter 1 . A useful orthonormal basis for this type of Hilbert space is provided by spin networks with edges that  may  transversally pierce the inner spacetime boundary that models the black hole. These points will be referred to as punctures; they are endowed with the quantum numbers that label the edges deﬁning them. By using these punctures   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 251  251   16    17   it is possible to represent the bulk Hilbert space as an orthogonal sum [55]  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes   cid:20   HBulk =  HP,j,m  Bulk   P,j,m   extended to all the possible ﬁnite sets P = {P1, . . . , Pn} consisting of points at the  spherical sections of the horizon. The  j, m  labels correspond to edges piercing the horizon transversally and the empty set corresponds to spin networks that do not pierce the horizon.  In order to construct the surface Hilbert space it is necessary to excise the punctures from the sphere S at the horizon and study the quantization of a Chern- Simons model in the resulting punctured surface. From a classical point of view this modiﬁcation of the horizon topology has the eﬀect of introducing topological degrees of freedom in the model  that can be thought of as the holonomies around closed loops surrounding the punctures of the otherwise ﬂat connection , however one has to keep in mind that these punctures are induced by spin network states deﬁned in the bulk, hence, they have a quantum origin.  The Chern-Simons quantization requires us to impose a prequantization condi- tion on the classical horizon area. In the present situation, it reads [7] Aκ = 4πγ cid:9 2 P lκ with κ ∈ N. In analogy with the bulk Hilbert space HV the surface Hilbert space  can be conveniently written as an orthogonal sum in the form   cid:20      cid:7 P ,b   HHor =  H  cid:7 P ,b  Hor  where now  cid:2 P stands for an ordered n-tuple of points on the “horizon” S labeled by integers mod κ  bi ∈ Zκ, i = 1, . . . , n  satisfying the condition b1 + ··· + bn = 0. Here H∅  = { cid:2 0}.  At this stage in the process both spaces are completely independent. The key element that establishes a relationship between them is the quantized version of the horizon boundary conditions that we have discussed at the end of the preceding Sec- tions 12, 14. It is very important to highlight here the fact that the operators that appear in these quantized boundary conditions are deﬁned in completely unrelated Hilbert spaces; hence, the fact that there exist solutions to these quantum bound- ary conditions is highly non-trivial. Of course, one has also to take into account the quantized constraints in the bulk Hilbert space by using the standard LQG methods  Dirac quantization, group averaging, etc., see Chapters 1 and 2 . The implementation of the quantum boundary conditions leads to a subspace consisting of orthogonal sums of elements of the form  HP,j,m  Bulk  ⊗ H  cid:7 P ,b   18   such that the points in the set P coincide with those in the vector  cid:2 P and the bi labels associated with the punctures satisfy the condition bi = −2mi mod κ  for  i = 1, . . . , n.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 252  252  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  Up to this point the construction has given us some kind of kinematical Hilbert space adapted to the present situation where we have inner spacetime boundaries.i We still have to take into account the rest of the constraints in the model. This is done by following the standard procedure  see Chapters 1 and 2  and making some assumptions — presumed mild — regarding solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint [7].  One of the key insights in the development of the present framework was the introduction by Krasnov [95–97] of the area ensemble. In the absence of a suitable notion of energy such deﬁnition seemed natural: the area is an extensive quantity with a well understood discrete spectrum. This state of aﬀairs has evolved due to results [65] that provide an interpretation of the horizon area as a quasilocal notion of energy. This will be discussed in the last two sections of this chapter. It is important to highlight, at this point, that area and angular momentum play a fundamental role already at the classical level in the IH framework whereas mass is a derived physical magnitude.  The customary way to deﬁne the entropy starts by considering the prequantized  value of the area Aκ and introducing an area interval [Aκ − δ, Aκ + δ] of width δ of the order of the Planck length.j Once this is done the entropy can be computed by tracing out the bulk degrees of freedom to deﬁne a density matrix describing a maximal mixture of states on the horizon surface S with area eigenvalues in the  ! previous interval. In order to count the number of states in [Aκ − δ, Aκ + δ] we have to ﬁnd out how many lists of non-zero elements of Zκ satisfy the condition i=1 bκ = 0 with bi = −2mi mod κ  for a permissible list of labels m1, . . . By permissible we mean that there must exist a list of non-vanishing spin labels ji such that each mi is a spin component of ji  mi ∈ {−ji,−ji +1 . . . , ji}  and the following  n  inequality holds  Aκ − δ ≤ 8πγ cid:9 2  P l   cid:2  ji ji + 1  ≤ Aκ + δ .  n cid:8   i=1   19   In principle the preceding discussion gives a concrete prescription that deﬁnes the counting  combinatorial  problem that has to be solved in order to compute the en- tropy for a given value of the prequantized area Aκ. This is generalized to arbitrary values of the area by allowing Aκ to be replaced by any arbitrary value A.  The preceding combinatorial problem can be considered as it is  and, in fact, when the ﬂux operator is used it can be solved in a relatively straightforward way . However, there is a neat way to simplify it known as the Domagala-Lewandowski  DL  approach [55]. By carefully considering the details of the problem it is possible  iNotice, however, that the quantum boundary conditions, arising from consistency requirements for the Hamiltonian formulation of the sector of general relativity that we are considering here, can also be thought of as constraints and, from this perspective, what we have really done is to implement them `a la Dirac. jA diﬀerent construction is possible if one uses the so-called ﬂux operator [25] to deﬁne the entropy. In this case there is no need to introduce an area interval to solve the quantum matching conditions though, on physical grounds, it is useful to introduce it afterwards.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 253  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  253  to pose it in such a way that only one type of labels appear  instead of the three labels in the original formulation, viz. ji, mi, bi . In the new rephrasing the entropy is computed as log n A  where n A  is 1 plus the number of ﬁnite sequences of non-zero integers or half-integers satisfying the following two conditions  and the so-called projection constraint  n cid:8    cid:2   i=1  mi mi + 1  ≤ A 8πγ cid:9 2 P l  ,  n cid:8   i=1  mi = 0 .   20    21   A diﬀerent approach corresponds to the models described by Ghosh and Mitra  GM  [71, 73] leading to the deﬁnition of the entropy as log n A  where n A  is 1 plus the number of all ﬁnite, arbitrarily long sequences   j1, m1 , . . . ,  jN , mN    of ordered pairs of non-zero, positive half integers ji and spin components mi ∈ {−ji,−ji + 1, . . . , ji} satisfying  n cid:8    cid:2   i=1  ji ji + 1  ≤ A 8πγ cid:9 2 P l  ,  n cid:8   i=1  mi = 0 .   22   The diﬀerence between the DL and the GM deﬁnitions of the counting problem resides in the following technical point. As two punctures with diﬀerent spins j  cid:10 = j  cid:3  but with the same magnetic number m are, from the boundary U  1  Chern-Simons theory, indistinguishable, they are considered as physically equivalent in the DL prescription. In the GM prescription the previous two conﬁgurations are considered as diﬀerent and counted individually. This apparent ambiguity of prescriptions disappears in the SU  2  invariant formulation where, roughly speaking, the states of the Chern-Simons boundary connection depend both on j and m. To leading order the counting in the SU  2  invariant formulation agrees with the GM prescription  see table in Section 4 .  Up to this point we have described the U  1  framework, which among other things, involves the quantization of condition  12  and its variants. Let us now brieﬂy present the SU  2  framework following from the quantization of the system containing  14 . The ﬁrst models using SU  2  Chern-Simons theory were proposed by Kaul and Majumdar [93]. The complete SU  2  framework, including the classical description of the theory, was proposed by Engle, Noui and Perez in [58–60]. The entropy in this case is computed as log n A  where n A  is 1 plus the number of all ﬁnite, arbitrarily long sequences  j1, . . . , jN   of non-zero, positive half-integers ji satisfying the inequality  n cid:8    cid:2   i=1  ji ji + 1  ≤ A 8πγ cid:9 2 P l  ,   23   and counted with multiplicity given by the dimension of the invariant subspace  Inv ⊗i [ji].

Perez  The next section will be devoted to introducing eﬃcient methods to solve the diﬀerent types of combinatorial problems involved in the computation of the entropy in the diﬀerent proposals. These methods are based in number-theoretic ideas and provide a powerful setup to deal with the broad class of problems arising in the study of black holes in LQG.  4. Counting and Number Theory  The diﬀerent models for semiclassical black holes described in the preceding section provide concrete examples of the kind of counting problems that have to be solved in order to compute the black hole entropy as a function of the area  and other physical features such as angular momentum . They are remarkable for several reasons. First, they are relatively easy to state and, in fact, reduce to the counting of speciﬁc types of ﬁnite sequences of integers or half integers subject to simple conditions. Furthermore their resolution can be tackled by using methods that combine known types of Diophantine equations, the use of generating functions and Laplace transforms.  As we will show in the following all the black hole models that have been dis- cussed so far in the LQG framework lead to the Bekenstein-Hawking law. Some of them, in particular the older ones [6, 74, 93], require the ﬁne tuning of the Im- mirzi parameter to get the correct proportionality factor between area and entropy; others give results consistent with the ﬁrst law and equation  4  without any ﬁne tuning [75, 76]  see Section 5 . It is important to point out at this point that the fact that the entropy grows linearly in the asymptotic limit of large areas is not a generic behavior. At ﬁrst sight the situation seems to be quite similar to that of a  0   cid:10 = 0 for which suﬃciently regular real function f  A  satisfying f  0  = 0 and f Taylor’s theorem implies that in the A → 0 asymptotic limit f  A  ∝ A. However the limit that we are considering is A → ∞ and the function of interest  the entropy  is not analytic but, actually, has a staircase form  though it can be written in terms of non-trivial integral expressions . In such circumstances the linear asymptotic behavior for large areas is certainly signiﬁcant and becomes a genuine nontrivial prediction of the model.   cid:3   We want to make some additional comments regarding the counting entropy before describing in some detail the mathematical methods necessary to eﬃciently solve the combinatorial problems involved in its computation. The ﬁrst has to do with its behavior for small areas that was considered in detail by Corichi, Diaz Polo and Fernandez Borja [50, 51]. Quite unexpectedly one ﬁnds a regular step structure that persists for a reasonably wide interval—microscopic in any case—of areas  a detailed account of the mathematical reasons for this phenomenon can be found in [27] . This is mildly reminiscent of the predictions by Bekenstein, Mukhanov and others [34, 35] regarding a “quantized” area spectrum. In the face of it this does not seem to be utterly unexpected because the area operator, with its discrete spectrum, plays a central role in the formalism. However, the eigenvalues of the   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 255  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  255  area are not equally spaced and their density  as a function of the area  grows very fast whereas the width of the steps seen in the entropy is both exact and persistent  although they eventually disappear .  A second relevant comment has to do with the rigorous notion of thermodynamic limit [82]. This has important implications for the mathematical properties of the entropy as a function of its natural variables  the energy in the case of statistical mechanics . In this limit  that can be computed by working with the counting entropy that we are considering here  the entropy is smooth almost everywhere — which implies that standard thermodynamical formulae can be used — and is concave  downwards . A consequence of this last fact is that the step structure for small areas should not be directly observable  although it can possibly have some kind of impact on its properties . Another important consequence of this is the change in the predictions for the subdominant corrections to the entropy for large areas  that actually disappear for some models [58–60] .  The general structure of the combinatorial problems that have to be solved is the following. In all the cases one must count the number of ﬁnite, arbitrarily long, sequences of non-zero half-integers satisfying an inequality condition involving the horizon area. These numbers are associated with spin network edges that pierce the horizon and quantum numbers coming from the Chern-Simons sector at the horizon. In the case of the original U  1  proposal of Ashtekar, Baez, Corichi and Krasnov [6] the associated combinatorial problem was rephrased in a convenient simpliﬁed way [55, 102] that did not involve directly the spin labels ji associated with the punctures at the horizon but, rather, the magnetic quantum numbers mi  satisfying the condition −ji ≤ mi ≤ ji . For a given value of the horizon area these numbers have to satisfy the inequality  and the projection constraint  N cid:8    cid:2   i=1  mi mi + 1  ≤ A 8πγ cid:9 2 P l N cid:8   ,  mi = 0 ,  i=1   24    25   In other proposals, such as the GM prescription [74], the combinatorial problem is expressed in terms of both the spin labels ji of the edges that pierce the horizon and the mi labels. There is an inequality  similar to  24   and a projection constraint with the same form as before  N cid:8    cid:2   i=1  ji ji + 1  ≤ Ak 8πγ cid:9 2 P l  ,  N cid:8   i=1  mi = 0 .   26   Notice how these two counting problems are diﬀerent: in the ﬁrst one both con- ditions involve the mi labels whereas in the second the ji and mi labels are quite independent  though they must satisfy the restriction −ji ≤ mi ≤ ji . In the SU  2    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 256  256  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  models [58–60] the projection constraint is replaced by a condition involving the di- mension of the invariant subspace. Lack of space precludes us from delving into the details of all the diﬀerent cases and proposals so we will describe only the DL approach in some detail and refer the reader to the literature for the rest. In the rest of this section we will use units such that 4πγ cid:9 2  P l = 1.  In order to count the number of sequences as required by the previous prescrip- tion it is convenient to adopt a stepwise approach. This has been explained in detail elsewhere [2, 3] so we give here a summary of the procedure. The main steps are:  N cid:8    cid:2   i=1  1. For each ﬁxed value of the area a obtain all the possible choices for the positive  half-integers mi compatible with it in the sense that they satisfy  mi mi + 1  =  A 2  .   27   At this stage the numbers mi can repeat themselves and are not ordered. In  other words, in this ﬁrst step we just want to ﬁnd out how many times each spin component appears  how many 1 2’s, how many 1’s, and so on .  2. Count the diﬀerent ways in which the multiset just described can be reordered. 3. Count all the diﬀerent ways of introducing signs in the sequences of the previous  step in such a way that the condition  N i=1 mi = 0 is satisﬁed.  4. Repeat this procedure for all the eigenvalues of the area operator smaller than  !  A and add up the number of sequences thus obtained.  The ﬁrst step is a characterization of the part of the spectrum of the area operator relevant to the computation of black hole entropy, in particular the degeneracy of the area eigenvalues. The condition  27  can be rewritten as   28   where we have introduced integer labels ki := 2mi. The non-negative integers Nk  that will be allowed to be zero  in the last sum tell us the number of times that the label k 2 ∈ N 2 appears in the sequence. We also denote as kmax = kmax A  the maximum value of the positive integer k compatible with the given area A. The problem that we need to solve at this step can be rephrased as that of ﬁnding all the sets of pairs { k, Nk  : k ∈ N, Nk ∈ N ∪ {0}} satisfying  28 . It  is important to notice now that  28  implies that the area eigenvalue a must be an integer linear combination of square roots of squarefree numbers of the form A =  kmax cid:8  qi ∈ N ∪ {0} , so that we have the condition  imax cid:8   imax i=1 qi   cid:2   √  pi,  !   k + 1 2 − 1 =  Nk  k=1  i=1  √  qi  pi .   29   where the right-hand side is ﬁxed from the initial choice of area eigenvalue A. The resolution of the previous equation is quite direct although the procedure,   cid:2   k + 1 2 − 1 = A  Nk  kmax cid:8   k=1   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 257  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  257  that involves the solution of the quadratic Diophantine equation known as the Pell equation and an auxiliary set of linear Diophantine equations, is somewhat lengthy. The interested reader is referred to [2, 3] for details. The ﬁnal result of the analysis sketched at this step is a characterization of the number of times that each spin label corresponding to a puncture can appear for a given area eigenvalue.  The second step simply requires us to count the number of ordered sequences containing the number of each label obtained in the previous step and is completely straightforward. Once we have found all the possible sequences of positive half-  ! integers mi satisfying condition  27 , the third step asks for the computation of the number of ways to introduce signs in each mi in such a way that the condition N i=1 mi = 0 is satisﬁed. There are several ways to solve this problem as described in [3]. The simplest one makes use of generating functions and is actually the preferred one as generating functions play a fundamental role in this framework  as ﬁrst explored and explained by Sahlmann [112, 113] . The other methods are interesting because they suggest deep connections between the ideas presented here with other physical problems, in particular those involving conformal ﬁeld theories [4].  The last step requires us to add up the number of conﬁgurations corresponding to all the area eigenvalues smaller than or equal to A. The best way to do this makes again use of generating functions [2, 112, 113] and Laplace transforms  see references [2, 102] . Generating functions are a very powerful tool in combinatorics because they can encode a lot of useful information about a particular problem and can be manipulated with very simple analytical tools. In the present case the step by step procedure described above leads to concrete forms for the generating functions for all the problems described before and others considered in the literature [58–60]. In the speciﬁc example of the DL counting the generating function is [28]  GDL z, x1, x2, . . .   =  zki  α + z  −ki  α  xyi  α  i  .   30     1 −  ∞ cid:8   ∞ cid:8    cid:3   i=1  α=1  $−1   cid:4   √  α, yi  !  α  are solutions to the Pell equation deﬁned by the ith square ··· ]GDL z, x1, x2, . . .   contain the informa-  Here the pairs  ki free integer. The coeﬃcients [z0][xq1 tion on the number of conﬁgurations compatible with a certain value of the area pi. Once the generating function is at hand it is possible to use it to get a very useful integral representation [29, 102] that takes the form of an double inverse Laplace-Fourier transform.  1 xq2  qi  2  The usefulness of Laplace transforms to deal with counting problems in this setting was pointed out by Meissner in reference [102]. In addition to providing a way to eﬀectively deal with step 4 in our scheme it is important also from the point of view of statistical mechanics and has been used to gain some understanding about the thermodynamic limit for black holes [30]. The underlying reason is the fact that the passage from the microcanonical to the canonical ensembles can be understood precisely in terms of Laplace transforms. This way we get the following   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 258  258  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  expression for the entropy  exp S A  =   cid:5    cid:5   2π  x0+i∞   cid:3   1   2π 2i  0  x0−i∞  −1  s  1 − 2  ∞ cid:8   k=1  √  −s e   cid:4 −1   31   k k+2  cos ωk  eAs ds dω ,  where x0 is a real number larger than the real part of all the singularities of the integrand.k The treatment of other models such as the ones proposed by Ghosh, Mitra  GM , and Engle, Noui, Perez  ENP  basically diﬀer only on the treatment of the projection constraint. Relevant details can be found in reference [3].  In addition to the cases mentioned above it is sometimes useful to consider the simpliﬁed model in which the projection constraint is ignored. Physically this corresponds to a situation in which the entropy satisﬁes the Bekenstein-Hawking law with no logarithmic corrections. In this simpliﬁed example the generating function is just     cid:3   ∞ cid:8   α=1  ∞ cid:8  1 − 2 ∞ cid:8   i=1  √  −s e  k=1  xyi  α  i  $−1  cid:4 −1  .  GDL 0  x1, x2, . . .   =   32    cid:5   leading to the following expression for the entropy  exp S A  =  1 2πi  x0+i∞  x0−i∞  −1  s  1 − 2  k k+2   eAs ds .   33   Let us now brieﬂy explain how the asymptotic behavior of the entropy is ob- tained. To this end one should remember that whenever a function is represented as an inverse Laplace transform  a so-called Bromwich integral such as  33   its asymptotic behavior as a function of the independent variable  the area A in this case  is determined by the analytic structure of the integrand, speciﬁcally the po- sition of the singularity s0 with the largest real part. In the present case, after reintroducing units for the sake of the argument, we get  where S0 is a constant independent of the area A. The preceding expression tells us that we exactly recover the Bekenstein-Hawking law by choosing γ such that  S A  = S0 +  Re s0   πγ  A 4 cid:9 2 P l  .  γ =  Re s0   .  π   34    35   The analytic structure of the integrand in  33  has some very interesting features such as the accumulation of the real parts of its singularities [29] that reﬂect them- selves in the behavior of the entropy. The expression  33  is very useful to explore kThis expression is actually valid only for those values of the area a ≥ 0 that do not belong to the spectrum of area operator whereas for an in the spectrum of the area operator it gives the arithmetic mean of the left and right limits when a → a± n . In practice the integral representation contains all the information about the entropy in a useful form.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 259  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  259  these issues as only the complex variable s is relevant  the discussion when the projection constraint is also taken into account is slightly more involved .  In the present example the entropy S A  displays a simple linear growth for large values of the area  without any logarithmic corrections  with a slope that depends on the Immirzi parameter γ. An interesting fact is that the value of the parameter γ is the same for a number of diﬀerent types of black holes although diﬀerent proposals such as [6, 58–60, 73] lead to diﬀerent values for it. The larger ones correspond to those cases where the number of microstates is larger as can be easily deduced from  34 . At variance with this behavior it is interesting to mention that the subdominant logarithmic corrections are independent of γ.  The values of the Immirzi parameter leading to the Bekenstein-Hawking law and the logarithmic corrections for the diﬀerent models and proposals are the following:  Approach T  γ T  Log correction T  Log corr. therm. limit  DL 0   DL GM ENP  γDL = 0.237··· γDL = 0.237··· γGM = 0.274··· γENP = γGM  0  − 1 − 1 − 3  2 log A  cid:9 2 2 log A  cid:9 2 2 log A  cid:9 2  P l  P l  P l   log A  cid:9 2 P l  1 2 log A  cid:9 2 P l  exercise  0  The ﬁrst column refers to the four diﬀerent models considered  the one provided by the DL prescription without and with the projection constraint, the GM approach and the ENP model . The diﬀerence between the results for the DL prescription with and without the projection constraint is the presence of a negative logarith- mic correction for the latter. This is to be expected as the incorporation of the projection constraints eliminates some microstates that are taken into account in the DL 0  model. A similar argument applies to the GM and ENP cases; the −3 2 coeﬃcient for the logarithmic correction in the latter case means that the number of microstates allowed is smaller than for the GM proposal. See the discussion at the end of Section 3.  5. Semiclassical Advances  The indeterminacy, mentioned in Section 2, of the quantities appearing in the ﬁrst law for IHs disappears if one changes the point of view and assumes that the near horizon geometry corresponds to that of a stationary black hole solution and shifts the perspective to that of a suitable family of stationary nearby local observers. As explained in Section 2 the whole idea behind isolated horizons is to describe a sector of the phase space of gravity containing a boundary with the geometric properties of a BH horizon in equilibrium and inﬁnitely many bulk degrees of freedom. In such context no condition in the deﬁnition requires the near-horizon geometry to be that of a stationary black hole. A key point is that the systems that behave thermodynamically are those solutions in the phase space of IH whose near horizon In geometry  NHG  is that of a stationary black hole solution [64, 65, 75, 76].   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 260  260  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  the quantum theory this would amount to selecting a bulk quantum state that is semiclassical and peaked on the stationary black hole conﬁguration near the isolated horizon.  At present there is not enough control on the nature of the physical Hilbert space to be able to describe such states in detail  current status is reported in Chapter 2 . Nevertheless, one can assume that such states exist and bring in their semiclassical properties into the analysis. This semiclassical input has led to interesting new insights into the black hole entropy calculation that we will brieﬂy review here. This perspective opens a variety of new questions and tensions waiting to be resolved. We shall discuss them in the following section.  Assume that the NHG to be isometric to that of a Kerr-Newman BHs.l A family of stationary observers O located right outside the horizon at a small proper A is deﬁned by those following the integral curves of the Killing  distance  cid:9   √  vector ﬁeld  χ = ξ + Ω ψ = ∂t + Ω ∂φ,  where ξ and ψ are the Killing ﬁelds associated with the stationarity and axisymme- try of Kerr-Newman spacetime respectively, while Ω is the horizon angular velocity. The four-velocity of O is given by  ua =  χa  cid:31 χ cid:31  .  It follows from this that O are uniformly accelerated with an acceleration a = −1 + o  cid:9   in the normal direction. These observers are the unique stationary ones  cid:9  that coincide with the locally non-rotating observers [124] or ZAMOs [121] as  cid:9  → 0. As a result, their angular momentum is not exactly zero, but o  cid:9  . Thus O are at rest with respect to the horizon which makes them the preferred observers for studying thermodynamical issues from a local perspective.  It is possible to show that the usual ﬁrst law  2  translates into a much simpler relation among quasilocal physical quantities associated with O [65]. As long as the spacetime geometry is well approximated by the Kerr Newman BH geometry in the √ local outer region between the BH horizon and the world-sheet of local observers A  1, the at proper distance  cid:9 , and, in the leading order approximation for  cid:9   following local ﬁrst law holds    W TμνuμdW ν =  cid:31 χ cid:31 −1     δE =  δA,  κ 8π  W TμνχμdW ν represents the ﬂow of energy where δE = across the world-sheet W deﬁned by the local observers, and κ ≡ κ   cid:31 χ cid:31  . The above result follows from the conservation law ∇a Tabχb  = 0 that allows one to write δE as the ﬂux of Tabχb across the horizon. This, in turn, can be related to changes in its area using the optical Raychaudhuri equations [65].  lSuch assumption is physically reasonable due to the implications of the no-hair theorem.   36    37    38    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 261  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  261  Two important remarks are in order: First, there is no need to normalize the Killing generator χ in any particular way. The calculation leading to  38  is invariant under the rescaling χ → αχ for α a non-vanishing constant. This means that the argument is truly local and should be valid for more general black holes with a Killing horizon that are not necessarily asymptotically ﬂat. This rescaling invariance of the Killing generator corresponds precisely to the similar arbitrariness of the generators of IHs as described in Section 2. The fact that equation  38  does not depend on this ambiguity implies that the local ﬁrst law makes sense in the context of the IH phase space as long as one applies it to those solutions that are isometric to stationary black hole solutions in the thin layer of width  cid:9  outside the horizon. The semiclassical input is fully compatible with the notion of IHs. −1 in its leading order √ A  1. This is not surprising and simply reﬂects the fact that in √ behavior for  cid:9   A → ∞ with  cid:9  held ﬁxed the NHG in the thin layer outside the horizon the limit becomes isometric to the corresponding thin slab of Minkowski spacetime outside a Rindler horizon: the quantity ¯κ is the acceleration of the stationary observers in this regime. Therefore, the local surface gravity loses all memory of the macro- scopic parameters that deﬁne the stationary black hole  see Section 5.2.1 for further discussion . This implies that, up to a constant which one sets to zero, equation  38  can be integrated, thus providing an eﬀective notion of horizon energy  Second, the local surface gravity ¯κ is universal ¯κ =  cid:9   E =  A  ,  8πGN  cid:9    39   where GN is Newton’s constant. Such energy notion is precisely the one to be used in statistical mechanical considerations by local observers. Similar energy formu- lae have been obtained in the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity with boundary conditions imposing the presence of a stationary bifurcate horizon [45]. The area as the macroscopic variable deﬁning the ensemble has been always used in the context of BH models in loop quantum gravity. The new aspect revealed by the previous equation is its physical interpretation as energy for the local observers. The thermodynamical properties of quantum IHs satisfying the NHG condition can be described using standard statistical mechanical methods with the eﬀective Hamiltonian that follows from equation  39  and the LQG area spectrum  see Chap-  ter 1 , namely  cid:26 Hj1, j2 ··· cid:9  =    γ   cid:9 2 P l  2GN  cid:9    cid:8    cid:31   $  jp jp + 1   j1, j2 ··· cid:9    40   p  √ G cid:2  is the where jp are positive half-integer spins of the p-th puncture and  cid:9 P l = fundamental Planck length associated with the gravitational coupling G in the deep Planckian regime. The analysis that follows can be performed in both the micro- canonical ensemble or in the canonical ensemble; ensemble equivalence is granted in this case because the system is simply given by a set of non-interacting units with discrete energy levels.

Pure Quantum Geometry Calculation  In this section we compute black hole entropy ﬁrst in the microcanonical ensemble following a simpliﬁed  physicist  version [72] of the rigorous detailed counting of the previous section. As the canonical ensemble becomes available with the no- tion of Hamiltonian  40 , we will also derive the results in the canonical ensemble framework. The treatment in terms of the grand canonical ensemble as well as the equivalence of the three ensembles has been shown [76].  Denote by sj the number of punctures of the horizon labelled by the spin j. Ignoring the closure constraint, and in the SU  2  Chern-Simons formulation of quantum IHs, the number of states associated with a distribution of distinguishable  punctures {sj}∞  is  j= 1 2  where N ≡ !  ∞ cid:17   j= 1 2  n {sj}  =  N ! sj!   2j + 1 sj ,  j sj is the total number of punctures. The leading term of the microcanonical entropy can be associated with S = log n {¯sj}  , where ¯sj are the  solutions of the variational condition  δ log n {¯sj}   + 2πγ0δC1 {¯sj}  + σC2 {¯sj}  = 0   cid:2    cid:8   cid:8   j  j  where 2πγ0  the 2π factor is introduced for later convenience  and σ are Lagrange multipliers for the constraints C1 {¯sj}  = C2 {¯sj}  =  j j + 1 sj − A 8πγ cid:9 2 P l sj − N = 0.  = 0,   43   In words, ¯sj is the conﬁguration maximizing log n {sj}   for ﬁxed macroscopic area A and number of punctures N . Notice that C1 was not imposed in the treatment of Section 4.m Ignoring C1 amounts to setting the punctures chemical potential ¯μ = 0. However, as we will show here, allowing for non-vanishing chemical potential provides a whole new look at the question of the dependence of entropy on the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.  A simple calculation shows that the solution to the variational problem  42  is  =  2j + 1  exp −2πγ0  j j + 1  − σ ,  ¯sj N   44    cid:2   from which it follows, by summing over j, that the Lagrange multipliers are not independent   cid:8   2j + 1  exp −2πγ0   cid:2   exp σ γ0  =  j  j j + 1  .   45   mThe physicist method of this section can be made precise using the counting techniques of Section 4. The counting with ﬁxed N is proposed as an exercise to the reader who is referred to [61] for relevant equations.   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 263  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  It also follows from  44 , and the evaluation of S = log n {¯sj}  , that  What is the value of the Lagrange multiplier γ0? As in standard thermal systems the value of γ0 is related to the temperature of the system.

The previous condition allows one to express the Lagrange multiplier γ0 in terms of the  otherwise arbitrary  Barbero- Immirzi parameter γ, G, and GN , namely  and thus  where  γ0 = γ  G GN  ,  4 cid:2 GN  A   cid:8   j  S =  + σ γ N.  σ γ  = log[   2j + 1 e  −2πγ G  GN ]  263   46    47    48    49   Notice that the ﬁrst term in the entropy formula is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking area law with the low energy value of Newton constant GN ; in other words it does not depend explicitly on the fundamental Planck length  cid:9 P l appearing in the area spectrum. Even though this is to be expected as the Bekenstein-Hawking term is a semiclassical quantity, the above result sheds new light on a long standing discussion in the community as to which is the value of Newton’s constant that should go into the area spectrum. Due to quantum eﬀects Newton’s constant is expected to ﬂow from the IR regime to the deep Planckian one. The Planckian value of the gravitational coupling should be deﬁned in terms of the fundamental quantum of area predicted by LQG yet the low energy value should appear in the entropy formula. The semiclassical input that enters the derivation of the entropy through the assumption of  39  is the ingredient that bridges the two regimes.  Finally, punctures are associated with a chemical potential which is given by  ¯μ = −T  ∂S ∂N  E  = −  cid:9 2 P l 2π cid:9   σ γ    50   which depends on the ﬁducial length scale  cid:9  and the Barbero-Immirzi parame- ter, and where one is again evaluating the equation at the Unruh temperature T =  cid:2   2π cid:9  .   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  cid:27    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 264  264  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  The above derivation can be done in the framework of the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. From the technical perspective it would have been simpler to do it using one of those ensembles. In particular basic formulae allow for the calculation of the energy ﬂuctuations which at the Unruh temperature are such that  ΔE 2  cid:8 E cid:9 2 = O 1 N  . The speciﬁc heat at TU is C = N γ2 0 d2σ dγ2 which is positive. This implies that as a thermodynamic system the IH is locally stable. The speciﬁc heat tends to zero in the large γ limit for ﬁxed N and diverges as  cid:2  → 0. The three ensembles give equivalent results [76].  5.1.1.

At ﬁrst sight the previous equation does not look like  2 . However, it is immediate to check that the exotic chemical potential term in  52  cancels the term proportional to the number of punctures in the entropy formula  49 . For  51  this is due to the equation of state  50 ; for  52  this is due to the form of μ. Therefore, the above balance equation is just exactly the same as  2 . The diﬀerent versions of the ﬁrst law are presented in Table 1. Notice that only those on the left column are to be interpreted thermodynamically. Assuming the validity of semiclassical consistency discussed here for general accelerated observers in arbitrary local neighborhoods [90], the emergence of general relativity directly from the statistical mechanics of the polymer like structures of LQG has been argued [116].  5.1.2. Recovering the results of Section 3  As we mentioned above the key diﬀerence with the counting of Section 3 is the imposition of the constraint C2 in  43 . One can therefore recover the results by simply setting the Lagrange multiplier σ = 0 from the onset of the calculation in Section 5.1. What happens then is that equation  45  completely ﬁxes γ0 to the numerical value: in the present case γ0 = 0.274.... Equation  48  — which continues to hold — introduces a strong constraint between fundamental constants; namely  γ  G GN  = γ0 = 0.274...,   53    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 265  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  265  Table 1. Diﬀerent versions of balance equations. On the left column one has the results coming from quantum geometry involving a chemical potential term. The semiclassical input of the area eﬀective Hamiltonian in the quantum geometry statistical mechanics calculation leads to results that are consistent with the geometry ﬁrst laws shown on the right column.

The previous equation implies that S = A  4GN  cid:2  . Therefore, by declaring that the chemical potential of punctures vanishes ¯μ = 0  equivalently σ = 0  the semiclassi- cal consistency, equation  47 , is satisﬁed at the price of restricting the fundamental constants as above. It has been proposed that the previous equation, relating low energy GN with the fundamental couplings G and γ, could be interpreted in the context of the renormalization group ﬂow [91]. However, due to the completely com- binatorial way in which γ0 arises  which does not make reference to any dynamical notion  it is so far unclear how such scenario could be realized. The contribution of matter degrees of freedom  ‘vacuum ﬂuctuations’  to the degeneracy of the area spectrum has been neglected in the derivation leading to  53 .  5.2. Matter and Holography  In the framework based on quantum geometry, the imposition of the diﬀeomorphism constraint on the IH is subtle because it is represented as a punctured 2-sphere. A careful analysis [7] shows that the punctures have to be treated as distinguishable. This is the paradigm used in treatments mentioned so far. Nonetheless it is of interest to see what indistinguishability would change. Instead of the microcanon- ical ensemble, we use now the grand canonical ensemble as this will considerably shorten the derivations  keep in mind that all ensembles are equivalent . Thus we start from the canonical partition function which for a system of non-interactive punctures is Q β, N   = q β N  N ! where the N ! in the denominator is the Gibbs factor that eﬀectively enforces indistinguishability, and the one-puncture partition function q β  is given by  ∞ cid:8   j= 1 2  q β  =  dj exp −  cid:2 βγ0   ,   cid:9    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 266  266  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  where dj is the degeneracy of the spin j state  for instance dj =  2j + 1  as in the SU  2  Chern-Simons treatment . The grand canonical partition function is  Z  β, z  =  = exp zq β  .   54   From the equations of state E = −∂β log Z  , and N = z∂z log Z   one gets  ∞ cid:8   N =1  zN q β N  N !  A  8πGN  cid:9   = −z∂βq β   N = zq β  = log Z  .   55  In thermal equilibrium at the Unruh temperature one has β = 2π cid:9  cid:2 −1 and the  cid:9  dependence disappears from the previous equations. However, for dj that grow at most polynomially in j, the BH area predicted by the equation is just Planckian and the number of punctures N of order one. Therefore, indistinguishability with degeneracies dj of the kind we ﬁnd in the pure geometry models is ruled out because it cannot predict semiclassical BH’s.  An interesting perspective [75] arises in the framework of quasilocal observers. If one only restricts to quantum geometry degrees of freedom then dj = 2j + 1 in the SU  2  ENP treatment or dj = 1 in the GM and DL models. Now, from the local observers perspective, the quantum state of the system close to the horizon appears as a highly excited state at inverse temperature β = 2π cid:9   cid:9 2 P l. Of course this state looks like the vacuum state for freely falling observers  at scales smaller than the size of the BH . These two dual versions of the same physics tell us that the quantum state describing the near-horizon physics contains more than just pure quantum geometric excitations. Very general results from quantum ﬁeld theory on curved spacetimes imply that the quasilocal observers close to the horizon would ﬁnd that the number of degrees of freedom grows exponentially with the horizon area according to  see for instance [118]   D ∝ exp λA   cid:2 GN   ,   56   where λ is an unspeciﬁed dimensionless constant that cannot be determined due to two related issues: On the one hand UV divergences of standard QFT introduce regularization ambiguities aﬀecting the value of λ; on the other hand, the value of λ depends on the number of species of ﬁelds considered. For that reason, here we only assume the qualitative exponential growth and will prove below that the ambiguity in λ is completely removed by non-perturbative quantum gravity considerations.  ’  j dj with dj = exp λ8πγ0 . For simplicity let us take ≈ j + 1 2. We also introduce two dimensionless variables δβ and δh and write β = βU  1 + δβ  — where βU = 2π cid:9   cid:2  — and λ =  1 − δh  4. A direct calculation  From  56  D[{sj}] =  of the geometric series that follows from  54  yields  q β  =  exp −πγ0δ β   exp πγ0δ β   − 1  ,   57    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 267   cid:24    cid:25  1  2  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  267   cid:2   where δ β  = δh + δβ. The equations of state now predict large semiclassical BHs: for large A   cid:2 GN   equation  55  can be used to determine δ as a function of A GN  cid:2 z  πγ0A   1. For semiclassical BHs δβ  1 and z. The result is δ = 2 since the temperature measured by quasilocal observers must be close to the Unruh temperature, this, together with the previous equation for δ, implies δh  1. In  other words semiclassical consistency implies that the additional degrees of freedom producing the degeneracy  56  must saturate the holographic bound [75], i.e. λ = 1 4 up to quantum corrections. The entropy is given by the formula S = βE − log z N + log Z   which upon  evaluation yields  S =  A  4GN  cid:2   − 1 2   log z  − 1   zA πγ cid:9 2 P l   58   This gives the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy to leading order plus quantum correc- tions. If one sets the chemical potential of the punctures to zero  as for photons or gravitons  then these corrections remain. One can get rid of the corrections by set- ting the chemical potential μ = TU . Such possibility is intriguing, yet the physical meaning of such a choice is not clear at this stage. The thermal state of the system is dominated by large spins as the mean spin  cid:8 j cid:9  = A  N  cid:9 2 P l. The conclusions of this subsection hold for arbitrary puncture statistics. This is to be expected because the system behaves as if it were at a very high eﬀective temper- ature  the Unruh temperature is the precise analog of the Hagedorn temperature of particle physics  [75]. Because it will be important for further discussion we write the partition function corresponding to the choice of Bosonic statistics of punctures explicitly and for z = 1, namely  P l  grows like   cid:2   A  cid:9 2  Z  β  =  exp 2π cid:9  − β   aj  ,  8π cid:9 GN   59   ∞ cid:17    cid:8   j= 1 2  sj  where aj = 8πγ cid:9 2 P l are the area eigenvalues, and we have assumed for simplicity λ = 1 4 in  56 , namely dj = exp aj  4GN  cid:2   . Interestingly, such exact holographic behavior of the degeneracy of the area spectrum can be obtained from an analytic continuation of the dimension of the boundary Chern-Simons theory by sending the  spins ji → is − 1 2 with s ∈ R+ [62, 83]. The new continuous labels correspond to SU  1, 1  unitary representations that solve the SL 2, C  self antiself -duality constraints Li±K i = 0  see Chapter 3 , which in addition comply with the necessary reality condition E·E ≥ 0 for the ﬁelds Ea i  see Chapter 1 . All this suggests that the holographic behavior postulated in  56  with λ = 1 4 would naturally follow from the deﬁnition of LQG in terms of self antiself -dual variables, i.e. γ = ±i. The same holographic behavior of the number of degrees of freedom available at the horizon surface is found from a conformal ﬁeld theoretical perspective for γ = ±i [78]. A relationship between the thermal nature of BH horizons and self dual variables seems also valid according to similar analytic continuation arguments [108]. The analytic continuation technique has also been applied in the context of lower dimensional BHs [63].

What is the ensemble in the quasilocal treatment  The quasi local perspective provides a description complementary to the isolated horizon deﬁnition of the horizon Hilbert space. It allows one to perform manip- ulations in the canonical ensemble language. At the basic level the ensemble is still deﬁned by the details of the isolated horizon boundary conditions which tell us whether we are dealing with a spherical, distorted, rotating or static BH horizon. Even when charge and angular momentum do not appear in the expression of the quasi local ﬁrst law these parameters  and all multipole moments in the case of dis- torted isolated horizons [15, 16]  are encoded implicitly in the form of the boundary condition used to deﬁne the quantum theory of the horizon. Notice also that the usual canonical ensemble is ill deﬁned [86] because the number of states grows too fast as a function of the ADM energy. This problem disappears in the quasi local treatment where the area ensemble plays the central role.  6. Synergy as well as Tension between the Microscopic and Semi-  classical Descriptions  6.1. Spinfoams  In the covariant path integral representation of loop quantum gravity the state of a puncture  open spin network link  j, m cid:9  is embedded in the unitary representations of SL 2, C   whose basis vectors can be written as p, k; j, m cid:9  for p ∈ R+ and k ∈ N   according to j, m cid:9  → γ j + 1 , j; j, m cid:9 . The maximum weight states m = j deﬁne a puncture state which is in turn a coherent state peaked along the z-axis which is assumed  through an implicit gauge ﬁxing  to correspond to the normal to the horizon. We denote such states as follows  j cid:9  ≡ γ j + 1 , j; j, j cid:9 .   60  These states satisfy the simplicity constraints Li = γK i in a weak sense.  See Chap- ter 3. Note however that our Li, K i are denoted there by Bi, Ei respectively.  One postulates [40] that quantum horizon states  in the inﬁnite area limit, i.e. Rindler states  evolve in the time of stationary observers  37  — uniformly accelerated with a =  cid:9   −1 — according to  jt cid:9  = exp iHt j cid:9 ,   61  −1Kz the Rindler Hamiltonian. This time evolution is con- with H = aKz =  cid:9  sistent with the semiclassical condition  39 . More precisely from the simplicity constraints one has that  cid:8 jHj cid:9  =  cid:2 γj cid:9  −1 which coincides with the eigenvalue of E = A  8πGN  cid:9   for a single plaquette in the large j limit. By coupling the system with an idealized detector modeled by a two-level system [122] with energy separa- tion TU =  cid:2   2π cid:9    Δ cid:4  it is shown that the population of the excited state in the  stationary state is [40]  p1 ≈ exp − 2π cid:9   Δ cid:4  ,   cid:2    62    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 269  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  269  which is the Wien distribution at temperature TU =  cid:2   2π cid:9  . A key property [89] leading to this result is the fact that   cid:8 λj cid:9 2 ≈ λ2j exp −πλ    63   where λ cid:9  = γ j + 1 , j; λ, j cid:9  is an eigenstate of Kz and Lz with eigenvalues λ and  j respectively. In relation to this it has been postulated [47] that the one puncture reduced density matrix measuring the inside-outside correlations in spin foams is given by  exp −2πKz   ,  Z  ρp =   64  where Zp = Tr[exp 2πKz]. The single puncture entropy Sp = −Tr ρp log ρp   = ap  4G cid:2   + log Zp ; by adding this result for all punctures one gets a result of the form  49  with Zp playing the role of σ  notice that both are the single puncture par- tition function . In this way the results of the covariant and canonical approach are consistent. Notice that the fundamental input in the derivation of the temperature is that quantum horizon physical states are of the form  61 .  6.2. Entanglement Entropy Perturbations and Black Hole Entropy Starting from a pure state 0 cid:9  cid:8 0  “vacuum state”  one can deﬁne a reduced density matrix ρ = Trin 0 cid:9  cid:8 0  by taking the trace over the degrees of freedom inside the BH horizon. The entanglement entropy is deﬁned as Sent[ρ] = −Tr ρ log ρ  . In  four dimensions [117] the leading order term of entanglement entropy in standard QFT goes like  Sent = λ  A  cid:4 2 + corrections ,   65   where  cid:4  is an UV cut-oﬀ, and λ is left undetermined in the standard QFT cal- culation due to UV divergences and associated ambiguities. An important one is that λ is proportional to the number of ﬁelds considered; this is known as the species problem. These ambiguities disappear if one studies perturbations of  65  when gravitational eﬀects are taken into account [37, 39]. The analysis is done in the context of perturbations of the vacuum state in Minkowski spacetime as seen by accelerated Rindler observers. Entanglement entropy is deﬁned by tracing out degrees of freedom outside the Rindler wedge. Such system reﬂects some of the physics of stationary black holes in the inﬁnite area limit. A key property [126] is that, formally,    exp −2π Tr[exp −2π     Σ  ρ =  ˆTμνχμdΣν  ˆTμνχμdΣν  ]  ,  Σ   66   where Σ is any Cauchy surface of the Rindler wedge. If one considers a perturbation of the vacuum state δρ then the ﬁrst interesting fact is that the  relative entropy    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 270  270  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez   cid:5   Σ  δSent = Sent[ρ+δρ]−Sent[ρ] is UV ﬁnite and hence free of regularization ambiguities  [46]. The second fact is that due to  66  one has  δSent = 2πTr   δ cid:8 Tμν cid:9 χμdΣν .   67   Now from semiclassical Einstein’s equations ∇μδ cid:8 Tμν cid:9  = 0, this  together with the  global properties of the Rindler wedge  implies that one can replace the Cauchy surface Σ by the Rindler horizon H in the previous equation. As in the calculation leading to  38  one can use the Raychaudhuri equation  i.e. semiclassical Einstein’s  equations  to relate the ﬂux of δ cid:8 Tμν cid:9  across the Rindler horizon to changes in its area. The result is that δSent = δA 4GN  cid:2  independently of the number of species. The argument can be generalized to static black holes [106] where a preferred vacuum state exists  the Hartle-Hawking state . However, due to the fact that the BH horizon is no longer a good initial value surface the resulting balance equation is  δSent =  δA  4GN  cid:2   + δS∞,   68   where δS∞ = δE TH , and δE is the energy ﬂow at I + ∪ i+. Changes of entangle-  ment entropy match changes of Hawking entropy plus an entropy ﬂow to inﬁnity. These results shed light on the way the species problem could be resolved in quan- tum gravity. However, as the concept of relative entropy used here is insensitive to the UV degrees of freedom, the key question [106] is whether the present idea can be extrapolated to the Planck scale. The results described in Section 5.2 go in this direction.n  6.3. Entanglement Entropy vs. Statistical Mechanical Entropy  One can argue that the perspective that BH entropy should be accounted for in terms of entanglement entropy [117] and the statistical mechanical derivation pre- sented in this chapter are indeed equivalent in a suitable sense [106]. The ba- sic reason for such equivalence resides in the microscopic structure predicted by LQG [36, 38, 47]. In our context, the appearance of the UV divergence in  65  tells us that the leading contribution to Sent must come from the UV structure of LQG close to the boundary separating the two regions. Consider a basis of the subspace of the horizon Hilbert space characterized by condition  19 , and assume the discrete index a labels the elements of its basis. Consider the state  Ψ cid:9  =  αa ψa   cid:9 ψa   cid:9 ,  a  int  int  ext   cid:9  and ψa   69   cid:9  denote physical states compatible with the IH boundary data where ψa a, and describing the interior and the exterior states of matter and geometry of the nSince this article was completed, using coherent states Madhavan Varadarajan has pointed out in Gen. Rel. Grav. 48,  2016  35 that there is a conceptual diﬃculty in the identiﬁcation of variation of the entanglement entropy with that of the horizon area, made in Refs. [88,89]. Further work is needed to settle this issue.  ext   cid:8    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 271  Quantum Geometry and Black Holes  271  BH respectively. The assumption that such states exist is a basic input of Section 3. In the form of the equation above we are assuming that correlations between the outside and the inside at Planckian scales are mediated by the spin-network links puncturing the separating boundary. This encodes the idea that vacuum correlations are ultra-local at the Planck scale. This assumption is implicit in the recent treatments [36] based on the analysis of a single quantum of area correlation and it is related to the  Planckian  Hadamard condition as deﬁned in [47]. We also  cid:9  = 1, and assume states to be normalized as follows:  cid:8 ψa  cid:8 ΨΨ cid:9  = 1. The reduced density matrix obtained from the pure state by tracing over the interior observables is   cid:9  = 1,  cid:8 ψa  ψa  ψa  ext  ext  int  int   cid:8   ρext =  paψa  ext   cid:9  cid:8 ψa  ext  ,   70   with pa = αa2. It follows from this that the entropy Sext ≡ −Tr[ρext log ρext ] is  a  bounded by micro-canonical entropy of the ensemble  19  as discussed in Section 3. If instead one starts from a mixed state encoding an homogeneous statistical mixture of quantum states compatible with  19 , then the reduced density matrix leads to an entropy that matches the microcanonical one [106].  6.4. Euclidean Path Integral  the Quasi Local Treatment  and  Logarithmic Corrections  Here we review some basic features of the Euclidean path integral approach to the computation of BH entropy. Although the method is formal, as far as the contribution of geometric degrees of freedom is concerned, it allows one to study the contributions of matter degrees of freedom in the vicinity of the horizon. The formalism is relevant for discussing two important points. On the one hand it allows one to compare the partition function obtained in Section 5.2 with the ﬁeld theoretical formal expression  providing in this way another test for semiclassical consistency . On the other hand it provides one with the tools that are necessary for comparison and discussion of the issue of logarithmic corrections in LQG and in other approaches.  There is a well known relationship between the statistical mechanical partition  function and the Euclidean path integral on a ﬂat background. One has:   cid:5   Zsc β  =  Dφ exp{−S[φ]} ,   71   where ﬁeld conﬁgurations are taken to be periodic in Euclidean time with period β. Such expression can be formally extended to the gravitational context at least in the treatment of stationary black holes. One starts from the formal analog of the previous expression and immediately uses the stationary phase approximation to make sense of it on the background of a stationary black hole. Namely   cid:5   Zsc β  =  DgDφ exp{−S[g, φ]}   cid:5    cid:5      −  ≈ exp{−S[gcl, 0]}  Dη exp  dxdyη x   η y    72    cid:24    cid:25   0  δ2L  δη x δη y    February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 272  272  J. Fernando Barbero G. & A. Perez  where the ﬁrst term depends entirely on the classical BH solution gcl while the second term represents the path integral over ﬂuctuation ﬁelds, both of the metric as well as the matter, that we here schematically denote by η. For local ﬁeld theories δη x δη y L = δ x, y  cid:2 gc where  cid:2 gc is a Laplace-like operator.  Possible gauge symmetries, in particular diﬀeomorphisms, must be gauge ﬁxed to make sense of such a formula .  Let us ﬁrst concentrate on the evaluation of the classical action. In the quasi local treatment, the Euclidean space time region, where the ﬁelds η are supported, is given by a D × S2 where D is a disk in a plane orthogonal to and centered at the horizon radius and having a proper radius  cid:9   recall that in the Euclidean case the BH horizon shrinks to a point, represented here by the center of D . Using the Gibbons-Hawking prescription for the boundary term [79], the action S[gcl, 0] is  ⎡⎣  cid:5    cid:5   S[gcl, 0] =  1  8πGN  √  g R +   K − K0  dΣ  D×S2  ∂D×S2  ⎤⎦   73   On shell the bulk term in the previous integral vanishes. However, unless βH = −1, the geometry has a conical singularity at the centre of the disk and the ﬁrst 2πκ term will contribute. The boundary term is the usual one with K the extrinsic curvature of the boundary, dΣ its volume form, and K0 = −1  cid:9  is the value of the extrinsic curvature at the boundary in the A → ∞ limit  Rindler space-time . The subtraction of the counter term K0 has the same eﬀect as replacing the inner conical singularity by an inner boundary with a boundary term of the form βHA  8π  [45]. A direct calculation gives the semi-classical free energy  −S[gcl, 0] = log Zcl  =  2π cid:9  − β   A  ,  8πGN  cid:9    74   where β = βH cid:31 χ cid:31  is the local energy. The equation of state E = −∂β log Zcl   reproduces the quasilocal energy  39  — this is a consequence of the subtraction of K0 [128]. The entropy is S = βE +log Z  = A  4 cid:9 2 P l  when evaluated at the inverse Unruh temperature βU = 2π cid:9 . Notice that in the quasi-local framework used here, entropy grows linearly with energy  instead of quadratically as in the usual Hawking treatment . This means that the usual ill behavior of the canonical ensemble of the standard global formulation [86] is cured by the quasilocal treatment.  Notice that equation  74  matches in form the partition function  59 . In other words, the inclusion of the holographic degeneracy  56  plus the assumption of Bosonic statistics for punctures makes the results of Section 5.2 compatible with the continuous formal treatment of the Euclidean path integral. In essence  59  is a regularization of  72 .  Quantum corrections to the entropy come from the ﬂuctuation factor which can formally be expressed in terms of the determinant of a second order local  elliptic  diﬀerential operator  cid:2 gcl  0   cid:5   F =  Dη exp  dxη x  cid:2 gclη x   = [det  cid:2 gcl ]  − 1  2 .   75    cid:5      −   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 273  273   76    77   The determinant can be computed from the identity  the heat kernel expansion   Quantum Geometry and Black Holes   cid:5  ∞   cid:10 2  log [det  cid:2 gcl  ] =  Tr [exp −s  cid:2 gcl ] ,  ds s  ∞ cid:8   n=0  where  cid:4  is a UV cut-oﬀ needed to regularize the integral. We will assume here that it is proportional to  cid:9 P l. In the last equality we have used the heat kernel expansion in d dimensions  Tr [exp −s  cid:2 gcl  ] =  4πs   − d  2  ans  n  2 ,  where the coeﬃcients an are given by integrals in D × S2 of local quantities.  At ﬁrst sight the terms an with n ≤ 2 produce potential important corrections to  BH entropy. All of these suﬀer from regularization ambiguities with the exception of the term a2 which leads to logarithmic corrections. Moreover, contributions coming from a0 and a1 can be shown to contribute to the renormalization of various couplings in the underlying Lagrangian [115]; for instance a0 contributes to the cosmological constant renormalization. True loop corrections are then encoded in the logarithmic term a2 and for that reason it has received great attention in the literature  see Ref. [96] and references therein . Another reason is that its form is regularization independent. According to Ref. [66] there are no logarithmic corrections in the SU  2  pure geometric model once the appropriate smoothing is used  canonical ensemble . From this we conclude that the only possible source of logarithmic corrections in the SU  2  case must come from the non-geometric degrees of freedom that produce the so-called matter degeneracy that plays a central role in Section 5.2. A possible way to compute these corrections is to compute the heat kernel coeﬃcient a2 for a given matter model. This is the approach taken in Ref. [96] One can argue [75] that logarithmic corrections in the one-loop eﬀective action are directly reﬂected as logarithmic corrections in the LQG BH entropy. The preceding considerations partially dissipate the perceived tensions between the LQG approach and others. This is an important question that deserves further attention.  6.5. Hawking Radiation  Detailed derivation of Hawking radiation from ﬁrst principles in LQG remains an open problem, this is partly due to the diﬃculty associated with the deﬁnition of semiclassical states approximating space-time backgrounds. Without a detailed account of the emission process it is still possible to obtain information from a spectroscopical approach that uses as an input the details of the area spectrum in addition to some semiclassical assumptions [32]. The status of the question has improved with the deﬁnition and quantization of spherical symmetric models [66– 68, 77]. The approach uses techniques from ‘hybrid quantization’ and quantum ﬁeld theory on quantum space-times used in loop quantum cosmology  see Chapter 6 . More precisely, the quantum spherical background space-time is deﬁned using LQG techniques, whereas perturbations, accounting for Hawking radiation, are described   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 274  274  J.

Introduction  Building a quantum theory of space-time might be the most outstanding prob- lem of contemporary fundamental theoretical physics. Probably this is not mainly because uniﬁcation is necessary and unavoidable. Uniﬁcation is unquestionably a useful guide that has indeed helped a lot in the past but that might very well not be the ﬁnal word on what physics should look like. After all, it could be that diﬀerent subﬁelds of physics are described by diﬀerent theories. The key issue has more to do with consistency. In some physical circumstances quantum mechanics and strong gravity are both important. In addition, the quantum world has interactions with the gravitational ﬁeld itself, which automatically requires gravity to be understood in a quantum language, as can be demonstrated by appropriate thought experi- ments. Furthermore, because of the nonlinear nature of gravity, as soon as a strong gravitational ﬁeld is involved, the coupling to gravitons also becomes strong, whence one cannot ignore quantum eﬀects of gravity. The very existence of singularities in general relativity  GR  also requires a quantum extension. Finally, although the signal measured by the BICEP2 experiment [1] was not from cosmological origin, there is a reasonable hope that primordial gravitational waves will be soon seen through B-modes in the cosmological microwave background: this would be the ﬁrst direct observation of a quantum gravity phenomenon, albeit at a linear level, in the history of science.  Several non-perturbative and background-independent approaches have been de- veloped in the last decades. Among them, loop quantum gravity  LQG  may be  281   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 282  282  A. Barrau & J. Grain  the most advanced one  see [2] for introductions . One of the main achievements of LQG is that it has led an interplay between theory and experiments. At this stage, none of these ideas has been tested and some of them are still controversial. There are even tensions between diﬀerent approximation schemes within LGQ. Still, it is a remarkable achievement that a quantum theory of gravity is now able to produce a set of predictions that might be tested in a foreseeable future.  In this brief overview, we will ﬁrst focus on cosmology, considering diﬀerent probes, both direct and indirect. We will then consider possible consequences of a possible Lorentz invariance violation. Evaporating black holes will be reviewed next and, ﬁnally, we will mention new ideas about ‘Planck stars’.  2. Cosmology: Indirect Probes  When assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous, the Universe is suﬃciently sym- metric to be a quite easy system to quantize. As explained in Chapter 6, and as reviewed in [3], LQG ideas have been successfully applied to this speciﬁc situation: this is what loop quantum cosmology  LQC  describes. Although a rigorous deriva- tion of LQC from LQG is still missing, it is now fairly believed to capture eﬀectively most quantum eﬀects from the mother theory. Recent progress was reported, e.g. in [4]. The most important result is probably the singularity resolution: the Big Bang is replaced by a Big Bounce and the LQC dynamics is diﬀerent from the Wheeler-DeWitt one.  It is diﬃcult but possible to make predictions for perturbations in LQC. Two main paths are followed at this stage. On the one hand a ‘dressed metric ap- proach’ [5] was developed. It tries to deal deeply with quantum ﬁelds on a quantum background geometry. On the other hand, an ‘eﬀective approach’ [6] was investi- gated. It tries to avoid ﬁxing or assuming any background structure but instead derives it from eﬀective equations. Both deserve to be seriously considered.a In this section we therefore ﬁrst focus on more ‘reliable’ predictions related to the background evolution. Holonomy corrections appear in the theory because there is an operator that can only be associated with the holonomy of the Ashtekar con- nection, rather than the connection itself. Although the way those corrections are implemented, leading to the bounce, can of course be questioned, the main picture is now consistent and well established.  2.1. Isotropic Case  2.1.1. Initial conditions at the bounce  A ﬁrst approach, developed in [7], assumes that the bounce is the appropriate time to set initial conditions. This is reasonable as the bounce is the only ‘preferred’  aSince this overview was written, new results on the observational consequences of the deformed algebra approach were obtained in B.

The early Universe is also assumed to be ﬁlled with a massive scalar ﬁeld, as usually done in inﬂation.  2  B  √  3π λ   cid:29    cid:30  1  1 − x2  The idea is to solve, thanks to the bounce, the ambiguity that usually appears in the construction of a measure on the space of initial data. The space of solutions is isomorphic to a gauge ﬁxed surface, i.e., a 2-surface ˆΓ which is intersected by each dynamical trajectory only once. Since b, the conjugate momentum to the volume of the ﬁxed ﬁducial cell used in the quantization, is monotonic in each solution, the strategy is to choose for ˆΓ an appropriate 2-surface b = bo. Symplectic geometry considerations unambiguously equip ˆΓ with an induced Liouville measure dˆμL. A natural choice is to set bo = π 2λ, the value that characterizes the bounce, so that ˆΓ is naturally coordinatized by   ¯ϕB, vB , the scalar ﬁeld and the volume at the bounce. The induced measure is given by dˆμL = d ¯ϕB dvB , where x2 B is the value of x2 at the bounce  with x2 = m2 ¯ϕ2  2ρc  , that is the fraction of total energy density in form of potential energy at the bounce. After factoring out the gauge orbits the fractional volumes of physically relevant sub-regions of ˆΓ can be calculated. The main results of the study performed in [7], depending on 3 diﬀerent possible regimes, are:   for x2 −4, the number of e-folds during slow roll is given approximately by N ≈ 2π o ln ¯ϕo, where ¯ϕo is the value of the scalar ﬁeld at the onset of inﬂation and ¯ϕmax = 1.5 × 106. For ¯ϕB = 0.99, one has ¯ϕo = 3.24 and N = 68. Thus, there is a slow roll inﬂation with over 68 e-foldings for all ¯ϕB > 1, i.e., if B > 4.4 × 10 −13. x2   for 10 −4 < x2 B < 0.5, the LQC departures from GR are now signiﬁcant. The Hubble parameter is essentially frozen at a very high value. Throughout this range of x2   for 0.5 < x2 B   0, the inﬂaton climbs up the potential but the turn around   ˙¯ϕ = 0  occurs during super-inﬂation. The Hubble parameter freezes at the onset of inﬂation and the slow roll conditions are easily met as ˙H H 2 is less than 1 × 10 −11 when ¨¯ϕ = 0. There are many more than 68 e-foldings already in the super-inﬂation phase. The friction term is large and the inﬂation enters a long  more than 68 e-folds  slow roll inﬂa- tionary phase.  B there are more than 68 e-foldings.  1 − ¯ϕ2  B < 10   cid:3    cid:4   ¯ϕ2  ¯ϕ2  max  o  Basically all LQC dynamical trajectories are funneled to conditions which vir- tually guarantee slow-roll inﬂation with more than 68 e-foldings, without any input from the pre-big bang regime. This work was developed further, using analytical and numerical methods, to calculate the a priori probability of realizing a slow- roll phase compatible with CMB. It was found that the probability is greater than 0.999997 in LQC. This can be considered as a good indirect — although not deﬁni- tive — test of LQC.

Initial conditions in the remote past  In [7], the probability distribution is assumed to be ﬂat and deﬁned at the bounce  the ﬁrst attempts in this direction were performed in [8] . It is however possible to make a very diﬀerent assumption: the phase of the oscillations of the ﬁeld in the remote past can also be considered as a very natural random variable [9]. The choice of what is a natural measure depends heavily on when one decides to set initial conditions [10]. It is important to consider seriously the meaning of an ‘initial’ condition in a Universe that has a contracting branch before the bounce. In this approach one does not focus on the initial data at the bounce as in [7], but rather derives a probability distribution for them as a prediction of the model.  The approach consists in calculating the probability distribution for xB, the square root of the fraction of potential energy at the bounce, and N , the number of e-folds of slow-roll inﬂation. The most natural and consistent assumption is to set the initial probability distribution in the pre-bounce oscillatory phase where the Universe is in addition classical and therefore well under control. The evolution in this phase is described by: ρ = ρ0 , with x =  cos mt + δ . In fact, due to hidden symmetries, δ  2m sin 2mt + 2δ    cid:7  cid:7 −2  sin mt + δ  , y =  1 − 1   cid:31    cid:31   t + 1  3κρ0   cid:6    cid:6   √  2  ρ ρc  ρ ρc  can be shown to be the only parameter.  In addition of being the obviously expected distribution for any oscillatory pro- cess of this kind, a ﬂat probability for δ will be preserved over time during the pre-bounce oscillations, making it a very natural choice. This is not a trivial point as any other probability distribution would be distorted over time, meaning that the ﬁnal result in the full numerical analysis would depend on the choice of ρ0. Starting with a ﬂat probability distribution for δ, the probability for diﬀerent values of xB can be calculated numerically. In [7], xB is considered as unknown whereas, in this second approach [9], it is shown to be sharply peaked around 3.55 × 10 −6  this , where we assumed that m  1 in Plank units . value scales with m as m log The most likely solutions are exactly those that have no slow-roll deﬂation. The probability density for N can also be computed and is given in Figure 1, showing that the model leads to a slow-roll inﬂation of about 140 e-folds. This becomes, as shown in [9], a prediction of eﬀective LQC: inﬂation and its duration are not arbitrary anymore.   cid:7    cid:6   1 m  2.2. Anisotropic Case  In bouncing cosmologies, either from the loop approach or any other, the question of anisotropies is very important for a clear reason: the shear term varies as 1 a6 where a is the ‘mean’ scale factor of the Universe. When the Universe is contract- ing, the shear term becomes more and more important and eventually drives the dynamics. The reason for which the shear can be neglected in standard cosmology is precisely the reason why it becomes important in bouncing models. The question of predicting the duration of inﬂation in LQC was studied in the Bianchi-I case.

The main conclusion is that, in general, the number of e-folds decreases when the shear increases. But a greater shear will also lead to a larger spread in the number of e-folds, depending on the initial angle δ. The number of e-folds of slow-roll inﬂation depends strongly on ρmax which is ﬁxed only when the shear vanishes. At the bounce, the dynamics is completely driven by the kinetic energy and the shear. The kinetic energy grows a lot in a very short time, which gives the scalar ﬁeld a boost, and lifts it up to create the initial conditions for slow-roll inﬂation. If the shear is important, the bounce will happen at a lower value of the kinetic energy, and the scalar ﬁeld potential will not ‘climb’ as high as in the isotropic case.  Anisotropies lead to fewer e-folds of slow-roll inﬂation. It is however interesting that for a wide range of parameters, the probability distribution for the number of e-folds is peaked at values compatible with data, between 70 and 130 e-folds. It −2 = is worth noticing that whereas any value between 0 and Nmax = 2π 3.9× 1012 is a priori possible for N , the favored value is very close to the minimum  √ 2ρcm   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 287  Loop Quantum Gravity and Observations  287  required value. This makes the bounce inﬂation scenario particularly appealing for phenomenology: all the quantum information from the bounce might not have been washed out by inﬂation. Having N close to 70 is exactly what is required to lead to measurable eﬀects in the CMB spectrum. An important issue however remains: what would be a ‘natural’ initial value for the shear?  3. Cosmology: Direct Probes  Directly probing LQC modeling of the universe from astronomical observations follows the standard procedure used in classical cosmology to probe e.g. the physics of inﬂation. Any observer is conﬁned within the Universe and one relies on cosmic inhomogeneities  whose evolution across cosmic times depends on the dynamics of the Universe  as internal tracers. They are revealed by the observed galaxies and large scale structures, and by the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background  CMB . This however tells us that our Universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic, being ﬁlled with inhomogeneities, and can be modeled by a perturbed FLRW metric, for those inhomogeneities are small in the primordial Universe.  In classical cosmology, inhomogeneities are produced during inﬂation from the gravitational ampliﬁcation of the ﬂuctuations of the quantum vacuum. In the con- text of single ﬁeld inﬂation, the perturbations are of two types: scalar modes corre- sponding to perturbations of the scalar 3-dimensional curvature, denoted R, and, tensor modes hi a corresponding to primordial gravitational waves. They are com- monly described by the Mukhanov–Sasaki, gauge-invariant variables, vS = zR and  cid:3   a is the Hubble parameter in conformal time, vT = ah with z =  a ¯ϕ i.e. ds2 = a2 η  . The quantum ﬂuctuations of these two ﬁelds are dynamically ampliﬁed during the accelerated expanding inﬂationary phase. Since they originate from the quantum vacuum which is Gaussian  and assuming linear evolution for simplicity , the perturbations at the end of inﬂation, ηe, are fully described by their 2-points correlation function or, in Fourier space, by their pri- mordial power spectrum:    H and H = a  cid:3   dη2 − dxadxa   cid:7    cid:6   PS =  k3 2π   cid:8 R k  R cid:3  k  cid:9   ηe and PT =  16Gk3   hi a, s  k  ha  i, s  k   ,   3   ηe  6  2 cid:8   5  s=1  where the average is a quantum expectation value over the vacuum state. For tensor modes, the sum is over the two helicity degrees of freedom. At the end of inﬂation, our Universe is then ﬁlled with inhomogeneities of quantum origin: scalar perturbations serve as the primordial seeds for structures formation, and, both scalar and tensor perturbations leave their footprint in the CMB in the form of anisotropies of temperature and linear polarization. The latter is decomposed into two modes dubbed E and B modes. The statistics of these anisotropies follows the statistics of the cosmological perturbations and is Gaussian  primordial non- Gaussianities are observationally constrained to be extremely small . The observed information contained in the CMB is then compressed into six angular power spectra   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 288  288  A. Barrau & J. Grain  measuring the power of the T, E and B auto- and cross-correlations. These are estimated from the CMB observations and are theoretically related to the primordial power spectra via the line-of-sight solution of the Boltzmann equations [14]:   cid:5  ∞   cid:5   η0   cid:29    cid:30    k, η PS k  + ΔX,T   cid:5    k, η ΔY,T   cid:5    k, η PT k   ,  C XY   cid:5  =  dk  dη  ΔX,S   k, η ΔY,S   cid:5    cid:5   0  ηe   4  with X, Y running over T, E and B. The time integration is performed from the end of inﬂation to today, η0. The functions ΔX,S T  are the transfer functions encoding the evolution of scalar tensor  perturbations and the primordial power spectra are source terms. Fitting the predicted angular power spectra on the estimated ones allows for setting constraints on both cosmological parameters driving the dynamics of the homogeneous Universe via the transfer functions and cosmological parameters driving the shape of the primordial power spectra. Since the later are classically  derived from the inﬂationary dynamics, any constraints on PS T  from the CMB   cid:5   measurements can be translated into constraints on inﬂationary models.  In the context of LQC, the cosmological perturbations evolve through the con- tracting phase and the bounce prior to inﬂation. Because of that, one can expect  some distortions in the predicted PS T  as compared to the standard prediction of  pure inﬂation. The shape of primordial power spectra now contains information about the contracting phase and the quantum bounce in addition to information about inﬂation, and this will inevitably translate into distortions of the angular power spectra of the CMB anisotropies, leading to possible direct probes of this quantum gravity modeling of the Universe. The main prediction is therefore the primordial power spectra from which CMB angular power spectra are derived. Pre- liminary results were obtained by solely considering the change in the background evolution, the Universe passing through a contraction phase and bounce prior to inﬂation [15]. The distortions on the polarized CMB anisotropies could be observed from a clear inspection of those anisotropies and used to constrain e.g. the fraction of potential energy in the scalar ﬁeld at the time of the bounce [16]. However, the very fact that cosmological perturbations are to be constructed from a quantum theory of gravity was not properly taken into account, though the change of the Universe history was. Indeed, cosmological perturbations are perturbations of the gravitational ﬁeld itself  as well as perturbations of the matter content . This means that the classical theory of cosmological perturbations  consisting in linearizing the Einstein’s ﬁeld equations around the FLRW solution  should be amended ﬁrst for accounting that perturbations live in a quantum background.  3.1. Cosmological Perturbations in LQC  Diﬀerent approaches to treat cosmological perturbations in a LQC-derived cosmo- logical background have been developed recently. The dressed metric approach, discussed in Chapter 6, adopts a strategy in which the minisuperspace homoge- neous and isotropic degrees of freedom and the inﬁnitely many inhomogeneous   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 289  Loop Quantum Gravity and Observations  289  degrees of freedom  considered as perturbations  are quantized [5]. The for- mer is obtained by the loop quantization and the latter is obtained from a Fock quantization on a quantum background space-time. The physical inhomogeneous degrees of freedom are given by the Mukhanov-Sasaki variables derived from the linearized classical constraints. The second order Hamiltonian  restricted to the square of the ﬁrst order perturbations  is promoted to be an operator and the quantization is performed using techniques suitable for the quantization of a test ﬁeld evolving in a quantum background [17]. The Hilbert space is a tensor prod-  uct Ψ ν, vS T , ϕ  = ΨFLRW ν, ¯ϕ  ⊗ Ψpert vS, vT, ¯ϕ  with ν the homogeneous and isotropic degrees of freedom and vS T  the degrees of freedom for perturbations. In the interaction picture, so long as the backreaction of the perturbations on ΨFLRW remains negligible, the Schr¨odinger equation for the perturbations is shown to be identical to the Schr¨odinger equation for the quantized perturbations evolving in a classical background but using a dressed metric encoding the quantum nature of the background  for tensor modes :  i cid:2 ∂ ¯ϕΨpert =  1 2  d3k  2π 3  32πG  ˜pϕ  Ψpert +  k2  ˜a4  ¯ϕ   32πG  ˜pϕ  Ψpert  ,   5    cid:5    cid:18    cid:27  cid:27  cid:27 ˆπT, cid:7 k   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27 2  5  6  −1 =   ˜pϕ   −1 FLRW  ˆH  and ˜a4 =   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27 ˆvT, cid:7 k   cid:27  cid:27  cid:27 2 6  .  5  −1 2 FLRWˆa4  ¯ϕ  ˆH  −1 2 FLRW  ˆH  6  5  −1 FLRW  ˆH   cid:19   with  In the above,  ˆvT, cid:7 k, ˆπT, cid:7 k  are the conﬁguration and momentum operators of the perturbations while ˆHFLRW is the Hamiltonian operator of the isotropic and ho- mogeneous background. The dressed metric is in principle neither equal to the classical metric nor equal to the metric traced by the peak of the sharply peaked background state.

[18] consists in perturbing the semi- classical, eﬀective space-time whose dynamics is given by the modiﬁed Friedmann equations. The idea is to start from the classical perturbed Hamiltonian and to introduce corrections taking into account at the eﬀective level the quantum nature of the background. For the zeroth-order Hamiltonian, providing the dynamics of the background, such a modiﬁcation is easily obtained from the fact that the quan- tization being based on holonomies, the connection ¯k is replaced by , yielding the modiﬁed Friedmann equations. Similar eﬀective modiﬁcations are in- troduced to the ﬁrst and second order perturbation Hamiltonians. Though there is a priori much more freedom for those modiﬁcations, there expressions are univocally derived by requiring that ﬁrst, the classical Hamiltonian is recovered in the limit of large volumes  i.e. ¯μ → 0 , and, second, that the algebra of the truncated scalar, diﬀeomorphism and Gauss constraints is still closed, as is the case for truncated constraints in the classical theory of cosmological perturbations. This second re- quirement ﬁxes all the ambiguities of the introduced quantum corrections  at least for the case of holonomy corrections . Moreover, the set of eﬀective constraints is ﬁrst class and can be used to generate the gauge transformations to derive the ef- fective gauge-invariant variables for the cosmological perturbations. The dynamics is generated by the second-order, eﬀective Hamiltonian. Those perturbations are ﬁnally quantized `a la Fock using the techniques developed for quantum ﬁelds in curved spaces. In that process, it appears that the anomaly-free algebra of eﬀective constrained is deformed compared to the classical algebra of constraints by [19]:  7 {D[M a], D[N a]} = D[M b∂bN a − N b∂bM a], 7 = SQ[M a∂aN − N ∂aM a], D[M a], SQ[N ] SQ[M ], SQ[N ]  Ωqab M ∂bN − N ∂bM    8 8  = D     *  ,   11    12    13   with D the diﬀeomorphism constraint and SQ the scalar constraint. The defor- mation is encoded in Ω which depends on the background phase-space variables, Ω = cos 2γ ¯μ¯k  = 1 − 2ρ ρc.

Primordial Power Spectrum in Loop Quantum Cosmology  The primordial power spectra are the sources of the CMB anisotropies and are the key quantities to compute. Assuming some initial conditions for the mode functions, thus ﬁxing the choice of the initial quantum states for perturbations, the primordial power spectra are determined by the knowledge of the mode functions at the end of inﬂation. A ﬁrst choice of initial conditions for perturbations is a fourth order WKB vacuum at the time of the bounce. Such a choice is however only possible in the dressed metric approach. For the deformed algebra, Ω is negatively valued at the time of the bounce which prevents the existence of standard oscillatory solutions for the mode functions. An example of the resulting primordial power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations in the dressed metric approach and setting the initial conditions for perturbations at the time of the bounce is displayed in −1 Figure 3. This shows that the bounce leaves a characteristic length scale  k cid:3   as a typical footprint. For shorter length scales, k > k cid:3 , the predicted primordial power spectrum coincides with the prediction of standard inﬂationary cosmology since the slightly red-tilted power law is recovered. However for larger length scales, LQC predicts a diﬀerent power spectrum  which can be viewed as a running of the spectral index in the language of inﬂation . This typical scale can be intuitively  ˜a , tracing the eﬀective understood for tensor modes by a clear inspection of  ˜a ‘curvature’ of the background. For sharply peaked states, the dressed scale factor ˜a is very well approximated by the scale factor traced by the peak of the background quantum states, a, which is the solution of the modiﬁed Friedmann equations. At  a = 8πGρc and rapidly decreases in the beginning the time of the bounce, a of the expansion. Then, this quantity rapidly increases once the Universe enters its inﬂationary phase. The shape of the primordial power spectrum is driven by  k2 − a  cid:3  cid:3   a, the modes are oscillatory whereas in the opposite case, √ the mode functions are a linear combination of growing and decreasing modes. As a consequence, modes at very short scales, k  cid:28  k cid:3  with k cid:3  = 8πGρc, are aﬀected by the background ‘curvature’ during inﬂation only, explaining why the standard power law is recovered for the primordial power spectrum at these scales. However, the  dynamics of modes such that k ∼ k cid:3  is also aﬀected by the background ‘curvature’   a : if k2 > a   cid:3  cid:3    cid:3  cid:3    cid:3  cid:3   at the time of the bounce and one should expect for those modes a discrepancy as compared to the standard prediction of inﬂation.  −4Mpc  Such a length scale translates into a characteristic angular scale in the CMB angular power spectra.

This angular scale lies in the range of scales observed in the CMB anisotropies if k cid:3  t0  > kH  t0 .

If such a characteristic length scale is indeed in the range observed with the CMB, the slight boost of power for k  cid:3  k cid:3  will translate into a slight boost of the angular power spectrum of the CMB anisotropies  as compared to the inﬂationary prediction  for angular scales  cid:9   cid:3   cid:9  cid:3 .  √  Another possibility is to set the initial conditions for perturbations deep in the contracting phase. Then, for both the deformed algebra and dressed metric approaches, one can choose a Minkowski vacuum state for all the wavenumbers, 2k. In the dressed metric, the standard power law  vS T ,k η → −∞  = exp ikη   spectrum is recovered for k  cid:28  k cid:3  for the very same reason as described above: the modes are not aﬀected by the background ‘curvature’ during both the classical contraction and the quantum bounce. In the infrared limit, k → 0, the modes are mainly aﬀected by the background during contraction leading to a scale invariant power spectrum. In between, there is a range of modes which are not aﬀected by contraction but by the bounce. In that range of wavenumbers, the primordial power spectrum exhibits oscillations with an envelope exhibiting a boost of the power. As shown in Figure 4, the prediction diﬀers in the deformed algebra ap- proach [21]. For modes such that k > k cid:3 , the shape of the primordial spectrum is mainly driven by Ωk2. Since Ω is negative around the bounce, this leads to an exponential increase of the primordial power spectrum at short scales roughly given by PT k  cid:28  k cid:3   ∝ exp with η± deﬁning the time laps around the bounce during which Ω is negative. For larger length scales, k < k cid:3 , the term Ωk2 becomes subdominant in the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable. This regime is therefore very similar to the dressed metric approach pre- viously discussed and the scale invariant behavior in the infrared limit as well as the oscillations for intermediate scales are recovered. A detailed comparison of both approaches was made in [20].   cid:2 Ωdη1   cid:3    cid:4   η+ η−     k   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 293  Loop Quantum Gravity and Observations  293   cid:2 T  1013  109  105  10  0.001  0.01  0.1  1  10  100 k  Fig. 4. Primordial power spectrum for tensor modes in the deformed-algebra approach  from [21] . The exponential increase is not necessarily a problem as  i  the observational window might fall out of this region,  ii  the spectrum has anyway a natural cutoﬀ in the UV as the small-scale physics is not described by the primordial spectrum,  iii  backreaction should be taken into account when the amplitude becomes high. The spectrum for scalar modes was derived in [22].  Similar studies have been performed for the case of inverse volume  IV  correc- tions. This includes the derivation of an anomaly-free perturbation theory with IV corrections alone, and, with both holonomy and IV corrections [23]. How- ever, the impact of the IV corrections on the bounce itself is not well understood and the primordial power spectra with such corrections has been computed dur- ing inﬂation only. Fortunately, an imprint appears on the largest scales for scalar and tensor modes in the form of a polynomial boost below the pivot scale k0, P IV k  = P STD k ×  1 + Γδ0 k k0    [24]. Starting from such a predicted power spectrum, the IV parameters have been constrained using WMAP data on the CMB anisotropies showing that e.g. for σ = 2, the parameter δ0 is constrained to be smaller than 6.5 × 10  −5 at 95% of conﬁdence level [25].  −σ  3.3. Measuring the Barbero-Immirzi Parameter  The above results are based on loop quantum cosmology with a real-valued Barbero- Immirzi parameter, inherited from the standard formulation of loop quantum grav- ity. Originally, the Ashtekar formulation of gravity as a gauge theory was however built with a complex-valued Barbero-Immirzi parameter, γ = ±i, thus simplify- ing the constraints into being polynomials in the phase-space variables. Though γ plays no role at the classical level, it is of primary importance at the quantum level: γ = ±i makes the gauge group to be complex, rendering the quantization diﬃcult. Quantization is usually performed with γ ∈ R for the gauge group is SU  2 , which is directly related to the discreteness of the spectra of geometric operators. The role of γ is then crucial in LQC since the discreteness of geometric operators plays an important role in the bounce scenario via the minimal area gap. Phenomeno- logically speaking, the value of γ ﬁxes the value of ρc which could be measured by   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 294  294  A. Barrau & J. Grain  √ searching for the characteristic scale k cid:3  = 8πGρc in the CMB anisotropies. It was however argued that in the context of three-dimensional gravity, a natural choice would be γ = ±i which still leads to a consistent quantum theory [26]. This still has to be fully extended to four-dimensional gravity, but this shows that trying to experimentally probe the nature of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter is important.  The two  independent  helicity states of primordial gravitational waves are clas- sically derived from a linearization of Einstein’s equations around the inﬂationary background and subsequently quantized using a Fock scheme on curved spaces. The resulting primordial power spectra for the right-handed and left-handed gravitons  are equal, Pr l ∝  H MPl 2 with H the Hubble parameter during inﬂation  ‘gravi-   cid:5   ton’ is used to denote a Fock quantization of tensor modes . The CMB angular power spectrum of the BB correlation is sourced by the sum of the two helicity  temperature and B-modes  called T B , and between E- and B-modes  called EB   states  PT in equation  4  is the sum Pr + Pl . The cross-correlations between are however sourced by the diﬀerence of the two helicity states, Pr − Pl. Because Pr = Pl by linearizing Einstein’s equations and quantizing `a la Fock, C T B EB   are vanishing. However, it was argued that primordial gravitons may have a helicity- dependent behavior if linearization is performed in the Ashtekar formalism [27]. More precisely, it is argued that if the Barbero-Immirzi parameter is imaginary, the reality condition imposes that at the quantum level, left-handed and right-handed gravitons do not propagate similarly in an inﬂationary background, suggesting that linearized gravity may violate parity at the quantum level.  This helicity-dependent behavior only arises if γ has an imaginary part and at the quantum level. At the classical level or for a real-valued γ, there is no such parity breaking in linearized gravity.  If this is indeed the case, the T B and EB angular power spectra are non-zero if γ has a non-vanishing imaginary part while these spectra are zero if γ is real-valued. Some C T B  autocorrelation  are depicted in Figure 5, including lensing of CMB photons by large scale structures [28]. Dotted parts stand for negative values of T B and EB correlations which is an important piece of at  cid:9  ≤ 15 corresponds to more power in the information since e.g. a negative C T B right-handed gravitons. The amplitude of the BB autocorrelation is set by the value Pr−Pl Pr+Pl of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r  equal to 0.05 in Figure 5 . Introducing δ = which amounts to the level of parity violation in the linearized gravitational sector, the amplitude of the T B and EB correlations is set by  r×δ . A reconstruction of r and δ is then possible from a measurement of C BB , C T B . The parameter δ is a direct measure of the level of parity breaking, and subsequently a direct test  δ for the of a possible non-vanishing imaginary part of γ, as γ = simpliﬁed case of a purely imaginary Barbero-Immirzi parameter.   with the C BB  1 ± √  1 − δ2  and C EB  and CEB   cid:7    cid:6    cid:5    cid:5    cid:5    cid:5    cid:5    cid:5    cid:5   For a future, highly-sensitive satellite mission dedicated to the CMB polariza- tion, the measurements of polarized B-modes would be accurate enough for detect- ing at least 50% of parity violation at e.g. 95% of Conﬁdence Level  C.L.  for r = 0.2   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 295  Loop Quantum Gravity and Observations  295  Fig. 5.

Similarly, measuring C T B EB  consistent with zero would lead to an upper bound on δ, directly trans- lated into an exclusion range for γ. For r = 0.05, the exclusion range at 95% C.L. is 0.66 ≤ γ ≤ 1.5, and it is enlarged to 0.2 ≤ γ ≤ 4.9 for r = 0.2 [28].  4. Lorentz Invariance Violation  Testing for quantum gravity usually assumes an access to gravitational phenomena for which the curvature becomes close to the Planck scale. In Ref. [29], it was ﬁrst argued that one can also search for quantum gravity imprints by studying the propagation of particles whose energy is comparable to the quantum gravity energy scale  or even much below if the propagation distance is high enough . The basic idea is that discreteness is a genuine property of the quantum space-time. In the context of LQG, this can be understood from the discreteness of geometric operators as volume and area operators. This granularity ﬁxes an invariant length scale in apparent contradiction with special relativity  as a boost can contract any length scale . Even though arguments showing that the discreteness of geometric operators in agreement with Lorentz invariance have been put forward  see [30], which argues that the discrete spectrum is observer invariant but the expectation values are not , this granularity idea has opened a wide area of quantum gravity phenomenology aiming at searching for Lorentz invariance violation or deformation as a tracer of quantum gravity. This rich phenomenology is encoded in the fact that  the energy-momentum dispersion relation is modiﬁed E  cid:6  p+m2 2p±ξ E2 MQG n, with MQG the energy scale of quantum gravity, ξ > 0, and n usually chosen as an integer. Because of that, the group velocity for e.g. photons becomes momentum dependent. This means that two photons emitted at the same time but at diﬀerent   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 296  296  A. Barrau & J. Grain  momenta would be received at two diﬀerent times by a distant observer, as,  for  n = 1 , Δv  cid:6  ξΔkD MQG with Δk the momentum diﬀerence and D the distance  from the emitter to the receiver. One should therefore look for energetic phenomena  thus Δk is close enough to the quantum gravity scale  and cosmological distances  for having a cumulative impact  for such an eﬀect to be detectable.  If Lorentz invariance is indeed broken or deformed by quantum gravity, this could be described at an eﬀective level. There are many diﬀerent ways of implementing this idea, ranging from non-commutative space-time to eﬀective ﬁeld theories and nonlinear Poincar´e symmetries. Here, we only mention a few which are closely related to LQG and refer the interested reader to [31] and references therein for de- tails. In all the implementations discussed here, one arrives at a modiﬁed dispersion similar to the one mentioned above, with a potentially additional helicity depen- dence. One approach consists in analyzing the Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in a semi-classical state being an discrete approximation of the ﬂat geometry, dubbed a weave [32]. Because the densitized triad operator enters the Hamiltonian for electromagnetism, its expectation value on the weave state is expected to re- ceive loop quantum gravity corrections. The resulting modiﬁed dispersion relation for photons acquires a helicity-dependent correction ω2± = k2 ∓ 4χk3 MP l with χ ∼ 1. In such a case, photons would experience birefringence in vacuum modifying their polarization state. This eﬀect has been investigated  albeit in the framework of eﬀective ﬁeld theory  in [33] and [34].  Σ  Another approach was put forward in [35]. The idea is that, classically, the action S[A] can be used to deﬁne a slicing of the space-time. If one functional S[A] = now considers a quantum setting, this slicing ﬂuctuates around the classical neigh- borhood corresponding to space-time variations. The explicit calculation performed in [35] considers a Born-Oppenheimer state Ψ0[A]χ[A, φ] with Ψ0 a semiclassical state peaking at the classical solution and φ a matter ﬁeld. The expectation value of the densitized triad on such a semiclassical state, evaluated around the classical trajectory, is deformed to E 0  a i  x, t  the classical solution and ω to be interpreted as the energy of the matter ﬁeld  in the sense that χ[t, φ] ∝ e −iωtχω[φ] . The time parameter t is deﬁned from the action functional S[A]. Since the triad is now ω-dependent, this deﬁnes an ω-dependent metric and thus a modiﬁed dispersion relation: m2 = ω2 − k2  1 − αLP lω . A pos-  i  x, t  1 − αLP lω  with E 0  a  i  x, t, ω  = E 0  a  sible interpretation is that quantum gravity ﬂuctuations lead to an eﬀective frame in which momenta are measured [37]. Classically, the physical momenta pa is mea- sured in a local inertial frame ﬁxed by the space-time manifold, pa = eμ aπμ with πμ interpreted as the generator of translations. Quantum ﬂuctuations of the space- time itself would then lead to an eﬀective frame ˜eμ a which is nonlinearly related to eμ a with a πμ dependence, ˜eμ a, πμ . Since the physical momenta are now measured by ˜pa = ˜eμ aπμ, the transformation law for momenta would not be given anymore by the Lorentz matrices. In that case, one is therefore considering a de- formation of the Poincar´e symmetry since the relativity principle is preserved but the transformation rules are now nonlinear [36].  a = F  eμ      February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 297  Loop Quantum Gravity and Observations  297  5. Black Holes  Black holes have been extensively studied in loop quantum gravity  see Chapter 7 . As their macroscopic structure hopefully coincides  up to very small corrections  with the one predicted by general relativity, it is very hard to test LQG observation- ally using black holes. Recovering the correct value of the entropy is a very powerful consistency test but can hardly be considered as an experimental conﬁrmation. The only way to observationally investigate LQG with black holes would probably be through their Hawking evaporation. As no evaporating black hole has been seen up to now, this is a possibility of future. However, a wide variety of phenomena, reviewed in [38], can in principle lead to primordial black holes.  The idea proposed in [39] is to search for possible LQG signatures in the spec- trum of evaporating black holes. The state counting for black holes in LQG relies on the isolated horizon framework  that is a boundary of the underlying manifold con- sidered before quantization . For a given area A of a black hole horizon, the states arise from a punctured sphere whose punctures carry quantum labels  see, e.g., [40] . Two labels  j, m  are assigned to each puncture, j being a spin half-integer with in- formation on the area and m being its associated projection with information on the curvature. They satisfy the condition A − Δ ≤ 8πγ cid:9 2 ! where γ is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter of LQG, Δ is a ‘smearing’ parameter and p labels the diﬀerent punctures. One may also add the closure constraint:  jp jp + 1  ≤ A + Δ,  !   cid:2   p mp = 0, which corresponds to a horizon with spherical topology. In the past, it was postulated that due to quantum gravitational eﬀects, the change in the area of a black hole should be proportional to a fundamental area, of the order of  cid:9 2 Pl. It was then hoped that associated lines in the evaporation spectrum should appear and might reveal quantum gravity eﬀects. However it was understood in [41, 42] that the situation is diﬀerent in LQG because the spacing of the energy levels decreases exponentially with the energy. In [39], this issue was readdressed and it was shown that several diﬀerent signatures can in fact be expected.  N p=1  P  To investigate the evaporation in the deep quantum regime, a dedicated and optimized algorithm was developed. It is based on [43] and improved by a breadth- ﬁrst search. To see if there is a measurable diﬀerence, the evaporation has been considered both according to the pure Hawking law and according to LQG. In each case, it was modeled by expressing the probability of transition between states as the exponential of the entropy diﬀerence modulated by the greybody factor. Those factors were computed beyond the optical limit by solving the quantum wave equations in the curved background of the black hole. Figure 6 shows that some speciﬁc lines associated with transitions occurring during the last stages of the evaporation can be identiﬁed in the LQG spectrum whereas the pure Hawking spectrum is naturally featureless.  Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the energy resolution and the number of black holes required for distinguishing between the diﬀerent scenar- ios. At each step of the evaporation process, the energy of the emitted quantum was   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 298  298  A. Barrau & J.

For a detector located close to the black hole, and due to the huge Lorentz factors, the electrons, muons and taus can be consid- ered as stable.  There is another speciﬁc feature of the end-point of the evaporation process which can also be considered. In LQG, the last transitions take place at deﬁnite discrete energies associated with the ﬁnal peaks in the mass spectrum whereas in the usual Hawking picture, the simplest way to implement a minimal mass is to perform a truncation of the standard spectrum to ensure energy conservation. This leads to the consequence that in the standard picture, the energy of the emitted quanta will progressively decrease and asymptotically approach to zero. This ‘low-energy’ emission associated with the end-point can be distinguished from the ‘low-energy’ particles emitted earlier in the evaporation process thanks to the dynamics. The time interval between consecutive emissions will increase with decreasing energies −3. At 100 TeV, the mean interval is around 1 s. This speciﬁc feature of as E the “standard” spectrum is very diﬀerent from the absence of low-energy particles expected in the LQG case.

Grain  A ﬁnal possible test is associated with the pseudo-periodic ‘large scale’ structure of the area spectrum  see [43] and references therein . Most recent arguments suggest that this periodicity is damped for high masses. If, however, it was to remain, this would lead to interesting features. The area gap dA between peaks can be shown to be independent of the scale. As, for a Schwarzschild black hole, dA = 32πM dM and T = 1  8πM  , this straightforwardly leads to dM T = const where dM refers to the mass gap between peaks. This is the important point for detection: in units of temperature, the mass gap does not decrease for increasing masses. Any observable feature associated with this pseudoperiodicity can therefore be searched for through larger black holes. If primordial black holes are formed with a deﬁnite mass  as expected for example from phase transitions  and not with a continuous spectrum, their resulting emission can be shown [39] to exhibit potentially detectable features associated with this pseudo-periodicity.  A new proposal about statistics, holography, and black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity was suggested in [44]. The main change is that the degeneracy of area eigenvalues of LQG is now modiﬁed in a simple way by taking into account vac- uum ﬂuctuations in the near horizon region. The area spectrum will not be modiﬁed but instead of having basically a degeneracy of 2j + 1 for each puncture state, we would now have eaj  4  where aj is the area eigenvalue, that is 8πγ cid:9 2 j j + 1  . Im- p portantly, punctures should in this case be considered as indistinguishable bosons. The very same Monte Carlo simulation approach is being performed to account also for this new model.   cid:2   6. Planck Stars  Recently another idea about black holes and possible observational consequences was pushed in [45]. The key insight comes ﬁrst from lessons from quantum cos- mology. In loop cosmology, the Friedmann equation is modiﬁed by quantum grav- itational eﬀects by a term determined by the ratio of ρ to a Planck scale density ρP l. The quantum gravity regime seems to be reached when the energy density of matter reaches the Planck scale, ρ ∼ ρP l. The point is that this may happen well before relevant lengths l become Planckian. The bounce is due to a quantum- gravitational repulsion which originates from the Heisenberg uncertainty and does not happen when the universe is of Planckian size but instead happens when the energy density reaches the Planck density. Quantum gravity could become relevant when the volume of the universe is some 75 orders of magnitude larger than the Planck volume [46].  The analogy between quantum gravitational eﬀects on cosmological and black- hole singularities has been successfully used to make a proposal as to how quantum gravity could also resolve the singularity at the center of a collapsed star. It is assumed that the energy of a collapsing star and any energy falling into the hole could condense into a highly compressed core with density of the order of the Planck density. If this is the case, the gravitational collapse of a star does not lead to a   February 21, 2017 16:13  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 301  Loop Quantum Gravity and Observations  301  m   cid:3    cid:4 n  singularity but to an additional phase in the life of a star: a quantum gravitational phase where the gravitational attraction is balanced by a quantum pressure. A star in this phase is called a ‘Planck star’. The key observation is that a Planck star can have a size r ∼ lP l where m is now the mass of the star and n is positive. For instance, if n = 1 3  as can be naively computed , a stellar-mass black hole −10 cm, that is 30 orders would collapse to a Planck star with a size of the order of 10 of magnitude larger than the Planck length. The main hypothesis is that a star so compressed would not satisfy the classical Einstein equations anymore, even if huge compared to the Planck scale, because its energy density is already Planckian.  mP l  The event horizon is replaced by a ‘trapping’ — or rather, ‘dynamical’ — hori- zon [47] which looks like the standard horizon locally, but from which matter can eventually bounce out. The core, that is the ‘Planck star’, retains memory of the initial collapsed mass mi. In particular, primordial black holes exploding today may produce a distinctive signal for this scenario. Let mf = ami be the ﬁnal mass reached by the black hole before the dissipation of the horizon. It was shown in [45], using arguments based on information conservation avoiding the ﬁrewall hypothesis, that the preferred value is a ∼ 1√ . The whole observational scenario relies on the assumption that when the black hole reaches this mass it releases all its energy.  2  During the evaporation phase, the mass loss rate is given by dm  m2 , where f  m  is given above each threshold by f  m  ≈  7.8αs=1 2 + 3.1αs=1  × 1024 g3s −1, where αs=1 2 and αs=1 are the number of degrees of freedom  including spin, charge and color  of the emitted particles. If f  m  is assumed to be constant, this leads to:  dt = − f  m    cid:24    cid:25  1  3  mi =  3tHf  mi  1 − a3  .   15   To account for the smooth evolution of f  m  a numerical integration can be carried  out and leads to mi ≈ 6.1 × 1014 g, and mf ≈ 4.3 × 1014 g. The value of mi is very close to the usual value m∗ corresponding to black holes needing a Hubble time to fully evaporate. This was expected as the process is explosive. The size of the black hole when it reaches mf is the only scale in the problem and therefore ﬁxes the energy of the emitted particles in this last stage. All quanta are assumed to be emitted with the same energy taken at Eburst = hc  2rf   ≈ 3.9 GeV.  Most of the emitted gammas are not emitted with the energy Eburst but, instead, come from the decay of hadrons produced in the jets of quarks. If one assumes that the branching ratios are controlled by the internal degrees of freedom, the direct emission represents only a small fraction  1 34 of the emitted particles . To simulate this process, the ‘Lund Monte Carlo’ PYTHIA code was used to generate the mean spectrum expected for secondary gamma-rays emitted by a Planck star reaching the end of its life. The main point worth noticing is that the mean energy is of  the order of 0.03 × Eburst, that is in the tens of MeV range rather than in the GeV  range, with a high multiplicity of 10 photons per q ¯q jet.

Full spectrum of gamma-rays emitted by a decaying Planck star  log scales   from [48] .  It is straightforward to estimate the number of photons   emitted during the burst. As for a black hole radiating by the Hawking mechanism, the particles emitted during the bursts  that is those with m < Eburst  are emitted proportionally to their number of internal degrees of freedom: gravity is democratic. The spectrum resulting from the emitted u, d, c, s quarks  t and b are too heavy , gluons and photons is shown in Figure 8. The little peak on the right corresponds to directly emitted photons that are clearly sub-dominant. By also taking into account the emission of neutrinos and leptons of all three families  leading to virtually no gamma-rays and therefore being here a pure missing energy , one obtains a total  number of photons emitted of  ≈ 4.7 × 1038. If one assumes a 1 m2 detector, this leads to a maximum distance of detectability of R ≈ 205 light-years. The ‘single event’ detection of exploding Planck stars is therefore local and only a tiny galactic patch around us can be probed. The signal is therefore expected to be isotropic.  If Planck stars reaching mf were to saturate the dark matter bound their number  within this detectable horizon would be   cid:2    cid:3  3 2 ≈ 3.8 × 1022.  N max  det =  4πρDM∗  3mf  S    4πNmes   16   −8 for initial However the usual constraint on primordial black holes ΩP BH < 10 masses around 1015 g basically holds and this leads to Ndet < 3.8 × 1014, which is  still a high number showing that the individual detection is not impossible.  It is possible to estimate the number of events observable in a time Δt corre- sponding to Planck stars that have masses between mf and m Δt  at the beginning of the observation time, within the volume R < Rdet. In this case, m Δt  is sim-   cid:4   ply: m Δt  =  m3  f + 3f  m Δt  . The number of expected ‘events’ during Δt is   cid:5  1  3   February 22, 2017 10:18  ws-rv961x669  BC: 10445 - Loop Quantum Gravity  book page 303  Loop Quantum Gravity and Observations  303  given by   cid:82  m ∆t   cid:82  mmax  mf  mf  dn dm dm dn dm dm  N  ∆t  =  ΩP BH N max  det Ωsr,   17   where mmax is the maximum mass up to which we assume the mass spectrum dn dm to be ‘ﬁlled’ by black holes and Ωsr is the solid angle acceptance of the considered detector. An upper limit on the value of ΩP BH can be taken conservatively at 10−8. If one sets mmax = m∗ and a density of a few percents of the maximum allowed density, that is ΩP BH ∼ 10−10, this leads to one event per day. Could such events be associated with some gamma-ray bursts  GRBs  already detected? The long GRBs are well understood and have no link with Planck stars. Were Planck star explosions to be associated with some of the known GRBs, this would be with short gamma-ray bursts  SGRBs . Interestingly, SGRBs are the less well understood; the redshifts are not measured for a large fraction of them; they are known to have a harder spectrum and some of them do indeed reach the energies estimated here; and a sub-class of SGRB, the very short gamma ray bursts  VSGRBs , do exhibit an even harder spectrum and can be assumed to originate from a diﬀerent mechanism as the SGRB time distribution seems to be bimodal. This does not mean that exploding Planck stars have been detected but this raises an interesting question.  Recently, the model has been developed in [49] and the resulting phenomenology  was investigated in [50] and [51].  References  arXiv:1403.3985.

This volume presents a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in loop quantum gravity from the perspective of younger leading researchers. It takes the reader from the basics to recent advances, thereby bridging an important gap. The aim is two-fold to provide a contemporary introduction to the entire field for students and post-docs, and to present an overview of the current status for more senior researchers. The contributions include the latest developments that are not discussed in existing books, particularly recent advances in quantum dynamics both in the Hamiltonian and sum over histrories approaches; and applications to cosmology of the early universe and to the quantum aspects of black holes.
