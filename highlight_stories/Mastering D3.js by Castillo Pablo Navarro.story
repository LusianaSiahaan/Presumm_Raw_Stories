On its website, there are hundreds of beautiful examples,  visualizations, and charts created mainly with D3. Looking at the examples, we  soon realize that D3 allows us to create an uncanny variety of visuals. We can find  everything from simple bar charts to interactive maps.  The ability to create almost anything with D3 comes at a price; we must think  about our charts at a more abstract level and learn how to bind data elements with  elements in our page. This association between properties of our data items and  visual attributes of the elements in our chart will allow us to create complex charts  and visualizations.  In real-life projects, we will have to integrate components and charts created with  D3 with other components and libraries. In most of the examples in this book, we  will cover how to integrate D3 with other libraries and tools, creating complete  applications that leverage the best of each library.  Through the examples of this book, we will cover reusable charts using external data  sources, thereby creating user interface elements and interactive maps with D3. At  the end, we will implement an application to visualize topics mentioned on Twitter   in real time.  D3 is a great tool to experiment with visuals and data. I hope you will have fun  following the examples in this book and creating your own visualizations.  What this book covers  Chapter 1, Data Visualization, provides us with examples of interesting visualization  projects and references that help us learn more about data visualization. We also  review some examples of historical relevance and discuss what makes D3 a good   tool to create data-visualization projects.   Chapter 2, Reusable Charts, focuses on how to create configurable charts that can  be used in several projects. In this chapter, we discuss how to use selections to  manipulate elements in a web page and use this to create a reusable barcode chart  from scratch. We also create a custom layout algorithm and use it to create a radial  bar chart. Chapter 3, Creating Visualizations without SVG, discusses the current state of SVG  support in the browser market and provides some strategies to create visualizations  that work in browsers that don't have SVG support. We create an animated bubble  chart using div elements, learn how to detect whether the browser supports SVG,  and use polyfills to render SVG figures using the HTML5 canvas element. We also  learn how to create visualizations using D3 and canvas. Chapter 4, Creating a Color Picker with D3, introduces concepts that allow us to create  user interaction elements and controls. In this chapter, we use the D3 drag behavior  and the reusable chart pattern to create a slider control. We use this control to create  a color picker based on the CIE Lab color model, which is also a reusable chart. Chapter 5, Creating User Interface Elements, discusses how to use event listeners   to highlight elements in a chart. We also discuss how to create tooltips and how   to integrate these tooltips with existing charts. We create an area chart and use the  brush behavior to select a range in the chart. Chapter 6, Interaction between Charts, discusses how to use Backbone to create  structured web applications, separating data from its visual representation, and how  to integrate D3 charts in this architecture. We will learn how to implement models,  views, collections, and routes in order to keep a consistent application state. We will  use this to create an application to explore the time series of stock prices using the  area chart implemented in Chapter 5, Creating User Interface Elements. Chapter 7, Creating a Charting Package, introduces the development workflow to create  a charting package using D3. We introduce tools and best practices to implement,  organize, and distribute the package. We will also create a sample project that uses  the charting package as an external dependency. Chapter 8, Data-driven Applications, provides us with an example of a web application  and introduces tools to deploy visualization projects. We create an application that  uses the World Bank data API to create a visualization of the evolution of indicators  of human development. We will learn how to use GitHub pages to host our project  and how to host a static website using Amazon S3. Chapter 9, Creating a Dashboard, introduces concepts and best practices to create  dashboards. We implement an example dashboard to monitor the performance   of students in a class using D3 and custom charts.  [ 2 ]   Chapter 10, Creating Maps, discusses how to create vector maps using the geographic  functions of D3. We will learn how to obtain geographic data and how to convert it  to GeoJSON and TopoJSON formats, which are more suitable to be used with D3.  We will create a choropleth map with D3 and use the TopoJSON library to visualize  neighbors and boundaries between countries. We will also learn how to create a  custom D3 layer to be used with Mapbox. Chapter 11, Creating Advanced Maps, introduces some geographic projections and  discusses how to configure projections to center and scale maps at specific locations. We  also use the Orthographic projection to create a rotating globe. We also use a star catalog  and the Stereographic projection to create a fullscreen star map. We will also learn how  to use canvas to project raster images from Earth using the Orthographic projection. Chapter 12, Creating a Real-time Application, introduces the concepts and tools that are  used to create real-time applications. We will learn how to use Firebase to update  the state of our applications in real time. We will also create a real-time application  to explore the geographic distribution of geotagged tweets that match user-defined  topics using Node, Socket.IO, and D3.  What you need for this book  The code bundle of this book was created using Jekyll, which is a static website  generator. To run most of the examples in the code bundle, you will need a   static web server and a modern web browser. The following list summarizes   the main dependencies:     A modern web browser    D3 3.4       Text editor  Jekyll or other static web servers  Some chapters require you to install additional frontend libraries, such as Backbone,  TopoJSON, Typeahead, and Bootstrap. Additional instructions on installing these  libraries can be found in the corresponding chapters. In other chapters, we will use  additional software to compile assets or process files. In those cases, installing the  software is optional  the compiled files will be present as well , but it might be useful  for you to install them for your own projects:     Node and Node packages    Git    Make    TopoJSON    GDAL  [ 3 ]   Instructions to install these applications can also be found in the corresponding chapters.  Who this book is for  This book is for frontend programmers who want to learn how to create charts,  visualizations, and interactive maps with D3. We will cover everything from   creating basic charts to complex real-time applications, integrating other   libraries and components to create real-life applications. We assume that you know the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but we  review the main concepts as needed.  Conventions  In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different  kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of  their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions,  pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "In the example file, we have a div element classed as chart-example and with the   ID chart." A block of code is set as follows:  When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the  relevant lines or items are set in bold:  divItems.enter       .append 'div'      .attr 'class', 'data-item' ;  chart.onClick = function d  {        ...         Invoke the user callback.     onColorChange color ; };  Any command-line input or output is written as follows: $ grunt vows  Running "vows:all"  vows  task   additional output not shown   Done, without errors.  [ 4 ]   New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the  screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text as follows: "By clicking on Create a Project, we can access the map editor, where we can  customize the colors of land, buildings, and other features; select the base layer   street, terrain, or satellite  and select the primary language for the features and  locations in the map."  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  Reader feedback  Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

[ 6 ]   Data Visualization  Humans began to record things long before writing systems were created. When the  number and diversity of things to remember outgrew the capacity of human memory,  we began to use external devices to register quantitative information. Clay tokens  were used as early as 8000-7500 BC to represent commodities like measures of wheat,  livestock, and even units of man labor. These objects were handy to perform operations  that would have been difficult to do with the real-life counterparts of the tokens;  distribution and allocation of goods became easier to perform. With time, the tokens  became increasingly complex, and soon, the limitations of the complex token system  were identified and the system began to be replaced with simpler yet more abstract  representations of quantities, thereby originating the earlier systems of writing.  Keeping records has always had a strong economic and practical drive. Having  precise accounts of grains and pastures for the livestock allowed people to plan  rations for the winter, and knowing about seasons and climate cycles allowed people  to determine when to plant and when to harvest. As we became better at counting  and registering quantitative information, trading with other nations and managing  larger administrative units became possible, thereby providing us with access to  goods and knowledge from other latitudes. We keep records because we think it's  useful. Knowing what we have allows us to better distribute our assets, and knowing  the past allows us to prepare for the future.  Today, we register and store more data than ever. Imagine that you want to go   out for a morning cup of coffee. If you pay in cash, the date, price of the coffee, and  the kind of coffee will be recorded before your coffee was actually prepared. These  records will feed the accounting and stock systems of the store, being aggregated  and transformed to financial statements, staff performance reports, and taxes to  be paid by the store. Paying with credit card will generate a cascade of records in  the accounting system of your bank. We measure things hoping that having the  information will help us to make better decisions and to improve in the future.   History demonstrates that gathering and understanding data can help to solve relevant  problems. An example of this is the famous report of John Snow about the Broad Street  cholera outbreak. On August 31, 1854, a major outbreak of cholera was declared in  the Soho district of London. Three days later, 127 people died from the disease. At the  time, the mechanism of transmission of the cholera was not understood. The germ  theory was yet to exist, and the mainstream theory was that the disease spread by a  form of bad air. The physician, John Snow, began to investigate the case, collecting and  classifying facts, recording deaths and their circumstances as well as a great number of  testimonials. Refer to the following screenshot:  Details of the original map made for Snow, displaying the deaths by cholera in the Soho district  [ 8 ]   He gave special attention to the exceptions in the map and noticed that neither   the workhouse inmates nor the brewery workers had been affected. The exceptions  became further proof as he discovered that about 70 employees who worked in   the brewery drank only beer made with water from a pump inside the walls of   the brewery. In the workhouse, which also had its own water pump, only 5 out of  500 died, and further investigation revealed that the deceased were admitted when  the outbreak had already begun. Although the map is convincing enough, Snow's  original report contains more than 150 pages filled with tables and testimonials that  support or raise questions about his theory. The local council decided to disable the  pump by removing its handle, when the outbreak had already began to decline.  The report from John Snow is a great triumph of detective work and data visualization.  He gathered information about the deaths and their circumstances and displayed  them as data points in their geographic context, which made the pattern behind the  causalities visible. He didn't stop at studying the data points; he also investigated  the absence of the disease in certain places, faced the exceptions instead of quietly  dismissing them, and eventually formed stronger evidence to support his case.  In this chapter, we will discuss what makes visual information so effective and  discuss what data visualization is. We will comment about the different kinds   of data visualization works, which gives a list of references to learn more about it.   We will also discuss D3 and its differences with other tools to create visualizations.  Defining data visualization  Our brains are specially adapted to gather and analyze visual information. Images are  easier to understand and recall. We tend to analyze and detect patterns in what we see  even when we are not paying attention. The relation between visual perception and  cognition can be used to our advantage if we can provide information that we want to  communicate in a visual form.  [ 9 ]   Data visualization is the discipline that studies how to use visual perception to  communicate and analyze data. Being a relatively young discipline, there are several  working definitions of data visualization. One of the most accepted definitions states:  "Data visualization is the representation and presentation of data that exploits our  visual perception in order to amplify cognition."  The preceding quote is taken from Data Visualization: A successful design process,   Andy Kirk, Packt Publishing. There are several variants for this definition, but the essence remains the same—data  visualization is a visual representation of data that aims to help us better understand  the data and its relevant context. The capacity for visual processing of our brains can  also play against us. Data visualization made without proper care can misrepresent  the underlying data and fail to communicate the truth, or worse, succeed in  communicating lies.  The kind of works that fall under this definition are also diverse; infographics,  exploratory tools, and dashboards are data visualization subsets. In the next   section, we will describe them and give some notable examples of each one.  Some kinds of data visualizations There are countless ways to say things, and there are even more ways to  communicate using visual means. We can create visualizations for the screen or  for printed media, display the data in traditional charts, or try something new. The  choice of colors alone can be overwhelming. When creating a project, a great number  of decisions have to be made, and the emphasis given by the author to the different  aspects of the visualization will have a great impact on the visual output.  [ 10 ]   Among this diversity, there are some forms that are recognizable. Infographics are  usually suited with a great deal of contextual information. Projects more inclined to  exploratory data analysis will tend to be more interactive and provide less guidance.  Of course, this classification is only to provide reference points; the data visualization  landscape is a continuum between infographics, exploratory tools, charts, and data  art. Charles Minard's chart, which shows the number of men in Napoleon's 1812  Russian campaign, is shown in the following screenshot:  Charles Minard's flow map of Napoleon's march  It would be difficult to classify Charles Minard's figure as an infographic or as  a flow chart because it allows for both. The information displayed is primarily  quantitative, but it's shown in a map with contextual information that allows us to  better understand the decline in the Napoleonic forces. There are several dimensions  being displayed at once such as the number of soldiers, the geographic location of  the soldiers during the march, and the temperature at each place. The figure does  amazing work by showing how diminished the forces were when they arrived at  Moscow and how the main enemy was the cold winter.  [ 11 ]   Infographics Infographics is a form of data visualization that is focused on communicating and  explaining one or more particular views of a subject. It usually contains images,  charts, and annotations, which provides context and enhances the reader's capacity to  understand the main display of information. The award-winning infography about  the right whale  La ballena Franca in original Spanish , created by Jaime Serra and  published in the Argentinian newspaper, Clarin, in 1995 is a great example of how  infographics can be a powerful tool to enlighten and communicate a particular subject.  This can be found at http:  3.bp.blogspot.com _LCqDL30ndZQ TBPkvZIQaNI  AAAAAAAAAik OrjA6TShNsk s1600 INFO-BALLENA.jpg. A huge painting of the right  whale covers most of the infography area. A small map shows where this species can  be found during their migratory cycles. There are outlines of the right whale alongside  other kinds of whales, comparing their sizes. The image of the whale is surrounded by  annotations about their anatomy that explain how they swim and breathe. Bar charts  display the dramatic decline in their population and how they are recovering at least in  some corners of the globe. All these elements are integrated in a tasteful and beautiful  display that accomplishes its purpose, which is to display data to inform the reader.  The Right Whale, Jaime Serra, 1995, can be seen in the following image:  The Right Whale by Jaime Sierra  There are people who don't consider infographics as proper data visualization  because they are designed to guide the reader through a story with the main facts  already highlighted, as opposed to a chart-based data visualization where the story  and the important facts are to be discovered by the reader.  [ 12 ]   Exploratory visualizations This branch of data visualization is more focused on providing tools to explore and  interpret datasets. These visualizations can be static or interactive. The exploration  can be either looking at the charts carefully or to interact with the visualization to  discover interesting things. In interactive projects, the user is allowed to filter and  interact with the visualizations to discover interesting patterns and facts with little  or no guidance. This kind of project is usually regarded as being more objective and  data centered than other forms. A great example is The Wealth and Health of Nations, from the Gapminder project   http:  www.gapminder.org world . The Gapminder World tool helps us explore  the evolution of life in different parts of the world in the last two centuries. The  visualization is mainly composed of a configurable bubble chart. The user can select  indicators such as life expectancy, fertility rates, and even consumption of sugar per  capita and see how different countries have evolved in regard to these indicators.  One of the most interesting setups is to select life expectancy in the y axis, income per  person in the x axis, and the size of the bubbles as the size of the population of each  country. The bubbles will begin to animate as the years pass, bouncing and making  loops as the life expectancy in each country changes. If you explore your own country,  you will soon realize that some of the backward movements are related to economic  crisis or political problems and how some countries that were formerly similar in their  trends in these dimensions diverge. A visualization from Gapminder World, powered  by Trendalyzer from www.gapminder.org, is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 13 ]   The time series for dozens of variables allow the user to explore this dataset, uncover  stories, and learn very quickly about how countries that are similar in some regards  can be very different in other aspects. The aim of the Gapminder project is to help  users and policy makers to have a fact-based view of the world, and the visualization  certainly succeeds in providing the means to better understand the world.  Dashboards Dashboards are dense displays of charts that help us to understand the key metrics  of an issue as quickly and effectively as possible. Business intelligence dashboards  and website users' behavior are usually displayed as dashboards. Stephen Few  defines an information dashboard as follows:  "A visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more  objectives; consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be  monitored at a glance."  The preceding quote can be found in Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual  Communication of Data, Stephen Few, O'Reilly Media.  As the information has to be delivered quickly, there is no time to read long  annotations or to click controls; the information should be visible, ready to be  consumed. Dashboards are usually bundled with complementary information  systems to further investigate issues if they are detected. The distribution of the space  in a dashboard is the main challenge when designing them. Compact charts will be  preferred in this kind of project, as long as they still allow for speedy decoding of  the information. We will learn about designing dashboards in Chapter 9, Creating a  Dashboard. An example dashboard from Chapter 9, Creating a Dashboard, showing the  performance of students in a class can be seen in the following screenshot:  [ 14 ]   This classification mentions only some of the forms of data visualization projects;  most parts of data visualizations won't fit exactly under these labels. There is plenty  of room to experiment with new formats and borrow elements of infographics,  dashboards, and traditional charts to communicate more effectively.  Learning about data visualization Despite being a young discipline, there are great books on data visualization  and information design. A successful data visualization practitioner should also  know about design, statistics, cognition, and visual perception, but reading data  visualization books is a good start.  Edward Tufte is an expert in information design and his works are a must-read in  this field. They are filled with good and bad examples of information design and  comments about how to better communicate quantitative information. They contain  collections of images from ancient charts and visualizations, which explain their  historic context and the impact they had. The discussion is not restricted to how to  communicate quantitative information; there are examples ranging from natural  history to architecture:     Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative, Edward R.

He recently published a  book sharing his experiences in creating data visualizations. He gives guidelines to  plan and make the creation of visualizations more systematic. The book is filled with  actionable advice about how to design and plan our visualization projects. Andy's  blog  http:  www.visualisingdata.com  is a great source to be informed about the  latest developments in the field:     Data Visualization: A Successful Design Process, Andy Kirk, Packt Publishing  There isn't a universal recipe to create good data visualizations, but the experience  and guidelines from experts in the field can help us to avoid mistakes and create  better visualizations. It will take time to have the necessary skills to create great  data visualizations, but learning from experienced people will help us make a safer  journey. As with many other things in life, the key to learning is to practice, get  feedback, and improve over time.  Introducing the D3 library  In 2011, I was working in a hedge fund, and most of my work consisted of processing  and analyzing market data. It mostly consisted of time series, each row containing  a timestamp and two prices: the bid and asking prices for stock options. I had to  assess the quality of two years of market data and find whether there were errors  or gaps between millions of records. The time series were not uniform; there can be  hundreds of records in a couple of seconds or just a few records in an hour. I decided  to create a bar chart that shows how many records there were in each hour for the  two years of data. I created a Python script using the excellent packages NumPy and  Matplotlib. The result was a folder with thousands of useless bar charts. Of course,  the software was not to blame.  In my second attempt, I tried to create a heat map, where the columns represented  hours in a week and the rows represented the weeks of a year. The color of each cell  was proportional to the number of quotes in that hour. After tweaking the colors and  the size of the cells, my first visualization emerged. Success! The pattern emerged.  My coworkers began to gather around, recognizing and explaining the variations  on market activity. The black columns at the end of the chart corresponded to  weekends, when the market was closed. Mondays were brighter and had more  activity than other days. Holidays were easy to spot after a quick consult to the  holidays calendar for the year. More interesting patterns were also discernible; there  was frantic activity at the beginning of the working day and a slight but noticeable  decline at lunch. It was fun and interesting to recognize what we already knew.  [ 16 ]   However, besides the gaps explained by common sense, there were small gaps that  couldn't be explained with holidays or hungry stock traders. There were hours with  little or no activity; in the context of a year of market activity, we could see that it  was something unusual. A simple heat map allowed us to find the gaps and begin to  investigate the anomalies.  Of course, this first heat map required a better version, one that could allow the  exploring of the dataset more easily. We needed an interactive version to know the  exact date and time of the gaps and how many records there were in each hourly  block. It should also highlight the weekends and holidays. This required better tools,  something that allows for more interaction and that doesn't require Python's virtual  environments and numerous packages to generate the graphics. This search led me  to D3, and I began to learn.  There are several charting packages for web platforms, but D3 excels among   them by its flexibility and strong features. A quick visit to the D3 home page   http:  www.d3js.org  will amaze us with hundreds of examples of what   can be done, from the humble bar chart to beautifully crafted interactive maps.  Newcomers will soon realize that D3 is not a charting package, but is a tool to   bind data items with DOM elements and associate data attributes with visual  properties of the DOM elements. This could sound abstract, but this is all we   need to create almost any chart.  A chart is a visual representation of a dataset. To create a chart, we must associate  attributes of the data items with properties of graphic objects. Let's consider the  following dataset:  x 2.358820 2.351551 ... 3.581900  y 0.70524774 0.71038206 ... -0.426217726  [ 17 ]   This series of numbers doesn't have an intrinsic visual representation; we should  encode the attributes of each record and assign them corresponding visual attributes.  Using the most traditional representation for this kind of data, we can represent the  rows as dots on a surface. The position of the dots will be determined by their x and  y attributes. Their horizontal position will be proportional to the x attribute and their  vertical position will be proportional to the y attribute. This will generate the following  scatter plot:  Scatter plot, a visual representation of two-dimensional quantitative data  To help the viewer trace back from position to data attributes, we can add axes,  which are essentially annotations for the visual representation of the data. All charts  work on the same principle, which is associate visual attributes to data attributes.  With D3, we can manipulate attributes of DOM elements based on attributes  of the data items. This is the essence of creating charts. SVG stands for Scalable  Vector Graphics, and in most browsers, SVG images can be included in the page  and thereby become a part of the DOM. In most cases, we will use svg elements to  create charts and other graphic elements. SVG allows us to create basic shapes as  rectangles, circles, and lines as well as more complex elements as polygons and text.  We can color the elements by assigning them classes and adding CSS styles to the  page, or we can use the fill attribute of svg objects. D3 and SVG form a powerful  combination, which we will use to create interactive charts and maps.  [ 18 ]   Of course, there is a price to pay to effectively use these powerful tools. We must learn  and understand how browsers work and know our way with JavaScript, CSS, and  HTML. One of the fundamentals of D3 is that it manipulates DOM elements, knowing  little or nothing about the visual representation of the elements. If we want to create  a circle, D3 doesn't provide a createCircle x, y, radius  function, but rather we  should append a circle svg element in a DOM node  the element with the container  ID  and set their attributes:     Appending a circle element to a DOM node  d3.select 'container' .append 'circle'      .attr 'cx', 10      .attr 'cy', 10      .attr 'r', 10 ;  Downloading the example code You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have  purchased from your account at http:  www.packtpub.com. If you  purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit http:  www.packtpub. com support and register to have the files e-mailed directly to you.  As D3 doesn't know anything else other than the fact that we are appending a DOM  element, it is up to us to check whether the parent element is an svg element and that  cx, cy, and r are valid attributes for a circle.  As we mentioned before, D3 doesn't have ready-to-use charts, but has several tools to  make creating visualizations and charts easy. Binding data to DOM elements allows  us to create from bar charts to interactive maps by following similar patterns. We will  learn how to create reusable charts so that we don't have to code them each time we  want to add a chart to a page. For big projects, we will need to integrate our D3-based  charts with third-party libraries that support our need, which is out of the D3 scope.  We will also learn about how to use D3 in conjunction with external libraries.  Fortunately, D3 has a great community of developers. Mike Bostock, the creator of  D3, has created a nice collection of in-depth tutorials about the trickiest parts of D3  and examples demonstrating almost every feature. Users of the library have also  contributed with examples covering a wide range of applications.  [ 19 ]   Summary  In this chapter, we gave a working definition of data visualization, one of the main  fields of application of the D3 library.  This book is about D3 and how to create interactive data visualizations in real-life  settings. We will learn about the inner working of D3 and create well-structured  charts to be used and shared across projects. We will learn how to create complete  applications using D3 and third-party libraries and services as well as how to prepare  our development environment to have maintainable and comfortable workflows.  Learning D3 may take some time, but it's certainly rewarding. The following  chapters are focused on providing the tools to learn how to use D3 and other   tools to create beautiful charts that will add life to your data.  [ 20 ]   Reusable Charts  In this chapter, we will learn how to create configurable charts and layout algorithms  and how to use these components. One important characteristic of configurable  charts is that we can use them in different contexts without having to change the  code. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Learn how to create reusable charts    Create a reusable barcode chart    Create a reusable layout algorithm    Use the layout and the barcode chart  We will begin by defining what we understand by reusable charts and construct a  reusable chart from scratch.  Creating reusable charts  A chart is a visual representation of a dataset. As datasets grow in complexity and  number of elements, we might want to encapsulate the chart in a reusable piece of  code to share it and use it in other projects. The success of the reusability of the chart  depends on the choices made during the design process. We will follow the proposal given in  the article Towards Reusable Charts by Mike  Bostock with some modifications. Charts created with this model will have the  following attributes:     Configurable: The chart appearance and behavior can be modified without  having to change the code of the chart. The chart should expose an API that  allows customization.      Repeatable: A chart can be rendered in a selection that contains several   elements, displaying independent visualizations in each node. The update  process and the variables associated to the data items must be independent  as well.     Composable: A consequence of the previous attributes is that a chart can  have inner charts as long as the inner charts follow the same conventions.  We must evaluate which aspects of the chart must be configurable and which aspects  are fixed, because adding more flexibility increases the complexity of the chart.  There are other ways to implement reusability. For instance, the D3.Chart package  by the Miso Project proposes a model that allows extension of the charts in terms of  existing charts, add event-listening capabilities to the charts, and includes the mini  framework D3.layer that allows us to configure life cycle events without changing  the rendering logic of the chart.  We will begin by reviewing the creation and data-binding processes in D3 in order to  construct a reusable chart step by step.  Creating elements with D3 In this section, we will review the mechanism of creation and manipulation of  data-bound DOM elements using D3. To follow the examples in this section, open  the chapter02 01-creating-dom-elements.html file and open the browser's  Developer Tools.  We can use D3 to create and modify the elements in a web page. In the Developer  Tools Console, we can create a new paragraph at the end of the body with a single  command as follows:  > var p = d3.select 'body' .append 'p' ;  Inspecting the document structure, we can see that an empty paragraph element   was appended at the end of the body. The appended method returns a selection   that contains the new paragraph element. Refer to the following screenshot:  [ 22 ]   As we stored a reference to the paragraph selection in the p variable, we can use this  reference to modify the content of the paragraph as follows:  > p.html 'New paragraph.' ;  The text method will also return the paragraph selection, allowing us to use method  chaining to modify the paragraph font color as follows:  > p.html 'blue paragraph' .style 'color', 'blue' ;  The style method will once more return the paragraph selection.  Binding data Before creating a chart, we will create a set of divs bound to a simple dataset and  improve the example step-by-step in order to understand the process of creating   a chart. We will begin with a data array that contains three strings and use D3 to  create three corresponding div elements, each one with a paragraph that contains   the strings. In the example file, we have a div element classed chart-example and  with ID chart. This div element will be used as container for the divs to be created:      In the script, we define our dataset as an array with three strings:  var data = ['a', 'b', 'c'];  For each element, we want to append an inner div, and in each one of them,   we append a paragraph. The container div can be selected using its ID:  var divChart = d3.select 'chart' ;  Next, we create a selection that contains the divs classed data-item and bind the  data array to this selection:  var divItems = divChart.selectAll 'div.data-item'      .data data ;  Before invoking the data method, keep in mind that the inner divs don't exist yet,  and the selection will be empty. We can check this by creating an empty selection:     This will return true > divChart.selectAll 'p.test-empty-selection' .empty    [ 23 ]   The data   method joins the data array with the current selection. At this point, the  data elements in the divItems selection don't have corresponding DOM nodes. The  divItems.enter   selection stores placeholder DOM nodes for the elements to be  created. We can instantiate new divs using the append method:  divItems.enter       .append 'div'      .attr 'class', 'data-item' ;  As seen in the preceding example, the append method returns the created divs,   and we can set its class directly. The divItems selection now contains three   div elements, each one bounded to a data item. We can append a paragraph   to each div and set its content:  var pItems = divItems.append 'p'      .html function d  { return d; } ;  The method-chaining pattern allows us to write the same sequence of operations in  one single, compact statement:  d3.select 'chart' .selectAll 'div.data-item'      .data data      .enter       .append 'div'      .attr 'class', 'data-item'      .append 'p'      .html function d  { return d; } ;  The div elements and their corresponding paragraphs are created inside the  container div. Refer to the following screenshot:  The creation of DOM elements by joining a data array with a selection of div elements  [ 24 ]   Encapsulating the creation of elements We could add more elements on top of the previous elements, but the code would  become confusing and monolithic. The selection.call method allows us to  encapsulate the creation of the div contents as follows:  d3.select 'chart' .selectAll 'div.data-item'      .data data      .enter       .append 'div'      .attr 'class', 'data-item'      .call function selection  {         selection.each function d  {             d3.select this .append 'p' .html d ;         } ;     } ;  The call method invokes its argument function, passing the current selection as the  argument and setting the this context to the current selection.  The selection.each method invokes its own argument function, passing the bound  data item to the function. The this context in the function is the current DOM  element; in our case, it's the recently created div.  The argument of the call method can be defined elsewhere. We will define the  initDiv function and use it to create the content of the div:  function initDiv selection  {     selection.each function data  {         d3.select this .append 'p'              .html data ;     } ; }  The initDiv function encapsulates the creation and configuration of the div  contents; the code that creates the elements is more compact, shown as follows:  d3.select 'chart' .selectAll 'div.data-item'      .data data      .enter       .append 'div'      .attr 'class', 'data-item'      .call initDiv ;  [ 25 ]   Creating the svg element We can use the same structure to create an svg element inside the inner div instead  of the paragraph. We will need to define the width and height of svg as follows:  var width = 400,     height = 40;  We will change the name of the initDiv function to the more appropriate name,  chart, and replace the creation of the paragraph with the creation of svg and a  background rectangle. Note that we are binding the svg selection to an array with a  single element  the [data] array  and appending the svg and the rectangle only to  the enter   selection as follows:  function chart selection  {     selection.each function data  {            Select and bind the svg element.         var div = d3.select this .attr 'class', 'data-item' ,             svg = div.selectAll 'svg' .data [data] ,             svgEnter = svg.enter  ;             Append the svg and the rectangle on enter.         svgEnter.append 'svg'              .attr 'width', width              .attr 'height', height              .append 'rect'              .attr 'width', width              .attr 'height', height              .attr 'fill', 'white' ;     } ; }  The code to create the svg element in each div remains the same except for the name  of the chart function, shown as follows:  d3.select 'chart' .selectAll 'div.data-item'      .data data      .enter       .append 'div'      .attr 'class', 'data-item'      .call chart ;  [ 26 ]   The barcode chart A barcode chart displays a series of discrete events in a given time interval, showing  the occurrence of each event with a small vertical bar. It uses the position of the bars  as the principal visual variable, giving the reader a clear idea of the distribution of  events in time. It might have a time axis or it might represent a fixed time interval.  As it is a very compact display, a barcode chart can be integrated along with the text  in a paragraph or in a table, giving context and allowing parallel comparison. Refer  to the following screenshot:  An example of barcode charts in a table  In the previous section, we created an svg element using a charting function.   In that implementation, the width and height are global variables, and as we all  know, global variables are evil. A chart can have dozens of configurable values,   and we can't depend on the user to define each one of them properly. To provide  default values and encapsulate the chart-related variables, we will create a closure   the chart function  and define the variables in its private scope, as follows:     Closure to create a private scope for the charting function. var barcodeChart = function   {         Definition of the chart variables.     var width = 600,         height = 30;         Charting function.     function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {                Bind the dataset to the svg selection.             var div = d3.select this ,  [ 27 ]                   svg = div.selectAll 'svg' .data [data] ;                 Create the svg element on enter, and append a                background rectangle to it.             svg.enter                   .append 'svg'                  .attr 'width', width                  .attr 'height', height                  .append 'rect'                  .attr 'width', width                  .attr 'height', height                  .attr 'fill', 'white' ;         } ;     }  Note that the barcodeChart function returns an instance of the chart function,  which will be used to create the chart later. Refer to the following code:      return chart; };     The Dataset var data = ['a', 'b', 'c'];     Get the charting function. var barcode = barcodeChart  ;     Bind the data array with the data-item div selection, and call    the barcode function on each div.  d3.select 'chart' .selectAll 'div.data-item'      .data data      .enter       .append 'div'      .attr 'class', 'data-item'      .call barcode ;  Accessor methods The width and height are attributes of the chart function, and the barcode function  has access to these variables. To allow the user to configure the chart attributes, we  will add accessor methods to the chart. We will also add a margin attribute as follows:  var barcodeChart = function   {         Chart Variables.Attributes  [ 28 ]       var width = 600,         height = 30,         margin = {top: 5, right: 5, bottom: 5, left: 5};      function chart selection  {            Chart creation ...     }         Accessor function for the width     chart.width = function value  {         if  !arguments.length  { return width; }         width = value;            Returns the chart to allow method chaining.         return chart;     };         Accessor functions for the height and the margin ...      return chart; };  Note that when invoked without arguments, the accessor method will return   the variable value. When setting the value, the accessor method will set the value  and return the chart. This allows us to call other accessors using method chaining,   as follows:     Create and configure the chart. var barcode = barcodeChart       .width 600      .height 25 ;  Chart initialization In the chart function, we can use the call method to encapsulate the initialization  code. We will add the chart.svgInit method, which will be in charge of setting  the size of the svg element, create a container group for the chart, and add the  background rectangle as follows:     Initialize the SVG Element  function svgInit svg  {        Set the SVG size     svg         .attr 'width', width   [ 29 ]           .attr 'height', height ;         Create and translate the container group     var g = svg.append 'g'          .attr 'class', 'chart-content'          .attr 'transform', 'translate ' + [margin.top,   margin.left] + ' ' ;         Add a background rectangle     g.append 'rect'          .attr 'width', width - margin.left - margin.right          .attr 'height', height - margin.top - margin.bottom          .attr 'fill', 'white' ; };  In the chart function, we call the svgInit function that passes the appended   svg element. The chart function is more compact. Refer to the following code:  function chart selection  {     selection.each function data  {            Bind the dataset to the svg selection.         var div = d3.select this ,             svg = div.selectAll 'svg' .data [data] ;             Call thesvgInit function on enter.         svg.enter               .append 'svg'              .call svgInit ;     } ; }  With the chart structure ready, we can proceed to draw the bars.  Adding data We will generate a data array by repeatedly adding a random number of seconds  to a date. To compute these random number of seconds, we will generate a random  variable of exponential distribution. The details about how to generate the random  variable are not important; just remember that the randomInterval function returns  a random number of seconds as follows:     Compute a random interval using an Exponential Distribution  function randomInterval avgSeconds  {     return Math.floor -Math.log Math.random    * 1000 * avgSeconds ; };  [ 30 ]   We will create a function that returns an array with objects that have increasing  random dates:     Create or extend an array of increasing dates by adding     a number of random seconds. function addData data, numItems, avgSeconds  {        Compute the most recent time in the data array.     var n = data.length,         t =  n > 0  ? data[n - 1].date : new Date  ;         Append items with increasing times in the data array.     for  var k = 0; k < numItems - 1; k += 1  {         t = new Date t.getTime   + randomInterval avgSeconds  ;         data.push {date: t} ;     }      return data; }  Invoking the function with an empty array as the first argument will generate the  initial data with 150 elements, with an average of 300 seconds between each date:  var data = addData [], 150, 300 ;  The structure of the data array will be something like the following code:  data = [     {date: Tue Jan 01 2013 09:48:52 GMT-0600  PDT },     {date: Tue Jan 01 2013 09:49:14 GMT-0600  PDT },     ...     {date: Tue Jan 01 2013 21:57:31 GMT-0600  PDT } ]  With the dataset ready, we can modify the chart function to draw the bars. First, we  compute the horizontal scale, select the container group, and create a selection for  the bars. Refer to the following code:  function chart selection  {     selection.each function data  {            Creation of the SVG element ...             Compute the horizontal scale.         var xScale = d3.time.scale               .domain d3.extent data, function d  { return d.date;                 }    [ 31 ]               .range [0, width - margin.left - margin.right] ;             Select the containing group         var g = svg.select 'g.chart-content' ;             Bind the data to the lines selection.         var bars = g.selectAll 'line'              .data data, function d  { return d.date; } ;             Append the bars on the enter selection ...     } ; }  Each bar should be associated with a date, so we configure the key function to return  the date. We append the line elements on enter and set the initial position and stroke  of the bars as follows:         Append the bars on the enter selection     bars.enter  .append 'line'          .attr 'x1', function d  { return xScale d.date ; }          .attr 'x2', function d  { return xScale d.date ; }          .attr 'y1', 0          .attr 'y2', height - margin.top - margin.bottom          .attr 'stroke', '000'          .attr 'stroke-opacity', 0.5 ;  We set the stroke-opacity attribute to 0.5, so we can see the overlapping lines.  Finally, the barcode chart has some bars, as shown in the following screenshot:  The first version of the barcode chart  Adding the date accessor function The current implementation of the chart assumes that the dataset contains objects  with the date attribute. This is an inconvenience, because the user could have a  data array with the date information in an attribute named time, or the user might  need to process other attributes to compute a valid date. We will add a configurable  accessor for the date as follows:  var barcodeChart = function   {         Set the default date accessor function  [ 32 ]       var value = function d  { return d.date; };         chart function ...         Accessor for the value function     chart.value = function accessorFunction  {         if  !arguments.length  { return value; }         value = accessorFunction;         return chart;     };      return chart; };  We need to replace the references to d.date with invocations to the value method in  the chart function as follows:  function chart selection  {     selection.each function data  {         Creation of the SVG element ...         Compute the horizontal scale using the date accessor.     var xScale = d3.time.scale           .domain d3.extent data, value           .range [0, width - margin.left - margin.right] ;        ...         Bind the data to the bars selection.     var bars = g.selectAll 'line' .data data, value ;         Create the bars on enter and set their attributes, using        the date accessor function.     bars.enter  .append 'line'          .attr 'x1', function d  { return xScale value d  ; }          .attr 'x2', function d  { return xScale value d  ; }             set more attributes ...         .attr 'stroke-opacity', 0.5 ;  A user who has the date information in the time attribute can use the chart by setting  the value accessor without modifying the chart code or the data array:     This will work if the array of objects with the time attribute. var barcode = barcodeChart       .value function d  { return d.time; } ;  [ 33 ]   A barcode chart must represent a fixed time interval, but right now, the chart shows  all the bars. We would like to remove the bars that are older than a certain time  interval. We will then add the timeInterval variable:         Default time interval.     var timeInterval = d3.time.day;  Add the corresponding accessor method:         Time Interval Accessor     chart.timeInterval = function value  {         if  !arguments.length  { return timeInterval; }         timeInterval = value;         return chart;     };  Then, update the horizontal scale in the chart function:         Compute the first and last dates of the time interval     var lastDate = d3.max data, value ,         firstDate = timeInterval.offset lastDate, -1 ;         Compute the horizontal scale with the correct domain     var xScale = d3.time.scale           .domain [firstDate, lastDate]          .range [0, width - margin.left - margin.right] ;  The chart width represents the default time interval, and the user can set the time  interval by using the timeInterval accessor method:  var barcode = barcodeChart       .timeInterval d3.time.day ;  The barcode chart length represents 24 hours. The dataset contains events covering  about 11 hours as shown in the following barcode:  [ 34 ]   Updating the dataset In most parts of the applications, the dataset is not static. The application might   poll the server every couple of minutes, receive a stream of data items, or update   the data on user request. In the case of a barcode chart, the new items will probably  have more recent dates than the existing data items. The barcode chart is supposed   to display the most recent item at the right-hand side of the chart, moving the old bars  to the left-hand side. We can do this by updating the position of the bars as follows:         Create the bars on enter ...         Update the position of the bars.     bars.transition           .duration 300          .attr 'x1', function d  { return xScale value d  ; }          .attr 'x2', function d  { return xScale value d  ; } ;  The transitions aren't just to make the chart look pretty; they allow the user to follow  the objects as they change. This is called object constancy. If we just move the bars  instantly, the user might have difficulty understanding what happened with the old  bars or realizing whether the chart changed at all. We will add a button to add items  to the dataset in the page as follows:   Add data      We can use D3 to configure the callback for the click event of the button. The callback  function will add 30 new items to the dataset  with 180 seconds between them on an  average  and rebind the selection to the updated dataset as follows:  d3.select 'btn-update'      .on 'click', function   {            Add more random data to the dataset.         data = addData data, 30, 3 * 60 ;            Rebind the data-item selection with the updated dataset.         d3.select 'chart' .selectAll 'div.data-item'              .data [data]              .call barcode ;     } ;  [ 35 ]   Fixing the enter and exit transitions If we click on the button a couple of times, we will see the new bars appear suddenly,  and then, the existing bars shifting to the left-hand side. We would expect the new bars  to enter by the right-hand side, moving all the bars together to the left-hand side. This  can be achieved by adding the new bars using xScale as it was before adding the new  elements and then updating the position of all the bars at the same time.  This strategy will work, except that we didn't store the previous state of xScale.   We do, however, have access to the data before appending the new elements.   We can access the data bounded to the selection of lines as follows:         Select the chart group and the lines in that group     var g = svg.select 'g.chart-content' ,         lines = g.selectAll 'line' ;  The first time we use the chart, the lines selection will be empty; in this case, we  need to use the most recent item of the data array to compute the last date. If the  selection isn't empty, we can use the previous most recent date. We can use the  selection.empty method to check whether or not the chart contains bars as follows:         Compute the most recent date from the dataset.     var lastDate = d3.max data, value ;         Replace the lastDate with the most recent date of the        dataset before the update, if the selection is not empty.     lastDate = lines.empty   ? lastDate : d3.max lines.data  , value ;         Compute the date of the lastDate minus the time interval.     var firstDate = timeInterval.offset lastDate, -1 ;         Compute the horizontal scale with the new extent.     var xScale = d3.time.scale           .domain [firstDate, lastDate]          .range [0, width - margin.left - margin.right] ;  We can bind the data now, and we can create the new bars and set their position  with the old scale:         Select the lines and bind the new dataset to it.     var bars = g.selectAll 'line' .data data, value ;         Create the bars on enter     bars.enter  .append 'line'          .attr 'x1', function d  { return xScale value d  ; }             set more attributes ...         .attr 'stroke-opacity', 0.5 ;  [ 36 ]   Once the new bars were appended, we can update the xScale domain to include the  most recent items and update the position of all the bars:         Update the scale with the new dataset.     lastDate = d3.max data, value ;     firstDate = timeInterval.offset lastDate, -1 ;     xScale.domain [firstDate, lastDate] ;         Update the position of the bars, with the updated scale.     bars.transition           .duration 300          .attr 'x1', function d  { return xScale value d  ; }          .attr 'x2', function d  { return xScale value d  ; } ;  The last thing to do is to remove the bars that don't have corresponding data items,  fading them by changing their stroke opacity to zero:         Remove the bars that don't have corresponding data items.     bars.exit  .transition           .duration 300          .attr 'stroke-opacity', 0          .remove  ;  A basic version of the barcode chart is now ready. There are some additional  attributes of the chart that we might want to configure; a user might want to change  the color of the bars, their opacity, the duration of the transitions, or the color of the  background rectangle.  Using the barcode chart  In this section, we will use the barcode chart with a more complex dataset and  learn how to use the chart that is integrated within a table. Imagine that we have  an application that monitors the mention of stocks on Twitter. One element of this  fictional application might be a table that displays the aggregated information about  the stock's mentions and the barcode chart with the mentions of the last day. We  will assume that the data is already loaded on the page. Each data item will have  the name of the stock, an array with mentions, and the average of mentions by hour.  Refer to the following code:  var data = [     {name: 'AAPL', mentions: [...], byHour: 34.3},     {name: 'MSFT', mentions: [...], byHour: 11.1},     {name: 'GOOG', mentions: [...], byHour: 19.2},     {name: 'NFLX', mentions: [...], byHour:  6.7} ];  [ 37 ]   The mentions array will have objects with the date attribute. These items can have  other attributes as well. We will create the table structure with D3, binding the rows  of the table body to the data array. We create the table by binding the table element  with a single element array as follows:     Create a table element. var table = d3.select 'chart' .selectAll 'table'      .data [data]      .enter       .append 'table'      .attr 'class', 'table table-condensed' ;  We append the table head and body:     Append the table head and body to the table. var tableHead = table.append 'thead' ,     tableBody = table.append 'tbody' ;  We add three cells in the row header to display the column headers:     Add the table header content. tableHead.append 'tr' .selectAll 'th'      .data ['Name', 'Today Mentions', 'mentions hour']      .enter       .append 'th'      .text function d  { return d; } ;  We append one row to the table body for each element in the data array:     Add the table body rows. var rows = tableBody.selectAll 'tr'      .data data      .enter       .append 'tr' ;  For each row, we need to add three cells, one with the stock name, one with the  barcode chart, and the last one with the hourly average of mentions. To add the  name, we simply add a cell and set the text:     Add the stock name cell. rows.append 'td'      .text function d  { return d.name; } ;  [ 38 ]   Now, we add a cell with the chart. The data item bound to the row is not an array  with dates, so we can't call the barcode function directly. Using the datum method,  we can bind the data item to the td element. Note that this method does not perform  a join, and thus, it doesn't have the enter and exit selections:     Add the barcode chart. rows.append 'td'      .datum function d  { return d.mentions; }      .call barcode ;  The datum method receives a data item directly; it doesn't require an array like the  data method. Finally, we add the last cell with the hourly average of mentions. The  content of this cell is a number, so it must be aligned to the right-hand side:     Add the number of mentions by hour, aligned to the right. rows.append 'td' .append 'p'      .attr 'class', 'pull-right'      .html function d  { return d.byHour; } ;  The barcode charts are integrated in the table, along with other information about the  stock mentions as shown in the following screenshot:  The barcode chart, integrated within a table, displaying fictional Twitter mentions of stocks  We used D3 to create a data-bound table with a chart in each row. We could   have created the structure and header of the table in the HTML document and   bound the data array to the rows in the table body, but we created the entire table  with D3, instead.  If the table will be used in more than one page, we can also think of creating the table  as a reusable chart, using the structure presented in the previous section. We could  even add an attribute and an accessor to set the charting function and use the table  chart with a different chart without having to change the code of the table chart.  [ 39 ]   Creating a layout algorithm  Every chart makes assumptions about the kind and structure of the data that they  can display. A scatter plot needs pairs of quantitative values, a bar chart requires  categories with a quantitative dimension, and a tree map needs nested objects. To  use a chart, the user will need to group, split, or nest the original dataset to fit the  chart requirements. Functions that perform these transformations are called layout  algorithms. D3 already provides a good set of layouts, from the simple pie layout  to the more complex force layout. In this section, we will lean how to implement  a layout algorithm, and we will use it to create a simple visualization using the  barcode dataset.  The radial layout The array with dates used in the barcode example can be visualized in several  ways. The barcode chart represents every data item as a small bar in a time interval.  Another useful way to display a series of events is to group them in intervals. The  most common among these kind of visualizations is a bar chart, with one bar for  each time interval and the height of each bar representing the number of events that  occurred in the corresponding time interval. A radial chart is a circular arrangement of arc segments, each one representing  a category. In this chart, each arc has the same angle, and the area of each arc is  proportional to the number of items in the category. We will create a radial layout  that groups and counts the events in hourly segments and compute the start and   end angles for each arc.  The purpose of a layout algorithm is to allow the user to easily transform its dataset  to the format required by a chart. The layout usually allows a certain amount of  customization. We will implement the layout function as a closure with accessors   to configure the layout behavior as follows:  var radialLayout = function   {         Layout algorithm.     function layout data  {         var grouped = [];            Transform and returns the grouped data ...         return grouped;     }     return layout; };  [ 40 ]   The usage of a layout is similar to the usage of the barcode chart. First, we invoke  RadialLayout to get the layout function and then call the layout with the dataset  as the argument in order to obtain the output dataset. We will generate an array of  random dates using the addData function from the previous section:     Generate a dataset with random dates. var data = addData [], 300, 20 * 60 ;     Get the layout function. var layout = radialLayout  ;     Compute the ouput data. var output = layout data ;  We need the layout to group and count the data items for each hour and to   compute the start and end angles for each arc. To make the counting process   easier, we will use a map to temporarily store the output items. D3 includes   d3.map, a dictionary-like structure that provides key-value storage:  function layout data  {        Create a map to store the data for each hour.     var hours = d3.range 0, 24 ,         gmap = d3.map  ,         groups = [];         Append a data item for each hour.     hours.forEach function h  {         gmap.set h, {hour: h, startAngle: 0, endAngle: 0, count: 0} ;     } ;         ...         Copy the values of the map and sort the output data array.     groups = gmap.values  ;     groups.sort function a, b  { return a.hour > b.hour ? 1 : -1; } ;     return groups; }  [ 41 ]   As the layout must return an array, we will need to transfer the map values to the  grouped array and sort it to return it as the output. The output items don't have any  useful information yet:  [     {hour:  0, startAngle: 0, endAngle: 0, count: 0},     ...     {hour: 23, startAngle: 0, endAngle: 0, count: 0} ]  The next thing to do is to count the items that belong to each hour. To do this,   we iterate through the input data and compute the hour of the date attribute:         Count the items belonging to each hour     data.forEach function d  {            Get the hour from the date attribute of each data item.         var hour = d.date.getHours  ;             Get the output data item corresponding to the item             hour.         var val = gmap.get hour ;             We increment the count and set the value in the map.         val.count += 1;         gmap.set hour, val ;     } ;  At this point, the output contains the count attribute with the correct value. As we  did in the barcode chart, we will add a configurable accessor function to retrieve the  date attribute:  var radialLayout = function   {        Default date accessor     var value = function d  { return d.date; }      function layout data  {            Content of the layout function ...     }         Date Accessor Function     layout.value = function accessorFunction  {         if  !arguments.length  { return value; }         value = accessorFunction;         return layout; };  [ 42 ]   In the layout function, we replace the references to d.date with invocations to the  date accessor method, value d . The user now can configure the date accessor  function with the same syntax as that in the barcode chart:     Create and configure an instance of the layout function. var layout = radialLayout       .value function d  { return d.date; } ;  Computing the angles With the count attribute ready, we can proceed to compute the start and end angles  for each output item. The angle for each arc will be the the same, so we can compute  itemAngle and then iterate through the hours array as follows:         Compute equal angles for each hour item.     var itemAngle = 2 * Math.PI   24;         Adds a data item for each hour.     hours.forEach function h  {         gmap.set h, {             hour: h,             startAngle: h * itemAngle,             endAngle:  h + 1  * itemAngle,             count: 0         } ;     } ;  The output dataset now has the start and end angles set. Note that each data item has  a value that is 1 24th of the circumference:  [     {hour:  0, startAngle: 0,      endAngle: 0.2618, count:  7},     {hour:  1, startAngle: 0.2618, endAngle: 0.5236, count: 14},     ...     {hour: 23, startAngle: 6.0214, endAngle: 6.2832, count: 17} ]  Here, we used the entire circumference, but a user might want to use a semicircle  or want to start in a different angle. We will add the startAngle and endAngle  attributes and the angleExtent accessor method in order to allow the user to set   the angle extent of the chart:  var radialLayout = function   {         Default values for the angle extent.     var startAngle = 0,  [ 43 ]           endAngle = 2 * Math.PI;         Layout function ...         Angle Extent     layout.angleExtent = function value  {         if  !arguments.length  { return value; }         startAngle = value[0];         endAngle = value[1];         return layout;     }; };  We need to change the itemAngle variable in order to use the new angle range.   Also, we add the layout start angle to the start and end angles for each output item:         Angle for each hour item.     var itemAngle =  endAngle - startAngle    24;         Append a data item for each hour.     hours.forEach function h  {         gmap.set h, {             hour: h,             startAngle: startAngle + h * itemAngle,             endAngle: startAngle +  h + 1  * itemAngle,             count: 0         } ;     } ;  We can configure the start and end angles of the layout to use a fraction of   the circumference:     Create and configure the layout function. var layout = radialLayout       .angleExtent [Math.PI   3, 2 * Math.PI   3] ;  In this section, we implemented a simple layout algorithm that counts and groups   an array of events in hours and computes the start and end angles to display   the returned value as a radial chart. As we did in the barcode chart example,   we implemented the layout as a closure with getter and setter methods.  [ 44 ]   Using the layout In this section, we will use the radial layout to create a radial chart. To keep the code  simple, we will create the visualization without creating a chart function. We begin  by creating a container for the radial chart:      We define the visualization variables and append the svg element to the container.  We append a group and translate it to the center of the svg element:     Visualization Variables var width = 400,     height = 200,     innerRadius = 30,     outerRadius = 100;     Append a svg element to the div and set its size. var svg = d3.select 'radial-chart' .append 'svg'      .attr 'width', width      .attr 'height', height ;     Create the group and translate it to the center. var g = svg.append 'g'      .attr 'transform', 'translate ' + [width   2, height   2] + ' ' ;  We represent each hour as an arc. To compute the arcs, we need to create a   radius scale:     Compute the radius scale. var rScale = d3.scale.sqrt       .domain [0, d3.max output, function d  { return d.count; } ]      .range [2, outerRadius - innerRadius] ;  As we have the angles and the radius, we can configure the d3.svg.arc generator to  create the arc paths for us. The arc generator will use the startAngle and endAngle  attributes to create the arc path:     Create an arc generator. var arc = d3.svg.arc       .innerRadius innerRadius      .outerRadius function d  {          return innerRadius +    rScale d.count ;     } ;  [ 45 ]   The arc function receives objects with startAngle, endAngle, and count attributes  and returns the path string that represents the arc. Finally, we select the path objects  in the container group, bind the data, and append the paths:     Append the paths to the group. g.selectAll 'path'      .data output      .enter       .append 'path'          .attr 'd', function d  { return arc d ; }          .attr 'fill', 'grey'          .attr 'stroke', 'white'          .attr 'stroke-width', 1 ;  The radial chart represents the number of items in each hour as radial arcs. Refer to  the following screenshot:  We have shown you how to use the radial layout to create a simple visualization.   As we mentioned previously, the layout can be used to create other charts as well.  For instance, if we ignore the start and end angles, we can use the radial layout  to create a bar chart or even use the output data to create a table with the data  aggregated by hour.  [ 46 ]   Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to create a reusable chart and how to add  configuration methods to it so that the chart can be used in several projects   without having to change its code in order to use it. We created a barcode chart   and used it with data with a different format. We also learned how to create a  reusable layout algorithm and how to use it to transform the data source to the  format expected by a chart.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to create data visualizations in D3 for  browsers without SVG support using canvas and div elements.  [ 47 ]    Creating Visualizations  without SVG  Most of the visualizations created with D3 use the SVG element. SVG graphics are  resolution independent, which means that they can be scaled without pixelation,  and they are relatively easy to create with D3. The SVG elements are also part of the  DOM tree and allow us to select and manipulate individual elements of the figures  and to change their attributes, triggering an automatic update by the browser.  There are a significant number of users who don't use a browser with SVG support,  and sometimes, we can't just forget them. In this chapter, we will examine alternatives  that provide visualizations without using SVG. We will create a visualization using  only the div elements, discuss libraries that provide SVG support for older browsers,  and show an example of integrating D3 and the canvas element.  SVG support in the browser market  The global browser market has a good support for SVG, both in mobile and desktop  browsers. There is, however, a significant portion of users who don't enjoy SVG  support; the most notable examples are the users of Internet Explorer 8.0 and   older as well as users of the stock browser of Android under 3.0.  According to http:  caniuse.com , about 86 percent of the global browser market  has basic SVG support  as of May 2014 . Most of the applications can't afford to  leave 14 percent of their users behind. With these users in mind, we will learn how  to create data visualizations without using SVG and how to add SVG support to the  browser using polyfilling. You can check a more up-to-date version of this and other  tables on Can I use...  http:  caniuse.com feat=svg .   Visualizations without SVG  In this section, we will create a visualization without using SVG. We will create a  bubble chart to show the usage of browser versions in the browser market. A circle  will represent each browser version; the area of the circle will be proportional to the  global browser usage. Each browser will be assigned a different color. We will use  the force layout to group the bubbles on the screen. To follow the examples, open the  chapter03 01-bubble-chart.html file.  Loading and sorting the data To make the processing easier, the browser market data was arranged in a JSON file.  The main object will have a name that describes the dataset and an array that will  contain the data for each browser version. Refer to the following code:  {   "name": "Browser Market",   "values": [     {       "name": "Internet Explorer",       "version": 8,       "platform": "desktop",       "usage": 8.31,       "current": "false"     },        more items ...   ] }  We will use the d3.json method to load the JSON data. The d3.json method creates  an asynchronous request to the specified URL and invokes the callback argument  when the file is loaded or when the request fails. The callback function receives an  error  if any  and the parsed data. There are similar methods to load text, CSV, TSV,  XML, and HTML files. Refer to the following code:           Load the data asynchronously.     d3.json ' chapter03 browsers.json', function error, data  {         Handle errors getting or parsing the JSON data.     if  error  {         console.error 'Error accessing or parsing the JSON file.' ;  [ 50 ]           return error;     }         visualization code ...  } ;    Note that the callback function will be invoked only when the data is loaded. This  means that the code after the d3.json invocation will be executed while the request  is being made, and the data won't be available at this point. The visualization code  should go either inside the callback or somewhere else and should use events to  notify the charting code that the data is ready. For now, we will add the rendering  code inside the callback.  We will create the circles with the div elements. To avoid the smaller elements being  hidden by the bigger elements, we will sort the items and create the elements in  decreasing usage order, as follows:         Access the data items.     var items = data.values;         Sort the items by decreasing usage.     items.sort function a, b  { return b.usage-a.usage; } ;  The Array.prototype.sort instance method sorts the array in place using a  comparator function. The comparator should receive two array items: a and b. If a  must go before b in the sorted array, the comparator function must return a negative  number; if b should go first, the comparator function must return a positive value.  The force layout method The force layout is a method to distribute elements in a given area, which avoids  overlap between the elements and keeps them in the drawing area. The position of  the elements is computed based on simple constraints, such as adding a repulsive  force between the elements and an attractive force that pulls the elements towards  the center of the figure. The force layout is specially useful to create bubble and  network charts.  [ 51 ]   Although the layout doesn't enforce any visual representation, it's commonly used to  create network charts, displaying the nodes as circles and the links as lines between  the nodes. We will use the force layout to compute the position of the circles, without  lines between them, as follows:         Size of the visualization container.     var width = 700,         height = 200;         Configure the force layout.     var force = d3.layout.force           .nodes items          .links []          .size [width, height] ;  As we don't intend to represent the relationships between the browser versions,   we will set the links attribute to an empty array. To start the force computation,   we invoke the start method as follows:         Start the force simulation.     force.start  ;  The force layout will append additional properties to our data items. Of these new  attributes, we will use only the x and y attributes, which contain the computed  position for each node. Note that the original data items shouldn't have names that  conflict with these new attributes:  {     "name": "Android Browser",     "version": 3,     "platform": "mobile",     "usage": 0.01,     "current": "false",     "index": 0,     "weight": 0,     "x": 522.7463498711586,     "y": 65.54744869936258,     "px": 522.7463498711586,     "py": 65.54744869936258 }  Having computed the position of the circles, we can proceed to draw them. As we  promised not to use SVG, we will need to use other elements to represent our circles.  One option is to use the div elements. There are several ways to specify the position  of divs, but we will use absolute positioning.  [ 52 ]   A block element styled with absolute positioning can be positioned by setting its top  and left offset properties  the bottom and right offsets can be specified as well . The  offsets will be relative to their closest positioned ancestors in the DOM tree. If none  of its ancestors are positioned, the offset will be relative to the viewport  or the body  element, depending on the browser . We will use a positioned container div and then  set the position of the divs to absolute. The container element will be the div with  the chart ID. We will select this to modify its style to use the relative position and  set its width and height to appropriate values, as follows:        We will also set padding to 0 so that we don't have to account for it in the  computation of the inner element positions. Note that in order to specify the   style attributes that represent length, we need to specify the units, except when   the length is zero, as follows:         Select the container div and configure its attributes     var containerDiv = d3.select 'chart'          .style 'position', 'relative'          .style 'width', width + 'px'          .style 'height', height + 'px'          .style 'padding', 0          .style 'background-color', 'eeeeec' ;  We can now create the inner divs. As usual, we will select the elements to be created,  bind the data array to the selection, and append the new elements on enter. We will  also set the style attributes to use absolute positioning, and set their offsets and their  width and height to 10px as follows:         Create a selection for the bubble divs, bind the data        array and set its attributes.     var bubbleDivs = containerDiv.selectAll 'div.bubble'          .data items          .enter           .append 'div'          .attr 'class', 'bubble'          .style 'position', 'absolute'          .style 'width', '10px'          .style 'height', '10px'          .style 'background-color', '222' ;  [ 53 ]   The force layout will compute the position of the nodes in a series of steps or ticks.  We can register a listener function to be invoked on each tick event and update the  position of the nodes in the listener as follows:         Register a listener function for the force tick event, and        update the position of each div on tick.     force.on 'tick', function   {         bubbleDiv            .style 'top', function d  { return  d.y - 5  + 'px'; }             .style 'left', function d  { return  d.x - 5 + 'px';                } ;     } ;  The divs will move nicely to their positions. Note that we subtract half of the div  width and height when setting the offset. The divs will be centered in the position  computed by the force layout as shown in the following screenshot:  The nodes are nicely positioned, but they all have the same size and color  Setting the color and size Now that we have our nodes positioned, we can set the color and size of the div  elements. To create a color scale for the nodes, we need to get a list with unique  browser names. In our dataset, the items are browser versions; therefore, most   of the browser names are repeated. We will use the d3.set function to create   a set and use it to discard duplicated names, as follows:     Compute unique browser names. var browserList = items.map function d  { return d.name; } ,     browserNames = d3.set browserList .values  ;  [ 54 ]   With the browser list ready, we can create a categorical color scale. Categorical scales  are used to represent values that are different in kind; in our case, each browser will  have a corresponding color:         Create a categorical color scale with 10 levels.     var cScale = d3.scale.category10           .domain browserNames ;  The default range of d3.scale.category10 is a set of 10 colors with similar  lightness but different hue, specifically designed to represent categorical data. We  could use a different set of colors, but the default range is a good starting point. If  we had more than 10 browsers, we would need to use a color scale with more colors.  We will also set the border-radius style attribute to half the height  and width  of  the div in order to give the divs a circular appearance. Note that the border-radius  attribute is not supported in all the browsers but has better support than SVG. In  browsers that don't support this attribute, the divs will be shown as squares:         Create a selection for the bubble divs, bind the data        array and set its attributes.     var bubbleDivs = containerDiv.selectAll 'div.bubble'          .data items          .enter           .append 'div'             set other attributes ...         .style 'border-radius', '5px'          .style 'background-color', function d  {              return cScale d.name ;         } ;  We can now compute the size of the circles. To provide an accurate visual  representation, the area of the circles should be proportional to the quantitative  dimensions that they represent, in our case, the market share of each version. As   the area of a circle is proportional to the square of the radius, the radius of the circles  must be proportional to the square root of the market share. We set the minimum  and maximum radius values and use this extent to create the scale:         Minimum and maximum radius     var radiusExtent = [10, 50];         create the layout ...         Create the radius scale     var rScale = d3.scale.sqrt           .domain d3.extent items, function d  { return d.usage; }           .range radiusExtent ;  [ 55 ]   We will use the radius to compute the width, height, position, and border radius of  each circle. To avoid calling the scale function several times  and to have cleaner  code , we will add the radius as a new attribute of our data items:         Add the radius to each item, to compute it only once.     items.forEach function d  {         d.r = rScale d.usage ;     } ;  We can modify the width, height, and border radius of the divs to use the new  attribute, as follows:         Create the bubble divs.     var bubbleDivs = containerDiv.selectAll 'div.bubble'          .data items          .enter           .append 'div'             set other attributes ...         .style 'border-radius', function d  { return d.r + 'px'; }          .style 'width', function d  { return  2 * d.r  + 'px'; }          .style 'height', function d  { return  2 * d.r  + 'px'; } ;  We need to update the position of the div elements to account for the new radius:         Update the div position on each tick.     force.on 'tick', function   {         bubbleDiv             .style 'top', function d  { return  d.y - d.r  + 'px'; }              .style 'left', function d  { return  d.x - d.r + 'px'; } ;     } ;  The first draft of the visualization is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 56 ]   At this point, we have the first draft of our visualization, but there are still some  things that need to be improved. The space around each div is the same, regardless  of the size of each circle. We expect to have more space around bigger circles and less  space around smaller ones. To achieve this, we will modify the charge property of  the force layout, which controls the strength of repulsion between the nodes.  The charge method allows us to set the charge strength of each node. The default  value is -30; we will use a function to set greater charges for bigger circles. In physical  systems, the charge is proportional to the volume of the body; so, we will set the  charge to be proportional to the area of each circle as follows:     Configure the force layout. var force = d3.layout.force       .nodes items      .links []      .size [width, height]      .charge function d  { return -0.12 * d.r * d.r; }      .start  ;  We don't know in advance which proportionality constant will give a good layout; we  need to tweak this value until we are satisfied with the visual result. Bubbles created  with chart with the divs and force layout is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 57 ]   Now that we have a good first version of our visualization, we will adapt the code  to use a reusable chart pattern. As you will surely remember, a reusable chart is  implemented as a closure with the setter and getter methods as follows:  function bubbleChart   {         Chart attributes ...      function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {                 Select the container div and configure its                 attributes.             var containerDiv = d3.select this ;                 create the circles ...         } ;     }         Accessor methods ...      return chart; };  The code in the chart function is basically the same code that we have written until  now. We also added accessor methods for the color scale, width, height, and radius  extent, as well as accessor functions for the value, name, and charge function to allow  users to adapt to the repulsion force when using the chart with other datasets. We  can create and invoke the charting function in the callback of d3.json as follows:  d3.json '.. data browsers.json', function error, data  {         Handle errors getting or parsing the JSON data.     if  error  { return error; }         Create the chart instance.     var chart = bubbleChart           .width 500 ;         Bind the chart div to the data array.     d3.select 'chart'          .data [data.values]          .call chart ; } ;  [ 58 ]   The visualization is incomplete without a legend, so we will create a legend now.  This time, we will create the legend as a reusable chart from the beginning.  Creating a legend The legend should display which color represents which browser. It can also have  additional information such as the aggregated market share of each browser. We  must use the same color code as that used in the visualization:  function legendChart   {     Chart Properties ...             Charting function.     function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {          } ;     }         Accessor methods ...      return chart; };  We will implement the legend as a div element that contains paragraphs; each  paragraph will have the browser name and a small square painted with the  corresponding color. In this case, the data will be a list of browser names. We   will add a configurable color scale to make sure that the legend uses the same   colors that are used in the bubble chart:  function legendChart   {         Color Scale     var cScale = d3.scale.category20  ;         Charting function.     function chart selection  {            chart content ...     }         Color Scale Accessor     chart.colorScale = function value  {         if  !arguments.length  { return cScale; }  [ 59 ]           cScale = value;         return chart;     };      return chart; };  We can create a div for the legend and put it alongside the chart div as follows:  d3.json ' chapter03 browsers.json', function error, data  {        Create an instance of the legend chart.     var legend = legendChart           .colorScale chart.colorScale   ;         Select the container and invoke the legend.     var legendDiv = d3.select 'legend'          .data [chart.colorScale  .domain  ]          .call legend ; } ;  We used the domain of the chart's color scale as the dataset for the legend and set the  color scale of the legend with the color scale of the chart. This will ensure that you  have the same items and colors in the legend that are in the chart. We also added a  width attribute and its corresponding accessor. In the legend chart function, we can  create the title and the legend items using the data:             Select the container element and set its attributes.         var containerDiv = d3.select this              .style 'width', width + 'px' ;             Add the label 'Legend' on enter         containerDiv.selectAll 'p.legent-title'              .data [data]              .enter  .append 'p'              .attr 'class', 'legend-title'              .text 'Legend' ;             Add a div for each data item         var itemDiv = containerDiv.selectAll 'div.item'              .data data              .enter  .append 'div'              .attr 'class', 'item' ;  [ 60 ]   We have labels that show up in the legend, but we need to add a marker with the  corresponding color. To keep things simple, we will add two points and set them  with the same background and text color:          itemP.append 'span' .text '..'              .style 'color', cScale              .style 'background', cScale ;  To finish the legend, we will compute the market share of each browser. We will  create a map to store each browser name and its aggregated usage, as follows:         Create a map to aggregate the browser usage     var browsers = d3.map  ;         Adds up the usage for each browser.     data.values.forEach function d  {         var item = browsers.get d.name ;         if  item  {             browsers.set d.name, {                 name: d.name,                  usage: d.usage + item.usage             } ;         } else {             browsers.set d.name, {                 name: d.name,                  usage: d.usage             } ;         }     } ;  The final version of the bubble chart is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 61 ]   In this example, we created a simple visualization using the div elements and  displayed them as circles with the help of the border-radius attribute. Using divs  with rounded corners is not the only alternative to create this visualization without  using SVG; we could have used raster images of circles instead of div elements,  using absolute positioning and changing the image width and height.  One great example of a sophisticated visualization made without SVG is the  Electoral Map by the New York Times graphic department  http:  elections. nytimes.com 2012 ratings electoral-map . In this visualization, the user can  create their own scenarios for the presidential elections of 2012 in the United States.  Polyfilling A polyfill is a JavaScript library that replicates an API feature for the browsers  that don't have it natively. Usually, a polyfill doesn't add its own API or additional  features; it just adds the missing feature.  Polyfills are available for almost every HTML5 and CSS3 feature, but this doesn't  mean that we can start adding libraries to provide all the modern features in the web  browser. Also, the modern features can conflict with each other, so polyfills must be  included carefully. To support SVG in those browsers, the following two polyfills  can be used:     svgweb: This provides partial SVG support, falling back to Flash if the   browser doesn't support SVG  https:  code.google.com p svgweb  .     canvg: This is an SVG parser written in JavaScript. It parses the SVG element   and renders it using a canvas  https:  code.google.com p canvg  .  The first step to use a polyfill is to detect whether a feature is available in the browser  or not.  Feature detection There are several ways to find out whether the browser supports a particular feature.  One of them is to get the user agent attribute of the navigator global object, but this  is highly unreliable because the user can configure the user agent property. Another  option is try to use the feature to check whether it has the methods and properties  that we expect. However, this method is error prone and depends on the particular  feature that we are looking for.  [ 62 ]   The most reliable way is to use the Modernizr library. Despite its name, it doesn't  add any modern features to old browsers; it only detects the availability of the  HTML5 and CSS3 features. However, it does interact well with the libraries that  implement the missing features, providing a script loader to include the libraries in  order to fill the gaps. The library can be customized to include the detection of only  the features that we need.  The library performs a suite of tests to detect which features are available and   which are not, and sets the results of these tests in the Boolean attributes of the   global Modernizr object, add classes to the HTML object that explains which   features are present. The library should be loaded in the header, because the   features that we want to add must be available before the   element:        To detect the support of SVG in the browser, we can use the Modernizr.svg  property. We can also use it to properly handle the lack of support:           Handle the availability of SVG.     if  Modernizr.svg  {            Create a visualization with SVG.     } else {            Fallback visualization.     }    The canvg example We will begin our example by creating an SVG image with D3. In this example, we  will create an array of circles in SVG and then display them with canvas using the  canvg library. We begin by including the libraries in the header as follows:              [ 63 ]   For now, we will begin as usual by selecting the container div, appending the SVG  element, and setting its width and height:         Set the width and height of the figure.     var width = 600,         height = 300;         Select the container div and append the SVG element.     var containerDiv = d3.select 'canvg-demo' ,         svg = containerDiv.append 'svg'              .attr 'width', width              .attr 'height', height ;  We will generate a data array with one item per circle. We want to have one circle for  each 10 pixels. The position of each circle will be given by the x and y attributes. The  z attribute will contain a number proportional to both x and y; this number will be  used to compute the radius and color scales, as follows:         Generate data for the position and size of the rectangles.     var data = [];     for  var k = 0; k < 60; k += 1  {         for  var j = 0; j < 30; j += 1  {             data.push {                 x: 5 + 10 * k,                 y: 5 + 10 * j,                 z:  k - 50  +  20 - j              } ;         }     }  We can create the radius and color scales. Both the scales will use the extent of the z  property to set their domains:         Create a radius scale using the z attribute.     var rScale = d3.scale.sqrt           .domain d3.extent data, function d  { return d.z; }           .range [3, 5] ;         Create a linear color scale using the z attribute.     var cScale = d3.scale.linear           .domain d3.extent data, function d  { return d.z; }           .range ['204a87', 'cc0000'] ;  [ 64 ]   We can now create the circles in the SVG element. We create a selection for the circles  to be created, bind the data array, append the circles on enter, and set their attributes:         Select the circle elements, bind the dataset and append        the circles on enter.     svg.selectAll 'circle'          .data data          .enter           .append 'circle'          .attr 'cx', function d  { return d.x; }          .attr 'cy', function d  { return d.y; }          .attr 'r', function d  { return rScale d.z ; }          .attr 'fill', function d  { return cScale d.z ; }          .attr 'fill-opacity', 0.9 ;  Until now, this is a standard D3. In a browser without SVG support, the elements  will be created but not rendered. The canvg function interprets the SVG content and  draws it with canvas instead. The function receives the canvas target  where we want  SVG to be drawn , the SVG string, and an object with options. If it is called without  arguments, the function will convert all the SVG elements present on the page. We  will use this option as follows:     Replace all the SVG elements by canvas drawings. canvg  ;  If you inspect the page, you will see that the SVG element is gone, and in its place,  there is a canvas element of the same size as the original SVG. The visual result is the  same as that without using the canvg polyfill. Note that the event handlers bound to  the original SVG elements won't work. For instance, if we added a callback for the  click event on the circles, the callback for the event won't be invoked in the canvas  version. Using canvg to render an SVG element is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 65 ]   Using canvas and D3  Until now, we have used D3 to create visualizations by manipulating SVG elements  and divs. In some cases, it can be more convenient to render the visualizations using  the canvas elements, for performance reasons or if we need to transform and render  raster images. In this section, we will learn how to create figures with the HTML5  canvas element and how to use D3 to render figures with the canvas element.  Creating figures with canvas The HTML canvas element allows you to create raster graphics using JavaScript.   It was first introduced in HTML5. It enjoys more widespread support than SVG   and can be used as a fallback option. Before diving deeper into integrating canvas  and D3, we will construct a small example with canvas.  The canvas element should have the width and height attributes. This alone will  create an invisible figure of the specified size:        If the browser supports the canvas element, it will ignore any element inside the  canvas tags. On the other hand, if the browser doesn't support the canvas, it will  ignore the canvas tags, but it will interpret the content of the element. This behavior  provides a quick way to handle the lack of canvas support:              If the browser doesn't support canvas, the fallback image will be displayed. Note  that unlike the   element, the canvas closing tag     is mandatory. To  create figures with canvas, we don't need special libraries; we can create the shapes  using the canvas API:           Graphic Variables     var barw = 65,         barh = 60;         Append a canvas element, set its size and get the node.  [ 66 ]       var canvas = document.getElementById 'canvas-demo' ;         Get the rendering context.     var context = canvas.getContext '2d' ;         Array with colors, to have one rectangle of each color.     var color = ['5c3566', '6c475b', '7c584f', '8c6a44',         '9c7c39', 'ad8d2d', 'bd9f22', 'cdb117', 'ddc20b', 'edd400'];         Set the fill color and render ten rectangles.     for  var k = 0; k < 10; k += 1  {            Set the fill color.         context.fillStyle = color[k];            Create a rectangle in incremental positions.         context.fillRect k * barw, 0, barw, barh ;     }    We use the DOM API to access the canvas element with the canvas-demo ID and to  get the rendering context. Then, we set the color using the fillStyle method and  use the fillRect canvas method to create a small rectangle. Note that we need to  change fillStyle every time or all the following shapes will have the same color.  The script will render a series of rectangles, each filled with a different color, shown  as follows:  A graphic created with canvas  Canvas uses the same coordinate system as SVG, with the origin in the top-left  corner, the horizontal axis augmenting to the right, and the vertical axis augmenting  to the bottom. Instead of using the DOM API to get the canvas node, we could have  used D3 to create the node, set its attributes, and created scales for the color and  position of the shapes. Note that the shapes drawn with canvas don't exist in the  DOM tree; so, we can't use the usual D3 pattern of creating a selection, binding the  data items, and appending the elements if we are using canvas.  [ 67 ]   Creating shapes Canvas has fewer primitives than SVG. In fact, almost all the shapes must be drawn  with paths, and more steps are needed to create a path. To create a shape, we need  to open the path, move the cursor to the desired location, create the shape, and close  the path. Then, we can draw the path by filling the shape or rendering the outline.  For instance, to draw a red semicircle centered in  325, 30  and with a radius of 20,  write the following code:         Create a red semicircle.     context.beginPath  ;     context.fillStyle = 'ff0000';     context.moveTo 325, 30 ;     context.arc 325, 30, 20, Math.PI   2, 3 * Math.PI   2 ;     context.fill  ;  The moveTo method is a bit redundant here, because the arc method moves the  cursor implicitly. The arguments of the arc method are the x and y coordinates  of the arc center, the radius, and the starting and ending angle of the arc. There is  also an optional Boolean argument to indicate whether the arc should be drawn  counterclockwise. A basic shape created with the canvas API is shown in the  following screenshot:  Integrating canvas and D3 We will create a small network chart using the force layout of D3 and canvas instead  of SVG. To make the graph look more interesting, we will randomly generate the  data. We will generate 250 nodes that are sparsely connected. The nodes and links  will be stored as the attributes of the data object:         Number of Nodes     var nNodes = 250,         createLink = false;         Dataset Structure     var data = {nodes: [],links: []};  [ 68 ]   We will append nodes and links to our dataset. We will create nodes with a radius  attribute and randomly assign it a value of either 2 or 4 as follows:         Iterate in the nodes     for  var k = 0; k < nNodes; k += 1  {            Create a node with a random radius.         data.nodes.push {radius:  Math.random   > 0.3  ? 2 : 4} ;             Create random links between the nodes.     }  We will create a link with a probability of 0.1 only if the difference between the  source and target indexes are less than 8. The idea behind this way to create links   is to have only a few connections between the nodes:             Create random links between the nodes.         for  var j = k + 1; j < nNodes; j += 1  {                 Create a link with probability 0.1             createLink =  Math.random   < 0.1  &&  Math.abs k - j                  < 8 ;              if  createLink  {                    Append a link with variable distance between                     the nodes                 data.links.push {                     source: k,                     target: j,                     dist: 2 * Math.abs k - j  + 10                 } ;             }         }  We will use the radius attribute to set the size of the nodes. The links will contain  the distance between the nodes and the indexes of the source and target nodes.   We will create variables to set the width and height of the figure:         Figure width and height     var width = 650,         height = 300;  [ 69 ]   We can now create and configure the force layout. As we did in the previous section,  we will set the charge strength to be proportional to the area of each node. This time  we will also set the distance between the links using the linkDistance method of  the layout:     Create and configure the force layout var force = d3.layout.force       .size [width, height]      .nodes data.nodes      .links data.links      .charge function d  { return -1.2 * d.radius * d.radius; }      .linkDistance function d  { return d.dist; }      .start  ;  We can create a canvas element now. Note that we should use the node method to  get the canvas element, because the append and attr methods will both return a  selection, which doesn't have the canvas API methods:     Create a canvas element and set its size. var canvas = d3.select 'divcanvas-force' .append 'canvas'      .attr 'width', width + 'px'      .attr 'height', height + 'px'      .node  ;  We get the rendering context. Each canvas element has its own rendering context. We  will use the '2d' context to draw two-dimensional figures. At the time of writing this,  there are some browsers that support the webgl context; more details are available at  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web WebGL Getting_started_ with_WebGL. Refer to the following '2d' context:     Get the canvas context. var context = canvas.getContext '2d' ;  We register an event listener for the force layout's tick event. As canvas doesn't  remember previously created shapes, we need to clear the figure and redraw all   the elements on each tick:  force.on 'tick', function   {        Clear the complete figure.     context.clearRect 0, 0, width, height ;         Draw the links ...        Draw the nodes ... } ;  [ 70 ]   The clearRect method cleans the figure under the specified rectangle. In this case,  we clean the entire canvas. We can draw the links using the lineTo method. We  iterate through the links by beginning a new path for each link, by moving the cursor  to the position of the source node, and by creating a line towards the target node. We  draw the line with the stroke method:             Draw the links         data.links.forEach function d  {                Draw a line from source to target.             context.beginPath  ;             context.moveTo d.source.x, d.source.y ;             context.lineTo d.target.x, d.target.y ;             context.stroke  ;         } ;  We iterate through the nodes and draw each one. We use the arc method to represent  each node with a black circle:             Draw the nodes         data.nodes.forEach function d, i  {                Draws a complete arc for each node.             context.beginPath  ;             context.arc d.x, d.y, d.radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI, true ;             context.fill  ;         } ;  We obtain a constellation of disconnected network graphs slowly gravitating  towards the center of the figure. Using the force layout and canvas to create a  network chart is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 71 ]   We can think that to erase all the shapes and redraw each shape again and again  could have a negative impact on the performance. In fact, sometimes it's faster   to draw the figures using canvas, because this way, the browser doesn't have to  manage the DOM tree of the SVG elements  but we still have to redraw them if   the SVG elements are changed .  Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to handle the lack of SVG support in older browsers.  We learned how to create visualizations using only the div elements and how to  detect the availability of SVG support. We also discussed how to use polyfills to  provide the missing functionality. In particular, we created an example of rendering  SVG with canvas using the canvg library.  In the next chapter, we will create a color picker based on the Lab color model.   We will learn how to use the drag behavior and use it to create a reusable slider  element. Also, we will use the slider to create the color picker.  [ 72 ]   Creating a Color   Picker with D3  In this chapter, we will implement a slider and a color picker using D3. We will use  the reusable chart pattern to create the slider and the color picker. We will also learn  how to compose reusable charts in order to create more complex components.  Creating a slider control  A slider is a control that allows a user to select a value within a given interval  without having to type it. It has a handle that can be displaced over a base line;   the position of the handler determines the selected value. The value is then used   to update other components of the page. In this section, we will create a slider with  D3 using the reusable chart pattern. We will include an API to change its visual  attributes and modify other elements when the slider value changes. Note that in  HTML5, we can create an input element of type range, which will be displayed as a  slider with configurable minimum and maximum steps and values. The type color  is also available, which allows us to use the native color picker. Native controls  include accessibility features and using the keyboard to control the slider. More  details on the input element can be found in https:  developer.mozilla.org en  docs Web HTML Element Input. To follow the examples of this section, open the  chapter04 01-slider.html file.  The final slider component   The drag behavior We will review how to use the drag behavior with a simple example. We will begin  by creating the svg element and put a gray circle in the center:     Width and height of the figure. var width = 600, height = 150;     Create the svg element. var svg = d3.select 'chart' .append 'svg'      .attr 'width', width      .attr 'height', height ;     Append a grey circle in the middle. var circle = svg.append 'circle'      .attr 'cx', width   2      .attr 'cy', height   2      .attr 'r', 30      .attr 'fill', '555' ;  This will create the svg and circle elements, but the circle can't be moved yet. D3  allows us to detect gestures on an element by using behaviors, which are functions  that create event listeners for gesture events on a container element. To detect the  drag gesture, we can use the drag behavior. The drag behavior detects dragging  events of three types, dragstart, drag, and dragend. We can create and configure  the drag behavior by adding event listeners for one or more drag events; in our case,  we will add a listener for the drag event as follows:     Create and configure a drag behavior. var drag = d3.behavior.drag  .on 'drag', dragListener ;  For more details on the D3 drag behavior, consult the D3 wiki page on this subject  at https:  github.com mbostock d3 wiki Drag-Behavior. To add the drag  behavior to the circle, we can call the drag function, passing the circle selection   to it or using the call method as follows:     Add dragging handling to the circle. circle.call drag ;  When the user drags the circle, the dragListener function will be invoked. The  dragListener function receives the data item bound to the circle  if any , with  the this context set to the container element, in our case, the circle element. In the  dragListener function, we will update the position of the circle. Note that the cx  and cy attributes are returned as strings, and prepending a plus sign will cast these  values to numbers. Refer to the following code:     Moves the circle on drag. function dragListener d  {  [ 74 ]          Get the current position of the circle     var cx = +d3.select this .attr 'cx' ,         cy = +d3.select this .attr 'cy' ;         Set the new position of the circle.     d3.select this          .attr 'cx', cx + d3.event.dx          .attr 'cy', cy + d3.event.dy ; }  The dragListener function updates the cx and cy attributes of the circle, but it can  change other attributes as well. It can even change properties of other elements. In  the next section, we will use the drag behavior to create a simple SVG slider.  Creating the slider The slider component will have a configurable width, domain, and a listener  function to be called on the slide. To use the slider, attach it to an svg group. As  the group can be translated, rotated, and scaled, the same slider can be displayed  horizontally, vertically, or even diagonally anywhere inside the SVG element. We  will implement the slider using the reusable chart pattern:  function sliderControl   {        Slider Attributes...         Charting function.     function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {                Create the slider elements...         } ;     }         Accessor Methods...      return chart; }  We will add attributes for width and domain, as well as their corresponding accessor  methods, chart.width and chart.domain. Remember that the accessor methods  should return the current value if they are invoked without arguments and return  the chart function if a value is passed as an argument:      function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {                Select the container group.  [ 75 ]               var group = d3.select this ;                 Create the slider content...         } ;     }  We will assume that the slider is created within an svg group, but we could have  detected the type of the container element and handle each case. If it were a div, for  instance, we could append an svg element and then append a group to it. We will  work with the group to keep things simple. We will create the base line using the   svg line element:                 Add a line covering the complete width.             group.selectAll 'line'                  .data [data]                  .enter  .append 'line'                  .call chart.initLine ;  We encapsulate the creation of the line in the chart.initLine method.   This function will receive a selection that contains the created line and sets   its position and other attributes:         Set the initial attributes of the line.     chart.initLine = function selection  {         selection             .attr 'x1', 2              .attr 'x2', width - 4              .attr 'stroke', '777              .attr 'stroke-width', 4              .attr 'stroke-linecap', 'round' ;     };  We set the x1 and x2 coordinates of the line. The default value for the coordinates  is zero, so we don't need to define the y1 and y2 coordinates. The stroke-linecap  attribute will make the ends of the line rounded, but we will need to adjust the x1  and x2 attributes to show the rounded corners. With a stroke width of 4 pixels, the  radius of the corner will be 2 pixels, which will be added in each edge of the line.   We will create a circle in the group in the same way:                 Append a circle as handler.             var handle = group.selectAll 'circle'                  .data [data]                  .enter  .append 'circle'                  .call chart.initHandle ;  [ 76 ]   The initHandle method will set the radius, fill color, stroke, and position of the  circle. The complete code of the function is available in the example file. We will  create a scale to map the value of the slider to the position of the circle:                 Set the position scale.             var posScale = d3.scale.linear                   .domain domain                  .range [0, width] ;  We correct the position of the circle, so its position represents the initial value of   the slider:                 Set the position of the circle.             handle                 .attr 'cx', function d  { return posScale d ; } ;  We have created the slider base line and handler, but the handle can't be moved yet.  We need to add the drag behavior to the circle:                 Create and configure the drag behavior.             var drag = d3.behavior.drag  .on 'drag', moveHandler ;                 Adds the drag behavior to the handler.             handler.call drag ;  The moveHandler listener will update only the horizontal position of the circle,  keeping the circle within the slider limits. We need to bind the value that we are  selecting to the handle  the circle , but the cx attribute will give us the position of the  handle in pixels. We will use the invert method to compute the selected value and  rebind this value to the circle so that it's available in the caller function:  function moveHandle d  {        Compute the future position of the handler     var cx = +d3.select this .attr 'cx'  + d3.event.dx;         Update the position if it's within its valid range.     if   0 < cx  &&  cx < width   {            Compute the new value and rebind the data         d3.select this .data [posScale.invert cx ]              .attr 'cx', cx ;     } }  [ 77 ]   To use the slider, we will append an SVG figure to the container div and set its width  and height:     Figure properties. var width = 600, height = 60, margin = 20;     Create the svg element and set its dimensions. var svg = d3.select 'chart' .append 'svg'      .attr 'width', width + 2 * margin      .attr 'height', height + 2 * margin ;  We can now create the slider function, setting its width and domain:     Valid range and initial value. var value = 70, domain = [0, 100];     Create and configure the slider control. var slider = sliderControl  .width width .domain domain ;  We create a selection for the container group, bind the data array that contains   the initial value, and append the group on enter. We also translate the group   to the location where we want the slider and invoke the slider function using   the call method:  var gSlider = svg.selectAll 'g'      .data [value]      .enter  .append 'g'      .attr 'transform', 'translate ' + [margin, height   2] + ' '      .call slider ;  We have translated the container group to have a margin, and we have centered it  vertically. The slider is now functional, but it doesn't update other components or  communicate changes in its value. Refer to the following screenshot:  The slider appended to an SVG group  [ 78 ]   We will add a user-configurable function that will be invoked when the user moves  the handler, along with its corresponding accessor function, so that the user can  define what should happen when the slider is changed:  function sliderControl   {        Slider attributes...         Default slider callback.     var onSlide = function selection  { };         Charting function...     function chart   {...}         Accessor Methods        Slide callback function     chart.onSlide = function onSlideFunction  {         if  !arguments.length  { return onSlide; }         onSlide = onSlideFunction;         return chart;     };      return chart; }  The onSlide function will be called on the drag listener function, passing the  handler selection as an argument. This way, the value of the slider will be passed   to the onSlide function as the bound data item of the selection argument:  function moveHandler d  {         Compute the new position of the handler     var cx = +d3.select this .attr 'cx'  + d3.event.dx;         Update the position within its valid range.     if   0 < cx  &&  cx < width   {            Compute the new value and rebind the data         d3.select this .data [posScale.invert cx ]              .attr 'cx', cx              .call onSlide ;     } }  Remember that the onSlide function should receive a selection, and through the  selection, it should receive the value of the slider. We will use the onSlide function  to change the color of a rectangle.  [ 79 ]   Using the slider We use the slider to change the color of a rectangle. We begin by creating the svg  element, setting its width, height, and margin:     Create the svg element var svg = d3.select 'chart' .append 'svg'      .attr 'width', width + 2 * margin      .attr 'height', height + 3 * margin ;  We create a linear color scale; its range will be the colors yellow and red. The domain  of the scale will be the same as that in the slider:     Create a color scale with the same range that the slider var cScale = d3.scale.linear       .domain domain      .range ['edd400', 'a40000'] ;  We add a rectangle in the svg, reserving some space in its upper side to put the slider  on top. We also set its width, height, and fill color:  We create the slider control and configure its attributes. The onSlide function will  change the rectangle fill color using the previously defined scale:     Add a background to the svg element. var rectangle = svg.append 'rect'      .attr 'x', margin      .attr 'y', 2 * margin      .attr 'width', width      .attr 'height', height      .attr 'fill', cScale value  ;     Create and configure the slider control. var slider = sliderControl       .domain domain      .width width      .onSlide function selection  {         selection.each function d  {             rectangle.attr 'fill', cScale d  ;         } ;     } ;  [ 80 ]   Finally, we append a group to contain the slider and translate it to put it above the  rectangle. We invoke the slider function using the call method:     Create a group to hold the slider and add the slider to it. var gSlider = svg.selectAll 'g' .data [value]      .enter  .append 'g'      .attr 'transform', 'translate ' + [margin, margin] + ' '      .call slider ;  Refer to the following screenshot:  The fill color of the rectangle is controlled by the slider  Creating a color picker  We will implement a color picker using the slider from the previous section. A color  picker is a UI control that allows the user to select a color. Usually, the color picker  is shown as a small, colored rectangle, and when the user clicks on it, a window  is opened with controls to change the color. To follow the code snippets, open the  chapter04 02-color-picker.html file. Refer to the following screenshot:  The color picker selector and window that uses the sliders from the previous section  We will implement the color picker using the reusable chart pattern. This will allow  us to modularize the components in two parts, the color picker selector and the color  picker window. We begin by creating the color picker selector.  [ 81 ]   The color picker selector The control element will be shown as a small rectangle. When the user clicks on the  rectangle, the color picker will appear, and clicking on the control again will set the  value. We will create a color picker using the CIELAB 1976 color model, which is  informally known as Lab. In this model, L is for lightness, and the a and b parameters  represent colors. This color model aims to be more perceptually uniform than other  models, which means that changes in the color value are perceived as changes of  about the same visual importance. We create the structure of the color picker using  the reusable chart pattern as follows:  function labColorPicker   {         Selector Attributes         Selector shape     var width = 30,         height = 10;         Default Color     var color = d3.lab 100, 0, 0 ;         Charting function     function chart selection  {         selection.each function   {                Creation of the color picker...         } ;     }         Width and height accessor methods...         Color Accessor     chart.color = function value  {         if  !arguments.length  { return color; }         color = d3.lab value ;         return chart;     };      return chart; }  [ 82 ]   The chart.color method receives a color in any format that can be converted by  d3.lab and returns the picker color as a d3.lab object with the current color of the  picker. We can also add accessors for the width and height  not shown for brevity .  To use the color picker, we need to create a container group for it and use the call  method to create the color selector:     Create the svg figure...     Create the color picker and set the initial color var picker = labColorPicker  .color 'a40000' ;     Create a group for the color picker and translate it. var grp = svg.append 'g'      .attr 'transform', 'translate ' + [offset, offset] + ' '      .call picker ;  We will translate the group to add a margin between the color picker selector and  the surrounding elements. In the charting function, we will create a selection with a  rectangle, bind the current color to that selection, and create the rectangle on enter:  function chart selection  {     selection.each function   {            Create the container group and rectangle         var group = d3.select this ,             rect = group.selectAll 'rect' ;             Bind the rectangle to the color item and set its            initial attributes.         rect.data [chart.color  ]              .enter  .append 'rect'              .attr 'width', width              .attr 'height', height              .attr 'fill', function d  { return d; }              .attr 'stroke', '222'              .attr 'stroke-width', 1 ;     } ; }  This will create the picker rectangle with the initial color.  [ 83 ]   Adding the color picker window The color picker window should show up if the color selector is clicked on and hide  it if the selector is clicked on a second time. We will use a div element to create the  color picker window:             Bind the rectangle to the data         rect.data [chart.color  ]              .enter  .append 'rect'                 set more attributes ...             .on 'click', chart.onClick ;  The openPicker function receives the data item bound to the rectangle. When the  user clicks on the rectangle, the openPicker function will be invoked. This method  will create the color picker window  a div  or remove it if already exists:  var openPicker = function d  {        Select the color picker div and bind the data.     var div = d3.select 'body' .selectAll 'div.color-picker'          .data [d] ;      if  div.empty    {            Create the container div, if it doesn't exist.         div.enter  .append 'div'              .attr 'class', 'color-picker' ;     } else {            Remove the color picker div, if it exists.         d3.select 'body' .selectAll 'div.color-picker'              .remove  ;     } };  Here, we detect whether the element exists using the empty method. If the selection  is empty, we create the div and set its attributes. If the selection is not empty, we  remove the color picker window. We want the color picker window to appear near  the rectangle; we will use the position of the pointer to locate the window to the  right-hand side of the selector. To position the color picker window, we need to set  its position to absolute, and set its top and left offsets to appropriate values. We also  set a provisional width, height, and background color for the div:     Create the container div, if it doesn't exist. div.enter  .append 'div'      .attr 'class', 'color-picker'      .style 'position', 'absolute'      .style 'left',  d3.event.pageX + width  + 'px'      .style 'top', d3.event.pageY + 'px'   [ 84 ]       .style 'width', '200px'      .style 'height', '100px'      .style 'background-color', 'eee' ;  We now have a div element that is displayed when the user clicks on it and   hidden when the user clicks again. Most importantly, the window div is bound   to the same data item as the rectangle, and the this context in the onClick method  is the rectangle node. We can now create the color picker window as a reusable chart  and bind it to the color picker selector.  The color picker window Let's review what we have done so far. The color picker has two parts: the color  picker selector and the color picker window. The color picker window is a div that  appears when the user clicks on the selector and disappears if the user clicks again.  We will use the reusable chart pattern to create the color picker window. Refer to the  following screenshot:  Components of the color picker; we will use the slider from the previous section  We can create the color picker content as an independent chart. For simplicity,   this time, we won't add the width, height, and margins as configurable attributes.  In this case, there are many elements that need to be created and positioned in the  figure; we will only show you the most important ones:  function labColorPickerWindow   {         Chart Attributes...     var margin = 10,            set more attributes...         width = 3 * margin + labelWidth + sliderWidth + squareSize,         height = 2 * margin + squareSize;      function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {                Select the container div and set its style             var divContent = d3.select this ;  [ 85 ]                  set the divContent size and position...                 Create the SVG Element             var svg = divContent.selectAll 'svg'                  .data [data]                  .enter  .append 'svg' ;                 set the svg width and height...                add more elements...         } ;     }      return chart; };  Again, we have used the basic structure of a reusable chart. Remember that in the  selection.each function, the data is the color of the selector, and the context is the  container div. We begin by adding the square that will show you the selected color:         Add the color square     var colorSquare = svg.append 'rect'          .attr 'x', 2 * margin + sliderWidth + labelWidth          .attr 'y', margin          .attr 'width', squareSize          .attr 'height', squareSize          .attr 'fill', data ;  This will put the square to the right-hand side of the window. Next, we will create a  scale to position each slider vertically. The rangePoints method of the scale allows  us to evenly distribute the sliders in the vertical space:         Scale to distribute the sliders vertically     var vScale = d3.scale.ordinal           .domain [0, 1, 2]          .rangePoints [0, squareSize], 1 ;  We will use this scale to set the position of the groups that will contain the slider  elements for each color component. We create a slider for the l component of the color:  var sliderL = sliderControl       .domain [0, 100]      .width sliderWidth ;     .onSlide function selection  {         selection.each function d  {             data.l = d;             updateColor data ;         } ;     } ;  [ 86 ]   The l component of the color is updated on the slider, and then the updateColor  function is invoked, passing the color as the argument. We add a group to display  the slider and translate it to the appropriate location. Remember that the data bound  to the group is the value that is changed when the user moves the handler:  var gSliderL = svg.selectAll 'g.slider-l'      .data [data.l]      .enter  .append 'g'      .attr 'transform', function   {         var dx = margin + labelWidth,             dy = margin + vScale 0 ;         return 'translate ' + [dx, dy] + ' ';     }      .call sliderL ;  This will create the first slider. In a similar way, we add a slider for the a and b  color components with its corresponding groups. When the user moves the slider,  the square and the rectangle in the selector should get updated. This chart is  independent of the color picker selector to which we don't have access to the selector  rectangle in this scope. We will add a configurable method that will be invoked  on color change, so the user of labColorWindow can update other components.  The updateColor function will update the color of the square and invoke the  onColorChange function:     Update the color square and invoke onColorChange function updateColor color  {     colorSquare.attr 'fill', color ;     divContent.data [color] .call onColorChange ; }  Note that the color is bound to the color picker window div, and onColorChange  receives the selection that contains the window. We need to add a default function  and an accessor to configure this function. The default function will be just an empty  function. We can now update the color picker selector, more precisely, the onClick  method, to create the color picker window as follows:  chart.onClick = function d  {        Select the picker rectangle     var rect = d3.select this ;         Select the color picker div and bind the data...     if  div.empty    {            Create the Color Picker Content         var content = labColorPickerWindow               .onColorChange function selection  {  [ 87 ]                   selection.each function d  {                     rect.data [d] .attr 'fill', d ;                 } ;             } ;             Create the container div, if it doesn't exist.         div.enter  .append 'div'              .attr 'class', 'color-picker'                 set more attributes....             .call content ;             Bind the data to the rectangle again.         rect.data [div.datum  ] ;     } else {            Update the color of the rectangle         rect.data [div.datum  ]              .attr 'fill', function d  { return d; } ;             Remove the color picker window.         d3.select 'body'              .selectAll 'div.color-picker' .remove  ;     } };  We can now select a color using the color picker. There is only one thing missing;  the user will want to do something with the color once it has been changed. We will  add an onChangeColor function and its corresponding accessor to the color picker  window and invoke it at the end of the chart.onClick method. With this function,  the user will be able to use the color to change other components:  To use the color picker, we need to attach it to a selection that contains a group and  configure the onColorChange function:  chart.onClick = function d  {        ...         Invoke the user callback.     onColorChange color ; };     Create the color picker var picker = labColorPicker       .color 'fff      .onColorChange function d  {  [ 88 ]              Change the background color of the page         d3.select 'body' .style 'background-color', d ;     } ;     Create a group for the color picker and translate it. var grp = svg.append 'g'      .attr 'transform', 'translate 30, 30 '      .call picker ;  This will change the background color of the example page when the user selects a  color. In this section, we have used the slider components to create a color picker.  The color picker has two independent components: the selector and the color picker  window. The color picker selector creates an instance of the color picker window  when the user clicks on it and removes the window container when the user clicks  on it again.  Summary  In this chapter, we used the drag behavior and the reusable chart pattern to create a  slider control. This control can be used to allow users to select values within a range.  We used the slider component to create a color picker for the Lab color space. In the  implementation of the color picker, we didn't need to know about the internals of the  slider; we only used the slider's public interface. The composition between reusable  components allows us to create rich components without having to handle the  details of their internal elements.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to create tooltips for our charts and how   to implement more advanced user interface components. We will also create an   area chart that allows us to measure variations between two points in the chart   by using brushing.  [ 89 ]    Creating User   Interface Elements  In the previous chapter, we learned how to use the drag behavior and SVG elements  to create reusable controls and user interface elements. In this chapter, we will learn  how to create additional elements to complement our projects. When designing  data visualizations, screen real estate is one of the scarcest resources; we need to  get the most out of our pixels without cluttering the screen. One of the strategies to  solve this problem is to add contextual user interface elements, allowing the user to  request any additional information in a quick and nonintrusive way. A tooltip does  just that: it displays additional information about an item without cluttering the  entire visualization.  If the page has a large number of elements, the user can lose track of the important  parts of the visualization or have difficulties in tracking individual elements. One  solution is to highlight the important elements, so we can guide the users' attention  to the most relevant elements in the page.  In this chapter, we will learn how to highlight elements and create reusable tooltips.  We will also create a chart with a brushing control, which will allow us to select an  interval and display additional information about that interval.  Highlighting chart elements  We will create a simple chart depicting a series of circles that represent fruits and   the number of calories we can get from 100 grams of each fruit. To make things  easier, we have created a JSON file with information about the fruits. The file  structure is as follows:  {   "name": "Fruits",     "data": [     {       "name": "Apple",       "description": "The apple is the pomaceous fruit..."       "amount_grams": 100,       "calories": 52,       "color": "FF5149"     },     ...   ] }  We will represent each fruit with a circle and arrange them horizontally. We will  map the area of the circle to the calories by serving, coloring them with the color  indicated in the data item. As usual, we will use the reusable chart pattern, creating  a closure function with the chart attributes and a charting function that contains the  rendering logic, as shown in the following code:  function fruitChart   {         Chart Attributes     var width = 600,         height = 120;         Radius Extent     var radiusExtent = [0, 40];         Charting Function     function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {                charting function content ...         } ;     }         Accessor Methods...      return chart; }  [ 92 ]   Although it is unlikely that we will reuse the fruit chart, the reusable chart structure  is still useful because it encapsulates the chart variables and we get cleaner code. In  the charting function, we select the div container, create the svg element, and set its  width and height, as follows:     Charting Function function chart selection  {     selection.each function data  {             Select the container div and create the svg selection         var div = d3.select this ,         svg = div.selectAll 'svg' .data [data] ;             Append the svg element on enter         svg.enter  .append 'svg' ;             Update the width and height of the SVG element         svg.attr 'width', width .attr 'height', height ;             add more elements...     } ; }  We want to have the circles evenly distributed in the horizontal dimension. To  achieve this, we will use an ordinal scale to compute the position of each circle,   as shown in the following code:     Create a scale for the horizontal position var xScale = d3.scale.ordinal       .domain d3.range data.length       .rangePoints [0, width], 1 ;  The rangePoints method will configure the scale, dividing the [0,width] range  into the number of elements in the domain. The second argument allows you to add  padding, expressed as a multiple of the distance between two items. We will also  add a scale for the radius, mapping the number of calories to the area of the circle.  As discussed earlier, the area of the circle should be proportional to the quantitative  dimensions that we are representing:     Maximum number of calories var maxCal = d3.max data, function d  {      return d.calories; } ;     Create the radius scale  [ 93 ]   var rScale = d3.scale.sqrt       .domain [0, maxCal]      .rangeRound radiusExtent ;  We will create groups and translate them to the location where we want the circles  and labels. We will append the circles and labels to the groups, as follows:     Create a container group for each circle var gItems = svg.selectAll 'g.fruit-item' .data data      .enter       .append 'g'      .attr 'class', 'fruit-item'      .attr 'transform', function d, i  {         return 'translate ' + [xScale i , height   2] + ' ';     } ;  We can now append the circle, the label that displays the fruit name, and another  label that shows the number of calories per serving. We will set the style of the labels  to align them to the center and set the font size for the labels:     Add a circle to the item group var circles = gItems.append 'circle'      .attr 'r', function d  { return rScale d.calories ; }      .attr 'fill', function d  { return d.color; } ;     Add the fruit name var labelName = gItems.append 'text'      .attr 'text-anchor', 'middle'      .attr 'font-size', '12px'      .text function d  { return d.name; } ;     Add the calories label var  labelKCal = gItems.append 'text'      .attr 'text-anchor', 'middle'      .attr 'font-size', '10px'      .attr 'y', 12      .text function d  { return d.calories + ' kcal'; } ;  We can use the chart at this point. We load the JSON file, create and configure the  fruit chart, select the div container, and call the chart, passing the selection as an  argument, as shown in the following code:     Load and parse the json data d3.json ' chapter05 fruits.json', function error, root  {         Display the error message   [ 94 ]       if  error  {         console.error 'Error getting or parsing the data.' ;         throw error;      }         Create and configure the chart     var fruits = fruitChart  ;      d3.select 'divchart'          .data [root.data]          .call fruits ; } ;  We obtained a series of circles where each one represents a fruit, but without any  highlighting yet.  The first draft of the chart, without any highlighting  We will highlight the circles when the pointer moves over the circles by changing the  background color to a brighter color of the same hue and by adding a small border,  returning the circles to their original state when the mouse leaves the element.  The DOM API allows you to bind listeners for events to individual elements, but  the selection.on method allows you to apply a listener to all the elements in a  selection at the same time. As in almost every D3 operator, the this context is set  to the selected element in the listener function. The d3.rgb function constructs a  RGB color from the hexadecimal string. The brighter   method returns a brighter  version of the color. The method receives an optional parameter, k, which can be  used to specify the increment of brightness. The default value is 1, and the brightness  is increased by multiplying each channel by 0.7^-k. We will use this method to  highlight the circles on a mouseover event:     We add listeners to the mouseover and mouseout events circles     .on 'mouseover', function d  {         d3.select this              .attr 'stroke-width', 3              .attr 'fill', d3.rgb d.color .brighter                .attr 'stroke', d.color ;     }   [ 95 ]       .on 'mouseout', function d  {         d3.select this              .attr 'stroke-width', 0              .attr 'fill', d.color ;     } ;  The elements are now highlighted when the user moves the pointer over the circles.  The highlighted element is brighter and has a small border  This is a very simple example, but the method to highlight elements is the same in  bigger charts. There are other strategies to highlight elements; for instance, a highlight  class can be added or removed when the user moves the cursor over the elements.  This strategy is particularly useful when we don't want to hardcode the styles.  Creating tooltips A tooltip is a small element that provides contextual information when the user  locates the pointer over an element. This allows you to provide details without  cluttering the visualization. In this section, we will create the tooltip as a reusable  chart but with a different structure than that in the previous examples. In the  previous charts, we bound the data to a selection of containers for the charts; while  in this case, the tooltip chart will be bound to the element on which the tooltip  should appear. This implies that the selection argument in the charting function  contains the elements on which the tooltip will appear. In the case of the fruit chart,  we will want the tooltip to appear when the user moves the pointer over the circles,  follow the pointer as it moves over the circle, and disappear when the pointer leaves  the circle. We will create a tooltip as a reusable chart, but instead of invoking the  tooltip on a selection of containers, we will invoke the tooltip passing it a selection  containing the circle under the cursor. We begin by creating the tooltip chart, bearing  in mind these considerations:  function tooltipChart   {         Tooltip Attributes...         Charting function     function chart selection  {  [ 96 ]           selection.each function d  {                Bind the mouse events to the container element             d3.select this                  .on 'mouseover', create                   .on 'mousemove', move                  .on 'mouseout',  remove ;         } ;     }         Accessor methods...      return chart; }  Here, we added listeners for the mouseover, mousemove, and mouseout events on the  selection argument. The data bound to each element will be passed on to the create,  move, and remove listeners. These functions will create, move, and remove the tooltip,  respectively. To create the tooltip, we will create a div container under the body  element and set its left and top offsets to the pointer position, plus we add a small  offset, as shown in the following code:     Create the tooltip chart var create = function data  {         Create the tooltip container div     var tooltipContainer = d3.select 'body' .append 'div'          .datum data          .attr 'class', 'tooltip-container'          .call init ;         Move the tooltip to its initial position     tooltipContainer         .style 'left',  d3.event.pageX + offset.x  + 'px'          .style 'top',  d3.event.pageY + offset.y  + 'px' ; };  To locate the tooltip near the pointer, we need to set its position to absolute. The  pointer events' style must be set to none so that the tooltip doesn't capture the mouse  events. We set the position and other style attributes in an inline style element. We  also set the style for the tooltip's title and content, as shown in the following code:    .tooltip-container {     position: absolute;     pointer-events: none;  [ 97 ]       padding: 2px 4px 2px 6px;     background-color: eee;     border: solid 1px aaa; }  .tooltip-title {     text-align: center;     font-size: 12px;     font-weight: bold;     line-height: 1em; }  .tooltip-content {     font-size: 11px; }    In the initialization function, we will create the div container for the tooltip and  add paragraphs for the title and the content. We also added the title and content  methods with their corresponding accessors so that the user can configure the title  and content based on the bound data:     Initialize the tooltip var init = function selection  {     selection.each function data  {            Create and configure the tooltip container         d3.select this              .attr 'class', 'tooltip-container'              .style 'width', width + 'px' ;             Tooltip Title         d3.select this .append 'p'              .attr 'class', 'tooltip-title'              .text title data  ;             Tooltip Content         d3.select this .append 'p'              .attr 'class', 'tooltip-content'              .text content data  ;     } ; };  [ 98 ]   The chart.move method will update the position of the tooltip as the pointer moves,  changing its left and top offsets. The chart.remove method will just remove the  tooltip from the document:     Move the tooltip to follow the pointer var move = function   {        Select the tooltip and move it following the pointer     d3.select 'body' .select 'div.tooltip-container'          .style 'left',  d3.event.pageX + offset.x  + 'px'          .style 'top',  d3.event.pageY + offset.y  + 'px' ; };     Remove the tooltip var remove = function   {     d3.select 'div.tooltip-container' .remove  ; };  Using the tooltip We can use the tooltip in the fruit chart, and add tooltips when the user moves the  pointer over the circles. We will create and configure the tooltip function in the  fruit chart closure, as follows:  function fruitChart   {         Create and configure the tooltip     var tooltip = tooltipChart           .title function d  { return d.name; }          .content function d  { return d.description; } ;         Attributes, charting function and accessors...      return chart; }  In the charting function, we can invoke the tooltip function by passing the  selection of the circles as an argument, as follows:  function fruitChart   {         Chart attributes...         Charting Function     function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {  [ 99 ]                  Charting function content...                 The event listeners of the tooltip should be                 namespaced to avoid overwriting the listeners of the                  circles.             circles                 .on 'mouseover', function d  { ... }                  .on 'mouseout', function d  { ... }                  .call tooltip ;         } ;     }         Accessor methods....      return chart; }  Remember that the circles already have listeners for the  mouseover and mouseout events. If we add the tooltip as it  is, the first listener will be removed before the new listener is  added, disabling the highlighting.  To register multiple listeners for the same event type, we can add an optional  namespace to the tooltip-related events, as follows:     Tooltip charting function function chart selection  {     selection.each function d  {            Bind the mouse events to the container element         d3.select this              .on 'mouseover.tooltip', create              .on 'mousemove.tooltip', move              .on 'mouseout.tooltip',  remove ;     } ; }  [ 100 ]   Now, we have the tooltips and highlighting enabled in the fruit chart.  The tooltip and the highlighting listeners are enabled for the fruit chart  Selecting a range with brushing  In this section, we will create an area chart to display stock prices and use   brushing to allow the user to select an interval and get additional information   about that time interval.  Selecting a time interval with brushing  [ 101 ]   We will use the time series of the prices of the AAPL stock, available as a TSV file  in the D3 examples gallery. The file contains the date and closing price for the date,  covering almost 5 years of activity, as shown in the following code:  date        close 1-May-12    582.13 30-Apr-12   583.98 27-Apr-12   603.00 26-Apr-12   607.70 ...  Creating the area chart We begin by creating the structure of a reusable chart; we will add the width,  height, and margin as the chart attributes, and add their corresponding accessors.  The complete code is available in the chapter05 02-brushing.html file. In the  charting function, we initialize and set the size of the svg element as follows:     Chart Creation function chart selection  {     selection.each function data  {             Select the container element and create the svg selection         var div = d3.select this ,             svg = div.selectAll 'svg' .data [data] ;             Initialize the svg element         svg.enter  .append 'svg'              .call svgInit ;             Initialize the svg element         svg.attr 'width', width .attr 'height', height ;             Creation of the inner elements...     } ; }  The svgInit function will be called only on enter, and it will create groups for the axis  and the chart content. We will parse the input data, so we don't have to transform each  item later. To parse the date, we will use the d3.time.format D3 method:     Configure the time parser var parseDate = d3.time.format timeFormat .parse;     Parse the data  [ 102 ]   data.forEach function d  {     d.date = parseDate d.date ;     d.close = +d.close; } ;  The timeFormat variable is defined as a chart attribute; we also added an accessor  function so that the user can use the chart for other datasets. In this case, the input  date format is %d-%b-%y, that is, the day, abbreviated month name, and year.   We can now create the x and y axis:     Create the scales and axis var xScale = d3.time.scale       .domain d3.extent data, function d  { return d.date; }       .range [0, width - margin.left - margin.right] ;     Create the x axis var xAxis = d3.svg.axis       .scale xScale      .orient 'bottom' ;     Invoke the xAxis function on the corresponding group svg.select 'g.xaxis' .call xAxis ;  We do the same with the y axis, but we will use a linear scale instead of the time  scale and orient the axis to the left side. We can now create the chart content; we  create and configure an area generator that will compute the path and then append  the path to the chart group, as follows:     Create and configure the area generator var area = d3.svg.area       .x function d  { return xScale d.date ; }      .y0 height - margin.top - margin.bottom      .y1 function d  { return yScale d.close ; } ;     Create the area path svg.select 'g.chart' .append "path"      .datum data      .attr "class", "area"      .attr "d", area ;  [ 103 ]   We will modify the styles for the classes of the axis groups and the area to have a  better-looking chart, as follows:    .axis path, line{     fill: none;     stroke: 222;     shape-rendering: crispEdges; } .axis text {     font-size: 11px; }  .area {     fill: ddd; }    We load the dataset using the d3.tsv function, which retrieves and parses tabular  delimited data. Next, we will configure the chart, select the container element, and  bind the dataset to the selection as follows:     Load the TSV Stock Data d3.tsv ' chapter05 aapl.tsv', function error, data  {         Handle errors getting or parsing the data     if  error  {         console.error error ;         throw error;     }         Create and configure the area chart     var chart = areaChart  ;         Bind the chart to the container div     d3.select 'divchart'          .datum data          .call chart ; } ;  [ 104 ]   The first version of the area chart  Adding brushing A brush is a control that allows you to select a range in a chart. D3 provides built-in  support for brushing. We will use brushing to select time intervals in our area chart,  and use it to show the price and date of the edges of the selected interval. We will  also add a label that shows the relative price variation in the interval. We will create  an SVG group to contain the brush elements. We will add this group in the svgInit  method, as follows:     Create and translate the brush container group svg.append 'g'      .attr 'class', 'brush'      .attr 'transform', function   {         var dx = margin.left, dy = margin.top;         return 'translate ' + [dx, dy] + ' ';     } ;  The group should be added at the end of the svg element to avoid getting it hidden  by the other elements. With the group created, we can add the brush control in the  charting function as follows:  function chart selection  {     selection.each function data  {            Charting function contents...             Create and  configure the brush  [ 105 ]           var brush = d3.svg.brush               .x xScale              .on 'brush', brushListener ;     } ; }  We set the scale of the brush in the horizontal axis, and add a listener for the   brush event. The brush can be configured to select a vertical interval by setting   the y attribute with an appropriate scale and even be used to select areas by setting  both the x and y attributes. The brushListener function will be invoked if the brush extent changes. The  brushstart and brushend events are also available, but we don't need to use   them at the moment. In the following code, we apply the brush function to the   brush group using the call method of the selection:  var gBrush = svg.select 'g.brush' .call brush ;  When we invoke the brush function in a group, a series of elements are created. A  background rectangle will capture the brush events. There will also be a rectangle of  the extent class, which will resize as the user changes the brush area. Also, there are  two invisible vertical rectangles at the brush edges; so, it's easier for the user to select  the brush boundary. The rectangles will initially have zero height; we will set the  height to cover the chart area:     Change the height of the brushing rectangle gBrush.selectAll 'rect'      .attr 'height', height - margin.top - margin.bottom ;  We will modify the extent class, so the selected region is visible. We will set its color  to gray and set the fill opacity to 0.05.  Adding brushing to the chart  [ 106 ]   The brush listener We will add lines to mark the prices at the beginning and end of the selected period,  and add a label to display the price variation in the interval. We begin by adding the  elements in the chart.svgInit function and set some of its attributes. We will create  groups for the line markers and for the text elements that will display the price and  date. We also add a text element for the price variation. We create the brushListener  function in the charting function scope, as shown in the following code:     Brush Listener function function brushListener   {     var s = d3.event.target.extent  ;         Filter the items within the brush extent     var items = data.filter function d  {         return  s[0] <= d.date  &&  d.date<= s[1] ;     } ; }  When the brush event is triggered, the brush listener will have access to the event  attributes through the d3.event object. Here, we get the brush extent and use it  to filter the dates that lie within the selected interval. Note that the selection is an  approximation, because there are a limited number of pixels in the screen. At the  beginning of the brush event, the time interval might be too small to contain data  items. We will compute the prices only when at least two items have been selected.  We then select the first and last elements of the item array, as follows:     Compute the percentual variation of the period if  items.length > 2  {        Get the prices in the period     priceB = items[0].close;     priceA = Math.max items[n - 1].close, 1e-8 ;         Set the lines and text position... }  [ 107 ]   Having the first and last elements of the selected period, we can compute the  relative price variation and set the position of the marker lines and labels. We will  also set the color of the variation label to blue if the variation is positive and to red  if it's negative. As the configuration of the positions and labels is rather large, we  won't include the code here. However, the code is available in the chapter05 02- brushing.html file for reference.  The area chart with brushing and annotations  Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to highlight elements when a user moves the pointer  over them, making it easier for the user to spot the elements under the cursor and  give hints of which elements can provide additional interactions. We created a  reusable tooltip component that can be configured and used in other charts.  We also learned how to use the built-in brush component to create a control in order  to select intervals, and used this control to allow the user to select a time interval  in an area chart. We used the brush area to further annotate the chart with useful  information about variations and the edges of the selected time interval.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to add interaction between chart components  and how to integrate D3 and Backbone to create complex applications.  [ 108 ]   Interaction between Charts  Visualization projects are usually implemented as single page applications. Single  page applications usually load their code when the browser loads the page and make  requests to retrieve additional data when the user interacts with the page, avoiding  full page reloads. The application can be used while the request is fulfilled, thereby  improving the user experience.  Single page applications generally have a single payload that retrieves the   scripts, styles, and markup required to create the interface. When the user   interacts with UI components and additional data is required, the client-side   code makes asynchronous requests to the server in the background and updates   the corresponding elements when the data is ready, allowing the user to continue  using the application during the request.  This increase in the complexity of client-side applications has led frontend developers  to improve the architecture of client-side components. One of the most successful  designs to face these challenges is the MVC pattern and its many variations. In this chapter, we will cover the basics of the Backbone library and use D3 with  Backbone to create a stock explorer with several components interacting between  them, maintaining a consistent visualization state. We will also learn how to update  the application URL to reflect a particular state in the application, allowing users to  create bookmarks, navigate, and share the application state.   Learning the basics of Backbone Backbone is a JavaScript library that helps us structure applications by implementing  a version of the MV* pattern, which helps us separate different application concerns.  The main Backbone components include models, collections, views, and routers;   all these components communicate among themselves by triggering and listening   to events.  The only hard dependency of Backbone is Underscore, which is a small utility library  that provides functional programming support for collections, arrays, functions, and  objects. It also provides additional utilities, such as a small template engine, which  we will use later. To use the Backbone router and manipulate the DOM, jQuery or  Zepto must also be included.  Events The Events module can be used to extend an object, giving it the ability to listen and  trigger custom events, such as listening for key presses, or sending an event when  a variable changes. Backbone models, views, collections, and routers have event  support. When we include Backbone in a page, the Backbone object will be available,  and it can be used to listen or trigger events.  Models In Backbone, a model is a data container. Model instances can be created, validated,  and persisted to a server endpoint. When an attribute of the model is set, the model  triggers a change event. The granularity of the change events allows observers to  listen for a change in a particular attribute or any attribute in the model.  Besides being data containers, models can validate or convert data from its original  format. Models are ignorant of views or external objects observing its changes; a  model only communicates when its attributes are changed.  Collections Collections are ordered sets of models, which are useful in order to manage   model instances as a set. If a model instance in the collection is modified  added or  removed , the collection will trigger a change event  triggering the add and remove  events in each case .  [ 110 ]   Collections also have a series of enumerable methods that are useful to iterate,   find, group, and compute aggregate functions on the collection elements. Of course,  collections can be also extended to add new methods. Collections can be synced to  the server in order to retrieve records and create new model instances from them and  to push model instances created within the application.  Views The views are components that render one or more attributes of a model in the  page. Each view has one DOM element bound to it and a corresponding model  or  collection  instance. Usually, the views listen for changes in one or more attributes  of a model. Views can be updated from each other independently when a model   or some attributes of a model  changes, updating the view without redrawing the  entire page. Note that when using Backbone models and views, the DOM elements  in a view don't have references to the corresponding data elements; the view stores  references to the DOM elements and the model. In D3, the DOM element contains a  reference to the data bound to it.  Views also listen for DOM elements inside the container element. We can bind DOM  events in a child element to a view method. For instance, if a view contains a button,  we can bind the click event of the button with the custom toggleClicked method  of the view. This is commonly used to update a model attribute.  In most Backbone applications, the views are rendered using templates. In most  of the views, we will use D3 to render them instead of templates, but we will also  include an example of a view that has been rendered using Underscore templates.  Routers The Backbone router allows you to connect URLs to the application, allowing the  application states to have URLs. This allows the user to navigate between visited  application states using the browser's back and forth buttons, save a bookmark,   and share specific application states.  Backbone is a subject on its own and we can't cover all its features in one chapter.   It's a good idea to invest some time learning Backbone or one of its alternatives.  [ 111 ]   There are a great number of resources available to help you learn  Backbone. The most complete references are the following:     Backbone Fundamentals  http:  addyosmani.github.  io backbone-fundamentals : This book, written by Addy  Osmani, describes the Backbone components in depth and has  two complete examples of Backbone-based applications.     Backbone  http:  backbonejs.org : The official website  contains the documentation of the library. The source code of  Backbone is also extensively commented on.     TodoMVC  http:  todomvc.com : As the number of   JavaScript MV* frameworks and libraries that allow you to  structure an application can be overwhelming, the TodoMVC  project contains the same Todo application that was implemented  in the most popular MV* JavaScript frameworks available.  The stock explorer application  In this section, we will use D3 and Backbone to create a single page application to  display a time series of stock prices. The user will be able to select different stocks and  a period of time in order to get a detail view. The page will have several components:     Context chart: This chart will display the complete series of prices that   are available for the stock. It will have a brush component that selects   a time interval.     Detail chart: This will be a bigger area chart that will show you the stock   prices for the time interval selected in the context chart.     Control view: This view will show you a control that selects the stock.    Stock title: This will display the name of the company.  We will display the control and title view on top of the page, a big area with the  detail view, and a context area chart at the bottom of the page.  [ 112 ]   A diagram of the application components  As you can see, there are several components that should be in sync. If we change the  stock, the area chart should be updated. If we change the time interval in the context  chart, the detail chart must be updated to show you only the selected period. We will  use Backbone to structure this application.  The state of our application can be described by the stock and the time interval that  we want to examine. We will create a model to store the application state and one  view for each component.  The general strategy is that each view will contain an instance of  a D3-based chart, which is created following the reusable chart  pattern. In the initialize method, we will tell the view to listen  for changes in the model and invoke the render method when  one of the model attributes is changed. In the render method of  the view, we will create a selection for the container element of the  view, bind the data corresponding to the selected stock, and invoke  the charting function using the selection.call method. We  will begin by creating reusable charts with D3.  [ 113 ]   Creating the stock charts In this section, we will implement the charts that will be used by the application.  This time, the code of the charts will be in a separated JavaScript file. To follow the  examples in this section, open the chapter06 stocks js lib stockcharts.js   and chapter06 01-charts.html files.  We will begin by creating the stock title chart and then implement the stock area  chart, which we will be using in the context and detail views. Note that the title chart  is not really necessary, but it will be helpful to introduce the pattern that integrates  reusable charts and Backbone.  The stock title chart The stock title chart is a reusable chart that creates a paragraph with the title of the  stock. As we mentioned previously, it's probably not a good idea to create a chart  just to write a string, but it shows you how to integrate a reusable chart that doesn't  involve SVG with Backbone. It has a configurable title accessor function, so the user  can define the content of the paragraph using the data that is bound to the container  selection. The chart is structured using the reusable chart pattern, as shown in the  following code:  function stockTitleChart   {     'use strict';         Default title accessor     var title = function d  { return d.title; };         Charting function     function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {                Creation and update of the paragraph...         } ;     }         Title function accessor     chart.title = function titleAccessor  {         if  !arguments.length  { return title; }         title = titleAccessor;         return chart;     };      return chart; }  [ 114 ]   In the charting function, we select the div element and create a selection for the  paragraph. We add the stock-title class to the paragraph in order to allow the  user to modify its style, as shown in the following code:         Charting function     function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {                 Create the selection for the title             var div = d3.select this ,                 par = div.selectAll 'p.stock-title' .data [data] ;                 Create the paragraph element on enter             par.enter  .append 'p'                  .attr 'class', 'stock-title'  ;                 Update the paragraph content             par.text title ;         } ;     }  As usual, we can use the chart by creating and configuring a chart instance,   selecting the container element, binding the data, and invoking the chart using   the selection.call method, as shown in the following code:     Create and configure the title chart var titleChart = stockTitleChart       .title function d  { return d.name; } ;     Select the container element, bind the data and invoke    the charting function on the selection d3.select 'divchart'      .data [{name: 'Apple Inc.'}]      .call titleChart ;  The stock area chart The stock area chart will display the time series for the stock price as an area chart.  In Chapter 5, Creating User Interface Elements, we implemented an area chart that uses  the brush behavior to select a time interval and annotate the chart with additional  information about the price variation in the period. We will create an improved  version of this chart and use it in the stock explorer application.  [ 115 ]   Besides having the usual width, height, and margin attributes and accessors  methods, this chart will have an optional axis, brush behavior, and a configurable  brush listener function so that the user can define actions to be performed on the  brush. The time extent can be also be configured, allowing the user to show only   part of the chart.  We have added all these methods so that we can use two chart instances for different  purposes: one to allow the user to select a time interval and another to display the  selected time interval in more detail. In the chapter06 01-charts.html file, we  created one instance in order to select the time interval:      var contextAreaChart = stockAreaChart           .height 60          .value function d  { return d.price; }          .yaxis false          .onBrushListener function extent  {             console.log extent ;         } ;  We will use the chart accessor methods to set the height, disable the y axis, and set  the value accessor and the brush listener functions. In this case, the brush listener  function will display the time extent in the browser console on brush.  A stock area chart with the brush behavior enabled  We will use a second instance of the same chart to display a specific time interval.  In this instance, we will disable the brush control and set the initial time extent, the  value, and the date accessors. This chart will display the stock prices between the  from and to dates:     Set the time extent var from = new Date '2002 01 01' ,     to = new Date '2004 12 31' ;     Create and configure the detail area chart var detailAreaChart = stockAreaChart       .value function d  { return d.price; }      .date function d  { return new Date d.date ; }      .timeExtent [from, to]      .brush false ;  [ 116 ]   As you have probably guessed, the first instance is intended to control the time  extent of the second chart instance. We will get to that soon; in the meantime,   we will discuss some implications of controlling the time extent of the chart.  A stock area chart with the y-axis enabled and the brush behavior disabled  If we change the time extent of the chart, we will want the chart to reflect its new  state. If the brush is dragged left in the first chart, we will want the area of the second  chart to move to the right-hand side until it matches the interval selected in the first  chart, and if we shorten the time interval in the first chart, we will want the area  of the second chart to compress itself to display the selected interval in the same  horizontal space.  The stock area chart will be implemented as a reusable chart. As most of the chart  structure is similar to the chart presented in the previous section, we will skip some  parts for brevity:  function stockAreaChart   {     'use strict';         Chart Attributes     var width = 700,         height = 300,         margin = {top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20};         Time Extent     var timeExtent;         The axis and brush are enabled by default     var yaxis = true,         xaxis = true,  [ 117 ]           brush = true;         Default accessor functions     var date = function d  { return new Date d.date ; };     var value = function d  { return +d.value; };         Default brush listener     var onBrush = function extent  {};      function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {                Charting function contents...         } ;     }      var svgInit = function selection  { ... };         Accessor Methods...      return chart; }  In order to have the detail chart moving in sync with the context chart, we will  need to draw the complete series in the detail chart but only displaying the interval  selected with the brush in the context chart. To prevent the area chart from being  visible outside the charting area, we will define a clip path, and only the content  inside the clipping path will be visible:  var svgInit = function selection  {        Define the clipping path     selection.append 'defs'          .append 'clipPath'          .attr 'id', 'clip'          .append 'rect'          .attr 'width', width - margin.left - margin.right          .attr 'height', height - margin.top - margin.bottom ;         Create the chart and axis groups... };  [ 118 ]   The element that will be clipped should reference the clipping path using the   clip-path attribute. In the charting function, we select the container element and  create the SVG element on enter. We also set the SVG element's width and height  and translate the axis, chart, and brush groups. We create the scales and axis  if they  are enabled  and create and configure the area generator to draw the chart area path:                 Charting function...                Add the axes             if  xaxis  { svg.select 'g.xaxis' .call xAxis ; }             if  yaxis  { svg.select 'g.yaxis' .call yAxis ; }                 Area Generator             var area = d3.svg.area                   .x function d  { return xScale date d  ; }                  .y0 yScale 0                   .y1 function d  { return yScale value d  ; } ;  We create a selection for the path and bind the time series array to the selection.   We append the path on enter and set its class to stock-area. We set the path data  using the area generator and set the clip-path attribute using the clipPath variable  defined previously:                 Create the path selection             var path = svg.select 'g.chart' .selectAll 'path'                  .data [data] ;                 Append the path element on enter             path.enter  .append 'path'                  .attr 'class', 'stock-area' ;                 Set the path data string and clip the area             path.attr 'd', area                  .attr 'clip-path', 'url clip ' ;  We create an envelope brush listener function. In this function, we retrieve the brush  extent and invoke the user-configurable onBrush function, passing the extent as an  argument. We initialize the brush behavior and bind the brushListener function to  the brush event:                 Brush Listener Function             function brushListener   {                 timeExtent = d3.event.target.extent  ;                 onBrush timeExtent ;             }                 Brush Behavior  [ 119 ]               var brushBehavior = d3.svg.brush                   .x xScale                  .on 'brush', brushListener ;  The initial time extent of the chart can be configured. If that's the case, we update the  brush behavior extent, so the brush overlay fits the configured time extent:                 Set the brush extent to the time extent             if  timeExtent  {                  brushBehavior.extent timeExtent ;              }  We call the brush behavior using the selection.call method on the brush group  and set the overlay height:              if  brush  {                 svg.select 'g.brush' .call brushBehavior ;                     Change the height of the brushing rectangle                 svg.select 'g.brush' .selectAll 'rect'                      .attr 'height', h ;             }  The preceding charts are implemented following the reusable chart pattern and were  created with D3 only. We will use the charts in a Backbone application, but they can  be used in other applications as standalone charts.  Preparing the application structure In Backbone projects, it is a common practice to create directories for the models,  views, collections, and routers. In the Chapter06 directory, we created the stocks  directory to hold the files for this application:  stocks      css      js          views          models          collections          routers          lib          app.js     data      index.html  [ 120 ]   The models, views, collections, and routers folders contain JavaScript files that  contain the Backbone models, views, collections, and routers. We add the D3 charts  to the js lib directory; additional JavaScript libraries would be there too. There is  also a data folder with JSON files for the stock data. The index.html file contains  the application markup.  The index page In the header of the page, we include style sheets and JavaScript libraries that we  need for our application. To create the page more quickly, we will use a CSS library  that will add styles to enable uniform fonts, sizes, and default colors among browsers  and define the grid system. A grid system is a set of styles that allows us to define  rows and columns of standard column sizes without having to define the styles for  each size ourselves. We will use Yahoo's Pure CSS modules to use the grid system,  which is a pretty minimal set of CSS modules. These modules are used only in this  page; if you are more comfortable with Bootstrap or other libraries, you are free to  replace the div classes or define the sizes and behaviors of each container yourself.  We will create a container for the application and add the pure-g-r class, which is  a container with responsive behavior enabled. If the viewport is wide, the columns  will be shown side by side; if the user has a small screen, the columns will be shown  stacked. We will also create two child containers, one for the stock control and  title and a second container for the stock area chart, both classed pure-u-1, that is,  containers with full width. The pure container uses fractional sizes to define the div  width; in order to have a div that covers 80 percent of the parent container width, we  can set its class to pure-u-4-5:                                                       We include the application files at the end of the page so that the markup is rendered  while the remaining assets are loaded:           [ 121 ]                   Creating the models and collections Models contain application data and the logic related to this data. For our  application, we will need a model to represent the stock information and the  application model, which will store the visualization state. We will also create a  collection that holds the available stock instances. To avoid polluting the global  namespace, we will encapsulate the application components in the app variable:  var app = app  {};  Adding this line to all the files in the application will allow us to extend the object  with models, collections, and views.  The stock model The stock model will contain basic information about each stock. It will contain   the stock name  Apple Inc. , the symbol  AAPL , and the URL where the time   series of prices can be retrieved  aapl.json . Models are created by extending  Backbone.Model:     Stock Information Model app.Stock = Backbone.Model.extend {         Default stock symbol, name and url     defaults: {symbol: null, name: null, url: null},         The stock symbol is unique, it can be used as ID     idAttribute: 'symbol' } ;  Here, we defined the default values for the model to null. This is not really  necessary, but it might be useful to know which properties are expected. We will use  the stock symbol as ID. Besides this, we don't need any further initialization code. As  stock symbols are unique, we will use the symbol as the ID for easier retrieval later.  We can create stock instances by using the constructor and setting the attributes that  pass an object:  var appl = new app.Stock {         symbol: 'AAPL',   [ 122 ]           name: 'Apple',          url: 'aapl.json'     } ;  We can set or get its attributes using the accessor methods:  aapl.set 'name', 'Apple Inc.' ; aapl.get 'name' ;     Apple Inc.  In this application, we will create and access stock instances using a collection rather  than creating individual instances.  The stock collection To define a collection, we need to specify the model. When defining the collection,  we can set the URL of an endpoint where the collection records can be retrieved,  which is usually the URL of a REST endpoint. In our case, the URL points towards   a static JSON file that contains the stocks records:     Stock Collection app.StockList = Backbone.Collection.extend {     model: app.Stock,     url: ' chapter06 stocks data stocks.json' } ;  Individual stocks can be added to the collection one by one, or they can be fetched  from the server using the collection URL. We can also specify the URL when creating  the collection instance:     Create a StockList instance var stockList = new app.StockList {} ;     Add one element to the collection stockList.add {     symbol: 'AAPL',     name: 'Apple Inc.',     url: 'aapl.json' } ; stockList.length;    1  As we defined the stock symbol as idAttribute, individual stock instances can be  retrieved using the stock's ID. In this case, the stock symbol is the ID of the stock  model, so we can retrieve stock instances using the symbol:  var aapl = stockList.get 'AAPL' ;  [ 123 ]   Models use the URL of the collection to construct their own URL. The default URL  will have the form collectionUrl modelId. If the server provides a RESTful API,  this URL can be used to create, update, and delete records.  The application model We will create an application model to store and manage the application state.  To define the application model, we extend the Backbone.Model object, adding   the corresponding default values. The stock attribute will contain the current   stock symbol  AAPL , and the data will contain the time series for the current stock:     Application Model app.StockAppModel = Backbone.Model.extend {         Model default values     defaults: {         stock: null,         from: null,         to: null,         data: []     },      initialize: function   {         this.on 'change:stock', this.fetchData ;         this.listenTo app.Stocks, 'reset', this.fetchData ;     },         Additional methods...     getStock: function   {...},     fetchData: function   {...} } ;  We will also set a template for the stock collection data. In this case, the base URL is  chapter06 stocks data . As we mentioned previously, there is a JSON file in the  data directory with the data of the available stocks:         Compiled template for the stock data url    urlTemplate: _.template ' chapter06 stocks data  ' ,  [ 124 ]   We have also added a fetchData method in order to retrieve the time series for   the corresponding stock. We invoke the template that passes the current stock data  and use the parsed URL to retrieve the stock time series. We use the d3.json method  to get the stock data and set the model data attribute to notify the views that the data  is ready:      fetchData: function   {         Fetch the current stock data         var that = this,             stock = this.getStock  ,             url = this.urlTpl stock.toJSON   ;          d3.json url, function error, data  {             if  error  { return error; }             that.set 'data', data.values ;         } ;     }  Implementing the views To integrate the D3-based charts with Backbone Views, we will use the   following strategy:  1.  We will create and configure a chart instance as an attribute of the view. In the initialization method, we tell the view to listen for changes on the  2.  model application and render the view on model updates.  The views for the page components are in the chapter06 stocks js views  stocks.js file, and the application view code is in the chapter06 stocks js  views app.js file.  The title view This view will simply display the stock symbol and name. It's intended to be used  as a title of the visualization. We create and configure an instance of the underlying  chart and store a reference to the chart in the chart attribute. In the initialize  method, we tell the view to invoke the render method when the model's stock  attribute is updated.  [ 125 ]   In the render method, we create a selection that will hold the container element of  the view, bind this element to a dataset that contains the current stock, and invoke  the chart using selection.chart:  app.StockTitleView = Backbone.View.extend {      chart: stockTitleChart           .title function d  {             return _.template '  ', d ;         } ,      initialize: function   {         this.listenTo this.model, 'change:stock', this.render ;         this.render  ;     },      render: function   {         d3.select this.el              .data [this.model.getStock  .toJSON  ]              .call this.chart ;          return this;     } } ;  Changes to the stock attribute of the application model will trigger the  change:stock event, causing the view to invoke its render method, updating   the D3 chart. In this particular view, using a reusable chart is overkill; for a real-life  problem, we could have used a small Backbone View with a template. We did this   to have a minimal example of reusable charts working with Backbone Views.  Rendered stock title view  The stock selector view To add some diversity, we will create the selector without using D3. This view will  show you the available stocks as a selection menu, updating the application model's  stock attribute when the user selects a value. In this view, we will use a template. To  create a template, we create a script element of type text template in the index.html  file and assign it an ID, in our case, stock-selector-tpl:     [ 126 ]             ...      Underscore templates can render variables using   and execute  JavaScript code using  . Here, for instance, we evaluate the  callback function on each element of the stocks array:         ">      For each one of the elements of the stocks array, we add an option with the stock  symbol attribute as the value and content of the option element. After rendering the  template with the application data, the HTML markup will be as follows:       AAPL     MSFT     IBM     AMZN     In the Backbone View, we select the content of the script with the stock-selector- tpl ID, compile the template to use it later, and store a reference to the compiled  template in the template attribute:     Stock Selector View app.StockSelectorView = Backbone.View.extend {         Compiles the view template     template: _.template $ 'stock-selector-tpl' .html   ,         DOM Event Listeners     events: {         'change stock-selector': 'stockSelected'     },         Initialization and render methods... } ;  We set the events attribute, with maps' DOM events of the inner elements of the  view, to methods of the view. In this case, we bind changes to the stock-selector  select element  the user changing the stock  with the stockSelected method.  [ 127 ]   In the initialize method, we tell the view to render when the app.Stocks  collection emits the reset event. This event is triggered when new data is fetched   with the {reset: true} option  and when an explicit reset is triggered. If a new set  of stocks is retrieved, we will want to update the available options. We also listen for  changes to the application model's stock attribute. The current stock should always  be the selected option in the select element:      initialize: function   {            Listen for changes to the collection and the model         this.listenTo app.Stocks, 'reset', this.render ;         this.listenTo this.model, 'change:stock', this.render ;         this.render  ;     }  In the render method, we select the container element and set the element content  to the rendered template, writing the necessary markup to display the drop-down  control. We pass a JavaScript object with the stock attribute set to an array that  contains the app.Stocks model's data. Finally, we iterate through the options in  order to mark the option that matches the current stock symbol as selected:      render: function   {            Stores a reference to the 'this context'         var self = this;             Render the select element         this.$el.html this.template {stocks: app.Stocks.toJSON  } ;             Update the selected option         $ 'stock-selector option' .each function   {             this.selected =  this.value === self.model.get 'stock'  ;         } ;     }  Backbone models and collection instances have the JSON method, which transforms  the model or collection attributes to a JavaScript object. This method can be  overloaded if we need to add computed properties besides the existing attributes.  Note that in the each callback, the this context is set to the current DOM element,  that is, the option element. We store a reference to the this context in the render  function  the self variable  in order to reference it later.  Stock selector view allows selecting a stock by symbol  [ 128 ]   The stock context view The context view contains a small area chart that allows the user to select a time  interval that can be displayed in the detail view:  We will use the same strategy as the one used in the previous views to create and  configure an instance of stockAreaChart, and store a reference to it in the chart  attribute of the view:  app.StockContextView = Backbone.View.extend {         Initialize the stock area chart     chart: stockAreaChart           .height 60          .margin {top: 5, right: 5, bottom: 20, left: 30}          .date function d  { return new Date d.date ; }          .value function d  { return +d.price; }          .yaxis false ,         Render the view on model changes     initialize: function   { ... },      render: function e  { ... } } ;  In the initialize method, we tell the view to listen for changes to the application  model and set the chart brush listener to update the from and to attributes of   the model:      initialize: function   {             Get the width of the container element         var width = parseInt d3.select this.el .style 'width' , 10 ;             Bind the brush listener function. The listener will update            the model time interval         var self = this;          this.chart             .width width              .brushListener function extent  {                 self.model.set {from: extent[0], to: extent[1]} ;             } ;             The view will render on changes to the model         this.listenTo this.model, 'change', this.render ;     },  [ 129 ]   We get the width of the this.el container element using D3 and set the chart width.  This will make the chart use the full width of the user's viewport.  The chart fills the container width in Safari Mobile  iPhone Simulator   The render method will update the chart's time extent, so it reflects the current state  of the model, creates a selection that holds the container element of the view, binds  the stock data, and invokes the chart using selection.call:      render: function   {            Update the time extent         this.chart             .timeExtent [                 this.model.get 'from' ,                  this.model.get 'to'              ] ;             Select the container element and call the chart         d3.select this.el              .data [this.model.get 'data' ]              .call this.chart ;          return this;     }  [ 130 ]   This view is the only component that can change the from and to attributes of   the model.  The stock context view uses the brush behavior to set the time interval  The stock detail view The stock detail view will contain a stock area chart, showing only a given time  interval. It's designed to follow the time interval selected in the stock context view.  We create and configure a stockAreaChart instance, setting the margin, value, and  date accessors and disabling the brushing behavior:     Stock Detail Chart app.StockDetailView = Backbone.View.extend {         Initialize the stock area chart     chart: stockAreaChart           .margin {top: 5, right: 5, bottom: 30, left: 30}          .value function d  { return +d.price; }          .date function d  { return new Date d.date ; }          .brush false ,         Render the view on model changes     initialize: function   { ... },     render: function   { ... } } ;  As we did in the context view, we tell the view to invoke the render method on  model changes in the initialize method:      initialize: function   {             Get the width of the container element         var width = parseInt d3.select this.el .style 'width' , 10 ;             Set the chart width to fill the container         this.chart.width width ;             The view will listen the application model for changes         this.listenTo this.model, 'change', this.render ;     },  [ 131 ]   In the render method, we update the chart time extent, so the visible section of the  area chart matches the time interval specified by the application model s from and   to attribute:      render: function   {             Update the chart time extent         var from = this.model.get 'from' ,             to = this.model.get 'to' ;          this.chart.timeExtent [from, to] ;             Select the container element and create the chart         d3.select this.el              .data [this.model.get 'data' ]              .call this.chart ;     }  The detail view shows you the stock prices for the selected time interval  Note that when using object.listenTo other, 'event', callback , the this  context in the callback function will be the object that listens for the events  object .  The application view The application view will be in charge of creating instances of the views for each  component of the application.  [ 132 ]   The initialize method binds the reset event of the app.Stocks collection and  then invokes the collection's fetch method, passing the {reset: true} option. The  collection will request the data to the server using its url attribute. When the data  is completely loaded, it will trigger the reset event, and the application view will  invoke its render method:     Application View app.StockAppView = Backbone.View.extend {         Listen to the collection reset event     initialize: function   {         this.listenTo app.Stocks, 'reset', this.render ;         app.Stocks.fetch {reset: true} ;     },      render: function   { ... } } ;  In the render method, we create instances of the views that we just created for each  component. At this point, the current symbol of the application can be undefined, so  we get the first stock in the app.Stocks collection and set the stock attribute of the  model if is not already set.  We proceed to initialize the views for the title, the selector, the context chart, and the  detail chart, passing along a reference to the model instance and the DOM element  where the views will be rendered:      render: function   {             Get the first stock in the collection         var first = app.Stocks.first  ;             Set the stock to the first item in the collection         if  !this.model.get 'stock'   {             this.model.set 'stock', first.get 'symbol'  ;         }             Create and initialize the title view         var titleView = new app.StockTitleView {             model: this.model,             el: 'divstock-title'         } ;             Create and initialize the selector view  [ 133 ]           var controlView = new app.StockSelectorView {             model: this.model,             el: 'divstock-control'         } ;             Create and initialize the context view         var contextView = new app.StockContextView {             model: this.model,             el: 'divstock-context'         } ;             Create and initialize the detail view         var detailView = new app.StockDetailView {             model: this.model,             el: 'divstock-detail'         } ;             Fetch the stock data.         this.model.fetchData  ;         return this;     }  Finally, we tell the model to fetch the stock data to allow the context and detail chart  to be rendered. Remember that when the data is ready, the model will set its data  attribute, notifying the charts to update its contents.  Components of the rendered application  [ 134 ]   Defining the routes In our application, the state of the visualization can be described by the stock symbol  and the time interval selected in the context chart. In this section, we will connect the  URL with the application state, allowing the user to navigate  using the back button  of the browser  the bookmark and share a particular state of the application.  We define the routes for our application by assigning callbacks for each hash URL   Backbone provides support for real URLs too . Here, we define two routes, one to  set the stock and one to set the complete state of the application. If the user types  the stock AAPL hash fragment, the setStock method will be invoked, passing the  'AAPL' string as the argument. The second route allows you to navigate to a specific  state of the application using a URL fragment of the stock AAPL from Mon Dec 01  2003 to Tue Mar 02 2010 form; this will invoke the setState method of the router:  app.StockRouter = Backbone.Router.extend {         Define the application routes     routes: {         'stock :stock': 'setStock',         'stock :stock from :from to :to': 'setState'     },         Initialize and route callbacks... } ;  The router also has an initialize method, which will be in charge of synchronizing  changes in the application URL with changes in the application model. We will set  the model for the router and configure the router to listen for change events of the  model. At the beginning, the data might not have been loaded yet  and the from and  to attributes might be undefined at this point ; in this case, we set the stock symbol  only. When the data finishes the loading, the from and to attributes will change and  the router will invoke its setState method:         Listen to model changes to update the url route     initialize: function attributes  {         this.model = attributes.model;         this.listenTo this.model, 'change', function m  {             if  m.get 'from'  && m.get 'to'   {                 this.setState m.get 'stock' , m.get 'from' ,  m.get 'to'  ;             } else {                 this.setStock m.get 'stock'  ;             }         } ;     },  [ 135 ]   The setStock method updates the symbol attribute of the model. The navigate  method updates the browser URL to reflect the change of stock. Note that we are  using the time interval as a variable of the application state. If we select an interval,  the back button of the browser will get us to the previously selected time intervals.  This might not be desirable in some cases. The choice of which variables should be  included in the URL will depend on the application and the behavior that most users  will expect. In this case for instance, an alternative approach could be to update the  application state on drag start and drag end, not on every change in the interval:             Set the application stock and updates the url         setStock: function symbol  {             var urlTpl = _.template 'stock  ' ;              this.model.set {stock: symbol} ;             this.navigate urlTpl {stock: symbol} , {trigger: true} ;         },  The setState method parses the from and to parameters from the URL as dates and  sets the model's stock, from, and to attributes. As we cast the strings to the date,  we can use any format recognizable by the date constructor  YYYY-MM-DD, for  instance , but this will imply that we format the from and to attributes to this format  when the model changes in order to update the URL. We will use the toDateString  method to keep things simple. After setting the model state, we construct the URL  and invoke the navigate method to update the browser URL:             Set the application state and updates the url         setState: function symbol, from, to  {              from = new Date from ,             to = new Date to ;              this.model.set {stock: symbol, from: from, to: to} ;              var urlTpl = _.template 'stock   from <%= from  %> to  ' ,                 fromString = from.toDateString  ,                 toString = to.toDateString  ;              this.navigate urlTpl {stock: symbol, from: fromString,  to: toString} , {trigger: true} ;         }  [ 136 ]   The simple addition of a router can make an application way more useful, allowing  users to bookmark and share a particular state of the page and navigate back to  previous states of the application.  The application state is displayed in the browser URL  Initializing the application Once we have created the application models, collections, views, and router, we can  create the instances for the application model and view. The application initialization  code is in the chapter06 stocks js app.js file.  We begin by creating an instance of the app.StockList collection:     Create an instance of the stocks collection app.Stocks = new app.StockList  ;  The collection instances will be retrieved later.  [ 137 ]   We create an instance of the application model and an instance of the application  view. We initialize the application model by indicating the model of the view and the  container element ID:     Create the application model instance app.appModel = new app.StockAppModel  ;     Create the application view app.appView = new app.StockAppView {     model: app.appModel,      el: 'divstock-app' } ;  Finally, we initialize the router, passing the application model as the first argument,  and then we tell Backbone to begin monitoring changes to hashchange events:     Initializes the router var router = new app.StockRouter {model: app.appModel} ; Backbone.history.start  ;  Summary  In this chapter, you learned how to create a single page application that integrates  D3 and Backbone. We used the reusable chart pattern and embedded the charts in  Backbone Views, allowing us to enjoy the structure of Backbone and keep all the  visualization components synchronized.  We created the stock explorer application. This application allows the user to choose  and explore the time series of stock prices, allowing the user to select the stock and a  time interval in order to have a detail view of the price variations in that period. We  used Backbone to store the visualization state and the views in sync.  We used a router to connect the visualization state with the URL, allowing us to  share, bookmark, and navigate through visited application states.  In the next chapter, you will learn how to create a charting package, which will  contain a layout and a reusable chart. We will also learn how to configure it to make it  easier to distribute, install, upgrade, and manage its dependencies on other packages.  [ 138 ]   Creating a Charting Package  Writing good quality software involves several tasks in addition to writing the code.  Maintaining a code repository, testing, and writing consistent documentation are  some of the tasks that need to be done when working with other people. This is also  the case when we write charts and visualizations with D3. If we create a charting  package, we would like to make it easy for others to use it and integrate it in their  projects. In this chapter, we will describe a workflow and the tools that will help us  to create a charting package. In this chapter, we will cover the following tasks:     Creating a repository: A version control system should be used. In some   cases, this involves configuring a central repository.     Designing the API: Decide how to organize the code in logic units and how   the package functionality will be exposed.     Writing the code: Implement the package components and features.    Testing: The package components should be tested to minimize the risk of   introducing unexpected behavior and breaking the existing functionality.     Building: The source code isn't shipped as is to build a package. This implies  that at least source files need to be concatenated and a minified version of the  distributable files should be created.     Hosting the package: The package should be accessible for others to use,   even if it's intended for internal usage.  Also, there are a number of conventions and norms about how these tasks should be  performed. There may be protocols for the following:     Committing changes: This is a workflow to know how to merge hot fixes or  new features for the next release or the development version of the project.  This may include tasks to be done before you push for changes, such as  testing the code or having code review sessions.      Creating a release: This is a procedure to create, tag, and release new   versions of the software, including how to follow a system to tag releases  with version numbers.     Writing code: This is a set of coding practices and conventions agreed upon   by the teams.  Most of these tasks and protocols depend on the team and the type of project, but it  is almost certain that a number of them will  or should  be in place.  In this chapter, we will create a D3-based charting package. We will use tools to  check code conventions, test, and build distributable files for our charting package.  Even if the tools that we will use have proven to be successful and are widely used  in frontend projects, you may prefer to use different tools for some of the tasks. Feel  free to explore and discover a toolset more appropriate for your workflow.  The development workflow  In this section, we will provide an overview of the workflow to create and distribute  our charting package. We will also discuss some conventions regarding version  numbers and the process of creating a release, introduce tools that will help us  to manage the dependences with other projects, run the tests, and automate the  package building process.  Writing the code We begin by creating the project directory and the initial package content. During  the development of our charting package, we need to perform the following actions:  Implement new features or modify the existing code        Check whether our code follows the coding guidelines     Implement tests for the new functionality or create additional tests for the  existing features     Run tests to ensure that the modifications don't introduce unexpected   behaviors or break the public API     Concatenate the source files to generate a single JavaScript file that contains   the charting package     Generate a minified file  [ 140 ]   When implementing new features or fixing bugs, we will modify the code, check   for errors, and run the tests. We will repeat the modify-check-test cycle several times  until we finish implementing the feature or fix the bug. At this point, we will check  and test the code again, build the package, and commit our changes.  As mentioned before, there are many tools that will help us to automate these tasks.  There are a great number of tools to make the frontend workflow easier, and every  developer has his or her preferences and opinions in this regard. In this chapter,  we will use Node.js modules to orchestrate our development tasks. We will use the  following tools:     Vows: This is an asynchronous, behavior-driven JavaScript testing   framework for Node.js. We will use Vows to test our charting package.     Grunt: This is a task runner for Node.js. We will use Grunt and some plugins   to check the source files, concatenate, minify, and test our package.     Bower: This is a frontend package management system. We will configure  our package such that users can install our package and its dependencies   D3  easily.  Creating a release Depending on our development workflow, we may want to create a release.   A release is a state of our package that we distribute for it to be used. It's usually  identified with a version number that indicates how much it has changed from the  previous versions.  Semantic Versioning The version number is especially important in systems with many dependencies.  Depending too much on the functionality provided by a specific version of a package  can lead to a version lock, that is, the inability to update the package without having  to release new versions of our own package. On the other hand, if we update the  package assuming that it's compatible with our software, we will eventually find  that it is not the case and that the package has made changes to the API that are not  compatible with our software. Semantic Versioning is a useful convention that helps you to know if it's safe to  update a package, as long as it follows the Semantic Versioning convention. The  complete specification of Semantic Versioning 2.0.0  yes, the specification itself is  versioned  is available at http:  semver.org . The key points of the Semantic  Versioning convention are as follows.  [ 141 ]   Each release should be assigned a version number of the form MAJOR.MINOR. PATCH, with optional identifiers after a dash  1.0.0-beta, for instance . The version  numbers are integers  without leading zeros  and should be incremented when we  create a new release by the following rules:     MAJOR: This version is used when you make backward-incompatible      MINOR: This version is used when a new functionality is added without      PATCH: This version is used for improvements and bug fixes that don't   changes to the API  breaking the API  change the public API  When we increment the MAJOR version, MINOR and PATCH are set to zero;  increments in MINOR will reset the PATCH number to zero. The content of a   release must not be modified; any modification should be released as a new version.  If we follow this convention, users will know that upgrading from 2.1.34 to 2.1.38 is  safe and upgrading from 2.1.38 to 2.2.0 is also safe  and it may provide additional  backward-compatible features , while upgrading from 2.2.0 to 3.0.1 will require  you to check whether the changes in the new version are still compatible with the  existing code. In the next sections, we will create the initial content of the package  and configure the tools to test and build our package.  Creating the package contents  We will create a small package containing a heat map chart and a layout function.  We begin by choosing a name for our project, creating an empty directory, and  initializing the repository. The name of our package will be Windmill. Once we have  created the directory, we can create the initial content. We will organize the code  in components and implement the chart and the helper functions in separate files.  The source code will be organized in folders, one for each component. Later, we will  concatenate the files in the correct order to generate the windmill.js file, containing  all the components of the package:  src     chart        chart.js       heatmap.js    layout        layout.js       matrix.js    svg        svg.js  [ 142 ]         transform.js    start.js    end.js  We add the version attribute and indicate that we will follow the Semantic   Version specification:  !function   {     var windmill = {version: '0.1.0'};    semver        Charts     windmill.chart = {};     windmill.chart.heatmap = function   {...};        Other Components... }  ;  We can load this file in the browser or using Node.js. In either case, the anonymous  function will be invoked, but nothing more will happen. In order to expose the  package functionality in Node, we need to load D3 as a Node package in the context  of the module and export the contents of the windmill object. This will allow other  Node modules  our tests, for instance  to load our package as a Node module. If the  file is loaded in the browser, we assume that D3 is available and add the windmill  attribute to the global object and set its value to the package contents. Note that  when we run the anonymous function in the global scope, the this context is set to  the global object:  !function   {     var windmill = {version: '0.1.0'};    semver         Charts     windmill.chart = {};     windmill.chart.heatMap = function   {...};         Other Components...          Expose the package components     if  typeof module === 'object' && module.exports  {            The package is loaded as a node module         this.d3 = require 'd3' ;         module.exports = windmill;     } else {            The file is loaded in the browser.         this.windmill = windmill;     } }  ;  [ 143 ]   To generate this file, we need to concatenate the source files in order. The   src start.js file will contain the beginning of the function and the package  version, which must be updated in each release:  !function   {     var windmill = {version: '0.1.0'};    semver  Each component will add an attribute to the windmill variable. For instance,   the src chart chart.js file will contain the following attribute:         Charts     windmill.chart = {};  The src chart heatmap.js file will add a function to the chart attribute:      windmill.chart.heatMap = function   {...};  The matrix layout should be included in the same way. The src end.js file will  contain the last part of the consolidated file. If the file is loaded as a Node.js module,  the module.exports variable will be defined; we import the D3 library and export  the windmill package. If the file is loaded in the browser, we assign the windmill  object to the window object, making it available as a global variable:         Expose the package components     if  typeof module === 'object'&& module.exports  {            The package is loaded as a node module         this.d3 = require 'd3' ;         module.exports = windmill;     } else {            The file is loaded in the browser.         window.windmill = windmill;     } }  ;  The heat map chart A heat map is a chart that aims to represent the dependency of one quantitative  variable as a function of two ordinal variables.  [ 144 ]   A heat map is a chart that allows you to visualize the dependency between a variable  and two other variables. It resembles a matrix where each cell's color is proportional  to the value of the main variable, and the rows and columns represent the other  variables. Refer to the following screenshot:  A heat map showing the average wind speeds by hour and month  Heat maps are useful to detect patterns and the dependency between the target  variable in the function of the variables represented by the rows and columns.   We will put the code for the heat map chart in the src chart heatmap.js file.   We will implement the heat map chart as a reusable chart, but this time, we will  generate the accessor methods automatically to avoid writing similar code for each  chart attribute. We begin by adding the heatmap function as an attribute of the  windmill.chart object:     HeatMap Chart windmill.chart.heatmap = function   {     'use strict';      function chart selection  {            ...     }      return chart; };  [ 145 ]   Heatmap function usually receives a matrix as data input while heat maps usually  receive a matrix as input data. We can represent a matrix as a nested array or use a  columnar representation of a matrix, where each cell is represented as an item in a  list. Each item has a row, column, and value, indicating the content of each cell in the  matrix  this representation is especially useful for sparse matrices . The default input  data will be an array of objects with at least three attributes: rows, columns, and values:      var data = [         {row: 1, column: 1, value: 5.5},         {row: 1, column: 2, value: 2.5},            more items...         {row: 6, column: 4, value: 7.5}     ];  We will add configurable accessor functions so that the user can configure which  attributes will be the rows, columns, and values. As we will generate the accessor  methods automatically, we will hold the chart properties in the attributes object.  This element will be used to generate the accessor methods:     HeatMap Chart windmill.chart.heatmap = function   {     'use strict';         Default Attribute Container     var attributes = {         width: 600,         height: 300,         margin: {top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 40, left: 40},         colorExtent: ['000', 'aaa'],         value: function d  { return d.value; },         row: function d  { return d.row; },         column: function d  { return d.column; }     };         Charting function...      return chart; }  We set the default values for the width, height, margin, and color extent. We also  define default accessor functions for the rows, columns, and values.  [ 146 ]   We will generate accessor methods for each attribute. We want the generated  accessors to have the same behavior as that of the accessors written explicitly. Also,  we want to be able to overwrite accessors if we need to include more logic than to  simply get or set a value. Until now, we have written the accessor method for the  width attribute as follows:      chart.width = function w  {         if  !arguments.length  { return width; }         width = w;         return chart;     };  If no arguments are passed, the chart.width method will return the current value  of the width variable. If we pass a value, the width value is updated and we return  the chart to allow method chaining. Since our attributes object holds the chart  properties, we should update this method:      chart['width'] = function val  {         if  !arguments.length  { return attributes['width']; }         attributes['width'] = val;         return chart;     };  Here, we avoided hardcoding the width attribute. This will work, but we still have  to write a function that receives a value and modifies the width attribute. We will  create a function that returns an accessor function for a specific attribute:         Create an accessor function for the given attribute     function createAccessor attr  {            Accessor function         function accessor value  {             if  !arguments.length  { return attributes[attr]; }             attributes[attr] = value;             return chart;         }         return accessor;     }  We can now assign an accessor function for the width attribute using the   following code:         Set the accessor function for the width     chart['width'] = createAccessor 'width' ;  [ 147 ]   This is still not good enough; we should iterate the properties of the attributes  object and create one accessor method for each property. First, we should check  whether the accessor already exists to avoid overwriting it, and we should verify   that the properties are of the attributes object, and not from the higher accessor   in the prototype chain:         Create accessors for each element in attributes     for  var attr in attributes  {         if   !chart[attr]  &&  attributes.hasOwnProperty attr    {             chart[attr] = createAccessor attr ;         }     }  This will generate an accessor for each property in the attributes object. Note   that the accessors will just get and set the attributes; there are no validations or logic  besides assigning or returning the values. If we need a more complex accessor for an  attribute, we can add it and it won't be overwritten.  The charting function will select the div container and create an svg element to  contain the chart. As we have done before, we will encapsulate the initialization   of the svg element in the chart.svgInit method:         Charting function     function chart selection  {         selection.each function data  {                Initialize the SVG element on enter             var div = d3.select this ,                 svg = div.selectAll 'svg' .data [data]                      .enter  .append 'svg'                      .call chart.svgInit ;         } ;     }  In the chart.svgInit method, we set the dimensions of the svg element and create  groups for the chart and the horizontal and vertical axes:         Initialize the SVG Element     chart.svgInit = function svg  {             Compute the width and height of the charting area         var margin = chart.margin  ,             width = chart.width   - margin.left - margin.right,             height = chart.height   - margin.top - margin.bottom,             translate = windmill.svg.translate;             Set the size of the svg element  [ 148 ]           svg             .attr 'width', chart.width                .attr 'height', chart.height   ;             Chart Container         svg.append 'g'              .attr 'class', 'chart'              .attr 'transform', translate margin.left, margin.top  ;             X Axis Container         svg.append 'g'              .attr 'class', 'axis xaxis'              .attr 'transform', translate margin.left, margin.top + height  ;             Y Axis Container         svg.append 'g'              .attr 'class', 'axis yaxis'              .attr 'transform', translate margin.left, margin.top  ;     };  Here, we used the accessor method generated previously to access the width, height,  and margin. We can also access these through the attributes object in the charting  code, but the attribute won't be accessible for code using the chart object. In the  charting function, we compute the width and height of the charting area and create  shortcuts for the row, column, and value accessors. Without these shortcuts, we would  need to invoke the row function either as attributes.row d  or chart.row   d :                 Compute the width and height of the chart area             var margin = chart.margin  ,                 width = chart.width   - margin.left - margin.right,                 height = chart.height   - margin.top - margin.bottom;                 Retrieve the accessor functions             var row = chart.row  ,                 col = chart.column  ,                 val = chart.value  ;  [ 149 ]   We can create the scales for the position and color of the rectangles. We will use  ordinal scales and use the rangeBands range. This option allows you to divide an  interval into n evenly spaced bands, where n is the number of unique elements in   the domain:                 Horizontal Position             var xScale = d3.scale.ordinal                   .domain data.map col                   .rangeBands [0, width] ;                 Vertical Position             var yScale = d3.scale.ordinal                   .domain data.map row                   .rangeBands [0, height] ;                 Color Scale             var cScale = d3.scale.linear                   .domain d3.extent data, val                   .range chart.colorExtent   ;  We can create the rectangles on enter as follows:                 Create the heatmap rectangles on enter             var rect = gchart.selectAll 'rect' .data data                  .enter  .append 'rect' ;  We can set the width, height, and position of the rectangles, and set the fill color  using the aforementioned scales and accessor functions for the rows, columns, and  values. The width and height are set using the width of a band, which is computed  by the scale:                 Set the attributes of the rectangles             rect.attr 'width', xScale.rangeBand                    .attr 'height', yScale.rangeBand                    .attr 'x', function d  { return xScale col d  ; }                  .attr 'y', function d  { return yScale row d  ; }                  .attr 'fill', function d  { return cScale val d  ; } ;  Finally, we add the axes for the horizontal and vertical axes:                 Create the Horizontal Axis             var xAxis = d3.svg.axis                   .scale xScale                  .orient 'bottom' ;  [ 150 ]               svg.select 'g.xaxis' .call xAxis ;                 Create the Vertical Axis             var yAxis = d3.svg.axis                   .scale yScale                  .orient 'left' ;             svg.select 'g.yaxis' .call yAxis ;  We will create an example file for the heat map. In the examples heatmap.html file,  we create a container div with the chart01 ID:      We will generate a sample data array and create a chart instance, configuring the  width, height, and color extent:     Generate a sample data array var data = []; for  var k = 0; k < 20; k += 1  {     for  var j = 0; j < 20; j += 1  {         data.push {             row: k,              column: j,              value: Math.cos Math.PI * k * j   60          } ;     } }     Create and configure the heatmap chart var heatmap = windmill.chart.heatmap       .width 600      .height 300      .colorExtent ['555, 'ddd'] ;  Here, the lower values will be dark gray, and the higher values will be blue.   The matrix data contains values for two rows and four columns. We have given   a value for each cell; if there were missing items, the cells would just not be drawn.  We select the container element, bind the data array, and invoke the heat map using  the selection.call method:         Create the heatmap chart in the container selection     d3.select 'divchart01' .data [data]          .call heatmap ;  [ 151 ]   The generated heat map will have eight cells; the color of each cell represents   the value's magnitude corresponding to each row and column. Refer to the   following screenshot:  A heat map with the default styles  We will create and include a style sheet file to get a better-looking axis. As the users  will need the CSS files to use the chart, we should make the styles available to the  users as well. A user could also modify the styles to accommodate the appearance  of the chart to the client application. We will add the windmill.css file to the css  directory and add the following content:   * Axis lines *  .axis path, line {     fill: none;     stroke: 222222;     shape-rendering: crispEdges; }  * Style for the xaxis *  .xaxis {     font-size: 12px;     font-family: sans-serif; }  * Style for the yaxis *  .yaxis {     font-size: 12px;     font-family: sans-serif }  [ 152 ]   With these styles, the heat map looks better, which can be seen as follows:  The heat map with improved styles  The matrix layout In the heat map chart, we assumed that we have unique combinations of the rows  and columns in our dataset; having more than one element with the same row and  column would cause two overlapping rectangles.  We will create a layout to aggregate the values with the same rows and columns using  a configurable aggregation function. For instance, we could have the following dataset:  var data = [     {row: 1, column: 2, value: 5},     {row: 1, column: 2, value: 4},     {row: 1, column: 2, value: 9},        ... ];  The matrix layout will allow us to group the values and calculate a single  aggregated value, which is usually the sum, count, average, minimum, or maximum  value. We will create the matrix layout in the src layout matrix.js file. As in the  heat map chart, we begin by adding the matrix property to the layout object. We  will use the reusable chart pattern, except that the charting function is replaced with  the layout function, which receives the input data and returns the aggregated array:  windmill.layout.matrix = function   {     'use strict';      function layout data  {  [ 153 ]             ...         return groupedData;     }      return layout; };  We will use the technique presented in the heat map chart to automatically generate  accessor methods. We add the default accessor methods as follows:         Default Accessors     var attributes = {         row: function d  { return d.row; },         column: function d  { return d.column; },         value: function d  { return d.value; },         aggregate: function values  {             var sum = 0;             values.forEach function d  { sum += d; } ;             return sum;         }     };  The row, column, and value accessor functions compute the row, column, and value  for each input data element. The aggregate function receives an array of values and  computes a single aggregated value. The default aggregate function will return the  sum of the elements in the input array:         Layout function     function layout data  {            Output data array         var groupedData = [];          return groupedData;     }             Group and aggregate the input values...  We begin by grouping the values for each combination of row and column. We  iterate through the input array and compute the item's row, column, and value. The  groupedData array will contain elements with the row, col, and values attributes.  If the groupedData array contains an element with the same row and column as the  current item, we append the value of the item to the values array; if not, we append  a new element to the grouped data array:             Group by row and column         data.forEach function d  {                 Compute the row, column, and value              row = attributes.row d ; [ 154 ]               col = attributes.column d ;             val = attributes.value d ;                 Search corresponding items in groupedData             found = false;              groupedData.forEach function item, idx  {                 if   item.row === row  &&  item.col === col   {                     groupedData[idx].values.push val ;                     item.values.push val ;                     found = true;                 }             } ;                 Append the item, if not found             if  !found  {                 groupedData.push {                     row: row,                      col: col,                      values: [val]                 } ;             }         } ;  We can now aggregate the values using the aggregate function. This function  receives an array and returns a single value. Finally, we remove the values attribute:         Aggregate the values     groupedData.forEach function d  {            Compute the aggregated value         d.value = attributes.aggregate d.values ;         delete d.values;     } ;  We generate accessor methods for the layout automatically, with code that is similar  to the code in the heat map chart:         Create accessor functions     function createAccessor attr  {         function accessor value  {             if  !arguments.length  { return attributes[attr]; }             attributes[attr] = value;             return layout;         }         return accessor;  [ 155 ]       }         Generate automatic accessors for each attribute     for  var attr in attributes  {         if   !layout[attr]  &&  attributes.hasOwnProperty attr    {             layout[attr] = createAccessor attr ;         }     }  We will create an example for the matrix layout. In the examples layout.html file,  we declare a data array with sample data as follows:         Sample data array     var data = [         {a: 1, b: 1, c: 10},         {a: 1, b: 1, c:  5},            ...         {a: 2, b: 2, c:  5}     ];  Note that for each combination of row and column, we have more than one element  in the array. We define the average function, computing the sum of all the elements  in the input array and dividing the sum by the array's length:         Define the aggregation function  average of values      var average = function values  {         var sum = 0;         values.forEach function d  { sum += d;} ;         return sum   values.length;     }  We create and configure a matrix layout instance, setting the row accessor to be a  function that returns the a attribute of each element, the column function will return  the b attribute, and the value will be the c property. We set the aggregate function  to use our average function:         Create and configure a matrix layout instance     var matrix = windmill.layout.matrix           .row function d  { return d.a; }          .column function d  { return d.b; }          .value function d  { return d.c; }          .aggregate average ;  We invoke the layout using the sample data array, obtaining an array that groups the  values by row and column:      var grouped = matrix data ;  [ 156 ]   The value of each element will be the average value for the items with the same  combination of row and column:     Output values grouped = [     {col: 1, row: 1, value: 7.5},        ...     {col: 2, row: 2, value: 10} ];  The matrix layout allows us to group and aggregate values, making it easier to  format data for the heat map chart. Now that we have the initial content, we will  configure the tools to build and distribute the package.  The project setup  In this section, we will install and configure the tools that we will use to build our  package. We will assume that you know how to use the command line and you  have Node installed on your system. You can install Node by either following the  instructions from Node.js's website  http:  nodejs.org download   or using a  package manager in Unix-like systems.  Installing the Node modules The Node Package Manager  npm  is a program that helps us to manage  dependencies between Node projects. As our project could be a dependency   of other projects, we need to provide information about our package to npm.   The package.json file is a JSON file that should contain at least the project name,  version, and dependencies for use and development. For now, we will add just the  name and version:  {   "name": "windmill",   "version": "0.1.0",   "dependencies": {},   "devDependencies": {} }  We will install Grunt, Vows, Bower, and D3 using npm. When installing a package,  we can pass an option to save the package that we are installing as a dependency.  With the --save-dev option, we can specify the development dependencies:  $ npm install --save-dev grunt vows bower  [ 157 ]   D3 will be a dependency for our package. If someone needs to use our package,   D3 will be needed; the previous packages will be necessary only for development.   To install the project dependencies, we can use the --save option:  $ npm install --save d3  A directory named node_modules will be created at the topmost level of the project.  This directory will contain the installed modules:  The package.json file will be updated with the dependencies as well:  node_modules     bower     d3     grunt     vows   {   "name": "windmill",   "version": "0.1.0",   "dependencies": {     "d3": "~3.4.1"   },   "devDependencies": {     "grunt": "~0.4.2",     "vows": "~0.7.0"   } }  Note that the dependencies specify the version of each package. Node.js packages  should follow the Semantic Versioning specification. We will include additional  modules to perform the building tasks, but we will cover that later.  Building with Grunt Grunt is a task runner for Node.js. It allows you to define tasks and execute  them easily. To use Grunt, we need to have a package.json file with the project  information and the Gruntfile.js file, where we will define and configure our  tasks. The Gruntfile.js file should have the following structure; all the Grunt   tasks and configurations should be in the exported function:  module.exports = function grunt  {       Grunt initialization and tasks };  [ 158 ]   The Grunt tasks may need configuration data, which is usually passed to the grunt. initConfig method. Here, we import the package configuration from the package. json file. This allows you to use the package configuration values in order to generate  banners in target files or to display information in the console when we run tasks:  module.exports = function grunt  {        Initialize the Grunt configuration     grunt.initConfig {         pkg: grunt.file.readJSON 'package.json'      } ; };  There are hundreds of Grunt plugins to automate every development task   with minimal effort. A complete list of the Grunt plugins is available at   http:  gruntjs.com plugins.  Concatenating our source files The grunt-contrib-concat plugin will concatenate our source files for us. We can  install the plugin as any other Node.js module:  $ npm install --save-dev grub-contrib-concat  To use the plugin, we should enable it and add its configuration as follows:  module.exports = function grunt  {     grunt.initConfig {         pkg: grunt.file.readJSON 'package.json' ,          concat: {                grunt-contrib-concat configuration...         }     } ;         Enable the Grunt plugins     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-concat' ; };  We add the grunt-contrib-concat configuration. The concat object can contain  one or more targets, each containing an array of sources and a destination path for  the concatenated file. The files in src will be concatenated in order:         Initialize the Grunt configuration     grunt.initConfig {             Import the package configuration  [ 159 ]           pkg: grunt.file.readJSON 'package.json' ,             Configure the concat task         concat: {             js: {                 src: [                     'src start.js',                     'src svg svg.js',                     'src svg transform.js',                     'src chart chart.js',                     'src chart heatmap.js',                     'src layout layout.js',                     'src layout matrix.js',                     'src end.js'                 ],                 dest: 'windmill.js'             }         },     } ;  There are options to add a banner too, which can be useful to add a comment  indicating the package name and version. We can run the concat task from the  command line as follows:  If we have several targets, we can build them individually by passing the target after  the concat option:  $ grunt concat  Running "concat:js"  concat  task  File "windmill.js" created.  Done, without errors.  $ grunt concat:js  Running "concat:js"  concat  task  File "windmill.js" created.  Done, without errors.  The windmill.js file contains the sources of our package concatenated in order,  preserving the original spaces and comments.  [ 160 ]   Minifying the library It's common practice to distribute two versions of the library: one version with  the original format and comments for debugging and another minified version for  production. To create the minified version, we will need the grunt-contrib-uglify  plugin. As we did with the grunt-contrib-concat package, we need to install this  and enable it in the Gruntfile.js file:  module.exports = function grunt  {        ...         Enable the Grunt plugins     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-concat' ;     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-uglify' ; };  We need to add the uglify configuration to the grunt.initConfig method as well.  In uglify, we can have more than one target. The options attribute allows us to  define the behavior of uglify. In this case, we set mangle to false in order to keep  the names of our variables as they are in the original code. If the mangle option is set  to true, the variable names will be replaced with shorter names, as follows:             Uglify Configuration         uglify: {             options: {                 mangle: false              },             js: {                 files: {                     'windmill.min.js': ['windmill.js']                 }             }         }  We can run the minification task in the command line using the same syntax as in the  concatenation task:  $ grunt uglify  Running "uglify:js"  uglify  task  File windmill.min.js created.  Done, without errors.  This will generate the windmill.min.js file, which is about half the size of the  original version.  [ 161 ]   Checking our code with JSHint In JavaScript, it is very easy to write code that doesn't behave as we expect. It could  be a missing semicolon or forgetting to declare a variable in a certain scope. A linter  is a program that helps us to detect potential errors and dangerous constructions by  enforcing a series of coding conventions. Of course, a static code analysis tool can't  detect these if your program is correct. JSHint is a tool that helps us to detect these  potential problems by checking the JavaScript code against code conventions. The  behavior of JSHint can be configured to match our coding conventions.  JSHint is a fork of JSLint, a tool created by Douglas Crockford to check  code against a particular set of coding standards. His choices on coding  style are explained in the book JavaScript: The Good Parts.  In JSHint, the code conventions can be set by writing a jshintrc file, a JSON file  containing a series of flags that will define the JSHint behavior. For instance, a  configuration file might contain the following flags:  {   "curly": true,   "eqeqeq": true,   "undef": true,      ... }  The curly option will enforce the use of curly braces  { and }  around conditionals  and loops, even if we have only one statement. The eqeqeq option enforces the use  of === and !== to compare objects, instead of == and !=. If you don't have a set of  coding conventions already, I would recommend that you read the list of JSHint  options available at http:  www.jshint.com docs options  and create a new  .jshintrc file. Here, the options are listed and explained, so you can make an  informed decision about which flags to enable.  Many editors have support for live linting, but even if the text editor checks the code  as you write, it is a good practice to check the code before committing your changes.  We will enable the grunt-contrib-jshint module and configure it so that we can  check our code easily. We will enable the plugin as follows:         Enable the Grunt plugins     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-concat' ;     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-uglify' ;     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-jshint' ;  [ 162 ]   Next, we configure the plugin. We will check the Gruntfile.js file, our tests, and  the code of our chart:          jshint: {             all: [                 'Gruntfile.js',                 'src svg *.js',                 'src chart *.js',                 'src layout *.js',                 'test *.js',                 'test * *.js'             ]         }  We can check our code using the following command lines:  $ grunt jshint  Running "jshint:all"  jshint  task  >> 11 files lint free.  Done, without errors.  Testing our package Distributing a software package is a great responsibility. The users of our charting  package rely on our code and assume that everything works as expected. Despite our  best intentions, we may break the existing functionality when implementing a new  feature or fixing a bug. The only way to minimize these errors is to extensively test  our code.  The tests should be easy to write and run, allowing us to write the tests as we code  new features and to run the tests before committing changes. There are several  test suites for JavaScript code. In this section, we will use Vows, an asynchronous  behavior-driven test suite for Node.js. Writing a simple test In Vows, the largest test unit is a suite. We will begin by creating a simple   test using JavaScript without any libraries. In the test directory, we create   the universe-test.js file.  We will load the vows and assert modules and assign them to the local variables:     Load the modules var vows = require 'vows' ,     assert = require 'assert' ;  [ 163 ]   We can create a suite now. The convention is to have one suite per file and to   match the suite description with the filename. We create a suite by invoking   the vows.describe method:     Create the suite var suite = vows.describe 'Universe' ;  Tests are added to the suite in batches. A suite can have zero or more batches, which  will be executed sequentially. The batches are added using the suite.addBatch  method. Batches allow you to perform tests in a given order:  A batch, in turn, contains zero or more contexts, which describe the behaviors or  states that we want to test. Contexts are run in parallel, and they are asynchronous;  the order in which they will be completed can't be predicted. We will add a context  to our batch, as follows:  A context contains a topic. The topic is a value or function that returns an element  to be tested. The vows are the actual tests. The vows are the functions that make  assertions about the topic. We will add a topic to our context as follows:  suite.addBatch {       ... } ;  suite.addBatch {     'the answer': {           ...     } } ;  suite.addBatch {     'the answer': {         topic: 42,           ...     } } ;  In this case, all our vows in the context the answer will receive the value 42 as the  argument. We will add some vows to assert whether the topic is undefined, null, or  a number, and finally, whether the topic is equal to 42. Refer to the following code:  suite.addBatch {     'the answer': {         topic: 42,         "shouldn't be undefined": function topic  {             assert.notEqual topic, undefined ;         },  [ 164 ]           "shouldn't be null": function topic  {             assert.notEqual topic, null ;         },         "should be a number": function topic  {             assert.isNumber topic ;         },         "should be 42": function topic  {             assert.equal topic, 42 ;         }     } } ;  To execute all the tests in the test directory as a single entity  instead of having to  run each one separately , we need to export the suite:  suite.export module ;  We can run these tests individually by passing the test path as the argument:  $ vows test universe-test.js --spec ♢ Universe    the answer to the Universe √ shouldn't be undefined √ shouldn't be null √ should be a number √ should be 42  √ OK » 4 honored  0.007s   suite.addBatch {     'the answer': {         topic: 43,           ...     } } ;  ♢ Universe    the answer √ shouldn't be undefined  [ 165 ]  We will temporarily modify our topic to introduce an error as follows:  The output of the test will show which vows were honored and which failed,  displaying additional details for the broken vows. In this case, three vows   where honored and one was broken.   √ shouldn't be null √ should be a number  should be 42         » expected 42,     got    43  ==     universe-test.js:27   Broken » 3 honored ∙ 1 broken  0.564s   This simple example shows you how to create a suite, context, topics, and vows to  test a simple feature. We will use the same structure to test our heat map chart. Testing the heat map chart The tests for the heat map chart will be more involved than the test from the  previous example; for one thing, we need to load D3 and the windmill library   as Node modules.  D3 is a library that can be used to modify DOM elements based on data. In node  applications, we don't have a browser and the DOM doesn't exist. To have a  document with a DOM tree, we can use the JSDOM module. When we load D3   as a module, it creates the document and includes JSDOM for us; we don't need   to load JSDOM  or create the document and window objects .  To create a test for the heat map chart, we create the test chart heatmap-test.js  file and load the vows, assert, and d3 modules. We also load our charting library as  a local file:  We will also add a data array and use it later to create the charts. This array will be  accessible for the vows and contexts in the module, but it won't be exported.     Import the required modules var vows = require "vows" ,     assert = require "assert" ,     d3 = require "d3" ,     windmill = require ".. .. windmill" ;     Sample Data Array var data = [     {row: 1, column: 1, value: 5.5},     {row: 1, column: 2, value: 2.5},        ...     {row: 2, column: 4, value: 7.5} ];  [ 166 ]   The suite will contain tests for the heat map chart. We will describe the suite. It is not  necessary to describe the suite with the path to the method being tested, but it's a  good practice and helps you to locate errors when the tests don't pass.     Create a Test Suite for the heatmap chart var suite = vows.describe "windmill.chart.heatmap" ;  We will add a batch that contains the contexts to be tested. In the first context topic,  we will create a div element, create a chart with the default options, bind the data  array with the div element, and create a chart in the first context topic:     Append the Batches suite.addBatch {     "the default chart svg": {         topic: function   {                 Create the chart instance and a sample data array             var chart = windmill.chart.heatmap  ;                 Invoke the chart passing the container div             d3.select "body" .append "div"                  .attr "id", "default"                  .data [data]                  .call chart ;                 Return the svg element for testing             return d3.select "divdefault" .select "svg" ;         },             Vows...     } } ;  We will create vows to assert whether the svg element exists, its width and height  match the default values, it contains groups for the chart and axis, and the number   of rectangles match the number of elements in the data array:     Append the Batches suite.addBatch {     "the default chart svg": {         topic: function   {...},         "exists": function svg  {             assert.equal svg.empty  , false ;         },         "is 600px wide": function svg  {  [ 167 ]               assert.equal svg.attr 'width' , '600' ;         },         "is 300px high": function svg  {             assert.equal svg.attr 'height' , '300' ;         },         "has a group for the chart": function svg  {             assert.equal svg.select "g.chart" .empty  , false ;         },         "has a group for the xaxis": function svg  {             assert.equal svg.select "g.xaxis" .empty  , false ;         },         "has a group for the yaxis": function svg  {             assert.equal svg.select "g.yaxis" .empty  , false ;         },         "the group has one rectangle for each data item":  function svg  {             var rect = svg.select 'g' .selectAll "rect" ;             assert.equal rect[0].length, data.length ;         }     } } ;  We can run the test with vows and check whether the default attributes of the chart  are correctly set and the structure of the inner elements is organized as it should be:  $ vows test chart heatmap-test.js  --spec  ♢ windmill.chart.heatmap    the default chart svg √ exists √ is 600px wide √ is 300px high √ has a group for the chart √ has a group for the xaxis √ has a group for the yaxis √ the group has one rectangle for each data item  √ OK » 7 honored  0.075s   [ 168 ]  In a real-world application, we would have to add tests for many more configurations.   Testing the matrix layout The matrix layout is simpler to test, because we don't need the DOM or even D3.   We begin by importing the required modules and creating a suite, as follows:     Create the test suite var suite = vows.describe "windmill.layout.matrix" ;  We add a small data array to test the layout:     Create a sample data array var data = [     {a: 1, b: 1, c: 10},        ...     {a: 2, b: 2, c:  5} ];  We define an average function, as we did in the example file:  var avgerage = function values  {     var sum = 0;     values.forEach function d  { sum += d; } ;     return sum   values.length; };  We add a batch and a context to check the default layout attributes and generate the  layout in the context's topic:     Add a batch to test the default layout suite.addBatch {     "default layout": {         topic: function   {         return windmill.layout.matrix  ;     },  We add vows to test whether the layout is a function and has the row, column,   and value methods:          "is a function": function topic  {             assert.isFunction topic ;         },         "has a row method": function topic  {             assert.isFunction topic.row ;         },         "has a column method": function topic  {             assert.isFunction topic.column ;         },  [ 169 ]           "has a value method": function topic  {             assert.isFunction topic.value ;         }     } } ;  We can run the tests using vows test layout matrix-test.js --spec, but we  will automate the task of running the tests with Grunt. Running the tests with Grunt We will add a test task to the Gruntfile.js file in order to automate the execution  of tests. We will need to install the grunt-vows module:  $ npm install --save-dev grunt-vows  As usual, we need to enable the grunt-vows plugin in the Gruntfile.js file:         Enable the Grunt plugins     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-concat' ;        ...     grunt.loadNpmTasks "grunt-vows" ;  We will configure the task to run all the tests in the test directory. As we have done  when running the tests, we will add the spec option to obtain detailed reporting.  Removing this option will use the default value, displaying each test as a point in   the console:          vows: {             all: {                 options: {reporter: 'spec'},                 src: ['test *.js', 'test * *.js']             }         },  We could create additional targets to test the components individually as we modify  them. We can now run the task from the command line:  $ grunt vows  Running "vows:all"  vows  task   additional output not shown   Done, without errors.  Testing the code doesn't guarantee that you will have bug-free code, but it will  certainly help you to detect unexpected behaviors. A mature software usually   has thousands of tests. At the time of writing, for instance, D3 has about 2,500 tests.  [ 170 ]   Registering the sequences of tasks We have created and configured the essential tasks for our project, but we can  automate the process further. For instance, while modifying the code, we need to check  and test the code, but we won't need a minified version until we are ready to push the  changes to the repository. We will register two groups of tasks, test and build. The  test task will check the code, concatenate the source files, and run the tests. To register  a task, we give the task a name and add a list of the subtasks to be executed:         Test Task     grunt.registerTask 'test', ['jshint', 'concat', 'vows'] ;  We can execute the test task in the command line, triggering the jshint, concat,  and vows tasks in a sequence:  $ grunt test  We register the build task in a similar way; this task will run jshint, concat, vows,  and uglify in order, generating the files that we want to distribute:         Generate distributable files     grunt.registerTask 'build', ['jshint', 'vows', 'concat',     'uglify'] ;  A default task can be added too. We will add a default task that just runs the   build task:     Default task grunt.registerTask 'default', ['build'] ;  To run the default task, we invoke Grunt without arguments. There are hundreds of  Grunt plugins available; they can be used to automate almost everything. There are  plugins to optimize images, copy files, compile the LESS or SASS files to CSS, minify  the CSS files, monitor files for changes, and run tasks automatically, among many  others. We could automate additional tasks, such as updating the version number in  the source files or running tasks automatically when we modify source files.  The objective of automating tasks is not only to save time, but it also makes it   easier to actually do the tasks and establish a uniform workflow among peers.   It also allows developers to focus on writing code and makes the development  process more enjoyable.  [ 171 ]   Managing the frontend dependencies If our package is to be used in web applications, we should declare that it depends  on D3 and also specify the version of D3 that we need. For many years, projects just  declared their dependencies on their web page, leaving the task of downloading  and installing the dependencies to the user. Bower is a package manager for web  applications  http:  bower.io  . It makes the process of installing and updating  packages easier. Bower is a Node module; it can be installed either locally using npm,  as we did earlier in the chapter, or globally using npm install –g bower:  $ npm install --save bower  This will install Bower in the node_modules directory. We need to create a   bower.json file containing the package metadata and dependencies. Bower   can create this file for us:  $ bower init  This command will prompt us with questions about our package; we need to define  the name, version, main file, and keywords, among other fields. The generated file  will contain essential package information, as follows:  {     "name": "windmill",     "version": "0.1.0",     "authors": [         "Pablo Navarro"     ],     "description": "Heatmap Charts",     "main": "windmill.js",     "keywords": ["chart","heatmap","d3"],     "ignore": [         "** .*","** .*",         "node_modules",         "bower_components",         "app _bower_components",         "test",         "tests"     ],     "dependencies": {} }  [ 172 ]   Bower has a registry of frontend packages; we can use Bower to search the registry and  install our dependencies. For instance, we can search for the D3 package as follows:  $ bower search d3  Search results:      d3 git:  github.com mbostock d3.git      nvd3 git:  github.com novus nvd3      d3-plugins git:  github.com d3 d3-plugins.git     ...  The results are displayed, showing the package name and its Git endpoint. We can  use either the name or the endpoint to install D3:  $ bower install --save d3  This will create the bower_components directory  depending on your global  configuration  and update the bower.json file, including the D3 library in its most  recent release. Note that we included D3 both in our Node dependencies and in the  Bower dependencies. We included D3 in the Node dependencies to be able to test   our charts  which depend on D3 ; here, we include D3 as a frontend dependency,   so the other packages that use our charting package can download and install D3  using Bower:  {     "name": "windmill",     "version": "0.1.0",     ...     "dependencies": {         "d3": "~3.4.1"     } }  We can specify which version of the package we want to include. For instance, we  could have installed the release 3.4.0:  $ bower install d33.4.0  We don't need to register the packages to install them with Bower; we can use Bower  to install the unregistered packages using their Git endpoint:  $ bower install https:  github.com mbostock d3.git  [ 173 ]   The Git endpoint could also be a local repository, or even a ZIP or TAR file:  $bower install  path to package.zip  Bower will extract and copy each dependency in the bower_components directory.  To use the packages, we can use a reference to the bower_components directory,  or write a Grunt task to copy the files to another location. We will use the bower_ components directory to create example pages for our charts.  Using the package in other projects  In this section, we will create a minimal web page that uses the windmill package.  We begin by creating an empty directory, initializing the repository, and creating  a README.md file. We create the bower.json file using bower init. We will install  bootstrap to use it in our web page:  $ bower install --save bootstrap  This will download bootstrap and its dependencies to the bower_components  directory. We will install the windmill library using the Git endpoint of the repository:  $ bower install --save https:  github.com pnavarrc windmill.git  This will download the current version of windmill and the version of D3 on which  windmill depends. The contents of the bower_components directory are as follows:  In the index page, we will display the average wind speed in a certain city during  2013. We will store the data in the wind.csv file located in the data directory. The  CSV file has three columns that display the data  MM DD YY , the hour of the  measurement, and the average speed in meters per second:  bower_components     bootstrap     d3     jquery     windmill   Date,Hour,Speed 1 1 13,1,0.2554 1 1 13,2,0.1683 ...  [ 174 ]   In the header of the index file, we include D3 and the windmill CSS and   JavaScript files:  <link href=" bower_components windmill css windmill.css"  rel="stylesheet">         In the body of the page, we add the title and a container div:       Wind Speed          We create and configure the chart and layout. We want to display the average wind  speed by month and hour of the day. We set the rows to be the hours, the columns  to return the month number, and the value to return the speed. We will use the  average function to aggregate values with the same hour and month:             Aggregation function  average          function average values  {             var sum = 0;             values.forEach function d  { sum += d; } ;             return sum   values.length;         }             Matrix Layout         var matrix = windmill.layout.matrix               .row function d  { return +d.Hour; }              .column function d  { return +d.Date.getMonth  ; }              .value function d  { return +d.Speed; }              .aggregate average ;  We create and initialize the heat map chart, setting the width, height, and color  extent of the chart:             Create and configure the heatmap chart         var heatmap = windmill.chart.heatmap               .column function d  { return d.col; }              .width 700              .height 350              .colorExtent ['ccc', '222'] ;  [ 175 ]   We load the data using d3.csv and parse the dates. We select the container div and  bind the grouped data, as follows:     Load the CSV data d3.csv ' data wind.csv', function error, data  {         Handle errors getting or parsing the data     if  error  { return error; }            Parse the dates         data.forEach function d  {             d.Date = new Date d.Date ;         } ;         Create the heatmap chart in the container selection     d3.select 'divchart01'          .data [matrix data ]          .call heatmap ; } ;  The resulting chart will display the variations of wind speed as a function of the   hour of the day and the month. We can see that the wind is stronger between   2 pm and 8 pm and that it is weaker between March and September.  A heat map of the average wind speed by hour and month for 2013  [ 176 ]   Summary  In this chapter, we created a simple charting package with two components,   a layout and a heat map chart. We also discussed the workflow and tasks related  to the creation and distribution of a frontend package. We used Grunt with some  plugins to concatenate, check the code for errors, test, and minify the assets. We   used Vows to create test suites, and Bower to make our package easily installable   in third-party frontend projects.  We created a small project with a single web page, which includes the charting  package as an external dependency, and used it to visualize the average wind   speed by hour and month as a heat map.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to create a data-driven application using   third-party data and how to host the application using GitHub pages and Jekyll.  [ 177 ]    Data-driven Applications  In this chapter, we will create a data-driven application using data from the   Human Development Data API from the United Nations website. We will use D3   to create a reusable chart component, and use Backbone to structure and maintain  the application state. We will learn how to use Jekyll to create web applications  using templates and a simplified markup language. We will also learn how to host  our static site both on Amazon Simple Storage Service  S3  and GitHub Pages.  Creating the application In this section, we will create a data visualization to explore the evolution of   the Human Development Index  HDI  for different countries, and show the life  expectancy, education, and income components of the index. We will create the  visualization using D3 and Backbone.  The HDI is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income created to  compare and measure the quality of life in different countries. This indicator is used  by the United Nations Development Program to measure and report the progress of  the ranked countries in these areas.  In this visualization, we want to display how a particular country compares to other  ranked countries in the evolution of the index. We will use the Human Development  Data API to access the time series of the HDI for the ranked countries and to retrieve  information about their main components.   The chart will show the evolution of the HDI for all the ranked countries,  highlighting the selected country. In the right-hand side pane, we will display   the main components of the HDI: life expectancy at birth, mean and expected years  of schooling, and gross national income per capita  GNI . As there are almost two  hundred ranked countries, we will add a search form with autocompletion to search  among the countries. Selecting a country in the search input field will update the  chart and the right-hand side pane.  A screenshot of the visualization elements  We will implement our application using D3 and Backbone, following the same  pattern as presented in Chapter 6, Interaction between Charts. We will also leverage  other libraries to provide the design elements and the functionality that we need.  The project setup When creating software, we are continuously modifying our own work and the work  developed for others. The ability to control how those changes are integrated in the  project codebase and how to recover the previous versions is the heart of version  control systems. As with many other tools, there are plenty of tools available, each  with it's own characteristics.  [ 180 ]   Git is a popular version control system. It's distributed, which means that it's not  necessary to have a centralized location as the reference point; each working copy of  the repository can be used as a reference. In this section, we will use Git as a version  control system. We can't include an introduction to Git in this book; you can learn  about Git from its website  http:  git-scm.com .  Some content in this chapter is specific to Git and GitHub, a code-hosting repository  based on Git, specifically the sections on how to use GitHub Pages to host static  pages and the setup of the project. The example application can be implemented  even without a version control system or hosting service.  We will begin our application by creating a repository for it in GitHub. To create a  repository, go to http:  www.github.com, sign in with your account  or create an  account , and select +New repository. To create a repository, we will need to add a  name and description, and optionally, select a license and add a README file. After  doing this, the repository URL will be generated; we will use this URL to clone the  project and modify it. In our case, the URL of the repository is https:  github. com pnavarrc hdi-explorer.git. Cloning the repository will create a new  directory, containing the initial content set on GitHub, if any:  $ git clone https:  github.com pnavarrc hdi-explorer.git  Alternatively, we could have created an empty directory and initialized a Git  repository in it to begin working on it right away.  $ mkdir hdi-explorer  $ cd hdi-explorer  $ git init  If we decide to use GitHub, we can add a remote repository to push our code.  Remote repositories are locations on the Internet or in a network to make our  code accessible for others. It's customary to set the origin remote to the primary  repository for the project. We can set the origin remote and push the initial version  of our project by executing the following commands in the console:  $ git remote add origin https:  github.com pnavarrc hdi-explorer.git  $ git push -u origin  In either case, we will have a configured repository that is ready to be worked on.  [ 181 ]   As you may remember, we learned how to use Bower to manage the frontend  dependencies in Chapter 7, Creating a Charting Package. As we will be using several  libraries, we will begin by creating the bower.json file using bower init. We will set  the name, version, author, description, and home page of our project. Our bower.json  file will contain the basic information of our project as follows:  {   "name": "hdi-explorer"   "version": "0.1.0"   "authors": [     "Pablo Navarro  "   ],   "description": "Human Development Index Explorer"   "main": "index.html"   "homepage": "http:  pnavarrc.github.io hdi-explorer"   "private": true,   "dependencies": {} }  As mentioned before, we will use D3 and Backbone to create the charts and structure  our application. We will install the dependencies in our project:  $ bower install --save-dev d3 backbone underscore  This will create the bower_components directory and download the packages for  us. We will also need Bootstrap and Font Awesome to include the HDI component  icons. We will install these packages as well. As jQuery is a dependency of Bootstrap,  Bower will install it automatically:  $ bower install --save-dev bootstrap font-awesome typeahead.js  We will use the Typeahead library from Twitter to add autocompletion to   our search form. Installing packages with the --save-dev option will update  our bower.json file, adding the packages to the development dependencies.  These libraries would normally be regular dependencies; we are including them  as development dependencies because we will later create a file with all the  dependencies in that file.  {   "name": "hdi-explorer"      ...   "devDependencies": {     "d3": "~3.4.1"     "bootstrap": "~3.1.0"     "backbone": "~1.1.0"     "underscore": "~1.5.2"  [ 182 ]       "font-awesome": "~4.0.3"     "typeahead.js": "~0.10.0"   } }  Using Bower will help us to manage our dependencies and update the packages  without breaking our application. Bower requires its packages to adhere to   semantic version numbering, and it's smart enough to update only the  nonbackwards-incompatible releases.  Generating a static site with Jekyll In the previous chapters, we covered how to create data-driven applications and how  to use tools to make this task easier. In this section, we will cover how to generate  websites using Jekyll and host web applications using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.  Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator written in Ruby. This means   that we can create a website or blog without having to install and configure web  servers or databases to create our content. To create pages, we can write them in a  simple markup language and compile them in HTML. Jekyll also supports the use   of templates and partial HTML code to create the pages.  In Linux and OS X, we can install Jekyll from the command line. Remember that in  order to use Jekyll, Ruby and RubyGems should be installed. To install Jekyll, run  the following command in the console:  $ gem install jekyll  For other platforms and more installation options, refer to the documentation  available at http:  jekyllrb.com docs installation . Jekyll includes a  generator that configures and creates the project boilerplate with sample content  and templates  see jekyll new --help , but this time, we will create the templates,  content, and configuration from scratch. We will begin by creating the subdirectories  and files needed for the Jekyll components:  hdi-explorer     _includes        navbar.html    _layouts        main.html    _data     _drafts     _posts     index.md    _config.yml  [ 183 ]   The _config.yml file is a configuration file written in YAML, a serialization  standard similar to JSON but with additional types, support for comments, and  which uses indentation instead of brackets to indicate nesting  for more information,  see http:  www.yaml.org  . The content in this file defines how Jekyll will generate  the content and defines some site-wide variables. For our project, the _config.yml  file defines some Jekyll options and the name, base URL, and repository of our site:   Jekyll Configuration safe: true markdown: rdiscount permalink: pretty   Site name: Human Development Index Explorer baseurl: http:  pnavarrc.github.io hdi-explorer github: http:  github.com pnavarrc hdi-explorer.git  The safe option disables all the Jekyll plugins, the markdown option sets the  markdown language that we will use, and the permalink option defines which   kind of URL we want to generate. There are additional options to set the time   zone and excluded files, among others.  The _layouts directory will contain page templates with placeholders to be replaced  by content. On each page, we can declare which layout we will use in a special area  called the YAML front matter, which we will describe later. The templates can have  variables, such as the {{ content }} tag, and include the {% include navbar. html %} tag. The content of the variables is defined either in the front matter or in  the _config.yml file. The include tags replace the block with the content of the  corresponding file in the _includes directory. For instance, our main.html template  contains the following base page structure:               {{ page.title }}                {% include navbar.html %}       [ 184 ]           {{ content }}          The value of the {{ site.baseurl }} variable is set in the _config.yml file,   the {{ page.title }} variable will use the value of the font matter of the pages  using the template, and the {{ content }} variable will be replaced with the  content of the files that use the template. In the _config.yml file, we defined the  baseurl variable to http:  pnavarrc.github.io hdi-explorer. When Jekyll   uses this template to generate content, it will replace the {{ site.baseurl }}  variable with http:  pnavarrc.github.io hdi-explorer, and the generated   page will have the complete URL for the CSS style, http:  pnavarrc.github.io  hdi-explorer hdi.css. A complete reference to the Liquid Templating language   is available at http:  liquidmarkup.org .  The _includes directory contains the HTML fragments to be included in other  pages. This is useful to modularize some parts of our page, such as to separate the  footer, header, or navigation bar. Here, we created the navbar.html file with the  content of our navigation bar:                     {{ site.name }}               The content of the navbar.html file will replace the {% include navbar.html %}  liquid tag in the templates. The files in the _includes directory can also contain  liquid tags, which will be replaced properly.  The _posts directory contains blog posts. Each blog post should be a file with a  name in the YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKDOWN form. Jekyll will use the filename  to compute the date and URL of each post. The _data directory contains additional  site-wide variables, and the _draft directory contains posts that we will want to  publish later. In this project, we won't create posts or drafts.  [ 185 ]   The index.md file contains content to be rendered using some of the layouts in the  project. The beginning of the file contains the YAML front matter, that is, the lines  between three dashes. This fragment of the file is interpreted as YAML code and  is used to render the templates. For instance, in the main template, we had the {{  page.title }} placeholder. When rendering the page, Jekyll will replace this with  the title variable in the page's front matter. The content after the front matter will  replace the {{ content }} tag in the template.  --- layout: main title: HDI Explorer ---    Hello World  We can add any number of variables to the front matter, but the layout variable is  mandatory; so, Jekyll knows which layout should be used to render the page. In this  case, we will use the main.html layout and set the title of the page to HDI Explorer.  The content of the page can be written in HTML or in text-to-HTML languages, such  as Markdown or Textile. Once we have created the layouts and initial content, we can  use Jekyll to generate the site.  $ jekyll build  This will create the _site directory, which contains all the content of the directory  except the Jekyll-related directories such as _layouts and _includes. In our case,  it will generate a directory containing an index.html file. This file is the result of  injecting the contents of the index.md, navbar.html, and _config.yml files in the  main.html layout. The generated file will look as follows:               HDI Explorer    <link href="http:  pnavarrc.github.io hdi-explorer hdi.css"  rel="stylesheet">                                    [ 186 ]             Human Development Index Explorer                                               Hello World           We can see that the generated file is pure HTML. Using Jekyll allows us to modularize  the page, separate its components, and allows us to focus on writing the actual content  of each page.  Jekyll also allows us to serve the generated pages locally, watching for changes   in the project files. To do this, we need to overwrite the baseurl variable in order   to use the localhost address instead of the value defined in the configuration file.   As the addresses will be relative to the project directory, we can set the base URL   to an empty string:  $ jekyll serve --watch --baseurl=  We can now access our site by pointing the browser to http:  localhost:4000 and  use our site. In the next section, we will create the contents of our application using  D3 and Backbone, integrating the JavaScript files, styles, and markup with the Jekyll  templates and pages created in this section.  Creating the application components We will separate the Backbone application components from the chart; we will put  the models, collections, views, and setup in the js app directory:  js    app      models        app.js       country.js     collections        countries.js  [ 187 ]       views        country.js       countries.js     app.js     setup.js     Application container var app = {};  In the app.js file, we just define a variable that will have the components of   our application:  The setup.js file contains the creation of the model, collection, and view instances;  the binding of the events; and the callbacks of different components. We will review  the models, collections, and views in detail later.  Creating the models and collections The application model will reflect the application state. In our application, the  selected country defines the state of the application; we will use three-letter   country codes as the only attribute of the application model:     Application Model app.ApplicationModel = Backbone.Model.extend {        Code of the Selected Country     defaults: {         code: ''     } } ;  We will have two additional models: the CountryInformation model will   represent information about the current HDI value and its main components,   and the CountryTrend model will contain information about the country and   time series of HDI measurements.  The data source for these models will be an endpoint of the Human Development  Data API. The API allows us to retrieve data about poverty, education, health,  social integration, and migrations, among many others. A complete list of the API  endpoints and some examples of queries are available at the Human Development  Data API website  http:  hdr.undp.org en data api . The API exposes the data  in several formats and receives parameters to filter the data.  [ 188 ]   The CountryInformation model will retrieve information about the Human  Development Index and its Components endpoint. For instance, we can access this  endpoint by passing name=Germany as the parameter of the request. The request to  http:  data.undp.org resource wxub-qc5k.json?name=Germany will return a  JSON file with the main components of the HDI:  [    {     "_2011_expected_years_of_schooling_note" :"e",     "_2012_life_expectancy_at_birth" :"80.6",     "_2012_gni_per_capita_rank_minus_hdi_rank" :"10",     "_2012_hdi_value" :"0.920",     "type" : "Ranked Country",     "abbreviation" : "DEU",     "_2010_mean_years_of_schooling" :"12.2",     "_2011_expected_years_of_schooling" :"16.4",     "name" : "Germany",     "_2012_hdi_rank" :"5",     "_2012_gross_national_income_gni_per_capita" :"35431",     "_2012_nonincome_hdi_value" :"0.948"   } ]  We will define the model such that it has the name and code attributes and some  of the information provided by the JSON file. We will add the url, baseurl, and  urltpl attributes to construct the URL for each country, as follows:     Country Information Model app.CountryInformation = Backbone.Model.extend {         Default attributes, the name and code of the country     defaults: {         code: '',          name: ''     },         URL to fetch the model data     url: '',         Base URL     baseurl: 'http:  data.undp.org resource wxub-qc5k.json',         URL Template     urltpl: _.template ' ?Abbreviation= '  } ;  [ 189 ]   Each country has the abbreviation field; this field contains the code for the country.  We will use this code as the ID of the country. The names of the attributes of the JSON  object contain data; for instance, the _2012_life_expectancy_at_birth attribute  contains the year of the measurement. If we create an instance of the model and  invoke its fetch method, it will retrieve the data from the JSON endpoint and add  attributes to each attribute of the retrieved object. This will be a problem because the  endpoint returns an array and not all the countries have up-to-date measurements. In  the case of Germany, the only object in the array has the _2012_life_expectancy_ at_birth attribute, but in the case of other countries, the most recent measurements  could be from 2010.  To have a uniform representation of the data, we can strip the year out of the attribute  names before we set the attributes for the model. We can do this by setting the parse  method, which is invoked when the data is fetched from the server. In this method, we  will get the first element of the retrieved array and strip the first part of the attributes  beginning with _ to only have attributes of the form life_expectancy_at_birth:         Parse the response and set the model contents     parse: function response  {             Get the first item of the response         var item = response.pop  ,             data = {                 code: item.abbreviation,                  name: item.name             };             Parse each attribute         for  var attr in item  {             if  attr[0] === '_'  {                    Extract the attribute name after the year                 data[attr.slice 6 ] = item[attr];             }         }             Return the parsed data         return data;     }  [ 190 ]   We will also add a method to update the model with the selected country in the  application. The setState method will receive the application model and use its  code attribute to construct the URL for the selected country and to fetch the new  information, as follows:  setState: function state  {        Construct the URL and fetch the data     this.url = this.urltpl {         baseurl: this.baseurl,          code: state.get 'code'      } ;     this.fetch {reset: true} ; }  We will create the CountryTrend model to store the trends of the HDI for each  country, and the Countries collection to store the CountryTrend instances. The  CountryTrend model will hold the country code and name, a flag to indicate whether  the country has been selected or not, and a series of HDI measurements for different  years. We will use the code of the country as an ID attribute:     Country Trend Model app.CountryTrend = Backbone.Model.extend {         Default values for the Country Trend Model     defaults: {         name: '',         code: '',         selected: false,         hdiSeries: []     },         The country code identifies uniquely the model     idAttribute: 'code' } ;  [ 191 ]   The Countries collection will contain a set of the CountryTrend instances. The  collection will have an endpoint to retrieve the information for the model instances.  We will need to define the parse method in the CountryTrend model, which will  be invoked automatically before new CountryTrend instances are generated. In the  parse method, we construct an object with the attributes of the new model instance.  The data retrieved for the collection will have the following structure:  {   _1990_hdi: "0.852"   _1980_hdi: "0.804"   _2000_hdi: "0.922"      ...   _2012_hdi: "0.955" }  Here, the year of the HDI measurement is contained in the key of the object. There  are other attributes also, which we will ignore. We will split the attribute name using  the _ character to extract the year:         Parse the country fields before instantiating the model     parse: function response  {          var data = {             code: response.country_code,             name: response.country_name,             selected: false,             hdiSeries: []         };             Compute the HDI Series         for  var attr in response  {             var part = attr.split '_' ,                 series = [];              if   part.length === 3  &&  part[2] === 'hdi'   {                 data.hdiSeries.push {                     year: parseInt part[1], 10 ,                     hdi: parseFloat response[attr]                  } ;             }         }             Sort the data items         data.hdiSeries.sort function a, b  {              return b.year - a.year;          } ;          return data;     }  [ 192 ]   The data object will contain the country's code, name, the selected flag, and the  array of hdiSeries, which will contain objects that have the year and HDI value.  The Countries collection will contain the CountryTrend instances for each country.  The data will be retrieved from the Human Development Index Trends endpoint.  We set the collection model, the endpoint URL, and a parse method, which will   filter the items that have a country code  there are items for groups of countries .   We will also add a method to set a selected item in order to ensure that there is   only one selected item:     Countries Collection app.Countries = Backbone.Collection.extend {         Model     model: app.CountryTrend,         JSON Endpoint URL     url: 'http:  data.undp.org resource efc4-gjvq.json',         Remove non-country items     parse: function response  {         return response.filter function d  {              return d.country_code;          } ;     },         Set the selected country     setSelected: function code  {          var selected = this.findWhere {selected: true} ;          if  selected  {              selected.set 'selected', false ;          }             Set the new selected item         selected = this.findWhere {code: code} ;         if  selected  {             selected.set 'selected', true ;          }     } } ;  We will proceed to create the views for the models.  [ 193 ]   Creating the views The application will have three views: the chart with the trends of HDI values for the  ranked countries, the information view at the right-hand side, and the search form.  CountriesTrendView is a view of the Countries collection, which displays the  evolution of the HDI for the ranked countries. As we did in Chapter 6, Interaction  between Charts, we will create a Backbone View that will contain an instance of a   D3-based chart:     Countries Trend View app.CountriesTrendView = Backbone.View.extend {         Initialization and render     initialize: function   {         this.listenTo this.collection, 'reset', this.render ;         this.listenTo this.collection, 'change:selected', this. render ;     } } ;  In the initialize method, we start listening for the reset event of the collection  and the change:selected event, which are triggered when an element of the  collection is selected. In both cases, we will render the view. We will add and  configure an instance of the D3-based chart, hdi.chart.trends:  app.CountriesTrendView = Backbone.View.extend {          Initalization and render...         Initialize the trend chart     chart: hdi.chart.trend           .series function d  { return d.hdiSeries; }          .x function d  { return d.year; }          .y function d  { return d.hdi; } ,         Initialize and render methods... } ;  We will skip the description of the hdi.chart.trend chart for brevity, but as usual,  the chart is implemented using the reusable chart pattern and has accessor methods  to configure its behavior. The chart displays the time series of HDI measurements for  all the ranked countries, highlighting the line bound to a data item with the selected  attribute set to true.  [ 194 ]   The HDI trend chart  In the render method, we get the width of the container element of the view and  update the width of the chart using this value. We select the container element,   bind the collection data to the selection, and invoke the chart:         Update the chart width and bind the updated data     render: function   {            Update the width of the chart         this.chart.width this.$el.width   ;              Rebind and render the chart         d3.select this.el              .data [this.collection.toJSON  ]              .call this.chart ;     },  [ 195 ]   We will also add the setState method to change the selected country of the  underlying collection. This method will help us to update the selected item of the  collection when the application model changes the selected country. We will do this  later in the application setup:         Update the state of the application model     setState: function state  {         this.collection.setSelected state.get 'code'  ;     }  The search form will allow the user to search among the ranked countries to select one  of them. We will use the Typeahead jQuery plugin from Twitter  http:  twitter. github.io typeahead.js   to provide autocompletion, and we will populate the  suggestion list with the items in the Countries collection. The Typeahead plugin  contains two components: Bloodhound, the autocompletion engine, and Typeahead,  the plugin that adds autocompletion capabilities to an input field.  In the initialize method, we bind the reset event of the collection to the render  method in order to update the view when the list of country trends is retrieved:     Search Form View app.CountriesSearchView = Backbone.View.extend {         Initialize     initialize: function   {         this.listenTo this.collection, 'reset', this.render ;     },         Events and render methods... } ;  The DOM element associated with this view will be a div containing the search form,  which is located in the navigation bar. We assign an ID to the div and to the input field:      <input type="text" class="form-control typeahead"          placeholder="Search country"id="search-country-input">    To provide autocompletion, we need to initialize the autocompletion engine and add  the autocompletion features to the search input item:         Render the component     render: function   {            Initialize the autocompletion engine            Add autocompletion to the input field     },  [ 196 ]   We initialize the Typeahead autocompletion engine; setting the datumTokenizer  option is a function that, given a data element, returns a list of strings that should be  associated with the element. In our case, we want to match the country names; so,  we use the whitespace tokenizer and return the country name split by whitespace  characters. The input of the search field will be split using whitespace characters too.  We add the list of elements among which we want to search, which in our case are  the elements in the collection:         Render the component     render: function   {            Initialize the autocompletion engine         this.engine = new Bloodhound {             datumTokenizer: function d  {                  return Bloodhound.tokenizers.whitespace d.name ;              },             queryTokenizer: Bloodhound.tokenizers.whitespace,             local: this.collection.toJSON           } ;         this.engine.initialize  ;             Add autocompletion to the input field...     },  To add the autocompletion features to the search form, we select the input element of  the view and configure the typeahead options. In our case, we just want to show the  name of the country and use the engine dataset as the source for the autocompletion:             Render the element         this.$el.children 'search-country-input'              .typeahead null, {                 displayKey: 'name',                 source: this.engine.ttAdapter               } ;  When the user begins to type in the input field, the options that match the input will  be displayed. When the user selects an option, the typeahead:selected event will  be triggered by the input element. We will add this to the event's hash of the view,  binding the event to the setSelected callback:      events: {         'typeahead:selected input[type=text]': 'setSelected'     },  [ 197 ]   Note that the typeahead:selected event is a jQuery event. The callback will receive  the event and the data item selected by the user, and it will update the selected item  in the collection, as follows:          Update the selected item in the collection     setSelected: function event, datum  {         this.collection.setSelected datum.code ;     }  The Typeahead autocompletion in action  The last view will be CountryInformationView. This view is a visual representation  of the CountryInformation model. For this view, we will add the _includes  country-information.html file with the contents of the template and include   it in the index.md file:  --- layout: main title: HDI Explorer ---  {% include country-information.html %}     The template will contain several internal div elements; we will show only a part of  the template here:                  [ 198 ]                                   human development index                  human development index                           hdi rank                      Here, we create the structure of the bar on the right-hand side, which will contain the  Human Development Index, rank, life expectancy, education statistics, and income  for the selected country. We will use the Underscore templates to render this view.  The view structure is simpler in this case; we just compile the template, listen to the  changes of country name in the model, and render the template with the model data:     Country Information View app.CountryInformationView = Backbone.View.extend {        View template     template: _.template $ 'country-summary-template' .html   ,      initialize: function   {            Update the view on name changes         this.listenTo this.model, 'change:name', this.render ;     },      render: function   {  [ 199 ]              Render the template         this.$el.html this.template this.model.toJSON    ;     } } ;  The rendered view will display the current values for the HDI components  The application setup With the models, collections, and views created, we can create the respective  instances and bind events to callbacks in order to keep the views in sync. We begin  by creating an instance of the application model and the collection of country HDI  trends. In the js app setup.js file, we create and configure the model, collection,  and view instances:     Application Model app.state = new app.ApplicationModel  ;     HDI Country Trends Collection app.countries = new app.Countries  ;  [ 200 ]   After the application's state changes, we will have to update the selected item in the  Countries collection. We bind the change:code event of the application model to  the callback that will update the selected item in the collection:     Update the selected item in the countries collection app.countries.listenTo app.state, 'change:code', function state {     this.setSelected state.get 'code'  ; } ;  We need to update the application state when the Countries collection is populated  for the first time. We will set the application state's code attribute to the code of the  first element in the collection of countries. We also bind the change:selected event  of the collection to update the application model:  app.countries.on {     'reset': function   {         app.state.set 'code', this.first  .get 'code'  ;     },      'change:selected': function   {         var selected = this.findWhere {selected: true} ;         if  selected  {             app.state.set 'code', selected.get 'code'  ;         }     } } ;  Note that when we are selecting an item, we are also deselecting another item. Both  the items will trigger the change:selected event, but the application should change  its state only when an item is selected. We can now fetch the countries data, passing  the reset flag to ensure that any existing data is overwritten:  app.countries.fetch {reset: true} ;  We create an instance of the CountryInformation model and bind the changes to the  code attribute of the application to the changes of the state in the model. The setState  method will fetch the information for the code given by the application state:     HDI Information app.country = new app.CountryInformation  ; app.country.listenTo app.state, 'change:code', app.country.setState ;  [ 201 ]   We can now create instances of the views. We will create an instance of the  CountriesTrendView. This view will be rendered in the div element with   the chart ID:     Countries Trend View app.trendView = new app.CountriesTrendView {     el: $ 'divchart' ,     collection: app.countries } ;  We create an instance and configure the CountriesSearchView. This view will be  rendered in the navigation bar:  app.searchView = new app.CountriesSearchView {     el: $ 'search-country' ,     collection: app.countries } ;  We also create a CountryInformationView instance, which will be rendered in the  right-hand side of the page:  app.infoView = new app.CountryInformationView {     el: $ 'divtable' ,     model: app.country } ;  In the index.md file, we create the elements where the views will be rendered and  include the application files. In the main.html layout, we include the CSS styles of  the application, Bootstrap and Font Awesome:  --- layout: main title: HDI Explorer ---  {% include country-information.html %}                       [ 202 ]                 The application served by Jekyll on a localhost  Here, we consolidated jQuery, Bootstrap, Underscore, Backbone, Typeahead, and D3  in the dependencies.min.js file and the application models, collections, views, and  chart in the hdi.min.js file. To create these consolidated files, we created a Gruntfile  and configured concatenation and minification tasks as we did in Chapter 7, Creating  a Charting Package. As the configuration of the tasks is similar to the configuration  presented in the previous chapter, we will skip its description.  It is also worth mentioning that in general, it is not a good practice to include complete  libraries. For instance, we included the complete Bootstrap styles and JavaScript  components, but in the application, we used only a small part of the features.  Bootstrap allows you to include the components individually, reducing the payload  of the page and improving the performance. We also included the Font Awesome  fonts and styles only to include four icons. In a project where performance is crucial,  we will probably include only the components that we really need.  [ 203 ]   Hosting the visualization with GitHub  Pages  In the previous section, we created a web application using Jekyll, Backbone, and  D3. With Jekyll, we created a template for the main page and included the minified  JavaScript libraries and styles. With Jekyll, we can compile the markup files to  generate a static website or serve the site without generating a static version using  jekyll serve. In this section, we will publish our site using GitHub Pages, a  hosting service for personal and project sites. GitHub Pages is a service from GitHub that provides hosting for static websites  created in Jekyll or HTML. To publish our Jekyll site, we need to create a branch  named gh-pages and push the branch to GitHub. If this branch is a Jekyll project or  contains an index.html file, GitHub will serve the content of this branch as a static  site. We can create the branch from the master branch: $ git checkout -b gh-pages  Next, push the branch to our origin, the GitHub endpoint:  $ git push -u origin gh-pages  This will push the gh-pages branch to GitHub, and GitHub Pages will generate  the site in a few minutes. The application will be published and will be accessible  through an URL of the form http:  user.github.io project-name, in our case,  http:  pnavarrc.github.io hdi-explorer. It's important to remember that the  base URL for the project will be http:  user.github.io project-name. Set the  baseurl variable in the _config.yml file correctly to avoid path problems with the  styles and JavaScript files.  The published version of the HDI Explorer application  [ 204 ]   We can create personal pages as well, but in this case, we would need to create a  repository with a name of the form user.github.io, and the site will be a server  from the http:  user.github.io URL. GitHub Pages also allows you to use  custom domains and plain HTML instead of Jekyll. More information about   GitHub Pages can be found in the project site at http:  pages.github.com .  Hosting the visualization in Amazon S3  As an alternative to publishing our pages using GitHub Pages, we can also serve  static sites using Amazon S2. Amazon S3 is a data storage service provided by  Amazon. It can be used to store files of any kind, and in particular, to store and   serve static websites. Amazon S3 stores data with 99.99 percent availability and  scales well in terms of storage capacity, number of requests, and users. It also  provides fine-grained control access, allowing you to store sensible data.  The pricing depends on how much data you store and how many access requests  are made, but it starts at less than 0.1 USD per GB per month, and there is a free tier  available to use the platform at no charge to store up to 5 GB  and 20,000 requests  per month . In this section, we will assume that you have an Amazon Web Services  account. If you don't, you can sign up at http:  aws.amazon.com  and create   an account. In Amazon S3, the files are stored in buckets. A bucket is a container for objects.  Buckets are stored in one of several regions; the region is usually chosen to optimize  the latency or to minimize costs. The name of the bucket needs to be unique among  the buckets in Amazon.  To host our site, we will create a bucket. To create the bucket, we need to go   to the Amazon S3 console at https:  console.aws.amazon.com and select   Create Bucket. Here, we need to name our bucket and assign it a region. We will  name it hdi-explorer and select the default region. When the bucket is created,   we select the bucket and go to Properties. In the Static Website Hosting section,   we can enable the hosting and retrieve the URL of our bucket. We will use this   URL as the base URL of the site.  [ 205 ]   Configuring Jekyll to deploy files to S3 To deploy static content to Amazon S3, we need to generate a version of the site with  the baseurl variable set to the Amazon S3 endpoint. We will create an alternate  Jekyll configuration file and use it to generate the S3 version of the site. In this case,  we only need to update the base URL of the site, but this new file can have different  configuration values. We will create the _s3.yml file with the following options:   Jekyll Configuration safe: true markdown: rdiscount permalink: pretty destination: _s3 exclude:     - bower_components     - node_modules     - Gruntfile.js     - bower.json     - package.json     - README.md  Site name: Human Development Index Explorer baseurl: http:  hdi-explorer.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com  We set the destination folder to _s3. This will generate the files that we need to  deploy to Amazon in the _s3 directory. We have also excluded the files that are not  needed to serve the page. We can now use this configuration to build the D3 version  of the site:  $ jekyll build --config _s3.yml  We can check whether the links in the generated files point towards the S3 endpoint.  Uploading the site to the S3 bucket We can upload the files using the web interface in the Amazon AWS console;  however, the interface doesn't allow you to upload complete directories. Instead,  we will use s3cmd, a command-line tool that helps to upload, download, and sync  directories with S3 Buckets. To download and install s3cmd, follow the instructions  available on the project website  http:  s3tools.org s3cmd .  [ 206 ]   Before uploading the files, we need to configure s3cmd to provide the Amazon  security credentials. To generate new access keys, go to your account, then go to  security credentials, and then select Access Keys. You can generate a new pair of  access key ID and secret. These strings allow you to authenticate applications to  access your S3 Buckets.  With the access key and secret, we can configure s3cmd to use it to upload our files:  $ s3cmd --configure  This command will request for our access key ID and secret. We can now upload the  files. As we just want to upload our files, we can simply use the following command:  $ s3cmd sync _s3  s3:  bucket-name  The first time, this will upload the files to your bucket. Once you have the content in  S3, it will keep the bucket synchronized with the _s3 directory and upload only the  files that have changed.  Finally, we need to make our files public so that everyone with the URL can access  the application. To do this, go to the bucket page in the browser, select all the files,  and select Make Public in the Actions menu. The site will now be available at the  bucket endpoint URL.  Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to create static sites with Jekyll and how to integrate  third-party data sources using API endpoints. We used the Human Development  Data API from the United Nations to visualize the evolution of the HDI of the ranked  countries, displaying the main components of this indicator as a table.  To create the application, we used several JavaScript and CSS libraries, and we used  Grunt to concatenate and minify the project assets before publishing the site. We also  learned how to publish sites created with Jekyll using GitHub Pages for projects or  personal pages, and how to configure and use Amazon S3 to host static websites.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to create data visualization dashboards and  how to make our visualizations responsive.  [ 207 ]    Creating a Dashboard  Dashboards are a special kind of data visualization. They are widely used to monitor  website analytics, business intelligence metrics, and brand presence in social media,  among many other things. Dashboards are especially difficult to design, because a  great amount of information should be displayed in a limited amount of space.  In this chapter, we will define what a dashboard is and discuss some of the strategies  and design patterns that can help us design an effective dashboard. We will design  and create a dashboard to monitor the performance of students in a class.  Defining a dashboard  Before we create our dashboard, it will be useful to clarify what a dashboard is. A  quick search on Google Images will reveal that there isn't any consistent definition of  what a dashboard is. Most of the results are a collection of charts, tables, gauges, and  indicators that seem intended to monitor business performance, website analytics,  and presence of a brand in social media, among many other things. Stephen Few, a  specialist in business intelligence and information design, provides a great definition  of dashboards:  A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve  one or more objectives, which is consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the  information can be monitored at a glance.   This definition has several implications. First, dashboards are visual displays of  information. A dashboard can contain text elements, but it's mainly a visual display.  Well-designed graphics and charts are a highly effective medium to communicate  quantitative information. Suppose we have a list with the monthly sales of a person  in value and units sold. We can display this information in a table, as follows:  Series of sales shown as a table  We can also create a line chart with the same information. The following image  displays the same data in a visual form. We have two lines and their corresponding  axes, one for the units sold and another for the value of the monthly sales.  Series of sales, this time as a line chart  In the line chart, we can easily spot seasonal changes in the sales, find the minimum  or maximum value, and identify patterns and changes in sales. Of course, if we need  precision, we will need the table, but if we need to detect changes quickly, the chart  is a better choice.  Dashboards should be designed with a purpose in mind. If our dashboard shows  general information, it won't be useful. We should know what kind of decisions will  be made, which problems need to be detected, and what information will help the  dashboard users make decisions and take action.  [ 210 ]   The dashboard should display the most important information that is needed to  achieve its purpose. This means that it should gather all the relevant data, perhaps  from different sources, to help decision makers detect problems.  The previous definition of dashboards states that the information  in a dashboard should be arranged in a single screen, or more  generally, the dashboard should fit in the eye span of the user. This  is important in order to provide an overall view. The information  should be visible at all times, and the user shouldn't have to scroll  the page to view a chart or click on something to have a modal  window with additional information.  In the next section, we will design and create a dashboard to monitor the  performance of students in a class. We will state the purpose of our dashboard,   list the relevant information that we need, organize this information in sections,   and create charts for each section in order to finally organize our information to   help the user detect problems and take actions to solve them.  Good practices in dashboard design  When designing a dashboard, we need to get the most out of each section of the  screen so that we can design our graphics to maximize the absorption of information.  Some visual attributes are more easily perceived than others, and some of them  can communicate effectively without having to pay full attention to them. These  attributes are called preattentive attributes of visual perception. We will discuss  some of them in the context of dashboard design:     Color: There are several ways to describe color. One of the color models is   called the HSL model, which is better for humans to understand. In this  model, the color is described by three attributes, hue  what we usually call  color , saturation  intensity of a color , and lightness or brightness. The  perception of color depends on the context. A light color will draw attention  if it's surrounded by dark colors; a highly saturated blue will be flashy if  the background is a pale color. The dashboard should guide the viewer's  attention to issues that require action. To achieve this, we need to choose the  colors wisely, reserving colors with high contrast to elements and areas that  deserve special attention.  [ 211 ]      Form: Length, width, and size can encode quantitative dimensions   effectively, with different degrees of precision. We can quickly determine  whether a line is twice the length of another, but it can be more difficult to  determine this with the width or the size of circles. Items of different shapes  are perceived as belonging to different categories or kinds of elements.     Position: The position of items plays an important role in the communication   of information. Scatter plots encode pairs of values with two-dimensional  positions; we are inclined to think that items that are close are related.  Position can also encode hierarchy. Higher items are considered better or  more important than items below them, and items located on the left-hand  side will be seen first if the viewer's language is written from left to right.  We can use all these elements to design the components of our dashboard so the  viewer's attention is directed to the issues that require action. As dashboards usually  contain a huge amount of information, every inch of the screen counts. In desktop  environments, the horizontal space is usually enough, but the vertical space is  scarce. In mobile environments, there is usually more vertical space, but the overall  available space is more challenging.  To use the available space efficiently, we need to select the information that really  counts, and prefer compact charts and graphics. It is essential to use charts and  graphics that are clear and direct, reducing explicit decoding to the absolute minimum.  The dashboard should be well organized in order to allow the user to quickly   locate each piece of information. We will use the aforementioned visual attributes   to establish a clear hierarchy between elements and clearly define sections dedicated  to displaying information about the students, courses, and the entire class.  These are just a few guidelines that should be considered when creating a dashboard;  for more in-depth treatment, please refer to Information Dashboard Design by Stephen  Few  see the reference in Chapter 1, Data Visualization .  Making a dashboard  As we mentioned previously, designing an effective dashboard is a challenging task.  The first step to create a useful dashboard is to determine which questions need to be  answered by the dashboard, which problems need to be detected on time, and why a  dashboard is required.  Once we have determined the purpose of the dashboard, we can begin to gather all  the data that can help us answer the questions and understand the issues stated in  the dashboard purpose. The data can be originated from several sources.  [ 212 ]   We will then need to organize the information in meaningful sections in order to  help the user easily navigate the dashboard and find the required information.  We will also need to choose the visual displays for each piece of data that we want  to put in the dashboard. We need to choose compact displays that are familiar to the  user in order to minimize the amount of effort taken in decoding the information.  In this section, we will design and implement a dashboard to monitor the performance  of students in a class. We will define the purpose of the dashboard, gather the  necessary datasets, choose the charts and graphics that we will use, and organize the  information in sections dedicated to the students, courses, and the entire class.  The dashboard that monitors the performance of students in a class  As the main topic in this section is the design of dashboards and we have created  several charts previously, we won't include the code for the examples. The code for  the charts, each section, and the complete dashboard is available in the chapter09  directory of the code bundle.  Defining the purpose of the dashboard The dashboard should be an overall view of the performance of the students in a  class. If the scores of all the students in a given course are declining, there might  be a problem with the methodology chosen by the teacher; if the scores of just one  of the students are dropping, that student might be having personal issues that  are interfering with his her learning. The aim of the dashboard is to display all  the information in order to easily detect problems and make decisions to help the  students or teachers improve the learning process.  [ 213 ]   A teacher will want to detect drops in performance at three levels: an individual  student, the students in a course, or the students in all the courses at the same time.  Besides detecting learning problems, it would be useful to have information that  helps identify possible causes of bad performance. The specific objectives of our  dashboard will be as follows:     Assess the performance of each student in a course. The most obvious way to  do this is to display the scores of the students in each class. We might want to  identify possible causes of bad performance, such as repeated absences.     Monitor the aggregated performance of the students in each course. This will  allow us to take action if a great number of students are having issues with a  particular subject.     Get an overall measure of the performance of the complete class. This will   help us detect problems that could affect the class as a group.  We will need to gather the students' data and decide which information is relevant in  order to achieve these objectives.  Obtaining the data As we mentioned earlier, we need to monitor the performance of the students,  courses, and the entire class. For this example, the data will be generated with a  script. We will need the absences and scores of the students for each course. We   will assume that we have a JSON endpoint that provides us with the students'   data in the following format:  [   {     id: 369     name: 'Adam Lewis',     absences: [ ... ],     courses: [ ... ],     avgScore: 58.84   },   {     id: 372     name: 'Abigail Bower',     absences: [ ... ],     courses: [ ... ],     avgScore: 67.78   },   ... ]  [ 214 ]   For each student, we will have the name and id attributes. We will also have an  absences attribute, which will contain just a list of dates on which the student   didn't show up to class:  We will also need the scores of the students in their courses. The courses field will  contain a list of the students' courses, and each course will have the course's name  and a list of the scores obtained by the student in the assignments or assessments. For  convenience, we will also add the average score of the students for the current period:  {   name: 'Adam Lewis',   absences: [     '2013-09-06',      '2013-10-04',     ...   ],   ... }  {   name: 'Adam Lewis',   absences: [ ... ],   courses: [     {       name: 'Mathematics',       scores: [         {date: '2013-09-23', score: 78},         {date: '2013-10-04', score: 54},         ...       ]     },     {       name: 'Art',       scores: [...]     }   ],   avgScore: 58.84 }  [   {     name: 'Mathematics',     avgScores: [  [ 215 ]  We will also need information about the courses of the students. We will assume that  there is a JSON endpoint that provides us with information about the courses:         {date: '2013-09-18', score: 72.34},       {date: '2013-10-07', score: 64.45},       ...     ],     avgScore: 63.21   },   {     name: 'Arts',     avgScores: [       {date: '2013-09-16', score: 76.62},       {date: '2013-10-01', score: 58.53},       ...   ],   avgScore: 63.21   } ]  The avgScores attribute will contain a list with the dates of assessment and the  average score obtained by the students. The avgScore attribute will contain the  average of the scores for all the assessments in the current period.  Organizing the information The next step is to organize the information in logical units. Each section of the  dashboard should help us detect the issues that require attention.  In our example, the organization of the information is fairly direct; there will be  sections for the students, courses, and the complete class.  The students section will help us detect the performance drop of individual students.  We will consider that absences can be an explanatory factor in individual changes in  the assessment scores.  The course section will help us monitor scores, thereby aggregating the scores   of all the students at the same time. Drops in the scores of all the students at the   same time could mean that the cause is a particular subject in the course or the  teaching methodology.  The class section will allow us to monitor the average scores of the entire class,  thereby averaging scores in each course for all the students. Here, the number   of absences will be considered an important factor as well.  [ 216 ]   Creating the dashboard sections In this section, we will discuss each dashboard section separately, explaining what  information will be present in each section. We will also choose charts to represent  these pieces of information. Later, we will decide how to organize the sections in the  dashboard to make good use of the space and reflect the hierarchy of the information  presented in each area.  The students section The students section of the dashboard will display the students in a table, displaying  information about each student in rows. The most relevant information will be the  scores, but we will also include the absences from class, because this could be a  possible explanation of changes in performance.  The absences will be displayed using a barcode chart that is similar to the one  presented in Chapter 2, Reusable Charts. This version will be smaller and have a  background. This chart will help teachers know how many students didn't show   up in class and when, whether the absences are concentrated in a certain period,   or whether they are evenly distributed.  Absences for given students, displayed as a barcode chart  We will add a column for each course and display the scores of the students in  the course assignments as a line chart. The scales of the chart will be implicit; they  will always cover from 0 to 100 percent in the y axis and the current period in the  x axis. The background of the chart will highlight score ranges that are considered  important; the area below 25 percent has a different background, and the area  between 25 percent and 75 percent has a different background.  Scores of a student in different classes. The background of the chart highlights    areas of poor and high performance.  [ 217 ]   Finally, we will include the average score of the students in the current period. The  complete students section will gather all these elements.  Students section of the dashboard  The courses section Monitoring the performance of the courses is as important as monitoring the scores  of individual students. Small drops in the scores for a class could simply mean that  the concepts being taught are a little more difficult than usual, but an important  drop in the average score can have several causes that are worth investigating. For  instance, it could be interesting to know whether there are other courses with similar  behavior, as they could be interfering with each other due to difficult assignments on  the same dates, for instance.  The courses section of the dashboard will show the user the evolution of the scores  of each course and the average score of each course. To display the average score,  we will use bullet charts, which are a compact display that shows us how actual  measures compare with target values. Bullet charts are used to show us the value of  an indicator, adding backgrounds to give context to the indicator's value. In this case,  we will define regions of poor, regular, and good performance, and use the bullet  chart to know the average score of each class based on these regions. The following  figure illustrates a bullet chart:  [ 218 ]   Average scores of the students in each course  The class section In the class context, we need to know whether there are relevant changes in average  scores of the entire class. We will monitor weekly performance metrics so the  teachers can detect problems before they become too difficult to solve.  We will display the average score of the students in all the courses. The absences  for each week will also be included in the dashboard, so the user can quickly work  out whether scores and absences are related for a particular student. We will list the  date of the Monday of each week, displaying the average score for that week as a  bullet chart. We will also include the average score as a number and the number of  absences in the week as well.  Weekly average scores for all the courses and students in the class  [ 219 ]   Gathering the dashboard sections The last step is to gather all the sections in one screen. The final layout of the  dashboard will depend on the relative importance of the sections. In this case,  we will organize them from the most granular to the more general, giving more  space to the students section. The rationale behind this is that most of the time, the  performance problems will be at an individual level and less frequently at the level  of a course or class.  We will render each section inside a div element and assign it the section class.   We will add styles to help us differentiate the sections and make logical groups more  evident. We will add a light grey background and add a small border on top of each  section. We also added a small title to give it an additional context.  The completed dashboard. The sections are delimited with a light grey background.  In this example, the title of the dashboard is neither useful nor informative. In a  real-world dashboard, the area of the title would be a good place to add navigation  menus and links to other dashboard sections.  [ 220 ]   Summary  In this chapter, we described the characteristics of good dashboards and discussed  the process behind the design and implementation of dashboards. We learned good  practices to create effective dashboards. We also created an example dashboard to  monitor the performance of the students in a class, including sections to assess the  scores of individual students, courses, and classes.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to use GeoJSON and TopoJSON files to create  maps with D3. We will learn about projections, how to use maps to display data, and  how to integrate D3 with Mapbox.  [ 221 ]    Creating Maps  Maps are a 2D representation of the relevant features of places. Which features  are relevant will depend on the purpose of the map; a map for a zoo will show the  entrances, thematic areas, gift store, and where each animal is. In this case, there is  no need for the sizes and distances to be precise. In a geologic map, we will need  accurate distances and representations of the rock units and geologic strata.  Positions on the surface of the earth are described by two coordinates, longitude and  latitude. The longitude of a point is the angle between the point and the Greenwich  meridian, and the latitude is the angle between the point and the equator. The  latitude and longitude are the angles measured with respect to the equator and   the Greenwich meridian, as shown in the following diagram:   The longitude can take values between -180 and 180, while the latitude can have  values between 90  the North Pole  and -90  the South Pole .  Shapes on the earth can be described by listing the coordinates of the points in   their boundary in order. We can, for instance, describe an island by listing the  coordinates of points on the coastline separated by one kilometer in a clockwise  order. This representation won't be perfectly accurate, because it will not represent  the irregularities in the coastline that are smaller than one kilometer in size, but this  will be useful if we only need to have an idea of the shape of the island.  To create a map of a feature, we need to translate the coordinates that describe the  feature to points in a 2D surface. The functions that perform this translation are  called projections. As projections intend to represent a 3D surface in a 2D medium,  distortions will be introduced as follows:  The Mercator projection severely distorts the areas near the poles  [ 224 ]   Each projection has been created in order to minimize distortions of some kind. Some  projections will represent relative directions accurately but not the area of certain  regions; others will do the exact opposite. When using maps, it's important to know  what kinds of distortions are acceptable in each case.  In this chapter, we will learn how to create map-based charts with D3. We will learn  how to obtain, transform, and use geographic data in GeoJSON and TopoJSON  formats to create SVG-based maps. We will create a map to visualize the distortions  introduced by the Mercator projection, coloring each country by its area. Maps in  which regions are colored by a characteristic of the regions  population, income, and  so on  are called choropleths. In this section, we will implement a choropleth map  using D3 and GeoJSON. We will also learn how to use TopoJSON to create maps  with more compact geographic data files, and how to use TopoJSON to display  topologic information, such as the connection between features and boundaries.  Lastly, we will learn how to integrate D3 with Mapbox, an excellent map provider.  Obtaining geographic data  To create a map, we will need files that describe the coordinates of the features that  we intend to include in our map. One of the most reliable sources for medium-scale   geographic data is Natural Earth  http:  www.naturalearthdata.com , a  collaborative effort to curate and organize geographic datasets.  The geographic datasets available at Natural Earth are in the public domain and  are available at 1:10,000, 1:50,000, and 1:110,0000 scales. There are vector and raster  datasets, and the map files are classified in three categories:     Cultural: This contains countries, administrative divisions, states and   provinces, populated places, roads, urban areas, and parks     Physical: This describes coastlines, land, islands, oceans, rivers, lakes, and   glaciated areas among others     Raster: This contains images, depicting the relief as shades and with colors   based on climate  [ 225 ]   The files are in the ESRI shapefile format, the de facto standard for geographic  data. ESRIshape files represent the geometry of features as sets of points, lines, and  polygons. The files might also contain additional attributes about the features, such  as the name of the place, population in the last census, or the average income of the  population living in that area. A shapefile is a set of several files, which must include  the following three files:     .shp: Shape format, the geometry of the feature    .shx: An index to locate the features in the .shp file    .dbf: The feature attributes in the dBase IV format  The shapefile set can also contain optional files, such as the .prj file, which contains  information of the coordinate system and projection in which the vector data is stored.  Shapefiles are widely used in geographic information systems; however, the   format is not suited for its use in web platforms. We will transform the shapefiles   to JSON-based formats and use D3 to create maps from them.  Understanding the GeoJSON and TopoJSON  formats The most widely used formats to create maps with D3 are the GeoJSON and  TopoJSON formats. In this section, we will describe both the formats briefly   and learn how to transform ESRIshapefiles to GeoJSON or TopoJSON. The GeoJSON format encodes geometries, features, or collections of features using  the JSON format. We will describe the central aspects of the GeoJSON format; the  complete specification is available at http:  geojson.org .  A GeoJSON file always contains one top-level object. The GeoJSON object must have  a type attribute; for geometries, the type can be Point, MultiPoint, LineString,  MultiLineString, Polygon, or MultiPolygon. For a collection of geometries,  features, and collections of features, the type will be GeometryCollection, Feature,  or FeatureCollection, respectively. One GeoJSON file can contain a small island or  a collection of countries nested in the top-level object.  The GeoJSON objects that represent geometries must have a coordinates attribute,  whose contents will depend on the type of geometry. For a Point attribute, the  coordinates attribute will be an array of two elements, representing a position:  {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [10.0, 10.0]}  [ 226 ]   A LineString object represents a line, and its coordinates array contains a pair of  locations  the longitude and latitude of a place :  {   "type": "LineString",   "coordinates": [[10.0, 10.0], [10.0, 0.0]] }  A Polygon object is more complex. It's intended to represent a polygon that can  have holes on it. Polygons are represented by first describing the exterior boundary  and then the boundaries of the holes on it. A Polygon object with one hole could be  described with the following GeoJSON object:  {   "type": "Polygon",   "coordinates": [     [[0, 0], [0, 10], [10, 10], [0, 10], [10, 0]],     [[2, 2], [8, 2], [8, 8], [8, 2], [2, 2]]   ] }  Here, the exterior ring describes a square of size 10, and the hole on it is a  centered square of size 6. Also, there are geometries to describe the collections of  the mentioned geometries; a MultiPoint object will contain an array of points,  a MultiLineString object will contain an array with pairs of points, and a  MultiPolygon object will contain an array of polygons.  A Feature object must have a geometry attribute that will contain a geometry object,  usually Polygon or MultiPolygon. It may have a properties member that can be  used to store nongeographic data about the features, such as the name of the place,  population, or average income. For instance, the following feature object describes  the country of Aruba; it contains about a dozen properties, and the polygon contains  26 points:  {   "type": "Feature",   "properties": {     ...     "type": "Country",     "admin": "Aruba",     "adm0_a3": "ABW",     ...   },   "geometry": {     "type": "Polygon",  [ 227 ]       "coordinates": [       [         [-69.899121, 12.452001],         [-69.895703, 12.422998],         ...       ]     ]   } }  A FeatureCollection object will contain a features array, which will contain  feature objects.  As mentioned earlier, GeoJSON files describe features in terms of their geometry,  and in some cases, they are highly redundant. If two features share a boundary, the  common boundary coordinates will appear twice, once for each feature. Moreover,  the description of the boundary might not match exactly, generating artificial gaps  between the shapes. These shortcomings are addressed by the TopoJSON format  created by Mike Bostock, the creator of D3.  TopoJSON objects encode topologies instead of geometries, that is, describing the  relationship between points, lines, and shapes. In a TopoJSON object, shapes are  described as sequences of arcs, which are essentially boundary segments. Each  arc is defined once, but it can be referenced several times by the shapes that share  that arc. This removes redundancy, making TopoJSON lighter than their GeoJSON  counterparts. The coordinates in TopoJSON files are encoded in a more efficient way,  making TopoJSON even more compact.  The following TopoJSON object represents the country of Aruba. The object contains  an array of arcs, a transform attribute with information on how to decode the  coordinates of the arcs to longitude and latitude, and the objects member, which  contains the description of the features:  {   "type": "Topology",   "objects": {     "aruba": {       "type": "GeometryCollection",       "geometries": [         {  [ 228 ]             "type": "Polygon",           "arcs": [[0]]         }      ]     }   },   "arcs": [     [       [9798,   1517],       [  201, -1517],       [-2728,   812],       ...     ]   ],   "transform": {     "scale": [       0.000017042719896989698,       0.00001911323944894461     ],     "translate": [       -70.06611328125,        12.422998046874994     ]   } }  The objects member can contain one or more objects describing geometry, but  instead of listing the coordinates of the geometry object, the arcs array contains a  list of references to the arcs defined at the top level of the TopoJSON object. If several  features share a boundary, they will reference the same arc.  Besides the TopoJSON format, Mike Bostock created utilities to manipulate TopoJSON  and GeoJSON files. The TopoJSON program has two components: the command-line  program and the client-side library. The command-line program allows you to convert  shapefiles, CSV or GeoJSON formats, to TopoJSON. It has options to simplify the  features, combine several files in one output, and add or remove properties from the  original features. The JavaScript library allows you to parse the TopoJSON files and  construct Feature objects. The complete specification of the format and the programs is  available at https:  github.com mbostock topojson.  [ 229 ]   Transforming and manipulating the files We might need to manipulate the geographic data files in several ways. We might   want to reduce the level of detail of our features to have smaller files and simpler  features, include additional metadata not present in the original files, or even filter  some features.  To convert the files from one format to another, we will need to install the  Geospatial Data Abstraction Library  GDAL . GDAL provides command-line tools  to manipulate and convert geographic data between different formats, shapefiles and  GeoJSON among them. There are binaries available for Windows, Mac, and Linux  systems on their site, http:  www.gdal.org .  Depending on how we want our files, our workflow will include several steps that  we might need to redo later. It's a good idea to automate this process in a way that  allows us to understand why and how we transformed the files. One way to do this  is to use the make program or a similar system. We will use make to download and  transform the geographic datasets that we need for this chapter.  For the first chart, we will need to download the cultural vectors from Natural   Earth. In a world map, we don't need the most detailed level; we will download  medium-scale data. Then, we will uncompress the shapefiles and use the ogr2ogr  program to transform the shapefiles to GeoJSON.  We will implement these transformations using make. The Makefile is in the  chapter10 data directory of the code bundle. Each step can be done individually  in a terminal provided that it is performed in the correct order. In a Makefile,  we describe each step in the transformation process as a target, which can have  zero or more dependencies. To generate the target file from the dependencies, we  need to perform one or more commands. For instance, to generate the ne_50m_ admin_0_countries.shp target file, we need to uncompress the ne_50m_admin_0_ countries.zip file. This file is a dependency of the target file, because the target  can't be generated if the ZIP file doesn't exist. The command to generate the shapefile  is unzip ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip. The following Makefile will generate a  GeoJSON file that contains all the countries:   Variables ADMIN0_URL = http:  ... ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip   Targets   Download the Compressed Shapefiles ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip:  [ 230 ]       curl -LO $ ADMIN0_URL    Uncompress the Shapefiles ne_50m_admin_0_countries.shp: ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip     unzip ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip     touch ne_50m_admin_0_countries.shp   Convert the shapefiles to GeoJSON countries.geojson: ne_50m_admin_0_countries.shp     ogr2ogr -f GeoJSONcountries.geojso nne_50m_admin_0_countries.shp  The Makefiles manage the dependencies between targets; building the countries. geojson file will check the dependency chain and run the target commands in the  correct order. To generate the GeoJSON file in one step, run the following command:  $ make countries.geojson  It will download, uncompress, and transform the shapefiles to GeoJSON. It will  only perform the commands to generate the files that are not present in the current  directory; it won't download the ZIP file again if the file is already present.  We can use the GeoJSON file to create a TopoJSON version of the same file.   By default, topojson will strip all the properties of the original file. We can   preserve the properties by using the -p name option:  $ topojson -o countries.topojson -p admin –p continent     countries.geojson  Note that the file size of the GeoJSON file is about 4.4 M; the TopoJSON file is only  580 K. We will begin by using the countries.geojson file to create our first maps,  and then learn how to use the TopoJSON files to create maps. We will also include  this command in the Makefile to be able to replicate this conversion easily.  Creating maps with D3  In this section, we will create map-charts based on SVG. We will use the GeoJSON  file with the countries to create a choropleth map that shows the distortions  introduced by the Mercator projection.  We will also create maps using the more compact format, TopoJSON, and use  topologic information contained in the file to find the neighbors and specific   frontiers between countries.  [ 231 ]   Creating a choropleth map In this section, we will create a choropleth map to compare the areas of different  countries. We will paint each country according to its area; countries with greater  areas will be colored with darker colors. In general, the Mercator projection is not  suitable to create choropleth maps showing large areas, as this projection shows the  regions near the poles bigger than they really are. For instance, Antarctica is smaller  than Russia, but using the Mercator projection, it seems bigger. Brazil has a greater  area than Greenland, but with this projection, it looks smaller.  In this example, we will use the Mercator projection to show this effect. Our  choropleth map will allow us to compare the size of the countries. We will use the  GeoJSON file, chapter10 data countries.geojson, available in the code bundle.  The chapter10 01-countries-geojson.html file displays the contents of the file  for a more convenient inspection of the features and their attributes.  We will begin by reading the contents of the GeoJSON file and creating the SVG  element to display the map. GeoJSON is encoded in the JSON format, so we can   use the d3.json method to retrieve and parse the content from GeoJSON:  d3.json geoJsonUrl, function error, data  {         Handle errors getting or parsing the GeoJSON file     if  error  { return error; }         Create the SVG container selection     var div = d3.select 'map01' ,         svg = div.selectAll 'svg' .data [data] ;         Create the SVG element on enter     svg.enter  .append 'svg'          .attr 'width', width          .attr 'height', height ; } ;  The data variable contains the GeoJSON object. In this case, the GeoJSON object  contains a FeatureCollection object, and the features array contains Feature  objects, one for each country.  [ 232 ]   To map the feature coordinates, we will need a projection function. D3 includes  about a dozen of the most used projections, and there are even more available as  plugins  see https:  github.com d3 d3-geo-projection for the complete list .  We will create an instance of the Mercator projection and translate it so that the   point with the coordinates [0, 0] lies in the center of the SVG figure:     Create an instance of the Mercator projection var projection = d3.geo.mercator       .translate [width   2, height   2] ;  With this function, we can compute the SVG coordinates of any point on earth.   For instance, we can compute the SVG coordinates of a point in the coast of Aruba   by invoking the projection function with the [longitude, latitude] array as   an argument:  projection [-69.899121, 12.452001]     [17.004529145013294, 167.1410458329102]  We have the geometric description of each feature; the geometries contain arrays of  coordinates. We could use these arrays to compute the projection of each point and  draw the shapes using the d3.svg.path generator, but this will involve interpreting  the geometries of the features. Fortunately, D3 includes a geographic path generator  that does the work for us:     Create the path generator and configure its projection var pathGenerator = d3.geo.path       .projection projection ;  The d3.geo.path generator needs the projection to compute the paths. Now, we can  create the path objects that will represent our features:     Create a selection for the countries var features = svg.selectAll 'path.feature'      .data data.features ;     Append the paths on enter features.enter  .append 'path'      .attr 'class', 'feature' ;     Set the path of the countries features.attr 'd', pathGenerator ;  [ 233 ]   We have added the class feature to each path in order to configure its style using  CSS. After including the chapter10 map.css style sheet file, our map will look  similar what is shown in to the following figure:  A map of the world countries, using the Mercator projection with the default scale  We can see that the features are correctly drawn, but we would like to add colors  for the ocean and scale the map to show all the countries. Projections have a scale  method that allows you to set the projection's scale. Note that different projections  interpret the scale in different ways. In the case of the Mercator projection, we can  map the entire world by setting the scale as the ratio between the figure width and  the complete angle, in radians:     The width will cover the complete circumference var scale = width    2 * Math.PI ;     Create and center the projection var projection = d3.geo.mercator       .scale scale      .translate [width   2, height   2] ;  [ 234 ]   We will also want to add a background to represent the oceans. We could simply  add a SVG rectangle before inserting the features; instead, we will create a feature  object that spans the globe and uses the path generator to create an SVG path. This is  a better approach because if we change the projection later, the background will still  cover the complete globe. Note that we need to close the polygon by adding the first  point in the last position:  var globeFeature = {     type: 'Feature',     geometry: {         type: 'Polygon',         coordinates: [             [                 [-179.999, 89.999],                 [ 179.999, 89.999],                 [ 179.999, -89.999],                 [-179.999, -89.999],                 [-179.999, 89.999]             ]         ]     } };     Create a selection for the globe var globe = svg.selectAll 'path.globe'      .data [globeFeature] ;     Append the graticule paths on enter globe.enter  .append 'path'      .attr 'class', 'globe' ;  To avoid overlapping, the rectangle defined by the coordinates doesn't completely  cover the globe. We can now create the path for the globe and add a style to it,   as we did for the rest of the features:     Set the path data using the path generator globe.attr 'd', pathGenerator ;  We will also add reference lines for the meridians and parallels. These lines are  called as graticules, and D3 includes a generator that returns a MultiLineString  object with the description of the lines:     Create the graticule feature generator var graticule = d3.geo.graticule  ;     Create a selection for the graticule  [ 235 ]   var grid = svg.selectAll 'path.graticule'      .data [graticule  ]      Append the graticule paths on enter grid.enter  .append 'path'      .attr 'class', 'graticule' ;     Set the path attribute for the graticule grid.attr 'd', pathGenerator ;  We have also added a class to the graticule lines to apply styles using CSS. The map  now looks better:  The map with the oceans and the graticule  [ 236 ]   When creating a choropleth map, one of the most important choices to be made is the  color scale to be used. Color Brewer  http:  colorbrewer2.org   is an online tool  that helps developers and designers to choose good color scales for their maps. There  are color scales for qualitative dimensions as well as for sequential and diverging  quantitative dimensions. The colors of each palette have been carefully chosen so  that there is a good contrast between the colors and they look good on the screen.  For a map that shows a qualitative dimension, the color scale should be composed   of colors that differ primarily in hue but have a similar brightness and saturation.   An example of this could be a map showing which languages are spoken in each  country, as shown in the following figure:  A qualitative color scale doesn't suggest order between the items  For quantitative variables that are sequential, that is, ranging from less to more in  one dimension, a color scale with increasing darkness will be a good choice. For  instance, to display differences in income or housing costs, a sequential scale would  be a good fit, as shown in the following figure:  A sequential color scale is a good choice for ordinal variables  For a quantitative variable that covers two extremes, the color palette should  emphasize the extremes with dark colors of different hue and show the critical   mid-range values with lighter colors. An example of this could be a map that shows  the average winter temperatures, showing the countries with temperatures below  zero in blue, temperatures above zero in red, and the zero value in white, as shown   in the following figure:  A diverging color scale is useful to show variables that cover extremes  [ 237 ]   In our case, we will use a sequential scale because our quantitative variable is the  area of each country. Countries with a bigger surface will be shown in a darker color.  We will use Color Brewer to generate a sequential palette:  var colorRange = [     'f7fcfd',     'e0ecf4',     'bfd3e6',     '9ebcda',     '8c96c6',     '8c6bb1',     '88419d',     '6e016b'];  This color palette has eight levels, ranging from almost white to dark purple.   The d3.geo.area method computes the area of a feature in steradians, which is   the measurement unit for solid angles. We will use the d3.scale.quantize scale   to assign the area of each feature to one of the colors of our palette:     Create the color scale for the area of the features var colorScale = d3.scale.quantize       .domain d3.extent data.features, d3.geo.area       .range colorRange ;  We use the d3.geo.area method to compute the area of each feature and to compute  the fill color using the color scale:     Set the path of the countries features.attr 'd', pathGenerator      .attr 'fill', function d  {         return colorScale d3.geo.area d  ;     } ;  We obtain a map with each country colored according to its area, as shown in the  following figure:  [ 238 ]   The choropleth that shows the area of each country  When we take a look at the choropleth, we can see several inconsistencies between  the size and the colors. Greenland, for instance, looks twice as big as Brazil, but it's  actually smaller than Brazil, Australia, and the United States.  Mapping topology As mentioned in the previous section, TopoJSON files are more compact than their  GeoJSON counterparts, but the real power of TopoJSON is that it encodes topology,  that is, information about connectedness and the boundaries of the geometries it  describes. Topology gives us access to more information than just the shapes of   each feature; we can identify the neighbors and boundaries between geometries.  [ 239 ]   In this section, we will use the countries.topojson file to create a world map,  replacing GeoJSON from the previous section. We will also identify and map  the neighboring countries of Bolivia and identify a particular frontier using  the TopoJSON library. As we did in the previous section, we have created the  chapter10 03-countries-topojson.html file to display the contents of the  TopoJSON file for easier inspection.  To create a world map with TopoJSON, we need to create the SVG container and the  projection in the same way that we did with the GeoJSON file. The geographic path  generator expects GeoJSON objects, but at this point, we have a TopoJSON object  that encodes the geometry of our features. The topojson.feature object computes  the GeoJSON Feature or FeatureCollection object, corresponding to the object  given as the second argument. Remember that the object attribute contains the  TopoJSON geometry objects, which have an array of references to the arcs defined  at the top level of the TopoJSON object. In this case, the geodata variable stores a  FeatureCollection object, which we can use to generate the shapes using the same  code as that used earlier:  d3.json url, function error, data  {         Create the SVG container...         Construct the Feature Collection     var geodata = topojson.feature data,data.objects.countries ;         Render the features } ;  The geodata object is a FeatureCollection object, and we can use the same  projection and path generator that we used in the last section to generate the   world map:     Create a selection for the countries and bind the feature data var features = svg.selectAll 'path.feature'      .data geodata.features      .enter       .append 'path'      .attr 'class', 'feature'      .attr 'd', pathGenerator ;  [ 240 ]   This allows us to replace the GeoJSON file that we used in the previous section with  the TopoJSON file, which is about one-eight the size of the countries.geojson file  and obtains the same result, as shown in the following figure:  The world map using TopoJSON  As TopoJSON files describe geometries by listing references to the arcs, we can verify  that two geometries are neighbors by checking whether they have arcs in common.  The topojson.neighbors method does exactly this, given an array of geometries; it  returns an array with the indices of the neighbors of each geometry object.  [ 241 ]   To illustrate this point, we will create a map that highlights the countries that share  a boundary with Bolivia. We will begin by scaling and centering the map to display  South America. We begin by filtering the countries that belong to South America and  creating a FeatureCollection object for them:     Construct the FeatureCollection object var geodata = topojson.feature data, data.objects.countries ;     Filter the countries in South America var southAmerica = geodata.features.filter function d  {         return  d.properties.continent === 'South America' ;     } ;     Create a feature collection for South America var southAmericaFeature = {         type: 'FeatureCollection',         features: southAmerica     };  We would like to adapt the scale and translation of the projection to just display  South America. D3 provides tools to compute the bounding box and centroid   of a feature:     Compute the bounds, centroid, and extent of South America    to configure the projection var bounds = d3.geo.bounds southAmericaFeature ,     center = d3.geo.centroid southAmericaFeature ;  The d3.geo.bounds method returns the bottom-left and top-right corners of the  feature's bounding box in geographic coordinates. The d3.geo.centroid method  returns an array with the longitude and latitude of the centroid of the feature.  To compute a scale factor that displays our feature object properly, we need to  know the angular distance between the two corners of our bounding box. We could  also use another characteristic distance of the feature, such as the distance from the  centroid to one of the bounding box corners:     Compute the angular distance between bound corners var distance = d3.geo.distance bounds[0], bounds[1] ;  [ 242 ]   The d3.geo.distance method takes two locations and returns the angular distance  between the points  in radians . For the Mercator projection, we can compute the  scale as the ratio between the desired screen size and the angular span of our feature.  We can recompute the scale with the angular distance between the corners of the  bounding box:     The width will cover the complete circumference var scale = width   distance;  We can now center and scale our projection. This will show our feature centered in  the screen and at a better scale:     Create and scale the projection var projection = d3.geo.mercator       .scale scale      .translate [width   2, height   2]      .center center ;  Note that this way of computing the scale will only work with the Mercator  projection. The scales are not consistent among projections, as shown in the   following figure:  Centering and scaling a map around a feature  [ 243 ]   Having centered and scaled the South American continent properly, we can proceed  to compute the neighbors of Bolivia. We begin by obtaining the neighbors of each  country in our dataset:     Compute the neighbors of each geometry object. var neighbors =     topojson.neighbors data.objects.countries.geometries ;  This will return an array with as many elements as the input array. Each element will  be an array with the indices of the neighbor geometries of each object. The geometry  of Bolivia is described by the thirtieth element in the data.objects.countries. geometries array. The contents of neighbors[30] is the [8, 31, 39, 169, 177]  array; each element is the index of the geometry element of each neighboring country.  To find Bolivia's neighbors, we need to know the index of Bolivia, so, we will search  for it in the geometries array:     Find the index of Bolivia in the geometries array var countryIndex = 0; data.objects.countries.geometries.forEach function d, i  {     if  d.properties.admin === 'Bolivia'  {         countryIndex = i;     } } ;  The neighbors[countryIndex] array will contain the indices of the neighbors of  Bolivia. To display the neighbor's features in the map, we need to compute a feature  that contains their geometries. We can create a GeometryCollection object in order  to use the topojson.feature method to construct the FeatureCollection object  with the neighbors:     Construct a Geometry Collection with the neighbors var geomCollection = {     type: 'GeometryCollection',     geometries: [] };     Add the neighbor's geometry object to the geometry collection neighbors[countryIndex].forEach function i  {     var geom = data.objects.countries.geometries[i];     geomCollection.geometries.push geom ; } ;  [ 244 ]   The geometry collection object we just created contains the geometries of the  countries that share boundaries with Bolivia. We will create a feature collection  object for these geometries in order to add them to the map:     Construct a Feature object for the neighbors var neighborFeature = topojson.feature data, geomCollection ;  We can now create the path for the feature containing the neighbors, and add a class  to the path to set its style with CSS:     Add paths for the neighbor countries var neighborPaths = svg.selectAll 'path.neighbor'      .data [neighborFeature]      .enter       .append 'path'      .attr 'class', 'neighbor'      .attr 'd', pathGenerator ;  The countries that share a boundary with Bolivia are highlighted in the  following figure:  [ 245 ]   The TopoJSON file gives us more information. Let's say that we need to show  the frontier between Bolivia and Brazil. We know that this frontier is identifiable,  because we could inspect the geometries for both countries and select the arcs that  are common to both geometries, but there is an easier way. The topojson.mesh  method returns a GeoJSON MultiLineString geometry that represents the mesh  for a given object and geometry. It has an optional argument to filter the arcs that  meet a condition. We will use this method to generate a MultiLineString object,  representing the boundary between Brazil and Bolivia:     Compute the mesh of the boundary between Brazil and Bolivia var frontier = topojson.mesh data, data.objects.countries, function a,  b  {     return   a.properties.admin === 'Brazil'  &&  b.properties.admin  === 'Bolivia'                 a.properties.admin === 'Bolivia'  &&  b.properties.admin  === 'Brazil'  ; } ;  Note that the optional filter receives two TopoJSON geometries, not GeoJSON  features. To obtain the frontier between Brazil and Bolivia, we need to select the arcs  that are shared by both the countries. We can now create a path for the frontier and  add it to our map:     Add the frontier to the SVG element var frontierPath = svg.selectAll 'path.frontier'      .data [frontier]      .enter       .append 'path'      .attr 'class', 'frontier'      .attr 'd', pathGenerator ;  [ 246 ]   The boundary between the two countries is highlighted in the following updated map:  Note that the topojson.mesh method can be used to identify frontiers of any kind.  In other datasets, this can be useful to show or hide internal frontiers or frontiers  with countries that meet certain conditions.  [ 247 ]   In this section, we learned how to use GeoJSON to create SVG-based maps. We have  also learned how to use TopoJSON files to reconstruct GeoJSON objects and create  a map. We've also learned how to create maps that highlight topologic relations  between places, such as highlighting countries that are connected to each other   and show specific boundaries between features.  Using Mapbox and D3 SVG-based maps are great for data visualization projects, but sometimes, we will  need more advanced features in our maps, such as a feature that allows us to search  for an address or location, get information at the street level, or show satellite images.  The most convenient way to provide these features is to integrate our visualization  with map providers such as Google Maps, Yahoo! Maps, or Mapbox. In this section,  we will learn how to integrate D3 with Mapbox, an excellent map provider.  Mapbox is an online platform used to create custom-designed maps for web and  mobile applications. It provides street maps and terrain and satellite view tiles. The  street maps from Mapbox use data from OpenStreetMap, a community-powered  open data repository with frequent updates and accurate information.  A distinctive feature of Mapbox is that it allows customization of the map views.  Users can customize the visual aspects of every feature in their maps. The web  platform has tools to customize the maps, and the desktop tool, TileMill, makes this  customization even easier.  To follow the examples in this section, you will need a Mapbox account. The free  plan allows you to create maps, add markers and features, and get up to 3,000 views  per month. To create a Mapbox account, visit https:  www.mapbox.com.  Mapbox counts the views to your map, and each plan has a limit on  the number of views per month. If you create a visualization using  Mapbox and it becomes popular  I hope so! , you might want to  upgrade your account. In any case, you will be notified if you are  about to spend your monthly quota.  The Mapbox JavaScript API is implemented as a Leaflet plugin and includes a   release of Leaflet, an open source library to create interactive map applications.  Leaflet provides an API that allows you to create layers, interactive elements    such as zooming and panning , add custom markets, and many others. We will   use the Mapbox and Leaflet APIs to create maps and integrate the maps with D3.  [ 248 ]   Creating a Mapbox project We will begin by pointing the browser to https:  www.mapbox.com projects  and  create a new project. In Mapbox, a project is a map that we can customize according  to our needs. By clicking on Create a Project, we can access the map editor, where  we can customize the colors of land, buildings, and other features; select the base  layer  street, terrain, or satellite ; and select the primary language for the features  and locations in the map. We can also add markers and polygons and export them to  KML or GeoJSON in order to use them in other projects. You can also set the map as  private or public, remove geocoding, or remove sharing buttons.  Once we save the map, it will be given a map ID. This ID is necessary to load the  map using the JavaScript API, view the tiles, or embed the map in a page. The ID is  composed of the username and a map handle. To use the JavaScript API, we need  to include the Mapbox.js library and styles. These files can also be downloaded and  installed locally with Bower  bower install --save-devmapbox.js :  <script src='https:  api.tiles.mapbox.com mapbox.js     v1.6.2 mapbox.js'>  <link href='https:  api.tiles.mapbox.com mapbox.js     v1.6.2 mapbox.css'rel='stylesheet'  >  To include the map in our page, we need to create a container div and set its position  to absolute. We will also create a container for this div element in order to give the  map container a positioning context:  The top and left offsets of the map container will be governed by the parent element.  For this example, we will add the styles at the top of our page:              .map-container {     position: relative;     width: 600px;     height: 400px; }  map {     position: absolute;     top: 0;     bottom: 0;     width: 100%; }    [ 249 ]   The next step is to create an instance of the map. We can set the view's center and  zoom level by chaining the setView method:    var mapID = 'username.xxxxxxxx',    replace with your map ID     center = [12.526, -69.997],     zoomLevel = 11;  var map = L.mapbox.map 'map', mapID      .setView center, zoomLevel ;    The map of Aruba created by Mapbox is shown in the following figure:  The map will be rendered in the container div. Note that the maps support all the  interactions that we expect; we can zoom in or out and drag the map to explore the  surrounding areas.  [ 250 ]   Integrating Mapbox and D3 In this example, we will create a bubble plot map to show the population of the   main cities in Aruba. We have created a JSON file with the necessary information.  The JSON file has the following structure:  {   "country": "Aruba",   "description": "Population of the main cities in Aruba",   "cities": [     {       "name": "Oranjestad",       "population": 28294,       "coordinates": [12.519, -70.037]     },     ...   ] }  To create the bubbles, we will create a layer. Layers are objects attached to a  particular location, such as markers or tiles. Most Leaflet objects are created by  extending the L.Class object, which implements simple classical inheritance and  several utility methods. We will create a D3 layer class by extending the L.Class  object. Layers must at least have an initialize and the onAdd methods. We will also  include the onRemove method to remove the bubbles if the layer is removed. A basic  layer will have the following structure:  var D3Layer = L.Class.extend {      initialize: function arguments...  {            Initialization code     },      onAdd: function map  {            Create and update the bubbles     },      onRemove: function map  {            Clean the map     } } ;  [ 251 ]   The initialize method will be invoked when the layer instance is created. The  onAdd method is invoked when the layer is added to the map. It receives the map  object as an argument, which gives us access to the panes, zoom level, and other  properties of the map. The onRemove method is invoked when the layer is removed  from the map, and it also receives the map as an argument.  Whenever the user interacts with the map by dragging or zooming, the map triggers  the viewreset event. This method notifies that the layers need to be repositioned.  The latLngToLayerPoint method can be used to set the new position of the objects,  given their geographic coordinates.  In our case, the initialize method will receive a single data argument, which will  contain the array with the cities of Aruba. We will store the data array as an attribute  of the layer:      initialize: function data  {         this._data = data;     },  The data array will be accessible from each method of the layer. In the onAdd  method, we will select a pane from the map and append the bubbles to it. The  container div for our bubbles will be the overlay pane of the map, which is a pane  designed to contain custom objects. The overlay pane gets repositioned automatically  each time the user pans the map.  One strategy is to create a single svg container to hold our bubbles and to resize it  each time the user zooms in or out. Another strategy we will use is to create one  svg element for each bubble and position it absolutely using the projection of the  coordinates of each feature. We will create a selection for the svg elements and bind  the data to the selection:      onAdd: function map  {             Create SVG elements under the overlay pane         var div = d3.select map.getPanes  .overlayPane ,             svg = div.selectAll 'svg.point' .data this._data ;             Create the bubbles...     },  To position the SVG elements, we need to project the latitude and longitude of each  point and use these coordinates to set the offsets of our svg containers. We will add  the L.LatLng objects with the coordinates of each city to each data item:             Stores the latitude and longitude of each city         this._data.forEach function d  {  [ 252 ]               d.LatLng = new L.LatLng d.coordinates[0],  d.coordinates[1] ;         } ;  We will use this attribute in just a few moments. The svg elements will be created to  contain just one bubble, so they don't overlap other areas of the map. Before setting  the size of the svg elements, we need to compute the radius scale. The area of the  bubbles should be proportional to the population of the city:             Create a scale for the population         var rScale = d3.scale.sqrt               .domain [0, d3.max this._data, function d  {                 return d.population;             } ]              .range [0, 35] ;  We can now create the svg elements and set their size and position. Note that the svg  element's width and height are twice as big as the radius of the bubble:          svg.enter  .append 'svg'              .attr 'width', function d  {                 return 2 * rScale d.population ;             }              .attr 'height', function d  {                 return 2 * rScale d.population ;             }              .attr 'class', 'point leaflet-zoom-hide'              .style 'position', 'absolute' ;  We have added the leaflet-zoom-hide class to each svg element so that they are  hidden when the map is being zoomed in or out by the user. We also set the position  of the svg container to absolute. We can finally add the bubbles as usual, appending  a circle to each svg container:          svg.append 'circle'              .attr 'cx', function d  { return rScale d.population ; }              .attr 'cy', function d  { return rScale d.population ; }              .attr 'r', function d  { return rScale d.population ; }              .attr 'class', 'city'              .on 'mouseover', function d  {                 d3.select this .classed 'highlight', true ;             }              .on 'mouseout', function d  {                 d3.select this .classed 'highlight', false ;             } ;  [ 253 ]   We added event listeners for the mouseover and mouseout events. In these events, we  add the highlight class to the circles, which will increase the opacity of the circles.  When the user drags the map, the overlay pane will be moved as well and the  bubbles will be well positioned. When the user zooms in out of the map, the  viewreset event will be triggered, and we must reposition the svg containers.   We will create an updateBubbles function to update the position of the bubbles   on zoom, and invoke this function on viewreset:             Update the position of the bubbles on zoom         map.on 'viewreset', updateBubbles ;  When the callback of the viewreset event is invoked, the map.latLngToLayerPoint  projection method is updated with the new zoom level and position. So, we can use  it to set the offsets of the svg elements:          function updateBubbles   {             svg                 .style 'left', function d  {                     var dx = map.latLngToLayerPoint d.LatLng .x;                     return  dx - rScale d.population   + 'px';               }                  .style 'top', function d  {                     var dy = map.latLngToLayerPoint d.LatLng .y;                     return  dy - rScale d.population   + 'px';                 } ;         }  Finally, we invoke the updateBubbles method to render the bubbles:             Render the bubbles on add         updateBubbles  ;  The onRemove method is simpler; we just select the overlay pane and remove all the  svg elements from it:      onRemove: function map  {         var div = d3.select map.getPanes  .overlayPane ;         div.selectAll 'svg.point' .remove  ;     }  [ 254 ]   Having created our layer, we can retrieve the JSON file and append it to the map:     Retrieve the dataset of cities of Aruba d3.json ' chapter10 data aruba-cities.json', function error, data  {         Handle errors getting or parsing the data     if  error  { return error; }         Create a layer with the cities data     map.addLayer new D3Layer data.cities  ; } ;  Our following map shows the bubbles that represent the population of the cities   of Aruba:  A bubble plot map with D3 and Mapbox  [ 255 ]   Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to obtain and transform geographic datasets using  open source tools. We learned how to use and interpret two popular formats for  mapping information for the Web, GeoJSON, and TopoJSON.  We also learned how to create simple charts based on SVG, rendering the geographic  features as svg paths. We created a choropleth map using the Mercator projection  and used TopoJSON to obtain information about topology, allowing us to identify  neighbors and frontiers between countries.  Finally, we learned how to use Mapbox and D3 to create data visualizations for  applications that require street-level detail.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to use other projections to create 3D-like views  of our maps and how to project raster images in our maps.  [ 256 ]   Creating Advanced Maps  In the last chapter, we learned how to use the GeoJSON and TopoJSON formats  to create map-based charts using SVG. In this chapter, we will explore different  cartographic projections and learn how to use the Orthographic and Stereographic  projections to create 3D-like renderings of our maps.  We will add interaction to our maps by adding drag and zoom behavior, allowing  the user to rotate and zoom the map views. We will use the Orthographic projection  to create a rotating view of the Earth, and we will create a star map using the  Orthographic projection.  We will also learn how to project raster images of the Earth using canvas and D3  projections in order to have realistic renderings of it.  Using cartographic projections  As we mentioned in the previous chapter, cartographic projections are functions  that map positions on the Earth to points on a flat surface. The d3.geo module of D3  implements about a dozen of the most used cartographic projections, and there are  even more cartographic projections available in the extended geographic projections  plugin at https:  github.com d3 d3-geo-projection .  There are a great number of projections because none of them are appropriate for  every application. The Mercator projection, for instance, was created as a navigation  tool. Straight lines on the Mercator projection are rhumb lines, which are lines of  constant compass bearing. This projection is very useful for navigation, but the areas  near the poles are extremely distorted. The poles, which are points on the surface of  the Earth, are represented as lines that are as long as the equator. The Orthographic  projection, on the other hand, is closer to what we would see from space, creating  a more accurate mental image of how the Earth really is, but it's probably not very  useful to navigate by sea.   In this section, we will learn how to use more projections and discuss some of their  properties. The examples in this section are in the chapter11 01-projections file  in the code bundle. For the examples in this section, we will use a TopoJSON file  that contains land features, which are generated from the medium-scale shapefiles  from Natural Earth. The Makefile in the chapter11 data folder will download and  transform the necessary files for us.  Using the Equirectangular projection The Equirectangular projection linearly maps longitude to a horizontal position and  latitude to a vertical position using the same scale. As there are 180 degrees from  pole to pole, and the circumference of the earth covers 360 degrees, the width of a  world map created with this projection will be twice its height. It's mathematical  simplicity is about its only useful property.  To create a world map, we begin by loading the TopoJSON file and using the  topojson.feature method to compute the GeoJSON object, representing the   shapes described in the ne_50m_land object:  d3.json ' chapter11 data land.json', function error, data  {         Notifies about errors getting or parsing the data     if  error  { console.error error ; }         Construct the GeoJSON features     var geojson = topojson.feature data,         data.objects.ne_50m_land ;         Create the projection and draw the features... } ;  As usual, we set the width and height of the svg container of the map. We select the  container div for the map and append the svg element, setting its width and height:         Set the width and height of the svg element     var width = 600,          height = 300;         Append the svg container and set its size     var div = d3.select 'map-equirectangular' ,         svg = div.append 'svg'              .attr 'width', width              .attr 'height', height ;  [ 258 ]   We create an instance of the d3.geo.equirectangular projection and configure its  scale and translation by chaining the corresponding methods. Note that scales are  not consistent among projections. In this case, in order to show the world map, we  can set the scale either to height   Math.PI or width    2 * Math.PI . In both  cases, the result will be the same:         Create an instance of the Equirectangular projection     var equirectangular = d3.geo.equirectangular           .scale width    2 * Math.PI           .translate [width   2, height   2] ;  Once we have the projection created, we can create an instance of the geographic  path generator and set its projection attribute:         Create and configure the geographic path generator     var path = d3.geo.path           .projection equirectangular ;  The path generator receives a GeoJSON feature or feature collection and uses the  projection to compute the corresponding svg path string. Finally, we append a path  element to the svg container, bind the feature collection to the selection, and set the  path data string to be computed with the path generator:         Append the path of the features to the svg container     svg.append 'path' .datum geojson          .attr 'class', 'land'          .attr 'd', path ;  We will also add parallels and meridians to the figure. D3 has a generator that  creates these lines. The d3.geo.graticule   method returns a configurable   function that creates a feature collection that contains the graticule lines:         Create the graticule lines     var graticule = d3.geo.graticule  ;         Add the graticule to the figure     svg.append 'path' .datum graticule            .attr 'class', 'graticule'          .attr 'd', path ;  [ 259 ]   A world map created with the Equirectangular projection is shown in the   following screenshot:  The Conic Equidistant projection The Conic Equidistant projection maps the sphere into a cone whose axis coincides  with the axis of the Earth. The cone can be tangent to the sphere in one parallel or  secant in two parallels, which are called standard parallels. In this projection, the  poles are represented with arcs, and the local shapes are true among the standard  parallels. In the Conic Equidistant projection, the distances among meridians are  proportionally correct. They are better suited to represent regions that have a small  range of latitude, such as regional maps or small countries.  The process to generate a world map with this projection is the same as the previous  process, except that this time, we need to create and configure an instance of the  d3.geo.conicEquidistant projection. For this projection, computing the exact   scale will be more difficult, but it's easy to adjust it until it has the correct size:         Create and configure an instance of the projection     var conic = d3.geo.conicEquidistant           .scale 0.75 * width    2 * Math.PI           .translate [width   2, height   2] ;  [ 260 ]   The world map created with the Conic Equidistant projection is shown in the  following screenshot:  As we mentioned earlier, this projection is not appropriate to display the world map,  but it can represent small areas accurately. We can rotate the projection to center it  around New Zealand and set a bigger scale. We set the standard parallels to 5 degrees  north and 15 degrees south. This will minimize the distortion among these parallels:         Create and configure an instance of the projection     var conic = d3.geo.conicEquidistant           .scale 0.85 * width    Math.PI   3           .rotate [-141, 0]          .translate [width   2, height   2]          .parallels [5, -15] ;  The map of New Zealand using the Conic Equidistant projection is shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 261 ]   The Orthographic projection The Orthographic projection is a perspective projection that shows the Earth as  seen from space. This gives us the illusion of a three-dimensional view. Only one  hemisphere can be seen at a time without overlapping. This has minimal distortion  near the center and huge distortion towards the horizon.  To use this projection, we need to set the scale and translation of the projection and  use it to configure the path generator:         Create an instance of the Orthographic projection     var orthographic = d3.geo.orthographic           .scale height   2          .translate [width   2, height   2] ;  An orthographic view of the Earth is shown in the following screenshot:  To avoid overlapping, we would need to display only the features that are on   the same side as the observer. To do this, we need to clip the projection to hide the  features that are at the other side of the Earth. The clipAngle method allows us to  clip the features beyond the clipping angle. Setting this angle to 90 will modify the  geometry of the features whose angular distance is greater than 90 from the center   of the projection; so, they are not shown in the image:         Create an instance of the Orthographic projection     var orthographic = d3.geo.orthographic           .scale height   2          .translate [width   2, height   2]          .clipAngle 90 ;  [ 262 ]   The following screenshot shows us Earth from the side of the observer:  An Orthographic view of Earth with clipping  The projections shown in this section are only a small sample of the projections  available in the geographic module of D3. As we can see, the pattern of use of  different projections is always the same, but the parameters of each projection   should be adjusted to get the desired result. In the next section, we will learn   how to use the drag behavior to rotate the globe.  Creating a rotating globe  The Orthographic projection displays the Earth like a 3D object, but it only shows   us one side at a time, and only the center is shown accurately. In this section, we will  use this projection and the zoom behavior to allow the user to explore the features by  rotating and zooming in on the globe.  The code of this example is available in the chapter11 02-rotating file of the code  bundle. We will begin by drawing a globe using the Orthographic projection. As we  did in the previous section, we load the TopoJSON data and construct the GeoJSON  feature collection that represents the ne_50m_land object:  d3.json ' chapter11 data land.json', function error, data  {         Handle errors getting or parsing the data  [ 263 ]       if  error  { console.error error ; }         Construct the GeoJSON feature collection using TopoJSON     var geojson = topojson.feature data,         data.objects.ne_50m_land ;         Create the svg container... } ;  We set the width and height of the svg element and use these dimensions to   create and configure an instance of the Orthographic projection. We also select   the container div and append the svg container to the map:         Width and height of the svg element     var width = 600,          height = 300;         Create an instance of the Orthographic projection     var orthographic = d3.geo.orthographic           .scale height   2          .translate [width   2, height   2]          .clipAngle 90 ;         Append the svg container and set its size     var div = d3.select 'map-orthographic' ,         svg = div.append 'svg'              .attr 'width', width              .attr 'height', height ;  We create an instance of the geographic path generator and set its projection to be  the Orthographic projection instance:         Create and configure the geographic path generator     var path = d3.geo.path           .projection orthographic ;  We will add features to represent the globe, the land, and lines for the parallels  and meridians. We will add a feature to represent the globe in order to have a  background for the features. The path generator supports an object of the Sphere  type. An object of this type doesn't have coordinates, since it represents the complete  globe. We will also append the GeoJSON object that contains the land features:         Globe     var globe = svg.append 'path' .datum {type: 'Sphere'}          .attr 'class', 'globe'   [ 264 ]           .attr 'd', path ;         Features     var land = svg.append 'path' .datum geojson          .attr 'class', 'land'          .attr 'd', path ;  We will also add the graticule, which is a set of parallels and meridian lines, in order  to give us a more accurate reference for the orientation and rotation of the sphere:         Create the graticule generator     var graticule = d3.geo.graticule  ;         Append the parallel and meridian lines     var lines = svg.append 'path' .datum graticule            .attr 'class', 'graticule'          .attr 'd', path ;  The preceding code will show us the Earth with the same aspect as the previous  section. The strategy to add rotation and zoom to the globe will be to add an invisible  overlay over the globe and add listeners for the pan and zoom gestures using the  zoom behavior. The callback for the zoom event will update the projection rotation  and scale and update the paths of the features using the path generator configured  earlier. To keep the state of the zoom behavior and the projection in sync, we will  store the current rotation angles and the scale of the projection in the state variable:         Store the rotation and scale of the projection     var state = {x: 0, y: -45, scale: height   2};  We will update the configuration of the projection to use the attributes of this  variable, just for consistency:         Create and configure the Orthographic projection     var orthographic = d3.geo.orthographic           .scale state.scale          .translate [width   2, height   2]          .clipAngle 90          .rotate [state.x, state.y] ;  The zoom and pan should be triggered only when the user performs these gestures  over the globe, not outside. We will create an overlay circle of the same size as the  globe and set its fill-opacity attribute to zero. We will bind the state variable to  the overlay in order to modify it in the zoom callback:         Append the overlay and set its attributes     var overlay = svg.append 'circle' .datum state   [ 265 ]           .attr 'r', height   2          .attr 'transform', function   {             return 'translate ' + [width   2, height   2] + ' ';         }          .attr 'fill-opacity', 0 ;  We need to create an instance of the zoom behavior and bind it to the overlay. This  will add event listeners for the pan and zoom gestures to the overlay. We will limit  the scale extent to between 0.5 and 8:         Create and configure the zoom behavior     var zoomBehavior = d3.behavior.zoom           .scaleExtent [0.5, 8]          .on 'zoom', zoom ;         Add event listeners for the zoom gestures to the overlay     overlay.call zoomBehavior ;  When the user zooms or pans the overlay, a zoom event is triggered. The current event  is stored in the d3.event variable. Each event type has its own attributes. In the case  of the zoom event, the zoom translation vector and the scale are accessible through the  d3.event.translate and d3.event.scale attributes. We need to transform the scale  and the translation vector to the appropriate projection scale and rotation:  function zoom d  {         Compute the projection scale and the constant     var scale = d3.event.scale,         dx = d3.event.translate[0],         dy = d3.event.translate[1];         Maps the translation vector to rotation angles... }  The zoom event will be triggered several times when the user performs the drag  gesture. The translate array accumulates the horizontal and vertical translations  from the point where the drag gesture originated. If the user drags the globe from  the left-hand side to the right-hand side, the globe should be rotated 180 degrees,  counterclockwise. We will map the horizontal position of the translation vector to   an angle between 0 and 180 degrees:         Maps the translation vector to rotation angles     d.x = 180   width * dx;       Horizontal rotation     d.y = -180   height * dy;     Vertical rotation  [ 266 ]   If the user drags the North Pole towards the bottom of the image, we will want the  globe to rotate forward. As the latitude is measured from the equator to the poles, we  need to rotate the projection by a negative angle in order to have a rotation forward  from the point of view of the observer. With the rotation angle computed, we can  update the projection's rotate and scale attributes. The zoom scale is a relative  zoom factor, and we need to multiply it by the original size of the map to obtain the  updated scale of the projection:         Update the projection with the new rotation and scale     orthographic         .rotate [d.x, d.y]          .scale scale * d.scale ;  To update the image, we need to reproject the features and compute the svg paths.  The path has a reference to the projection instance, so we need to just update all the  paths in the svg with the updated projection:         Recompute the paths and the overlay radius     svg.selectAll 'path' .attr 'd', path ;     overlay.attr 'r', scale * height   2 ;  We also updated the overlay radius so that the dragging area coincides with   the globe, even if the user changes the zoom level. The globe can be rotated   and zoomed as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 267 ]   The globe can be rotated and zoomed with mouse or touch gestures, allowing the user  to explore every part of the globe in detail. The strategy to add rotation and zoom  behaviors can be used with any projection, adapting the mapping between the zoom  translation and scale to rotations and scale of the projection. Depending on the level  of detail of the features, there can be some performance issues during the rotation.  The projection and path generation are being done on each rotation step. This can be  avoided by rendering simpler features during the rotation, or even showing just the  graticule when rotating and rendering the features when the user releases the mouse.  The rotation of the globe is not perfect, but it's a good approximation of what we  would expect. For a better  but more complex  strategy, see the excellent article   from Jason Davies at https:  www.jasondavies.com maps rotate .  In the next section, we will use the Stereographic projection and the zoom behavior  to create an interactive star map.  Creating an interactive star map  In this section, we will use the Stereographic projection and a star catalog to create  an interactive celestial map. The Stereographic projection displays the sphere as seen  from inside. A star map created with the Stereographic projection is shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 268 ]   Celestial coordinate systems describe positions of celestial objects as seen from Earth.  As the Earth rotates on its axis and around the Sun, the position of the stars relative  to points on the surface of the Earth changes. Besides rotation and translation, a  third movement called precession slowly rotates the Earth's axis by one degree every  72 years. The Equatorial coordinate system describes the position of stars by two  coordinates, the declination and the angle from the projection of the Earth's equator  to the poles. This angle is equivalent to the Earth's longitude. The right ascension  is the angle measured from the intersection of the celestial equator to the ecliptic,  measured eastward. The ecliptic is the projection of the Earth's orbit in the celestial  sphere. The right ascension is measured in hours instead of degrees, but it is the  equivalent of longitude.  Choosing our star catalog To create our star map, we will use the HYG database, which is a celestial catalog  that combines information from the Hipparcos Catalog, the Yale Bright Star Catalog,  and the Gliese Catalog of Nearby Stars. This contains about 120,000 stars, most of  which are not visible to the naked eye. The most recent version of the HYG database  is available at https:  github.com astronexus HYG-Database.  As we did in the previous sections, we will add targets to Makefile in order to  download and parse the data files that we need. In order to filter and process the  stars of the catalog, we wrote a small Python script that filters out the less bright  stars and writes a GeoJSON file that translates the declination and right ascension  coordinates to equivalent latitudes and longitudes. Note that due to the rotation  of the Earth, the equivalent longitude is not related to the Earth's longitude, but it  would be useful to create our visualization. We can compute a coordinate equivalent  to the right ascension using the longitude = 360 * RA   24 - 180 expression.  The generated GeoJSON file will have the following structure:  {   "type": "FeatureCollection",    "features": [     {       "geometry": {         "type": "Point",          "coordinates": [-179.6006208, -77.06529438]       },       "type": "Feature",        "properties": {  [ 269 ]           "color": 1.254,          "name": "",          "mag": 4.78       }     },     ...   ]   }  In this case, every feature in the GeoJSON file is a point. We will begin by creating a  chart using the Equirectangular projection to have a complete view of the sky while  we are implementing the map and change the projection to stereographic later. We  begin by loading the GeoJSON data and creating the svg container for the map:  d3.json ' chapter11 data hyg.json', function error, data  {         Handle errors getting and parsing the data     if  error  { console.log error ; }         Container width and height     var width = 600, height = 300;         Select the container div and creates the svg container     var div = d3.select 'equirectangular' ,         svg = div.append 'svg'              .attr 'width', width              .attr 'height', height ;         Creates an instance of the Equirectangular projection... } ;  We create and configure an instance of the Equirectangular projection, setting the  scale to display the entire sky in the svg container:         Creates an instance of the Equirectangular projection     var projection = d3.geo.equirectangular           .scale width    2 * Math.PI           .translate [width   2, height   2] ;  [ 270 ]   Drawing the stars We will represent the stars with small circles, with bigger circles for brighter stars. For  this, we need to create a scale for the radius, which will map the apparent magnitude  of each star to a radius. Lower magnitude values correspond to brighter stars:         Magnitude extent     var magExtent = d3.extent data.features, function d  {         return d.properties.mag;      } ;         Compute the radius for the point features     var rScale = d3.scale.linear           .domain magExtent          .range [3, 1] ;  By default, the path generator will create circles of constant radius for features of the  Point type. We can configure the radius by setting the path's pathRadius attribute.  As we might use the same path generator to draw point features other than stars, we  will return a default value if the feature doesn't have the properties attribute:         Create and configure the geographic path generator     var path = d3.geo.path           .projection projection          .pointRadius function d  {             return d.properties ? rScale d.properties.mag  : 1;         } ;  With our path generator configured, we can append the graticule lines and the  features for the stars to the svg container:         Add graticule lines     var graticule = d3.geo.graticule  ;      svg.selectAll 'path.graticule-black' .data [graticule  ]          .enter  .append 'path'          .attr 'class', 'graticule-black'          .attr 'd', path ;         Draw the stars in the chart     svg.selectAll 'path.star-black' .data data.features          .enter  .append 'path'          .attr 'class', 'star-black'          .attr 'd', path ;  [ 271 ]   We obtain the following celestial map, which shows us the graticule and the stars as  small black circles:  Celestial map created with the Equirectangular projection  Changing the projection and adding rotation We will replace the Equirectangular projection with the Stereographic projection and  add styles to the elements of the map to make it more attractive. We will use the drag  behavior to allow the user to rotate the chart. As we did with the rotating globe, we  will create a variable to store the current rotation of the projection:         Store the current rotation of the projection     var rotate = {x: 0, y: 45};  We can create and configure an instance of the Stereographic projection. We will  choose a suitable scale, translate the projection center to the center of the svg container,  and clip the projection to show only a small part of the sphere at a time. We use the  rotation variable to set the initial rotation of the projection:         Create an instance of the Stereographic projection     var projection = d3.geo.stereographic           .scale 1.5 * height   Math.PI          .translate [width   2, height   2]          .clipAngle 120          .rotate [rotate.x, -rotate.y] ;  [ 272 ]   We won't duplicate the code to create the svg container, graticule, and features  because it's very similar to the rotating globe from earlier. The complete code for this  example is available in the chapter11 03-celestial-sphere file. In this example,  we also have an invisible overlay. We create and configure a drag behavior instance  and add event listeners for the drag gesture to the invisible overlay:         Create and configure the drag behavior     var dragBehavior = d3.behavior.drag           .on 'drag', drag ;         Add event listeners for drag gestures to the overlay     overlay.call dragBehavior ;  The drag function will be invoked when the user drags the map. For drag events,  the d3.event object stores the gesture's x and y coordinates. We will transform  the coordinates to horizontal and vertical rotations of the projection with the same  method as the one used in the previous section:         Callback for drag gestures     function drag d  {            Compute the projection rotation angles          d.x = 180 * d3.event.x   width;         d.y = -180 * d3.event.y   height;             Updates the projection rotation...     }  We update the projection rotation and the paths of the stars and graticule lines.   As we have clipping in this example, the path will be undefined for stars outside   the clipping angle. In this case, we return a dummy svg command that just moves  the drawing cursor to avoid getting errors:             Updates the projection rotation                 projection.rotate [d.x, d.y] ;             Update the paths for the stars and graticule lines         stars.attr 'd', function u  {             return path u  ? path u  : 'M 10 10';         } ;         lines.attr 'd', path ;  [ 273 ]   In the style sheet file, chapter11 maps.css, we have included styles for this map   to display a dark blue background, light graticule lines, and white stars. The result   is a rotating star map that displays a coarse approximation of how the stars look  from Earth.  Rotating star map created with the Stereographic projection  Adding colors and labels to the stars We will create a fullscreen version of the star map. The source code for this version  of the map is available in the chapter11 04-fullscreen file in the code bundle.  For this example, we need to set the body element and the container div to cover  the complete viewport. We set the width and height of the body, HTML, and the  container div to 100 percent and set the padding and margins to zero. To create the  svg element with the correct size, we need to retrieve the width and height in pixels,  which are computed by the browser when it renders the page:         Computes the width and height of the container div     var width = parseInt div.style 'width' , 10 ,         height = parseInt div.style 'height' , 10 ;  [ 274 ]   We create the projection and the path generator as done earlier. In this version, we  will add colors to the stars. Each star feature contains the attribute color, which  indicates the color index of the star. The color index is a number that characterizes  the color of the star. We can't compute a precise scale for the color index, but we will  use a color scale that approximates the colors:         Approximation of the colors of the stars     var cScale = d3.scale.linear           .domain [-0.3, 0, 0.6, 0.8, 1.42]          .range ['6495ed', 'fff', 'fcff6c', 'ffb439',             'ff4039'] ;  We will set the color to the features using the fill attribute of the paths that  correspond to the stars:         Add the star features to the svg container     var stars = svg.selectAll 'path.star-color'          .data data.features          .enter  .append 'path'          .attr 'class', 'star-color'          .attr 'd', path          .attr 'fill', function d  {              return cScale d.properties.color ;          } ;  We will also add labels for each star. Here, we use the projection directly to compute  the position where the labels should be, and we also compute a small offset:     Add labels for the stars var name = svg.selectAll 'text' .data data.features      .enter  .append 'text'      .attr 'class', 'star-label'      .attr 'x', function d  {         return projection d.geometry.coordinates [0] + 8;     }      .attr 'y', function d  {         return projection d.geometry.coordinates [1] + 8;     }      .text function d  { return d.properties.name; }      .attr 'fill', 'white' ;  [ 275 ]   The star map visualization in fullscreen is shown in the following screenshot:  We create the overlay and the drag behavior and configure the callback of the zoom  event as earlier, updating the position of the labels in the zoom function. Now we  have a fullscreen rotating star map.  Projecting raster images with D3  Until now, we have used svg to create maps. In this section, we will learn how to use  D3 to project raster images in canvas elements. This will allow us to use JPG or PNG  images to generate orthographic views of these images. A raster image reprojected  using the Orthographic projection is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 276 ]   Rendering an image of Earth using the Orthographic projection  or any other  projection  involves manipulating two projections. First, for each pixel in the original  image, we compute its corresponding geographic coordinates using the image  inverse projection. Then, we use the geographic coordinates of each pixel to render  them using the Orthographic projection. Before beginning the implementation of  these steps, we will discuss the inverse method of a projection.  Projections are functions that map geographic coordinates to points on the screen.  The inverse projections do the reverse operation; they take coordinates on the   two-dimensional surface and return geographic coordinates. In the chapter11 05- raster file, there is an interactive example that computes the geographic coordinates  of the point under the mouse. Note that not all projections in D3 have an inverse  operation. Computing the geographic coordinates of a point under the mouse is  shown in the following screenshot:  [ 277 ]   To obtain the geographic coordinates that correspond to a point under the cursor,   we can add a callback to the mouseover event over an element:         Callback of the mouseover event     rect.on 'mousemove', function   {            Compute the mouse position and the corresponding            geographic coordinates.         var pos = d3.mouse this ,         coords = equirectangular.invert pos ;      }   The Next Generation Blue Marble images are satellite images of Earth captured,  processed, and shared by NASA. There are monthly images that show Earth with  a resolution of 1 pixel every 500 meters. These images are available in several  resolutions at the NASA Earth Observatory site at http:  earthobservatory. nasa.gov Features BlueMarble . We will use a low-resolution version of the   Blue Marble image in this section.  Rendering the raster image with canvas This time, we won't use svg to create our visualization, because we need to render  individual pixels in the screen. Canvas is more suitable for this task. We will begin by  creating a canvas element, loading the Blue Marble image, and drawing the image in  the canvas element. We select a container div and append a canvas element, setting its  width and height as follows:     Canvas element width and height var width = 600,     height = 300;     Append the canvas element to the container div var div = d3.select 'canvas-image' ,     canvas = div.append 'canvas'          .attr 'width', width          .attr 'height', height ;  The canvas element is just a container. To draw shapes, we need to get the 2D  context. Remember that only the 2d context exists:         Get the 2D context of the canvas instance     var context = canvas.node  .getContext '2d' ;  [ 278 ]   Then, we create an instance of Image. We set the image source and set a callback that  can be be invoked when the image is fully loaded:         Create the image element     var image = new Image;     image.onload = onLoad;     image.src = ' chapter11 data world.jpg';  In the onLoad function, we use the canvas context to draw the image. The arguments  of the drawImage method are the image, the offset, and size of the source image   and the offset and size of the target image. In this case, the original image size   is 5400 x 2700 pixels; the target image size is just 600 x 300 pixels:         Copy the image to the canvas context     functiononLoad   {         context.drawImage image, 0, 0, image.width, image.height,             0, 0, width, height ;     }  The Blue Marble image rendered in a canvas element is shown in the   following screenshot:  As the Blue Marble image was created using the Equirectangular projection, we  can create an instance of this projection and use the invert method to compute the  longitude and latitude that corresponds to each pixel:         Create and configure the Equirectancular projection     var equirectangular = d3.geo.equirectangular           .scale width    2 * Math.PI           .translate [width   2, height   2] ;  [ 279 ]   Computing the geographic coordinates of  each pixel We can add an event listener for the mousemove event on the canvas element.   The d3.mouse method returns the position of the mouse relative to its argument,   in this case, the canvas element:         Add an event listener for the mousemove event     canvas.on 'mousemove', function d  {             Retrieve the mouse position relative to the canvas         var pos = d3.mouse this ;             Compute the coordinates of the current position     } ;  We can use the invert method of the projection to compute the geographic  coordinates of the point under the cursor. To display the geographic coordinates  that correspond to the position of the cursor, we clear a small rectangle of the canvas  content and add fillText to add the label in the upper-left corner of the image:             Compute the coordinates of the current position         var coords = equirectangular.invert pos ;             Create a label string, showing the coordinates         var label = [fmt coords[0] , fmt coords[1] ].join ', ' ;             Cleans a small rectangle and append the label         context.clearRect 2, 2, 90, 14 ;         context.fillText label, 4, 12 ;  Using the invert method to compute geographic coordinates is shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 280 ]   Reprojecting the image using the  Orthographic projection Until now, we have learned how to copy an image element in canvas and how to  use the invert method of a projection to compute the geographic coordinates that  correspond to a pixel in the canvas element. We will use this to reproject the raster  image using the Orthographic projection instead of the original Equirectangular  projection. The strategy to project the image into a different projection is as follows:     Insert the source image in the canvas element, setting its width and height.    Create an instance of the source projection  the projection used to generate   the image  and configure it in a way that if it were used to project the world,  it would fit exactly with the source image.     Create an empty target image. The size of this image should fit the    target projection.     Create and configure an instance of the target projection. In this case, we will   use an instance of the Orthographic projection.     For each pixel in the target image, use the invert method of the target   projection to compute the geographic coordinates that correspond to that  pixel. Using the source projection, compute the pixel coordinates of that  location, and copy the pixel data to the pixel in the target image.  [ 281 ]   The procedure sounds a little convoluted, but it's basically about copying the pixels  from the source image to the target image using the geographic coordinates in order  to know where each pixel can be copied to.  We begin by drawing the source image in the canvas element once the image is fully  loaded. Images in canvas are represented as arrays. We read the data array of the  source data and created an empty target image and got its data:     Copy the image to the canvas context function onLoad   {         Copy the image to the canvas area     context.drawImage image, 0, 0, image.width, image.height ;         Reads the source image data from the canvas context     var sourceData = context.getImageData 0, 0, image.width,         image.height .data;         Creates an empty target image and gets its data     var target = context.createImageData image.width,         image.height ,     targetData = target.data;         ... }  Note that the target image is not shown yet, but we will use it later. In canvas,  images are not stored as matrices; they are stored as arrays. Each pixel has four  elements in the array, which are its red, green, blue, and alpha components. The  rows of the image are stored sequentially in the image array. With this structure, for  an image of 200 x 100 pixels, the index of the red component of the pixel 23 x 12 will  be 4 *  200 * 11 + 23  = 844.  To make things easier, we will iterate the image data as if it were a matrix, computing  the index of each pixel with the aforementioned expression. We iterate in columns  and rows of the target image and compute the corresponding coordinates of the  current pixel using the invert method of the target projection:     Iterate in the target image for  var x = 0, w = image.width; x < w; x += 1  {     for  var y = 0, h = image.height; y < h; y += 1  {             Compute the geographic coordinates of the current pixel  [ 282 ]           var coords = orthographic.invert [x, y] ;             ...     } }  The inverse projection could be undefined for a given pixel; we need to check this  before we try to use it. We can now use the source projection to compute the pixel  coordinates of the current location in the source image. This is the pixel that we need  to copy to the current pixel in the target image:             Source and target image indices         var targetIndex, sourceIndex, pixels;             Check if the inverse projection is defined         if   !isNaN coords[0]   &&  !isNaN coords[1]    {                 Compute the source pixel coordinates             pixels = equirectangular coords ;                 ...         }  Knowing which source pixel we need to copy, we need to compute the  corresponding index in the source and target image data arrays. The projection   could have returned decimal numbers, so we will need to approximate them to  integers. We will also ensure that the indices of the red channel for both images  should be exactly divisible by four:             Compute the index of the red channel         sourceIndex = 4 *  Math.floor pixels[0]  + w *             Math.floor pixels[1]  ;         sourceIndex = sourceIndex -  sourceIndex % 4 ;          targetIndex = 4 *  x + w * y ;         targetIndex = targetIndex -  targetIndex % 4 ;  We can copy the color channels using the indices that were just computed:             Copy the red, green, blue and alpha channels         targetData[targetIndex]     = sourceData[sourceIndex];         targetData[targetIndex + 1] = sourceData[sourceIndex + 1];         targetData[targetIndex + 2] = sourceData[sourceIndex + 2];         targetData[targetIndex + 3] = sourceData[sourceIndex + 3];  [ 283 ]   When we finish iterating, the target image data array should be complete and   ready to be drawn in the canvas container. We can clear the canvas area and   copy the target image:         Clear the canvas element and copy the target image     context.clearRect 0, 0, image.width, image.height ;     context.putImageData target, 0, 0 ;  We obtain the Blue Marble image that is displayed using the Orthographic projection.  The Blue Marble image rendered using the Orthographic projection is shown in the  following screenshot:  There is more to know about reprojecting raster images. For instance, Jason Davies  has a demo on projecting raster tiles and adding zoom behavior at http:  www. jasondavies.com maps raster . Also, Nathan Vander Wilt has a well-documented  demo on how to use WebGL to reproject raster images using the GPU at http:   andyet.iriscouch.com world _design webgl demo2.html.  [ 284 ]   Summary  In this chapter, we used several cartographic projections to create interactive maps  that can be zoomed and rotated. We created a globe that can be rotated and zoomed  using the zoom behavior and the Orthographic projection. We used the Stereographic  projection and the HYG combined catalog to create an interactive star map.  We also learned how to use the canvas elements and a combination of projections to  project raster images of the Earth using arbitrary projections, creating realistic views  of the Earth.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to add social media to our visualization projects  and how to have several users interact with our visualizations at the same time.  [ 285 ]    Creating a Real-time  Application  In this chapter, we will create a real-time application to explore the distribution of  geotagged tweets containing user-defined topics. Creating this visualization will  involve implementing a server-side application and a client-side application.  The server-side application will handle connections from the clients, receive topics to  be heard on Twitter, and send tweets matching the topics to the corresponding clients.  The client-side application will connect with the streaming server, send it topics as  the user enters the streaming server, receive tweets, and update the visualization as  the tweets arrive.  We will begin this chapter by learning the basics of real-time interaction in   client-side applications. We will use the HDI Explorer application from Chapter 8,  Data-driven Applications, a service that provides the necessary backend to implement  real-time applications. We will then implement the server-side application using Node, Twit, and Socket. IO, a library that provides real-time communication support. Lastly, we will use  Backbone, Socket.IO, and D3 to create the client-side application.  Collaborating in real time with Firebase  In some visualization projects, it can be convenient to have the application state  shared among users so that they can collaborate and explore the visualization   as a group.   Adding this feature would usually imply the installation and configuration  of a server and the use of WebSockets or a similar technology to manage the  communication between the server and client-side code in the browser. Firebase is a  service that provides real-time data storage and synchronization between application  instances using the client-side code. If the data changes at one location, Firebase will  notify the connected clients so that they can update the state of the application. It  has libraries for several platforms, including OS X, iOS, Java, and JavaScript. In this  section, we will use Firebase's JavaScript library to add real-time synchronization to  the HDI Explorer application.  Adding synchronization to HDI Explorer doesn't make sense in most cases; it would  be weird if a user is seeing the evolution of the Human Development Index for  one country and it suddenly changes to a different country. On the other hand, if  several users were seeing the same visualization on their respective computers and  discussing it, this would be useful because changing the selected country would  update the visualization for the rest of the users as well, so they would all see the  same content. To differentiate between the two scenarios, we will create a new page  of the HDI Explorer application with synchronization and leave the index and share  pages as they are now. The examples of this section are in the firebase.md file of the  hdi-explorer repository.  Configuring Firebase To add real-time support to our application, we need to create a Firebase account.  Firebase offers a free plan for development, allowing up to 50 connections and  100 MB of data storage, which is more than enough for our application. Once we  have created our Firebase account, we can add a new application. The name of our  application will be hdi-explorer. This name will be used to generate the URL that  identifies our application, in our case, http:  hdi-explorer.firebaseio.com.  By accessing this URL, we can see and modify the application data. We will create  a single object with the code attribute to store the country code of the HDI Explorer  application. Once we have our account and initial data configured, we can install the  JavaScript library with Bower:  $ bower install --save-dev firebase  [ 288 ]   This will install Firebase in the bower_components directory. We will also update the  Gruntfile to concatenate the Firebase library along with the other dependencies of  our application in the dependencies.min.js file. Firebase data for the HDI Explorer  application is shown in the following screenshot:  We can connect to the Firebase application using the Firebase client. We will create a  script element at the end of the firebase.md page that contains the synchronization  code and create an instance of the Firebase reference to our data:           Connect to the Firebase application     var dataref = new Firebase 'https:  hdi-explorer.firebaseio. com ' ;         Application callbacks...    Integrating the application with Firebase Before integrating Firebase, we will review the structure of the HDI Explorer  application. We used Backbone to organize the components of the application   and the REST API of the World Bank as the data source for our models.  Our application has three models, that is, the ApplicationModel, CountryTrend,  and CountryInformation models. The application model manages the application  state, which is defined by the three-letter code of the country selected by the  user. The country trend model contains the time series of the aggregated Human  Development Index, and the country information model contains information about  the main components of the index: education, life expectancy, and average income.  [ 289 ]   The Countries collection contains instances of the CountryTrend model. This  collection has two views, the search view and the chart of the HDI trends. The  CountryInformation model has one associated view, the table of indicators   at the right-hand side of the page. The HDI Explorer application is shown in   the following screenshot:  All these elements are initialized in the app setup.js file; instances are created  and the callbacks for the change:code event in the application model are defined.  The views will update themselves when the user selects a country in the search  field. To synchronize the application state among the connected users, we need to  synchronize the country code.  We can read the data from Firebase through asynchronous callbacks. These callbacks  will be invoked in the same way for both the initial state and for the changes in the  data. Events will be triggered if any object under the current location is changed,  added, removed, or moved. The value event will be triggered for any of these  modifications. We will use this event to update the application state as follows:     Update the application state dataref.on 'value', function snapshot  {     app.state.set 'code', snapshot.val  .code ; } ;  [ 290 ]   When something changes under the current location  such as the country code , the  value event will be triggered, and the callback will be called with a snapshot of the  current data as the argument. The snapshot will contain the most up-to-date object,  representing the state of our application. We can access the object by calling the  val   method of the snapshot and get the value of the current country code.  If we modify the value of the code in Firebase, users connected to the same URL will  have their application instances updated. We also want to synchronize the state from  the application to Firebase. We will add an event listener to the application model in  order to update the Firebase data:     The model will update the object with the selected country code. app.state.on 'change:code', function model  {     dataref.set {code: model.get 'code' } ; } ;  The set method will update the contents of the Firebase location, triggering  an update of all the views of the local application instance and any other client  connected to the firebase page.  In this section, we learned how to add real-time interaction to the application created  in Chapter 8, Data-driven Applications. We learned how to change the state of the  client-side application by adding callbacks for the events triggered at the backend.  Creating a Twitter explorer application  In this section, we will create an application to explore the distribution of geotagged  tweets at a given time. Users can enter topics in the input box. The topics will be sent  to the server-side application, which will begin to send tweets that match the topic  to the client-side instance of the corresponding user. This application can be used  to track the geographic distribution of a set of topics. For instance, a user might be  interested to know which kind of meal is being discussed in different regions of the  world, to monitor the Twitter stream for earthquake-related words, or to track the  mentions of a particular brand. Our application will support multiple users to be  connected at the same time, allowing each user to add up to five topics.  [ 291 ]   A screenshot of the client application is shown as follows:  Our application will consist of two components, the streaming server and the   client-side application. The streaming server will handle the connection with   clients, a global list of topics to track, connect to the Twitter-streaming API, and  deliver tweets that match the topics to the corresponding client. When a client  disconnects, the server will remove the client's topics from the topics list. We will  implement the streaming server in Node using Socket.IO to handle the connection  with the user and send them tweets, and the Twit module to handle the connection  to the Twitter-streaming API.  The client-side application will establish the connection with the streaming  server, send new topics as they are added, and update the bar chart and the map  components. We will use Backbone, Bootstrap, Socket.IO, and D3 to implement   the client-side application.  We will begin by learning how to use the Twitter-streaming API and Socket.IO to  implement the streaming server and then implement the client application.  [ 292 ]   Creating the streaming server  In this section, we will use Node to create the streaming server. The server will  handle the client connections and the connection to the Twitter-streaming API; it   will also manage the list of topics for all the clients who deliver tweets as they arrive.  We will begin by creating Twitter authentication tokens; we will learn how to use the  Twit module to manage the connection to the Twitter API, and how to use Socket.IO  to handle real-time communication between the server and the client application.  To follow the examples in this section, open the chirp-server project directory in  the terminal and run the following command to install the project dependencies:  $ npm install  This will create the node_modules directory and download the project dependencies.  If you haven't installed Node, download the binaries for your platform from   http:  nodejs.org download  and follow the instructions on the page.  Using the Twitter-streaming API Twitter provides a streaming API that allows developers to access Twitter's global  stream of tweets through several endpoints. The following endpoints allow access   to different streams:     statuses sample: This allows access to a small random sample of public  statuses. All the applications connected to this endpoint will receive the   same tweets.     statuses filter: This returns public statuses that match one or more   predicates. We will use this endpoint in the project.     statuses firehose: This returns all the public statuses. This endpoint   requires special access.  Also, there are the statuses user and statuses site endpoints, which allow  you to access the public tweets of a particular user or website. When applications  establish a connection with the Twitter endpoint, they are delivered a feed of tweets.  To run the examples in this chapter, you need to go to the Twitter Application  Management page  https:  apps.twitter.com  , create a new application, and  generate API keys for the application. You will need the consumer key, the consumer  secret, the access token, and the token secret.  [ 293 ]   The credentials.js file in the root directory of the project contains placeholders for  the authentication tokens of the application. You can either replace the placeholder  strings in this file with your own keys or create a new file with the same structure. In  either case, make sure that the keys remain a secret. It would be a good idea to add  this file to the .gitignore file in order to avoid accidentally pushing it to GitHub:     Authentication tokens  replace with your own  module.exports = {     "consumer_key":        "xxx",     "consumer_secret":     "xxx",     "access_token":        "xxx",     "access_token_secret": "xxx" }  Using Twit to access the Twitter-streaming API As mentioned earlier, we will use the Twit Node module  you can access the  documentation in the project's repository at https:  github.com ttezel  twit   to connect to the Twitter-streaming API. Twit handles both the REST and  streaming APIs, keeping the connection alive and reconnecting automatically if the  connection drops. The 01-twitter-sample.js file contains the code to connect to  the statuses sample stream. We begin by importing the twit module and loading  the configuration module:     Import node modules var Twit   = require 'twit' ,                 Twitter API Client     config = require '. credentials.js' ;     Credentials  The config object will contain the authentication tokens from the credentials. js file. We can now set the Twitter credentials and connect to the statuses sample  stream as follows:     Configure the Twit object with the application credentials var T = new Twit config ;     Subscribe to the sample stream and begin listening var stream = T.stream 'statuses sample' ;  The stream object is an instance of EventEmitter, a built-in Node class that allows  you to emit custom events and add listener functions to these events. To begin  listening to tweets, we can just attach a listener to the tweet event:     The callback will be invoked on each tweet.  stream.on 'tweet', function tweet  {         Do something with the tweet } ;  [ 294 ]   The tweet object will contain information about the tweet, such as the date of  creation, tweet ID in the numeric and string formats, tweet text, information about  the user who generated the tweet, and language and tweet entities that may be  present, such as hashtags and mentions. For a complete reference to the tweet  attributes, refer to the Field Guide at https:  dev.twitter.com docs platform- objects tweets. A typical tweet will have the following structure, along with many  other attributes:  {    created_at: 'Thu May 15 22:27:37 +0000 2014',   ...   text: 'tweet text...',   user: {      name: 'Pablo Navarro',     screen_name: 'pnavarrc',     ...   },   ...   coordinates: {      type: 'Point',      coordinates: [ -76.786264, -33.234588 ]    },   ...   entities: {      hashtags: [],     ...   },   lang: 'en' }  You may have noticed that the coordinates attribute is a GeoJSON object, in  particular, a GeoJSON point. This point is an approximation of where the tweet   was generated. Less than 10 percent of the tweets in the sample stream contain   this information, but the information is still useful and interesting to explore.  The stream object will emit other events that we might need to handle. The connect  event will be emitted when Twit attempts to connect to the Twitter-streaming API:  stream.on 'connect', function msg  {     console.log 'Connection attempt.' ; } ;  [ 295 ]   If the connection is successful, the connected event will be triggered. Note that when  the application is running, the connection to the Twitter stream can be interrupted  several times. Twit will automatically try to reconnect following the reconnection  guidelines from Twitter:     The connection is successful. stream.on 'connected', function msg  {     console.log 'Connection successful.' ; } ;  If a reconnection is scheduled, the reconnect event will be emitted, passing   the request, response, and interval within milliseconds of the next reconnection   attempt as follows:     Emitted when a reconnection is scheduled. stream.on 'reconnect', function req, res, interval  {     console.log 'Reconnecting in ' +  interval   1e3  + '         seconds.' ; } ;  Twitter creates a queue with the tweets to be delivered to our application. If our  program doesn't process the tweets fast enough, the queue will get longer, and  Twitter will send a warning message to the application notifying us about the issue.  If this happens, Twit will emit the warning event, passing the warning message as an  argument to the callback function:     The application is not processing the tweets fast enough. stream.on 'warning', function msg  {     console.warning 'warning'  } ;  Twitter can disconnect the stream for several reasons. Before actually dropping   the connection, Twitter will notify us about the disconnection, and Twit will emit   the corresponding event as well. The complete list of events can be consulted in the  Twit project repository at https:  github.com ttezel twit.  In the project repository, there are examples of connections to the statuses sample  and statuses filter streams. In the 01-twitter-sample.js file, we configure the  Twitter credentials and use the statuses sample endpoint to print the tweets in the  terminal screen. To run this example  remember to add your credentials , type the  following command in the root directory of the project:  $ node 01-twitter-sample.js  [ 296 ]   This will print the tweets on the console as they are received. As mentioned earlier,  there are more streaming endpoints available. The statuses filter stream allows  you to track specific topics. The stream object receives a list of comma-separated  strings, which should contain the words to be matched. If we pass the topics good  morning and breakfast, the stream will contain tweets that match either the word  breakfast or both good and morning. Twit allows us to specify the topics that need  to be matched as a list of strings.  In the 02-twitter-filter.js file, we have the same setup as in the first example;  however, in this case, we define the list of topics to track and configure the stream to  connect to the statuses filter endpoint, passing along the list of topics to track:     List of topics to track var topics = ['good morning', 'breakfast'];     Subscribe to a specific list of topics var stream = T.stream 'statuses filter', {track: topics} ;  To determine a match, Twitter will compare the tracking topics with the tweet text, the  user name, screen name, and entities, such as hashtags and URLs. Note that the tweets  won't include information about which term was matched; as our application will need  this information, we will check which terms were matched in the tweet callback.  Using Socket.IO Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that allows real-time communication between the  client and the server. The library has two parts, the client-side library that runs in   the browser and the server-side library for Node.  In this example, we will create an application that will allow you to send text  messages to the server, which will send a text message back to inform you that the  message was received. To follow the code in this example, open the 03-socketio- example.js file for the server-side code and the socketio-example.html file for   the client-side code. A screenshot of the client-side application is shown as follows:  [ 297 ]   We will begin by implementing the server-side code. In the server-side code,   we import the socket.io module. This will expose the Socket.IO server:     Import the Socket.IO module var IOServer = require 'socket.io' ;  We can now create an instance of the Socket.IO server. We can either use the   built-in server or an instance of a different server, such as those provided by the  HTTP or express modules. We will use the built-in version, passing along the port  number for the server:      Start the server, listening on port 7000 var io = new IOServer 7000 ;  The server is ready to receive connections and messages. At this point, the server  won't do anything other than listen; we need to attach a callback function for the  connection event. The callback will receive a socket object as the argument. The  socket is the client-side endpoint of the connection. Refer to the following code:     Listen for connections from incoming sockets io.on 'connection', function socket  {         Print the socket ID on connection     console.log 'Client ' + socket.id + ' connected.' ;         Attach listeners to socket events...  } ;  This callback will display a log when a client connects to the server, displaying the  socket ID:  $ node 03-socketio-example.js  Client ID pk0XiCmUNgDVRP6zAAAC connected.  We can now attach event listeners to the socket events. We will add a callback for the  disconnect event, which will display a log message:     Displays a log message if the client disconnects. socket.on 'disconnect', function   {     console.log 'client disconnected.' ; } ;  [ 298 ]   We can attach listeners for custom events as well, and send JavaScript objects that  can be serialized as arguments for the callback. Socket.IO also supports the sending  of binary data. We will add a callback for the client-message custom event:     The server will emit a response message. socket.on 'client-message', function  data  {     socket.emit 'server-message', {         msg: 'Message "' + data.msg + '" received.'     } ; } ;  The callback for the client-message event will just send a message back to the  client, indicating that the message was received. If we want to send a message   to all the connected clients, we can use io.emit 'event name', parameters .  Socket.IO will serve the client-side library, which can be very useful. We can use  either this version or download the client-side library separately. We can use the  served version by adding  socket.io socket.io.js to the server's URL. To  follow the client-side code, open the socketio-example.html file from the project  directory. In this example, we will use the served version, adding the following line  in the header:  <script     src="http:  localhost:7000 socket.io socket.io.js">   Note that if you want to use the server from an external device, you should replace  localhost with the URL of the server. We will add an input element in the page,  where the user will type the messages to the server. Under the input element, a list will  display the messages both from the client and the server. The older messages will be  displaced to the bottom as new messages are received. Refer to the following code:      Socket.IO Example                Message              <input type="text" class="form-control input-sm"  id="msgToServer" placeholder="Send a message to the server.">        [ 299 ]        Send                  We will add a script with the code, which will establish the connection with the server  and update the messages list. We will include D3 to handle the user input and to  update the list of messages. We begin by opening a connection with the socket server:     Open a connection with the Socket.IO server var socket = io 'http:  localhost:7000' ;  Note that in this case, the socket variable refers to the server's endpoint. The client  API is almost identical to the server API; the socket object will also trigger the  connect event once the connection with the server is established:     The callback will be invoked when the connection establishes socket.on 'connect', function   {     console.log 'Successful connection to the server.' ; } ;  We will store each message, sender, and message timestamp in an array to display  the messages in a list. We will also create a time formatter to display the timestamp  of each message in a friendly format:     Declare variables for the message list and the time formatter var messages = [],     dateFmt = d3.time.format '[%H:%M:%S]' ;  We will select the input element with the message ID and attach a listener for  the submit event. The callback for the event will retrieve the content of the input  element and send the message to the server. We use d3.event.preventDefault    to prevent the form from trying to submit the form values to the server:  d3.select 'msg-form .on 'submit', function   {      var inputElement = d3.select 'message .node  ,         message = inputElement.value.trim  ;         Check that the message is not empty     if  message  {  [ 300 ]              Sends the message to the server...         }      d3.event.preventDefault  ; } ;  We retrieve the contents of the input element and verify that the message is not  empty before we send the client-message signal. We also reset the input element  value so that the user can write a new message without having to erase the message  already sent:         Check that the message is not empty     if  message  {            Sends the message to the server         socket.emit 'client-message', {msg: message} ;             Append the message to the message list         messages.push {             from: 'client',              date: new Date  ,              msg: message         } ;             Update the list of messages         updateMessages  ;             Resets the form, clearing the input element         this.reset  ;          }  In the updateMessages function, we will sort the messages by date, create a selection  for the li elements, and append them on to the enter selection. The li elements  will contain the time of the message, who sent the message, and the contents of the  message. We will also add a class indicating who sent the message in order to set  different colors for the server and the client:     Update the message list function updateMessages   {         Sort the messages, most recent first     messages.sort function a, b  { return b.date - a.date; } ;         Create the selection for the list elements     var li = d3.select 'msg-list'   [ 301 ]           .selectAll 'li' .data messages ;         Append the list elements on enter     li.enter  .append 'li' ;         Update the list class and content.     li         .attr 'class', function d  { return d.from; }          .html function d  {           return [dateFmt d.date , d.from, ':', d.msg].join ' ' ;         } ; }  The message list will be updated when the user sends a message to the server and  when the server sends a message to the client. The application allows the sending  and receiving of messages to the server, as shown in the following screenshot:  Implementing the streaming server In the previous sections, we learned how to use the Twit module to connect and  receive tweets from the Twitter-streaming API's endpoints. We also learned how to  implement bidirectional communication between a Node server and the connected  clients using the Socket.IO module. In this section, we will use both the modules   Twit and Socket.IO  to create a server that allows multiple clients to track their  own topics on Twitter in real time.  When the user accesses the application, a connection with the streaming server  is established. Socket.IO will manage this connection, reconnecting and sending  heartbeats if necessary. The user can then add up to five words to be tracked by   the streaming server.  [ 302 ]   The streaming server will manage connections with the connected clients and one  connection with the Twitter-streaming API. When a client adds a new topic, the  streaming server will add it to the topics list. When a new tweet arrives, the server  will examine its contents to check whether it matches any of the terms in the topic   list and send a simplified version of the tweet to the corresponding client.  The code of the streaming server is in the chirp.js file in the top level of the project  directory. We will begin by importing the Node modules and the credentials.js  file, which exports the Twitter authentication tokens:     Import the Node modules var Twit     = require 'twit' ,     IOServer = require 'socket.io' ,     config   = require '. credentials.js' ;  To keep track of the correspondence between the topics and clients, we will store  the topic and a reference to the topic in the topics list. For instance, if the client  with socket adds the word 'breakfast', we will add the {word: 'breakfast',  client: socket} object to the topics list:     List of topics to track var topics = [];  As mentioned in the previous sections, we can use either the statuses sample  or the statuses filter endpoints to capture tweets. We will use the statuses  filter endpoint in our application, but instead of filtering by topic, we will filter by  location and language  tweets in English only . We will set the locations parameter  to '-180,-90,180,90', meaning that we want results from anywhere in the world,  and set the language parameter to 'en'. Passing a list of words to the statuses  filter endpoint will force us to reset the connection when the user adds a new  topic. This is a waste of resources, and Twitter could apply rate limits if we open  and close connections frequently. We will use the statuses filter endpoint to  listen to anything in the stream and filter the words we want. This will allow you  to add or remove words from the topics list without having to reset the connection.  We will initialize the Twit object, which will read the Twitter credentials and store  them to create the streaming requests to Twitter. We will also create the stream to  the statuses filter endpoint and store a reference to it in the twitterStream  variable. We will filter only using the language  English  and location  the world ,  and match the items by comparing the topic word with the tweet contents:     Configure the Twit object with the application credentials var T = new Twit config ;     Filter by location  the world  and tweets in English var filterOptions = {  [ 303 ]       locations: '-180,-90,180,90',      language: 'en'};     Creates a new stream object, tracking the updated topic list var twitterStream = T.stream 'statuses filter', filterOptions ;  We will define functions to handle the most important Twit stream events. Most  of these callbacks will just log a message in the console, stating that the event has  occurred. We will define a callback for the connect event, which will be triggered  when a connection is attempted, and a callback for the connected event, which   will be emitted when the connection to the Twitter stream is established:     Connection attempt  'connect' event  function twitOnConnect req  {     console.log '[Twitter] Connecting...' ; }     Successful connection  'connected' event  function twitOnConnected res  {     console.log '[Twitter] Connection successful.' ; }  We will display a log message if a reconnection is scheduled, indicating the interval  in seconds:     Reconnection scheduled  'reconnect' event . function twitOnReconnect req, res, interval  {     var secs = Math.round interval   1e3 ;     console.log '[Twitter] Disconnected. Reconnection scheduled in         ' + secs + ' seconds.' ; }  We will also add callbacks for the disconnect and limit events, which will occur  when Twitter sends a disconnect or limit message, respectively. Note that Twit  will close the connection if it receives the disconnect message, but not if it receives  the limit message. In the limit callback, we will display a message and stop the  stream explicitly:     Disconnect message from Twitter  'disconnect' event  function twitOnDisconnect disconnectMessage  {        Twit will stop itself before emitting the event     console.log '[Twitter] Disconnected.' ; }     Limit message from Twitter  'limit' event  function twitOnLimit limitMessage  {  [ 304 ]          We stop the stream explicitely.     console.log '[Twitter] Limit message received. Stopping.' ;     twitterStream.stop  ; }  Adding log messages for these events can help debug issues or help us know what  is happening if we don't receive messages for a while. The event that we should  certainly listen for is the tweet event, which will be emitted when a tweet is  delivered by the streaming endpoint. The callback of the event will receive   the tweet object as the argument.  As mentioned earlier, we will only send geotagged tweets to the connected clients.  We will check whether the tweet text matches any of the terms in the topics list. If a  term is found in the tweet text, we will send a simplified version of the tweet to the  client who added the term:     A tweet is received  'tweet' event  function twitOnTweet tweet  {         Exits if the tweet doesn't have geographic coordinates     if  !tweet.coordinates  { return; }         Convert the tweet text to lowercase to find the topics     var tweetText = tweet.text.toLowerCase  ;         Check if any of the topics are contained in the tweet text     topics.forEach function topic  {             Checks if the tweet text contains the topic         if  tweetText.indexOf topic.word  !== -1  {                 Sends a simplified version of the tweet to the                 client             topic.socket.emit 'tweet', {                 id: tweet.id,                 coordinates: tweet.coordinates,                 word: topic.word             } ;         }     } ; }  [ 305 ]   As we are not using the tweet text or its creation date, we will send just the tweet ID,  the coordinates, and the matched word to the client. We can now attach the listeners  to their corresponding events as follows:     Add listeners for the stream events to the stream instance twitterStream.on 'tweet',      twitOnTweet ; twitterStream.on 'connect',    twitOnConnect ; twitterStream.on 'connected',  twitOnConnected ; twitterStream.on 'reconnect',  twitOnReconnect ; twitterStream.on 'limit',      twitOnLimit ; twitterStream.on 'disconnect', twitOnDisconnect ;  We have initialized the connection to the Twitter-streaming API, but as we don't  have any topics in our list, nothing will happen. We need to create the Socket.IO  server to handle connections with clients, which can add topics to the list. We will  begin by defining the port where the Socket.IO server will listen and creating an  instance of the server. Note that we can create an instance of the Socket.IO server  with or without the new keyword:     Create a new instance of the Socket.IO Server var port = 9720,     io = new IOServer port ;     Displays a message at startup console.log 'Listening for incoming connections in port ' + port ;  The io server will begin listening for incoming connections on port 9720. We can   use other port numbers too; remember that ports between 0 and 1023 are privileged,  as they require a higher level of permission to bind.  When a client connects, the connection event will be emitted by the io server,  passing the socket as an argument to the event callback. In this case, we will display  a log message in the console, indicating that a new connection was established, and  add listeners for the socket events:     A client's established a connection with the server io.on 'connection', function socket  {         Displays a message in the console when a client connects     console.log 'Client ', socket.id, ' connected.' ;         Add listeners for the socket events... } ;  [ 306 ]   The socket object is a reference to the client endpoint in the communication. If the  client adds a new topic, the add custom event will be emitted, passing the added topic  to the event callback. In the callback for this event, we will append the word and a  reference to the socket to the topic list and display a log message in the console:         The client adds a new topic     socket.on 'add', function topic  {            Adds the new topic to the topic list         topics.push {             word: topic.word.toLowerCase  ,              socket: socket         } ;          console.log 'Adding the topic "' + topic.word + '"' ;     } ;  When the client disconnects, we will remove its topics from the list and display a log  message in the terminal:         If the client disconnects, we remove its topics from the         list     socket.on 'disconnect', function   {         console.log 'Client ' + socket.id + ' disconnected.' ;         topics = topics.filter function topic  {             return topic.socket.id !== socket.id;         } ;     } ;  At this point, the server is capable of handling multiple clients connected at the same  time, each adding their own terms to the topic list. When we implement  and access   the client-side application, we will have the streaming server generate logs such as  the following:  $ node chirp.js  Listening for incoming connections in port 9720  [Twitter] Connecting...  [Twitter] Connection successful.  Client 4WDFIrqsbxtf_NO_AAAA connected.  Adding the topic "day"  Adding the topic "night"  Client 4WDFIrqsbxtf_NO_AAAA disconnected.  [ 307 ]   Client P8mb97GiLOhc-noLAAAB connected.  Adding the topic "coffee"  Adding the topic "tea"  Adding the topic "milk"  Adding the topic "beer"  [Twitter] Connecting...  [Twitter] Connection successful.  Client P8mb97GiLOhc-noLAAAB disconnected.  Client p3lFgVrxGI0bLPOFAAAC connected.    ...  [Twitter] Disconnected. Reconnection scheduled in 0 seconds.  In the next section, we will use the client-side Socket.IO library, D3, and Backbone to  create a visualization that shows the geographic distribution of tweets matching the  user-defined topics.  Creating the client application  In the previous section, we implemented the streaming server. The server application  allows other applications to send words that you can listen to from the statuses  sample endpoint from Twitter. When the server receives geotagged tweets containing  the words tracked by a client, it will deliver the client a simplified version of the tweet.  The server doesn't enforce what the client applications do with the tweets; the client  application could just count the tweets, visualize the frequency of each term in time  with a heat map, or create a network chart showing the co-occurrence of the terms.  In this section, we will implement a client application. The application will display  a map showing the location of the tweets that match each term in a world map,  and will display a bar chart that will display the count for each term. As we did in  Chapter 6, Interaction between Charts, we will use Backbone and D3 to structure our  application. A screenshot of the application is shown as follows:  [ 308 ]   The code of the application is available in the chapter12 chirp-client folder.   We will begin by describing the project structure, and then implement the   project components.  The application structure As mentioned earlier, we will use Backbone to structure the application's components.  As we want to visualize the places where different topics are mentioned in the world  at any given time, we will define a topic as the main component of our application.  A topic will contain a word  the string that we want to track in Twitter , a color to  visualize it, and a list of matching tweets. We will create a Topic model containing  these attributes.  We will create a collection for the topics. The collection will be in charge of creating  the topic instances when the user adds words in the input element and appending  the tweets to the corresponding topic instance as they arrive. We will provide our  collection with three views: the world map view, the barchart view, and the input  element, where the user can add a new topic.  [ 309 ]   The code for the application components will be in the src app directory in the  project folder. We will have separate directories for the models, collections, and  views of our application; we will have the app.js and setup.js files to define   the application namespace and to set up and launch our application:    app      app.js     models      collections      views      setup.js  We will encapsulate the components of our application under the App variable,  which is defined in the app app.js file. We will add attributes for the collections,  models, and views to the App object, as follows:     Define the application namespace var App = {     Collections: {},       Models:      {},     Views:       {} };  To run the application, run the server application and go to the chirp-client  directory and start a static server. The Gruntfile of the project contains a task to  run a static server in the development mode. Install the Node modules with the  following command:  $ npm install  After installing the project dependencies, run grunt serve. This will serve the files  in the directory as static assets and open the browser in the correct port. We will  review the application models and views.  Models and collections The main component of our application will be the Topic model. A Topic instance  will have a word, color, and an array of simplified tweets matching the topic's word.  We will define our model in the app models topic.js file. The Topic model will be  created by extending the Backbone.Model object:     Topic Model App.Models.Topic = Backbone.Model.extend {         The 'word' attribute will uniquely identify our topic  [ 310 ]       idAttribute: 'word',         Default model values     defaults: function   {         return {             word:   'topic',             color:  '555',             tweets: []         };     },         addTweet method... } ;  The word string will uniquely identify our models in a collection. The topics will  be given a color to identify them in the bar chart and the map views. Each topic  instance will contain an array of tweets that match the word of the topic. We will add  a method to add tweets to the array; in this method, we will add the topic's color.  Array attributes  such as the tweets property  are treated as pointers; mutating the  array won't trigger the change event. Note that we could also create a model and  collection for the tweets, but we will use an array for simplicity.  We will trigger this event explicitly to notify potential observers that the array   has changed:         Adds a tweet to the 'tweets' array.     addTweet: function tweet  {             Adds the color of the topic         tweet.color = this.get 'color' ;             Append the tweet to the tweets array         this.get 'tweets' .push tweet ;             We trigger the event explicitly         this.trigger 'change:tweets' ;     }  Note that it is not necessary to define the default values for our model, but we will add  them so that we remember the names of the attributes when describing the example.  [ 311 ]   We will also create a collection for our topics. The Topics collection will manage  the creation of the Topic instances and add tweets to the corresponding collection  as they arrive from the server. We will make the socket endpoint accessible to the  Topics collection, passing it as an option when creating the Topic instance. We will  bind the on socket event to a function that will add the tweet to the corresponding  topic. We also set a callback for the add event to set the color for a topic when a new  instance is created, as shown in the following code snippet:     Topics Collection App.Collections.Topics = Backbone.Collection.extend {         The collection model     model: App.Models.Topic,         Collection Initialization     initialize: function models, options  {          this.socket = options.socket;             Store the current 'this' context         var self = this;          this.socket.on 'tweet', function tweet  {             self.addTweet tweet ;         } ;          this.on 'add', function topic  {             topic.set 'color', App.Colors[this.length - 1] ;             this.socket.emit 'add', {word: topic.get 'word' } ;         } ;     },         Add tweet method... } ;  The addTweet method of the collection will find the topic that matches the  tweet's word attribute and append the tweet using the addTweet method of the  corresponding topic instance:      addTweet: function tweet  {             Gets the corresponding model instance.  [ 312 ]           var topic = this.get tweet.word ;             Push the tweet object to the tweets array.         if  topic  {             topic.addTweet tweet ;         }     }  Implementing the topics views In our application, we only need views for the Topics collection and for the  application itself. We will have a view associated with the bar chart, a view for the  map of tweets, and a view for the input element, which will be used to create new  topic instances. The code for each of these views is in the src app views directory in  the topics-barchart.js, topics-map.js, and topics-input.js files, respectively. The input view The input element will allow the user to add a new topic. The user can write a new  topic in the input box and click on the Send button to send it to the server and add it  to the list of watched topics. The input element is shown in the following screenshot:  To render this view, we will create a template with the markup of the form. We will  add the template under the body tag in the index.html document:        <form role="form" class="form-horizontal form-inline" id="topic-      form">              Message        <input type="text" class="form-control input-sm" id="new-          topic" placeholder="Add a new topic">       <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default btn-          sm">Send               [ 313 ]   We will implement this view by extending the Backbone.View object. The template  attribute will contain the compiled template. In this case, the template doesn't have  placeholder text to be replaced when rendering, but we will keep _.template   to  allow the use of template variables in the future:     Topic Input App.Views.TopicsInput = Backbone.View.extend {         Compile the view template     template: _.template $ 'topics-template' .html   ,         DOM Events     events: {         'submit topic-form': 'addOnSubmit',     },      initialize: function  options  {            The input element will be disabled if the collection             has five or more items         this.listenTo this.collection, 'add', this.disableInput ;     },      render: function    {            Renders the input element in the view element         this.$el.html this.template this.collection.toJSON    ;         return this;     },      disableInput: function   {            Disable the input element if the collection has five or             more items     },      addOnSubmit: function e  {             adds a topic when the user press the send button     } } ;  [ 314 ]   We will allow up to five topics by a user to avoid having too many similar   colors in the map. We have limited space for the bar chart as well, and having an  unlimited number of topics per user could have an impact on the performance of  the server. When a new topic instance is created in the collection, we will invoke  the disableInput method, which will disable the input element if our collection  contains five or more elements:      disableInput: function   {          Disable the input element if the collection has five or           more items         if  this.collection.length >= 5  {             this.$ 'input' .attr 'disabled', true ;         }     },  To add a new topic, the user can type the terms in the input element as soon as the  Send button is pressed. When the user clicks on the Send button, the submit event  is triggered, and the event is passed as an argument to the addOnSubmit method. In  this method, the default action of the form is prevented as this would cause the page  to reload, the topic is added to the topics collection, and the input element is cleared:      addOnSubmit: function e  {             Prevents the page from reloading         e.preventDefault  ;             Content of the input element         var word = this.$ 'input' .val  .trim  ;             Adds the topic to the collection and cleans the input         if  word  {             this.collection.add {word: word} ;             this.$ 'input' .val '' ;         }     }  [ 315 ]   The bar chart view The bar chart view will encapsulate a reusable bar chart made in D3. We will  describe the view and then comment on the implementation of the chart. For now,  we will just need to know about the interface of the chart. The code for the bar chart  view is available in the src app views topics-barchart.js file. A bar chart  showing the tweet count for a set of topics is shown in the following screenshot:  We begin by extending and customizing the Backbone.View object. We add the  chart attribute, which will contain a configured instance of the charts.barChart  reusable chart. The bar chart will receive an array of objects that will be used to  create the bars. The label attribute allows you to set a function to compute the label  for each bar. The value attribute will allow you to configure the value that will be  mapped to the bar's length, and the color attribute will allow you to configure the  color of each bar. We set functions for each one of these attributes, assuming that our  array will contain elements with the word, count, and color properties:     Bar Chart View App.Views.TopicsBarchart = Backbone.View.extend {         Create and configure the bar chart     chart: charts.barChart           .label function d  { return d.word; }          .value function d  { return d.count; }          .color function d  { return d.color; } ,      initialize: function    {            Initialize the view     },      render: function    {            Updates the chart     } } ;  [ 316 ]   In the initialize method, we add a callback for the change:tweets event in the  collection. Note that the change:tweets event is triggered by the topic instances; the  collection just echoes the events. We will also render the view when a new topic is  added to the collection:      initialize: function    {            Render the view when a tweet arrives and when a new             topic is added         this.listenTo this.collection, 'change:tweets',             this.render ;         this.listenTo this.collection, 'add', this.render ;     },  The render method will construct the data array in the format required by the chart,  computing the count attribute for each topic; this method will select the container  element and update the chart. Note that the toJSON collection method returns a  JavaScript object, not a string representation of an object in the JSON format:      render: function    {             Transform the collection to a plain JSON object         var data = this.collection.toJSON  ;             Compute the tweet count for each topic         data.forEach function item  {             item.count = item.tweets.length;         } ;             Compute the container div width and height         var div = d3.select this.el ,             width  = parseInt div.style 'width' , 10 ,             height = parseInt div.style 'height' , 10 ;             Adjust the chart width and height         this.chart.width width .height height ;             Select the container element and update the chart         div.data [data] .call this.chart ;         return this;     }  [ 317 ]   The topics map view In the topics map view, the tweets from all the topics will be drawn as points in a  map, with each tweet colored as per the corresponding topic. The code of this view is  in the src app topics-map.js file. Tweets for each topic in a world map is shown  in the following screenshot:  To create this view, we will use the charts.map reusable chart, which will render  an array of GeoJSON features and a GeoJSON object base. This chart uses the  equirectangular projection; this is important to set the width and height in a ratio  of 2:1. In the initialize method, we set the base GeoJSON object provided in the  options object. In this case, the options.geojson object is a feature collection with  countries from Natural Earth. We will render the view only when a tweet arrives:     Topics Map View App.Views.TopicsMap = Backbone.View.extend {         Create and configure the map chart     chart: charts.map           .feature function d  { return d.coordinates; }          .color function d  { return d.color; } ,      initialize: function  options  {            Sets the GeoJSON object with the world map         this.chart.geojson options.geojson ;             Render the view when a new tweet arrives         this.listenTo this.collection, 'change:tweets',           this.render ;  [ 318 ]       },      render: function    {             Gather the tweets for all the topics in one array         var tweets =  _.flatten _.pluck this.collection.toJSON  ,             'tweets'  ;             Select the container element         var div = d3.select this.el ,             width  = parseInt div.style 'width' ,  10 ;             Update the chart width, height and scale         this.chart             .width width              .height width   2              .scale width    2 * Math.PI  ;             Update the chart         div.data [tweets] .call this.chart ;         return this;     } } ;  In the render method, we gather the tweets for all the topics in one array, select   the container element, and update the chart. The geotagged tweets will be drawn   as small points on the world map.  Creating the application view We will create a view for the application itself. This is not really necessary, but  we will do it to keep things organized. We will need a template that contains the  markup for the application components. In this case, we will have a row for the  header, which will contain the page title, lead paragraph, input element, and bar  chart. Under the header, we will reserve a space for the map with the tweets:                        [ 319 ]          chirp explorer         Exploring geotagged tweets in real-time.                                                                                  The application view implementation is in the src app views application.js file.  In this case, we don't need to compile a template for the view, but we will compile it  if we add template variables as the application name or lead text:     Application View App.Views.Application = Backbone.View.extend {         Compile the applicaiton template     template: _.template $ 'application-template' .html   ,         Render the application template in the container     render: function   {         this.$el.html this.template   ;         return this;     } } ;  In the render method, we will just insert the contents of the template in the container  element. This will put the markup of the template in the container defined when  instantiating the view.  [ 320 ]   The application setup With our models, collections, and views ready, we can proceed to create   the instances and wire things up. The initialization of the application is in the   src app setup.js file. We begin by creating the app variable to hold the instances  of collections and views. When the DOM is ready, we will invoke the function that  will create the instances of our views and collections:     Container for the application instances var app = {};     Invoke the function when the document is ready $ function   {        Create application instances... } ;  We begin by creating an instance of the application view and setting the container  element to the div with the application-container ID. The application view  doesn't have an associated model or collection; we can render the view immediately  as shown in the following code:         Create the application view and renders it     app.applicationView = new App.Views.Application {         el: 'application-container'     } ;     app.applicationView.render  ;  We can create an instance of the Topics collection. At the beginning, the collection  will be empty, waiting for the user to create new topics. We will create a connection  to the streaming server and pass a reference to the server endpoint as well as to  the collection of topics. Remember that in the initialization method of the Topics  collection, we add a callback for the tweet event of the socket, which adds the tweet  to the corresponding collection. Remember to change localhost to an accessible  URL if you want to use the application on another device:         Creates the topics collection, passing the socket instance     app.topicList = new App.Collections.Topics [], {         socket: io.connect 'http:  localhost:9720'      } ;  As we have an instance of the Topics collection, we can proceed to create   instances for the topic views. We create an instance of the TopicsInput view,   the TopicsBarchart view, and the TopicsMap view:         Input View     app.topicsInputView = new App.Views.TopicsInput {  [ 321 ]           el: 'topics-form',         collection: app.topicList     } ;         Bar Chart View     app.topicsBarchartView = new App.Views.TopicsBarchart {         el: 'topics-barchart',         collection: app.topicList     } ;         Map View     app.topicsMapView = new App.Views.TopicsMap {         el: 'topics-map',         collection: app.topicList     } ;  In the map chart of the TopicsMap view, we need a GeoJSON object with the  feature or feature collection to show as the background. We use d3.json to load  the TopoJSON file containing the world's countries and convert it to the equivalent  GeoJSON object using the TopoJSON library. We use this GeoJSON object to update  the map chart's geojson attribute and render the view. This will display the map  that shows the world's countries:         Loads the TopoJSON countries file     d3.json 'dist data countries.json', function error, geodata  {          if  error  {                Handles errors getting or parsing the file             console.error 'Error getting or parsing the TopoJSON                 file' ;             throw error;         }             Transform from TopoJSON to GeoJSON         var geojson = topojson.feature geodata,             geodata.objects.countries ;             Update the map chart and render the map view         app.topicsMapView.chart.geojson geojson ;         app.topicsMapView.render  ;     } ;  [ 322 ]   Finally, we render the views for the topicList collection:         Render the Topic Views     app.topicsInputView.render  ;     app.topicsBarchartView.render  ;     app.topicsMapView.render  ;  At this point, we will have the input element, an empty bar chart, and the world  map without tweet points. As soon as the user adds a topic, the server will begin to  deliver tweets, which will appear in the views. The application and rendered topic  views can be seen in the following screenshot:  [ 323 ]   Let's recapitulate how the client application works. Once the views are rendered, the  user can add topics by typing words in the input box. When the Enter key is pressed,  the contents of the input element will be added as the word attribute of a new topic  instance. The collection will send the word to the streaming server, which will add  the topic and a reference to the client in the topics list. The server will be connected  to the Twitter-streaming API. Each time the server receives a geotagged tweet, it will  compare the tweet text with the topics in the list; if a match is found, a simplified  version of the tweet will be sent to the client. In the client, the tweet will be added   to the tweets array of the topic that matches the tweet text. This will trigger the  views to render, updating the bar chart and the map. Here, we can guess where  people are having their breakfast and where they are having dinner, as shown in   the following screenshot:  [ 324 ]   The streaming server can be used with any application that can send the add  event and receive the tweets when the server emits the tweet event. We chose to  create a client to visualize the geographic distribution of tweets, but we could have  implemented a different representation of the same data. If you want to experiment,  use the streaming server as a base component to create your own client visualization.  Here are some suggestions:     The time dimension was neglected in this application. It might be interesting   to display a heat map that shows how the tweet count varies in time or  makes the old tweets fade away.     Adding zoom and pan to the map chart could be useful to study the   geographic distribution of tweets at a more local level.     The user can't remove topics once they are created; adding a way to remove   topics can be useful if the user decides that a topic was not interesting.     Use brushing to allow the user to select tweets only from a particular region  of the world. This would probably involve modifying the server such that it  sends the tweets from that location to the client who selected it.     Use a library of sentiment analysis and add information on whether the topic   was mentioned in a positive or negative way.     Add the ability to show and hide topics so that the overlapping doesn't    hide information.  Summary  In the last chapter of the book, we learned how to use D3 and Socket.IO to create  a real-time visualization of geotagged tweets. In this chapter, we described two  applications: the streaming server and the client application.  We implemented the streaming server in Node. The streaming server keeps a  persistent connection to the Twitter-streaming endpoints and supports several  connected users at the same time, with each user adding topics to be tracked on   the Twitter-streaming API. When the tweets match one of the user topics, they   are delivered to the corresponding client.  [ 325 ]   In the client application, we used Backbone, Socket.IO, and D3 to create a visualization  of where the topics are defined by the user in the world. The user can add topics at any  given time; the server will add the topic to its list and begin to send tweets that match  the topic to the client.  Through this book, we learned how to use D3 to create several kinds of charts, but  mostly, we learned how to create visual components that can be reused across several  projects. We learned how to integrate D3 and reusable charts with other libraries to  structure applications better, how to deploy web applications, and how to add real-time  updates to the charts. As we have seen in the examples of this book, D3 is powerful and  flexible, making it especially attractive for tinkerers and creative developers.
