He switched to using Oracle APEX in 2007 after using   MOD_PLSQL for years - "APEX is much better".  He has had the good fortune of consulting for a wide variety of organizations  in industries, including commercial fishery management, mineral resources,  superannuation regulation, property asset management, distance education, casinos,  and debt collection.  Mark is an Oracle ACE, having been actively involved in the Oracle community  for many years on national and state committees, as well as writing articles and  presenting at conferences.  He is the AUSOUG QLD Branch President, and maintains a blog at   http:  oracleinsights.blogspot.com.  One of the really nice things about working with Oracle APEX is  the sense of community you gain through the forums with people  scattered all over the globe.     I've had the good fortune to have met face to face with several  members of the APEX development team and APEX enthusiasts  after communicating with them via forums and e-mails. It's really  surprising how much personality comes through in the written word.    One of the strengths of APEX is how accessible the APEX  development team is to the development community. They really are  interested in your feedback and making the APEX better. It's a real  buzz when one of your suggestions is incorporated into the product.    Finally, I'd like to thank my beautiful wife Jackie for giving me the  time and support to write this book. Oh, and for continuing to put  up with me for over twenty years now. You rock my world.

Application Express  APEX  is a rapid web application development tool  integrated directly into the Oracle database. APEX is a completely web-based  application featuring many ready to use components, allowing developers to build  and deploy professional web applications rapidly. Using SQL and PL SQL as  the development language it provides a number of advanced features out of the  box, including several authentication mechanisms such as Lightweight Directory  Access Protocol  LDAP , Data Access Descriptors  DAD , Single Sign-On  SSO ,  authorization services, built-in session state management, and logging functionality.  Modern websites are moving towards Rich Internet Applications  RIA , where web  applications have many characteristics of desktop applications. This has led to the  growing popularity in JavaScript libraries to provide that rich interactivity and ease  the burden of providing support for multiple web browsers.  There are several excellent JavaScript libraries which provide functionality to  retrieve, traverse, and manipulate the Document Object Model  DOM  using   cross-browser compatible code. They also provide cross-browser event handling and  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML  AJAX  functionality, for request and response  objects to exchange data between the browser and server, avoiding full page reloads.  The story is very different when you examine the User Interface  UI  and User  Experience  UX  enhancements currently offered by JavaScript libraries. Major  libraries such as jQuery, Prototype, and MooTools choose to limit the UI and UX  functionality offered. Developers are forced to integrate officially sanctioned UI  extension libraries with limited sets of UI components, such as jQuery UI,   Prototypes Scripty2, and MooTools.More.js extension, or integrate third-party  unsupported widgets.  The notable exceptions here are the Yahoo! User Interface library  YUI  and Ext JS.   Preface  YUI provides a large collection of UI widgets in version 2, including buttons, tabs,  trees, menus, sliders, charting, dialogs, rich text editors, and more. YUI released   YUI 3 in September 2009, completely rebuilding the library from the ground up. In  2011, some of the major widgets have been migrated to YUI 3, with many more still  to be migrated. YUI widgets have basic CSS styling only, requiring you to modify the  CSS to achieve a professional finish. While YUI is a mature library, its UI components  and documentation feel unfinished.  Ext JS also provides the UI widgets including tabs, charts, windows, trees, desktop  styled toolbars, menus, rich text editors, calendars, layout managers, ComboBoxes,  and many more. All the Ext JS widgets are styled to a very high standard, giving a  professional interface out of the box. They are designed to be customizable, and at  the same time, allow you to re-theme them to suit your own requirements.   The Ext JS widgets are built using an advanced JavaScript application development  framework, with components constructed using object-oriented design principles.  This allows you to modify the existing components easily, or combine and extend  them to develop custom components.  Documentation of the Ext JS API is well organized, with clear descriptions of  configuration options, properties, methods, and events for each of the components  and classes making up the library. Support services include an extensive library of  examples, showing individual and combined samples, very active public forums,  and premium support forums.  Combining APEX with the very professional Ext JS UI components allows  developers to build amazing web applications rapidly using the latest Rich Internet  Application functionality.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment, takes you through  the process of setting up a productive development environment for both Oracle  Application Express  APEX  and Ext JS options for setting up a local installation,  where you have direct access to the database. Web servers are covered, including  the Oracle HTTP Server, the Embedded PL SQL Gateway, and the Oracle APEX  Listener. Setting up on a hosted environment, where you only have web browser  access, is also covered.   Automating your build processes is a great way to improve productivity. We set   up a source code repository, integrating an automated backup and commit  process as the first step to aid your development. A number of other automation  opportunities are also discussed. By the end of the chapter, you will be fully set up  and ready to code.  [ 2 ]   Preface  Chapter 2, Getting Acquainted with Ext, introduces the Ext JS API, spending time  familiarizing you with some of the functionality Ext JS provides for manipulating the  Document Object Model  DOM . Topics covered include how to build a standalone  testing page, cross-browser element manipulation using the Ext.Element class,  DOM traversal using the Ext.DomQuery class, and defining event handlers to add  interactivity to your web pages.   Many of the examples are run using the Mozilla Firefox browser with the Firebug  Plug-in. Firebug provides fantastic debugging tools for inspecting and editing the  HTML, DOM, JavaScript, and CSS components that make up a web page. It also  includes a JavaScript console, allowing you to inspect JavaScript errors and execute  JavaScript code. This chapter shows you how to make use of the Firebug   command-line console for quick prototyping and testing. Chapter 3, Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX, provides a background on APEX themes  and how to create a theme from scratch. A page template is developed based on the  Ext.Viewport component, starting with a standalone prototype, before integrating it  into an APEX page template.  Applying JavaScript DOM manipulation to page elements can result in input items  appearing outside the form element, with some very nasty side effects. This chapter  demonstrates the issue and shows the consequences, before providing a solution to  ensure that this never happens to you. Chapter 4, Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists, develops templates for regions, labels,  and lists using Ext JS components. Static region templates based on Ext.Panel are  created, and then collapsible versions are added with a few lines of JavaScript to the  templates. Inline error messages for labels can cause issues with page layout, so you  are shown how Ext.QuickTips can be used to neatly solve the problem. Simple list  templates are developed before a more complex example implementing a TreePanel  is developed, showing how templates can also be used to produce JavaScript code  and JSON objects, and not just HTML. Chapter 5, Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports, develops templates for  the remaining template types: Buttons, popup list of values, breadcrumbs, calendars,  and reports. The Ext JS Grid component is one of the most advanced and widely  used components in the library. For the report template, you will learn how to "fake  it", using the built-in functionality of an APEX Classic report and combining it with  some CSS, so it looks like a read-only Ext JS Grid with AJAX paging.  Once the template types are completed, you are shown how to remove unused  templates quickly using the APEXExportSplitter Java class, before publishing   the theme.  [ 3 ]               Preface  Chapter 6, Adding Ext Layout Elements, offers a number of "low-hanging fruit"  solutions, providing you with functionality that can significantly and broadly  improve parts of your application with minimal implementation effort.  Some of the solutions improve existing HTML components, such as automatically  replacing the APEX Classic DatePicker with the advanced Ext.DatePicker  component, a solution to make all text areas resizable, or better still, auto-sizing so that  text areas automatically grow as you type. Select lists are automatically transformed  to combo boxes allowing lists to filter data progressively as more keys are typed.  Completely new functionality using Ext JS components includes a tab panel template  using APEX 4.0 nested sub regions, along with a toolbar and menu template. Chapter 7, Working with Plug-ins and Dynamic Actions, introduces Plug-ins   and Dynamic Actions, two of the most exciting new features in APEX 4.0 for  developers. For the first time, you have the ability to add custom "widgets" easily  and directly into APEX that can be used declaratively in the same way as native  APEX components. Plug-ins and Dynamic Actions are supported with back-end  integration, allowing developers to make use of APEX provided PL SQL APIs to  simplify component development.   APEX 4.0 introduced the Number Field as a new item type, allowing you to  configure number range checks by optionally specifying minimum and maximum  value attributes. This chapter provides a gentle introduction to the Plug-ins and  Dynamic Actions, building a better Number Field than the native APEX item type. Chapter 8, Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions, continues working  with Plug-ins, creating a complex ComboBox Plug-in, dealing with more advanced  Plug-in concepts, including AJAX processing and interacting with Dynamic Actions.   ComboBoxes use data stores, providing the Ext JS framework with the ability to  store data on the client browser, acting much as an in-memory database. This makes  the process of integrating AJAX functionality into Plug-ins far simpler, because  AJAX processes are focused on just passing data between the client browser and the  database. The Ext components already contain the client-side functionality to update  the display.  For the ComboBox, you are taken through the process of modifying the Ext JS  components to work within the Dynamic Actions framework. Chapter 9, Getting Interactive with GridPanels, integrates the Ext JS GridPanel, one  of the most powerful and widely used components in Ext JS, into APEX. Taking the  approach of extending existing functionality in APEX, the GridPanel is integrated as  a Plug-in for classic reports.  [ 4 ]   Preface  The GridPanel Plug-in includes column management features including sorting,  resizing, drag-and-drop column reordering, and show hide columns. APEX  functionality is combined to make the GridPanel stateful, saving user settings back  into APEX preferences. Chapter 10, IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows, shows you how iFrames can  completely transform the way your APEX applications work. This chapter looks at  using iFrames in three different ways: Embedding other pages within a page using  iFramed Panels, making modal popup windows, and creating a tabbed document  interface, allowing users to easily switch backward and forward between pages  without opening multiple browser tabs. Chapter 11, Performance Tuning your JavaScript, rounds out the book by looking at  performance tuning your JavaScript. Topics look at ways of keeping JavaScript  lightweight, using recommendations from Yahoo! and Google add-ons for Firebug.  Reducing file size at the source is also covered, learning how to use JSBuilder2 to build  a customized lighter version of the Ext Library with unused components removed.  JSBuilder2 is also used to combine and minify custom application JavaScript.  What you need for this book At the absolute minimum, this book requires basic skills in Oracle Application  Express, access to an Oracle Application Express development environment through  a web browser, and the Ext JS library.   Oracle Application Express and Ext JS library are both directly accessible on   the Internet:   	 Oracle provides an online Application Express evaluation instance, where   you can request a workspace   	 Sencha provides free CDN hosting  cache delivery network  for the    Ext JS framework  Productivity wise, a better approach is to set yourself up properly with a local  environment. Typically this will be a development database and web server, set up by  your company's database administrators, but could just as easily be Oracle Database  Express Edition  XE , a free edition of the database running on your computer.  Running a local web server on your computer will greatly assist with JavaScript  development, saving time by editing the file directly on the web server, rather than  the save-deploy-test cycle. It also reduces friction in a team environment, when that  little change you make breaks every page in the application. You can happily work  in isolation until you are ready to deploy to a wider audience.  [ 5 ]   Preface  Having good editing and debugging tools makes any developer more productive.  Long gone are the days where Oracle database development was done using  SQL*Plus and Notepad  or vi . Most developers will already have their favorite  editor, either one of the excellent free tools SQL Developer or JDeveloper provided  by Oracle, or an equivalent commercial product.  Similarly, you can do web development using any plain text editor to edit   your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A more powerful open source environment is  Aptana Studio.  Aptana Studio is a complete web development environment that combines  powerful authoring tools for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides JavaScript  code completion for all the popular JavaScript libraries including Ext JS, and even  provides code completion for your own JavaScript libraries.  Mozilla Firefox and Firebug are an absolute must have for working on your live  application. Firebug allows you to edit, debug, and monitor CSS, HTML, and  JavaScript live in any web page.   Many of the examples in this book depend entirely on Firebug, either issuing  commands from the console, inspecting HTML, and CSS, or inspecting and  debugging AJAX requests from the browser to the server.  You'll also need other tools such as image editors, version control, and FTP tools, but  they are less essential at the beginning.  Who this book is for This book is intended for application developers who are building web applications  using the Oracle Application Express development environment.  In combination with Ext JS, a cross-browser JavaScript library for building rich  internet applications, you will learn how to create an innovative, visually appealing  web user interface with most of the characteristics of the desktop applications.  The majority of Oracle Application Express developers come from a database  development background, so they already have the necessary database skills,   but are less familiar with web development HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.  You may already be an experienced Application Express developer, looking to take  your applications to the next level, to go beyond the "out of the box" functionality.  If so, this book is for you.  [ 6 ]   Conventions In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between  different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an  explanation of their meaning.  Code words in text are shown as follows: "In the earlier custom build I've kept the  pkg-grid-editor.js package for editable grids"   Preface  A block of code is set as follows:  function createMyPanel config  {     return new Ext.Panel Ext.apply {            Pre-configured config options go here         width: 300,         height: 300,         plugins: [ new Ext.ux.MyPluginClass   ]     }, config  ; };  When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the  relevant lines or items are set in bold:          listeners: {             render: function p {                 new Ext.Resizable p.getEl  , {                     handles: 'all',                     pinned: true,                     transparent: true,                     resizeElement: function  {                         var box = this.proxy.getBox  ;                         p.updateBox box ;                         if  p.layout  {                             p.doLayout  ;                         }                         if  Ext.isIE  {                             this.syncHandleHeight  ;                         }                         return box;                     }                 } ;             }         }  [ 7 ]    Preface  Errata Although we have taken every care to ensure the accuracy of our content, mistakes  do happen.

[ 9 ]    Setting up an Oracle APEX  and Ext JS Environment  In this chapter, we will go through the process of setting up a productive  development environment for both Oracle Application Express  APEX  and Ext JS.   APEX applications are accessed by a web browser via an HTTP Server, which may  use the Oracle APEX Listener, Oracle HTTP Server with the mod_plsql plug-in, or  the Embedded PL SQL Gateway to act as the web server.   Each of the web server options has advantages and disadvantages. We will examine  the relevant merits of each option separately, before showing how to configure them  to support development with Ext JS.  Setting up a development environment is more than just installing the relevant  software. It's also about managing versioning and dependencies of your code, and  configuration files and other project assets. Automating your backup and build  processes ensures that you are able to deliver your software in a repeatable and  consistent manner. Regular software releases should be a straightforward activity  and not a major issue.  Making good choices setting up your development environment at the beginning of  a project can be enormously beneficial for the entire lifecycle of the project. Getting it  wrong can be equally as bad!  This chapter covers:   	 APEX installation considerations  	 Brief overview of the Ext JS SDK  	 Merits of each of the web tier options: Oracle APEX Listener, Oracle HTTP   Server with the mod_plsql plug-in, and the Embedded PL SQL Gateway   Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment   	 Loading the Ext JS SDK on each of the web tier options, and also onto hosted   environments where you don't have direct access to the web server   	 Setting up a Subversion source code repository for project assets  	 Automating backup and build processes to simplify application deployments   and reduce errors  By the end of the chapter, you will be fully set up and ready to code.  Setting up for success One of the reasons for the outstanding success of Oracle APEX is that you can build  applications really quickly. Within a couple of hours, you can have a development  database set up, and using the built-in themes, you've started building an application.  This can be really dangerous for us as developers. At the beginning of a project,  particularly when you're using a new or unfamiliar technology, there is a pressure  to prove yourself—either as an individual starting a new role or as a team proving a  technology to management.  Experienced programmers recognize this; the challenge is convincing everyone  involved on what the ultimate goals of the project are, and not just take a short-term,  short-sighted approach.   While not a dedicated practitioner of the methodology, some of the principles behind  the Agile Manifesto  http:  agilemanifesto.org principles.html  are a great  reminder of on what we should be focusing.  The ultimate goal of any project is to write valuable software, and by valuable I mean  software that is going to be used and is useful. There is no point writing software  unless it delivers real business outcomes—either tangibly in increasing business  revenue, streamlining business processes, or less directly by reducing time spent on  non-productive activities.  Working software is the primary measure of progress. The more time that we,  as developers, can spend on regularly delivering valuable software in short time  periods, the more successful our project is.   Regularly deploying working software implies that we need an efficient build  process. This is the art of maximizing the amount of work not done! By taking a  little extra time at the beginning to set up our development environment properly, it  should be largely self sustaining and require almost no ongoing maintenance.  [ 12 ]    Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment  Similarly, taking the individual Oracle APEX tablespace offline to perform a  data recovery operation allows other applications to remain online, providing  better overall availability. Or in another scenario, take advantage of transportable  tablespaces to copy your Oracle APEX environment to another database quickly.  Downloading Ext JS The Ext JS SDK  software development toolkit  can be downloaded as a single  zipped file from the Sencha website at http:  www.sencha.com products extjs  download. This book is based on version 3.3.1, the latest release at the time of  writing. As the Ext framework is now quite mature, you should be safe to use later  releases of version 3 with this book, should they be available.  Ext JS is released under both open source and commercial licenses to suit both  implementations and provides support to developers through community support  forums, as well as subscription-based support and maintenance.  The download of the Ext JS SDK is nearly 15MB, and once extracted, is roughly  105MB. The reason for the large size becomes apparent once we start examining the  extracted files.  [ 14 ]   The screenshot shows the contents of the top directory within the Ext JS SDK zip file.  It comprises everything you need to work with Ext JS, including documentation,  resources, and examples.  Let's briefly go through the directories shown in the screenshot.  Chapter 1  File folder adapter  docs examples  pkgs  resources src test ext.jsb2  ext-all.js  *other  Description Contains the ext-base.js file used to provide browser-independent  base-level DOM and AJAX functions for use by the main Ext JS  library. It also contains adapter files that allow you to work with other  JavaScript libraries, including jQuery, Dojo, and YUI. Documentation for the library. Individual component and combination examples. This is a veritable  treasure trove of information and working solutions to be integrated  into Oracle APEX. Assembled subsets of the JavaScript library, designed to assist building  customized versions of Ext JS.  Images, CSS files, and Flash objects used by Ext JS. JavaScript source code for Ext JS. Test cases used by Sencha for automated testing harness. Control file used to merge JavaScript files from src into pkgs files,  and also ext-all.js and ext-all-debug.js. Merged files  have the comments stripped and code minified. Merged files with  the -debug suffix are a non-compressed version, preferred during  development so that debugging is easier. Full Ext JS library, excluding the adapter, compressed and minified.  The uncompressed version without comments, ext-all-debug.js,  is useful for debugging during development. The uncompressed with  comments version is ext-all-debug-w-comments.js. Other files not described: index.html, gpl-3.0.txt, INCLUDE_ ORDER.txt, license.txt, and so on.  As you can see from the relative sizes of the folders, the Ext JS SDK has placed an  emphasis on documentation and examples. This greatly assists in learning to use the  library and is a real credit to the Ext JS developers.  The ext-all.js file and the adapter and resources folders are the only files you  need to deploy to your production web server. While saying this, my preference is to  deploy the entire SDK. That way all the documentation and examples are on hand.  [ 15 ]    Chapter 1  It allows your server administrator to secure the Oracle APEX directories, preventing  anyone from making changes to the standard Application Builder configuration.  Similarly, your application directory can be accessed only by the necessary people.  Customizing application builder files If you ever have the need to modify some of the CSS rules or JavaScript provided by  Oracle, here is one way to do it. By copying the Oracle APEX directories from the  i   location to your  ux  location, you can customize the standard Application Builder  files without impacting anyone else.    To use your customized version, you need to update the application preferences  image prefix to point to your alias, as shown in the following screenshot. To edit  application properties, log into Oracle Application Express, and then select the  appropriate application from the Application Builder. Click the Edit Application  Properties button, top right on the Application Definition page.  Oracle HTTP Server The Oracle HTTP Server  OHS  is the most mature of the three web server options  available, and is the typical choice for Oracle APEX production and development  environments today. OHS is based on the proven Apache web server, with the  Apache code base dependant on which version of the database you are using. Oracle  HTTP Server, distributed with Oracle Database 11g, uses the Apache 2.2 code base;  on the other hand, Oracle Application Server 10g is based on Apache 1.3 or Apache  2.0 for the standalone version.  [ 17 ]                Chapter 1  The message here is Oracle doesn't recommend you to install the version that comes  with the database. If you're going to install the standalone version of OHS, take the  extra step of downloading the version that comes packaged with the Application  Server. This is because the main versions of OHS are built for the Application Server  releases. OHS can be downloaded from http:  www.oracle.com technetwork  middleware ias index-091236.html.  Loading Ext JS onto the Oracle HTTP Server Depending on the version of the Oracle HTTP Server you are running, the location  for the Application Builder images directory is held in either the httpd.conf,  marvel.conf or dads.conf files. Search for the text alias  i .  For example:  Alias  i   "ORACLE_HTTPSERVER_HOME Apache images " Alias  ux  "ORACLE_HTTPSERVER_HOME Apache ux "  Here, ORACLE_HTTPSERVER_HOME is the location where the HTTP Server is installed.  Edit the file, adding another Alias  ux  as shown in the preceding snippet,  pointing to the location where you will upload the Ext JS files. Having done this,  upload the Ext JS files onto the web server at the location you specified. Remember,  you can either deploy all the files in the Ext SDK, or just the minimal set comprising  the ext-all.js file and the adapter and resources folders.  You will need to stop and restart the Oracle HTTP Server before your changes are  detected, which is done using the opmnctl executable.   For Unix and Linux, execute the following:  ORACLE_HTTPSERVER_HOME opmn bin opmnctl stopproc ias-component=HTTP_ Server ORACLE_HTTPSERVER_HOME opmn bin opmnctl startproc ias-component=HTTP_ Server  For Windows, execute the following:  ORACLE_HTTPSERVER_HOME\opmn\bin\opmnctl stopproc ias-component=HTTP_ Server ORACLE_HTTPSERVER_HOME\opmn\bin\opmnctl startproc ias-component=HTTP_ Server  [ 19 ]   Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment  To verify that the Ext JS library is now accessible on the web server, just check that  you can successfully fetch one of the files. Substituting the appropriate host and port  values, use your browser to verify you can now see the Ext JS asset:  http:  host:port ux ext-3.3.1 resources images default tree drop-yes. gif should show a tick, as seen in the following screenshot:   If you decide to do the full Ext JS SDK install, now is a good time to bookmark the  documentation and samples:   	 http:  host:port ux ext-3.3.1 docs index.html  	 http:  host:port ux ext-3.3.1 examples index.html  Embedded PL SQL Gateway The Embedded PL SQL Gateway  EPG  runs within the database as part of the  XML DB HTTP Protocol listener and provides equivalent core features to the Oracle  HTTP Server  OHS . The EPG works only in Oracle XE, and Oracle Database 11g and  greater. If you are going to use Oracle APEX on 10g editions of the database, you will  need to use the OHS or APEX Listener, as the EPG is not supported for any version  below 11g.  Because the EPG runs entirely within the 11g database, and it comes pre-installed   but not pre-configured , it is simple to maintain. As it is not possible to separate  the XML DB HTTP listener from the database, Oracle recommends not using it for  internet-based applications, due to the potential security risk when exposing the  database server directly to the Internet.  A number of other limitations exist for EPG when compared with Oracle HTTP  Server, including features such as dynamic HTML caching, system monitoring, and  logging in the Common Log Format.  The EPG is an appropriate solution for setting up APEX quickly for a proof of  concept approach, development environments, or for low-volume intranet-based  applications. EPG is an easy and convenient setup, but this comes at the price   of flexibility and performance. It should not be considered for serious   production environments.  [ 20 ]    Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment   	 Statement 1 sets the FTP port to 2100.   	 Statement 2 forces the database to reregister with the listener immediately.  	 Statement 3 verifies the port has been changed successfully.  You should now be able to log in via FTP. For the time being, it's easier to log in as  SYSTEM. There are many FTP tools available, so it's just a matter of choosing one  based on personal preference. In my case, I'm using the free FileZilla client, available  from http:  filezilla-project.org , in both Windows and Linux versions.  If you're using XE, you should see something similar to what's shown in the  following screenshot:  Create a new folder named  ux  in the XML DB repository, and then upload the   Ext JS files into this folder. Remember, you can either deploy all the files in the   Ext SDK, or just the minimal set comprising the ext-all.js file and adapter   and resources folders.  [ 22 ]    Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment  HTTP compression makes better use of network bandwidth by compressing data  on the server before sending it to the client. This allows content to be sent over the  network in a more compact form and can result in a dramatic reduction in download  time, reducing latency in your application and an improved user experience. Given the enhanced functionality it offers over mod_plsql, the Oracle APEX listener  will eventually become the preferred listener for Oracle APEX. However, in the short  term, most production systems will continue to use Oracle HTTP Server with mod_ plsql, until the new listener has been proven by early adopter sites.  Loading Ext JS for the Oracle APEX listener Once you have installed your choice of web server, the Oracle APEX Listener, and  uploaded the APEX images using the Oracle Installation Guide, you can load Ext JS.  The process for loading Ext JS is similar for each of the referenced web server options   Oracle WebLogic, and OC4J, and Oracle Glassfish . The instructions here are for  Oracle Glassfish.  You can deploy directly to a physical directory on the web server:   1.  Create a folder named ux in GLASSFISH_DIRECTORY domains DOMAIN_NAME   2.  Copy the Ext JS files to GLASSFISH_DIRECTORY domains DOMAIN_NAME   docroot.   docroot ux.   Or to a virtual directory on the web server:  1.  Copy the Ext JS files to the web server, for example C:\playpen\web\ux. 2.   In the GlassFish Admin Console, expand Configuration  Virtual Servers.  Select server, then scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Add Property  button. Enter alternatedocroot_1 in the Name field, and from= ux *  dir=C: playpen web  in the Value field, as shown in the next screenshot.  This will map the URL http:  hostname:port ux  to the physical directory  C: playpen web ux .  [ 24 ]   Remember that you can either deploy all the files in the Ext SDK, or just the minimal  set comprising the ext-all.js file and the adapter and resources folders. When  adding a virtual directory alias, you may need to restart the web server before the  alias is recognized.  Chapter 1  To verify that the Ext JS library is now accessible on the web server, just check that  you can successfully fetch one of the files. Substituting the appropriate host and port  values, use your browser to verify you can now see the Ext JS assets:  http:  host:port ux ext-3.3.1 resources images default tree drop-yes. gif should show a tick, as seen in the preceding screenshot.  Overviewing the production setup Consider the architecture diagram in the next screenshot:  [ 25 ]   Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment  The diagram is a well-known and generally accepted Internet-Firewall-DMZ- Firewall-Intranet architecture and shows the following zones:    	 External internet, outside the DMZ firewall  	 External web server tier acting as a reverse proxy between the DMZ firewall   and the Intranet firewall   	 Corporate intranet behind the Intranet firewall  If your Oracle APEX instance is going to be used only for Intranet applications,   we need to consider only the corporate intranet component on the right-hand   side of the diagram. This is the basic configuration documented earlier for the   Oracle HTTP server.  For Internet-accessible applications, security becomes a much more important factor.  Various high-profile hacking attacks have proven that web security is one of the most  critical issues facing any business that conducts its operations online. Compared to  intranet-only applications, internet-accessible applications have far larger numbers  of potential hackers.  Firewalls are configured to allow only specific types of access  HTTP HTTPS . In  DMZ architectures, firewalls are used to restrict the flow of network data so that  all inbound traffic from the internet and outbound traffic from the intranet must  be processed by web servers acting as proxy servers in the DMZ zone. By using a  reverse proxy server, such as Oracle Web Cache or HTTP Server in tandem with  internal and external firewalls, you can greatly reduce the risk of exposing your  backend data resources.   So what exactly does a reverse proxy do? When a client sends a request to your  website, the request goes to the proxy server. The proxy forwards the client's request  through a specific path in the intranet firewall to the content web server. The content  web server processes the request, passing the result back through the path to the  proxy. The proxy server sends the information to the client, rewriting any URLs as  though it was the actual content server.  Reverse proxies can be additionally configured to perform extra tasks such as  compressing files to optimize network traffic, or facilitating secure transmission  of information utilizing Secure Socket Layers  SSL , to provide an encrypted  connection between the proxy server and the client.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 1  Using Ext JS in a hosted APEX  environment Oracle APEX is designed to support hosted development, where the only access  you have to your workspace is via a browser. The Application Builder and SQL  Workshop contain all the necessary functionality to build an application from scratch  without any other tools.  Typically in a hosted environment such as http:  apex.oracle.com, you don't  have access to the web server to upload the Ext JS files. In this situation, you can take  advantage of Ext partnering with CacheFly, a global content network, to provide free  CDN hosting for the Ext JS framework. A Content Delivery Network  CDN  is a collection of web servers distributed   across multiple locations to deliver content more efficiently to users. The server  selected for delivering content to a specific user is typically based on a measure of  network proximity.  For example, the server with the fewest network hops or the server with the  quickest response time is chosen; that is, using a CDN to deliver static content, such  as Ext JavaScript, CSS, and images will result in your pages getting downloaded  significantly faster.  In the hosted environment, you don't load the Ext files onto the server, instead  simply reference the Ext content in your Oracle APEX page templates from the  CacheFly site. The following code will be added to Oracle APEX page templates:  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="http:  extjs.cachefly. net ext-3.3.1 resources css ext-all.css"  > <script type="text javascript" src="http:  extjs.cachefly.net ext- 3.3.1 adapter ext ext-base.js">   <script type="text javascript" src="http:  extjs.cachefly.net ext- 3.3.1 ext-all.js">   We will look at page templates and how to integrate Ext JS content in greater detail  in Chapter 3, Building an Ext Theme into APEX.  Installing a source code repository One of the very first tasks you should do in any software project, even before you  write a single line of code, is to install a source code repository. This is where the  development team keeps all of its code in a centralized location, using version  control software to track and manage changes to files over time.  [ 27 ]   Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment  Version control systems are appealing to developers because they back up source  code and keep track of changes. So when a new code version introduces a bug, it's  easy to compare with earlier versions using text differencing tools to highlight what's  changed and identify the problem.  Managers like version control systems because it helps prevent loss of data, and  provides tagging capabilities for releases making it very easy to check a production  version for error correction without disrupting the current development version.  I'll be discussing Subversion  http:  subversion.apache.org   in this book, so  if you're already using another version control system, the same principles apply,  although the solution might be a little different. Subversion  SVN  has rapidly become the de facto standard free open source  version control system today. Binary versions of SVN are available for all major  operation systems. Installation of the SVN server is very much dependent on the  operating system, so refer to the installation instructions for your operating system.  VisualSVN Server  http:  visualsvn.com server   is an excellent free solution  for the Windows systems, and with a one-click installation, you really can't get an  any simpler setup. There are a number of third-party clients available; TortoiseSVN  is a popular choice on Windows, as it is integrated directly into Windows Explorer.   For batch programming, you will need to use a SVN command-line client, such as  CollabNets' version  http:  www.open.collab.net downloads subversion  .  Subversion's integrations into various IDEs are also common, including JDeveloper,  SQL Developer, TOAD, and Apanta.       [ 28 ]   Chapter 1  The previous screenshot shows the VisualSVN Server, containing a single repository  named apex-solutions, with two projects named jquery and playpen respectively.  The playpen project is used for this book, and contains a standard recommended  layout: the trunk directory to hold the "main line" of development, a branches  directory to contain branch copies, and a tags directory to contain tag copies.  The question of what to store in SVN is also partly answered in the screenshot we  just saw. The short and simple answer is "everything to do with the project". You  can use the example of a new developer starting on the project as a litmus test.  Given a virgin machine, they should be able to do a single checkout, and be able to  do a full build of the system. You may make exceptions for things that are large, or  complicated to install and stable, for example, the database and IDE tools, such as  JDeveloper or SQL Developer.  Here is a basic list of some of the types of files you would typically want to store in  your code repository for an Oracle APEX application:   	 Database object scripts: Everything you use to define your application   in the database. This includes a current Oracle Initialization Parameter   init.ora  file, scripts to create your users, tables, views, packages,  procedures, functions, and so on. If your application isn't too large,   you could also include database schema exports to ensure you include  absolutely everything.   	 APEX application and related files: You can export and import your   application definitions, including workspace users, application, CSS, images,  files, themes, and user interface defaults stored in Oracle APEX. These  exports provide a complete snapshot of your APEX application, allowing you  to deploy it to another environment, or restore your application to an earlier  state. The export files also allow you to recover individual components.   	 Web server assets: Your Ext JS files, application JavaScript, CSS, images, and   so on, and all configuration files for your web server.   	 Documentation: Project management documentation, as well as the user   help and administration documentation.   	 Utilities and command scripts: This is a catch-all for scripts that don't fit into   any of the previous categories. Examples include scripts used to export and  import the application, to stop and start processes, FTP files to web servers,  deploying the application to other environments, and so on.  [ 29 ]   Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment  Automating the build process Version control systems commonly provide command line interfaces, providing   you the opportunity to automate source control tasks you regularly perform using  batch files.   One of the tasks you'll want to do on a regular basis is to back up and check in your  APEX application into Subversion.  Oracle has provided a Java utility named APEXExport that allows you to export  Oracle APEX applications from the command line, without requiring a manual  export via the web interface. We'll go through how to set up your Subversion  repository to support a fully automated backup process.  Once again, I will provide instructions for a Windows environment, but because  APEXExport is a Java utility, minor adaptations to the instructions will allow you to  run it in a Linux Unix environment.  Configuring and using APEXExport In the root of the Oracle APEX installation files, you will find a utilities folder  containing a readme.txt file. The file provides detailed instructions on how to set up  and use the APEXExport utility. Pre-requites for the utility include installation of the Java Development Kit  JDK  of  version 1.5 or greater, and the inclusion of classes12.jar in the CLASSPATH.   I wrote earlier that we should store "everything to do with the project" in our SVN  repository, so that with a single checkout we could do a full build of the system.   Also raised was the possibility of exceptions to this rule for things that are large,   or complicated to install and stable, for example, the database and IDE tools such   as JDeveloper.   Let's make an exception by assuming the JDK is already installed on your  computer— either as a standalone installation, or as part of an IDE for example in  SQL Developer or JDeveloper. If you didn't want to make this exception, add SQL  Developer  which includes the JDK  into your SVN repository.  The classes12.jar file is the Oracle JDBC library for Oracle database 10g, found  in the %ORACLE_HOME%\jdbc\lib directory. For Oracle database 11g, the equivalent  file is ojdbc5.jar for Java 5 or ojdbc6.jar for Java 6. Generally for Oracle database  11g, you should use ojdbc6.jar.  [ 30 ]   Chapter 1  Because developers may have very different setups on their computers, even within  a small team, the easiest way to manage the location of the JDBC library is by using  the Oracle Instant Client. The Instant Client allows you to run your applications  without the standard Oracle client, and includes additional libraries for SQL*Plus.  Instant Client comes in two versions—Basic and Basic Lite. Both versions are suitable  for Oracle APEX: Basic Lite is a smaller version of the Basic, with only English error  messages and supporting only specific character sets, including AL32UTF8, used by  Oracle APEX. Installation is simply extracting the Instant Client files into a directory.  Download a copy of Instant Client for your database version and operating system from  http:  www.oracle.com technology tech oci instantclient index.html. Also download the SQL*Plus Instant Client, which is installed by extracting it into  the same directory as the Instant Client.  Before we go any further, let's take a look at the intended layout of the   SVN repository.  [ 31 ]    Next, we set the CLASS_PATH to our JDBC drivers and export utilities. I'm using the  Oracle JDBC library for Oracle database 11g, with the equivalent Oracle 10g version  commented out.  Chapter 1  cd  d %BASE%\database\apex  REM Make sure our local copy is up to date if not  "%SVN_HOME%"  ==    "%SVN_HOME%"\svn update  We change folders, as the APEXExport utility exports files into the current   working directory.  Before running the export, we update our repository, refreshing the current  directory and subdirectories using the command-line version of SVN. In this case,  I'm referencing an externally defined environment variable SVN_HOME to identify the  home directory of the SVN command line client. SVN_HOME is usually defined as a  Windows environment variable when the SVN command line client is installed.  Using conditional logic, allows this step to be skipped if the variable has not been set  for your computer.  java oracle.apex.APEXExport -db mark-pc:1521:XE -user playpen  -password playpen -workspaceid 1038420889063720 -skipExportDate  APEXExport allows you to either export an individual application, a workspace,  or the entire Oracle APEX instance. The utility is run through Java using a JDBC  connection to the database; for complete syntax details refer to the readme.txt file  included in the utilities folder.   In this batch script here, I am exporting a workspace. To find out the workspace ID  for your environment, you can run the following query in SQL Workshop within  Oracle APEX:  select v 'WORKSPACE_ID'  from dual  Exporting a workspace will create a separate script for each application in your  workspace. So for application 150, a file named f150.sql will be created.  REM Check if SVN_HOME has been set if  "%SVN_HOME%"  ==    goto :no_svn_home  "%SVN_HOME%"\svn add *.sql --force "%SVN_HOME%"\svn commit -m "Automated backup and check in."  goto exit  :no_svn_home  [ 33 ]   Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment  echo ERROR echo ERROR: SVN_HOME environment variable is not set, no automated SVN  check in. echo ERROR  goto exit  :exit endlocal  Once the APEX application exports have completed, we check the export files into  SVN. We start by seeing if the SVN_HOME environment variable is set; if not, skipping  the check-in and raising an error message. If set, the svn add command is used to  ensure that when any new applications are added to the repository, then the svn  commit command is executed, with a required check-in message.   SVN detects whether or not files have been modified as part of the check-in process,  so if no changes have been made to an application, it won't be checked in. The  following screenshot shows the output of the batch script, where five applications are  exported from the database, but only one had been modified, so only that application  was transmitted to the SVN repository.  Now that we have our batch script set up, the last step is to schedule the script to  be run automatically every day. Ideally, this would be configured to run on the  SVN server; however, you could run the script from team members' computers,  because as we've just seen in the previous screenshot, only modified applications are  committed to the SVN repository.  [ 34 ]     Chapter 1  Summary In this chapter we've discussed the merits of the different web server options  available for Oracle APEX, covering the Oracle HTTP Server, the Embedded PL SQL  gateway, and the Oracle APEX Listener. Installation of the Ext JS library into each  of these environments, including using Ext JS in a hosted APEX environment where  you don't have access to the web server, has also been covered.  In setting up for success, we discussed the importance of taking a little extra time at  the beginning of a project to set up a productive development environment. To aid  the development process, we set up a SVN source code repository and included some  tools to allow the automated backup and commit of an Oracle APEX workspace to the  repository. A number of other automation opportunities were also discussed.  Let's now start to get acquainted with the Ext JS library, looking at some of the  functionality it provides for manipulating the Document Object Model  DOM .  [ 37 ]    Getting Acquainted with Ext  In this chapter we will be familiarizing ourselves with some of the functionality the  Ext JS library provides for manipulating the Document Object Model.  The Document Object Model  DOM  is an API that provides a structural  representation of a HTML document. This allows developers to manipulate web  pages using the properties, methods, and events exposed by the DOM. Manipulation  of DOM elements is one of the basic staple tasks that almost every JavaScript code  will do.  Ext JS provides a library of methods that allow you to do cross-browser DOM  manipulation, allowing you to focus on adding business functionality, rather than  having to build separate solutions for different browsers.  This chapter explores some of the functionality Ext JS provides, with topics including:   	 Building a sandbox for standalone testing  	 Cross-browser DOM manipulation and traversal  	 Sizing and positioning elements  	 CSS classes and styling  	 Defining event handlers  	 Parameter passing using object notation    	 Using namespacing to avoid collisions  Building a sandbox Before attempting to integrate Ext JS and APEX, it's good practice to develop your  interface design using a prototyping approach. This allows for the exploration  of features and functions in isolation, to explore a design approach without the  temptation of building the final solution at the first try.    Chapter 2                         This code contains the minimum requirements for a page to use Ext JS, the source  located in chapter02\Example 2.1.html of the example code for the book. To use  Ext JS, we need to include references to the following files, and the files must be in the  include order listed:   	 ext-all.css: This is the main Ext CSS file that controls the look and feel  for the Ext framework and widgets. Rather than making modifications to  this file to customize or make adjustments to the CSS, you should include a  separate "application" CSS file. When using an application CSS file, it should  be included after the ext-all.css file and before any JavaScript files. When  determining which CSS rule is applied by the browser, two factors are  considered—CSS specificity and order. When two CSS rules have the same  specificity, the last rule is applied.   	 ext-base.js: This provides an adapter layer of base-level functionality for  DOM manipulation, event handling animation, and so on. Prior to version  1.1, Ext required the use of one of the following base libraries: YUI, jQuery,  or Prototype. By creating adapters for each of the external libraries, Ext  maintained a separation of concerns, allowing developers to choose which  external library to use. Beginning with Ext version 1.1, Ext included its own  native Ext adapter, so external libraries are no longer required.   	 ext-all.js: This contains the entire JavaScript for all of the Ext components   and widgets. When developing, it's easiest to include ext-all.js or   ext-all-debug.js, which is an uncompressed, unminified version better   for debugging. Not all sites require the full Ext library, so cut-down  versions can be assembled by including just the components being used.  This is discussed further under performance considerations in Chapter 11,  Performance Tuning your JavaScript.   Similarly to include application CSS files after the ext-all.css, you should include  your application JavaScript files. When two JavaScript functions have the same  specification signature, the last version of the function is the one called.   [ 41 ]   Getting Acquainted with Ext  So, if you haven't already done so, open the chapter02\Example 2.1.html in  Firefox, start Firebug, and type the following command into the console:  Ext.Msg.alert 'Hello World', 'Ext JS is very cool!' ;  Provided your include paths are correct, you should see a modal alert that prevents  you from interacting with the rest of the page until the alert is closed, similar to that  shown in the following screenshot. If not, you probably have an error message Ext is  not defined; adjust your include path to reference the Ext JS library files correctly.   [ 42 ]   In fact, you're not really looking at a modal alert, despite your being able to move it  around within the browser window, and it behaving like one. It's really just a bunch  of HTML tags combined with CSS and some JavaScript events. If you switch to the  HTML tab in Firebug, you will see something similar to the following screenshot:   Chapter 2  Remember, our page originally had no HTML within the body. Everything you see  in the previous screenshot has been created dynamically using JavaScript and our  call to Ext.Msg.alert. Imagine coming up with the CSS and JavaScript to do this  yourself! This is a small glimpse at why Ext JS is very cool!  [ 43 ]   Getting Acquainted with Ext  Cross-browser DOM manipulation with  Ext.Element One of the great challenges facing web developers when writing JavaScript is  the lack of consistency in how the Document Object Model  DOM  has been  implemented by the different software vendors. The World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  was founded in 1994 to promote open  standards for the Internet, publishing standards for browser scripting languages   ECMAScript  in 1997, and a standardized DOM in 1998. Today, browsers have  varying levels of conformance to the current DOM Level 3 specification published by  the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  in 2004.  To allow for many differences between different browser implementations, Ext  provides the Ext.Element class, which encapsulates a DOM element and provides  cross-browser simple DOM manipulation methods.  Open chapter02\Example 2.2.html in Firefox, which includes all of the content of  the earlier Example 2.1.html, along with the following styles and body content:               ...               ...          .box {              border: 1px solid c0c0c0;              padding: 5px;          }           .ux-selected {              background-color: dfe8f6;              border-color: a3bae9;          }               ...                                      one             two             three             four   [ 44 ]   Chapter 2             five             six             seven             eight                  Ext provides the Ext.get method  shorthand for Ext.Element.get  to retrieve any  element as an Ext.Element. Let's see it in action, running the following commands in  the Firebug Console:  var el = Ext.get 'test' ; console.dir el ;  [ 45 ]     Getting Acquainted with Ext  Center the test element in the middle of the page:  Ext.fly 'test' .center  ;  Move the test element to a specific location at x=100, y=50 using animation:  Ext.fly 'test' .setLocation 100,50,true ;  Hide the test element:  Ext.fly 'test' .hide  ;  Show the test element, with some animation:  Ext.fly 'test' .show true ;  Relocate the test element to its original position:  Ext.fly 'test' .clearPositioning  ;  As you can see, it's very easy to manipulate the size and positioning of DOM  elements using Ext.Element. We haven't explored all the features here, but if you  refer to the Ext.Element documentation at http:  dev.sencha.com deploy dev  docs ?class=Ext.Element, you will find comprehensive methods for getting and  setting the margin, border, padding, and position of an element.   CSS classes and styling Ext.Element also has a set of methods for manipulating DOM elements using CSS  classes and styles, allowing you to query, add, remove, and replace classes and  styles. Let's try a few.  First, refresh your page, and resize and center the test div:  Ext.fly 'test' .setWidth 400 ; Ext.fly 'test' .center  ;  To add a class to an element:  Ext.fly 'el-5' .addClass 'ux-selected' ;  [ 48 ]   Your page should look like the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  To remove a class:  Ext.fly 'el-5' .removeClass 'ux-selected' ;  To alternately add and remove a class, you can toggle it:  Ext.fly 'el-5' .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;  To "stripe" the test elements' child elements so each alternate row is highlighted, and   toggle the striping effect on and off:  Ext.fly 'test' .select 'div:even' .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;  [ 49 ]   Getting Acquainted with Ext  The result is shown in the following screenshot:  To add a class to one element, and remove the same class from all siblings:  Ext.fly 'el-5' .radioClass 'ux-selected' ;  Methods also exist for styles, for example:  Ext.fly 'el-5' .setStyle 'border', '1px solid FF0000' ;  DOM traversal In order to be able to navigate around the DOM tree from any given position,  traversing both up and down the DOM in a browser, Ext provides a traversal   API using CSS selectors to locate elements. Ext supports most of the CSS3   selectors, along with custom selectors and basic XPath. For a complete list of  supported selectors, refer to the Ext API documentation for Ext.DomQuery at  http:  dev.sencha.com deploy dev docs ?class=Ext.DomQuery.  Open chapter02\Example 2.3.html, which includes all of the content of the earlier  Example 2.2.html, along with the body containing additional HTML markup for  an unordered list and a paragraph  ul and p elements .                                  one             two             three             four             five                                    5.1                     5.2                     5.3   [ 50 ]   Chapter 2                     5.4                                 a paragraph                         six             seven             eight                Using the Firebug console once again, let's try some of the DOM traversal methods  available in Ext.Element.  Let's toggle a class for the first and last child elements of foo:  Ext.fly 'foo' .first  .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ; Ext.fly 'foo' .last  .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;  The result is shown in the following screenshot:  Passing a selector filters for that selector:     no selector the toggles the list Ext.fly 'el-5' .first  .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;     using a selector, the paragraph is toggled instead Ext.fly 'el-5' .first ‘p’ .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;  [ 51 ]   Getting Acquainted with Ext  To return the first child at any depth below the current element based on a passed in  selector, we use the child method; whereas for the first direct child  1 level down ,  we use the down method:     child method finds the first list item Ext.fly 'el-5' .child 'li' .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;     down method does not find the first list item Ext.fly 'el-5' .down 'li' .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;  Navigating between siblings is done using the next and prev methods; once again  you can optionally pass selectors to filter for that selector:     toggle previous sibling Ext.fly 'el-5' .prev  .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;     toggle next sibling Ext.fly 'el-5' .next  .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;     toggle next sibling that is a div with class "pickme"     does not exist in the example file!! Ext.fly 'el-5' .next 'div.pickme' .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;  Traversing up the DOM path is just as easy using up and parent methods, which  provide similar functionality but accept different parameters.   To select the immediate parent:  var el = Ext.get 'foo' .first  ; el.parent  .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;  Walking up the DOM, looking for a parent that matches the passed simple selector:     up  String selector, [Number Mixed maxDepth]   el.up 'div.box' .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;  This is equivalent to:     parent  [String selector], [Boolean returnDom]    el.parent 'div.box' .toggleClass 'ux-selected' ;  Selecting multiple elements In our DOM traversal examples so far, we have fetched only a single element to  manipulate. More often than not, we are going to be more interested in interacting  with multiple elements, which is where Ext.select and Ext.query come into play.  [ 52 ]    Getting Acquainted with Ext  Reworking our previous example to use Ext.query:  function doSomething   {   this.highlight  ; }  var els = Ext.query 'div','test' ; Ext.each els,function el  {        el is a DOM node here     Ext.get el .on 'click',doSomething ;     console.log el.id ; } ;  DOM manipulation Ext provides a strong API to allow us to add, modify, and remove elements in the  DOM easily. We will be using chapter02\Example 2.3.html to test the Ext API  once again.  Let's start by creating some DOM elements:  Ext.fly 'test' .createChild ' nine ' ; Ext.fly 'test' .createChild {tag:'div',id:'el-10', html:'ten'} ;  Here, we used the Ext.Element.createChild method to create and append two div  elements to the test element, each containing a text string. For the first div, we simply  passed the HTML to include. The second example shows an alternative method  using a Ext.DomHelper config, which provides an abstraction of the DOM allowing  you to build up complex HTML fragments programmatically before applying them  to the DOM.  When using Ext.Element.createChild, an Ext.Element is returned, allowing you  to do additional processing:  var el = Ext.fly 'test' .createChild {tag:'div', html:'eleven'} ;  el.addClass 'ux-selected' ; console.log el.id ;  [ 54 ]   In this example, an id for the div tag wasn't specified, instead Ext.Element,  returned to the el variable, was used for additional processing. Take a moment to  inspect the new div using the Firebug HTML inspector. You should see the div tag  has automatically been assigned an id, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 2              Adding of elements relative to an existing DOM node is done using insertHTML,  insertSibling, or using convenience methods insertBefore, insertAfter,  insertFirst. Refresh the page, and let's try a few.  Before we do, refresh the page and run the following code to add a border and some  space around the div elements within the test dev:     add styling to existing div elements Ext.fly 'test' .select 'div'    .setStyle 'border','1px solid c0c0c0'    .setStyle 'margin','2px' ;  [ 55 ]   Getting Acquainted with Ext  Run the following code:     create a reusable template for text substitution var html = '&nbsp; {text} &nbsp;'; var tpl = new Ext.DomHelper.createTemplate html ;     show insertHtml placement options var el = Ext.get 'el-4' ; el.insertHtml 'beforeBegin',tpl.apply {text:'beforeBegin'}  ; el.insertHtml 'afterBegin' ,tpl.apply {text:'afterBegin'}  ; el.insertHtml 'beforeEnd'  ,tpl.apply {text:'beforeEnd'}  ; el.insertHtml 'afterEnd'   ,tpl.apply {text:'afterEnd'}  ;     show insertSibling placement options var obj = Ext.get 'el-7' ; obj.insertSibling tpl.apply {text: 'before Sib'} , 'before' ; obj.insertSibling tpl.apply {text: 'after Sib'} , 'after' ;  The result is shown in the following screenshot:  Notice the use of Ext.DomHelper.createTemplate in the code; it's something not  previously mentioned. An Ext.Template defines a fragment of HTML code with  some embedded placeholder tags, allowing you to substitute values quickly and  easily. This is done repeatedly further down in the code using the apply method,  which returns the HTML fragment with the substituted values.  [ 56 ]    Getting Acquainted with Ext  This special mark-up is used throughout Ext when box wrapping elements.  Examples of elements using it include the Ext.Button, Ext.Panel when attribute  frame=true is set, and Ext.Window. To see this in action, run the following code:  Ext.get "el-5" .boxWrap  ; Ext.get "foo" .boxWrap  .addClass "x-box-blue" ;   This screenshot shows the expected output, where el-5 has been wrapped with the  default gray container, and a four-way shadow. Element foo has been wrapped, and  a class x-box-blue has been applied to the wrapper, resulting in a blue container.  The x-box-blue CSS rules are included with Ext; to use an alternate class, you would  need to provide the necessary CSS rules also.  Defining event handlers Event-driven programming is supported in web browsers through the use of  JavaScript to register event handlers and listeners on page elements in the DOM tree.  Event handlers provide a mechanism to make a HTML page interactive, so when  you click on page elements, or hover over something, JavaScript is executed, and the  appearance or behavior of the page changes. Historically, developers used the Inline model to add event handlers directly to an  element as an attribute of the element:   Click me<  div>  [ 58 ]   Or developers also used the Traditional model to add event handlers via scripts,   for example:   Chapter 2   Click me     var dom = document.getElementById 'test' ; dom.onclick = function    {     alert this.id + ' was clicked' ;  };    This event-handling model is known as DOM Level 0, and allows only a single  event handler for each event to be attached to a DOM node.  The W3C designed a more flexible event handling model in DOM Level 2, to  allow multiple events to be attached to a DOM node and uses methods including  addEventListener, removeEventListener, and dispatchEvent. Unfortunately,  Microsoft does not follow the W3C model, instead uses their own model using  methods including attachEvent, detachEvent, and fireEvent, to provide similar  functionality.  Ext removes the need to deal with different browser event models by wrapping the  browser's native event-object into Ext.EventObject, to provide normalized event  processing, freeing us from dealing with cross-browser differences.   Let's take a look at the ExtEventObject API. Open chapter02\Example 2.4.html,  which includes all of the content of the earlier Example 2.3.html, with some  additional formatting added to the div elements, and a new messages region  included above, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 59 ]   Getting Acquainted with Ext  To add an event handler or listener to an element, we use the addListener method,  or preferably use the on method, which is shorthand for addListener:  function handleClick e, t {      e.preventDefault  ;     var target = Ext.get t ;     target.highlight  ;          var msg = Ext.get 'msg-ct' ;     msg.update 'You clicked ' + target.id +          ', with innerHtml ' + target.dom.innerHTML ;     msg.highlight  ; }     add a click event to div el-6 Ext.fly 'el-6' .on 'click',handleClick ;  In this example, we added an event handler for a mouse-click event on a specific  DOM element, el-6, to execute an action handler function handleClick.   The handleClick function accepts two parameters: e, which is an Ext.EventObject,  and t, the DOM element that was the target of the event. Our handleClick function  is used here to highlight the target element and update the messages region with  information about the target element and highlight the messages region.   The preventDefault method is used to prevent the default handling of the event by  a browser. It's not really necessary here, but if we had attached an event to a DOM  link, it would prevent the browser opening the link address.  Alternate syntaxes for adding the event handler:  Ext.EventManager.on "el-6", 'click', handleClick ; Ext.EventManager.addListener "el-6", 'click', handleClick ;  To remove an event handler, we use the removeListener method, or the shorthand  equivalent un method:  Ext.fly 'el-6' .removeListener 'click',handleClick ; Ext.fly 'el-6' .un 'click',handleClick ;  You must include a reference to the function passed in the addListener call. All  listeners attached to an element can be removed using removeAllListeners:  Ext.fly 'el-6' .removeAllListeners  ;  [ 60 ]   Chapter 2  Using event delegation to reduce memory  consumption Adding listeners to multiple elements can be done easily using CSS selectors:  Ext.select 'div:even','test' .on 'click',handleClick ;  However, before you do add multiple selectors, you may want to consider event  delegation. Rather than registering multiple event handlers for each element in  a group of elements, you can register an event to a container element and take  advantage of events bubbling up the DOM hierarchy.  So, in Example 2.4.html, our HTML looks like this:                     one             two             three             four             five                                    5.1                     5.2                     5.3                     5.4                                 a paragraph                         six             seven             eight           We could use event delegation as follows:  function handleClick e, t {      e.preventDefault  ;     var target = Ext.get t ;     target.highlight  ;          var msg = Ext.get 'msg-ct' ;     msg.update 'You clicked ' + target.id +          ', with innerHtml ' + target.dom.innerHTML ;     msg.highlight  ; }  [ 61 ]    The delay option fires the event after the delay period, but does not cancel events:     delay the handleClick for 1000ms  1 second  Ext.fly 'test' .on 'click',handleClick, this,{delay: 1000} ;  Chapter 2  Parameter passing using object notation Many of the APIs provided by Ext use a config object to pass configuration settings  to a JavaScript function. So what exactly is this config object, and why use it?   The config object is an object literal, which we will learn about shortly. We use it  because it's more flexible and is self documenting.  Old-school parameters Using old school JavaScript programming, a typical function looked like this:  function show_prompt title, message, width  {        code }  To call that code, you would write:  var answer = show_prompt 'my title','a short message', 300 ;  While this isn't too bad for this example, as a developer you have to call the   function passing parameters in the order specified, and you must pass all  parameters. In a few months time, an issue gets raised, and looking at the   function call you have absolutely no idea what 300 is about without digging   around to find the function definition.   Using object notation The new way of passing parameters is done using object literals, popularized by  Douglas Crockford as JSON  JavaScript Object Notation . Its structure is simple;  it is a comma separated list of properties wrapped in curly braces. Each property is  denoted by listing its name and value separated by a colon character.  Here is a complete example, using object literals:  var config = {    title: 'Contact details',    msg: 'Please enter your Name:',    width: 300,    buttons: Ext.MessageBox.OKCANCEL,  [ 63 ]    Use namespacing to avoid collisions Something you have to be aware of when doing JavaScript programming is  corruption of the global namespace. Every time you define a simple function, or other  variable at the top level of a web page, the names you've chosen could potentially  come in conflict with names used by other developers or libraries that you are using.  In the browser, all global variables become properties of the window object.  Chapter 2  So when you declare a variable:  var gDebug = false;  you're actually declaring:  var window.gDebug = false;  More often than not, modern web browser applications use one or more JavaScript  libraries, snippets of code from multiple sources, and code you've written as well. For  our environment, APEX includes jQuery, jQuery UI, and APEX JavaScript libraries,  and we've added Ext also. It's not safe to assume you can reference a variable or object  in the global namespace without impacting an existing variable or object.  [ 65 ]    Chapter 2  Ext.namespace Ext provides the Ext.namespace method  or the shorthand Ext.ns  which will  set up namespaces for you, including checking if the namespace already exists. For  example, to set up a namespace of Playpen and the packages regions and form:  Ext.namespace 'Playpen.regions', 'Playpen.form' ;   Then to define a new class, such as customerDetails within Playpen.regions:  Playpen.regions.customerDetails = new Ext.Panel {     allowDomMove : false,     applyTo: 'customerDetails',     animCollapse: false,     autoHeight: true,     ...     titleCollapse: true } ;  Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL Ext uses a 1x1 pixel transparent .gif image to create inline icons with CSS  background images, allowing Ext to size objects correctly in a cross-browser  compatible way. In older versions of IE, this defaults to http:  extjs.com s.gif,  which can cause issues if extjs.com is not accessible, or you're using SSL, which will  raise security warnings in browsers.   To prevent these issues, you need to set the Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL to a 1x1 pixel  transparent .gif image on your local web server. If you're using a standard APEX  install, you can reference:  Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL = ' i 1px_trans.gif';  This needs to be included in your page template directly after the Ext JavaScript files,  normally included in an external JavaScript file, but could be inline as follows:           Example 2.1            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"         href=".. .. extjs resources css ext-all.css"  >                 <script type="text javascript"                src=".. .. extjs adapter ext ext-base.js">  [ 67 ]   Getting Acquainted with Ext            <script type="text javascript"         src=".. .. extjs ext-all.js">                           Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL = ' i 1px_trans.gif';                    Summary In this chapter we have spent time familiarizing ourselves with some of the  underlying concepts and functionality Ext provides for manipulating the Document  Object Model  DOM .    By using simple standalone testing pages, we have done isolated testing without  worrying about interaction with APEX, or trying to build end solutions. Using the  Firebug Console, HTML, and DOM tabs, we have executed Ext code snippets and  inspected the results both in the browser and within Firebug.  We have investigated the Ext.Element component, exploring how it allows us to  easily manipulate and navigate the DOM. We have used CSS3 selectors provided  by Ext.DomQuery to retrieve elements of interest, and then modified them by using  the Ext.Element API to add and remove classes, attach event handlers, and add or  remove elements around them.   We have explored more advanced event techniques such as delegation and one-off  events, as well as modern JavaScript programming concepts such as object notation  and the need for namespacing variables.  Enough with the theory! Let's start building some APEX templates with Ext JS.  [ 68 ]   Building a Ext JS Theme   into APEX  This chapter starts our journey building a theme based application on Ext JS into  APEX. It provides a background on APEX themes and discusses how to create an  APEX theme from scratch. Instructions on how to integrate the Ext JS library into the  page template are provided, together with potential issues you may encounter.   This chapter includes:   	 An overview of APEX themes, explaining the template types that make up a  theme, as well as the benefits of separating the APEX engine, templates, and  application functionality from each other.   	 Starting out creating a APEX Theme.  	 Building a Page Template based on the Ext.Viewport component. This   covers the process of creating a template using a standalone prototype and  integrating it into an APEX page template.   	 Discussion on how JavaScript DOM manipulation can result in input items   appearing outside the form element, and the consequences that result. A  customized version of the Ext.Viewport is created to ensure that input items  always remain with the form.  Theme basics Out of the box, APEX comes with twenty themes, each theme comprising a collection  of templates used to define the layout and appearance of an entire application.  An application can have many themes, but only one theme is active at any time;  switching themes is done at design time only.   Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX  You can create custom themes, which may be published, either within a workspace  by a Workspace Manager or for the whole APEX instance by an Internal Workspace  Manager. Publishing a theme encourages consistency across applications.   A theme comprises nine template types: breadcrumb, button, calendar, label, list,  page, popup list of values, region, and report. A theme must have at least one of each  of the nine template types.  Within each template type are a set of predefined classes and eight custom classes.  For example, the label template has the following classes:  - Not Identified -   	  	 No Label  	 Optional Label  	 Optional Label with Help  	 Required Label  	 Required Label with Help  	 Custom 1... Custom 8  Programmers use these templates to construct the HTML pages that make up an  application. Each page is declaratively defined using metadata to select templates to  be used for the presentation.  The APEX engine dynamically renders an HTML page using the metadata,  assembling relevant templates and injecting dynamic data into placeholders within  the templates. The HTML page is viewed when you request a page through a web  browser. When you submit a page, the APEX engine performs page processing, once  again using declaratively defined metadata to perform computations, validations,  processes, and branching. This type of processing is a typical Model-View-Controller MVC  pattern, where  the view is the HTML generated using the application templates. The APEX engine  is the controller and receives the GET or POST input and decides what to do with it,  handing over to domain objects. The domain objects model is encapsulated in the page  definition and contains the business rules and functionality to carry out specific tasks.  Separation of concerns The MVC pattern also promotes another good design principle—separation of  concerns. APEX has been designed so that the APEX engine, templates, and the  application functionality can be optimized independently of each other.   [ 70 ]   Chapter 3  Clearly, the process of assembling and sequencing the steps necessary to render a  page, and process a page are important to the overall solution. By separating this  out and letting Oracle deal with the complexities of this through the APEX engine, it  allows programmers to concentrate on providing business functionality.  Equally, by separating presentation templates from the business logic, it allows each  aspect to be maintained separately. This provides a number of advantages including  ease of design change, allowing templates to be modified either by different people  or at different times to enhance the interface without breaking the application.   An excellent example of this is the standard themes provided in APEX, which have  been designed to be completely interchangeable. Switching standard themes is  simply a matter of loading a theme from the repository and then switching the active  theme. APEX then remaps components to the new active theme using the template  class identifiers.  Standard themes We will be building our own custom theme rather than using one of the twenty   pre-built ones. Nevertheless, it's worthwhile knowing what they provide, as we will  build our custom theme by using one of them as a "starter".  [ 71 ]   Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX  Looking at this image, we can see a preview of the standard APEX themes. Each  theme provides a similar interface, so really each standard theme is just a visual  variation on the others. The colors used are a little different, or the HTML layout is  tweaked slightly, but in reality they are all much the same.  Theme 4 is used by APEX as the "starter" theme and contains one template for each  template class for all the template types—a total of 69 templates. Theme 19 is also  worth noting as it's designed for mobile devices. Each of these themes are full of  good HTML practices and show how and where to use the substitution strings.  Creating a theme When creating a theme, you can choose to copy one from the repository, create  one from scratch or from an export file. The repository and export file options copy  the entire theme, and you start editing the template to suit. Creating a theme from  scratch creates a theme without any templates. You then need to define templates for  each different type before you can switch from the active theme.  In my opinion, the easiest way to build a new theme is to take the approach that the  application should always be in a working state, and the way to do this is to create a  new empty TEMPLATE application using a standard theme and build from there.  From this working base, you can progressively convert the templates to use Ext  functionality, building simple test pages as you go to verify the templates. These test  pages also form part of your template documentation, allowing team members to  examine and understand specific functionality in isolation.  Once a theme has templates for each of the nine template types, you can publish the  theme into the workspace to be used by your business applications.  The following screenshot shows a dialog named Create Workspace Theme from the  APEX wizard. Notice that you can change the theme number when you publish a  theme, providing a very simple mechanism for you to version control your themes.   [ 72 ]   Chapter 3  A published theme can't be edited directly once it has been created, but using a  TEMPLATE application, you can republish it using a different theme number.  Applications can have multiple themes, but only one active theme. By switching  themes, applications can easily test a new version, safe in the knowledge that changing  back to the earlier version is just a matter of switching back to the prior theme.  So before we go any further, create a new TEMPLATE application based on Theme 4,  and let's begin the process of creating our Ext JS theme.  Building a Viewport Page template Several of the examples provided with Ext feature the Viewport utility container,  including the RSS Feed Viewer shown in the screenshot below. The Viewport  automatically renders to the document body, sizing itself to the browser viewport  and dividing the page into up to five distinct regions; the center region is mandatory,  with north, south, east, and west regions being optional.  [ 73 ]               Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX  Viewport regions are configurable, and by setting a few simple attributes, you quickly  find yourself with a very interactive page, with expanding collapsing regions and  splitters to resize regions by clicking and dragging with the mouse.  We are going to build a basic viewport for our APEX page template including   all five regions.  Starting with a standalone template Once again we're going to take a prototyping approach to building an APEX page  template. It's easier to build a standalone HTML page and make sure we've got the  JavaScript right, and then load it into APEX.                 TITLE        <link rel="icon" href="IMAGE_PREFIXfavicon.ico"           type="image x-icon">       <link rel="shortcut icon"           href="IMAGE_PREFIXfavicon.ico"            type="image x-icon">                <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"           href=".. .. extjs resources css ext-all.css">       <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"            href="ex3-1-local-viewport.css">                <script type="text javascript"            src=".. .. extjs adapter ext ext-base.js">               <script type="text javascript"            src=".. .. extjs ext-all.js">               <script type="text javascript"            src="ex3-1-local-viewport.js">                                      LOGO                         [ 74 ]   Chapter 3              NAVIGATION_BAR CUSTOMIZE &APP_USER.

Looking at the header section enclosed by HEAD tags, you can see the standard Ext  components: stylesheet ext-all.css, adapter layer ext-base.js, and library ext- all.js are present. Also included are our application CSS and JavaScript files: ex3- 1-local-viewport.css and ex3-1-local-viewport.js.  The body section, enclosed by BODY markup tags, contains a series of DIV tags  with region IDs, for example, app-north-panel, which will become panels in our  viewport. APEX uses FORM_OPEN and FORM_CLOSE substitution tags to define the  HTML form element wwvFlowForm used for all APEX pages.  In this template, region tags REGION_POSITION_01, REGION_POSITION_02,  and REGION_POSITION_03 are outside of the FORM_OPEN and FORM_CLOSE  substitution tags, so they cannot be used for APEX input items, which we will cover  in more depth shortly in the Issue when input items are outside the form section. The accompanying JavaScript located in ex3-1-local-viewport.js is:  Ext.onReady function  {     Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL = '.. .. extjs resources images default s. gif';          new Ext.Viewport {         layout: 'border',         defaults: {  [ 75 ]   Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX              animCollapse: false,             autoScroll: true         },         items: [{             applyTo: 'app-north-panel',             autoHeight: true,             autoScroll: false,             region: 'north',             style: {padding: '0 5px'},             xtype: 'box'         }, {             contentEl: 'app-south-panel',             height: 30,             region: 'south',             style: {padding: '0 5px'},             xtype: 'box'         }, {             contentEl: 'app-west-panel',               collapseMode: 'mini',             collapsible: true,             margins: '0 0 0 5',             maxSize: 500,             minSize: 100,             region: 'west',             split: true,             title: 'Navigation',             width: 275         }, {             contentEl: 'app-center-panel',             region: 'center',             title: document.title,             xtype: 'panel'         }, {             contentEl: 'app-east-panel',             collapseMode: 'mini',             collapsible: true,             margins: '0 5 0 0',             maxSize: 500,             minSize: 100,             region: 'east',             split: true,             title: 'Actions',             width: 275         }]     } ;    } ;  [ 76 ]   Chapter 3  The JavaScript could be summarized as follows:  Ext.onReady function  {     Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL = '.. .. extjs resources images default s. gif';          new Ext.Viewport { configuration } ;    } ;  Looking at the summarized version, we are passing an anonymous function to   Ext.onReady, which executes the function after waiting for only the document  structure to be fully parsed and the HTML converted into a DOM tree. This   performs better than the traditional window.onload handler, which waits for the  entire page to be fully loaded before executing.  The anonymous function contains two statements; the first assigns the location image  of the 1x1 pixel transparent spacer image using the following code:      Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL = '.. .. extjs resources images default s.gif';  The second statement instantiates a new Ext.Viewport object passing its  configuration settings as a config object:      new Ext.Viewport { ..configuration.. } ;     Ext.Viewport is a specialized container that renders to the document body,  automatically resizing when the browser window is resized. Viewports contain up to  five pre-defined regions  or panels  defined in the items object, with the center region  being mandatory. Each of these panels is separately configured, and can inherit  default configurations from the viewport.      new Ext.Viewport {         layout: 'border',         defaults: {             animCollapse: false,             autoScroll: true         },         items: [{             applyTo: 'app-north-panel',             autoHeight: true,             autoScroll: false,             region: 'north',             style: {padding: '0 5px'},             xtype: 'box'         }, {  [ 77 ]    Chapter 3  There is almost nothing in our CSS file; just one rule to right align the   app-navigation-bar DIV element in our template. With so little content   in our CSS file, it's hardly worth having a separate file; we could instead   just include it within the page.  Remember here that we're taking the first step in building our application CSS, and  we are going to be adding more rules as we go. So let's start a good habit and include  the CSS that is going to be used by every page request using the template in a  separate file, taking advantage of static file caching by the browser and reducing the  size of our dynamically generated page.     This screenshot shows what our prototype looks like in the browser window.   The north region on the left-hand side contains APEX substitution tags LOGO for the  application logo, and REGION_POSITION_01 for breadcrumbs. The right-hand side  contains substitution tags for NAVIGATION_BAR, CUSTOMIZE, and &APP_USER.  [ 79 ]   Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX  The west region is titled Navigation, and contains the REGION_POSITION_02  substitution tag. As the name suggests, you would include links in this panel  to navigate your application. Similarly, the east region contains the REGION_ POSITION_03 substitution tag, and could be used for actions specific to the page.  The center region's title is dynamically assigned in our viewport definition to use  JavaScript document.title property, which in our page is the TITLE substitution  tag. The center region body contains the FORM_OPEN and FORM_CLOSE tags that  enclose the notification and message substitution tags GLOBAL_NOTIFICATION,  SUCCESS_MESSAGE, NOTIFICATION_MESSAGE, along with the BOX_BODY  substitution tag for our page content.  The south region here contains some plain text, and would typically be used for page  referencing and copyright information.  Loading the page template into APEX So all that remains is to transfer the prototype into APEX as a page template, and  then make a couple of minor adjustments.  Currently the path to our included JavaScript and CSS files is:                <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"           href=".. .. extjs resources css ext-all.css">       <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"            href="ex3-1-local-viewport.css">                <script type="text javascript"           src=".. .. extjs adapter ext ext-base.js">               <script type="text javascript"           src=".. .. extjs ext-all.js">               <script type="text javascript"           src="ex3-1-local-viewport.js">          [ 80 ]    Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX  Now, open one of the existing page templates. This example uses the No Tabs with  Sidebar template. Replace content of the header, body, and footer regions with the  updated content from the prototype, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 82 ]   Chapter 3  Rename the template to EXTJS No Tabs with Sidebar, so it's easy to recognize the  updated template and apply the changes. Finally, copy the ex3-1-local-viewport.js and ex3-1-local-viewport.js files  onto your web server in the location referenced in the page template.  Create a blank page using the newly created template, and run the page. It should  look the next screenshot:  Looking at the North panel, we haven't specified a logo in the Application properties  so the LOGO substitution tag has been replaced with an empty value. The layout  issues on the right-hand side with the navigation bar and user name are caused by  additional HTML included in the Subtemplate section of the page template. The  appearance of the links in the header needs further refinement, which we will do a  little later under breadcrumb templates. So, although we have made a good start on  the page template, there is still more to do.  [ 83 ]   Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX  To fix the navigation bar on the right-hand side so that the user name is on the same  line, update the page template, changing the Subtemplate as follows.  Navigation Bar - remove the div tag Before After   BAR_BODY  BAR_BODY  Navigation Bar Entry- remove the class attribute Before After   TEXT   TEXT   While we are working on the Subtemplate, we might as well modify the Success  Message and the Notification entries also.  The Success Message, shown at the top of the preceding screenshot, uses the  following HTML:      <div class="x-tool x-tool-close"         onclick="Ext.fly 'app-notification' .remove  ;"         style="display: block; margin-left:5px">&nbsp;     SUCCESS_MESSAGE     And it requires the following CSS rule to be included in the CSS file:  .app-success {     background:none repeat scroll 0 0 DFE8F6;     border:1px dotted 99BBE8;     color:15428B;     cursor:default;     clear: both;     font:normal 11px tahoma,arial,sans-serif;     padding:5px 0;     text-align:center;     margin:10px 30%; width:40%; }  [ 84 ]   Functionally, it is the same as the standard APEX content it replaces; a DIV region  displaying a message, with an image that deletes the region when clicked. JavaScript  purists may complain about including JavaScript code in the highlighted onclick  attribute.  The "better" way would be to remove the onclick attribute and adding the following  code to add a listener in your application JavaScript:  Chapter 3  Ext.onReady function  {      *… application code before…*       if  Ext.fly 'app-notification'   {         Ext.fly 'app-notification' .on 'click', function  {             this.remove  ;         } ;     } } ;  Both ways achieve the desired outcome; it's just a matter of personal preference  which way you want to code. The Notification entry in the previous screenshot is a more complicated layout based  on the HTML created by Ext.Alert, allowing the reuse of existing Ext CSS rules.  It provides similar functionality to the Success Message; the HTML source is in  chapter03 ex3-2-local-viewport.html.  The page template now has all the page definition and also the Subtemplate sections  completed. But that's not the end of the page template just yet! There is a nasty issue  potentially lurking in the template, where input items can appear outside the FORM  element, which needs to be addressed.  Issue when input items are outside the form As web developers, we are becoming more reliant on using JavaScript to manipulate  the page layout to provide functionality such as tab panels, accordion regions, popup  dialogs, and the like. This leads to existing elements in the DOM being relocated to  new positions, and form INPUT items can end up outside the FORM element.  [ 85 ]   Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX  Irrespective of what JavaScript library you use, DOM manipulation can lead to form  INPUT items appearing outside the FORM element. In fact, you don't even need to use  JavaScript at all to cause the issue, as we will show in this example.  This screenshot shows the Page Definition within APEX Builder for a simple page  containing the following items of interest:   	 The Contact Details region to be rendered in location Body  3  [BOX_ BODY], with input items P30_FIRST_NAME, P30_LAST_NAME, and P30_ ADDRESS.   	 The Region outside FORM region to be rendered in location Position 2   [REGION_POSITION_02], containing item P30_PHONE.  If you refer to the earlier page template, it shows the REGION_POSITION_02 clearly  outside the FORM_OPEN and FORM_CLOSE substitution tags.  [ 86 ]   When the page is rendered, and after the layout has been changed using JavaScript, a  simplified view of the HTML looks like this:          Chapter 3  <form action="wwv_flow.accept" method="post" name="wwv_flow"  id="wwvFlowForm">                           This shows the highlighted input item, where ID P30_PHONE is clearly outside the  FORM tags.  From the HTML code shown, you can see the action for the form is wwv_flow. accept and the item names are p_t01 .. p_t04, corresponding to the database  package procedure and parameters being executed by the mod_plsql HTTP request.  When the form is submitted, the values for the inputs are loaded into session state,  page processing occurs, and the APEX engine branches to a page. In this example,  there is no processing, simply branching to the same page, so the page is rendered  again with the passed values.  So, given the P30_PHONE item is not in the form it shouldn't be processed, but what  about the items within the form? The following is the result of submitting the form,  showing submitted and returned values:  ID P30_PHONE P30_FIRST_NAME P30_LAST_NAME P30_ADDRESS  Name p_t01 p_t02 p_t03 p_t04  Submitted value aaa bbb ccc ddd  Returned value - - bbb ccc  So as expected, no value is returned for P30_PHONE, because it was outside the form.  However, there is an unexpected displacement of the values, shifting them down,  so the P30_FIRST_NAME submitted value of bbb is returned in P30_LAST_NAME, and  similarly the value for P30_LAST_NAME is returned in P30_ADDRESS. The whereabouts  of the value for P30_ADDRESS is unknown and is not easily explained.  [ 87 ]   Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX  Without having access to the source code for the APEX engine, it is only possible to  speculate on why this occurs. Nevertheless, we still need to deal with the issue and  come up with a strategy to prevent it from occurring.  Ensuring that input items always remain with  the form To ensure form items always remain within the FORM element, we need to address  both the static HTML issue and potential JavaScript DOM manipulation.  Modify the page template so that all region substitution tags are contained   within the FORM_OPEN and FORM_CLOSE substitution tags, as shown in the  following screenshot:   [ 88 ]   Chapter 3  The previous screenshot shows the updated Viewport template, addressing the static  HTML side of the issue. The FORM_OPEN tag now appears immediately after the    markup, and the FORM_CLOSE tag immediately before the   markup.   The only other change is that the application JavaScript file is now   ex3-1-custom-viewport.js, which addresses the JavaScript DOM manipulation.  To ensure form items always remain within the form element, we can use  a customized version of Ext.Viewport, which uses the APEX form element  wwvFlowForm as the container for the viewport, instead of the body element.     create custom namespace if doesn't exist Ext.ns 'Ext.apex' ;     custom container Ext.apex.Viewport = Ext.extend Ext.Container, {   initComponent : function   {     Ext.apex.Viewport.superclass.initComponent.call this ;         APEX specific code     this.el = Ext.get 'wwvFlowForm' ;     if this.el {       this.el.addClass 'x-viewport' ;       var debug = Ext.getDom 'pdebug' ;       if  ! debug &&  debug.value == 'YES'    {         document.getElementsByTagName 'html' [0].className += '  x-viewport';       }     } else {       this.el = Ext.getBody  ;       document.getElementsByTagName 'html' [0].className   += '  x-viewport';     }      this.el.setHeight = Ext.emptyFn;     this.el.setWidth = Ext.emptyFn;     this.el.setSize = Ext.emptyFn;     this.el.dom.scroll = 'no';     this.allowDomMove = false;     this.autoWidth = true;     this.autoHeight = true;     Ext.EventManager.onWindowResize this.fireResize, this ;     this.renderTo = this.el;   },  [ 89 ]   Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX    fireResize : function w, h {     this.fireEvent 'resize', this, w, h, w, h ;   } } ;     Register container so that lazy instantiation may be used Ext.reg 'apex-viewport', Ext.apex.Viewport ;  The script starts by creating a custom namespace, Ext.apex, to ensure that we don't  pollute the global namespace. The Ext.apex.Viewport is then defined, which is a  direct copy of the Ext.Viewport, excepting the highlighted APEX specific code.  For APEX, the code checks to see if the APEX form element with the wwvFlowForm  ID is present in the page, and if yes, whether it uses this as containing item for the  Viewport. When wwvFlowForm is not present, it reverts to standard Ext.Viewport  functionality, using the document body instead. This is useful when previewing the  page template, or selecting the location for a region in the APEX Builder.  Finally, the container is registered so that lazy instantiation can be used using the  xtype attribute value of apex-viewport. See the panel definitions in the application  code for examples of xtypes box and panel.  A check is also done to see if APEX is in debug mode, and if yes, it ensures the  HTML page allows scrolling, otherwise scrolling is disabled for the page and  scrolling is managed within the viewport using Ext features.  To use the custom viewport, we simply replace calls to Ext.Viewport with Ext. apex.Viewport like this:  Ext.onReady function  {     Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL = '.. .. extjs resources images default s. gif';          new Ext.apex.Viewport { configuration } ;    } ;  The custom viewport needs to appear before the application code in the JavaScript  file. The application code has also been modified to show the east panel only when  its container app-east-panel has child nodes other than text.  Ext.onReady function  {     var items = [];      Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL = ' i 1px_trans.gif';      items.push {  [ 90 ]   Chapter 3              applyTo: 'app-north-panel',             autoHeight: true,             autoScroll: false,             region: 'north',             style: {padding: '0 5px'},             xtype: 'box'         }, {             contentEl: 'app-south-panel',             autoScroll: false,             height: 30,             region: 'south',             style: {padding: '0 5px'},             xtype: 'box'         }, {             contentEl: 'app-west-panel',               collapseMode: 'mini',             collapsible: true,             margins: '0 0 0 5',             maxSize: 500,             minSize: 100,             region: 'west',             split: true,             title: 'Navigation',             width: 275         }, {             contentEl: 'app-center-panel',             region: 'center',             title: document.title,             xtype: 'panel'         } ;         conditionally add east panel if it contains child nodes     if  Ext.fly 'app-east-panel'  &&          Ext.fly 'app-east-panel' .first    {         items.push {             contentEl: 'app-east-panel',             collapseMode: 'mini',             collapsible: true,             margins: '0 5 0 0',             maxSize: 500,             minSize: 100,             region: 'east',             split: true,             title: 'Actions',  [ 91 ]   Building a Ext JS Theme into APEX              width: 275         } ;     }      new Ext.apex.Viewport {         layout: 'border',         defaults: {             animCollapse: false,             autoScroll: true         },         items: items     } ; } ;  The page template is now complete and the issue of input items appearing outside  the form element has been resolved.  Summary We have seen how APEX page processing fits a typical Model-View-Controller   MVC  pattern, where the view is the HTML generated using the application  templates. The APEX engine is the controller and receives the GET or POST input  and decides what to do with it, handing it over to domain objects. The domain  objects model is encapsulated in the page definition and contains the business rules  and functionality to carry out specific tasks.  This separation of concerns provided by the MVC pattern allows APEX to easily  swap themes for an application. The publishing mechanism allows new versions of a  theme to be built separately from the application. By switching themes, applications  can easily test a new version, safe in the knowledge that we can revert to the earlier  version if required.  We then set about creating a page template, using a standalone prototype initially to  make sure the markup and JavaScript works correctly before loading it into APEX.  Once a few adjustments were made to load it, the page template was up and running  in APEX. This revealed some layout issues with the navigation sub-template  which  was corrected , as along with the success and error notifications.  [ 92 ]   Chapter 3  Finally, the issue of JavaScript DOM manipulation potentially causing input items  appearing outside the form element was demonstrated. A custom version of Ext. Viewport was developed to ensure that this would never happen in our page template.  While we won't be going through any more page templates here, it is very  worthwhile to put some time into the "Login" template before you preview your  application to anyone. After all, first impressions count, and the first page people  will see is the Login page.  In the next chapter we turn our attention to other APEX template types used within  the page template for regions, labels, and lists.  [ 93 ]                Ext Themed Regions,   Labels, and Lists  This chapter continues building a theme based on Ext into APEX, developing  templates for the regions, labels, and lists.   Regions act as the basic building block for content within a page. Each page can  hold an unlimited number of regions. The appearance of regions is controlled using  Region templates, which can use a mixture of HTML markup, CSS, and JavaScript to  control the visual and structural layout.  HTML lists are enormously versatile when combined with CSS layouts, due to their  graphically flexible nature. In this chapter we will develop list templates, which use  traditional CSS styling, as well as using list templates to act as a JavaScript generator  to integrate with the Ext JS TreePanel component.  In this chapter we will cover:   	 Creating region templates using Ext JS panels  	 Adding JavaScript functionality to region templates  	 Creating simple label templates  	 Using Ext JS QuickTips for error messages  	 Styling simple list templates relying on just HTML and CSS  	 Using list templates to integrate the Ext JS TreePanel component   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  Region templates The APEX Theme 4 we are using as our "starter" theme contains 22 region templates,  one for each of the region template classes. Using this many template classes in an  application can only lead to confusion and inconsistencies. Oracle has provided so  many alternatives to give you a wide range of templates from which to pick and  choose when designing your application layout, but don't expect that you would use  them all.  Well-designed APEX applications will typically rationalize this down to a small  number of region templates used for the everyday functionality covering most of the  application, and then perhaps add a few "specialized" region templates.  Region templates must contain a BODY token; all other allowable tokens are  optional. Tokens for the title TITLE, REGION_ID or REGION_STATIC_ID, and  REGION_ATTRIBUTES are commonly included.  Button position names, such as EDIT, CLOSE, CREATE, CREATE2, EXPAND,  HELP, DELETE, COPY, NEXT, and PREVIOUS are also commonly included.  Similar to reducing the number of template types, it's a good idea to rationalize the  number of button position names to just a few. Because buttons can be assigned to  any button position name, the ordering of buttons can be mostly managed through  sequencing of buttons within the page region.  Report Region The Ext Basic Panel works well here for the Report Region template, which is  typically used for "classic" reports.  To construct the "Basic Panel, No JavaScript" template shown in the previous  screenshot, the following HTML has been used:                   TITLE   [ 96 ]   Chapter 4                                                       PREVIOUSNEXTDELETECOPYCHANGE                            BODY                     If you refer the Ext documentation for Ext.Panel - frame config option, available   at http:  dev.sencha.com deploy dev docs ?class=Ext.Panel, you will see   the same HTML is generated for a dynamically constructed panel. We are including  the panel-specific structural markup to reproduce the visual appearance of the Ext. Panel component.   Two minor additions to the Ext markup have been included, both shown in bold.  Adding the ux-panel CSS class to the outer DIV allows customization of the DIV  and its child components without affecting other objects using the Ext CSS classes.  For example, the following CSS adds a margin at the bottom of the Panel to create  a vertical spacing between panels. Also added is some padding to the body of the  panel, so contained elements are not hard up against the border.  .ux-panel {margin-bottom: 10;} .ux-panel .x-panel-body {padding: 5px}  The other change included is the align="right" attribute to the x-panel-tbar DIV,  used to right align button elements.  To make the Report Region template collapsible, simply add the following JavaScript  immediately after the HTML in the template body:     Ext.onReady function  {    new Ext.Panel {         allowDomMove : false,         applyTo: 'REGION_STATIC_ID',         animCollapse: false,         autoHeight: true,         collapsible:true,         titleCollapse: true     } ;  } ;    [ 97 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  Setting config option applyTo with the REGION_STATIC_ID tag will render the  Panel to the corresponding DOM node. When applyTo is used, the Ext.Panel   code checks the DOM node for constituent parts of the panel specified by CSS  class names within the main element. The panel will automatically create those  components from that markup. Any required components not specified in the  markup will be auto-generated if necessary.  The following class names are supported  baseCls defaults to x-panel :   	 baseCls + '-header'  	 baseCls + '-header-text'  	 baseCls + '-bwrap'  	 baseCls + '-tbar'  	 baseCls + '-body'  	 baseCls + '-bbar'  	 baseCls + '-footer'  The other config options make the panel collapsible, adding a collapse icon in the  top right of the header bar. When the icon is clicked, the panel body collapses to be  completely hidden. The icon inverts, and clicking on it again restores the panel body.  Setting the titleCollapse option to true allows you to click anywhere in the title to  collapse the panel body.  Form Region In case of Form Regions, it is useful to distinguish them visually from non-editable  regions. Once again we will use the Ext Basic Panel, this time using the "framed" look.  [ 98 ]   The following is the HTML code for the Framed Panel, No JavaScript, shown in the  previous screenshot:  Chapter 4                                           TITLE                                                                                   PREVIOUSNEXTDELETECOPYCHANGE                                      BODY                                                                                     Like the Basic Panel used for the Reports Region template, it contains the same  basic "structural" DIV elements, with the addition of a series of DIVs to provide the  rounded corners. The CSS rules applied to the panel body are different, providing  the blue background color, and more significant visual difference, we are after.  [ 99 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  The HTML code for the Framed Panel, Collapsible region is much simpler. It is  quite similar to that used for the Basic Panel in the Reports Region template.                   TITLE                       PREVIOUSNEXTDELETECOPYCHANGE             BODY      The differences being the x-panel-bwrap DIV is not present, and the x-panel-tbar  DIV is a sibling instead of a child node of the x-panel-body DIV.    The previous screenshot shows the HTML without the JavaScript to convert it into a  Framed Panel. It looks like an imperfect version of the Basic Panel. The reason behind  this much simpler HTML gets back to the applyTo config option for Ext.Panel, which  is looking for the "structural" class names to convert within the main element. If we  kept the Framed Panel, No JavaScript version, the Ext.Panel JavaScript does not check  for the "visual classes", so they are ignored leading to a questionable result.  The JavaScript to create the Framed Panel is once again almost identical, the only  difference being the frame: true config option:    Ext.onReady function  {     new Ext.Panel {         applyTo: 'REGION_STATIC_ID',         animCollapse: false,         autoHeight: true,         collapsible:true,         frame: true,         titleCollapse: true     } ; } ;    [ 100 ]   Additional region templates Undoubtedly you will need more region templates than we have created here. As we  progress through the chapters, we will be adding more specialized templates as we  go, and revisiting the ones we have created.  For the Form Region and Report Region templates, and some additional variations of  both, which include a toolbar region, see chapter04 ex-4-panels.html.  Chapter 4  Label templates Label templates have only five predefined classes:   	 No Label  	 Optional Label  	 Optional Label with Help  	 Required Label  	 Required Label with Help  Probably the only real decision required for which classes you need to define  templates is whether or not your application is going to use item-level help.  The need to distinguish between optional and mandatory labels visually, as well as  the need to easily hide labels, indicates that you will need to define a template for  each of these classes.  [ 101 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  This screenshot shows the optional and mandatory labels we will be creating,  with the mandatory label including a red asterisk to differentiate it visually. The  appearance of the labels is similar to that used for Ext labels; however, the HTML  markup and CSS used has to be completely customized because APEX uses HTML  tables to layout items and labels.  Optional label The HTML for the optional label is as follows:  Before label:  <span id="CURRENT_ITEM_NAME-label"       class="ux-form-item-label">    After label:       On error before label:  On error after label:     The CSS that is used with the label is:   <div class="ux-status-error" ext:qclass="x-form-invalid-tip"  ext:qtip="ERROR_MESSAGE">  .ux-form-item-label{     font:normal 11px tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; }  .ux-status-error {     background: transparent no-repeat 3px 2px;     background-image: url  ux extjs resources images default form  exclamation.gif ;     color: CC3333;     cursor: pointer;     display: inline;     line-height:16px;     padding:2px 2px 2px 25px; }  [ 102 ]   Chapter 4  The HTML used for the label is very basic, simply a label element referencing its  item using the CURRENT_ITEM_NAME tag, which is then enclosed by a span element.  The purpose for wrapping the label with a span element is that it allows more CSS  rules to be applied than the label element. For example, you could specify a CSS  rule setting a fixed width for the span, but if you tried to do the same for the label  element, the rule would simply be ignored.  QuickTips for error messages Looking at following screenshot, you can see one of the issues faced when displaying  inline error messages. The input items have been pushed to the right, the length of  the error message forcing the input item to be partially obscured.  So, how can we overcome this problem while still providing meaningful inline   error messages?   One way is to include a small error image and include the error message in the title  and alt attributes, so when the mouse hovers over it the message is revealed as a  tooltip. Ext has taken this concept and improved it with Ext.QuickTips, as shown in  the following screenshot:  [ 103 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  Ext.QuickTips provides attractive and customizable tooltips for any element, and  can be configured via tag attributes directly in markup.  Ext documentation summarizes the supported attributes  optional unless   otherwise noted .   	 hide: Specifying "user" is equivalent to setting autoHide = false. Any   other value will be the same as autoHide = true.   	 qclass: A CSS class to be applied to the quick tip  equivalent to the "cls"    	 qtip  required : The quick tip text  equivalent to the "text" target    target element config .  element config .   	 qtitle: The quick tip title  equivalent to the "title" target element config .  	 qwidth: The quick tip width  equivalent to the "width" target    element config .  You can also configure the QuickTips singleton in addition to the   supported attributes.  To enable Ext.QuickTips, you need to include a call to Ext.QuickTips.init in your  application JavaScript.   Ext.onReady function  {         Init the singleton.        Any tag-based quick tips will start working.     Ext.QuickTips.init  ;         Apply a set of config properties to the singleton.        Use interceptTitles to pick up title attribute,        excepting IE as cannot prevent tooltip appearing also.     Ext.apply Ext.QuickTips.getQuickTip  , {         interceptTitles:  !Ext.isIE ,         maxWidth: 300,         minWidth: 100,         showDelay: 50,         trackMouse: true     } ;         more code } ;  [ 104 ]   Chapter 4  For the example provided in the previous screenshot, the markup for the Last Name  label with its error message looks like:  <div class="ux-status-error" ext:qclass="x-form-invalid-tip"  ext:qtip="Last name must be specified and must contain upper and lower  case letters.">          Last Name         The DIV element has a class attribute of ux-status-error, which displays a  background image, padding the element sufficiently to display the image and  provide some spacing before the label text.   Specifying the ext:qclass="x-form-invalid-tip" attribute means the QuickTip  will use an Ext CSS rule specifically designed for errors, rather than the standard  QuickTip styling.  Optional label with help The HTML is identical to that of the optional label, with an additional link element:  <span id="CURRENT_ITEM_NAME-label"       class="ux-form-item-label">      Before label:  After label:         On error before label:  On Error after label:     <div class="ux-status-error" ext:qclass="x-form-invalid-tip"  ext:qtip="ERROR_MESSAGE">  [ 105 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  The CSS that is used with the label is:   .ux-form-item-label a {     color:1E4176;     cursor:pointer;     text-decoration:none;     -moz-outline: none;     outline: none; }  .ux-form-item-label a:hover {     text-decoration:underline; }  The HTML used here is the same as for the optional label, with the inclusion  of a link <a href="javascript:popupFieldHelp 'CURRENT_ITEM_ID',  '&SESSION.' "> , which calls the APEX JavaScript to display item help in a  popup window.  Additional CSS has been included to make the link visually similar, but not the same  as the optional label, with a subtle color difference and different cursor to provide  visual cues for a different behavior. When the mouse hovers over the label, it is  underlined, reinforcing again the cue for a different behavior.  Mandatory label The HTML for the mandatory label is almost identical to the optional label:  Before label:  <span id="CURRENT_ITEM_NAME-label"       class="ux-form-item-label">    After label:   *       On error before label:  [ 106 ]  <div class="ux-status-error" ext:qclass="x-form-invalid-tip"  ext:qtip="ERROR_MESSAGE">   Chapter 4  On error after label:     The only difference between the optional and mandatory labels is the addition of the   *  markup in the After Label section, and the additional CSS rule to make  the asterisk red:  .ux-form-item-label em {color:CC3333;}  Mandatory label with help The HTML is identical to that of the mandatory label, with an additional link element  used to display field-level, context-sensitive help:  <span id="CURRENT_ITEM_NAME-label"       class="ux-form-item-label">      <div class="ux-status-error" ext:qclass="x-form-invalid-tip"  ext:qtip="ERROR_MESSAGE">  No additional CSS is required for the link element, which uses the same CSS rules as  the optional label with help.   Hidden label The HTML for the hidden label is even simpler:  Before label:     [ 107 ]  Before label:  After label:   *         On error before label:  On error after label:      Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  After label:     On error before label:  On error after label:  &nbsp;   <div class="ux-status-error" ext:qclass="x-form-invalid-tip"  ext:qtip="ERROR_MESSAGE">  For this label, we are using a SPAN element with an Ext class named x-hidden to  hide the label text. The On error label markup remains the same as the optional label,  allowing errors to be displayed even when no label is visible. An extra HTML string   &nbsp;  has been added to ensure the error icon displays correctly when no text has  been provided for the label.  This wraps up the section on Label templates, which really are quite straightforward,  just requiring a minimal amount HTML markup and some CSS styling. The addition  of Ext.QuickTips here neatly solves the problem of error messages ruining   region layouts while retaining APEX provided functionality for item-level,   context-sensitive help.  List templates Lists are one of the most versatile HTML elements, providing a way to display  content and information in a very easy way to scan and read. APEX contains a great  variety of lists already with its built-in themes, as is evident by the template classes  for lists:               	 Button List  	 Hierarchical Expanded  	 Hierarchical Expanding  	 Horizontal Images with Label List  	 Horizontal Links List  	 Pull Down Menu  	 Pull Down Menu with Image  	 Tabbed Navigation List  	 Vertical Images List  	 Vertical Ordered List  [ 108 ]   Chapter 4   	 Vertical Sidebar List  	 Vertical Unordered List with Bullets  	 Vertical Unordered List without Bullets  	 Wizard Progress List  The list templates display data defined in APEX lists, and may be flat or hierarchical  in structure. A list is considered to be hierarchical when a parent-child relationship  has been defined in the list for one or more entries.      If your lists become overly complicated or lose their simplicity, you will have lost  the essence of the list and will lose your visitors' interest as well. To start with, let's  create the list templates shown in previous screenshot.  Vertical unordered list without bullets The list template has a large number of fields available to use; only the ones being  populated are shown here.   	 Name: EXTJS vertical unordered list without bullets  	 Template Class: Vertical unordered list without bullets  List template before rows:       List template current:    TEXT    [ 109 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  List template current with sub list items:    TEXT      List template noncurrent:    TEXT    List template noncurrent with sub list items:    TEXT      Sublist template current:    TEXT    Sublist template current with sub list items:    TEXT      Sublist template noncurrent:    TEXT    Sublist template noncurrent with sub list items:    TEXT      Sublist template after rows:       For a flat list, the sublist fields are unnecessary, and removing the sublist markup  would make absolutely no difference. However, not having the sublist markup  would mean a hierarchical list would only display the top-level list items. For this  reason, it's a good practice to define the sublist markup and apply CSS styling to suit.  Ext includes some CSS rules to "reset" unordered lists and list items, removing  margins, padding, and list item indicators; so, before we add any CSS rules of our  own, both a flat list and a hierarchical list look like Before CSS styling list in the  following screenshot, which is close to the desired result:   [ 110 ]   Chapter 4  The following CSS will produce the look of the After CSS styling list shown earlier  in previous screenshot:  .ux-list li {     color:ccc;     line-height:16px;     font-family: helvetica,arial,tahoma,sans-serif !important;     font-size:11px; }  .ux-list {   background:fff;   padding:10px;   text-align:left;   border:0 none transparent; }  .ux-list .ux-list-selected {     background-color:D9E8FB; }  .ux-list a {     color:555555;     padding-left:2px; }  .ux-list a:link, .ux-list a:visited, .ux-list a:active {     color:555555;     text-decoration:none;  [ 111 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  }  .ux-list a:hover {     color:0464BB;     text-decoration:underline; }  .ux-list .ux-list-selected a {     color:000000; }  By wrapping a DIV tag around the list and assigning a class name of ux-list to the  DIV tag, all unordered list and list items within don't need any class attributes. This  reduces the size of the generated markup slightly, and also makes it easy to restyle  the list by changing the class name for the DIV, as we will see in the next template.   For the "Current" fields, the ux-list-selected class has been added, but because  the corresponding CSS rules are prefixed by ux-list, changing the class name for  the DIV will follow on to any "current" list item.  Vertical unordered list with bullets To create this template, all we need to do is copy the "EXTJS vertical unordered list  without bullets" template using the APEX copy feature on the Shared Components   Templates page within APEX Application Builder and make the following edits: Name: EXTJS Vertical Unordered List with Bullets Template Class: Vertical Unordered List with Bullets List Template Before Rows:       Surprised at how little was changed?   Because the structure of the list isn't being changed, only the CSS class needs to be  modified and additional CSS rules added:  .ux-list-bullet ul {     list-style-type: square;     margin-left:13px; }  [ 112 ]   In this case, the original class ux-list was kept and a second class name   ux-list-bullet added. For CSS styling it means the original classes are   applied and any new classes have their attributes added.   Chapter 4     The addition of the one CSS rule adds the square bullet to the list, with the left  margin indenting the list, and for hierarchical sublists, the indent is multiplied by the  number of levels. The previous screenshot shows the difference between a flat list  and a hierarchical list using the template.  Building an Ext JS tree template using lists Every computer user is immediately familiar with using a tree view for navigating in  an application. Tree components allow hierarchical data to be presented in a compact  and structured manner, allowing the user to interact to hide or show information.   APEX hierarchical lists are ideal for presenting static data, and using the built-in   lists to store and display the data provide some advantages over a custom   table-based solution.  Built-in lists allow you to use conditional logic when displaying list entries using  either the "Conditions" fields, or "Authorization Scheme". This means you can  conditionally show items depending on security privileges, or show or hide items  based on some application state.  [ 113 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  A second advantage is the list data is part of the APEX application export, so you  don't need to remember to migrate data from application tables.  Let's take a look at the prototype, chapter04 ex-4-tree-panel.html, shown in  previous screenshot, and examine the JavaScript used to construct the tree.        Ext.onReady function  {       define tree data as an object   var treeData = {text:"Root Node", expanded:true, children:[   {id:"L01",text:"Cars",       href:"",leaf:false,children: [   {id:"L02",text:"Passenger",  href:"",leaf:true},   {id:"L03",text:"4WD",        href:"",leaf:true}]},   {id:"L04",text:"Marine",     href:"",leaf:false,children: [   {id:"L05",text:"Motorized",  href:"",leaf:false,children: [   {id:"L06",text:"Diesel",     href:"",leaf:true}]},   {id:"L07",text:"Sail",       href:"",leaf:true}]},   {id:"L08",text:"Motorcycles",href:"",leaf:false,children: [   {id:"L09",text:"Road",       href:"",leaf:true},   {id:"L10",text:"Off Road",   href:"",leaf:true}]}   ]};       create the tree   new Ext.tree.TreePanel {       renderTo:'tree-div',       useArrows:true,  [ 114 ]   Chapter 4        autoScroll:true,       animate:true,       border:false,       rootVisible: false,       root: treeData   } ;   } ;    Looking at the prototype code, you can see two separate code blocks, the first being a  JavaScript object of tree node definitions. Each tree node has the id, text, href, and  leaf properties defined, except the root node, which just has the text and expanded  properties defined.  Ext JS automatically assigns an ID to each tree node if it doesn't already have an  ID assigned, so the ID is optional. The generated ID is a text string in the form ext- genN, with N being replaced with a number. The reason behind assigning an ID  to the other elements is the fact that we are interacting with the backend server,  asynchronously loading tree nodes or manipulating nodes, and those nodes are  associated with backend data such as a database records primary key, so it's very  useful to be able to match nodes with the backend data.   However, the root node is an artificial construct, required by Ext.tree.TreePanel,  because every tree must have only one root node.  The second code block instantiates an Ext.tree.TreePanel object, passing a  configuration block. Along with configuring how the tree is to be displayed, it also  assigns the root to the treeData object defined in the first code block, and sets the  renderTo:'tree-dev' property to use the DIV markup immediately before the  script block.  APEX 4.0 tree template Release 4 of APEX added the "Template Definitions for First Entry" section to the List  Template, including four new fields:   	 List Template Current  First   	 List Template Current with Sub List Items  First   	 List Template Noncurrent  First   	 List Template Noncurrent with Sub List Items  First   [ 115 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  These new fields assist in generating a unique ID for the target DIV tag, used to  render the tree. I will show you an alternative version for earlier releases of APEX  shortly, but let's first look at the APEX 4 version.  List template current:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:true,  isCurrent:true}  List template current with sub list items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:false,  isCurrent:true, children:[  List template noncurrent:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:true}  List template noncurrent with Sub List Items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:false,  children:[  Between List Elements:  ,  List template current  first :        Ext.onReady function  {  var treeRegion = 'treeLIST_ITEM_ID';  List template current with sub list items  first :        Ext.onReady function  {  var treeRegion = 'treeLIST_ITEM_ID';  [ 116 ]  var treeData = {text:"Root Node", expanded:true, children: [{id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:true,  isCurrent:true }   var treeData = {text:"Root Node", expanded:true, children: [{id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:false,  isCurrent:true, children: [  Chapter 4  List template noncurrent  first :        Ext.onReady function  {  var treeRegion = 'treeLIST_ITEM_ID';  List template noncurrent with sub list items  first :        Ext.onReady function  {  var treeRegion = 'treeLIST_ITEM_ID';  var treeData = {text:"Root Node", expanded:true, children: [{id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:true}  var treeData = {text:"Root Node", expanded:true, children: [{id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:false,  children: [  Sub list template current:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:true,  isCurrent:true }  Sub list template current with sub list items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:false,  isCurrent:true, children: [  Sub list template noncurrent:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:true}  [ 117 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  Sublist template noncurrent with sub list items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:false, children:  [  Between sub list items:  Sublist template after rows:  List template after rows:  ,   ]}  ]};  new Ext.tree.TreePanel {     renderTo:treeRegion,     useArrows:true,     autoScroll:true,     animate:true,     border:false,     rootVisible: false,     root: treeData } ;  } ;    Traditionally, templates contain HTML markup and occasionally a little JavaScript.  Here we are doing exactly the opposite with just a single DIV element, and using the  rest of the template to generate JavaScript code.  Despite appearances, the template is close to our original prototype; however, there  is one adjustment that had to be made.  In the prototype, the DIV tag the TreePanel component will be rendered into is  specified by the renderTo attribute as a string:       create the tree   new Ext.tree.TreePanel {       renderTo:'tree-div',       useArrows:true,       autoScroll:true,       animate:true,       border:false,       rootVisible: false,       root: treeData   } ;   [ 118 ]   In the APEX template, a variable has been defined and referenced:  Chapter 4        Ext.onReady function  {  var treeRegion = 'treeLIST_ITEM_ID';       code...  new Ext.tree.TreePanel {     renderTo:treeRegion,     useArrows:true,     autoScroll:true,     animate:true,     border:false,     rootVisible: false,     root: treeData } ;  The reason for doing this is that the list template does not allow REGION_ID or  some equivalent substitution tag to be used in the List template before rows field.  To generate a unique ID for DIV, the LIST_ITEM_ID has been used in the first list  item. Because this cannot be referenced later in the List Template After Rows field,  the ID has to be passed by variable reference.  In case you're wondering, the treeRegion variable is local to the anonymous  function enclosed by Ext.onReady, so you could have multiple instances of the  variable without any issue.  Prior APEX versions tree template APEX versions prior to APEX 4.0 don't have the "Template Definitions for First  Entry" section, so it is a two-part solution to create a tree component using a list  template. The tree definition remains mostly unchanged in the list template, the code  in the "First Entry" field needs to be moved to a customized region template.  The markup for the "EXTJS Tree Panel" region is as follows:       Ext.onReady function  { var treeRegion = 'REGION_STATIC_ID';   [ 119 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists     define tree data as an object var treeData = {text:"Root Node", expanded:true, children:[ BODY ]};  new Ext.tree.TreePanel {     renderTo:treeRegion,     useArrows:true,     autoScroll:true,     animate:true,     border:false,     rootVisible: false,     root: treeData } ;  } ;    The region creates a DIV element with an ID populated by the REGION_STATIC_ID  substitution tag. The BODY tag will be populated by the list definition:  List template current:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:true,  isCurrent:true}  List template current with sub list items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:false,  isCurrent:true, children:[  List template noncurrent:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:true}  List template noncurrent with sub list items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:false,  children:[  Between list elements:  ,  Sub list template current:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:true,  isCurrent:true}  [ 120 ]   Chapter 4  Sub list template current with sub list items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:false,  isCurrent:true, children: [  Sub list template noncurrent:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:true}  Sublist template noncurrent with sub list items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID",text:"TEXT",href:"LINK",leaf:false, children:  [  Between sub list items:  Sublist template after rows:  ,   ]}  The only differences between this and the APEX 4.0 version are that the Template  Definitions for First Entry section doesn't exist, and the List Template After Rows  field is blank.  Highlighting the current node To highlight the "current" node in our tree, as shown in the following screenshot, the  list template use the attribute isCurrent:true for the current entries.   For example the "Sub List Template Current" looks like:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID", text:"TEXT", href:"LINK", leaf:true,  isCurrent:true}  [ 121 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  Now we need to modify the JavaScript to detect this attribute and use built-in Ext. tree.treePanel functionality to select the node. Because you're most likely to be using  the tree regularly, it's worthwhile creating a custom component and saving it to your  application JavaScript file, rather than embedding the code within the page. A nice  way of doing this is by extending the Ext JS component.   The code shown here is in chapter04 Ext.apex.tree.TreePanel.js.     create custom namespace if doesn't exist Ext.ns 'Ext.apex.tree' ;   **  * @class Ext.apex.tree.TreePanel  * @extends Ext.tree.TreePanel  *  The APEX TreePanel highlights the first node with "isCurrent"  set to true.   *  Ext.apex.tree.TreePanel = Ext.extend Ext.tree.TreePanel, {   afterRender: function  {     Ext.apex.tree.TreePanel.superclass.afterRender.call this ;     this.highlightCurrentNode  ;   },      highlightCurrentNode: function  {     var path = this.getCurrentNodePath this.root.attributes ;          this.expandPath path, 'id', function isSuccess, currentNode {       if  isSuccess  {         currentNode.select  ;         currentNode.ensureVisible  ;       }     } ;   },      getCurrentNodePath: function node {     if  node.isCurrent  {       return this.pathSeparator + node.id;     }     else {       if  node.children  {         for  var i = 0; node.children.length > i; i += 1  {           var result = this.getCurrentNodePath node.children[i] ;           if  result  {             return this.pathSeparator + node.id + result;           }  [ 122 ]               Chapter 4          }       }     }        not found     return null;   } } ;     Register container so that lazy instantiation may be used Ext.reg 'apex-treepanel', Ext.apex.tree.TreePanel ;  Ext uses lazy loading an Ext.tree.TreeNode's child nodes, meaning the child nodes  are loaded only when a tree node is expanded. This reduces the number of DOM  nodes rendered by the initial tree load and improves performance, particularly for  large trees.  However, it's somewhat inconvenient here, as the Ext.tree.treePanel API doesn't  provide a mechanism to search for nodes that haven't been rendered yet. As the   data for the tree is contained within the page, and not being fetched by an AJAX  request, it's safe to extend the Ext.tree.treePanel to search the tree data for the  unrendered nodes.  And that's what we are doing—searching down the hierarchy path of the root node:    highlightCurrentNode: function  {     var path = this.getCurrentNodePath this.root.attributes ;           this.expandPath path, 'id', function isSuccess, currentNode {       if  isSuccess  {         currentNode.select  ;         currentNode.ensureVisible  ;       }     } ;   },  Once the current node is detected, we use the Ext.tree.treePanel API call  currentNode.select  ; to select  and render  the node, and then scroll it into view  using currentNode.ensureVisible  ;.  To call the extension, just modify the template replacing the reference to   Ext.tree.TreePanel with Ext.apex.tree.TreePanel.  [ 123 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists Customizing individual nodes APEX provides spare substitution tags A01...A10 for list items, allowing you  to add additional content to list items if your list template supports it. It is good  practice to use these spare tags for special templates, and use the standard tags for  lists so that you can easily swap templates on a page-by-page basis.  So, modify all the template items to include A02 after the leaf tag, for example:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID", text:"TEXT", href:"LINK", leaf:trueA02}  Now you have a list item field that stores 2000 characters of additional data.  For example, to change the appearance of a node:  Define a CSS rule for the node icon in your application CSS file, using the  !important attribute to override the normal node icon:  .ux-lock {     background-image: url  ux extjs resources images default grid  hmenu-lock.gif  !important; }  Then add the following text in the A02 field for a node  note the leading comma :  ,iconCls: "ux-lock"  The nodes appearance is now a padlock, as shown in the following screenshot:  With 2000 characters available with which to play, you can do quite a bit, and if that's   not enough, you still have nine of the remaining A01..A10 substitution tags up  your sleeve.  [ 124 ]   Chapter 4  Here's another example, attaching a click handler to a node:  ,iconCls:'ux-lock', listeners:{click:function node, e {        stop standard event     e.stopEvent  ;     Ext.MessageBox.show {          title: 'Credits',          msg: 'Website developed by Snazzy Websites',          buttons: Ext.MessageBox.OK     } ; }}   We will be covering much more on Ext trees in later chapters, but as you can see, you  can do quite a bit just using the list template as your data source.  Summary In this chapter we've covered Region templates, showing how to create static  versions of the Ext.Panel with framed and unframed variants. Then, to make the  regions collapsible, a few lines of JavaScript were added with minor modifications to  the static templates.  For Label templates, we created simple HTML templates using custom CSS to  approximate the Ext look. Inline error messages can create display issues, pushing  items off the display area. By modifying the error attributes for labels to make use of  Ext.QuickTips, a small error icon is displayed instead; when the mouse hovers over  the icon, an error message is revealed.  For List templates, we started by creating some very simple templates relying on  just HTML and CSS, all using the same list structure. By modifying only the class  of a DIV wrapper element, different appearances could be achieved with minimal  additional CSS rules.  APEX lists are ideal for presenting static data, and using the built-in lists has  advantages over a custom table-based solution. Built-in lists allow you to display  entries conditionally based on "Conditions" fields, or "Authorization Scheme". List data  is also part of the application export, so you don't need to remember to include data  from database tables as part of your application promotions.  [ 125 ]   Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists  Using List templates, we implemented the Ext.tree.TreePanel, showing how templates  can also be used to produce JavaScript code and JSON objects, and not just HTML.  Two versions of the Tree Template were created—one for APEX 4.0 and the other  for earlier versions of APEX. Using the current list item template field to identify the  current tree node, the Ext.tree.TreePanel was extended to create a custom component,  allowing the current tree node to be selected and scrolled into view.  Finally, we saw how to customize the appearance of individual tree nodes using  the A01..A10 substitution tags available for each list item, as well as add specific  JavaScript code.   In the next chapter we continue developing templates for the remaining template  types, emphasizing a rich and responsive interface for buttons, popups, calendars,  and reports.   [ 126 ]   Ext Themed Buttons,  Popups, Calendars,   and Reports  Have you ever stopped and asked yourself "What's the difference between a link   and button"?   You press a button when you want something to happen, just as in everyday  life. You press a button to switch on a light, change channels on TV, or start your  computer, washing machine, car, and so on. The BRB, or big red button, is often  featured in movies with the person in charge sweating over the decision of triggering  a self-destructive process. "Whatever you do, do not press the big red button." When  you press a button, there are consequences!  On the other hand, the main purpose of a link is to navigate to another location,  not really affecting anything and no real consequences. In other words, the humble  button on your web application is a really important component and needs to be  given serious design consideration.  We continue building up a theme based on Ext into APEX, developing templates for  the remaining template types: buttons, popup list of values, breadcrumbs, calendars,  and reports.   The modern website user experience is now about rich and responsive user  interfaces, with interfaces displaying intuitive visual cues to communicate the  status of the users' interaction with the system. For instance, clicking on a button  often changes the appearance from "normal" to a "pressed" look, giving immediate  feedback to the user, confirming their action has triggered an action with the system.  By the end of the chapter, you will have a "minimal" theme ready to publish.   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  Button templates APEX allows you to create three styles of buttons: HTML, Template, and Image.   The HTML button creates the native browser-based button with attributes you  can specify; the rendered appearance differs based on your operating system and  browser. The HTML button is lightweight for HTTP requests, but limited in how you  can manipulate its appearance.  The Image button allows you to control the appearance by specifying the image used  and the image attributes. A significant limitation of image-based buttons is that you  have to specify the image details every time you create a button—a real productivity  killer. For this reason alone, I would strongly encourage you not to use image-based  buttons, but rather create a template-based button with the image details included.  The Template button provides you with far greater design flexibility, allowing you to  duplicate the HTML generated by either the HTML or Image style buttons, or create  something with greater functionality.   The additional flexibility Template buttons offer, without the drawbacks of either of  the other button styles, make it the obvious choice for all your buttons.  Over the next few pages, we will explore the following alternative approaches   to buttons:   	 Creating a custom markup button using Sliding Doors and CSS sprites  	 An Ext static markup template button  	  	 Toolbar buttons using pure JavaScript  JavaScript enabling the Ext button  Sliding doors meet CSS sprites Here, we are creating a custom markup button using the sliding doors method to  provide horizontal scalability and creating multiple states by applying different  background images contained in a sprite image. The following screen shows  what we are trying to achieve—a normal button appearance, that is, a light blue  background when the mouse hovers over, and a darker blue background when the  button is pressed. The Apply Changes button shows the appearance of the button is  maintained for variable widths.  [ 128 ]   A standalone example of the finished buttons can be found in chapter05 ex-5- buttons.html.  Chapter 5  The Sliding Doors technique was first introduced on A List Apart  http:  www. alistapart.com articles slidingdoors  . The principle involves making  two images slide over each other, allowing the button to stretch horizontally to  accommodate the button content, as shown in the following diagram. By making one  of the images sufficiently wide, you can accommodate a large range of button widths.  The simplified HTML for this button is:        Button      To hide the buttons border and a ensure consistent layout for different browsers, the  following CSS rules are applied:  button.ux-btn-alt{   border:0;   background:none;   cursor: pointer;   padding:0;   margin:0;   width:auto;   overflow: visible;  * removes extra side padding in IE *    text-align:center;  [ 129 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports    white-space:nowrap;   height: 22px;   }  .ux-btn-alt span, .ux-btn-alt span em {   display: block;   height: 22px;   line-height: 22px; }   * override extra padding in Firefox *  .ux-btn-alt::-moz-focus-inner {   border: 0;   padding: 0; }   * prevent RH edge disappearing when pressed *  .ext-opera .ux-btn-alt span {   margin-right:2px;   margin-bottom:1px; }  .ux-btn-alt em{   color:333333;   font:11px arial,tahoma,helvetica,sans-serif;   }  The border:0 setting removes the border from the button; the remaining settings  ensure the height of the button is the same as the images used and ensure that the  text positioning and appearance is consistent across different browsers.   One way of minimizing HTTP requests is to combine multiple images into a single  image, or sprite, and using the CSS background-image and background-position  properties to display the desired image segment. Here, we are using the sprite  shown in the following figure, which holds left and right images for the button on a  transparent background. The button positions for the "Normal" state are shown with  the left button at  0,0  and the right button at   right,-100px .  [ 130 ]   Chapter 5  .ux-btn-alt em{   padding-left:10px;   background:url btn-sprite.gif  no-repeat 0 0;   }  .ux-btn-alt span{   padding-right:0 10px 0 0;   background:url btn-sprite.gif  no-repeat right -100px;   }  The images for the button are specified using the CSS background property,  a shorthand way of specifying background-image and background-position  properties. The EM element is used for the left image, and the SPAN element is used  for right image. Here, both images have been combined into a single image, using  CSS offsets to reference the right image.   To create the "hover" and "active" appearance for the buttons, we use the CSS  selectors of the same name with the !important attribute to override the  background-position of the SPAN and EM elements:  .ux-btn-alt:hover em, .ux-btn-alt-over em {   background-position: 0 -30px !important; }  .ux-btn-alt:hover span, .ux-btn-alt-over span {   background-position: right -130px !important; }  .ux-btn-alt:active em, .ux-btn-alt-click em{  [ 131 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports    color:000000;   background-position: 0 -60px !important; }  .ux-btn-alt:active span, .ux-btn-alt-click span {   background-position: right -160px !important; }  All modern browsers support the :active pseudo selector; however, when it comes  to supporting the :hover pseudo selector, there is an exception of IE6 and IE7. The  additional ux-btn-alt-over selector was added to be able to include JavaScript to  address this deficiency.  For toolbars, the button borders can be hidden until the mouse hovers over using:  .x-toolbar .ux-btn-alt span, .x-toolbar .ux-btn-alt em {   background-position: 0 -100px; }  APEX sliding door CSS sprite button template To include this little gem as an APEX button template, add the CSS rules and button  sprite to your resource files, and create the following button template:  <button type="button" class="ux-btn-alt ux-btn-markup"  onclick="LINK" value="LABEL" BUTTON_ATTRIBUTES>     LABEL      The complete CSS for the button can be found in chapter05 ex-5-buttons.html,  and is shown below. Just add the images to your resources, and include the CSS in  your project CSS file, adjusting the paths for the images as necessary.  button.ux-btn-alt{   border:0;   background:none;   cursor: pointer;   padding:0;   margin:0;   width:auto;   overflow: visible;  * removes extra side padding in IE *    text-align:center;   white-space:nowrap;   height: 22px;   }  [ 132 ]   Chapter 5  .ux-btn-alt span, .ux-btn-alt span em {   display: block;   height: 22px;   line-height: 22px; }   * override extra padding in Firefox *  .ux-btn-alt::-moz-focus-inner {   border: 0;   padding: 0; }   * prevent RH edge disappearing when pressed *  .ext-opera .ux-btn-alt span {   margin-right:2px;   margin-bottom:1px; }  .ux-btn-alt em{   color:333333;   font:11px arial,tahoma,helvetica,sans-serif; }  .ux-btn-alt em{   padding-left:10px;   background:url btn-sprite.gif  no-repeat 0 0;   }  .ux-btn-alt span{   padding:0 10px 0 0;   background:url btn-sprite.gif  no-repeat right -100px;   }  .ux-btn-alt:hover em, .ux-btn-alt-over em {   background-position: 0 -30px !important; }  .ux-btn-alt:hover span, .ux-btn-alt-over span {   background-position: right -130px !important; }  .ux-btn-alt:active em, .ux-btn-alt-click em{   color:000000;   background-position: 0 -60px !important;  [ 133 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  }  .ux-btn-alt:active span, .ux-btn-alt-click span {   background-position: right -160px !important; }  .x-toolbar .ux-btn-alt span, .x-toolbar .ux-btn-alt em {   background-position: 0 -100px; }  So, there you have it, a cross-browser method for custom styling button elements using  sliding door sprites to provide interactive feedback on hover and when clicked.   Let's have a look now at how we can create an Ext.Button from markup.  Building a hideous Ext.Button The markup used for the standard Ext.Button is made up using in the Ext team's   own words "a hideous table template". Hideous it may be, but the advantage of  using this complex table structure is that it provides enormous flexibility in its  dimensions. The following screenshot shows some of the layouts that can be   created using an Ext.Button:  To create a button template duplicating the Ext layout, the first thing we need to   do is get the markup generated for an Ext.button. This can be done quite easily   using Firebug.  [ 134 ]   Open an example page that has the Ext JavaScript files attached, and run the  following commands from the Firebug console:  Ext.get document.body .update '  ' ;  Chapter 5  new Ext.Button {      text: 'TITLE',     scale:'small',      renderTo: 'test' } ;  The first command replaces the entire HTML document body, with a single DIV  element having an ID of test. The second command renders an Ext.Button into the  DIV. I'm using the small scaled button here, but you may prefer the "medium" or  "large" buttons for your application.  From there, locate the test DIV in the Firebug HTML tab, as shown in the following  screenshot. select it, and using the right-click menu, choose the Copy innerHTML  option and paste it into your favorite text editor.  With a little formatting, the markup looks something like this:  <table style="width: auto;" id="ext-comp-1013" class="x-btn   x-btn- noicon " cellspacing="0">         &nbsp;    [ 135 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports           &nbsp;           &nbsp;                   <button class=" x-btn-text" id="ext-gen15"  type="button">TITLE                &nbsp;           &nbsp;            &nbsp;          To convert this into an APEX button template only requires us to strip out   the ID attributes, and add in the APEX substitution tags for LINK and   BUTTON_ATTRIBUTES. Like every good lazy programmer, I had already   included the LABEL tag when creating the button. The finished markup for the EXTJS Button template is:  <table onclick="LINK" cellspacing="0" class="ux-btn ux-btn-markup  x-btn x-btn-noicon" style="width:auto;" BUTTON_ATTRIBUTES>         &nbsp;            &nbsp;           &nbsp;                    LABEL                &nbsp;      [ 136 ]   Chapter 5        &nbsp;            &nbsp;          The opening TABLE element highlighted in the template needs some explanation.  First, using the onclick="LINK" attribute allows the button to work quite happily  using standard APEX functionality without any further JavaScript manipulation  whatsoever. This provides robustness to the design. As soon as the button has been  rendered, a user can click on the button, and it will execute. For very simple pages,  such as wizards with sensible default values, an experienced user will click through  the page rapidly.  The class="ux-btn ux-btn-markup x-btn x-btn-noicon" has two non-standard  class attributes:  ux-btn-markup acts as a marker that will be used shortly to add some JavaScript  functionality. ux-btn is used to apply the following CSS rules, ensuring standard   Ext buttons created using tables  which are block level elements  are changed to  inline-block elements to allow side-by-side layout.   Ext usually renders buttons in separate table cells to avoid this issue; we need to  allow for this not being the case. IE provides support only for inline-block in version  8 and upwards in some modes, so for IE, use inline instead.  table.ux-btn {display:inline-block} .ext-ie table.ux-btn {display:inline}  Finally, the BUTTON_ATTRIBUTES substitution tag allows the developer to assign a  specific ID attribute to a button. The following shows how you assign the ID in the  Button Display Attributes section of the button:  [ 137 ]    Chapter 5  In Chapter 4, Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists, we saw Ext.Panel detect   panel-specific structural markup when using the applyTo configuration attribute,  converting static APEX region templates into an Ext.Panel. The Ext.Button, however,  does not provide equivalent functionality to detect structural markup, so we need to  add it ourselves.   Ext contains Ext.Extend and Ext.Override utility functions, providing the  mechanism for simulating class inheritance. Using these functions gives you the  ability to modify or extend the base functionality of any JavaScript class without  making code changes directly to the class.  If you are adding or changing the behavior of a class, usually you would use   Ext.Extend to create a new class; however, in this case I've chosen to override the  Ext.Button class because I want the changes to flow through to its child classes. The  following screenshot, taken from the Ext documentation, shows the inheritance path  for Ext.SplitButton; observe that SplitButton extends Button.  By using Ext.Override, the changes to the Button class will be inherited by  SplitButton, which in turn subclasses CycleButton.  The code for the button override is contained in chapter05 Override.Ext.Button. js and includes commenting, which has been stripped out here for brevity.

In the initComponent function, a small piece  of code has been added to detect when a button has been instantiated, with a  transformEl attribute identifying the markup button to be converted. After setting  the isRendered variable to true, the transformEl variable is reassigned to the  applyTo variable, to be used by the standard Ext.Button code.     onRender: function ct, position {       if  !this.template  {          if  !Ext.Button.buttonTemplate  {                hideous table template             Ext.Button.buttonTemplate = new Ext.Template           ' ',                ' ',                '   &160;  ',                '  ',                '  &160;   ',                '   &160;  ',                ' ',                ' ',                '    ',                '  &160;   ',                '   &160;  ',                '  ',                '  &160;   ',                '  ' ;             Ext.Button.buttonTemplate.compile  ;  [ 140 ]   Chapter 5           }          this.template = Ext.Button.buttonTemplate;       }        var btn, targs = this.getTemplateArgs  ;        if  this.isRendered  {          btn = this.el;              remove class from transformed btn          btn.removeClass 'ux-btn-markup' ;              remove onclick from DOM and make button event          var clickString = btn.getAttribute 'onclick' ;          if  clickString  {             btn.dom.onclick = null;                 config handler overrides onclick attribute             if  !this.handler  {                if  Ext.isIE  {                   eval "this.on 'click', " + clickString +                        " ;" ;                }                else {                   eval "this.on 'click', function  { " +                        clickString + "} ;" ;                }             }          }              assign config text or markup when not specified          if  !this.text  {             this.btnEl = btn.child this.buttonSelector ;             this.text = this.btnEl.dom.innerHTML;          }           btn.child 'tbody' .dom.className = targs[1];              Menu - assign class if specified          if  this.menu && targs[2]  {             btn.child this.arrowSelector .addClass targs[2] ;          }       } else {          if  position  {  [ 141 ]    Much more interesting is looking at an example usage shown in previous screenshot,  and found in chapter05 ex-5-buttons-transform.html:  Chapter 5  Ext.onReady function  {        Page specific code     new Ext.SplitButton {         transformEl: 'P40_APPLY_CHANGES',         id:'P40_APPLY_CHANGES',         iconCls: 'ux-icon-tick',         menu: {                dropdown menu items when the arrow is clicked             items: [{                 text: 'Item 1',                 request:'ITEM1',                 handler: onMenuItemClick             }, {                 text: 'Item 2',                 request:'ITEM2',                 handler: onMenuItemClick             }]         }     } ;      function onMenuItemClick item {           apex.submit item.request ;         Ext.Msg.alert 'Menu Item Click', 'You clicked the "' +           item.text + '" item with request "' +            item.request + '".' ;     } } ;     Application code Ext.onReady function  {        Convert remaining markup buttons to Ext components        assigns id if exists, otherwise Ext will generate     var els = Ext.select "table.ux-btn-markup", true ;     els.each function el {         new Ext.Button {transformEl: el, id:el.dom.id} ;     } ;  } ;  This shows some page-specific code, which is doing the task of transforming the  P40_APPLY_CHANGES button, assigning the same ID to the button component, and  adding an icon and a menu with a function to process the menu items.  [ 143 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  In this example, an icon is added using:          iconCls: 'ux-icon-tick',  Ext assigns the class to the button as part of the transform; you just need to include a  CSS rule specifying the background-image attribute for your image:  .ux-icon-tick {     background-image:url tick-square.gif  !important; }  The !important attribute used here raises the specificity of the CSS rule, ensuring  that this background is used in preference to the Ext-supplied rule.  A menu has also been added to the button using:          menu: {                dropdown menu items when the arrow is clicked             items: [{                 text: 'Item 1',                 request:'ITEM1',                 handler: onMenuItemClick             }, {                 text: 'Item 2',                 request:'ITEM2',                 handler: onMenuItemClick             }]         }  In this case, a separate click-handler function has been assigned to each menu item,  so you could call completely different functions for each item.   Ext also lets you assign default values for the menu, which are applied to every  menu item unless overridden at the menu item level:          menu: {                defaults for all menu items, unless overridden             defaults: {                 handler: doSomethingDifferent             },             items: [{                 text: 'Item 1',                 request:'ITEM1'             }, {                 text: 'Item 2',                 request:'ITEM2',                 handler: onMenuItemClick             }]         }  [ 144 ]   Chapter 5  In this code snippet, Item 1 uses the menu's default click handler to  doSomethingDifferent, whereas Item 2 uses onMenuItemClick.  The onMenuItemClick function is showing an Ext alert, but notice the   commented line:      function onMenuItemClick item {           apex.submit item.request ;         Ext.Msg.alert 'Menu Item Click', 'You clicked the "' +           item.text + '" item with request "' +            item.request + '".' ;     }  Uncommenting this would pick up the standard APEX page submit code, passing a  request matching the menu items request attribute. This is how you would tie your  menu items in to your APEX page processing.  Finally, at the end of the script is the application code:     Application code Ext.onReady function  {        Convert remaining markup buttons to Ext components        assigns id if exists, otherwise Ext will generate     var els = Ext.select "table.ux-btn-markup", true ;     els.each function el {         new Ext.Button {transformEl: el, id:el.dom.id} ;     } ;  } ;  This code would be included in your application JavaScript file and executed after  any page specific scripts. The code converts any buttons using the table-based  template that haven't already been converted—a set and forget feature.  We've spent quite a bit of time looking at buttons. Initially, we saw how to use a  HTML and CSS-only approach using Sliding Doors and CSS Sprites to create your  own custom buttons. We then covered creating a static version of an Ext button as  an APEX template, showing how the button can work without any further changes.  And finally, we looked at how to convert the static Ext button into a fully functioning  button, opening up a range of possibilities that the Ext.Button API offers.  Let's move on to the remaining template types.  [ 145 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  Popup List of Values template The Popup List of Values template controls how the popup list of values items  are displayed in the APEX application for all items of type POPUP. Unlike other  template types, only one popup template is allowed per theme.  The popup template is more restricted than other templates in how you can modify  the layout, but it is still possible to change its appearance to give it an Ext look, and  make some minor functional improvements. The previous screenshot shows the  popup page in use. The header and footer regions use Ext styling, and use fixed CSS  positioning to ensure that both regions are always visible when scrolling large lists.  [ 146 ]   Chapter 5  This wraps a DIV tag around the search field, and assigns an ID to the field, so we  can modify the appearance using CSS.  The template responsible to make this happen is:  Before field text:     Filter text attributes: For pre APEX 4.0, versions only, add the following line:  id="search-item"  In APEX 4.0 this value is automatically included.  After field text:     Pagination result row X of Y:  Row s  FIRST_ROW - LAST_ROW  Before result set:  After result set:          Page body attributes:  onload="first_field  "  Page footer text:     Similarly, wrapping the result set with a DIV tag allows padding to be added using  an inline style attribute. A DIV tag for the bottom toolbar is also added, and the  Pagination Result Row X of Y has all HTML tags removed, leaving just the text.  At this point, all that remains to be done is to add the CSS rules. Because the popup  page has only a few elements to style, rather than linking to an external CSS file, you  can embed the styles directly in the page header instead.  [ 147 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  Page HTML Head:    body {background-color:FFFFFF;margin:0} * {font: normal 12px tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;}  a:link, a:visited, a:active {   font: normal 12px tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;   color: 0464BB;   text-decoration:none; } a:hover {   color: 1C417C;   text-decoration: underline; }  .ux-top-toolbar  {     background-color:D0DEF0;     background:none repeat-x scroll left top transparent;     background-image: url " ux extjs resources images default toolbar  bg.gif" ;     border-color:A9BFD3;     border-style:solid;     display:block;     overflow:hidden;     padding:2px;     width:100%;     border-width:0 0 1px;     left:0;     position:fixed;     top:0; } .ux-btm-toolbar  {     background-color:D0DEF0;     background:none repeat-x scroll left top transparent;     background-image: url " ux extjs resources images default toolbar  bg.gif" ;     border-color:A9BFD3;     border-style:solid;     display:block;     overflow:hidden;     padding:2px;     width:100%;     border-width:1px 0 0;     top:auto;  [ 148 ]   Chapter 5      left:0;     position:fixed;     bottom:0; }  search-item { background-color:FFFFFF; background-image: url " ux extjs resources images default form text- bg.gif" ; border:1px solid B5B8C8; line-height:normal; padding:3px 3px 0; vertical-align:middle; }    The CSS styles the body search item and link elements, as well as uses fixed  positioning to ensure that the top and bottom toolbars remain in position regardless   of scrolling.  Popup List of Values are fine to use, but we will see better alternatives in later  chapters when we look at AJAX-enabled combo boxes.  Breadcrumb templates Breadcrumbs or breadcrumb trails provide a navigation aid to assist in identifying  the user's location in a website. Breadcrumbs typically are used as a secondary  navigation scheme, and appear horizontally near the top of a page, showing the  path taken to reach the current page.  Typical breadcrumbs look like this:  Home page > Section page > Subsection page  There are three types of web breadcrumbs:   	 Path breadcrumbs are dynamic, and show the user the exact steps they have   taken to arrive at their current location.   	 Location breadcrumbs are static, showing where the page is located in the   website hierarchy.   	 Attribute breadcrumbs give information that categorizes the current page,   for example, Electronics > Televisions > Plasma TV.  APEX supports only location and attribute breadcrumbs, because it uses static  hierarchies to define breadcrumbs.  [ 149 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  Benefits of using breadcrumbs Breadcrumbs work well in websites that have a large amount of content organized  in a hierarchical manner, such as e-commerce websites, in which a large variety of  products are grouped into logical categories.  Some of the benefits of using a breadcrumb trail are:   	 Reduced clicks to return to higher-level pages: APEX-generated pages often  use a Cancel or Back button to return to an earlier page. Using breadcrumbs,  users can return to a higher-level page with a single click instead of  navigating back through the pages, saving multiple page loads.   	 Consumption of minimal screen real estate: Typically, breadcrumbs are   horizontally oriented and use plain styling, consuming minimal screen space  and minimal overhead to page content.   	 Alternative uses: Breadcrumbs can be used for specific page groups, such as  wizards or guided tours. The following screenshot shows how Flickr uses a  breadcrumb trail, indicating the number of sections in the Flickr tour:  When not to use breadcrumbs Breadcrumb trails have a linear structure, so using them will be difficult if your  pages can't be classified into neat categories. Deciding whether to use breadcrumbs  largely depends on how you've designed your website hierarchy. If you can navigate  to a lower-level page from more than one location or category, breadcrumb trails are  ineffective, inaccurate, and confusing to the user.  Basic horizontal breadcrumb template The breadcrumb template shown in the next screenshot uses a simple unordered list  and some CSS to define a horizontal breadcrumb trail:  [ 150 ]   Chapter 5  The source for the breadcrumb template is: Start with: Parent to Leaf Before first:         Current page breadcrumb entry:       NAME   Non-current page breadcrumb entry:  After last:               NAME    Maximum Levels: 12 The template is just the minimal markup required to define an unordered list, with  non-current pages containing a link element with a title attribute. The list is wrapped  by a DIV element with a class attribute.   So, the only thing controlling the horizontal layout of the list is the CSS:  .breadcrumb {     color: grey;     display:block;     left:0;     overflow:hidden;     padding:2px;     position:relative;     top:0; } .breadcrumb li {     float: left;     display: inline;     margin-right: 4px; } .breadcrumb a {     color: 222;     background: url  i r_arrow.gif  no-repeat scroll right center;     padding-right: 12px;     text-decoration: none; }  [ 151 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  Using display: inline changes the list from a vertical to a horizontal list.  Everything else is visual styling.  Breadcrumbs are usually contained in a Region template of type "Breadcrumb  Region". As the template defined here is self contained, the region template is   just a wrapper: Template Class: Breadcrumb Region Template:   BODY   Breadcrumbs are simple to implement and effective to use; let's move onto  something a little more challenging in Report templates.  Report templates APEX has two report types, the "Classic Report" and the "Interactive Report".  Classic reports have been in APEX since its inception, and are the formatted result of  the SELECT statement of SQL language. The report templates used to control the layout  of a classic report can either be "Generic Column" or "Named Column" templates. The  main difference being that Generic Column templates render every column using the  same column sub-template, whereas Named Column templates allow you to render  each column differently, but need to define each column in the template.  The overwhelming majority of APEX applications will predominantly use Generic  Column templates, reserving Named Column templates for very specific report  layouts. We will be looking only at the Generic Column Report template in this  chapter, as this will give you the maximum benefit in creating your initial Ext JS theme.  Interactive Reports were first introduced in APEX 3.1, providing the user with the  ability to customize the appearance of the data through a searching, filtering, sorting,  column selection, highlighting, and other data manipulations. They were the "killer  feature" of the APEX 3.1 release, causing both developers and application users to  clamor at managers doors demanding to "Upgrade immediately!".  In APEX 4.0, a whole series of new features have been added to Interactive Reports,  including icon and detail views, the ability to have multiple "saved reports",  e-mailing reports, and more. While all this makes Interactive Reports even more  compelling to use, they don't have templates, so we won't be covering them here.   Another limitation of Interactive Reports is that you are limited to one Interactive  Report per page, leaving a huge hole to be filled by Classic reports.  [ 152 ]   Chapter 5  It's a classic The Ext Grid is one of the most advanced and widely used components of Ext JS.  You can use it to simply display and paginate tabular data using AJAX, edit data  inline, drag–and-drop columns, hide and show columns, have expanding and  collapsing rows, and so on.  In this template we are going to "fake it", using the built-in functionality of an APEX  Classic report and combining it with some CSS, so it looks like a read-only Ext Grid  with AJAX paging.   The following screenshot shows what our report template looks like, sitting inside  a collapsible Report Region template. Notice how some of the elements we have  already covered are all coming together—the report is sitting very nicely within  a collapsible panel, looking very integrated with the panel. The buttons for the  pagination and the CSV download use CSS sprite techniques we also covered earlier  in this chapter.  Create a new report template, populating the fields shown here. Report Template Name: EXTJS Standard Template Class: Standard Before rows:    <table id="report-REGION_STATIC_ID" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"  class="ux-table" REPORT_ATTRIBUTES>  [ 153 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  Before column heading:     Column heading template:  <td id="COLUMN_HEADER_NAME" class="ux-cell-hd x-grid3-header"  ALIGNMENT COLUMN_WIDTH>COLUMN_HEADER   When using a version prior to APEX 4.0, leave out the COLUMN_WIDTH attribute.

It's  really all quite ordinary in fact! If you are using APEX versions earlier than APEX 4.0 for the Column Heading  Template, the COLUMN_WIDTH substitution tag is not available. You can fix column  widths without it anyway, using CSS rules picking up the table ID and column ID.  So for this template, if the region used a static region name of customer and the  column name was first_name you could set the column width using a CSS rule in  the page header:  report-customer first_name {width: 80px}  The After Rows field looks quite complicated, but that's only because APEX insists  on creating the PAGINATION sub-template as a table row, using table cells with  a "pagination" class attribute. To get this to fit into the Ext toolbar markup and  right align the CSV_LINK on the same line, some fancy footwork has been done,  introducing some additional embedded tables as a means to achieving a result. For the Pagination components, starting at After Rows all the way down to Previous  Set Template, two techniques have been repeatedly used to create the pagination  icons and the CSV download icon.  [ 156 ]   For the button outline, the CSS sprite technique discussed at the beginning of the  chapter has been reused, this time with a fixed width image, as all the icons used  are of a known size. Once again the "hover" and "active" appearance for the buttons  have been achieved using the CSS background-image and background-position  properties to display the desired image segment. The following diagram shows the  image used for the button outline:  Chapter 5  The icons for the "next" and "previous" indicators and CSV download use a  transparent image with a fixed size of 16x16 pixels, and a class specifying the CSS  background-image attribute for the icon. For example, the "next" page indicator uses  the following markup for the image:  <img src=" i 1px_trans.gif" width="16px" height="16px"  class="x-tbar- page-prev" >  The x-tbar-page-prev class attribute picks up the Ext CSS rule for the icon:  background-image: url .. images default grid page-prev.gif    .x-tbar-page-prev{   !important; }  It is worth remembering that by using the background-image attribute instead of  directly assigning the image source, you can easily update the image by modifying  the CSS file once, rather than in every place you reference the image source.  [ 157 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports A better sorting indicator For the column-sorting indicator, APEX gives you some predefined choices, and if  you don't like those choices it can be difficult to reference another image.   The reason behind it being difficult is that APEX prefixes whatever image name you  specify in the Ascending Image and Descending Image fields in the Sorting section  of the Report Attributes for a Report Region with  i , and not the IMAGE_PREFIX  substitution tag as you would expect.  Fortunately, among the standard images supplied with APEX in that folder is a   one-pixel transparent image, allowing you to use the CSS background-image  technique to use the transparent image once again, and specify a class to pick up   the image you want to use. The following screenshot shows how to assign the   image and classes:  The CSS for the sorting indicator is:  .ux-sort-asc {     background-image:url  ux extjs resources images default grid sort_ asc.gif ;     background-repeat:no-repeat;     display:inline;     height:4px;     margin-left:3px;     vertical-align:middle;     width:13px; } .ux-sort-desc {     background-image:url  ux extjs resources images default grid sort_ desc.gif ;  [ 158 ]   Chapter 5      background-repeat:no-repeat;     display:inline;     height:4px;     margin-left:3px;     vertical-align:middle;     width:13px; }  CSS for the standard report There is quite a lot of CSS behind this report template, so rather than showing it all  here, I will just refer you to the CSS file located in chapter5 playpen-book.css.  Look for the section under "Reports".  Calendar templates Calendar templates are unusual because they contain multiple layouts within  a single template. Within a Calendar template, there are separate templates for  monthly, weekly, and daily calendars, and in APEX 4.0 there is an additional custom  calendar template.  The calendar we will be creating is shown in the following screenshot. It scales to  the width of the enclosing region, and scales vertically based on the content of the  calendar items. To restrict the size of the calendar, set the enclosing regions width in  the Region Attributes field for the region.  [ 159 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  Create a new Calendar template, name it EXTJS Calendar, and populate the fields for  the Monthly Calendar:          <em style="border-left- width:0">IMONTH YYYY        Month formats: Month title format  Day of week format    IDY    Month open format  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1px" summary="0"  class="x-date-inner">  Month close format       Week formats: Week open format  Week close format        Weekday formats: Day title format   DD   Day open format  Day close format     Today open format        [ 160 ]   Chapter 5     Non-day formats: Non-day title format   DD   Non-day open format  Non-day close format     Weekend formats: Weekend title format   DD   Weekend open format  Weekend close format     The weekly template is:  Month title format  Day of week format  Month open format  Month close format          The weekly and daily calendars are very similar; the main differences to note is the  enclosing DIV element has an additional class attribute—ux-calendar-weekly or  ux-calendar-daily.    <div  class="x-list-header">    <em  style="border-left-width:0">WTITLE          IDY MM DD    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1px" summary="0"  class="x-date-inner">  [ 161 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports        Hour formats Hour open format  Hour close format        Weekday formats: Day open format  Day close format     Today open format  Time formats: Time title format  TIME  Time open format  Time close format              Weekend formats: Weekend open format  Weekend close format  [ 162 ]   Chapter 5  And the Daily Calendar template is:  Month formats: Month title format    <div  class="x-list-header">    <em  style="border-left-width:0">IMONTH DD, YYYY     <  div>    IDAY DD MM    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1px" summary="0"  class="x-date-inner">  Day of week format  Month open format  Month close format       Hour formats: Hour open format  Hour close format        Weekday formats: Day open format  Day close format     Today open format        [ 163 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  Time formats:  Time title format  TIME  Time open format     Time close format     So finally, after three whole chapters, we have created each type of template, and  now have a "minimal" theme. Hooray!! Let's clean up and publish our theme.  Removing unused templates quickly Now is the time to go through your templates deciding, which ones to keep and  which ones aren't needed for the time being. We will temporarily remove all those  we don't need before we publish our APEX theme. Throughout the book, all the  templates have been created using EXTJS as a prefix, making it easy to identify  which ones to keep; hopefully you've done something similar. In Chapter 1, Setting up an Oracle APEX and Ext JS Environment, two APEX utilities  included in the source were mentioned—the APEXExport and APEXExportSplitter  Java classes located in the Oracle APEX distribution in utilities oracle apex  directory. At the time we set up a batch script to run the APEXExport utility. We are  now going to make use of the APEXExportSplitter. First, export your theme from Application Builder  Export, as shown in the  following screenshot:   [ 164 ]   Chapter 5  Save the file onto your computer and copy it to a second file, which I'll name   theme.sql here.  From the command prompt, you then need to set your Java CLASSPATH and run  the APEXExportSplitter. I'm doing it here from a DOS prompt; Unix users will need  to adjust accordingly. If you're using database 11g, set the CLASSPATH to ojdbc6.jar.  set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%; \ojdbc6.jar  For database 10g, set the CLASSPATH to classes12.jar.  set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%; \classes12.jar  Also, set the CLASSPATH to include the utilities directory containing the  APEXExportSplitter.  set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%; \utilities  Now you can run the splitter.  In case of my local environment:  set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;C:\playpen\oracle\instantclient_10_2\ classes12.jar set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;C:\playpen\oracle\utilities  java oracle.apex.APEXExportSplitter theme.sql  This splits the file into the individual components in subfolders, as shown in the  following screenshot:   [ 165 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  Locate the install.sql file in the top folder and edit it, commenting out all the  unwanted templates. I've modified the text replacing shared_components user_ interface templates with … in following code for layout purposes. You simply  need to comment out the lines containing unwanted templates.  Now, if you run the install.sql script from a SQL*Plus session as the database  user for your APEX workspace, the theme will be deleted and recreated with just the  uncommented components.  If you missed a file or two, you can edit and rerun this script as often as you like.  Publishing your theme You are now in a position to publish your "minimal" theme. At this point you have  at least one template for each of the template types  breadcrumb, button, calendar,  label, list, page, popup list of values, region, and report , but lack templates for every  template class within each template type.  Publishing a theme takes a copy of your theme and stores it in the theme repository  for the workspace. The published theme cannot be edited directly; to modify it you  need to create an application with the theme, modify it, and then publish it to the  theme repository.   Having a TEMPLATE application, where you keep the current version of your theme  within your workspace, is a really good idea. Apart from having the latest copy on  hand, it also lends weight to the argument if you have a policy of no changes to be  made to templates within an application without thorough testing. By ensuring that  template changes are made in your TEMPLATE application, you can have all your  use cases and developer usage documentation in a tidy little bundle—also useful  when bringing in new people to your team.  [ 166 ]   The actual process of publishing a theme is very simple. From within Application  Builder, navigate to Shared Components  Themes  Manage Workspace   Themes. From there, you step through a simple wizard to publish your theme.   The following screenshot shows the most complicated step—coming up with   a name for your theme!  Chapter 5  APEX Instance Administrators can publish your theme as a public theme. Public  themes are available to all workspaces. Generally, it's advisable to have templates  for each of the template types, as well as each of the classes within each type, before  making a theme public.  Summary In this chapter, we had a good long look at buttons, creating a custom markup  button using the sliding doors method to provide horizontal scalability, and creating  multiple states by applying different background images contained in a sprite image.   We then integrated the "horrible" Ext button, starting out using static markup,  showing how the button can work without any further changes. After that we  converted the static Ext button into a fully functioning button, opening up a range   of possibilities that the Ext.Button API offers, including transforming it to include  drop-down menus and icons.  Popup list of values and breadcrumbs were covered next, tweaking the template  types to create the Ext look, with some simple changes.  [ 167 ]   Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports  The Classic report template was then given a makeover, "faking it" so it looks   and behaves like a basic Ext Grid, using the built-in APEX functionality. The   report template demonstrated how some of the earlier templates and techniques  covered are all coming together, with the report working very nicely within a  collapsible panel.   The Calendar template was covered next, once again adding some visual polish   to an already functional APEX component.  You saw how to delete all the unwanted templates quickly from the APEX theme  using the APEXExportSplitter Java class, and discussed the process of publishing   the theme.   Also pointed out are the benefits of maintaining a TEMPLATE application, providing  a place to modify your theme templates, and also have all your use cases and  developer usage documentation in a tidy little bundle.  Now have our working theme up and running. The next chapter starts introducing  some Ext widgets into our application.  [ 168 ]   Adding Ext Layout Elements  In consulting circles the term "low-hanging fruit" is often used to describe   quick-win solutions, where a minor change significantly improves some aspect   of an application with a broad impact across the entire application.  Consultants and developers in general love "low-hanging fruit" solutions because  they are easy to reach, and help keep the forward momentum of a project going.  With estimating task complexity and duration in software development not being an  exact science, some activities take far longer than originally estimated while others  come in well under time. Having a few "low-hanging fruit" solutions available means  you can smooth out some of the overruns and buy some time by reporting "feature  X was held back this release because we implemented feature Y across the entire  application".  Having said that, the term evokes visual imagery of fruit-laden trees and ironically  in orchards, picking the low-hanging fruit first is the worst thing to do. Experienced  pickers start at the top of the tree where the fruit is ripest. Starting at the top makes  the job easier, as you rest the bag, which is around your neck and shoulders on the  ladder. You fill as you go down, so the bag is full when you get to the bottom.  In this chapter, we will cover the following "low-hanging fruit":   	 Converting APEX Classic dates to the Ext.DatePicker  	 Making all text areas resizable, or better still, auto-sizing  	 Transforming select lists to auto-completing combo boxes  	 Building tab panels using subregions  	 Building toolbars and menus   Adding Ext Layout Elements  Speed dating with a Date Picker In versions prior to APEX 4.0, the Date Picker component displays a text field with a  calendar icon next to it. When clicked, the icon displays a small calendar in a pop-up  window as a separate page request. Selecting a date passes back the value to the text  field, and closes the pop-up window. This date picker still exists in APEX 4.0, as the  Date Picker  Classic , shown on the left of the following screenshot:  The Ext alternative to this classic date picker is the Ext.DatePicker, a highly  configurable component, which dynamically constructs a calendar within the page  when the icon is clicked. It also allows you to rapidly scroll through months and  years using keyboard shortcuts; it also features auto-complete functionality, allowing  you to type partial dates or use alternative date formats, which are automatically  converted when you tab out of the field.  In APEX 4.0, the Date Picker item type uses the jQuery UI Datepicker as the  replacement for the Date Picker  Classic . It offers similar functionality to the Ext. DatePicker component, rendering a calendar dynamically within the page and uses  keyboard shortcuts to rapidly scroll through months and years.  It comes with the added advantage that as a native APEX item, it has a number of  settings that can be applied declaratively by the developer, as can be seen in the  following screenshot:  [ 170 ]   Chapter 6  Applications upgrading to APEX 4.0 can easily upgrade Date Picker  Classic   items to the new Date Picker using the Application Builder  Utilities  Upgrade  Application  "Upgrade Date Picker  Classic  to new Date Picker" interface. For APEX versions prior to APEX 4.0, the Ext.DatePicker makes very good sense to  use in preference to the Date Picker  Classic , whereas in APEX 4.0, the new Date  Picker offers similar functionality with better declarative support.  So, if you're currently using a version prior to APEX 4.0, converting to the Ext. DatePicker is very worthwhile. The conversion approach simply adds a little generic  JavaScript to the application, resulting in minimal effort to add, and minimal effort to  remove. When you eventually upgrade to APEX 4.0, you can decide whether or not  to switch to the new APEX Date Picker.  For new applications in APEX 4.0, unless you're hell-bent on using the Ext. DatePicker and write an APEX plugin to give you similar declarative functionality,  the APEX Date Picker is the way to go. If you like the look of the date item, you can  duplicate it using CSS anyway, as I've done in the previous screenshot and in the  included playpen-book.css file.  Converting Classic Dates to the Ext. DatePicker The technique described will convert all Classic Dates to use the Ext.DatePicker, so  we are making the assumption that you use the same date format for all your dates in  your application. Usually this is done by setting the Application Date Format, found  in Application Builder under Shared Components  Globalization Attributes.  [ 171 ]   Adding Ext Layout Elements  For most applications, this is a reasonable assumption, but if you're using multiple  date formats, you can alter the code to include or exclude items with a specific class  only, which you assign to individual date items in the HTML form element attributes.  Classic Dates are rendered in a HTML table like this:   <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" id="P80_DATE_PICKER_ holder" summary="" class="datepicker">         <input type="hidden" value="3813216463288336"    name="p_arg_names">   <input type="text" id="P80_DATE_PICKER" value="23-Mar-2010"     maxlength="2000" size="12" name="p_t08">       <a href="JavaScript:void $p_DatePicker       'P80_DATE_PICKER','0',      'DD-Mon-YYYY','666666','','','','','2010',      'en-us','N','103',      '1038420889063720','06','210'  ;">   <img align="absmiddle" alt="Calendar" src=" i asfdcldr.gif"       id="P80_DATE_PICKER_IMG">              The key points to note here is that the date is rendered in a table with  class="datepicker", and the input item holding the date is in the first TD element,  and the icon is in the second TD element.  To use the Ext.DatePicker, you would include the following code in your application  JavaScript file:  Ext.onReady function  {     var els = Ext.select "table.datepicker", true ;      els.each function el {           remove the datepicker class, to remove any styling        el.removeClass 'datepicker' ;        Ext.fly el .child '.datepicker' .removeClass 'datepicker' ;  [ 172 ]   Chapter 6            remove the icon's table cell        el.select 'td:even' .remove  ;            retrieve the date item as a dom node        var dt = Ext.fly el .child 'input[type=text]', true ;            convert to date        new Ext.form.DateField {             id: dt.id,             applyTo: dt,             "format": 'd-M-Y',             "altFormats": 'jj nj n yj n Yj-Mj-M-yj-M-Y'         } ;     }  } ;  The code starts out by parsing the DOM, retrieving any tables with the  class="datepicker" attribute, and saving the results in an array els. Each table is  then processed in a loop:      var els = Ext.select "table.datepicker", true ;      els.each function el {            process each datepicker...     }   Within the loop, each datepicker table is modified, removing the datepicker class  from the table and any child elements:            remove the datepicker class, to remove any styling        el.removeClass 'datepicker' ;        Ext.fly el .child '.datepicker' .removeClass 'datepicker' ;            remove the icon's table cell        el.select 'td:even' .remove  ;  Then the input item is selected and converted to an Ext.DatePicker; the item name  and values are retained as part of the conversion:            retrieve the date item as a dom node        var dt = Ext.fly el .child 'input[type=text]', true ;            convert to date        new Ext.form.DateField {             id: dt.id,             applyTo: dt,             "format": 'd-M-Y',             "altFormats": 'jj nj n yj n Yj-Mj-M-yj-M-Y'         } ;  [ 173 ]   Adding Ext Layout Elements  The database date format I'm using is DD-Mon-YYYY, which corresponds to the Ext  date format d-M-Y. For a complete list of format masks available, consult the Ext  documentation at http:  www.extjs.com deploy dev docs ?class=Date.  The "altFormats" attribute shown in the preceding code snippet includes a number  of alternative formats, which can be used for data entry. So, for example, typing 1  and then tabbing out of the date would automatically be converted to the first day of  the current month and year. Similarly, typing 1 3 would convert to the first of March  for the current year.  If you prefer the format DD-MON-YYYY for your dates, it's not available using the date  formats listed for Ext, but can be done by overriding the default Ext date names with  the following line of JavaScript at the beginning of your application JavaScript file:  Date.monthNames =["JANUARY","FEBRUARY","MARCH","APRIL","MAY",  "JUNE","JULY","AUGUST","SEPTEMBER","OCTOBER","NOVEMBER",  "DECEMBER"];  This is the Ext way of internationalizing dates, so it's fully supported, and forces the  JavaScript date format "d-M-Y" to return the month in uppercase.  So there you have it, a simple "drop in" solution that you can incorporate into  existing pre-APEX 4.0 applications and give them enhanced functionality. The more  interesting question is once you have moved to APEX 4.0, are you going to keep the  Ext DatePicker, or switch to the APEX jQuery version?  Resizable text areas In APEX 4.0, text areas have a resizable option, when enabled allowing users to  resize text areas, so they can see all the text. I'm sure you're already too familiar with  how frustrating it is using the APEX Builder when you're trying to edit code in a text  area much smaller than your code.  As developers, we normally have local administration rights on our computers, so  it's very easy to overcome this issue by using a browser add-on, such as the Firefox  "Text Area Resizer and Mover", available at https:  addons.mozilla.org en-US  firefox addon 8287. Our corporate users aren't usually so lucky, with locked- down computers, so they can't alter their set up.  The following screenshot shows the Ext version of the resizable text area   compared with the APEX 4.0 resizable text area—quite similar visually, and   provides similar functionality.  [ 174 ]   Chapter 6  The Google browser has similar functionality built into the browser, making all text  areas resizable. I believe this is a very sensible approach; after all, why should only  some text areas be resizable?  To convert your text areas, just include the following code in your application  JavaScript:  Ext.onReady function   {   var els=Ext.select "textarea",true ;   els.each function el {     new Ext.Resizable el, {         wrap:true,         pinned:true,         handles: 's',         width:el.getWidth  ,         height:el.getHeight  ,         minWidth:el.getWidth  ,         minHeight: el.getHeight       } ;   }  } ;  The script finds all text area elements on the page, and then applies the Ext. Resizable class to the element. This applies drag handles to the element to make it  resizable, the original text area remains unchanged—very handy if you have enabled  the character counter on a text area!  As usual, Ext provides a number of configuration options, allowing you to set which  handles to include, either 'all' or any of 'n s e w ne nw se sw', whether the handles  "pinned" to ensure they are always visible, or only visible when the user mouses over  the resizable borders, or transparent so the handles don't appear at all.  [ 175 ]               Adding Ext Layout Elements  The Ext.Resizable class can be used on more than just text areas; resizable   images are very effective also. In the examples provided with the Ext JS SDK   library, the examples resizable basic.html file demonstrates the full range of  options available, including options such as animated transitions, preserved ratios,  and snapping.  Auto-sizing text areas Having implemented resizable text areas over three years ago in some APEX  applications, my application users take this feature very much for granted. So much  so, that they started to complain about having to resize the text area every time they  visited a page to see the full content.  If like my users, you spend your entire day in an application racking up over 2000  page hits individually, you can understand how something little like this really starts  to be too much effort for a minor detail.  Having scoured the Internet looking for a solution at the time, it appears Facebook  was the first website to introduce an auto-growing text area that gets bigger as you  type into it. After spending some time looking at some of the different solutions  available, I cobbled together a solution for Ext using techniques borrowed from other  people's great ideas.  Now you don't have to, it's a configuration option in the Ext.form.TextArea  To make all your text areas automatically grow, add the following code to your  application JavaScript:  Ext.onReady function   {   var els=Ext.select "textarea",true ;   els.each function el {       new Ext.form.TextArea {           applyTo: el,           grow: true,           width: el.getWidth         } ;   }  } ;  [ 176 ]  Setting the width configuration option retains the original width of the text area.   Chapter 6  To limit the size of your text areas, Ext.form.TextArea includes configuration options  growMax to set maximum height to allow when grow=true  defaults to 1000 , and  growMin to set the minimum height to allow when grow=true  defaults to 60 .  No more messing about with grab handles to resize your text boxes; they are always  sized to the content. Now my users are happy, for a little while.  Auto-completing text fields The Ext.Combo provides an alternative to the text field with auto-complete item  type, which was introduced in APEX 4.0. The text field with auto complete item type  shows a list of possible values when the user starts typing in the field, progressively  filtering the data as more keys are typed.  The following screenshot shows an example of the text field with auto-complete  item type displaying a list of countries, with the field on the right showing that the  additional character has further reduced the list of matching values.  The values are based on the defined List of Values  LOV  SQL statement returning a  single column, for example:  SELECT country_name   FROM countries  ORDER BY country_name  As the text field with auto-complete item type does not prevent additional values  not already in the LOV SQL statement being entered, it is your responsibility as the  developer to determine how existing and new values are processed.  Assume we are processing a purchase order  PO  record in the PURCHASE_ORDERS  table, and currently looking up the country names from the COUNTRIES table using  the earlier query.  [ 177 ]   Adding Ext Layout Elements  Consider the following options for the country field from the preceding screenshot  when the page is submitted to the APEX engine for processing:  Use Case Existing value entered, country stored  Action Verify existing country.  Existing value entered, country ID stored  New value entered, country stored  Process PO record. Fetch country ID using country name.  Process PO record. Verify existing country => NOT FOUND.  New values for country are allowed  Add country to COUNTRIES table.  New value entered, country ID stored  New values for country are allowed  Change LOV SQL to query PO table  New value entered, country stored  New values for country are allowed  Process PO record. Fetch country ID using country name =>  NOT FOUND.  Add country to COUNTRIES table,  returning country ID.  Process PO record. Process PO record.  Looking at the Use Cases, it becomes evident that most of the time you need to do  additional validation and processing for the text field with auto complete item type. If it  is used as a free-text field, which accepts any input, including new values not already  in the LOV SQL statement, then this is an appropriate choice.  For most applications, this is a less common scenario, much more typically you  want to limit allowable values for an item to a pre-determined set, only allowing  additional values to be added through administration forms by privileged users,   if at all.  For this typical lookup scenario, the humble select list is appropriate for relatively  short lists of values, and the Popup LOV item type for longer lists. In fact, for the  internal APEX applications, which make up the APEX Application Builder, the select  list is by far the most commonly used input item, being used for roughly 25% of all  input items.  [ 178 ]   Select Lists have a display value and a returned value for each option.  Continuing our purchase order example for the country field, the values could be  based on the defined LOV SQL statement:  Chapter 6  SELECT country_name d       ,id r   FROM countries   ORDER BY country_name  The APEX engine would generate HTML markup for the select list as:       Afghanistan     Aland Islands     Albania, Republic of               Yemen     Zambia, Republic of     Zimbabwe      The results in a user-friendly country description displayed to the user, and the ID  value returned when the page is submitted. Looking at the highlighted code, the  displayed value is Yemen and the returned value is 117.  The Action for our earlier Use Cases when the APEX engine processes the page is  simply "Process PO record", because we have the value we wish to store.  Select lists are very useful for limiting inputs to a set of allowable values, but   don't have auto-complete functionality. This is where the Ext.form.ComboBox   comes into play.  Adding auto-complete to select lists The Ext.form.ComboBox can be used as a direct replacement for the HTML select list.  It provides the same drop-down list of values, as well as auto-completing filtering  functionality, enabling users to find and select a value quickly.  [ 179 ]   Adding Ext Layout Elements  The following screenshot shows a select list with a large set of values, and a   combo box showing the same set of values filtered on the first 3 characters using   the auto-complete functionality.  To convert select lists without an onchange attribute to combo boxes is very simple:  Ext.onReady function   {     var els=Ext.select "select[multiple!='multiple']",true ;     els.each function el {         new Ext.form.ComboBox {             id: 'cb-'+el.id,             hiddenId: el.id,             disabled: el.dom.disabled,             typeAhead: true,             triggerAction: 'all',             transform:el,             width:el.getWidth  ,             forceSelection:true         } ;     }  } ;  [ 180 ]   Chapter 6  Once again we are using the Ext.select function to retrieve all single-line select  lists. All of the work to convert each select list into a combo box is done using the  highlighted transform configuration option to identify the select list. The other  configuration options define the behavior we want for the combo box.  However, we have only solved part of the problem!  The APEX 4.0 Application Builder has five different page actions when a select list  item type is changed, as shown in the following screenshot:  Apart from the "None  Default " option, each of the options adds an onchange  attribute to the HTML markup for the select list.  For example, the APEX engine would generate HTML markup for the Submit page  select list as:  <select class="selectlist" onchange="apex.submit 'P90_SL_SUBMIT' ;" size="1" id="P90_SL_SUBMIT" name="p_t05">    Afghanistan     Aland Islands     Albania, Republic of               Yemen     Zambia, Republic of     Zimbabwe      [ 181 ]   The following table shows an example of the onchange HTML markup for   each option:  Adding Ext Layout Elements  Option None  Default  Submit Page Redirect and Set Value  Redirect to Page  based  on selected value   Redirect to URL  based  on selected value   onchange  apex.submit 'P90_SL_SUBMIT' ; location.href='f?p=103:90:2624308855119166::NO::  P90_SL_REDIRECT:'+  this.options[selectedIndex].value; location.href='f?p=103:'+this.options[selectedIndex].value+  ':2624308855119166::NO'; location.href=this.options[selectedIndex].value;  The auto-sizing text area we modified previously simply adds JavaScript events to  the existing DOM element, so existing onchange attributes and existing JavaScript  events are retained.   When the select list is transformed to a Ext.form.ComboBox, the JavaScript code  creates new DOM elements to make up the Ext.form.ComboBox, and then deletes   the select list DOM element together with its onchange attributes.  To convert select lists including logic from onchange attributes to combo boxes:  Ext.onReady function   {   var els=Ext.select "select[multiple!='multiple']",true ;   els.each function el {        save attribute as a string     var attr = el.dom.getAttribute 'onchange' ;      if  attr && attr.indexOf 'this.options[selectedIndex].value'  !=   -1   {           replace Select List logic with ComboBox equivalent        attr = attr.replace 'this.options[selectedIndex].value',   'this.getValue  ' ;      }         transform Select List to ComboBox     var cb = new Ext.form.ComboBox {       id: 'cb-'+el.id,       hiddenId: el.id,       disabled: el.dom.disabled,       typeAhead: true,       triggerAction: 'all',       transform:el,  [ 182 ]   Chapter 6        width:el.getWidth  ,       forceSelection:true     } ;         add on select event     if  attr  {       eval  "cb.on 'select', function  { " + attr + "} ;"  ;     }   }  } ;  Looking at the highlighted code, we first save the value of the onchange  attribute into a variable and then replace any instance of the string 'this. options[selectedIndex].value' with 'this.getValue  ':      if  attr && attr.indexOf 'this.options[selectedIndex].value'  !=       -1   {          replace Select List logic with ComboBox equivalent       attr = attr.replace 'this.options[selectedIndex].value',         'this.getValue  ' ;     }  Replacing the string changes the logic to fetch the selected value within the select list  with its Ext equivalent to fetch the selected value for the combo box.  Once we transform the select list into a combo box, we then conditionally add a  listener that executes a function when the 'select' event is fired:         add on select listener     if  attr  {       eval  "cb.on 'select', function  { " + attr + "} ;"  ;     }  The listener is added using the JavaScript eval command, which evaluates the  concatenated string and executes the statement.  For example, from the earlier table for the redirect to URL option, the onchange  attribute value was originally location.href=this.options[selectedIndex]. value;, which was modified to the string location.href=this.getValue  ;.  The string was then concatenated into the statement cb.on 'select', function   {location.href=this.getValue  ;} ;, which was finally executed to add a select  listener to the combo box.  Hopefully, I haven't lost you in all the detail. We now are able to transform select  lists, including those with onchange attributes, into combo boxes. Are we done yet?  [ 183 ]   Adding Ext Layout Elements  No, we're still not done! There's one more thing to take into account.  For pre-APEX 4.0 versions, we have covered all the out-of-the-box scenarios, so  unless you have written custom JavaScript, you are reasonably safe. However,   APEX 4.0 introduced new functionality, such as cascading select lists and dynamic  actions, resulting in far more JavaScript based interaction between different   elements on the page.  Consequently, there will be some circumstances where you don't want to convert  specific select lists. A simple way to manage this is by adding a class to the select list,  and coding to not transform select lists with this class.  In the following screenshot, the class attribute has been added with the noTransform  class, along with another class in the HTML form element attributes field for a select  list page item within the APEX Application Builder.  Finally, a check is added to the code to skip select lists with the noTransform class:  Ext.onReady function   {   var els=Ext.select "select[multiple!='multiple']",true ;   els.each function el {     if  !el.hasClass 'noTransform'   {          save attribute as a string       var attr = el.dom.getAttribute 'onchange' ;       if  attr && attr.indexOf 'this.options[selectedIndex].value'  !=  -1   {            replace Select List logic with ComboBox equivalent  [ 184 ]           attr = attr.replace 'this.options[selectedIndex].value', 'this.getValue  ' ;       }  Chapter 6           transform Select List to ComboBox       var cb = new Ext.form.ComboBox {         id: 'cb-'+el.id,         hiddenId: el.id,         disabled: el.dom.disabled,         typeAhead: true,         triggerAction: 'all',         transform:el,         width:el.getWidth  ,         forceSelection:true       } ;           add on select event       if  attr  {         eval  "cb.on 'select', function  { " + attr + "} ;"  ;       }     }   }  } ;  So at last, we now have a complete solution, which can be dropped into your  Application JavaScript.  Building tab panels using subregions APEX 4.0 introduced subregions, allowing regions to be nested within other   regions in a parent-child relationship. This provides display opportunities, such  as breaking up large forms into a series of separate sections while still maintaining  visual coherence.  [ 185 ]    Using the un-structured markup approach, the JavaScript shown:  Chapter 6  Ext.onReady function  {     new Ext.TabPanel {         renderTo: 'my-tabs',         activeTab: 0,         items:[             {contentEl:'tab1', title:'Tab 1'},             {contentEl:'tab2', title:'Tab 2'}         ]     } ; } ;  would convert this markup into a tab panel:      A simple tab   Another one   Adding the class "x-hide-display" to each of the DIVs stops them from being  displayed outside the tabs, and reduces your page content from jumping around  when it's being rendered and then manipulated by the page JavaScript. Ext uses this  same class to hide or show the tab panels.  Building the tab panel template The easiest approach to building the template is to start by constructing a page with  some nested subregions, and building a solution from there. This way, you can check  your progress as you go.  Start off by creating a simple page with several regions, with one for the tab panel;  assign the others as subregions of the tab panel. Assigning a region as a subregion is  done in Application Builder by setting the parent region attribute, as shown in the  following screenshot:  You don't need to assign a template to the subregions for this solution. If you do,   it will change the appearance for the content of the individual tab, but not the tab  panel itself.  [ 187 ]   Adding Ext Layout Elements  The following screenshot shows the Application Builder view of the tab panel  example shown earlier:  Within the Maintain User Details region are some region buttons and a tab panel  region as a subregion. The tab panel region in turn contains five subregions and  some items within those regions.  No items are included in the tab panel, as the template we are creating is designed  simply to be a container for the panels within.  Next, create a new region template with the following properties:  Name:  EXTJS TabPanel  [ 188 ]   Chapter 6  Template class:  Custom 1  Template:     SUB_REGIONS SUB_REGION_HEADERS  For the subregion elements: Header template:    Ext.onReady function  {    var subs = []; ENTRIES     new Ext.TabPanel {       renderTo: 'REGION_STATIC_ID',       activeTab: 0,       items:subs    } ; } ;    Header entry template:     subs.push {       contentEl:'SUB_REGION_ID-tab',       title:'SUB_REGION_TITLE'    } ;  Subregion template:    SUB_REGION    Rather than my explaining the code we have just added to the template immediately,  you should assign the template to the tab panel region in the test form you created  earlier. Then run the page to view the output. Did it look like what you expected?  [ 189 ]    Chapter 6  Subregion header entry templates can be used to construct a list of region titles of all  the subregions for the current region. We are adding our own twist by constructing  JavaScript instead of HTML. The command is pushing an object literal onto an array,  the object literal containing the name of the DIV we wrapped around each subregion,  together with the subregion title. This is done by using the SUB_REGION_ID and  SUB_REGION_TITLE substitution tags. Header template:    Ext.onReady function  {    var subs = []; ENTRIES     new Ext.TabPanel {       renderTo: 'REGION_STATIC_ID',       activeTab: 0,       items:subs    } ; } ;    The subregion header template is mainly used to assemble the accumulated results  from the header entry template in the ENTRIES substitution tag.  Also included here is the JavaScript to create the Ext.TabPanel, which is rendered  into the DIV in the template using the ID generated from the REGION_STATIC_ ID substitution tag. This time the pre tags have been replaced with the script tags. Template:     SUB_REGIONS SUB_REGION_HEADERS  The template is a simple DIV element the Ext.TabPanel will be rendered into. The  REGION_STATIC_ID is used to identify the region; the REGION_ATTRIBUTES  allows attributes to be assigned from the Edit Region Form. This is very useful for  sizing the DIV region, for example style="width:595px; height:240px".  The SUB_REGIONS and SUB_REGION_HEADERS are used to hold the content of the  subregions and the JavaScript we have created in the subregion header template.  Now that the script tags are in place, the tab panel will render properly using the  minimal configuration we provided.  [ 191 ]   Adding Ext Layout Elements  Configuring the tab panel template The Ext.TabPanel is highly configurable; so far we have used a minimal  configuration when creating the tab panel in the template definition.  Our minimal configuration means the individual tab panel's size to their   contents. Looking at the following screenshot, you can see the height of the  User Information tab is much larger than the empty History tab shown below it.  Depending on your requirements, that may be perfectly fine. Let's look at a couple   of alternative configurations.  Setting the tab panel's attributes value to style="width:450px; height:240px", as  shown in the following screenshot, controls the height and width of the containing DIV  the tab panel is rendered into through the REGION_ATTRIBUTES substitution tag:  [ 192 ]   This automatically limits the width of the tab panel, which sizes to the parent  container. Using the following configuration allows the height of the individual tabs  to be set to the same value:  Chapter 6  new Ext.TabPanel {    renderTo: 'REGION_STATIC_ID',    activeTab: 0,    height: Ext.fly 'REGION_STATIC_ID' .getHeight  'auto',    defaults: {autoScroll:true, boxMinHeight: 100},    cls: 'blue-tabs',    plain: true,    items:subs } ;  The height config option is set to the height of the containing DIV if specified,  otherwise falls back to the 'auto' setting and uses the height of the tabs contents.  The defaults config option sets all tabs to include a scrollbar automatically if the  content overflows the fixed tab region instead of clipping the content, and specifying  boxMinHeight sets a minimum height if the 'auto' setting is applied.  Adding cls: 'blue-tabs' picks up the custom CSS style:  .blue-tabs .x-panel-bwrap .x-panel-body {     background-color:e0ecfc; padding:10px }  Setting plain: true removes the background from the tab strip. The result of   all these configuration options is the very different looking tab panel in the   following screenshot:              [ 193 ]   Adding Ext Layout Elements  Flipping the tab strip from the top of the tab panel to the bottom is done by simply  setting the configuration option tabPosition: 'bottom'; the result is shown in the  following screenshot:  There are still a large number of configuration options we haven't explored here,  so it's well worth spending some time experimenting to work out what suits your  application best.  Toolbars and menus Back in Chapter 4, Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and Lists, we went through a solution  to creating a hierarchical tree component using a list template to build a script and  generate an Ext.tree.TreePanel, as shown on the left-hand side of the following figure:  [ 194 ]   This time we are going to use much the same approach to produce the toolbar on the  right hand side of the preceding figure. One thing really nice about this solution is  that the tree and toolbar are using the same list as the data source. As the solution is so similar to the Ext.tree.TreePanel solution in Chapter 4, we will  only cover the APEX 4.0 solution. If you are still using an earlier APEX version, you  can easily adapt the pre APEX 4.0 solution in Chapter 4 in the same manner.  Chapter 6  Create a new List Template:  Name: EXTJS Toolbar List Template class: Hierarchical Expanding List template current:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID","text":"TEXT","href":"LINK"A02}  List template current with sub list items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID","text":"TEXT","href":"LINK"A02,menu:{ items:[  List template noncurrent:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID","text":"TEXT","href":"LINK"A02}  List template noncurrent with sub list items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID","text":"TEXT","href":"LINK"A02,menu:{ items:[  Between list elements:  ,  List template current  first :       Ext.onReady function  {   var menuRegion = 'menuLIST_ITEM_ID';    var menuData = [{id:"LIST_ITEM_ID","text":"TEXT",  "href":"LINK"A02,menu:{ items:[  [ 195 ]   Adding Ext Layout Elements  List template current with sublist items  first :       Ext.onReady function  {   var menuRegion = 'menuLIST_ITEM_ID';    var menuData = [{id:"LIST_ITEM_ID","text":"TEXT",  "href":"LINK"A02}  List template noncurrent  first :       Ext.onReady function  {   var menuRegion = 'menuLIST_ITEM_ID';    var menuData = [{id:"LIST_ITEM_ID","text":"TEXT",  "href":"LINK"A02}  List template noncurrent with sublist items  first :       Ext.onReady function  {   var menuRegion = 'menuLIST_ITEM_ID';    var menuData = [{id:"LIST_ITEM_ID","text":"TEXT",  "href":"LINK"A02,menu:{  items:[  Sublist template current:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID","text":"TEXT","href":"LINK"A02}  Sublist template current with sublist items:  {id:"LIST_ITEM_ID","text":"TEXT", "href":"LINK"A02,menu:{ items:[  [ 196 ]    Adding Ext Layout Elements  Attaching the toolbar to the center panel If you want to integrate the toolbar into the center panel so it is directly attached to  the header of the center panel, as shown in the following screenshot, there are a few  simple changes to make:  First, you will need to change your page template to include an empty toolbar in the  center region. This is necessary because Ext cannot add a toolbar to a panel once it  has been rendered.  So, for a simplified Viewport, the highlighted line adds a hidden toolbar to the   center panel:      new Ext.Viewport {         layout: 'border',         defaults: {             animCollapse: false,             autoScroll: true         },         items: [{             contentEl: 'app-west-panel',             collapsible: true,             region: 'west',             split: true,             title: 'Navigation',             width: 275         }, {             id: 'gen-center-panel',             contentEl: 'app-center-panel',             region: 'center',             title: document.title,             tbar: {hidden:true, items:[]},             xtype: 'panel'         }]     } ;    } ;  [ 198 ]   The other item to note is that we have set the ID 'gen-center-panel' for the center  panel, making it easy to reference later.  Then either copy or modify the toolbar list template, changing the following section:  Chapter 6  List template after rows:  ];  var tb = Ext.getCmp 'gen-center-panel' .getTopToolbar  ;  tb.add menuData ; if  !tb.isVisible    tb.setVisible true ; tb.doLayout  ; } ;    Now, instead of rendering the toolbar to a DIV element, we are looking up the  existing toolbar using the ID of the center panel. Once we have this, the menu items  in the array menuData are added to the toolbar. Finally, we set the toolbar to visible  and update the layout.  The references to the DIV element the menu was originally rendered into can also be  removed from the template.  We have barely scratched the surface of what you can do with the Ext.toolbar here.  There are many more features and options available, so spend some time exploring  the toolbar examples included with the Ext library.  Summary In this chapter, we have introduced some "low-hanging fruit" Ext JS components that  add functionality to applications with minimal effort to set them up.  For the date picker, resizable or auto-sizing text areas, and the combo boxes, we have  simply improved existing HTML components. The tab panels and toolbar menus  introduce new functionality not previously available in our theme.  In some ways, using the template approach is ultimately limited, because you   are restricted to hard-coding your configuration options into the template. We   saw for the tab panels to have several different variations requires you to have  multiple templates.  Plugins, also introduced in APEX 4.0, offer much more flexibility, which we will see  in the next chapter.  [ 199 ]    Working with Plug-ins and  Dynamic Actions  Plug-ins and dynamic actions are the two most exciting new features for developers  in APEX 4.0. Combining them with Ext JS components is a recipe for success.  For the first time we now have the ability to add custom "widgets" directly into  APEX that can be used declaratively in the same way as native APEX components.  Plug-ins and dynamic actions are supported with back end integration, allowing  developers to make use of APEX provided PL SQL APIs to simplify component  development.  Plug-ins give developers a supported mechanism to enhance the existing built-in  functionality by writing custom PL SQL components for item types, regions,   and processes.  Dynamic actions provide developers with a way to define client-side behavior  declaratively without needing to know JavaScript. Using a simple wizard,  developers can select a page item and a condition, enter a value, and select an action   for example, Show, Hide, Enable, and Show Item Row .  Most APEX developers come from a database development background. So, they are  much more comfortable coding with PL SQL than JavaScript. The sooner work is  focused on PL SQL development the more productive APEX developers become.  The ability to create plug-ins that can be used declaratively means developers don't  have to write page-specific JavaScript for items on a page, or use messy "hacks" to  attach additional JavaScript functionality to standard APEX items.  Ext JS provides a rich library of sophisticated JavaScript components just waiting to  be integrated into APEX using plug-ins.   Working with Plug-ins and Dynamic Actions  Over the next chapters, we will be looking at plug-ins and dynamic actions and how  they interact together. This chapter will cover in detail the development process for  creating a simple NumberField plug-in, allowing you to focus on the process rather  than the widget.  A home for your plug-ins and dynamic  actions APEX allows you to create plug-ins for item, region, dynamic action, and process  types. Like templates and themes, plug-ins are designed to be shared, so they can   be easily exported and imported from one workspace application to another.   Plug-ins can also be subscribed, providing a way to easily share and update   common attributes between plug-ins. In Chapter 3 Building a Ext theme into APEX, I discussed the benefits of building  your theme in a dedicated TEMPLATE application, and building simple test pages  as you go to verify the templates. These test pages also form part of your template  documentation, allowing team members to examine and understand specific  functionality in isolation. The same principle applies for building plug-ins and  dynamic actions.  Building a better Number Field APEX 4.0 introduced the Number Field as a new item type, allowing you to  configure number-range checks by optionally specifying minimum and maximum  value attributes. It also automatically checks that the entered value is a number, and  performs NOT NULL validation as well. You can also specify a format mask for the  number as well, presumably to enforce decimal places.  This all sounds great, and it does work as described, but only after you have  submitted the page for processing on the server.  The following screenshot shows the APEX and Ext versions of the Number Field,  both setup with a valid number range of 1 to 10,000. The APEX version allows you  to enter any characters you want, including letters. The Ext version automatically  filters the keys pressed to only accept numbers, conditionally the decimal separator,  and the negative sign. It also highlights invalid values when you go outside the valid  number range.  [ 202 ]   Chapter 7  We are going to build a better Number Field using APEX plug-ins to provide   better functionality on the client side, and still maintain the same level of   server-side validation.  The Number Field is quite a simple example, allowing us to be introduced to how  APEX plug-ins work without getting bogged down in the details.  The process of building a plug-in requires the following:   	 Creating a plug-in in your application workspace  	 Creating a test page containing your plug-in and necessary extras to test it  	 Running your application to test functionality  	 Repeating the build test cycle, progressively adding more features until   satisfied with the result.  Creating a plug-in item For our Number Field, we will be creating an item plug-in. So, navigate to the plug-ins page in Application Builder, found under Application  Builder  Application xxx  Shared Components  Plug-ins, and press Create to  open the Plug-in Create Edit page.  Start filling in the following fields:   	   	 Name: Ext.form.NumberField. Here, I'm using the Ext naming for the   widget, but that's just for a convenience. Internal Name: Oracle's recommendation here is to use your organization's  domain name as a prefix. So for example, a company domain of mycompany. com would prefix a plug-in named Slider, would result in an internal name  of COM.MYCOMPANY.SLIDER.  [ 203 ]   Working with Plug-ins and Dynamic Actions   	 File Prefix: As we are referencing the Ext JavaScript libraries in our page  template, we can skip this field completely. For specialized plug-ins that   are only used on a handful of specific pages, you would attach a   JavaScript file here.   	 Source: For the PL SQL source code required to implement our plug-in,   you can either enter it as a PL SQL anonymous block of code that contains  functions for rendering, validating and AJAX callbacks, or refer to code in a  PL SQL package in the database.  You get better performance using PL SQL packages in the database, so that's the  smart way to go. Simply include your package function names in the Callbacks  section, as shown in the following screenshot, noting that no AJAX function name is  specified as no AJAX functionality is required for this plug-in. The package doesn't  need to exist at this time—the form will submit successfully anyway.  Standard attributes: In addition to being able to create up to ten custom attributes, the APEX team  has made the standard attributes available for plug-ins to use. This is really  useful, because the standard attributes comprise elements that are useful for most  components, such as width and height. They also have items such as List of Values   LOV , which have more complicated validation rules already built-in, checking SQL  queries used for the LOV source are valid queries, and so on.  For the Number Field, only a few attributes have been checked:   	 Is Visible Widget: Indicating the element will be displayed  [ 204 ]   Chapter 7   	 Session State Changeable: So that APEX knows to store the value of the    	 Has Read Only Attribute: So that conditional logic can be used to make the   item in session state  item read only   	 Has Width Attributes: Allowing the width of the item to be set  Notice that some of the attributes are disabled in the following screenshot. This is  because the APEX Builder conditionally enables the checkboxes that are dependent  on another attribute. So, in this screenshot the List of Values Required, Has LOV  Display Null Attributes, and Has Cascading LOV Attributes checkboxes are  disabled, because they are dependant on the Has List of Values checkbox. Once it is  checked, the other checkboxes are enabled.  Custom attributes:  Defining the custom attributes for our Number Field is largely an exercise in  reviewing the configuration options available in the documentation for Ext.form. NumberField, and deciding which options are most useful to be included.  You need to also take into account that some configuration options are already  included when you define an APEX item using your plug-in. For example, Item  Label is included with an APEX item, but is rendered separately from the item, so  don't need to be included. Likewise Value Required is a validation rule, and is also  separate when rendering the APEX item.  [ 205 ]   Working with Plug-ins and Dynamic Actions  The following next screenshot shows some Ext.form.NumberField configuration  options, overlaid with the custom attributes defined in APEX for the plug-in:  I've chosen not to include the allowBlank config option as a custom attribute, simply  because this can be determined by the APEX Value Required property. Other  Configuration options, such as allowDecimals and allowNegative, are included as  custom attributes as Yes No types.  The custom attributes created are listed in the following table:  Label Allow Decimals Allow Negative Decimal Precision Minimum Value Maximum Value Number Alignment  Type Yes No Yes No Number Number Number Select List  Depending on  Values  Allow Decimals  left, center, right  Required Yes Yes No No No No  [ 206 ]   Chapter 7  Custom events: Custom events are used to define JavaScript event that can be exposed to dynamic  actions. For this simple plug-in, there is no need to define any custom events.  At this point, we are done defining the Number Field in APEX; it's time to turn our  attention to building the database package to execute the Callbacks to render and  validate the plug-in.  Defining the plug-in Callback functions Plug-ins must implement a fixed interface, defined for the plug-in type  item, region,  dynamic action  and the Callback function  Render, AJAX, Validation .  For example, the item type plug-in Render Functions must implement the   following interface:  function         p_item                in apex_plugin.t_page_item,     p_plugin              in apex_plugin.t_plugin,     p_value               in varchar2,     p_is_readonly         in boolean,     p_is_printer_friendly in boolean       return apex_plugin.t_page_item_render_result  So, for the Number Field plug-in, I'm using a package name plug_ext_form_ numberfield, and function names render, ajax, and validate.  The PL SQL package specification becomes:  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE plug_ext_form_numberfield AS  function render       p_item                in apex_plugin.t_page_item,     p_plugin              in apex_plugin.t_plugin,     p_value               in varchar2,     p_is_readonly         in boolean,     p_is_printer_friendly in boolean       return apex_plugin.t_page_item_render_result;  function ajax       p_item   in apex_plugin.t_page_item,     p_plugin in apex_plugin.t_plugin       return apex_plugin.t_page_item_ajax_result;  function validate    [ 207 ]               Working with Plug-ins and Dynamic Actions      p_item   in     apex_plugin.t_page_item,     p_plugin in     apex_plugin.t_plugin,     p_value  in     varchar2       return apex_plugin.t_page_item_validation_result;  END;    For the PL SQL package body, we'll start out by building working stubs for the  functions, and fill in the details, as we work through the solution.

The "stub" is a basic template pattern for item plug-ins;  you simply insert the relevant code for your particular plug-in where the @todo  comments are shown.  I'm not going to spend much time going through this PL SQL code; that would be  like "teaching your Grandmother how to suck eggs", as the saying goes.  There are a few important points worth noting though.  The APEX plug-in engine does a lot of work for you before it calls the plug-in code  to render, validate, or execute AJAX processing on an item. The engine gathers the  relevant metadata for the specific APEX page item, performing substitutions along the  way before passing that information through to the plug-in as record-type parameters.  So, looking at the render function specification,  FUNCTION render     p_item                in apex_plugin.t_page_item,   p_plugin              in apex_plugin.t_plugin,   p_value               in varchar2,   p_is_readonly         in boolean,   p_is_printer_friendly in boolean     return apex_plugin.t_page_item_render_result  you can see the the function is being passed record types apex_plugin.t_page_ item and apex_plugin.t_plugin, and returning t_page_item_render_result.   The definitions for the record types are contained in the APEX_PLUGIN   APEX_040000.WWV_FLOW_PLUGIN  package specification, and include the  following type declarations:  type t_plugin is record       name         varchar2 45 ,     file_prefix  varchar2 4000 ,     attribute_01 varchar2 32767 ,     ...     attribute_10 varchar2 32767   ;  [ 211 ]   Working with Plug-ins and Dynamic Actions  type t_page_item is record       id                          number,     name                        varchar2 255 ,     label                       varchar2 4000 ,     plain_label                 varchar2 4000 ,     format_mask                 varchar2 255 ,     is_required                 boolean,     lov_definition              varchar2 4000 ,     lov_display_extra           boolean,     lov_display_null            boolean,     lov_null_text               varchar2 255 ,     lov_null_value              varchar2 255 ,     lov_cascade_parent_items    varchar2 255 ,     ajax_items_to_submit        varchar2 255 ,     ajax_optimize_refresh       boolean,     element_width               number,     element_max_length          number,     element_height              number,     element_attributes          varchar2 2000 ,     element_option_attributes   varchar2 4000 ,     escape_output               boolean,     attribute_01                varchar2 32767 ,     ...     attribute_10                varchar2 32767   ;  type t_page_item_render_result is record       is_navigable     boolean default false,     navigable_dom_id varchar2 255   ;  As you can see, there is a fairly substantial amount of metadata available for you to  use when generating code for your plug-in.  Once you start writing, your plug-in the package APEX_PLUGIN_UTIL  APEX_040000. WWV_FLOW_PLUGIN_UTIL  contains some very useful procedures to help you  build plug-ins quickly. A number of them have already been included in our   stub plug-in.  [ 212 ]   One of the utility procedures most useful when starting out building your plug-in is  the debugging procedure, called using the following code:  Chapter 7    if apex_application.g_debug then     apex_plugin_util.debug_page_item          p_plugin    => p_plugin,        p_page_item => p_item  ;   end if;  With debugging enabled for a page containing your plug-in, the debugging page  shows the parameters values being passed to your plug-in package, as can be seen in  the following screenshot:  At this point, it's a good time to create a page and include the number plug-in, so we  can do some testing and progressively add functionality to the plug-in.  [ 213 ]   Working with Plug-ins and Dynamic Actions  Creating a page item based on the Number  Field plug-in Creating a page item based on your plug-in is done exactly the same way you would  any standard APEX item. Simply create the item, then select your plug-in under the  Display option, and start filling in the details for the item as usual. The standard attributes available are determined by the plug-in definition; we didn't  select the standard attribute Has List of Values for the plug-in earlier, so that section  isn't available for our Number Field. The custom attributes we defined for the Number  Field appear in the Settings section, as you can see in the following screenshot:  So, go ahead and create a test page with your shiny new Number Field plug-in,  and give it a test run. If everything is working as expected, then it should look and  behave exactly like a standard APEX Text Field. It will accept any text you enter,  submit and store the result in Session state, and render it as a read-only field if you  set the Read-Only Condition.  [ 214 ]   Chapter 7  The only inconvenient thing about it is that annoying JavaScript alert shown in  preceding screenshot, reminding us that we haven't finished writing the plug-in  source. Let's remedy that now.  Render functionality for the Number Field  plug-in Our stub function already includes enough logic to behave as a standard APEX Text  field. To make it behave as an Ext.form.NumberField, providing automatic keystroke  filtering and number validation, we need to generate JavaScript code to convert it.  The generated JavaScript will look similar to the following:  Ext.onReady function  {     new Ext.form.NumberField {         applyTo:          'P120_NUMBER_FIELD',         allowDecimals:    false         allowNegative:    false,         decimalPrecision: 2,         minValue:         1,         maxValue:         10000,         value:            54     } ; } ;  You can easily test this on your test page by pasting the preceding code into the  Firebug console in Firefox, changing the applyTo value to match your page item, and  running it.  Looking at the generated JavaScript, it's readily apparent that the code generator  simply needs to build up the text, adding the parameters and dynamic values   as it goes.  The final version of the render function is as follows:  FUNCTION render     p_item                in apex_plugin.t_page_item,   p_plugin              in apex_plugin.t_plugin,   p_value               in varchar2,   p_is_readonly         in boolean,   p_is_printer_friendly in boolean     return apex_plugin.t_page_item_render_result IS   l_result apex_plugin.t_page_item_render_result;  [ 215 ]   Working with Plug-ins and Dynamic Actions    subtype attr is     apex_application_page_items.attribute_01%type;    -- assign local names to attributes   l_allow_decimals    attr := p_item.attribute_01;   l_allow_negative    attr := p_item.attribute_02;   l_decimal_precision attr := p_item.attribute_03;   l_min_value         attr := p_item.attribute_04;   l_max_value         attr := p_item.attribute_05;   l_align             attr := p_item.attribute_06;    -- Only use escaped value for the HTML output!   l_code          varchar2 32767 ;   l_escaped_value varchar2 32767                      := sys.htf.escape_sc p_value ;   l_name          varchar2 30 ;  To improve the readability of your code, it's worthwhile assigning the p_item  attribute values to local variables.  Also highly recommended is escaping any values passed from the HTML page  using the Oracle provided sys.htf.escape_sc function to prevent SQL injection  attacks. A malicious person can easily circumvent any HTML page protection using  developer tools, such as Firebug, to force the page to submit SQL injection text.

Once again, APEX has provided utilities  in the APEX_JAVASCRIPT  APEX_040000.WWV_FLOW_JAVASCRIPT  package to  simplify the process.  [ 218 ]   Chapter 7  Validation functionality for the Number Field  plug-in Currently, the validation function for the Number Field plug-in does absolutely  nothing; it's just a stub that compiles and nothing more. Even so, APEX does some  validation for us, checking for mandatory items.  The final code for the validation function verifies the page item value is a number  with a value conforming to the rules specified for the page item:  FUNCTION validate     p_item   in     apex_plugin.t_page_item,   p_plugin in     apex_plugin.t_plugin,   p_value  in     varchar2     return apex_plugin.t_page_item_validation_result IS   subtype attr is     apex_application_page_items.attribute_01%type;    -- assign local names to attributes   l_allow_decimals attr   := p_item.attribute_01;   l_allow_negative attr   := p_item.attribute_02;   l_precision      number := to_number p_item.attribute_03 ;   l_min_value      number := to_number p_item.attribute_04 ;   l_max_value      number := to_number p_item.attribute_05 ;    n number;   l_result apex_plugin.t_page_item_validation_result; BEGIN   -- Debug information   if apex_application.g_debug then     apex_plugin_util.debug_page_item          p_plugin    => p_plugin,        p_page_item => p_item  ;   end if;    -- Nothing to do when null  APEX checks for mandatory items    if p_value is null then return l_result; end if;    -- verify value is numeric   begin     n := to_number p_value ;   exception   when value_error then  [ 219 ]   Working with Plug-ins and Dynamic Actions       l_result.message := 'Value for '        p_item.plain_label' must be a number';      return l_result;   end;    case when l_allow_decimals = 'N' and n   trunc n  then        l_result.message := 'Decimals not allowed for '          p_item.plain_label;   when l_precision is not null         and n   trunc n,l_decimal_precision  then        l_result.message := 'Decimals places cannot exceed '          l_precision' for 'p_item.plain_label;   when l_allow_negative = 'N' and n   abs n  then        l_result.message := 'Negative numbers not allowed'          ' for 'p_item.plain_label;   when l_min_value is not null and n < l_min_value then        l_result.message := 'The minimum value for '          p_item.plain_label' is 'l_min_value;   when l_max_value is not null and n > l_max_value then        l_result.message := 'The maximum value for '          p_item.plain_label' is 'l_max_value;   else null;   end case;    -- return l_result with error message, success => null   return l_result; END validate;  That wraps up the implementation for the Number Field Plug-in; the final package  specification and package body are found in the files included with the book   under Chapter 7.  [ 220 ]   Chapter 7  Summary In this chapter, we have covered the development process for creating an item type  plug-in, showing how to define the plug-in and its parameters in APEX.  We initially created a "stub" PL SQL package for the Plug-in, allowing us to create   a test page for our Plug-in and start using it as a standard APEX text item. Once   the stub was working, we then were able to add in the enhanced JavaScript  functionality progressively on the web page, before completing the Plug-in by  adding the server-side validation.  Since the NumberField is just enhancing a standard HTML input field and does  not add additional HTML elements, the standard Dynamic Actions will work quite  happily without change. We haven't implemented any AJAX functionality because  there hasn't been any requirement.  Chapter 8 implements a much more sophisticated component, the Ext.form. ComboBox, as a Plug-in, and deals with both AJAX functionality and Dynamic  Actions, so we will have a look at that next.  [ 221 ]    Data Stores, AJAX-enabled  Plug-ins, and Dynamic  Actions  Data Stores provide the Ext JS framework with the ability to store data on the  browser client acting much like an in-memory database. This provides enormous  flexibility for data-aware components, such as the ComboBox, GridPanel, and  TreePanel, as it logically separates the component from the data.  This makes the process of integrating AJAX functionality into plug-ins far simpler,  because the AJAX processes will be focused on just passing data between the  browser client and the database. The Ext components already contain the client-side  functionality to update the display.  On the database side, APEX provides rich PL SQL APIs to speed up the  development of plug-ins. We will be making good use of the APEX-provided PL  SQL APIs to simplify component development.  In this chapter we will cover:   	 Storing data on the browser client using Ext.data.Store  	 Creating a complex ComboBox Plug-in, dealing with more advanced plugin   concepts including AJAX processing and interacting with dynamic actions  	 Overriding standard Ext.form.ComboBox functionality to work within the   APEX Dynamic Actions framework   	 Creating APEX Custom Events for the ComboBox plugin   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  It makes for an interesting chapter, by really bringing the client-side Ext JS  framework together with the server-side capabilities of APEX to harness   their full potential.  Storing data on the browser client The Ext.data.Store class is used to store data on the browser client acting much  like an in-memory database. The Store class caches Record objects that are used by  data-aware components such as the ComboBox, GridPanel, and TreePanel.  Data is loaded into a Store using different formats such as JavaScript Arrays, XML, or  JSON through the Ext.data.DataReader class. The DataReader class has subclasses  ArrayReader, JsonReader, and XmlReader that read structured data from a data  source in a specific format, converting it into Record objects and metadata for use by  a Store object.  A number of Store types are available such as ArrayStore, JsonStore, and XmlStore,  customized and pre-configured for use with a specific DataReader. These custom  store types act as a helper class to provide a simpler shorthand way of implementing  the same solution.  For example, a basic Data Store to consume an Array looks like:     data array of records var countryData = [      ["Afghanistan","65"]     ,["Aland Islands","131"]     ,["Albania, Republic of","118"]          *..snipped..*      ,["Zambia, Republic of","64"]     ,["Zimbabwe","54"]     ];     define the record type structure var countryRecord = Ext.data.Record.create [  { name: 'countryName', mapping : 1 }, { name: 'countryId',   mapping : 2 } ] ;     create a reader, assigning the record type var arrayReader = new Ext.data.ArrayReader {}, countryRecord ;     create a store, assigning the reader var store = new Ext.data.Store {  [ 224 ]               Chapter 8  It can be re-written using the Ext.data.ArrayStore, when it simply becomes:      reader : arrayReader } ;     manually load the store store.loadData countryData ;     data array of records var countryData = [      ["Afghanistan","65"]     ,["Aland Islands","131"]     ,["Albania, Republic of","118"]          *..snipped..*      ,["Zambia, Republic of","64"]     ,["Zimbabwe","54"]     ];     create the store, assigning fields var store = new Ext.data.ArrayStore {     fields: ["countryName", "countryId"],     data: countryData } ;  We will be using Ext.data.ArrayStore when data is locally defined in the page.  The ArrayStore is configured with an Ext.data.ArrayReader that automatically  calls the store's load method after creation to load the data into the store.  The following function should be included as part of a database package to render  the ArrayStore:  FUNCTION render_local_store     p_item    in apex_plugin.t_page_item,   p_plugin  in apex_plugin.t_plugin,   p_value   in varchar2     RETURN sys.dbms_sql.desc_tab2 IS    l_sql_handler    apex_plugin_util.t_sql_handler;   l_col_value_list apex_plugin_util.t_column_value_list;   l_col_count      number;  BEGIN   -- open sql cursor and get description for sql statement   l_sql_handler := apex_plugin_util.get_sql_handler       p_sql_statement  => p_item.lov_definition,  [ 225 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions      p_min_columns    => 1,     p_max_columns    => 999,     p_component_name => p_item.id    ;    l_col_count := l_sql_handler.column_list.count  ;    -- binds all page item bind variables   apex_plugin_util.prepare_query       p_sql_handler      => l_sql_handler  ;    -- fetch the data   l_col_value_list := apex_plugin_util.get_data       p_sql_handler => l_sql_handler  ;    -- close the open cursor created by get_sql_handler   apex_plugin_util.free_sql_handler l_sql_handler ;    -- start script   sys.htp.p ' ' ;   sys.htp.p 'Ext.onReady function  {' ;   sys.htp.p 'var ns = Ext.ns "Ext.apex.'p_item.name'" ;' ;    -- print data   if l_col_value_list.exists 1  then     sys.htp.p 'ns.data = [' ;     for i in 1 .. l_col_value_list 1 .count loop       sys.htp.prn case when i > 1 then ',' else ' ' end'[' ;       for j in 1 .. l_col_count loop         sys.htp.prn case when j > 1 then ',' end           '"'apex_plugin_util.escape                   l_col_value_list j  i ,true '"' ;       end loop;       sys.htp.p ']' ;     end loop;     sys.htp.p '];' ;   else     sys.htp.p 'ns.data = [];' ;   end if;    -- print store   sys.htp.p '   simple array store' ;   sys.htp.p 'ns.store = new Ext.data.ArrayStore {' ;   sys.htp.prn '    fields: [' ;  [ 226 ]   Chapter 8    for i in 1 .. l_col_count loop     sys.htp.prn case when i > 1 then ',' end              '"'l_sql_handler.column_list i .col_name'"' ;   end loop;   sys.htp.p '],' ;   sys.htp.p '    data : ns.data' ;   sys.htp.p '} ;' ;    -- end script   sys.htp.p '} ;' ;   sys.htp.p ' ' ;    return l_sql_handler.column_list; EXCEPTION   when others then     apex_plugin_util.free_sql_handler l_sql_handler ;     raise; END render_local_store;  The render_local_store uses the APEX_PLUGIN_UTIL  WWV_FLOW_PLUGIN_UTIL   package to prepare the SQL query, bind session state variables, and retrieve the data.  That's quite a bit of work done for you by APEX, leaving you to render the data in  the desired format, in this case as a data store.  The JavaScript produced by the render_local_store function looks like   the following:    Ext.onReady function  {    var ns = Ext.ns "Ext.apex.P120_COMBO" ;    ns.data = [    ["Afghanistan","65"]   ,["Aland Islands","131"]   ,["Albania, Republic of","118"]        * ..snipped .. *    ,["Zambia, Republic of","64"]   ,["Zimbabwe","54"]   ];       simple array store   ns.store = new Ext.data.ArrayStore {       fields: ["CODE_DESCRIPTION","ID"],       data : ns.data  [ 227 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions    } ; } ;    The only difference from our earlier example of an ArrayStore is that the store has   been namespaced:    var ns = Ext.ns "Ext.apex.P120_COMBO" ; ...   ns.store = new Ext.data.ArrayStore {       fields: ["CODE_DESCRIPTION","ID"],       data : ns.data   } ;  The Ext.apex.P120_COMBO namespace has been defined using the Ext.ns   namespace  function. By assigning local variable ns to the namespace, an "alias" has  been defined, allowing you to code using the generic, abbreviated version. The store  is an object within this namespace, and can be referenced from JavaScript elsewhere  in a page using the fully qualified name Ext.apex.P120_COMBO.store.  Using Data Stores with large datasets It's not practical for large datasets to be stored locally in the page, so when returning  large datasets, the sensible approach is to fetch only a subset of data using an AJAX  request, letting the user remotely load the data and use pagination and filtering  functionality to filter the results.  For large datasets, we will use Ext.data.JsonStore, which is automatically  configured with Ext.data.JsonReader, and implicitly creates Ext.data.HttpProxy  if a URL is specified. The HttpProxy uses the browser's XHR  XML Http Request   object to perform generic AJAX requests.  For APEX plug-ins, a JsonStore would look like:  var store = new Ext.data.JsonStore {     url: 'wwv_flow.show',     root: 'rowset',     idProperty: 1,     fields: ["countryName", "countryId"],     baseParams: {         p_flow_id: Ext.getDom 'pFlowId' .value,         p_flow_step_id: Ext.getDom 'pFlowStepId' .value,         p_instance: Ext.getDom 'pInstance' .value,         p_request: 'PLUGIN=4A6E248DAACFAED09B96..7261F1E1F7E'     },  [ 228 ]   Chapter 8      paramNames: {         start:'p_widget_action_mod',         limit:'p_widget_action'     } } ;  The JsonStore calls the named url, passing parameter names and values sourced  from the baseParams and paramNames config options.  The following PL SQL function render_remote_store generates the JavaScript for  a remote store definition, and should be included in a database package:  FUNCTION render_remote_store     p_item    in apex_plugin.t_page_item,   p_plugin  in apex_plugin.t_plugin,   p_value   in varchar2     RETURN sys.dbms_sql.desc_tab2 IS    l_sql_handler    apex_plugin_util.t_sql_handler;   l_col_value_list apex_plugin_util.t_column_value_list;   l_col_count      number;   l_col_names      varchar2 32767 ;    l_script  varchar2 32767  := q'^   Ext.onReady function  {     var ns = Ext.ns 'Ext.apex.ITEM_NAME' ;         simple array store     ns.store = new Ext.data.JsonStore {         url: 'wwv_flow.show',         root: 'rowset',         fields: [FIELD_LIST],         baseParams: {             p_flow_id: Ext.getDom 'pFlowId' .value,             p_flow_step_id: Ext.getDom 'pFlowStepId' .value,             p_instance: Ext.getDom 'pInstance' .value,             p_request: 'PLUGIN=AJAX_IDENTIFIER'         },         paramNames: {             start:'p_widget_action_mod',             limit:'p_widget_action'         }     } ;   } ;   ^';  [ 229 ]    Chapter 8      'FIELD_LIST',l_col_names ;    wwv_flow_utilities.fast_replace l_script,     'AJAX_IDENTIFIER',apex_plugin.get_ajax_identifier ;    -- add JS to bottom of page   apex_javascript.add_onload_code       p_code => l_script  ;    return l_sql_handler.column_list; EXCEPTION   when others then     apex_plugin_util.free_sql_handler l_sql_handler ;     raise; END render_remote_store;  Again, the APEX_PLUGIN_UTIL package is used to parse the query and retrieve the  column names. This time we don't need to return any data because this will be done  by the Ext data-aware component when it initiates a XHR request. Instead, we are  just defining the structure of the records held in the data store, and defining the  parameters for the HttpRequest object.  The code to retrieve the data will be dependent on each custom plug-in and handled  by the PL SQL code for AJAX requests, so we won't provide the details here. For a  simple tabular component such as a ComboBox or Grid, data returned would   look like:  {"total":20,"rowset":[  {"CODE_DESCRIPTION": "Bahamas, Commonwealth of the","ID": "170"} ,{"CODE_DESCRIPTION": "Bahrain, Kingdom of","ID": "67"} ,{"CODE_DESCRIPTION": "Bangladesh, People's Republic of","ID": "68"} ,{"CODE_DESCRIPTION": "Barbados","ID": "171"} ,{"CODE_DESCRIPTION": "Belarus","ID": "124"} ,{"CODE_DESCRIPTION": "Belgium, Kingdom of","ID": "121"} ,{"CODE_DESCRIPTION": "Belize","ID": "173"} ,{"CODE_DESCRIPTION": "Benin, People's Republic of","ID": "20"} ,{"CODE_DESCRIPTION": "Bermuda","ID": "172"} ,{"CODE_DESCRIPTION": " Belize","ID": "173"} ]}  Here, the total number of records is shown for the filtered result set for the   query. This example shows countries starting with "B". There are a total of 20  matching records; the records shown are the first results returned for a pageSize   limit of 10 records.  [ 231 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  Data Stores are a critical component for data-aware components, but are quite  straightforward to understand once you start using them. Let's move onto the  ComboBox plug-in to see them in action.  Building a ComboBox plug-in We introduced Ext.form.ComboBox in Chapter 6, Adding Ext Layout Elements,  showing how it can be used as a direct replacement for the HTML Select List. It  provides the same drop-down list of values, as well as auto-completing filtering  functionality, enabling users to find and select a value quickly.  But that's only scratching the surface of what the ComboBox can do!  In this section, we will cover creating a plug-in ComboBox, enabling functionality for  it to do both local and remote loading of data. The ComboBox can use all of the Ext  data store classes for its input data, so we will cover using the ArrayStore for local  ComboBoxes, and the JsonStore for remote ComboBoxes.  Unlike the new APEX 4.0 Auto-complete item type and the HTML Select List,  ComboBoxes are not limited to just one or two columns for data. We will also cover  how to use the Ext.XTemplate to provide enhanced formatting options to show  more information to your application users. The example in the following screenshot  shows a person's name, address fields, and a credit limit using CSS-formatted text  and images—all displayed using conditional logic.  [ 232 ]   Chapter 8  The ComboBox can also be used as a direct replacement for the native APEX Popup  List of Values. Those clunky popups in a separate browser window will be a thing of  the past!  Finally, we will cover how Dynamic Actions interact with widgets made up of  multiple DOM elements like the ComboBox.  Defining the ComboBox plug-in We will be picking up the pace in our ComboBox definition, as defining plug-ins is  about following a pattern. The new functionality will be covered in greater detail;  the full source for the database package is included in the Chapter 8 source code files  available on Packt's site .  Plugin name:  Ext.form.ComboBox  Callbacks:  Standard attributes:   	 Render function name:    	 AJAX function name:      	 Validation function name:    plug_ext_form_combo.render  plug_ext_form_combo.ajax  plug_ext_form_combo.validate  [ 233 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  Having the List of Values enabled is the key to defining the query for our ComboBox.  We will be adding an extra column as part of the solution, limiting the number of  allowable columns to just 998 columns!  As a design choice, I've decided a minimum of two columns are required, these  columns are the description and value fields.  Custom attributes:  Label Mode Empty text Template config Page size Min. characters  Type Select List Text Textarea Number Integer  Required Yes No No No No  Mode Mode  Depending on Values  remote, local  Events:  Name onSelect  Internal name select  Defining the ComboBox plug-in callback  functions The PL SQL package specification for the ComboBox is identical to the NumberField  package specification, apart from the changing of the name:  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE plug_ext_form_combo AS function render       p_item                in apex_plugin.t_page_item,     p_plugin              in apex_plugin.t_plugin,     p_value               in varchar2,     p_is_readonly         in boolean,     p_is_printer_friendly in boolean       return apex_plugin.t_page_item_render_result;  function ajax       p_item   in apex_plugin.t_page_item,     p_plugin in apex_plugin.t_plugin       return apex_plugin.t_page_item_ajax_result;  [ 234 ]   Chapter 8  function validate       p_item   in  apex_plugin.t_page_item,     p_plugin in  apex_plugin.t_plugin,     p_value  in  varchar2       return apex_plugin.t_page_item_validation_result;  END;    OR  Once again we will look at the details of each function separately; the full package  body and specification are included in the Chapter 8 source files available for  download on Packt's site.  Rendering functionality for the ComboBox  plug-in The PL SQL render function uses the metadata passed to it to generate HTML and  JavaScript to fulfill the following requirements:   	 For a display-only item, create a stateful HTML element as a SPAN element    	 Create an HTML element that will be transformed into a ComboBox  	 Generate JavaScript defining a data store either locally with the data   in a JavaScript array, or as a remote data store with parameters for an   XHR request   	 Generate JavaScript code defining the ComboBox and referencing the store  The PL SQL code for the render function is as follows:  FUNCTION render       p_item                in apex_plugin.t_page_item,     p_plugin              in apex_plugin.t_plugin,     p_value               in varchar2,     p_is_readonly         in boolean,     p_is_printer_friendly in boolean       return apex_plugin.t_page_item_render_result IS   l_result apex_plugin.t_page_item_render_result;    subtype attr is     apex_application_page_items.attribute_01%type;  [ 235 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions    -- assign local names to attributes   l_mode       attr := p_item.attribute_01;   l_emptyText  attr := p_item.attribute_02;   l_tpl        attr := p_item.attribute_03;   l_pageSize   number := to_number p_item.attribute_04 ;   l_minChars   number := to_number p_item.attribute_05 ;    -- Only use escaped value for the HTML output!   l_code          varchar2 32767 ;   l_escaped_value varchar2 32767                      := sys.htf.escape_sc p_value ;   l_name          varchar2 30 ;   l_columns       sys.dbms_sql.desc_tab2; BEGIN   -- Debug information   if apex_application.g_debug then     apex_plugin_util.debug_page_item         p_plugin              => p_plugin,       p_page_item           => p_item,       p_value               => p_value,       p_is_readonly         => p_is_readonly,       p_is_printer_friendly => p_is_printer_friendly  ;   end if;    if p_is_readonly or p_is_printer_friendly then     -- emit hidden field if necessary     apex_plugin_util.print_hidden_if_readonly         p_item_name           => p_item.name,       p_value               => p_value,       p_is_readonly         => p_is_readonly,       p_is_printer_friendly => p_is_printer_friendly  ;      -- emit display span with the value     apex_plugin_util.print_display_only         p_item_name        => p_item.name,       p_display_value    => p_value,       p_show_line_breaks => false,       p_escape           => true,       p_attributes       => p_item.element_attributes  ;    else     -- If a page item saves state, we have to call the     -- get_input_name_for_page_item to render the internal     -- hidden p_arg_names field.

Some areas are new, which do  need some discussion.  [ 239 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  Some convenience routines not used in the NumberField example have been  added, those being push, escape_json, and get_properties. The push procedure  temporarily stores name and value attributes in an associative array  index by  table  for later retrieval by the get_properties function. Using an associative  array indexed by the attribute name means the attributes can be sent as output  in alphabetical order when it suits later in the code. Having the attributes in  alphabetical order isn't necessary, but it does help when debugging JavaScript.   Using custom routines instead of the APEX supplied wwv_flow_javascript.add_ attribute routine gives a little more control for JSON escaping text, which is done  by the escape_json function.  The second area of interest is the render_local_store and render_remote_store  functions that build store definitions. The code to render both the local and remote  stores was covered earlier in the chapter, so all we are doing here is calling the   PL SQL routines to generate the code.  To show the JavaScript generated, I've created a simple ComboBox item using a local  store. The settings and LOV query are shown in the following screenshot:  [ 240 ]   Chapter 8  The JavaScript output for only the ComboBox is:  apex.jQuery document .ready function  {  function  { Ext.onReady function  {     new Ext.form.ComboBox {         applyTo: 'P120_COMBO',         disabled: Ext.fly 'P120_COMBO' .dom.disabled,         emptyText: 'Select a Country...',         forceSelection: true,         hiddenName: 'p_t05',         hiddenValue: '221',         id: 'ext-P120_COMBO',         mode: 'local',         resizable: true,         selectOnFocus: true,         triggerAction: 'all',         value: 'Australia, Commonwealth of',         displayField: 'CODE_DESCRIPTION',         store: Ext.apex.P120_COMBO.store,         valueField: 'ID'     } ; } ; }   ; } ;  The JavaScript code generated by the ComboBox plug-in has been wrapped by  an anonymous function, and a apex.jQuery document .ready function. APEX  automatically added these extra functions when we called the apex_javascript.add_ onload_code procedure to ensure that JavaScript is not executed until the browser has  the DOM tree loaded  without waiting for external resources . To ensure that the Ext  library has been loaded, I would also like to include the Ext.onReady call.  References to the Store have been highlighted; the Store is identified by its fully  qualified name Ext.apex.P120_COMBO.store, with the ComboBox's display and  value fields assigned to use the Store records CODE_DESCRIPTION and ID columns.  In this example, the value and hiddenValue attributes have been assigned by   the render function, performing a lookup on the APEX session state value for   the P120_COMBO item.  The final area of interest is around the use of Ext.XTemplate to provide enhanced  formatting options, which we will cover together with retrieving data for ComboBox  using XHR requests under the AJAX section.  [ 241 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  AJAX functionality for the ComboBox plug-in For large datasets, the ComboBox can be configured to fetch a subset of data using an  AJAX request to load the data remotely, and use pagination and type-ahead search  functionality to filter the results.  FUNCTION ajax     p_item   in apex_plugin.t_page_item,   p_plugin in apex_plugin.t_plugin     return apex_plugin.t_page_item_ajax_result IS   l_result apex_plugin.t_page_item_ajax_result; BEGIN   -- indicate we are returning application json data   apex_plugin_util.print_json_http_header;    emit_json_data        p_item   => p_item,      p_plugin => p_plugin,      p_value  => null    ;    -- not used by APEX yet   return l_result; END;              The AJAX function here just calls an APEX procedure to print a JSON mime-type  header, indicating the data being returned is in JSON format and shouldn't be  cached. The actual text returned in the HTML Response header is:  Content-Type: application json Cache-Control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache  The real work is done by the following the EMIT_JSON_DATA procedure:  PROCEDURE emit_json_data     p_item   in apex_plugin.t_page_item,   p_plugin in apex_plugin.t_plugin,   p_value  in varchar2   IS   l_sql_handler    apex_plugin_util.t_sql_handler;   l_new_sql        varchar2 32767 ;   l_col_value_list apex_plugin_util.t_column_value_list;     ** @todo assign from combo attributes *   [ 242 ]   Chapter 8    l_search_type   varchar2 20  := 'EXACT_IGNORE';   l_search_col    varchar2 32767 ;   l_col_count number;    -- assign values from ajax parameters   l_start     number     := coalesce apex_application.g_widget_action_mod, 0 ;    l_limit     number     := coalesce apex_application.g_widget_action, 100 ;    l_search_string varchar2 32767      := apex_application.g_x01; BEGIN  Ext Stores need to know the total number of records in the result set, so it's necessary  to enclose the original query within a select statement to return the total as an extra  column named ext$totalrows:    -- add ext$totalrows column to sql statement   l_new_sql := 'select q.* ,count *  over    ext$totalrows'                '  from  'p_item.lov_definition'  q';  The total number of records is used by the Ext.PagingToolbar object, a sub- component of the ComboBox, to provide automatic paging control.     l_sql_handler := apex_plugin_util.get_sql_handler       p_sql_statement  => l_new_sql,     p_min_columns    => 1,     p_max_columns    => 999,     p_component_name => p_item.name    ;    apex_plugin_util.free_sql_handler l_sql_handler ;    l_col_count := l_sql_handler.column_list.count   - 1;    -- can't use APEX search because need to display totals   -- where clause has to be included at this level   if l_search_string is not null then     l_search_string := apex_plugin_util.get_search_string        p_search_type   => l_search_type,       p_search_string => l_search_string      ;  [ 243 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions      l_search_col := l_sql_handler.column_list 1 .col_name;      l_new_sql := l_new_sqlCRLF       case l_search_type       when 'CONTAINS_CASE'   then             'where instr 'l_search_col', '''             l_search_string'''  > 0'        when 'CONTAINS_IGNORE' then            'where instr upper 'l_search_col' , '''            l_search_string'''  > 0'        when 'EXACT_CASE'      then            'where 'l_search_col' like '''            l_search_string'%'''        when 'EXACT_IGNORE'    then            'where upper 'l_search_col'  like '''            l_search_string'%'''        when 'LOOKUP'          then            'where 'l_search_col' = '''            l_search_string''''       end;   end if;  The where clause needs to be included here to return the correct value for total  matching records, because APEX wraps the passed query inside another query  to limit the rows returned and the position of the first row returned, for example,  returning rows 100 to 110 of the result set.    -- get data based on our new sql statement   l_col_value_list := apex_plugin_util.get_data       p_sql_statement   => l_new_sql,     p_min_columns     => 1,     p_max_columns     => 999,     p_component_name  => p_item.id,     p_first_row       => l_start,     p_max_rows        => l_limit    ;    -- print data   if l_col_value_list.exists 1  then     sys.htp.p '{"total":'       l_col_value_list l_col_count + 1  1 ',"rowset":['  [ 244 ]   Chapter 8       ;      for i in 1 .. l_col_value_list 1 .count loop       sys.htp.prn case when i > 1 then ',' else ' ' end'{' ;       for j in 1 .. l_col_count loop         sys.htp.prn case when j > 1 then ',' end           '"'l_sql_handler.column_list j .col_name'": '           '"'escape_json l_col_value_list j  i  '"'          ;       end loop;       sys.htp.p '}' ;     end loop;      sys.htp.p ']}' ;   else     sys.htp.prn '{"total":0,"rowset":[]}' ;   end if;  EXCEPTION   when no_data_found then     apex_plugin_util.free_sql_handler l_sql_handler ;     sys.htp.prn '{"total":0,"rowset":[]}' ;    when others then     apex_plugin_util.free_sql_handler l_sql_handler ;     raise; END emit_json_data;  Once again, the APEX-provided APIs do most of the work processing the final query,  binding any session state variables, and returning the data, which we render using  JSON notation.  Using the Ext.XTemplate to provide enhanced  formatting The Ext.XTemplate class provides a templating mechanism that can be used to  render arrays of records automatically. It provides advanced functionality such as  conditional processing with basic comparison operators, basic math functions, and  executing arbitrary inline code using template variables.  [ 245 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  To show how the Ext.XTemplate is used for ComboBoxes, I've created a remote  ComboBox using the settings shown in the following screenshot:  The SQL query used for the LOV on this ComboBox is:  select c.cust_first_name' 'c.cust_last_name customer_name       ,c.customer_id       ,c.cust_street_address1       ,c.cust_street_address2       ,c.cust_city       ,c.cust_state       ,c.cust_postal_code       ,c.credit_limit   from demo_customers c   order by lower c.cust_first_name' 'c.cust_last_name   We are not particularly interested in the query itself; it obeys the rules for our  ComboBox plug-in, with the first column returned to be displayField, and the  second column valueField. It also retrieves a number of other fields that can also be  displayed by using XTemplates.  The PL SQL PLUG_EXT_FORM_COMBO.RENDER function generates the following  JavaScript for our ComboBox on a webpage:  Ext.onReady function  {     new Ext.form.ComboBox {         applyTo: 'P120_AJAX_COMBO',         disabled: Ext.fly 'P120_AJAX_COMBO' .dom.disabled,  [ 246 ]   Chapter 8          displayField: 'CUSTOMER_NAME',         emptyText: 'Customer Name...',         forceSelection: true,         getParams: function q {             var p = {};             if  this.pageSize  {                 p['p_widget_action_mod'] = 0;                 p['p_widget_action'] = this.pageSize;             }return p;         },         hiddenName: 'p_t06',         hiddenValue: '',         id: 'ext-P120_AJAX_COMBO',         idProperty: 'CUSTOMER_ID',         itemSelector: 'div.search-item',         minChars: 2,         mode: 'remote',         pageSize: 20,         queryParam: 'x01',         resizable: true,         selectOnFocus: true,         store: Ext.apex.P120_AJAX_COMBO.store,         tpl: new Ext.XTemplate  '  ',     '  {CREDIT_LIMIT}<  span>{CUSTOMER_NAME} ',     '{CUST_STREET_ADDRESS1} ',     ' ',     '{CUST_STREET_ADDRESS2} ',     ' ',     '{CUST_CITY} {CUST_STATE}   {CUST_POSTAL_CODE}', '  ', {compiled: true} ,         triggerAction: 'all',         triggerClass: 'x-form-search-trigger',         valueField: 'CUSTOMER_ID'     } ; } ;  The JavaScript shows the ComboBox configuration, including references to the data  store and the XTemplate definition, which has been highlighted.  [ 247 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  Typing the characters "be" in the ComboBox initiates an AJAX request to load the  data store. Two matching records are returned by the PLUG_EXT_FORM_COMBO.AJAX  function to the browser.  {"total":2,"rowset":[  {"CUSTOMER_NAME": "Benjamin Freeman",    "CUSTOMER_ID": "25560",    "CUST_STREET_ADDRESS1": "2",    "CUST_STREET_ADDRESS2": "19 Princes St",    "CUST_CITY": "KALPOWAR",    "CUST_STATE": "QLD",    "CUST_POSTAL_CODE": "4630",    "CREDIT_LIMIT": ""} ,{"CUSTOMER_NAME": "Bernard Newman",    "CUSTOMER_ID": "25649",    "CUST_STREET_ADDRESS1": "4 Bartlett Gr",    "CUST_STREET_ADDRESS2": "",    "CUST_CITY": "FLINDERS LANE",    "CUST_STATE": "VIC",    "CUST_POSTAL_CODE": "8009",    "CREDIT_LIMIT": ""} ]}  At this point the data store fires the datachanged event, and the ComboBox refreshes  its view using the specified XTemplate to render the data.  When a XTemplate is not provided, the ComboBox uses the default template string.  '  {' + this.displayField +  '}  '  The XTemplate for this example is:  '  ',     '  {CREDIT_LIMIT}<  span>{CUSTOMER_NAME} ',     '{CUST_STREET_ADDRESS1} ',     ' ',     '{CUST_STREET_ADDRESS2} ',     ' ',     '{CUST_CITY} {CUST_STATE}   {CUST_POSTAL_CODE}', '  ', {compiled: true}  [ 248 ]   Chapter 8  The XTemplate tpl tag and the for operator are used to process the data object for  the ComboBox. The for="." operator loops through the entire data object starting at  the root node.   Each array record is processed, substituting the column values into the column name  placeholders, for example {CUSTOMER_NAME}.  Conditional logic can be applied using the tpl tag and the if operator to provide  conditional checks to determine whether or not to render parts of the template.  Consider the following rule:      ' ',     '{CUST_STREET_ADDRESS2} ',     ' ',  In this example, this rule is used to produce output text only when the   CUST_STREET_ADDRESS2 field has a value.  When the XTemplate is being used to process multiple records, the compiled: true  attribute should be set for optimized performance.  The HTML produced on the browser by the XTemplate for the highlighted record  shown in the previous screenshot is:      1000  Adam Fripp  10 Kentish Dr UPPER WOODSTOCK TAS   7150    [ 249 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  Additional CSS rules need to be provided, either in the APEX page or the application  CSS file to produce the actual HTML formatting. The following CSS rules were  applied for this example:  .search-item {     border-color:FFFFFF FFFFFF EEEEEE;     border-style:solid;     border-width:1px;     color:555555;     font:11px tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;     padding:3px 10px;     white-space:normal; } .search-item h3 {     color:222222;     display:block;     font-weight:bold; } .search-item h3 span {     clear:none;     display:block;     float:right;     font-weight:normal;     margin:0 0 5px 5px;     line-height: 18px; }  .cc-limit {     color:c0272b;     font:normal 11px tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;     background: transparent no-repeat 0 2px;     background-image:url  ux playpen resources images icon  creditcards.gif ;     padding-left:18px; }  So as you can see, XTemplates provide a powerful mechanism to render HTML on  the browser client.   For AJAX-based processes, this removes the need to return formatted HTML, or  the necessity to have complicated JavaScript coding to render HTML tags inserting  values from the JSON data, when returning JSON data only.  [ 250 ]   Validation functionality for the ComboBox  plug-in After the relatively lengthy code for the RENDER and AJAX functionality, the code  to validate the ComboBox is quite trivial:  Chapter 8  FUNCTION validate     p_item   in     apex_plugin.t_page_item,   p_plugin in     apex_plugin.t_plugin,   p_value  in     varchar2     return apex_plugin.t_page_item_validation_result IS   l_display_value varchar2 32767 ;   l_result apex_plugin.t_page_item_validation_result; BEGIN   -- Debug information   if apex_application.g_debug then     apex_plugin_util.debug_page_item          p_plugin    => p_plugin,        p_page_item => p_item  ;   end if;    -- Nothing to do when null  APEX checks for mandatory items    if p_value is null then return l_result; end if;    -- lookup the display value when the value is not null   if p_value is not null then      l_display_value :=        apex_plugin_util.get_display_data            p_sql_statement  => p_item.lov_definition,          p_min_columns    => 2,          p_max_columns    => 999,          p_component_name => p_item.name,          p_search_string  => p_value,          p_display_extra  => false ;       -- return error when no display value found      if l_display_value is null then        l_result.message :=          'Error: no display value found for '          p_item.name' value 'p_value'.';      end if;   end if;    -- populate l_result with error message, otherwise null   return l_result; END;  The validate function uses the APEX-provided utilities to verify that matching display  value exists for the supplied value using the LOV query. If not, it raises an error.  [ 251 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  Mixing ComboBoxes with Dynamic  Actions Dynamic Actions provide a declarative mechanism for generating JavaScript to  provide client-side behaviors. Native actions include simple actions that show, hide,  enable, and disable page elements when a page item's value changes. More advanced  native actions include setting item values, executing JavaScript code, and executing  PL SQL code via AJAX calls.  Native actions work immediately for custom plug-ins based on simple DOM  elements, such as the NumberField plugin in Chapter 7, Working with Plug-ins  and Dynamic Actions. For plugins based on multiple DOM elements such as the  ComboBox, or the built-in APEX shuttle-box, some additional work has to be done  before the native dynamic actions will work correctly.  The following screenshot shows the before and after views of a dynamic action to  hide the three items in the region. The APEX Auto-complete item uses a simple  DOM text item, with the other two items being Ext ComboBoxes, each built using  multiple DOM elements.   The APEX-generated code for the Hide Item dynamic action references the APEX  item names, assuming the items are simple DOM elements. For ComboBoxes, this  results in the text item component being hidden, leaving the trigger icon visible.  Similarly, when using the Disable Item dynamic action, the text item component is  disabled, leaving the trigger icon still enabled! So, despite attempting to restrict users  from modifying the item, the trigger icon allows users to change the value.  Fortunately for us, the APEX team has addressed the issue when developing  complex native items, building the apex.widget.initPageItem function to  integrate plug-in items with the Dynamic Actions code seamlessly.  [ 252 ]   Chapter 8  Integrating plugins with the Dynamic Action  framework The apex.widget.initPageItem function definition is:  apex.widget.initPageItem = function  pName, pOptions  {     apex.item pName, pOptions ;     };  It accepts two parameters—the item name and an object literal containing callback  configurations for any or all of the functions: getValue, setValue, enable, disable,  show, hide, nullValue.  An example initialization for an item P1_MY_ITEM is:  apex.widget.initPageItem "P1_MY_ITEM", {     getValue: function  {},     setValue: function  {},     nullValue: "%null%" } ;  You would write suitable code for each of the functions shown to get and set the item  values. In this example, the nullValue doesn't use a function; instead, it is a simple  string value. The apex.widget.initPageItem function is located in the APEX installation files at  apex\images\javascript\uncompressed\apex_widget_4_0.js. Further examples  on its use can be seen in this file for some of the native APEX items.  The Ext.form.ComboBox already has methods for getValue, setValue, enable,  disable, show, and hide. Our task is to initialize a ComboBox with the Dynamic  Action framework, so that any code associated with the APEX item name will be  redirected to use functions referencing the ComboBox methods.  [ 253 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  Before writing the JavaScript, it's best to build a testing harness so that you can  validate your code as you go. The following screenshot shows the test page set   up for this example. Each of the Dynamic Actions modifies all of the items in the  region below.  The Dynamic Actions created are summarized in the following table:  Name  Set State  When  event Change   bind   When elements  P120_SET_STATE   Item   When  condition equal to:  Enabled  Set Item  Display  Change   bind   P120_SET_DISPLAY   Item   equal to: Show Show: when true  Set  Value  Change   bind   P120_SET_VALUE   Item   is not null  The ComboBox plugin we have created is rendered by first creating a simple   input text item and then using JavaScript to transform it into a ComboBox   using the applyTo attribute. This becomes the logical place to call the   apex.widget.initPageItem function.  Actions   Enable: when true  Disable: when false  Hide: when false  JavaScript Expression:  $v 'P120_SET_VALUE'   [ 254 ]   By overriding the standard ComboBox, this change can be made in the application  JavaScript library.  Chapter 8  Ext.override Ext.form.ComboBox, {   applyToMarkup: function el {     Ext.form.ComboBox.superclass.applyToMarkup.call this, el ;             remove APEX applied class     Ext.fly el .removeClass 'apex_disabled' ;             get the Ext id for the component     var x = this.getId  ;             Register customized standard actions for the         originating DOM element.        Original element has been replaced with ComboBox.     apex.widget.initPageItem el, {       getValue: function  {         return Ext.getCmp x .getValue  ;       },       setValue: function v {         Ext.getCmp x .setValue v ;       },       enable: function  {         Ext.getCmp x .enable  ;       },       disable: function  {         Ext.getCmp x .disable  ;       },       show: function  {         Ext.getCmp x .show  ;         Ext.select el + '-label' .show  ;       },       hide: function  {         Ext.getCmp x .hide  ;            Hide label            Relies on using label templates, and label naming            convention. Could check parent TD for label element            for this el, and parent's prev sibling TD for             label also.         Ext.select el + '-label' .hide  ;       }     } ;       [ 255 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions         trigger APEX DA event when value selected     this.on 'select', function o, record, index {       apex.jQuery '' + o.el.id .trigger 'select' ;     } ;   } } ;  The first few lines perform some basic housekeeping before we register our  customized dynamic actions.  Ext.override Ext.form.ComboBox, {   applyToMarkup: function el {     Ext.form.ComboBox.superclass.applyToMarkup.call this, el ;             remove APEX applied class     Ext.fly el .removeClass 'apex_disabled' ;  The highlighted line executes the standard applyToMarkup functionality for a  ComboBox, which doesn't reside in the ComboBox object, but resides a few levels up  the object inheritance hierarchy in the Component object.  APEX may have applied a apex_disabled class to the text item to be transformed  into a ComboBox, so it is necessary to remove the class.  We then fetch the ID of the ComboBox we are creating to use in subsequent   function calls.          get the Ext id for the component     var x = this.getId  ;             Register customized standard actions for the         originating DOM element.        Original element has been replaced with ComboBox.     apex.widget.initPageItem el, {       getValue: function  {         return Ext.getCmp x .getValue  ;       },       setValue: function v {         Ext.getCmp x .setValue v ;       },  The apex.widget.initPageItem function is called, passing the original APEX   item name in the el parameter, and defining the callback functions. Because Ext   has existing functions to enable disable, show hide, and set values, our task is   to redirect the code to the ComboBox using the Ext.getCmp x  call to select   the component.  [ 256 ]   Testing shows the ComboBox correctly performs the enable disable and   show hide actions. The setValue function works correctly for the local ComboBox,  but the following screenshot shows it does not retrieve the description for the AJAX  ComboBox, which needs to retrieve the data remotely from the database.  Chapter 8  To fix this, a second override needs to be made to the standard Ext.form.ComboBox,  this time modifying the setValue function. Typically, the override would be  included with the earlier override, but it can also be applied separately as done here.  Ext.override Ext.form.ComboBox, {   oneShot: false,   setValue: function v {     var text = v;     if  this.valueField  {       var r = this.findRecord this.valueField, v ;       if  r  {         this.oneShot = false;         text = r.data[this.displayField];       }       else {            do extra step for remote mode         if  this.mode == 'remote' && this.oneShot == false  {           this.oneShot = true;           this.store.on 'load',               this.setValue.createDelegate this, arguments ,                null, {                single: true           } ;           this.store.load {             params: {               'p_widget_num_return': v             }  [ 257 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions            } ;           return;         }         else {           this.oneShot = false;           if  Ext.isDefined this.valueNotFoundText   {             text = this.valueNotFoundText;           }         }       }     }     this.lastSelectionText = text;     if  this.hiddenField  {       this.hiddenField.value = Ext.value v, '' ;     }     Ext.form.ComboBox.superclass.setValue.call this, text ;     this.value = v;     return this;   } } ;              This time the highlighted code contains the modified functionality. When the  setValue function doesn't find the value cached in the JavaScript store, ComboBoxes  with remote stores will make one attempt to retrieve the display value from the  database via an AJAX request, setting this.oneShot = true; before loading the  data returned for the value passed by the parameter p_widget_num_return. The  store loads any returned records and executes the setValue function again using the  createDelegate function. Refer to the following screenshot, and you will realize  that the AJAX ComboBox now correctly shows the display value:  If the display value was still not found, the ComboBox uses default functionality to  show the valueNotFoundText text if configured, or the hidden value. Submitting  this value to the server would result in a validation error.  [ 258 ]    Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  The following screenshot shows a custom onSelect [Ext.form.ComboBox] event  added to a ComboBox item. It has a single action associated with it, when the event  is triggered, setting the value for another page item.  The details for the Set Value action are:  Identification  Dynamic Action: set_numberfield Action: Set Value  Execution options  Fire when event result is: True Fire on page load: Unchecked Stop execution on error: Checked  [ 260 ]   Settings  Set type: JavaScript Expression JavaScript expression: Ext.getCmp 'ext-' + this.triggeringElement. id .getValue  ;  Chapter 8  Affected elements  Selection type: Item s  Item s : P120_APEX_NUMBER_FIELD  From the details of the Set Value action, the JavaScript Expression used for settings is  slightly unusual. It relies on the naming convention that the ComboBox component  ID is the APEX item name prefixed with ext-, something set up in the PL SQL  package for our plug-in ComboBox.  Using the ComboBox component name, it returns the value of the ComboBox to the  Dynamic Actions framework, which populates the affected elements with the value.  This closes the loop for our ComboBox; it is now fully integrated to use standard  dynamic actions, as well as triggering custom actions that can affect other page items.  Summary In this chapter, we integrated the Ext ComboBox component into APEX. The  ComboBox is a data-aware component that uses Ext Data Stores to hold record-based  information in the browser client.  The ComboBox utilizes all aspects of creating a custom plug-in, implementing  render, AJAX, and validation callbacks. The plug-in makes use of many of the  standard attributes available to plug-ins, taking full advantage of the built-in LOV  functionality. It also uses custom attributes to expose additional parameters to the  developer, as well as a custom event to be used by Dynamic Actions.  The APEX provided PL SQL APIs for plug-ins greatly sped up the development of  the server-side functionality.   On the client side, the Ext ComboBox component was able to be integrated with the  Dynamic Actions framework using the apex.widget.initPageItem function to  declaratively override standard dynamic actions to show hide, enable disable and  get set values.   [ 261 ]   Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins, and Dynamic Actions  The functionality was integrated using the Ext.override method to add custom  code, and extend the existing functionality when setting values for ComboBoxes with  remote data stores.  We achieved a great deal in this chapter, covering many of the complexities of  integrating Ext components into APEX.  For our next challenge, we will look at integrating Ext JS GridPanels into APEX.  [ 262 ]   Getting Interactive with  GridPanels  GridPanels are, without doubt, one of the most powerful and most often-used  components within the Ext framework. Even the most basic implementations of   the GridPanel provide column management features including sorting, resizing,  drag-and-drop column reordering, and show hide columns.   Data presentation is handled separately from data retrieval within GridPanels,   with data retrieval done using a Data Store component. For GridPanels with paging  and remote sorting enabled, changes made on the client browser, such as hiding or  re-ordering columns, are automatically maintained when new data is loaded.   As if that's not impressive enough, GridPanels support plugins  not to be confused  with APEX Plug-ins , which allow additional functionality, such as expander rows  and "Group By" header menu options, to be integrated.   GridPanels provide a way for you to add functionality to your Classic Reports that's  currently only available in Interactive Reports, with the added advantage that you  can have multiple Classic Reports on one page.  In this chapter we will cover:   	 GridPanel components: Data Store, Column Model, Grid View, and    Selection Model   	 Key concepts for getting GridPanels into APEX  	 Creating a GridPanel Region Plug-in  	 Making a GridPanel Stateful  	 Using the GridPanel to convert Classic Reports   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  Components making up a GridPanel The Ext.grid.GridPanel brings together a number of other supporting components  to present data in a tabular format. Those components are the Store, Column model,  View, and Selection model.  Let's take a look at standalone example of the GridPanel to see how these supporting  components each play their part, before we attempt to integrate it into APEX.  We will be going through the code for the GridPanel shown in the previous  screenshot; it's also included in chapter09  ex-9-simple-grid.html.  The overall structure of the page is:        <!-- details snipped        Ext library includes    -->                                 Ext.onReady function   {  [ 264 ]   Chapter 9     ** details snipped        localJsonStore, columnModel, gridView, selectionModel    *      var grid = new Ext.grid.GridPanel {     id         : 'my-grid',     store      : localJsonStore,     colModel   : columnModel,     view       : gridView,     selModel   : selectionModel,     height     : 260,     width      : 450,     renderTo   : 'gridRegion',     stripeRows : true,     title      : 'Commonwealth Games 2010 Medal Talley'   } ; } ;         The overall structure of our standalone page is really quite straightforward. The header  includes the usual Ext library and CSS includes, and the body of the page contains a  DIV region with ID of gridRegion, into which our GridPanel will be rendered. JavaScript code instantiates a new Ext.grid.GridPanel object, specifying parameters  in an object literal. The highlighted parameters for store, colModel, view, and  selModel reference other Ext components created earlier in the script, but not shown.  The entire script is enclosed by a Ext.onReady function call, so that the code is  executed as early as possible, ensuring variables are declared in a local namespace.  Okay, so that's the 10,000 feet view of GridPanel; let's look at the referenced  components individually.  Defining the Data Store The first thing we need to do is store our data locally in the HTML page in a   Data Store.  var myData = {   records : [     {c1:1,  c2:"Australia",          gold:74, silver:55, bronze:48, total:177},     {c1:2,  c2:"India",          [ 265 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels       gold:38, silver:27, bronze:36, total:101},     {c1:3,  c2:"England",            gold:37, silver:60, bronze:45, total:142},     {c1:4,  c2:"Canada",             gold:26, silver:17, bronze:33, total:76 },     {c1:5,  c2:"South Africa",       gold:12, silver:11, bronze:10, total:33 },                       ** snipped **      {c1:35, c2:"Bangladesh",         gold:0,  silver:0,  bronze:1,  total:1  },     {c1:35, c2:"Saint Lucia",        gold:0,  silver:0,  bronze:1,  total:1  }   ] };     Fields definition var fields = [   {name: 'rank',   mapping: 'c1' },   {name: 'name',   mapping: 'c2' },   {name: 'gold',   mapping: 'gold' },   {name: 'silver', mapping: 'silver' },   {name: 'bronze', mapping: 'bronze' },   {name: 'total',  mapping: 'total' } ];     create the data store var localJsonStore = new Ext.data.JsonStore {   fields : fields,   data   : myData,   root   : 'records' } ;  We first introduced the Data Store in Chapter 8, Data Stores, AJAX-enabled Plug-ins,  and Dynamic Actions, so this should look very familiar to you. This time we are  using Ext.data.JsonStore object, which comes pre-configured with a specific  DataReader to read data structured in a JSON format. The JsonStore needs two things—the data itself that we are passing by reference with  the myData variable, and a description of the data done using the fields variable.   A reader built into the JsonStore interprets the data using the fields definition. The  root property in the JsonStore is required by the DataReader to identify the name of  the property containing the Array of row objects.  [ 266 ]   We have used minimal information in our field definitions here, just including an  optional mapping expression to reference the data from an element of the data item's  root Array.   The fields definition could be simplified even further; the mapping value defaults  to the name value, so can be rewritten as:  Chapter 9      var fields = [         {name: 'rank',   mapping : 'c1' },         {name: 'name',   mapping : 'c2' },         'gold','silver','bronze','total'     ];  A more complex field definition could contain information such as data type, date  format, default value, sort direction, and more; for example:  { name:'myDate', mapping:'d1', type:'date', dateFormat:"Y-m-d g:i:s  A", allowBlank: false }  So now that we have defined our data and described how to interpret the data, we  need to configure how the data is to be displayed.  Configuring the Column Model The Ext.grid.ColumnModel is used by the GridPanel to configure how and what  parts of the data will be displayed.  var cols = [   {header:"Rank",    width:50,  dataIndex:'rank'},   {header:"Country", width:160, dataIndex:'name', id:'auto-expand'},   {header:"Gold",    width:50,  dataIndex:'gold'},   {header:"Silver",  width:50,  dataIndex:'silver'},   {header:"Bronze",  width:50,  dataIndex:'bronze'},   {header:"Total",   width:50,  dataIndex:'total'} ];  var cm = new Ext.grid.ColumnModel {   defaults: {     sortable: true   },   columns: cols } ;  Display information for the columns is created here using an Array of Ext.grid. Column column configuration objects to define the initial layout and display of the  columns in the GridPanel.   [ 267 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  Here, we have included basic display information, being the header and width  config options, and a dataIndex containing the name of the field in the records  contained in the GridPanel's Store. As usual, Ext has many more config options, such  as align, editable, fixed width, hidden, resizable, sortable, and so on. We have used an object definition to define our ColumnModel, passing it the  defaults config property for all columns to be sortable, as well as the columns Array.  Defining the GridView The Ext.grid.GridView encapsulates the user interface of the GridPanel. It is  responsible for rendering the outer components of the GridPanel and co-ordinating  the rendering of the columns using the ColumnModel. It also manages events  for the grid such as firing an update event when a record is modified or firing the  datachanged event when the Data Store performs a load.     view is automatically created when not specified var gridView = new Ext.grid.GridView {     forceFit: true } ;  Only one config option has been specified in this example—setting forceFit to  true to ensure that the column widths are automatically sized, so that all displayed  columns occupy the full width of the grid at all times. So, if a column is resized  manually or programmatically, the other columns are automatically adjusted to fit  the grid width.  Most of the time, the config options you will be interested in are forceFit and  autoFill; the remaining config options are more relevant if you are writing a new  component extending the GridView. While the GridView is an important piece of  the solution, hardly any of the GridPanel examples provided by Sencha include it in  their configs; the GridView is always created, even when not explicitly specified.  Defining the Selection Model The selection model for GridPanels determines how rows and cells are selected,  and how many can be selected at a time. Ext provides RowSelectionModel,  ColumnSelectionModel, and a CheckboxSelectionModel, which enable selecting  records using checkboxes at the beginning of a row.   [ 268 ]   Chapter 9  Each selection model provides methods to retrieve the selected elements. For  example, RowSelectionModel provides getSelected to retrieve the first selected  row, and getSelections to retrieve an Array of selected records.      var selectionModel = new Ext.grid.RowSelectionModel {         singleSelect:true     } ;  Our example uses a RowSelectionModel, with a config option to allow only a single  record to be selected.  The choice of selection model will be largely dependent on the needs of your  application. It's best to be consistent and limit yourself to only one or two selection  models, so it's immediately apparent to the user what model you're using. For  example, always limit row selection to a single record, and use the checkbox  selection model for multiple rows.  To demonstrate how to use a different Selection Model, change our example to use  CheckBoxSelectionModel by modifying the following piece of code:      var checkboxSM = new Ext.grid.CheckboxSelectionModel  ;      var cols = [         checkboxSM,         {header: "Rank",    width: 50,  dataIndex: 'rank'},         {header: "Country", width: 160, dataIndex: 'name', id : 'auto- expand'},         {header: "Gold",    width: 50,  dataIndex: 'gold'},         {header: "Silver",  width: 50,  dataIndex: 'silver'},         {header: "Bronze",  width: 50,  dataIndex: 'bronze'},         {header: "Total",   width: 50,  dataIndex: 'total'}     ];  Add the line declaring the checkboxSM variable before the cols definition and also  include the reference to the checkboxSM in the cols definition. This adds a checkbox  column to our list of columns  Then change the GridPanel declaration to use checkboxSM as the selection model.      var myGrid = new Ext.grid.GridPanel {         id               : 'my-grid',         store            : localJsonStore,         colModel         : columnModel,         view             : gridView,         selModel         : checkboxSM,           autoExpandColumn : 'auto-expand',  [ 269 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels          height           : 260,         width            : 450,         renderTo         : 'gridRegion',         stripeRows       : true,         title            : 'Commonwealth Games 2010 Medal Talley'     } ;  The result of our changes can be seen in the following screenshot; a checkbox column  has been added to the beginning of the grid, shown here with multiple rows selected.  We have now covered each of the major supporting components of a GridPanel:   	 Store: Model that holds and describes the data records  	 Column model: Used to describe how the data is displayed in  the GridPanel  	 View: Renders GridPanel and manages GridPanel events  	 Selection model: Controls the selection behavior when a row or column    is selected.  Built-in features Our basic example of the GridPanel already includes column management   features, including sorting, resizing, drag-and-drop column reordering, and   show hide columns.  [ 270 ]   Chapter 9  The preceding screenshot shows the Total column being moved to another position  using a drag-and-drop action; releasing the mouse would complete the action and  relocate the column.  The previous screenshot shows the Total column in its new position, along with a  column header menu containing sorting options and a checkbox list of columns to hide  or show columns. Notice that the Rank column has been unchecked, and is now hidden.  These features, as well as resizing columns, are out of the box for GridPanels and  are configurable to enable disable the functionality. They really do enhance the user  interface, giving a far more interactive experience.  We now need to work out how to integrate the GridPanel into APEX.  [ 271 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  Getting the GridPanel into APEX It's possible to implement GridPanels in APEX in more than one way, with solutions  varying from extremes of using almost no APEX functionality to relying mainly on  APEX functionality.    	 Almost no APEX approach:  An example of an "Almost no APEX" approach would be to create a plug-in  region where you define the SQL query, and use no more standard APEX  functionality. The solution would rely totally on the plug-in functionality  written by you to manage the GridPanel.  Using the query, you could quite easily generate the datastore, the column  headings based on the column aliases for the query. We have mostly written  this already in Chapter 8, using the code for the ComboBox. So, what about sorting and pagination? Okay, well you would need to write  some functionality to pass sorting requests from the GridPanel through to  your plug-ins AJAX function, and extend your code to support sorting   and pagination. Good, so what about format masks on columns—you can do that in Classic  Reports. And while we're on the topic, what about column formatting,  column links, link validation, authorization, and conditional display logic? This is starting to sound like a whole lot of work. Before you know it,   you're going to be writing a whole "shadow" API, just to duplicate  functionality in APEX.  Then you will have to figure out some way to maintain it. Are you going to  do it declaratively? If so, you will need to build an application to support it,  and after that you'll need to build an API to migrate your metadata when  you promote it from DEV to TEST to PROD. Okay, so maybe this isn't such a great idea—let's look at another alternative.   	 Relying on APEX approach:  This approach is built on the simple premise that APEX already provides a  lot of functionality for you already. All you are doing is extending what's  already there. This is the approach I want to show you for the GridPanel. It's a more  sustainable solution long term, because you're working within the APEX  product, which is supported by a whole team of developers who are trying to  make your job easier.  Perhaps in some future release the functionality we are adding will be   native to APEX. Our task then will be to swap over the plug-in with the  native component.  [ 272 ]   Chapter 9  Testing the concepts first Before we embark down the path of building our solution, let's first have a look at  the key concepts we are going to use.  Converting APEX-generated table into a GridPanel One of the Sencha-provided examples is the From Markup Grid Example, found in  the Ext JS SDK under  examples grid from-markup.html file. It converts a simple  HTML markup table, shown in the left-hand side of the following screenshot, and  transforms it into the GridPanel shown on the right-hand side.              The JavaScript to transform the table is:  var grid = new Ext.ux.grid.TableGrid "the-table", {     stripeRows: true } ; grid.render  ;  It's simply calling a custom Ext.ux.grid.TableGrid component, passing the ID of  the table to transform and a config object literal.  The smarts are in the TableGrid component, shown here with comments.  Ext.ux.grid.TableGrid = function table, config {     config = config      {};     Ext.apply this, config ;     var cf = config.fields  [], ch = config.columns  [];     table = Ext.get table ;          var ct = table.insertSibling  ;  [ 273 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  After assigning the config object literal to this object and a reference to the table, a  new DIV element is inserted into the DOM as a sibling of the markup table. This will  later be used as the target to render the TableGrid into.      var fields = [], cols = [];     var headers = table.query "thead th" ;     for  var i = 0, h; h = headers[i]; i++  {         var text = h.innerHTML;         var name = 'tcol-' + i;                  fields.push Ext.applyIf cf[i]          {}, {             name: name,             mapping: 'td:nth ' +  i + 1  + '  @innerHTML'         }  ;                  cols.push Ext.applyIf ch[i]          {}, {             'header': text,             'dataIndex': name,             'width': h.offsetWidth,             'tooltip': h.title,             'sortable': true         }  ;     }     var ds = new Ext.data.Store {         reader: new Ext.data.XmlReader {             record: 'tbody tr'         }, fields      } ;          ds.loadData table.dom ;          var cm = new Ext.grid.ColumnModel cols ;  The Field model for the Data Store is built by querying the DOM, using the table  header cells to generate fields and mapping them to the innerHTML of a table cell  using: mapping : 'td:nth ' +  i + 1  + '  @innerHTML'.  The Data Store here uses an XMLReader to read the table rows in applying the  mapping expression to load the data, accomplished using the statement:  ds.loadData table.dom ;  [ 274 ]   Chapter 9  The Column Model is also built when querying the DOM table header cells.       if  config.width  config.height  {         ct.setSize config.width  'auto', config.height  'auto' ;     }     else {         ct.setWidth table.getWidth   ;     }          if  config.remove !== false  {         table.remove  ;     }            Ext.applyIf this, {         'ds': ds,         'cm': cm,         'sm': new Ext.grid.RowSelectionModel  ,         autoHeight: true,         autoWidth: false     } ;     Ext.ux.grid.TableGrid.superclass.constructor.call this, ct, {} ; };  Ext.extend Ext.ux.grid.TableGrid, Ext.grid.GridPanel ;  The width and height is then determined for the TableGrid—either passed using  config properties or using the width of the markup table. The Ext.applyIf  command is used to configure the TableGrid components if not already specified;  the Datastore, Column model, and Selection model components are assigned at this  time. Finally, the TableGrid superclass  GridPanel  is called to continue creating a  standard GridPanel. Idea: Use APEX report table as local Data Store We can use a similar approach to the TableGrid to transform an APEX Classic Report  into a GridPanel. To see how well the TableGrid works, include a script reference to  the Sencha-provided JavaScript in a page header:  <script type="text javascript" src=" ux extjs examples ux TableGrid. js">   [ 275 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  Then modify the report Id to match your report, and run the following JavaScript  from the FireBug console:  var grid = new Ext.ux.grid.TableGrid "report_R3369531070222725", {     stripeRows: true    stripe alternate rows } ;  grid.render  ;  The following screenshot shows the result after transforming our "fake" report region  template from Chapter 5, Ext Themed Buttons, Popups, Calendars, and Reports. Not a  bad result for zero effort. Columns now have menus and can be resized, hidden, and  swapped around using drag-and-drop.   A few minor issues need fixing, such as the drop-down menu has a sorting indicator  next to the ID column. This is because the image was part of the header converted  using the innerHTML mapping. The header labels still include the original APEX  header hyperlinks making sorting a little confusing, depending on which part of the  header is clicked data is either locally sorted, or remote sorted.  Pagination still uses the template links and changes the GridPanel back into a  standard report. Any changes to the column layout are lost.  Instead of using the table header to determine the Column model, we can query the  APEX metadata for the report for the same information. This is more reliable, and  also means we don't need to strip out unwanted elements from the header, just like  the sort image and the JavaScript calls to do column sorting.  [ 276 ]   Chapter 9  Retrieving the content of a table cell using the DOM innerHTML method means  there is no extra work needed to be done regardless of the cells' content. So, if  the markup table cell contains a hyperlink defined through the APEX builder, it  continues to work unchanged. It's not necessary to do any additional work to define  an Ext "select" event.  So, using the TableGrid as a starting point looks very good once we sort   out pagination.  GridPanel pagination using APEX Partial Page  Refreshes Our GridPanel will use the rendered table for the initial page load; once transformed,  it will continue to use standard APEX Partial Page Refreshes  PPR  to retrieve  additional records. We need to call the standard APEX pagination routines,  retrieving the results to load into the GridPanel's Data Store before presenting   the results to the user.  When APEX does a Partial Page Refresh, it executes JavaScript to create an  XMLHttpRequest object, issuing an HTTP Post request. Details of the request,  including the parameters making up the request can be seen in the Firebug console,  as shown in the following screenshot:   [ 277 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  Using this information, we can create an Ext.Ajax.request, passing the same  parameters and then capturing the server response.  var regionId = "3369531070222725";  Ext.Ajax.request {     url: 'f',     params: {         'p': Ext.getDom 'pFlowId' .value +         ':' + Ext.getDom 'pFlowStepId' .value +         ':' + Ext.getDom 'pInstance' .value +         ':FLOW_PPR_OUTPUT_R' + regionId + '_pg_R_' +              regionId +':NO',         'pg_max_rows': 10,         'pg_min_row': 11,         'pg_rows_fetched': 10     },     success: function response, opts {         Ext.Msg.show {            title: 'AJAX Response',            msg: response.responseText,            width: 450         } ;     },     failure: function response, opts {         console.log 'server-side failure with status code ' +                                     response.status ;     } } ;  The parameters passed in the HTTP request are built up using the form details   on the APEX page, retrieving values for the application, page, and session using  Ext.getDom   calls.  [ 278 ]   AJAX server requests are asynchronous, meaning the JavaScript code will have  completed before the response is received. A callback function is required to process  any returned data. Ext provides config options for both success and failure options;  here responseText is utilized as a modal Ext.MessageBox message for successful  responses, as can be seen in the following screenshot:  Chapter 9  So, with very little effort so far, we have verified that we can transform a Classic  Report into a GridPanel using the output of the report, and also execute APEX  pagination calls and retrieve the response for further JavaScript manipulation.  It's time to put our solution together.  GridPanel as a region plug-in We are building a GridPanel as a region plugin, using it as a container for a Classic  Report region, as APEX doesn't support defining reports directly into region plugins.  [ 279 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  The intention is for the Plug-in to transform a single Classic Report included as  a sub-region into a GridPanel, using the metadata for the report and its column  definitions to define the columns and data store for the grid. The following  screenshot shows an example page in the APEX Application Builder:  Our GridPanel plug-in has a very simple definition with just a few custom attributes.  All the complexity is contained in the database package and the associated JavaScript.  Plug-in definition The new functionality will be covered in greater detail; the full source for the  database package and JavaScript can be found in the Chapter 9 source code files  available on the Packt site.  Plugin name:  Ext.apex.TableGrid  Callbacks: Render Function Name:   AJAX Function Name:     plug_ext_tablegrid.render  plug_ext_tablegrid.ajax  [ 280 ]   Chapter 9  Standard attributes: None  Custom attributes:  Label Totals Calculation  Method Totals Function  Width  px  Collapsible  Type Select List  Required Depending on Yes  Values auto,  function  Default auto  Totals Calculation  Method  PL SQL  Function  Body Number Select List  Yes  No Yes  true, false  true  The Totals Calculation Method has two options, auto and function; these options  need a little explaining.  Data Stores with remote data sources need to know the total number of records in  the dataset as returned by the server. This is used to manage the pagination bar at  the bottom of a GridPanel, shown in the following screenshot:  APEX doesn't publish the total record count for a Classic Report, so the plugin needs  to provide this functionality. For the auto option, this is done by wrapping the  Classic Report's query with a select count *  statement:  select count *  from  original query   This is done when the page is rendered, adding an additional query to the  performance overhead of the page. If the original query is expensive, developers can  set the calculation method to function and define an anonymous PL SQL function  returning the total rows value using some other calculation method.  [ 281 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  Plug-in package The package specification for a Region plug-in is very similar to an Item plug-in—the  differences being the datatypes of the parameters and that Region plug-ins don't  have a validation function.  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE plug_ext_tablegrid AS     function render         p_region              in apex_plugin.t_region      ,p_plugin              in apex_plugin.t_plugin      ,p_is_printer_friendly in boolean            return apex_plugin.t_region_render_result;     function ajax         p_region in apex_plugin.t_region      ,p_plugin in apex_plugin.t_plugin            return apex_plugin.t_region_ajax_result;  END plug_ext_tablegrid;    We will look at the details of each function separately; the full package body and  specification are included in the Chapter 9 files included with the book.  Render functionality for the GridPanel plug-in The GridPanel render function is used primarily to generate JavaScript to instantiate  a TableGrid, passing the column and field mappings, together with some other  settings in config object to transform the markup table.   It uses APEX metadata to generate this content; the output will look like the  following JavaScript:  Ext.onReady function  {    new Ext.apex.TableGrid "report_R3369531070222725", {       apexMinRow:1,       apexPageSize:10,       apexPluginId:"20F91201D0AC...1D996C7D5A1A2D36",       apexTotalRows:36,       collapsible:true,       columns:[          {dataIndex:"c1", header:"Id", width:82, hidden:true},  [ 282 ]   Chapter 9           {dataIndex:"c2", header:"Ranking", width:82},          {dataIndex:"c7", header:"Total", width:82},          {dataIndex:"c3", header:"Country", width:204},          {dataIndex:"c4", header:"Gold", width:82},          {dataIndex:"c5", header:"Silver", width:82},          {dataIndex:"c6", header:"Bronze", width:82}       ],       fields:[          {name:"c1", mapping:"td:nth 1  @innerHTML"},          {name:"c2", mapping:"td:nth 2  @innerHTML"},          {name:"c3", mapping:"td:nth 3  @innerHTML"},          {name:"c4", mapping:"td:nth 4  @innerHTML"},          {name:"c5", mapping:"td:nth 5  @innerHTML"},          {name:"c6", mapping:"td:nth 6  @innerHTML"},          {name:"c7", mapping:"td:nth 7  @innerHTML"}       ],       id:"my-grid",       regionId:"3369531070222725",       sortInfo:{field:"c2", direction:"DESC"},       title:"Commonwealth Games 2010 Medal Talley",       width:617    } ; } ;  The JavaScript should look quite familiar, as it is similar to the standalone GridPanel  example we saw earlier in the chapter. Here, we are instantiating a custom  TableGrid, passing a mix of standard and custom config options in an object literal.   The fields array shows the column aliases c1 to c7 for the markup table returned  by APEX with a simple mapping rule defining how to extract the column data.  Notice that the highlighted line, dataIndex c7, is out of sequence, in position 3. The  user has re-arranged the column order using drag-and-drop, and this information  has been saved to the database for later retrieval. Other stateful attributes include  column widths, column hidden attribute, sort information, and the GridPanel width  are also included.  The PL SQL code for the render function is:  FUNCTION render      p_region              in apex_plugin.t_region   ,p_plugin              in apex_plugin.t_plugin   ,p_is_printer_friendly in boolean      return apex_plugin.t_region_render_result is  [ 283 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels     type t_type is table of pls_integer index by varchar2 255 ;

Some convenience routines, such as push, escape_json and get_properties  have been reused, so no need to discuss those either.  New subroutines added are get_grid_report_properties and fetch_config.   The get_grid_report_properties procedure retrieves details for the report and  report columns by querying the APEX views: APEX_APPLICATION_PAGE_REGIONS  and APEX_APPLICATION_PAGE_RPT_COLS. It's very straightforward, so just look at  the source code included with this chapter if you want to see the details.  The fetch_config procedure retrieves some custom preferences we will be creating  using the plug-in's ajax function, so we will look at that a little later when we  discuss the ajax function.  Calculating the number of rows for TableGrid is somewhat of a necessary evil. From  an APEX perspective, it's generally recommended not to do this for report regions,  as it adds a performance overhead to the query by requiring it to process the entire  result set to count the number of records returned. However, we need to do this for  the Ext pagination functionality to work for the Data Store.  To address the potential performance issue, we defined two ways of calculating the  number of records returned.     -- Calculate apexTotalRows    if p_region.attribute_01 = 'auto' then       for rec in  select r.region_source                     from apex_application_page_regions r                    where r.region_id = l_rpt_region_id                     [ 288 ]   Chapter 9        loop          l_total_rows :=             wwv_flow_plugin_util.get_plsql_function_result                 p_plsql_function =>                'declare n number; '                'begin select count *  into n from  '                rec.region_source' ; return n; end;'              ;       end loop;    else       l_total_rows :=          wwv_flow_plugin_util.get_plsql_function_result              p_plsql_function => p_region.attribute_02           ;    end if;  The first method automatically calculates total rows returned by wrapping the   report query with a select count *  statement in an anonymous function,   shown highlighted in the code snippet. The second method allows the developer  to specify a custom function possibly to improve performance, as shown in the  following screenshot:              The built-in WWV_FLOW_PLUGIN_UTIL.GET_PLSQL_FUNCTION_RESULT function allows  developers to use bind variables in exactly the same way as they would for any  standard APEX code region.  [ 289 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels Minor pagination issue APEX is stateful when paginating using Partial Page Refresh  PPR  report, but does  not make the starting row information accessible to developers in the public APEX  PL SQL packages.   This causes problems if a user has PPR report and paginates to, say page 2 with 10  records per page, and then does a page refresh from the browser. APEX has saved  the state of the PPR report, recording that it needs to display records starting from  row 11 of the result set.  The PPR report renders the records from row 11 onwards, however, there is no way  for our custom plug-in to identify we haven't returned records from the first row.  This results in the TableGrid recording incorrect information in its pagination bar.  I've raised this as an issue with the APEX development team, and it is being  considered for a release after APEX 4.02.  In the mean time, the workaround is to reset pagination every time the page  is refreshed. This changes APEX behavior for a normal report region, but is an  acceptable solution.  To do this for a single page, create an unconditional page process to Reset  Pagination for the Current Page at the process point On Load - Before Regions, as  shown in the following screenshot:  Alternatively, you can create a similar page process on APEX Page 0, to conditionally  reset pagination on pages containing the TableGrid plug-in.  [ 290 ]   Chapter 9  AJAX functionality for the GridPanel plug-in Recall from our earlier investigations for the plug-in that we are going to call the  standard APEX routines for pagination and sorting, meaning we don't require any  AJAX processing for standard functionality.  However, the TableGrid now supports drag-and-drop column ordering, menu  options to show or hide columns, and column resizing. You can imagine your users  are very quickly going to demand that APEX remember these settings also!  So, our TableGrid will be using AJAX functionality to remember the layout state. To  implement this, we are adding two toolbar items to the panel header, shown in the  following screenshot, to save the settings and also restore default settings.  The PL SQL code for the AJAX function is:  FUNCTION ajax      p_region in apex_plugin.t_region   ,p_plugin in apex_plugin.t_plugin      return apex_plugin.t_region_ajax_result is    l_result apex_plugin.t_region_ajax_result; BEGIN    -- indicate we are returning application json data    wwv_flow_plugin_util.print_json_http_header;     -- direct to sub-routine    case apex_application.g_widget_action  [ 291 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels        when 'saveConfig' then          save_config  p_region_id => p_region.id ;       when 'resetConfig' then          reset_config  p_region_id => p_region.id ;       else          -- invalid action          raise_application_error -20001,'Invalid action: "'            apex_application.g_widget_action'"'           ;    end case;     -- not used by APEX yet    return l_result;  EXCEPTION    when others then       htp.p '{success: false,' ;       htp.p ' errors: {"sqlCode": "'               escape_json sqlcode '",' ;       htp.p '          "sqlErrm": "'               escape_json sqlerrm '"' ;       htp.p '         }' ;       htp.p '}' ;       return l_result; END;  The AJAX function here just prints a mime-type header, and directs requests to the  appropriate subroutine.  Saving modifications is done using the save_config procedure:  procedure save_config  p_region_id in number  is    l_prefix varchar2  255  :=       'EXT_'v 'APP_ID' '_'v 'APP_PAGE_ID' '_'       p_region_id'_'; begin    wwv_flow_preferences.set_preference         p_preference => l_prefix  'PANEL_WIDTH'      ,p_value      => apex_application.g_x01     ;    wwv_flow_preferences.set_preference         p_preference => l_prefix  'COL'      ,p_value      => wwv_flow_utilities.table_to_string2                          apex_application.g_f01      ;  [ 292 ]   Chapter 9     wwv_flow_preferences.set_preference         p_preference => l_prefix  'WIDTH'      ,p_value      => wwv_flow_utilities.table_to_string2                          apex_application.g_f02      ;    wwv_flow_preferences.set_preference         p_preference => l_prefix  'HIDDEN'      ,p_value      => wwv_flow_utilities.table_to_string2                          apex_application.g_f03      ;    htp.p '{success: true}' ; end;  Here, we are saving values passed in an AJAX request into the database using the  built-in wwv_flow_preferences.set_preference procedure. These values are  stored by APEX in the WWV_FLOW_PREFERENCES$ table, and persist across both page  requests and sessions.  We are storing the panel width, displayed columns, column widths, and hidden  columns. The column-based fields use associative arrays  index by tables , so need  to be converted into varchar2 strings using the wwv_flow_utilities.table_to_ string2 procedure.  The preference names and values stored in the database look like those shown in the   next table:  Parameter EXT_103_145_3371020966238884_PANEL_WIDTH EXT_103_145_3371020966238884_COL EXT_103_145_3371020966238884_WIDTH EXT_103_145_3371020966238884_HIDDEN  Value 425 c1:c2:c7:c3:c4:c5:c6 82:82:57:121:52:53:56 true::::::  Interpreting the values shown for the COL parameter, column 7  c7  has been  repositioned next to column 2  c2 . Also, looking at the HIDDEN parameter, the first  column  c1  has been hidden.  Complementing the save_config procedure are procedures fetch_config  and reset_config; we won't show these here as their purpose is self-evident.  These procedures use APEX-supplied procedures wwv_flow_preferences. set_preference, wwv_flow_utilities.string_to_table2, and wwv_flow_ preferences.remove_preference.   Let's turn our attention to the JavaScript for our TableGrid.  [ 293 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  Building a custom DataReader Ext provides multiple Readers for reading structured data from a data source and  converting it into an object containing Ext.data.Record objects and metadata for use  by an Ext.data.Store. However, to integrate with APEX, we need to create a custom DataReader.  Fortunately, this isn't too hard, because we can extend an existing DataReader to  meet our needs:  Ext.ns 'Ext.apex.data' ; Ext.apex.data.HtmlReader = Ext.extend Ext.data.XmlReader, {   read: function response {     var doc = Ext.DomHelper.createDom {       html: response.responseText     } ;     if  !doc  {       throw {         message: "XmlReader.read: XML Document not available"       };     }     return this.readRecords doc ;   },   readRecords: function doc {     this.xmlData = doc;      var root = doc,         totalRecords = this.meta.apexTotalRecords  0;      var records = this.extractData          Ext.DomQuery.select this.meta.record, root , true ;     return {       success: true,       records: records,       totalRecords:  totalRecords  records.length     };   } } ;  In this snippet, we are extending the Ext.data.XmlReader, which expects   AJAX responses to be returned with the header in the HTTP response set to   text xml or application xml, and the XML document contained in a property   named responseXML.  For the TableGrid paging bar to display the total records and paginate correctly,  the custom Reader also needs to have totalRecords assigned. This is done when the  custom Reader is instantiated using the meta.apexTotalRecords parameter, as  APEX doesn't pass this information with the PPR refresh.  [ 294 ]    Getting Interactive with GridPanels  Our Reader object is then instantiated using the custom HtmlReader component  we created earlier. This will read the table rows and cells passed by the APEX PPR  refresh responses into a data store.    var myReader = new Ext.apex.data.HtmlReader {     apexTotalRecords: config.apexTotalRows  null,     record: 'tbody tr'   }, fields ;  The Data Store is the next object to be defined. Parameter names and values are  assigned to match correctly with the parameters expected by APEX.     create the data store var ds = new Ext.data.Store {   url: 'f',   baseParams: {     'p': Ext.getDom 'pFlowId' .value + ':' +             Ext.getDom 'pFlowStepId' .value + ':' +             Ext.getDom 'pInstance' .value +             ':FLOW_PPR_OUTPUT_R' + config.regionId + '_',     'pg_max_rows': config.apexPageSize  15,     'pg_rows_fetched': config.apexPageSize  15   },   remoteSort: true,   sortInfo: config.sortInfo,   paramNames: {     start: 'pg_min_row',      limit: 'pg_max_rows'   },   reader: myReader,   listeners: {     beforeload: function obj, options {          APEX uses 1 based rowcount, so adjust       if  options.params && options.params.pg_min_row >= 0  {         options.params.pg_min_row += 1;       }        if  !options.params  !options.params.sort            !this.prevSortInfo            options.params.sort == this.prevSortInfo.field &&           options.params.dir == this.prevSortInfo.direction        {         options.params.p = ds.baseParams.p + 'pg_R_' +                             config.regionId +':NO';       }  [ 296 ]   Chapter 9        else {         var sortConfig = 'fsp_sort_' +                           options.params.sort.substring 1 ;         if  options.params.dir == 'ASC'  {           sortConfig += '_desc';         }          options = Ext.apply options, {           params: {             p: ds.baseParams.p + sortConfig + '::RP',             fsp_region_id: config.regionId,             pg_min_row: options.params.pg_min_row  1           }         } ;       }          always remove sort params       delete options.params.sort;       delete options.params.dir;     },      load: function obj, records, options {          APEX uses 1 based rowcount, so adjust       if  options.params && options.params.pg_min_row > 0  {         options.params.pg_min_row -= 1;       }          store sort details to help identify sort requests       this.prevSortInfo = Ext.apply {}, this.sortInfo ;     }   } } ;  Next data is loaded from the HTML markup table created when the page   was rendered.     ds.loadData table.dom ;  Following this, we complete the configuration of a typical GridPanel by assembling a  PagingToolbar, ColumnModel, and the height and width attributes.    var paging = new Ext.PagingToolbar {     pageSize: config.apexPageSize  15,     store: ds,     displayInfo: true,     displayMsg: 'Displaying rows {0} - {1} of {2}'   } ;  [ 297 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels    var cm = new Ext.grid.ColumnModel {     defaults: {       sortable: true,       menuDisabled: false     },     columns: cols   } ;    if  config.width  config.height  {     ct.setSize config.width  'auto', config.height  'auto' ;   }   else {     ct.setWidth table.getWidth   ;   }  The markup table is then deleted from the DOM, and all the components making up  the GridPanel are assigned to the object.    table.remove  ;    Ext.applyIf this, {     'ds': ds,     'cm': cm,     'sm': new Ext.grid.RowSelectionModel  ,     bbar: paging   } ;  At this point, all that's left to do is call the constructor function to create   the TableGrid.       @todo - add tools to save TableGrid state    Ext.apex.TableGrid.superclass.constructor.call this, ct ; };  Ext.extend Ext.apex.TableGrid, Ext.grid.GridPanel ;  Notice the @todo comment; we will be adding more code here to make the   TableGrid stateful.  [ 298 ]   Making the TableGrid Stateful Before we make the TableGrid stateful, let's add one more piece of functionality to  make the TableGrid resizable. Add the following code before the @todo comment:  Chapter 9       add listener to resize TableGrid width   Ext.applyIf this, {     listeners: {       render: function p {         new Ext.Resizable p.getEl  , {           handles: 'e',           pinned: true,           transparent: true,           resizeElement: function  {             var box = this.proxy.getBox  ;             p.updateBox box ;             if  p.layout  {               p.doLayout  ;             }             return box;           }         } ;       }     }   } ;              This adds a listener to the TableGrid, so when it is rendered, an Ext.Resizable  object is wrapped around the TableGrid to make it resizable, as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 299 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  Ext.Panels support an array of tool button configs to be added to the header tool  area. We are adding the two extra tool items to the panel header, as seen in the  previous screenshot, and then adding handlers to pass AJAX requests back to the  database.  The structure of the code looks like the following, with just the details needing to be  added to the handlers.  The code to "save settings" is more complicated, so we will look at that here:  var tools = [{   id: 'restore',   qtip: 'Restore default settings',     handler: function event, toolEl, panel {            restore logic     } }, {   id: 'save',   qtip: 'Save settings',     handler: function event, toolEl, panel {            save logic     } }] Ext.apply this, {   tools: tools } ;  {   id: 'save',   qtip: 'Save settings',   handler: function e, toolEl, panel {     var f01 = [], f02 = [], f03 = [];      var cfg = panel.getColumnModel  .config;         capture column, width, hidden     for  var i = 0, c; c = cfg[i]; i++  {       f01[i] = c.dataIndex;       f02[i] = c.width;       f03[i] = c.scope.hidden  null;     }  [ 300 ]   We start out by creating three empty arrays, then populating them with details from  the panels column model retrieved using panel.getColumnModel  .config. The  dataIndex, width, and hidden state are loaded into the arrays, which would look  like the following when populated:  Chapter 9  f01[c1,c2,c7,c3,c4,c5,c6] f02[82,82,57,121,52,53,56] f03[true,,,,,,]  This data, together with other parameters and APEX application, page, session, and  request information is bundled into an Ext.Ajax.request object and submitted to  the database for processing by our TableGrid plug-in code. Callback functions for  success and failure states then display a message to the user.      Ext.Ajax.request {       url: 'wwv_flow.show',       success: function  {         Ext.Msg.alert 'Message',                       'Panel configuration saved.' ;       },       failure: function  {           Ext.Msg.show {              title:'Error',              msg: 'Process failed.',              buttons: Ext.Msg.OK,              icon: Ext.MessageBox.ERROR           } ;       },       params: {         'p_flow_id': Ext.getDom 'pFlowId' .value,         'p_flow_step_id': Ext.getDom 'pFlowStepId' .value,         'p_instance': Ext.getDom 'pInstance' .value,         'p_request': 'PLUGIN=' + config.apexPluginId,         'p_widget_action': 'saveConfig',         'f01': f01,         'f02': f02,         'f03': f03,         'x01': panel.getWidth         }     } ;    } }  Ext.apply this, {   tools: tools } ;  [ 301 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  It's not well known that you can pass arrays of data using the f01..f20 parameters,  which are then loaded into PL SQL associative arrays g_f01..gf20  index by tables   in the WWV_FLOW package—an extremely useful fact!  Using the TableGrid Before you can start using the TableGrid, there's one more thing you need to add  specifically a report template for the TableGrid.  As the report template is only being used to pass data to the browser, and isn't  required for presentation at all, the simplest table format we can create is the   best solution.  TableGrid template Report Template Name: EXTJS TableGrid Template Class: Custom 1 Before Rows:     The x-hidden class ensures that the user never sees the table until after it's converted  to a GridPanel.  Before column heading:     Column heading template:   COLUMN_HEADER   After column heading:       Before each row:     Column template 1:   COLUMN_VALUE   [ 302 ]   Chapter 9  After each row:     After rows:       That's it—no row highlighting colors, no pagination required.  Convert Classic Reports to TableGrids To use the TableGrid, first build a Classic Report exactly as you would normally. Then create a region using the TableGrid plug-in, and assign it as the Parent Region  of the Classic Report, as shown in the following screenshot:  The TableGrid uses the TableGrid plug-ins title, ignoring the Classic Report   Region title.   [ 303 ]   Getting Interactive with GridPanels  Do the following tasks to complete the conversion:    	 Set Report Region Template to No Template.  	 Set Report Template to EXTJS TableGrid.  	 Set Report Pagination Scheme to Use Externally Created Pagination Buttons.  	 Add pagination work-around. Create an unconditional page process    to Reset Pagination for the Current Page at the process point   On Load - Before Regions.  All being well, you now have a fully functional GridPanel, giving users stateful  column management features.  [ 304 ]   Chapter 9  Summary In this chapter, we looked at the components making up the GridPanel, the Data  Store, Column Model, Grid View, and Selection Model.  Different approaches were discussed on how you can integrate GridPanels into  APEX, contrasting the "Almost no APEX" approach with the "Relying on APEX"  approach. Here, we came to the realization that APEX already provides a lot of  functionality to you already. It's far more productive if you work to extend what's  already there, rather than creating a whole framework just to support your plug-in.  We then set about creating a TableGrid plug-in using the APEX Classic Reports  as the base for defining the report query and column definitions. By hooking into  existing Classic Reports functionality for querying, pagination, and sorting, we  minimized the amount of work required for the plug-in.   The GridPanel includes column management features, including sorting, resizing,  drag-and-drop column reordering, and show hide columns. We went one step  further, adding functionality to make the GridPanel stateful, allowing user settings  to be saved back into APEX using APEX preferences.  There is much more functionality available to the Ext.grid.GridPanel than we've  covered here, so I would encourage you to explore the Sencha examples further, and  see what functionality would work for your applications.  In the next chapter, we will be looking at adding iFrame functionality via Ext JS into  your applications. It will transform the way your applications work.  [ 305 ]    IFrame Tabs, Panels, and  Popup Windows  iFrames can completely transform the way your APEX applications work, making  them far more functional by allowing you to present multiple HTML pages   documents  to your users within a single window.  Modern web browsers have all implemented tabbed browsing interfaces, allowing  you to open multiple web pages within a browser window. It allows you to read a  web page, opening referenced links in another tab, without losing your place in the  original page. After reading the link you can close the tab, or just switch back to the  original tab.  Switching between pages is very useful for comparison shopping or cross  referencing different information sources. It's also very useful when doing APEX  application development, allowing you to switch from the APEX Builder view to  your application view without having to do multiple page refreshes.  Our application users are very much used to tabbed browsers, so if we don't give  them similar functionality in APEX applications, they will quickly resort to opening  multiple browser tabs. This can create some nasty issues for the users' APEX session  state, with pages relying on APEX session variables that may have been altered in  another browser tab.  Far better to give them similar functionality to open multiple pages in a single  browser tab, where we can control what pages are opened and thus maintain session  state as needed.   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  In this chapter, we will explore using iFrames in three different ways:   	 Embedding other pages within a page using iFrame panels  	 Making popup windows modal  	 Creating a tabbed document interface allowing users to switch between   pages easily without opening multiple browser tabs  Embedding pages using iFrame panels Embedding iFrames into another page is as simple as including an iFrame HTML  markup element in the region source of a page region.  <iframe width="600" height="400" frameborder="0"  src="f?p=&APP_ ID.:200:&APP_SESSION.:">   In this example, we have specified the width, height, and the src attribute of  iFrame using APEX built-in substitution strings for the application ID and session, to  reference page 200 in the current application.  That didn't feel very satisfying to me, how about you? It does show that iFrames are  easy to implement, but let's see if we can add some more functionality.  This time we will embed an iFrame element in a collapsible Ext.Panel, including  extra functionality to make it resizable like the one shown in the following screenshot  and included in chapter10 ex-10-resizable-iframe-panel.html.  Starting off, we create a simple reusable iFrame component.  [ 308 ]   Reusable iFrameComponent Creating a simple iFrame component allows it to be used as an item within more  complex components such as panels, windows, and tab panels. This component  should be included in your application JavaScript.  Chapter 10  Ext.ns 'Ext.apex' ; Ext.apex.IFrameComponent = Ext.extend Ext.BoxComponent, {      **      * The url to be shown in iframe      * @type {String}      *      url : Ext.SSL_SECURE_URL,       **      * @private Just render an iframe      *      onRender : function ct, position {         var url = this.url;         this.el = ct.createChild {tag: 'iframe', id: 'iframe-' + this. id, frameBorder: 0, src: url} ;     } } ; Ext.reg 'iframe', Ext.apex.IFrameComponent ;  The Ext.apex.IFrameComponent created here inherits all the config options   and methods of Ext.BoxComponent in addition to the url option and the   onRender function.   The component accepts a url option and creates an iframe HTML element as a child  of the container element, like as the panel shown earlier in the first figure.   The url option defaults to Ext.SSL_SECURE_URL, which uses about:blank  excepting for IE in secure mode, where it uses javascript:"" to prevent the IE  insecure content warning.  Resizable iFrame panel Looking more closely at the example in chapter10 ex-10-resizable-iframe- panel.html, you can see we have created a standard Ext.Panel, applying it to a DIV  element in the page.        Ext.onReady function  {  [ 309 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows      new Ext.Panel {         allowDomMove: false,         applyTo: 'example-1',         animCollapse: false,         frame: true,         height: 400,         width: 600,         collapsible: true,         titleCollapse: true,         title: 'iFramed Page',         items: [new Ext.apex.IFrameComponent {             id: 'myIFrame',             url: "content-page.html"         } ],         layout: 'fit',         listeners: {             render: function p {                 new Ext.Resizable p.getEl  , {                     handles: 'all',                     pinned: true,                     transparent: true,                     resizeElement: function  {                         var box = this.proxy.getBox  ;                         p.updateBox box ;                         if  p.layout  {                             p.doLayout  ;                         }                         if  Ext.isIE  {                             this.syncHandleHeight  ;                         }                         return box;                     }                 } ;             }         }     } ; } ;    The highlighted code shows that the Ext.apex.IFrameComponent is added  to the panel as an item, in exactly the same way you would add any other Ext  item. The layout: 'fit' config option is important here as it ensures that the  IFrameComponent automatically expands to fill the layout container. The following  diagram shows what happens when the option is commented out:  [ 310 ]   Chapter 10  Also note that the Ext.Resizable element is added when the panel is rendered:          listeners: {             render: function p {                 new Ext.Resizable p.getEl  , {                     handles: 'all',                     pinned: true,                     transparent: true,                     resizeElement: function  {                         var box = this.proxy.getBox  ;                         p.updateBox box ;                         if  p.layout  {                             p.doLayout  ;                         }                         if  Ext.isIE  {                             this.syncHandleHeight  ;                         }                         return box;                     }                 } ;             }         }  [ 311 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  The Ext.Resizable class adds drag handles to the panel to make it resizable, as  shown in the following diagram. In this case, we have used handles: 'all' to add  handles to all sides of the panel; more typically you would use handles: 's e se'  to constrain the top-left corner of the panel to its starting position and still allow the  panel to be sized both horizontally and vertically.               The Ext.Resizable class uses a dashed DIV element as a proxy when sizing using a  click-and-drag motion. Once the user releases the mouse click, the iFrame is resized  to the new dimensions. Resizing iFrames multiple times as the user moves the mouse  is a much more expensive on memory resources than a simple DIV element, so using  a proxy element is a sensible solution.   Pre-configured components using the factory  pattern Several examples shown throughout the book have created new components using  the Ext.extend method to add new functionality or use the Ext.override method  to over-ride existing functionality.  The Ext.apex.Viewport component from Chapter 3 uses the Ext.extend method,  to create a new component, adding functionality to the Ext.Container component:  Ext.apex.Viewport = Ext.extend Ext.Container, {   initComponent : function   {     Ext.apex.Viewport.superclass.initComponent.call this ;         new APEX specific functionality      ** snipped **    },       new method  [ 312 ]    IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  Notice that Ext.apply is used within the function to apply the pre-configured options  first; any instance specific options are applied later. Applying the instance-specific  options after allows the pre-configured options to be changed, as shown here for the  second panel that overrides the pre-configured width with a new value.  IFrame panel factory pattern In the example file named chapter10 ex-10-resizable-iframe-panel-factory. html, the following factory pattern function has been created for the iFrame panel:  Ext.apex.iFramePanel = function config {     return new Ext.Panel Ext.apply {         allowDomMove: false,         animCollapse: false,         collapsible: true,         deferIFrame: config.collapsed  false,         items: [new Ext.apex.IFrameComponent  ],         layout: 'fit',         titleCollapse: true,         url: Ext.SSL_SECURE_URL,         listeners: {             render: function p {                 if  this.handles != 'none'  {                     new Ext.Resizable p.getEl  , {                         handles: config.handles  's e se',                         pinned: true,                         transparent: true,                         resizeElement: function  {                             var box = this.proxy.getBox  ;                             p.updateBox box ;                             if  p.layout  {                                 p.doLayout  ;                             }                             if  Ext.isIE  {                                 this.syncHandleHeight  ;                             }                             return box;                         }                     } ;                 }             },             afterrender: function  {                 this.iframe = this.body.child 'iframe' ;  [ 314 ]   Chapter 10                  if  !this.deferIFrame  {                     this.setSrc this.url ;                 }             },             expand: function  {                 if  this.iframe && !this.iframe.rendered  {                     this.setSrc this.url ;                 }             }         },         setSrc: function url {             if  this.rendered && this.iframe  {                 var mask = new Ext.LoadMask this.body, {                     removeMask: true                 } ;                 new Ext.util.DelayedTask function  {                     mask.show  ;                     new Ext.util.DelayedTask function  {                         mask.hide  ;                     } .delay 250 ;                 } .delay 150 ;                 this.iframe.dom.src = url;                 this.iframe.rendered = true;             }              return this;         }      }, config  ; };  This script would normally be included in your application JavaScript library  external to the page.  Similar to the earlier chapter10 ex-10-resizable-iframe-panel.html example,   it creates a Panel containing an Ext.apex.IFrameComponent. It does so when the  Ext.apex.iFramePanel function is called, allowing multiple Panels to be created.  Towards the bottom of the example file, we instantiate two panels:           Ext.onReady function  {  [ 315 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows      Ext.apex.iFramePanel {         applyTo: 'example-1',         title: 'iFramed Page',         frame: true,         height: 400,         width: 600,         url: "content-page.html"     } ;      Ext.apex.iFramePanel {         applyTo: 'example-2',         height: 400,         width: 600,         collapsed: true,         title: 'Wikipedia',         url: "http:  wikipedia.com",         handles: 'all'     } ;  } ;    The benefits of using a factory pattern function become very apparent; we pass only  those parameters specific to the layout of the individual panels. This reduces the size  of pages and makes the code more readable as well.  An additional piece of functionality was also added to the factory function. The  iFrame is created using the default IFrameComponent configuration, which sets the  url value to Ext.SSL_SECURE_URL—a blank file.          deferIFrame: config.collapsed  false,         items: [new Ext.apex.IFrameComponent  ],  For panels initially rendered in a collapsed state, the iFrame src is not updated until  the panel is expanded. This provides better performance, loading the main page and  loading only iFramed pages when requested by the user.              afterrender: function  {                 this.iframe = this.body.child 'iframe' ;                 if  !this.deferIFrame  {                     this.setSrc this.url ;                 }             },             expand: function  {                 if  this.iframe && !this.iframe.rendered  {                     this.setSrc this.url ;  [ 316 ]   Chapter 10                  }             }         },         setSrc: function url {             if  this.rendered && this.iframe  {                 var mask = new Ext.LoadMask this.body, {                     removeMask: true                 } ;                 new Ext.util.DelayedTask function  {                     mask.show  ;                     new Ext.util.DelayedTask function  {                         mask.hide  ;                     } .delay 250 ;                 } .delay 150 ;                 this.iframe.dom.src = url;                 this.iframe.rendered = true;             }             return this;         }  When the iFrame src is changed, a mask is applied to the panel body using   Ext.util.DelayedTask, as shown in the following diagram. Showing the mask   after a small delay, and then hiding it after another small delay, helps the perception  that the iFramed content loads quickly.  Now we have a good understanding of the resizable iFrame Panel prototype, the last  step is to implement it as an APEX Plug-in.  [ 317 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  IFrame panel plug-in The IFrame plug-in we are creating could also be implemented as a APEX  Region Template. By making it a plug-in, more attributes can be exposed to use  declaratively.   The full source for the database package and JavaScript is included in the Chapter 10  source files, available on the Packt site.  Callbacks: Render function name:   plug_ext_iframepanel.render  Plugin name:  Ext.apex.IFramePanel  Type: Region  Standard attributes: none  Custom attributes:  Type Text  Label URL Width  px  Number Height  px  Number Collapsible Collapsed Frame Resize  Handles  Select List Select List Select List Select List  Required Depending on Values Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes  Collapsible  Default  true false true s e se  true, false true, false true, false south: s east: e south and east: s e se all: all none: none  [ 318 ]   The attributes used for the iFrame panel Plug-in are very straightforward; the URL  attribute defines the source page for the iFrame, whereas the width and height  attributes define the panel size. The URL attribute can accept absolute and relative  URLs and will also convert APEX substitution tags. The following examples are   both valid:  Chapter 10     absolute URL http:  apex.oracle.com     relative URL containing APEX substitution strings f?p=&APP_ID.:60:&APP_SESSION.::NO::P60_ID:&P160_REF_ID.:  The Collapsible attribute determines if the panel is expandable and whether or not  the collapsible behavior is enabled, whereas Collapsed determines if the panel starts  in a collapsed or expanded state. When the Frame attribute is set to true, the panel is  rendered with rounded corners, otherwise it is rendered as a plain panel. The Resize  Handles attribute determines which sides of the panel have grab bars for resizing.  This screenshot shows a typical use of the iFrame panel plug-in with a relative URL  referencing another APEX page and containing APEX substitution strings. Notice  in the User Interface section that the Template field has been set to No Template  because the plug-In will create a panel automatically.  [ 319 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  Plug-in package The package specification for the IFrame panel is a simple Region Plug-in  declaration, with only a render function required.  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE plug_ext_iframepanel AS     function render         p_region              in apex_plugin.t_region      ,p_plugin              in apex_plugin.t_plugin      ,p_is_printer_friendly in boolean            return apex_plugin.t_region_render_result;  END plug_ext_iframepanel;    The full package body and specification are included in the Chapter 10 source files  available on the Packt site as part of the code bundle.  Render functionality for the iFrame panel  plug-in The iFrame panel render function generates JavaScript calling the Ext.apex. iFramePanel function to instantiate a pre-configured Ext Panel with an embedded  iFrame element.  The output will look like the following JavaScript:  Ext.onReady function  {     Ext.apex.iFramePanel {         applyTo: "R3699425022908871",         collapsed: true,         collapsible: true,         frame: false,         handles: "s e se",         height: 400,         title: "IFramed Panel",         url: "f?p=103:60:2236942287935549::NO::P60_ID:110:",         width: 600     } ; } ;  In this code snippet, the url attribute is using the standard APEX f?p syntax:   f?p=App:Page:Session:Request:Debug:ClearCache:itemNames:itemValues:  PrinterFriendly  [ 320 ]   The original URL shown in the previous screenshot—f?p=&APP_ID.:60:&APP_ SESSION.::NO:P60_ID:&P_160_REF_ID—has been converted with APEX  substitution tags replaced to give the final URL.  Chapter 10  The PL SQL code for the render function is:  FUNCTION render      p_region              in apex_plugin.t_region   ,p_plugin              in apex_plugin.t_plugin   ,p_is_printer_friendly in boolean      return apex_plugin.t_region_render_result is     type t_type is table of pls_integer index by varchar2 255 ;    l_default_col_idx t_type;     l_result        apex_plugin.t_region_render_result;    l_script        varchar2 32767 ;  BEGIN    -- debug info    if wwv_flow.g_debug then       wwv_flow_plugin_util.debug_region            p_plugin              => p_plugin         ,p_region              => p_region         ,p_is_printer_friendly => p_is_printer_friendly        ;    end if;     -- print div as target    htp.p '<div id="R'p_region.id          '" class="ux-iframe"> ' ;     -- Assemble config properties    push 'url'         ,'"'p_region.attribute_01'"' ;    push 'width'       ,p_region.attribute_02 ;    push 'height'      ,p_region.attribute_03 ;    push 'collapsible' ,p_region.attribute_04 ;    push 'collapsed'   ,p_region.attribute_05 ;    push 'frame'       ,p_region.attribute_06 ;    push 'handles'     ,'"'p_region.attribute_07'"' ;     push 'applyTo'     ,'"'p_region.static_id'"' ;    push 'title'       ,'"'escape_json p_region.name '"' ;  [ 321 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows     l_script := CRLF       'Ext.onReady function  {'CRLF       '    Ext.apex.iFramePanel {'CRLF                get_properties 8        '    } ;'CRLF       '} ;'CRLF;     -- add JS to bottom of page    wwv_flow_javascript.add_onload_code  p_code => l_script ;     return l_result; END;  Once again, we have reused custom convenience routines from previous Plug-ins;  push, escape_json and get_properties, so no need to discuss those here.   The PL SQL used here is quite trivial, simply rendering a DIV element and then  generating the JavaScript using the parameter values for the Region Plug-in.   We don't even have to implement search and replace functionality to convert the  APEX substitution strings into session state values—APEX does that automatically  for us.  That wraps up this section on iFramed panels; let's now turn our attention to Modal  Popup Windows.  Modal popup windows Creating popup windows is a straightforward process of opening another browser  window using the JavaScript window.open   command. APEX does this for Popup  LOV items, the legacy datepicker, and within Application Builder for online help, to  name a few examples.  The challenging issue with popup windows is you can't make them modal in any  standard way across the major browsers. The second issue with popup windows is  that you cannot completely hide the browser "chrome", or border components of a  web browser window, which includes window frames, menus, toolbars, and   scroll bars.  [ 322 ]   Chapter 10  The modal Ext.Window with an embedded iFrame page, shown in the previous  screenshot, neatly solves both of these issues and gives a more polished-looking  solution at the same time.  In this example, clicking on the edit link for the Interactive Report launches the  modal popup window to edit the user details. Once the details are updated, clicking  the Apply Changes button submits the page for processing; a successful result closes  the popup and re-queries the Interactive Report to display the updated details.   An unsuccessful result keeps the popup open with the usual error messages  displayed; the Cancel button simply closes the popup window. Let's see how the  solution is put together.  Modal iFramed window Starting with the example in chapter10 ex-10-modal-iframed-window.html, you  can see just how easy it is to add the iFrame functionality to a standard Ext.Window.        [ 323 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  Ext.onReady function  {     var win;      Ext.get 'show-btn' .on 'click', function  {            create the window on the first click            reuse on subsequent clicks         if !win {             win = new Ext.Window {                 title:'Modal Window',                 width: 600,                 height: 400,                 items: [ new Ext.apex.IFrameComponent { url: "content- page.html" }  ],                  closeAction:'hide',                 layout: 'fit',                 modal: true,                 plain: true,                 resizable: true             } ;         }         win.show this ;     } ;  } ;    Here, an Ext click event listener has been added to an HTML button, creating an Ext. Window if it doesn't already exist. The Ext.Window includes our custom Ext.apex. IFrameComponent as an item, with a URL specifying the HTML page to open.  Making the window modal is done using the modal: true config setting. It really  is that simple to solve the first of our challenging issues; using an embedded iframe  markup element takes care of the lesser browser chrome issue.  Notice the closeAction config option is set to hide, in order to hide the Window  when closed, rather than the default 'close' setting which destroys the Window,  removing it from the DOM. Our eventual solution will use the default close setting,  but it's important to understand the significance of this setting.  [ 324 ]   Chapter 10  This diagram shows the chapter10 ex-10-modal-iframed-window.html example.  Try opening the example and experimenting with it; you will find this very simple  example can be dragged around the page, resized, and repeatedly opened and  closed. Amazing functionality for so little effort on our part.  Popup window component The final solution for the modal popup window extends Ext.Window to create  a custom component named Ext.apex.PopupWindow that contains custom  configurations as well as an additional event and function. It should be added to  your JavaScript application library.  Ext.apex.PopupWindow = Ext.extend Ext.Window, {     url: Ext.SSL_SECURE_URL,     title: document.title,     width: 700,     height: 600,     initComponent: function  {                 starting config, can't be modified externally         var config = {             border: false,             closable: true,             closeAction: 'close',             header: true,             items: [new Ext.apex.IFrameComponent {                 url: this.url             } ],  [ 325 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows              layout: 'fit',             maximizable: true,             modal: true,             plain: true         };                     apply config         Ext.apply this, Ext.apply this.initialConfig, config  ;                  Ext.apex.PopupWindow.superclass.initComponent.call this ;                  this.addEvents           **          * @event success          * Fires when iframed page has been processed          * successfully.          * @param {Ext.apex.PopupWindow} this          *          'success' ;              },     processSuccessful: function  {         this.fireEvent "success", this ;         this[this.closeAction]  ;     } } ;  Here, the initComponent function of Ext.Window has been overridden to include a  config object literal with a set of property values that can't be modified from outside  the component when instantiating a new Window.  Using Ext.apply to apply this configuration, first to the window's initialConfig  and then to the new window instance, ensures that these properties override any  similarly passed properties. Standard Ext.Window initComponent functionality is  then called using:  Ext.apex.PopupWindow.superclass.initComponent.call this ;  A custom success event is added, allowing the code that instantiated the Ext.apex. PopupWindow to include callback functionality to listen for this event. We will see  exactly how this works shortly.  [ 326 ]   In conjunction with the success event, a custom processSuccessful function   is defined:  Chapter 10      processSuccessful: function  {         this.fireEvent "success", this ;         this[this.closeAction]  ;     }  The processSuccessful function fires the success event, and then closes the  window using the method specified by the closeAction attribute. It is designed   to be called from an iFramed page to indicate data has been updated before closing  the window.  This is quite dry reading, so let's put together a working example to bring it to life!  Ext.apex.PopupWindow example To demonstrate the Ext.apex.PopupWindow component, I'm using the APEX Wizard  to create new pages using the Form on a Table with Report option, shown in the  following screenshot:  Stepping through the wizard, I selected a table named APP_USERS as the data source,  creating a Report page titled Application Users, using an Interactive Report, and a  second DML Form page Edit Application Users.  [ 327 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  After completing the wizard, the end result is an Interactive Report page shown in  the following screenshot, with an edit icon for each row, which opens the DML Form  page in the current window, retrieving the details for the selected record. It also  includes a Create button that opens the same DML Form page to insert new records.  I'm sure this is all very familiar to you, so I won't elaborate on this standard process  any further. Let's start converting the solution to use the PopupWindow config,  starting with the Link Column settings for the Edit icon.  Link Column settings In the APEX Application Builder, open the Interactive Report page and then navigate  to the Interactive Report Attributes  Link Column section. Your settings should  look very similar to those shown in the following screenshot, except the Link  Attribute value.  [ 328 ]   Chapter 10  The full text for the Link Attributes field is:  onclick="new top.Ext.apex.PopupWindow  {      url: this.href,      title: 'Edit User Details',      width: 490,      height: 500,      listeners: {'success': gReport.search}  }  .show  ;  return false;"  Here, we are launching Ext.apex.PopupWindow by adding an onclick attribute to  the HTML link element generated by APEX. To prevent the default behavior of the  link, we use the return false; statement at the end of the script.  The PopupWindow config uses url: this.href to pick the href attribute value,  allowing developers to build the link details using the APEX Builder functionality   as usual.  Notice that we are using the top keyword when instantiating PopupWindow,  ensuring that the window is opened from the topmost page window in case the  current window is in an iFrame. This is not necessary for this example as presented  here, but becomes necessary when Interactive Reports are embedded in iFrames,   just like we will be doing in the tabbed document interface section coming up in   this chapter.  onclick="new top.Ext.apex.PopupWindow  {       * snipped *       listeners: {'success': gReport.search}  }  .show  ;  return false;"  The Ext.apex.PopupWindow component includes a custom success event, which is  executed when the processSuccessful function is used to close the PopupWindow  config. Closing the PopupWindow using the standard Ext.Window close function  does not fire the success event.  By adding a listener for the success event, we can automatically re-query the  Interactive Report when PopupWindow is closed, using the processSuccessful  function:      listeners: {'success': gReport.search}   Using the success event eliminates unnecessary refresh requests for the Interactive  Report by only refreshing when the PopupWindow config indicates that changes  have been made.  [ 329 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows Classic Report link settings  If you were to use a Classic Report instead of an Interactive Report, replace the  gReport.search function with the equivalent $a_report function to refresh a  Classic Report:  onclick="new top.Ext.apex.PopupWindow  {      url: this.href,      title: 'Edit User Details',      width: 490,      height: 500,      listeners: {'success':                        $a_report '3833408439418014',0,0,0,0,'current'                 }      }  .show  ;  return false;"  The $a_report function requires the report ID of the report as the first parameter,  and the string current as the sixth parameter, specifying the report is to be refreshed  with current pagination settings. The other parameters are not used by the function  when refreshing but need to be specified, so zero values can be used.  Create Button settings The Create Button functionality to launch PopupWindow is similar to the Link  Column settings, only slightly less elegant.  The lack of elegance comes about because we are unable to use APEX "Action When  Button Clicked" functionality. Instead, the URL must be specified in the Button  Attributes section, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 330 ]               It is also necessary to create a custom button template ExtJS Button, Attributes  Only by copying the ExtJS Button template and removing the onclick="LINK"  reference:  The finished markup for the ExtJS Button, Attributes Only template is:  Chapter 10  <table cellspacing="0" class="ux-btn ux-btn-markup x-btn x-btn-noicon"  style="width:auto;" BUTTON_ATTRIBUTES>         &nbsp;            &nbsp;           &nbsp;                    LABEL                &nbsp;           &nbsp;            &nbsp;          This is quite a useful button template, because it allows us to specify the onclick  functionality to suit any individual situation.   The code for the Button Attributes in the previous screenshot is:  onclick="new top.Ext.apex.PopupWindow  {      url:'f?p=&APP_ID.:155:&APP_SESSION.::NO:155::',      title: 'Create New User',      listeners: {'success': gReport.search}  }  .show  ;  return false;"  Notice that here the URL has to be specified, but can use APEX substitution strings  and session state values. The width and height attributes weren't included here,  using the default values specified in our custom component.  [ 331 ]    Chapter 10  This screenshot shows the target DML Form embedded in the modal popup  window. The default processing created by the APEX wizard simply redirects the  browser to the calling page when the Cancel button is clicked. When the Apply  Changes button is clicked, the form is submitted for processing—either successfully  completing and branching to the calling page, or redisplaying the current page with  error messages. So we need to deal with two different behaviors, modifying the Cancel button to  simply close the PopupWindow, and for the Apply Changes button to process the  page and close the PopupWindow.   Cancel Button functionality The Cancel Button functionality is very straightforward, using our EXTJS   Button, Attributes Only button to include a simple onclick attribute with   the relevant JavaScript.  This screenshot shows the JavaScript in its entirety:  onclick="parent.Ext.WindowMgr.getActive  .close  "  Here, we are utilizing the Ext.WindowMgr singleton that centralizes management  of all Ext.Window components on a page. Taking advantage of this fact, we  implemented the PopupWindow as a modal window; it's inferred that it must be the  active window, and as the target page is iFramed, the window must belong to the  iframe parent.   Putting all these pieces together, we have a simple one-line solution to close   the window.  [ 333 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows Apply Changes functionality The Apply Changes functionality is a little trickier. We have to submit the page, and  when it successfully completes the page processing, it branches to the target page  and closes the PopupWindow. Fortunately, APEX 4.0 provides similar functionality  to what we need, giving the vital clues to the end solution.  APEX 4.0 provides the Close popup window page process shown in the previous  screenshot, which almost does what we want, so let's explore how that works first. The Close popup window page process works by creating a page process, which  upon execution, closes the current popup window. The next screenshot shows the  execution order of processing a page. Here we can see the Close Window process  executing after the row processing for the APP_USERS table, after records have been  insert, updated, or deleted.  [ 334 ]   Chapter 10  The Close Window process completes before the After Processing section where  page branching occurs. It does this by rendering a very small HTML page and then  terminating any further processing by the APEX engine.  The page it creates looks like:     if  self != window.opener  window.close  ;     How lightweight is that! An HTML page containing a one-line instruction to close  the current window. Using this process for our solution would close the iFrame  successfully, but leaves a blank Ext.Window remaining.   The solution for an Ext.apex.PopupWindow is to mimic the built-in process,  modifying the JavaScript to suit our needs. First off, create an Application Process: Process point:   On Demand: Run this application process when requested by a page  process.  Name:   Process text:  Succeed and Close Ext.apex.PopupWindow  -- Force APEX to not show any HTML wwv_flow.g_page_text_generated := true; wwv_flow.g_unrecoverable_error := true;  htp.init; htp.prn '   parent.Ext.WindowMgr.getActive  . processSuccessful  ;   ' ;  This only needs to be done once, and is available for all APEX pages to use. The  magic is in the two highlighted lines, which tell the APEX engine that the page text  has been generated and to do no further page processing.  Our script is similar to the Cancel button functionality, except that we call the   custom processSuccessful function instead to trigger the success event before  closing the window.  [ 335 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  Then simply add a page process to the target page, calling the "on-demand"  application process at the process point "On Submit - After Computations and  Validations", ensuring that it occurs after the other page processes, as shown in the  following screenshot:  This completes the functionality for the Ext.apex.PopupWindow component.   [ 336 ]   You now can open pages in popup windows like the previous screenshot, listening  for a success event. Changes made by the popup window page can trigger the  success event when the window is closed, providing the option of including  JavaScript code to update the original page.  Chapter 10  Creating a tabbed document interface To discourage users from opening multiple browser tabs, where we have no control  over which pages are opened, we can give them similar functionality to open  multiple pages in a single browser tab.  This allows developers to design the APEX application so that we are in control  of what pages can be opened, and also design the pages so they are less reliant on  maintaining session state.  This screenshot shows the example file named chapter10  ex-10-tree-iframe- tabs.html that we will examine in this section.  Unlike the earlier examples shown in this chapter, we won't be going through how to  incorporate this into your APEX application in detail. Instead, we will only examine  the functionality of the prototype to understand the JavaScript behavior.  [ 337 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  Examining the HTML page The structure for the page layout for the example page is quite simple.           TITLE      <link rel="icon" type="image x-icon"           href="IMAGE_PREFIXfavicon.ico">     <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image x-icon"           href="IMAGE_PREFIXfavicon.ico">            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"            href=".. .. extjs resources css ext-all.css">     <script type="text javascript"          src=".. .. extjs adapter ext ext-base.js">      <script type="text javascript"          src=".. .. extjs ext-all.js">       <!-- Static json tree data. In APEX would use list or          table to dynamically generate in the page -->     <script type="text javascript"          src="navigation-tree-data.js">             <script type="text javascript"          src="TabCloseMenu.js">      <script type="text javascript"          src="ex-10-tree-iframe-tabs.js">            Header Contents                                          [ 338 ]   Chapter 10  The header section contains the usual references to the Ext CSS and JavaScript files  and also our application-specific CSS and JavaScript files. The body comprises a DIV  element named app-north-panel that contains all the HTML markup for the north  panel of an Ext.Viewport layout.  The remaining markup of interest is the FORM wwvFlowForm element created   by APEX using the FORM_OPEN and FORM_CLOSE substitution tags. For our   Ext.Viewport layout, the wwvFlowForm element is used for the center panel, and  contains all page content.  The JavaScript file named navigation-tree-data.js contains a static array to  define the tree data for this example:  var jsonTreeData = [     {id  :"L3529107364353923",      text:"Application",      href:"",      leaf:false,       children: [{          id  :"L3529403918353923",          text:"Page 0",          href:"content-page.html",          leaf:true      }, {          id  :"L3529722176353923",          text:"Attachments",          href:"content-page.html",          leaf:true      }]     }, {             ** snipped many more tree nodes *           } ];  Usually in APEX, the tree data would be generated dynamically, either using a  custom table-based solution or as we did in Chapter 4, Ext Themed Regions, Labels, and  Lists, using an APEX list combined with a List template that generated a JSON tree  definition. In fact, the example here with minor edits uses the data that has been cut  and pasted directly from a page using the APEX list solution.  [ 339 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  The TabCloseMenu.js JavaScript file contains an Ext custom plug-in copied from the  extjs examples ux  directory. When the plug-in is included in a TabPanel region,  it adds a right-click context menu to close tabs, as shown in the following screenshot:  We will see how the TabCloseMenu plug-in is included in the ex-10-tree-iframe- tabs.js JavaScript file, which is the only component that remains to be examined.  Examining the JavaScript The Ext.apex.IFrameComponent component has been declared in this standalone  example, but is not shown here. As usual for any code being executed in the page,  we enclose it within an Ext.onReady statement with an anonymous function,  ensuring any variables declared are localized to the function and ensuring that the  code is executed when the document is ready.  Ext.onReady function  {    Ext.QuickTips.init  ;      var contentPanel = {     id: 'content-panel',     region: 'center',     xtype: 'tabpanel',     margins: '2 5 5 0',     enableTabScroll: true,     activeItem: 0,     plugins: new Ext.ux.TabCloseMenu  ,     border: true,     defaultType: 'iframe',     defaults: {       closable: true     },     items: [{       xtype: 'panel',  [ 340 ]   Chapter 10        closable: false,       title: 'Normal Tab',       contentEl: 'wwvFlowForm'     }]   };  The contentPanel object literal is defined with the region: 'center' attribute,  ensuring that the panel is rendered into a region within the Viewport container  further on in the code. At this point, only the configuration for the panel has been  defined, and the panel hasn't been created yet.  Notice the contentPanel is specified as xtype: 'tabpanel' using lazy  instantiation. The xtype will be looked up at render time to determine what type   of child Component to create. By defining it as a TabPanel, it acts like a standard   Ext.Panel for layout purposes, but allows additional panels to be added at a later  time as separate tabs. The Ext.usTabCloseMenu component has been added as a  plugin to the TabPanel. The TabPanel includes an Ext.Panel declared as xtype: 'panel' using lazy  instantiation and uses the existing HTML wwvFlowForm element as the content of  the panel component. Ext may re-arrange the DOM components when rendering the  page, but this ensures that the APEX form and its child components will be in the  center region of the Viewport.        Create the TreePanel now so that we can use it below   var treePanel = new Ext.tree.TreePanel {     id: 'tree-panel',     region: 'center',     minSize: 150,     autoScroll: true,     border: false,             tree-specific configs:     rootVisible: false,     lines: false,     singleExpand: true,     useArrows: true,          loader: new Ext.tree.TreeLoader {       clearOnLoad: false,       preloadChildren: true,       pathSeparator: '>'     } ,          root: new Ext.tree.AsyncTreeNode {  [ 341 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows        leaf: false,       expanded: true,       text: 'Tree Root',       draggable: false,       children: jsonTreeData     }    } ;  An Ext.tree.TreePanel component is created, specifying that it is to be rendered  into the center region of its container. Unlike the earlier contentPanel, the tree  component exists as a DOM object, but hasn't been rendered yet. The root node uses  the JavaScript array of tree nodes defined in the navigation-tree-data.js file as  its child nodes.        only make leaf nodes selectable   treePanel.getSelectionModel  .on 'beforeselect', function sm, node {     return node.isLeaf  ;   } ;  A beforeselect event is added to the TreePanel selection model to cancel any  selection events for branch nodes, typically represented as folders. This is done as an  application design choice, to use folders to classify related pages that are represented  by the leaf nodes.  We can only add the event to the TreePanel here because it exists as a DOM object.       Create layout actions for tree node click.   treePanel.on 'click', function node, e {     e.stopEvent  ;     if  !node.isLeaf           return false;          var tab, tabs = Ext.getCmp 'content-panel' ;          if  tabs &&  tab = tabs.getComponent 'tab-' + node.id    {       tabs.setActiveTab tab ;     }     else {       tab = tabs.add {         title: node.text,         id: 'tab-' + node.id,         url: node.attributes.href,         closable: true       } ;       tab.show  ;     }   } ;  [ 342 ]   Chapter 10  A click event listener is added to the TreePanel, defining the actions to be performed  when a leaf node is selected. A stopEvent   utility is used to stop the event from  propagating up the DOM hierarchy and also prevent the event default action from  occurring. This is very important to include, because Ext renders tree nodes as HTML  links, with the default action opening the link in the current window.  The TabPanel we declared earlier is identified using Ext.getCmp 'content- panel' , because it hasn't been created at this point. Using the tree node.id, a check  is done to see if a matching tab exists with the same ID prefixed by 'tab-'. When  a match is found, the tab is set as the active tab; otherwise, a new tab containing an  iframe is added to the tab panel opening the node's URL in the iFrame.        Finally, build the main layout   new Ext.Viewport {     layout: 'border',     items: [{       applyTo: 'app-north-panel',       autoHeight: true,       autoScroll: false,       region: 'north',       style: {         padding: '0 5px'       },       xtype: 'box'     }, {       layout: 'border',       id: 'navigationPanel',       title: 'Navigation',       region: 'west',       border: true,       split: true,       margins: '2 0 5 5',       width: 275,       minSize: 100,       maxSize: 500,       animCollapse: false,       animate: false,       collapsible: true,       collapseMode: 'mini',       items: [treePanel]     }, contentPanel]   } ;  [ 343 ]   IFrame Tabs, Panels, and Popup Windows  An Ext.Viewport component is instantiated with north, west, and center regions. The  north region picks up the HTML markup contained in the app-north-panel DIV  element. The center region uses the contentPanel containing the APEX form and the  west region is a container for a nested sub-region using the treePanel.    Ext.getCmp 'content-panel' .on 'tabchange', function tp, tab {       treePanel.getSelectionModel  .clearSelections  ;            var node = treePanel.getNodeById tab.id.substring 4  ;       if  node  {         node.ensureVisible  ;         node.select  ;       }   } ;      } ;  Finally, functionality is added to the TabPanel component ensuring the correct tree  node is selected and highlighted when a user clicks on a different tab.   That covers the functionality of the tabbed document interface, but why haven't we  covered getting it into APEX?  Adding the tabbed document interface to  APEX There are a number of tasks to perform to incorporate the tabbed document interface  into your APEX theme, and it requires some thought and planning on your part.  First, you will need to create a new page template for the main page and include  the JavaScript functionality in an external file. You will also need to review the page  template for the pages opened up in the tabs.  But that's really the least of your challenges. The most important task to think about  is your application navigation. What pages do you want to open in the tabs? How do  you navigate to other pages from a tabbed page?  A possible option could be to open interactive reports in the tabbed pages, and from  there, open any child pages as popup windows.   Or alternatively, you could open summary pages in a tab, which then drill   down to detail pages within the tab. You would need to ensure that you have  appropriate options to navigate backwards and forwards between the pages   for this to be functional.  [ 344 ]   Chapter 10  Also under consideration is session state. When is it safe to reset session state for a  page? Can you still clear session state for all pages in your application, or is that too  dangerous now?  The potential benefits of tabbed document interfaces are huge from an end user  perspective, and can make your applications far more functional and productive.  There is, however, a bit to think about—either before you retro-fit tabbed document  interfaces to your existing application, or in upfront design considerations for   new applications.  Summary In this chapter we have looked at using iFrames in three different ways:   	 Embedding other pages within a page using iFramed Panels  	 Making popup windows modal  	 Creating a tabbed document interface allowing users to switch backwards  and forwards easily between pages without opening multiple browser tabs  IFrames open up a host of new opportunities to add improved functionality to your  applications. You need to be more mindful of APEX session state, but the benefits are  most definitely there.  In the next chapter, we will be looking performance tuning your JavaScript,   reducing the size of the files and eliminating unused Ext components from the  standard Ext library.  [ 345 ]    Performance Tuning   Your JavaScript  Despite increasing speeds in broadband connections, it's still important as ever to  keep web pages as lightweight as possible. High-speed Internet connections aren't  available everywhere. For example, I work for a large infrastructure and mining  organization, which has a number of sites in remote and inhospitable areas, with  communications often dependent on low bandwidth, high-latency satellite links.  The trend towards applications aimed at mobile devices, such as Smartphone and  other handheld devices with expensive data charges and relatively slow download  rates also encourages us to keep web pages lightweight.  Throughout this book, we have been using the full Ext JS library in our APEX page  templates, either using the compressed ext-all.js file or the larger uncompressed  ext-all-debug.js version. A series of custom JavaScript components and  application functionality have also been developed along the way, which I keep  telling you to add to your application JavaScript file also. All this adds up to lots of  JavaScript on top of the files already included by the APEX engine!  In this chapter, we will be looking at ways of keeping our JavaScript lightweight by:   	 Enabling HTTP compression  	 Using JSBuilder2 to combine and minify JavaScript and CSS files  	 Eliminating unused Ext components from the standard Ext JS library  	 Combining and minifying application JavaScript    It's very easy to check whether your web server currently has HTTP compression  enabled or not by checking the Response Headers under the Net tab in Firebug,  looking for Content-Encoding gzip, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 11  Browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer have similar  developer tools built into the browser that you can use to inspect Response Headers.  A study of 9,281 HTML pages of popular sites by Destounis et al in 2001 found a  mean compression gain of 75.2%. This translates into faster download times and a  better user experience. You may be surprised that I'm referencing such an old study;  it does reinforce the point that HTTP compression has been around for a long time.  The following screenshot shows compression data for an APEX page using the Ext JS  page template:  [ 349 ]   Performance Tuning Your JavaScript  The Firebug YSlow add-on by Yahoo shows the reduced size of page components  when gzip compression is enabled. You can see the Ext library ext-all.js has a  gzipped size of 238.4K compared with 715.4K, or roughly a 70% reduction in size. If your web server doesn't currently have HTTP compression enabled, I strongly  encourage you to enable it as it can result in a dramatic reduction in download time.  There are many references on the Internet on how to enable it.  Externalize JavaScript and CSS External files generally produce faster pages because the JavaScript and CSS files are  cached by the browser. JavaScript and CSS content that is included in-lined in HTML  pages get downloaded every time the page is requested.  The following screenshot shows graphs from the YSlow utility showing the benefits  of browser caching when the JavaScript and CSS are in external files.  The size of the HTML document is reduced dramatically. In this example, the page  size is reduced by roughly 400K, or 90%, because the JavaScript and CSS are in  external files.  APEX applications that are used frequently by their users benefit the most from  browser caching, because the likelihood of the files remaining in the browsers cache  is much higher.  [ 350 ]   Chapter 11  Combining JavaScript and CSS files Combining external scripts into as few files as possible cuts down the number of  HTTP request response round-trips and delays downloading of other resources.  It also ensures that JavaScript files with dependencies in other files are loaded and  executed in the correct sequence.  The ext-all.js library combines 26 separate JavaScript files, which can be  referenced instead of the ext-all.js file. The following screenshot shows the  download profile of an HTML file containing just the ext-base.js file and the 26  files making up the ext-all.js file using the Firebug Net panel:  [ 351 ]   Performance Tuning Your JavaScript  Notice that only four files are being downloaded from the host at any given time.  Many browsers block the downloading of resources referenced in the document  after scripts until those scripts are downloaded and executed. Older browsers, such as  IE 6 and IE 7, allow only two concurrent connections to a host, slowing down the  download process even further.  Compare the difference shown in the following screenshot, which shows the files  combined into the ext-all.js library:  The download time is still substantially less despite this example being run on a  local web server. Running the same example on a remote server would increase the  round-trip times, making the difference even larger.  Currently, APEX 4.0 typically includes five separate JavaScript files in the page  header before you start including your JavaScript files. This will be addressed in  APEX 4.1, with the files being combined into a single file.  Google recommend a maximum of three, or preferably two, JavaScript files. CSS files  should be combined as well, with Google recommending a maximum of three, but  preferably two CSS files for a page.  Minifying JavaScript and CSS files Minification is the practice of removing unnecessary characters from code to reduce  its size and thus improving loading times. When the code is minified, all comments  are removed, along with unneeded white space characters. For example, Sencha  provides the minified ext-all.js at 715.4K, which is roughly half the unminified  ext-all-debug.js version at 1367.8K.  The smaller file size reduces network latency, and allows the JavaScript to be loaded  and executed more quickly by the browser.  There are a number of minification tools freely available on the Internet, including  Yahoos' YUI Compressor, which is used by the Sencha JSBuilder2 tool we will be  using in this chapter to combine and minify JavaScript and CSS files.  [ 352 ]    Performance Tuning Your JavaScript  The following screenshot shows the layout of my SVN repository, which I'll be  referencing in upcoming examples:  As you can see that within the trunk folder of the apex-solutions playpen project,  I've created a series of folders to partition my application logically. The bin folder  holds my batch scripts, including the JSBuilder2.jar and buildPlaypen.bat script  detailed shortly. Also note the src folder, which contains apex and APP folders containing JavaScript  files, a resources folder containing CSS and custom image assets, and the playpen- book.jsb2 configuration file used by JSBuilder2 to package the files.  [ 354 ]   Chapter 11  JSBuilder2 usage JSBuilder2 is a command-line utility, and accepts the following arguments: --projectFile -p  --homeDir -d  --verbose -v    REQUIRED  Location of a JSB2 project file   REQUIRED  Home directory to which to build the project    OPTIONAL  Output detailed information about what is  being built  --debugSuffix -s     OPTIONAL  Suffix to append to JS debug targets, defaults to  'debug'  --help -h  Each of the arguments has a long form and a short form, making the following  Windows examples equivalent:   OPTIONAL  Prints this help display  java -jar JSBuilder2.jar --projectFile C:\Apps\src\ext.jsb2 --homeDir  C:\Apps\deploy\  is the same as:  java -jar JSBuilder2.jar -p C:\Apps\src\ext.jsb2 -d C:\Apps\deploy\  As JSBuilder2 is a Java utility, it can also be run under Unix Linux and OS X also:  java -jar JSBuilder2.jar --projectFile  home aaron www trunk ext.jsb2  --homeDir  home aaron www deploy   For convenience, include the JSBuilder2 command in a batch or shell script for  your project, as I've done in the preceding screenshot, where the batch script  buildPlaypen.bat loads the playpen-book.jsb2 file to assemble my JavaScript files  and resources for deployment into the web folder. The source for the batch file is:  REM Navigate to the scripts location to execute set HOME=%CD% cd  d %~dp0  java -jar JSBuilder2.jar -p ..\src\playpen-book.jsb2 -d ..\web\ux\ -v  @echo off setlocal  goto exit  :exit cd  d %HOME% endlocal  [ 355 ]   Performance Tuning Your JavaScript  Relative paths have been passed to the JSBuilder2 utility in this example.  The only argument passed to the JSBuilder2 utility that needs explanation is the  format of the projectFile, so let's turn our attention to that now.  JSB2 file format The JSB2 file format is a JSON encoded configuration file developed by Sencha for  managing JS & CSS project builds. Details for the file format can be found in the  JSB2FileFormat.txt file included in the ZIP file with the JSBuilder2 utility.  The best way to understand the file format is to examine the ext.jsb2 file used to  compile the Ext JS library, and included in the top directory of the ZIP file when you  download the Ext JS library.  Removing most of the ext.jsb2 file contents, the structure of the looks like   the following:  {     "projectName": "Ext JS",     "deployDir": "ext-3.3+",     "licenseText": "Ext JS Library 3.3.1\nCopyright c  2006-2010  Sencha Inc.\n licensing@sencha.com\nhttp:  www.sencha.com license",     "pkgs": [{           ** snipped **      }],     "resources": [{         "src": "src ",         "dest": "src ",         "filters": ".*\\.js"     },{         "src": "examples ",         "dest": "examples ",         "filters": ".*[\\.html\\.jpg\\.png\\.gif\\.css\\.js\\. php]"     },{           ** snipped **      },{         "src": "resources ",         "dest": "resources ",         "filters": ".*"     },{           ** snipped **      },{  [ 356 ]   Chapter 11          "src": "ext.jsb2",         "dest": "ext.jsb2",         "filters": ".*"     }] }  All the top-level, keys are shown here; the projectName is a simple string describing  the project.  The deployDir is a string specifying the directory to create within the homeDir  specified on the command line. So, using the command:  java -jar JSBuilder2.jar --projectFile C:\Apps\src\ext.jsb2 --homeDir  C:\Apps\deploy\  to compile the Ext library, would result in the Ext library being created into C:\ Apps\deploy\ext-3.3+\, picking up the value of the deployDir attribute.  The licenseText attribute is a string, which is added to the header of all JavaScript  and CSS files created by JSBuilder2. Note the use of \n to add newlines in the output.  The pkgs attribute is an array of package descriptors, which we will go into in more  detail shortly.  The resources attribute is used to copy files from a location to a folder within the  deployment directory. It uses an array of resource descriptors to specify which files  are copied. The src and dest descriptors specify the source and destination folders,  and regular expression filters are used to specify which files are included.  Asterisks can be used as wildcards, and backslashes  \  must be escaped using a  double backslash  \\  as shown:  {"src": "src ", "dest": "src ", "filters": ".*\\.js"}  Multiple filters for a single source directory can be specified by separating filter  expressions with the pipe    symbol:  {   "src": "examples ",   "dest": "examples ",   "filters": ".*[\\.html\\.jpg\\.png\\.gif\\.css\\.js]" }  Use ".*" to include all files in a source directory, and any child directories use:  {"src": "resources ","dest": "resources ", "filters": ".*"}  [ 357 ]   Performance Tuning Your JavaScript  The JSBuilder2 utility automatically excludes .svn and hidden files, originally a  feature for the Sencha team for their own internal development, and useful for   us also.  The pkgs attribute is used to define package definitions, which combine JavaScript  files of related functionality into a single package file, outputting an unmodified  debug version, and a minified version. The ext.jsb2 file includes the "Data – XML"  package; a concise example showing all the package descriptors:  {     "name": "Data - XML",     "file": "pkgs data-xml.js",     "isDebug": true,     "pkgDeps": ["pkgs data-foundation.js"],     "includeDeps": false,     "fileIncludes": [         {"text": "XmlWriter.js","path": "src data "},         {"text": "XmlReader.js","path": "src data "},         {"text": "XmlStore.js", "path": "src data "}     ] }  The name simply describes the package; file specifies the name of the output file to  create within the deployment directory and may include directory paths as shown  here. The isDebug descriptor is a true false flag to generate debug builds; however,  it is currently ignored and a debug version is always generated in addition to the  compressed version.  The pkgDeps descriptor is an array of JavaScript files on which this package is  dependent to work correctly. In this example, the includeDeps flag to include  dependent files in the package build is set to the default false value, so the pkgDeps is  simply listing its dependencies. Setting the includeDeps flag to true would add the  source of the dependent files to the beginning of the packages' file.  The fileIncludes descriptor is an array of files, which need to be included in this  package. In this example, three files have been included, passing the directory and  file name using the path and text descriptors.  CSS files can be packaged in exactly the same way as JavaScript files. The JSBuilder2  utility distinguishes the file type using the output filename suffix. Currently,   the utility does not minify CSS files, but simply packages multiple CSS files into a  package file.  [ 358 ]   Chapter 11  Eliminating unused Ext JS library  components Even with compression enabled, the Ext JS library and CSS files are still quite large.  So, we will look at reducing the size of the source files using the JSBuilder2 utility.  Up to this point, the APEX page templates we have developed included the ext- base.js and ext-all.js JavaScript files in addition to the JavaScript files which  are automatically included by APEX. We can reduce the size of the Ext files, by  removing duplicate functionality and unused components.  Early versions of Ext required one of the following base libraries to be included:   	 YUI  	  	 Prototype Script.aculo.us  jQuery or   Ext contains adapters that provide some of the basic plumbing utilities from   those libraries, including Ajax support, animation, DOM manipulation, and   event handling.  Beginning with Version 1.1, Ext included a native Ext adapter ext-base.js, so  the external libraries were no longer required. The adapters have continued to be  maintained, proving useful for applications using multiple JavaScript libraries.  The following screenshot shows the Ext and base library relations. To use Ext  components, you need to use a base library, either ext-base.js or a third party  library with its adapter, together with the complete Ext library ext-all.js or a  subset of the files making up the Ext library.  [ 359 ]   Performance Tuning Your JavaScript  Removing duplicate functionality Because APEX 4.0 automatically includes the jQuery library jquery-1.4.2.min. js in page headers, swapping the ext-base.js file with the ext-jquery-adaptor. js file in your APEX page templates is a very simple way to eliminate duplicated  functionality in the base library and reduce the size of the Ext footprint.  Removing unused components Removing unused components from the Ext library to create a custom build is  quite straight-forward using the JSBuilder2 utility. Start by copying and renaming  the ext.jsb2 file. Then, you use an iterative process, removing some components,  compiling the custom build and testing against your application checking for errors  until you are satisfied you have an optimal library.  I've found the simplest approach, which is to start from the Ext All package and  work backwards from there. The following code shows the "Ext All No Core" and  "Ext All" packages:  {     "name": "Ext All No Core",     "file": "ext-all-no-core.js",     "isDebug": true,     "includeDeps": true,     "pkgDeps": [         "pkgs ext-foundation.js",         "pkgs cmp-foundation.js",         "pkgs ext-dd.js",         "pkgs data-foundation.js",         "pkgs data-json.js",  ** snipped **          "pkgs pkg-forms.js",         "pkgs pkg-grid-foundation.js",         "pkgs pkg-grid-editor.js",         "pkgs pkg-grid-property.js",         "pkgs pkg-grid-grouping.js"     ],     "fileIncludes": [] },{     "name": "Ext All",     "file": "ext-all.js",     "isDebug": true,     "includeDeps": true,     "pkgDeps": [  [ 360 ]   Chapter 11          "pkgs ext-core.js",         "ext-all-no-core.js"     ],     "fileIncludes": [] }  You can see here that the Ext All package combines just two files: ext-core.js and  ext-all-no-core.js; the second file is created by the Ext All No Core package.  Typically, I combine these two packages into a single custom package and comment  out individual package dependencies for my custom build:  {         "name": "Playpen Custom Build",         "file": "ext-playpen.js",         "isDebug": true,         "includeDeps": true,         "pkgDeps": [             "pkgs ext-core.js",             "pkgs ext-foundation.js",             "pkgs cmp-foundation.js",             "pkgs ext-dd.js",             "pkgs data-foundation.js",             "pkgs data-json.js",             "pkgs data-xml.js",             "pkgs data-grouping.js",             "ZZZpkgs direct.js",             "pkgs resizable.js",             "pkgs window.js",             "ZZZpkgs state.js",             "ZZZpkgs data-list-views.js",             "pkgs pkg-tabs.js",             "pkgs pkg-buttons.js",             "pkgs pkg-toolbars.js",             "ZZZpkgs pkg-history.js",             "pkgs pkg-tips.js",             "pkgs pkg-tree.js",             "ZZZpkgs pkg-charts.js",             "pkgs pkg-menu.js",             "pkgs pkg-forms.js",             "pkgs pkg-grid-foundation.js",             "pkgs pkg-grid-editor.js",             "ZZZpkgs pkg-grid-property.js",             "ZZZpkgs pkg-grid-grouping.js"         ],         "fileIncludes": []     }  [ 361 ]               Performance Tuning Your JavaScript  Unfortunately, the JSB2 format doesn't currently support commenting out lines,  something that will be addressed in a future release by Sencha. As a work-around,  you can comment out lines by creating an invalid path, as I've done here by prefixing  package paths with ZZZ. When you are completely sure that the packages aren't  required, the commented lines can be completely removed.  Once you have eliminated all the packages you can, the next step is to remove files  within packages. This is a fairly aggressive step, something you would only consider  when you're about to do a production release. The benefit of simply eliminating  packages is that the Sencha team has already been through the process of identifying  dependencies and sequencing the files to build. Despite their efforts, it's not always  obvious which files should be bundled together.  For example, in the earlier custom build, I kept the pkg-grid-editor.js   package for editable grids because the TableGrid component created in Chapter 9,  Getting Interactive with GridPanels, would fail if this package wasn't present. This   was counter-intuitive, because the package was specifically for editable grids and   the TableGrid component wasn't editable.  It turns out that the TableGrid component was dependent on one file within the pkg- grid-editor.js package, allowing other files to be commented out:  {         "name": "Grid Editor",         "file": "pkgs pkg-grid-editor.js",         "isDebug": true,         "pkgs": ["pkgs pkg-grid-foundation.js"],         "fileIncludes": [{             "text": "CellSelectionModel.js",             "path": "ZZZsrc widgets grid "         },{             "text": "EditorGrid.js",             "path": "src widgets grid "         },{             "text": "GridEditor.js",             "path": "ZZZsrc widgets grid "         }]     }  The process for eliminating individual files within packages is far more time  consuming. Your testing needs to be more thorough, but the effort does gradually  add up to give you a smaller Ext Library, resulting in faster downloads and a more  responsive application.  [ 362 ]   Minimizing Application JavaScript Having already gone through the JSB2 file format, this section focuses more on  structuring your application build file. I'm using the following JSB2 file to assemble  my JavaScript files and CSS and image assets:  Chapter 11  {     "projectName": "Playpen",     "deployDir": "playpen-1.0",     "licenseText": "Playpen JS Library 1.0",     "pkgs": [{         "name": "Ext Library",         "file": "pkg ext-playpen-plus.js",         "isDebug": true,         "fileIncludes": [{             "text": "ext-playpen.js",             "path": ".. extjs "         },{             "text": "TabCloseMenu.js",             "path": ".. extjs examples ux "         }]     },{         "name": "Base Components",         "file": "pkg ext-extensions.js",         "isDebug": true,         "fileIncludes": [{             "text": "apex_4_0_overrides.js",             "path": "apex "         },{             "text": "core.js",             "path": "apex "         },{             "text": "Override.Ext.Button.js",             "path": "apex "         },{             "text": "Override.Ext.form.ComboBox.js",             "path": "apex "         },{             "text": "Ext.apex.Report.js",             "path": "apex "         },{             "text": "Ext.apex.tree.TreePanel.js",             "path": "apex "         },{             "text": "Ext.apex.IFrameComponent.js",             "path": "apex "         },{  [ 363 ]   Performance Tuning Your JavaScript              "text": "Ext.apex.iFramePanel.js",             "path": "apex "         }]     },{         "name": "Application No IFrames",         "file": "pkg playpen.js",         "isDebug": true,         "includeDeps": true,         "pkgDeps": ["pkg ext-playpen-plus.js","pkg playpen-core.js"],         "fileIncludes": [{             "text": "Ext.apex.Viewport.js",             "path": "apex "         },{             "text": "application.js",             "path": "APP "         }]     }],     "resources": [{         "src": ". ",         "dest": ". ",         "filters": ".*"     },{         "src": "playpen-book.jsb2",         "dest": "playpen-book.jsb2",         "filters": ".*"     }]}  It assembles the JavaScript resources into logical packages, sequencing the files in  dependency order.  The first package is the Ext Library package:  {         "name": "Ext Library",         "file": "pkg ext-playpen-plus.js",         "isDebug": true,         "fileIncludes": [{             "text": "ext-playpen.js",             "path": ".. extjs "         },{             "text": "TabCloseMenu.js",             "path": ".. extjs examples ux "         }] }  [ 364 ]   It includes the optimized library from our earlier work, containing just the Ext  packages and files we need for our application. It also contains an additional Ext  file not included in the standard Ext library. The Ext files have been included in the  application build, so only two JavaScript files need to be included in the APEX page  template: the ext-jquery-adaptor.js file and playpen.js containing both the   Ext library and custom application JavaScript. This builds a package file ext- playpen-plus.js.  Chapter 11  Next is the Base Components package:    },{         "name": "Base Components",         "file": "pkg ext-extensions.js",         "isDebug": true,         "fileIncludes": [{             "text": "apex_4_0_overrides.js",             "path": "apex "         },{             "text": "core.js",             "path": "apex "         },{             "text": "Override.Ext.Button.js",             "path": "apex "         },{  ** more components snipped **          },{             "text": "Ext.apex.iFramePanel.js",             "path": "apex "         }]     },{  This package includes APEX over-rides, a core.js file, and several custom  components. Keeping any APEX over-rides in a separate file allows changes to be  easily managed when the next version of APEX is released.  The core file contains all namespaces for custom components and modified values  for Ext constants. Keeping this information in a separate file ensures that all  declarations happen at the beginning of the combined package, reducing the risk of  dependencies occurring in an incorrect sequence.  Examples of settings within the core file are:     Namespaces used for custom components Ext.ns "Ext.apex", "Ext.apex.data", "Ext.apex.grid", "Ext.apex.tree" ;     Blank image  using Oracle APEX image   [ 365 ]   Performance Tuning Your JavaScript  Ext.BLANK_IMAGE_URL = Ext.isIE6  Ext.isIE7  Ext.isAir ?  ' i 1px_trans.gif' : 'data:image gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAID  AMDAwAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==';     Override default month names to force 3 character upper case Date.monthNames = ["JANUARY", "FEBRUARY", "MARCH", "APRIL", "MAY",  "JUNE", "JULY", "AUGUST", "SEPTEMBER", "OCTOBER", "NOVEMBER",  "DECEMBER"];  Including all namespaces in a single file means namespaces don't need to be included  in individual files.  The application file is next, which combines the contents of the earlier packages:      },{         "name": "Application No IFrames",         "file": "pkg playpen.js",         "isDebug": true,         "includeDeps": true,         "pkgDeps": ["pkg ext-playpen-plus.js","pkg playpen-core.js"],         "fileIncludes": [{             "text": "Ext.apex.Viewport.js",             "path": "apex "         },{             "text": "application.js",             "path": "APP "         }]     }],  It lists the earlier packages as dependencies with the includeDeps flag set to true,  ensuring that all earlier scripts referenced are included in the generated file. It also  includes files specific to a "No IFrames" application. With very little effort, a second  build could be included specifically for an IFrame application.  Summary In this chapter, we have looked at ways of keeping our JavaScript lightweight, using  recommendations from Yahoo and Google add-ons for Firebug. We have discussed  the benefits of enabling HTTP compression to reduce file size when it's transmitted  "over the wire".  Reducing file size "at the source" was also covered, learning about and using  JSBuilder2 to build a customized lighter version of the Ext Library with unused  components removed. We also used the JSBuilder2 utility to combine and minified  our custom application JavaScript.
