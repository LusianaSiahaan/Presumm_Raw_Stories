For being awesome, cute, perfect and very  humble. Couldn’t have done it without you.   Foreword  I’m glad you’ve made it this far. In this book, you will learn to create a web  application  with  Django  3,  a  web  framework  for  the  Python programming  language.  You  will  learn  the  essential  web  development concepts and all the necessary information to get started with Django 3. But before Django 3, we will learn the basic concepts of programming and the Programming Language Python 3.9.    We will build a blogging web application with added features.  Users will be  able  to  post  blogs.  The  application  will  also  have  a  feature  that  allows users to post questions and provide answers to them.    Our blog application will be focused on the theme of finance; that is, our blogs will be focused on finance and how people can improve their finance, do  their  taxes,  tips  on  savings,  etc.  Our  question answer  section  will  be focused on finance, as well.    If you note, you can convert this application to any theme you like, i.e., tech,  writing,  etc.  We,  however,  will  be  making  this  blog  a  website  that focuses on finance.    By the end of this book, you’ll have enough knowledge in Django 3 and web  development,  in  general,  to  build  web  apps  on  your  own.  You’ll  also know how to deploy your Django 3 Application in a Serverless Environment in a Cloud.    About this book  This  book  is  designed  to  be  used  both  digital  and  printed.  Therefore,  I have made plenty of screenshots for people who like to read the book  ebook and  printed   without  immediately  implementing  the  code.  This  ensures  a smooth and hassle-free reading experience.      If,  on  the  other  hand,  you  want  to  learn  the  contents  as  quickly  as possible, you can clone the official GitHub repository and save time. I highly recommend  you  not  to  use  the  GitHub  repository  at  the  beginning  of  this journey,  especially  if  you  are  new  to  Django.  Type  the  code  symbol  by symbol  Repository: https:  github.com AndreyBulezyuk Django-3-Book.    yourself.  You   the  Github   find   can   This  ensures  that  you  fail  quickly  in  the  beginning  and  learn  about  the common pitfalls  like forgetting to execute the migrations, not updating the Entity, etc. . You deprive yourself of this learning opportunity when simply clone the code.    the  content   The  structure  of   is  somewhat  different  from  other programming books. It’s a mix of theory and practice – where practice comes first, and the theory bits are injected into the sub-steps. This ensures that you learn  the  practical  and  real-world  workflow  of  building  a  Django  Website. And while you are practicing it, you are learning the theory in tiny-sized bits just at the right time. This way, you won’t be overwhelmed by the dry theory. I genuinely believe that this format will have the best impact on your learning journey.  Scientific literature has shown that the best way to learn is by doing, so always try to solve the problems at the end of the chapter. If you are having difficulty solving some of them, do not worry – nobody said programming was easy, remember to take a break when you are feeling tired and be sure to go through the example problems and their solutions.   PYTHON 3  Introduction  This  is  an  Introduction  to  Python  3,  which  means  we  will  cover  the Basics of Python3 and the basic concepts of programming. Python 3.9 is the current  stable  release,  which  means  you  will  be  learning  the  newest  stuff there is. Why Python?  Python 3 is easy to learn, it is the fastest growing language in the world, which means it has a large community behind it, it has thousands of different libraries with new ones being added every day, it is widely used for Machine Learning,  Cloud  Computing,  Web  Development,  Web  Scrapping,  Desktop Development and pretty much anything you can think of  even Game & App Dev .  is  an   Python   interpreted,  object-oriented,  high-level  programming language. Interpreted means that every python code file is ‘ready to go’ and does not require any additional steps to run it, object-oriented means that the language  is  designed  with  the  intent  of  creating  high-level  complex abstractions  called  ‘objects’.  Python  by  design  is  highly  readable,  that coupled with the large quantity of different libraries and a strong community is what makes it a beginner friendly language.  Syntax and Variables What is a variable  Think  of  a  variable  as  a  name  referring  to  an  object.  For  example, consider you have a dog and you are describing him to a friend, when you say ‘Max is a young puppy’ Max is just an identifier and every time you use the word ‘Max’ what you are actually thinking of is the dog itself.   myDogName = 'Max' print myDogName  myDogName = ‘Max’  In  programming  it  is  exactly  the  same  -  when  writing  ‘myDogName’ what I actually am referring to is ‘Max’ - the name of my dog. To see that this is the case we can simply use the ‘print’ command to retrieve the content of the variable.  Basic Data Types in Python  languages   In  most  programming   the  programmer  must  specify beforehand what type will the type of data stored in that variable be, the most common  of  those  types  are  –  natural  numbers   integers ,  decimal  point numbers  floating point real values  and text  strings .    In  Python  this  process  is  handled  automatically  and  is  hidden  from  the programmer and thus makes the code much easier to read. To see for yourself we  will  use  the  built-in  ‘type  ’  function  which  gives  us  as  a  result  the underlying type of the variable.  myString = "A great day to learn Python" print type myString     myInt = 42 print type myInt    myFloat = 3.14 print type myFloat    Variable Manipulation Variable Assignment  This is one of the most fundamental operations you will deal with as a programmer, since if variables are empty boxes, assigning a value to them is the act of filling them up. The assignment is done by using the ‘equals’  =  sign. To demonstrate how the assignment operator works and how the data type  changes  between  assignments  we  will  use  the  ‘type’  and  ‘print’ functions we just discussed in the following example.      myVariable = 10 print type myVariable    myVariable = 10.1 print type myVariable    myVariable = "Yes, I can do this" print type myVariable    In this example you can clearly see that variables are ‘dynamic’ in nature, that is they do not have a predefined type or property they must adhere to. That is why I am first able to use the variable to hold a natural number, then a float, and then a string.  This leads us to another important aspect of the process of assignment, there  are  two  parts  to  the  assignment  the  ‘Left-Hand  Side’  and  the  ‘Right- Hand Side’ or for short ‘LHS’ and ‘RHS’, determined by which side of the equals sign they are situated. The LHS is the variable that is being assigned to while the RHS is what is being assigned.   In other words, the LHS is the box and the RHS is the data that goes into the box. Note that this is not exactly what is happening underneath the hood, in actuality everything in Python is an object and variable names – point to these objects, but for now this is the analogy we will go with.  In the following example you will see that both the RHS and the LHS can be variables and thus our box-data analogy is not very clear, since both sides appear to be boxes. What assignment means in this case is that we want to copy the data contained in the RHS and just like before put that copy into the LHS box. Keep in mind copying the contents is not always the case, when we are dealing with objects, but more on that in Chapter Six.  A = 1000 B = A    B is the LHS and A is the RHS print B   C = "My Sentence" D = C print D   Note we can overwrite the already existing contents of the LHS with assignment E = "Pizza" F = "Broccoli" E = F print E   Note  that  when  assigning  data  values  to  variables,  the  variable  should always be on the left-hand side of the assignment operator. Because data is not a variable and thus by our box analogy is not a box and therefore cannot hold data.  myVariable = 20 10 = myVariable This will result in an error 'Cannot assign to literal' Which  is  very  intuitive,  since  10  is  not  a  box  and  doesn't  make  sense  for  it  to  hold  anything   This is an example shows what not to do, using our previous analogy – variables are the boxes in which we put in our objects data , thus it does not make  sense  to  try  and  put  anything  inside  data,  because  by  definition  only boxes can contain things.  Another example of what not to do is, assigning a variable that has not  been defined yet  myVariable = 10 myVariable = somethingNotDefined This results in a 'not defined' error, because Python cannot evaluate the RHS, since we've never specified what it means  In  the  following  example  you  will  see  how  we  can  combine  our knowledge  of  the  dynamic  nature  of  Python  variables  and  how  the assignment operator works.      A = 10 B = "Not a number" A = B print type A    Arithmetic Expressions  We learned what variables are, their types and how to assign them. Now we  will  focus  on  the  numeric  types  of  data  and  how  create  arithmetic expressions, just like we learned in school.  a = 10 b = 20 c = a + b print c   Note  that  even  though  in  this  case  the  result  is  the  same,  arithmetic expressions  in  programming  are  not  the  same  as  solving  mathematical equations,  thus  it  is  best  not  to  think  of  the  above  example  as  finding  the   unknown variable – c, but more in terms of what we discussed in the previous paragraph – LHS is the variable to which we will assign the result of the RHS expression. If we keep this in mind the principles are the same as previously discussed and we will focus on evaluating the RHS expression.  We will discuss and show examples of the classic mathematical operators  – addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  print 50+10  print 50-10  print 50*10  print 50 10   Everything works as you would expect it to, each of them is binary which means  it  needs  two  variables  or  pieces  of  data  –  called  operands.  The subtraction operator can also be unary, meaning it can take a single operand, that  is  the  operation  called  –  negation.  Also,  it  is  worth  noting  that  when calling the division operator regardless if the result is a whole number, the type  of  the  result  is  always  ‘float’,  when  a  variable  is  of  type  float  even though  it’s  a  whole  number  Python  displays  the  number  as  10.0  to  remind you of it.  There are three other operators beside the classical ones – exponentiation,  modulo, and floor division.  myVariable = 100 print -myVariable   floatExperiment = myVariable 10 print type floatExperiment    print 2**10  Exponentiation  moduloDivision = 999%100 print moduloDivision    floorDivision = 999  100 print floorDivision  print type floorDivision   Floor Division  The  first  operand  in  exponentiation  Is  the  base  number  and  the  second operand is its power, hence 2 to the power of 10 is 1024. Modulo Division is the  act  of  taking  the  remainder  of  the  division  of  the  first  operand  by  the second  operand.  Floor  division  on  the  other  hand  acts  the  same  way  as ordinary division, but it always rounds down to an integer value, so in other words – division without remainder.  Another  aspect  of  arithmetic  expressions  is  the  problem  of  operator precedence, just like in mathematics division and multiplication have a higher priority  than  addition  and  subtraction,  additionally  exponentiation  has  the highest precedence of them.  If we want to enforce a specific order of operations, just like in math class –  we  use  brackets  and  if  you  are  not  certain  on  which  operator  takes precedence it is always a good practice to use brackets.  Note  that  the  same  problems  outlined  in  the  previous  paragraph  apply here  and  for  any  future  chapters  as  well.  Using  not  defined  variables  will result in an error.  noBrackets = 1000 10+50 print noBrackets   withBrackets = 1000  10+50  print withBrackets   A = 10 B = 20 C = 100 Result = A + B + C + Z    Z is not defined print Result    This will be a common theme in this book, so make sure you think about how what we have previously learned can be applied to what we are currently learning as this is the basis of advanced programming.  Variable Names     There are four rules to which every Python variable name must adhere to:  A  variable  name  must  start  with  a  letter  or  the  underscore  A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and  character  underscores  Variable  names  are  case-sensitive   git,  Git  and  GIT  are  three  different variable names   Keywords cannot be used as variable names  Keywords  are  reserved  words  which  cannot  be  used  as  variable  or function  names,  each  of  them  serves  a  specific  purpose  and  using  the keyword invokes a certain behavior from Python. Examples of keywords are: if,  elif,  else,  def,  import,  False,  True,  del,  break,  continue,  for,  from,  while etc.  The following example lists valid and invalid variable names in Python  Valid variable names: myvar = "GitAcademy" my_var = "GitAcademy" _my_var_ = "GitAcademy" myVar = "GitAcademy" MYVAR = "GitAcademy" my42var = "GitAcademy" MY999__VAR_999 = "GitAcadmy"  Invalid variable names: my-var = "GitAcademy" 9myvar = "GitAcademy" my var = "GitAcademy" continue = "GitAcademy"   Data Types in Python List  A list is a collection of objects. Lists are characterized for being:     Ordered – items in the list have an order that does not change Changeable – We can change, add, and remove items in the list Allows Duplicates – We can have more than one item with the  same value  A list is a collection of objects enclosed by square brackets  myLetters = ['a','b','c','d'] print myLetters   Note that with Lists we can hold values and variables of different types,  so an expression like this is completely valid  myVariable = 'Variable'  myList = [1, -1, 3.14, 'GitAcademy', myVariable] print myList   Tuple  Tuples  are  collections  of  data  that  can  hold  multiple  items  in  a  single  variable. Tuples are characterized for being:    Ordered – items in the list have an order that does not change Unchangeable – After creating the tuple we cannot modify its  Allows Duplicates – We can have more than one item with the  contents  same value   A tuple is a collection of objects enclosed by curved brackets  myTuple =  1,-1,3.14,'GitAcademy'   Notice that we can use variables when defining our tuple, however once the  tuple  is  defined  all  of  its  member  objects  are  immutable  –  meaning unchangeable.  myFloat = 3.14 myString = 'Some String Data'  myTuple =  myString, myFloat  print myTuple   Set  Sets,  similarly  to  tuples  are  collections  of  data  that  can  hold  multiple  items in a single variable. Sets are characterized for being:    Unordered – items in the set do not have an order Unchangeable  –  After  creating  the  set  we  cannot  modify  its  Duplicates Not Allowed – Sets cannot have two items with the  contents  same value  A set is a collection of objects enclosed by curly brackets  myVariable = 'GitAcademy'  mySet = {1, -1, 3.14, 'Joe', myVariable} print mySet   Notice  that  running  the  first  example  numerous  times,  displays  the members of the set in a different order – that is a direct cause of the collection   being ‘unordered’.  In  the  following  example  take  note  of  the  third  property  of  sets  –  not allowing  any  duplicates.  In  this  case  the  contents  of  myVariable  are GitAcademy and I have entered GitAcademy as a string literal a second time.  myVariable = 'GitAcademy'  mySet = {'GitAcademy', myVariable, 3.14} print mySet   As expected, the resulting tuple contains GitAcademy only once.  Dictionary  characterized for being:    A  dictionary  is  a  collection  of  key:  value  pairs.  Dictionaries  are  Unordered – items in the dictionary do not have an order Changeable  –  We  can  change,  add,  and  remove  items  in  a  Duplicates Not Allowed – Dictionaries cannot have two items  dictionary  with the same value  I will only demonstrate how a dictionary looks like in order to frontload the concept, however do not worry about how they work exactly as we will discuss that in the following segment.  myDictionary = { 'Year Of Graduation': 2020, 'Final Grade': 10.0, 'Name of Student': 'John Doe', }  print myDictionary['Name of Student']    Data-type Methods  As the name suggests data-type methods are methods functions  that are specific to a certain data type. They make it possible for us to interact with these objects in many different ways, most common of which are – adding elements, removing elements and searching for elements.  First of all, we should note that the ‘.’ dot  operator is used to access class members  that  are  defined  for  that  object.  The  class  is  the  template  for  the object  and  class  members  can  be  variables  and  functions.  For  now,  do  not worry  too  much  about  it,  we  will  discuss  at  length  what  exactly  does  that mean in Chapter Seven, for now we just need a working understanding of the concept  –  that  is,  every  time  we  use  the  dot  operator,  we  are  accessing  a member of the object.  List Methods  List are quite likely the most used type for collections of objects and this is  why  it  is  very  important  to  build  a  solid  understanding  of  how  to manipulate  them,  since  as  of  now  the  different  collections  of  objects  we introduced, seem somewhat static and dull. Worry not, when we get through what  data-type  methods  are  and  how  to  use  them  you  will  gain  an appreciation for the complexity they allow for and the elegant ways in which they can be used for problem-solving.  Consider this introductory paragraph as a way for the author to stress how important  the  following  segment  will  be  for  a  proper  introduction  into Python.  Unless  you  are  already  confident  in  these  concepts  consider revisiting this section at least a few times.  As of now we learned how to define different collections of objects and what  their  properties  are.  Now  we  will  introduce  methods  to  interact  with lists, first and foremost we will explain the list append method that will allow us to add new items into the list.   Retrieve by Index  Since  lists  are  ordered,  that  means  we  can  index  them.  The  act  of indexing  means  that  we  can  retrieve  an  element  from  a  list  using  its  index number. The index number tells us how many elements after the first one, our element is situated at, so an index number of 1 means that this is the second element  remember that in programming counting always begins from 0 . An index number of 5 means this is the sixth number and so on and so forth.  I  will  take  this  as  an  opportunity  to  mention  the  ‘len  ’  method  which returns the number of elements in the collection. If we have an empty list – len   would yield the number zero. If we have 3 elements in the list – len   will yield the number 3 and in general If we have n elements in the collection len   will give us the number n.  Len    myList = ['Orange','Apple','Banana'] print len myList   print myList[5]   We define the list in the same way as previously discussed. When using the  ‘len  ’  function  we  see  it  returns  the  number  3,  which  is  exactly  the number of elements in the list. Indexing the list is done with the notation used in the second print statement, we can see that retrieving an item at an index is done  by  using  the  variable  name  immediately  followed  by  square  brackets containing the index number.  Note  that  if  we  use  an  index  number  that  is  larger  than  the  number  of elements minus one  since we are counting from zero  we will get a ‘index out of range’ error and the program will not run.  append     Instead of retrieving an item in the collection – appending is the act of  adding one new item at the end of the list.  myList = ['Orange','Apple','Banana'] print len myList   myList.append 'Chocolate Bar'  listLength = len myList  print listLength  print myList[listLength-1]   In this code snippet we are using the same list as in the previous example and we want to add another item to it. To do that we use the append   class method  I am specifying it is a class method since you cannot append items to a tuple for example – it is specific to objects of type list .  After  we  execute  the  append  command,  we  save  the  result  of  the len   command  into  a  variable.  When  printing  the  same  variable,  we  can  now clearly see that the number of objects in the list has increased by one which is indeed what happened.  We can now use retrieval by index to print out our newest addition to our collection. As we previously mentioned – the appended item goes to the back of our list, so to retrieve it we used the last index which is the length of the list minus one  because the first item is with an index of zero .  Insert    The  insert  command  is  similar  to  append  with  the  added  caveat  of  us being able to specify at which index do we want to add a new object to the list. The insert method takes in two parameters, the first one being the index at  which  we  would  want  to  insert  our  new  object  in  the  collection  and  the second one being the object itself.  myList = ['Orange','Apple','Banana'] print myList[0]    myList.insert 0,'Chocolate Bar'  print myList[0]   Here we inserted our newest object at the first index – meaning the front of the list. As you can see after the insertion when we retrieve the first object it  is  indeed  the  object  we  just  added.  This  implies  the  natural  consequence that when we insert an object at the I-th index the indices of all objects after the I-th index will increase their index by one, while the indices of the objects before the insertion index will remain the same.  Pop    In the same way we used append and insert to add new entries into our collection – now we can remove items with the pop method. Pop   takes in a single argument – the index of the item we would like to remove.  myList = ['Orange','Apple','Banana'] print myList[0]  myList.pop 0  print len myList   print myList[0]   Using the same example, we can verify that the first item in the collection is indeed ‘Orange’ and as you might expect when we pop the element at the first  index   which  is  specified  by  the  number  zero   the  length  of  the  list shrinks by one and the new first item is our previously second item.  Again, the same principle applies as with insertion, but in reverse – when we delete the I-th item from the list the indices of all subsequent items are reduced by one, while the indices of items before the item we have removed remain unchanged.  Set Methods  The concept of a set first arose in the field of mathematics and operations   with sets are fundamentally mathematical. The defining feature of a set is that it  is  both  unordered  and  does  not  allow  duplicates.  Which  implies  that  all elements in the set share a similar property  hence why they are in the same set .     Add    The  add  method  is  used  to  add  another  object  to  the  set,  it  takes  in  a  single parameter – the object to be added.  expensivePets = {'Parrots','Monkeys','Tigers','Lions'} expensivePets.add 'Tigers'  print expensivePets   In this example you can see a set of items – in this case animals, which share the common property of being expensive. It just so happens that we add an animal that was already in the set. As expected, the updated set remains   the  same  as  ‘Tigers’  were  already  in  the  set  of  expensive  animals.  It  is important  to  understand  why  this  is  the  case.  If  we  think  of  the  set  as  a collection of objects sharing the same property it does not make sense to add ‘Tigers’ a second time to the set since an object can either have or not have a certain property.  Intersection    Intersection is a method of a set that takes in any number of sets as its parameters. If as previously discussed, sets contain elements with the same property,  then  an  intersection  of  sets  is  a  set  containing  the  elements  that satisfy all of the properties.  expensivePets = {'Parrots','Monkeys','Tigers','Lions'} dangerousAnimals = {'Lions','Tigers','Hyennas','Rhinos'} dangerousPets = expensivePets.intersection dangerousAnimals  print dangerousPets   In this example we have our previous set of expensive pets and another set  of  dangerous  animals  and  we  make  the  observation  that  expensive  pets that are dangerous animals are indeed dangerous pets to own.  That is exactly what we achieve by using the intersection method. When we call the intersection method it takes only the common elements to all sets. Which if properly labeled are animals that are both expensive and dangerous.  expensivePets = {'Parrots','Monkeys','Tigers','Lions'} dangerousAnimals = {'Lions','Tigers','Hyennas','Rhinos'} dangerousPets = dangerousAnimals.intersection expensivePets  print dangerousPets   Notice that this is exactly the same example, however we have called the intersection method from the other set and the result remains the same. This is so, because taking the common elements of several sets is a commutative operation – that is, it does not matter what the order of operations is – just   like with addition 7 + 5 = 5 + 7.  Union    Similarly, to the intersection method – union takes any number of sets as parameters.  Continuing  with  the  notion  that  sets  are  collections  of  objects with the same property – the union method returns a set that contains all of the  elements  from  all  sets.  So,  in  a  sense  it  is  the  dual  operation  of intersection.  lowNumbers = {1, 2, 3 ,4, 5, 6} highNumbers = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} allNumbers = lowNumbers.union highNumbers  print allNumbers  commonNumbers = lowNumbers.intersection highNumbers  print commonNumbers   In this example you can see that the resulting set has all the numbers from the low numbers set and all of the numbers from the high numbers set. Again, the union method is commutative, so it does not matter in what order we take the  union  of  the  sets.  Below  I  have  provided  as  an  example  how  the intersection of both sets would look like.  Dictionary Methods  Dictionaries are a collection of key value pairs, where each key refers to a specific value. The role of the key is identical of that of the index in lists. The key is said to ‘point’ to its respective value. When we access a specific key in our dictionary it returns us the value to which it points.  Accessing Dictionary Values  studentRecord = { 'Graduation Year': 2020, 'Grade': 10.0, 'Name': 'John Doe',   'Country': 'Germany', }  print studentRecord['Name']   The notation is exactly the same as when we retrieved values with indices when we learned about list methods. The difference here is that dictionaries are unordered, thus we cannot simply state that we would like to retrieve the second element of the collection. However, we have a notion for keys, which play the role of the index. If this was a list and we wanted to access the third element we would say studentRecord[2], instead here we use the key ‘Name’ which maps to its respective value.  Adding new key-value pairs  doing it.  Doing  this  is  very  intuitive,  so  much  so,  you  might  not  realize  you  are  studentRecord = { 'Graduation Year': 2020, 'Grade': 10.0, 'Name': 'John Doe', 'Country': 'Germany', }  studentRecord['Honors Student'] = True print studentRecord['Honors Student']   Using the same example, we decide that we want to have an additional field in our student record called ‘Honors Student’, in order for that to happen all we need to do is to remember the exact syntax or variable assignment and apply it in the same way as shown in the example.  What happens is that we assign a new value to a new key. Sure enough, when we check for the contents of the new key the data is there. Note that the syntax for changing the value of an already existing key is exactly the same.   Data typecasting  In  the  opening  paragraph  of  this  chapter,  we  briefly  discussed  the different types of variables and how Python automatically handles this for us. That is not always to our advantage and we sometimes need the behavior of a specific data type.  myVariable = '3.14' print type myVariable    myVariable = float myVariable  print myVariable + 100   print type myVariable    myVariable = '1' secondVariable = '2' print myVariable + secondVariable   print int myVariable +int secondVariable    In this example we have a variable of type string which we use the float   command to cast to the type of float, which we can which allows us to make use of the expected functionality of a float number.  In  the  second  example  you  can  see  that  the  default  behavior  of  the addition operator  +  is to concatenate strings, so if we want to use it in the sense of adding numbers, we have to tell that to Python explicitly by using the int   command.  User Input  So far, we have learned a lot about different data types and their behavior however  everything  is  rather  static  and  unchanging.  Now  we  are  about  to change that by learning to read user input.   myName = input "Enter your name: "  print  "Hello,", myName   To prompt the user to enter something all you need to do is call the input function and optionally pass a message to the user as a parameter. The input function  is  the  right-hand  side  of  an  assignment  operator  and  the  input  is stored in the left-hand side.  myNumber = input "Please enter a number: "  print type myNumber   myNumber = int myNumber  print "This is the number squared:",myNumber**2   A key point to remember is that the input function always returns a string object. It is very important to cast your input to the expected variable type so as to avoid unexpected behavior in your program.  listOfFoods = input "Enter your favorite foods separated by a space: \n" .split   print listOfFoods   In this example we introduce the split method– which we use on top of the input method in order to separate the items from our input in a list. If we were to not use the split method, we would end up with a string that contains the entire input. You can try this for yourself by removing split.   Conditional Expressions What is a Conditional Expression?  A conditional expression is a computer science paradigm common to all programming  languages.  The  idea  is  that  we  want  to  check  if  a  certain condition is present and then act upon it. It may sound somewhat abstract so let me give you a real-world example – imagine you are about to go to school when you see that it is raining outside.  You think to yourself – if it is raining then I will take an umbrella with me. Is it raining or not is the condition we want to evaluate and taking the umbrella  is  the  action  we  would  perform.  This  is  what  is  called  a  block diagram. This block diagram specifically represents the logical flow of an ‘if statement’. The black dot at the top Is the entry point for our program and the flow of the program is given by the direction of the arrows.      In this example – the program starts. We check if the condition A is true or not. If it is true, we continue acting out B, and if it is not, we act out C. The program ends.  In the terms of our example this would be interpreted the following way:  -          Condition: A – Is it raining?  Consequence: B – Take umbrella Consequence: C – Continue as usual  Note that this may be a little confusing as this mysterious C is not defined in our example, but bear with me for a few more examples and I promise we   will get to that.  What is a Logical Expression?  We will make a detour to discuss how to express the condition of our ‘if statement’.  The  condition  is  what  is  called  a  logical  expression.  Logical expressions are formulas  expressions  that evaluate to true or false. So, for the purposes of this tutorial, you can consider everything that can be answer by either true, or false – as a logical expression.  Logical comparison  Previously, we used the equals sign to assign the right-hand side to the left-hand  side.  If,  however,  we  use  the  equals  sign  twice  in  a  row  –  that means  we  want  to  compare  if  the  right-hand  side  is  equal  to  the  left-hand side. Note that when it comes to comparisons the left-hand side and the right- hand  side  have  the  same  purpose  and  therefore  properties,  unlike  with assignment.  As discussed – the result of a logical expressions is always True or False, depending if the expression is... well True or False. Another type of logical comparison is lesser greater than.  A = 10 B = 20 C = 10  print A == B  print A == C   A = 10 B = 20 C = 10  print A < B  print A < C    Surely enough, the result is again True False. The idea is the same as with comparing if two values are equal. Here we compare if the left-hand side is lesser than  the right-hand  side. Note  that  it is  a strict  comparison –  the  lhs number  has  to  be  strictly  lesser  than  the  rhs  number.  The  greater  than operator  works  in  the  exact  same  way,  so  I  will  leave  it  up  to  you  to experiment with.  If we do not want a strict comparison then we will use the lesser-than-or- equal  or  greater-than-or-equal  operators,  which,  as  you  probably  suspect  – work in the exact same way as their strict counterparts.  A = 10 B = 20 C = 10  print A <= B  print A <= C   Logical Operator: And  Now that we discussed how to do logical comparisons, we will learn how  to build complex logical statements.  Imagine  we  want  to  know  if  a  number  is  in  the  range  of  1  and  100, unfortunately there is no operator that can do this for us, so we will have to do  it  ourselves.  The  logical  and  operator  takes  two  logical  expressions outputs True only when all of the expressions evaluate to True. To do that we use the keyword and  X = float input "Enter a number: "   answer = 1 < X and X < 100 print answer   When the number is between 1 and 100 both of the expressions evaluate to True. However, if it is above 100 or below 1 one expression evaluates to   True, but the other evaluates to False which is all that ‘and’ needs to return a False answer.  Logical Operator: Or  As  with  logical  and  –  logical  or  is  used  to  build  complex  logical statements, by taking in two logical expressions and returning True when at least  one  of  the  expressions  evaluates  to  True  and  returns  False  only  when both of the expressions are false.  In this problem statement we want to find out if the multiplication of two  numbers will result in an even number, without multiplying them.  A = int input "Enter A: "   B = int input "Enter B: "    answer = A%2==0 or B%2==0  print answer   Okay, so this example may be a little more convoluted so let me explain. A number is even when it is divisible by two. When multiplying two numbers if either of them is divisible by two, then the resulting number will also be divisible by two. That is exactly what our program statement is saying – if A is divisible by two or if B is divisible by two then the result will be divisible by two. All that is required for the result to be divisible by two is if either A or B be divisible by two.  Logical Operator: Not  Logical  Not  is  similar  to  and or,  that  it  modifies  in  some  manner  an already  logical  expression.  The  difference  is  that  it  takes  in  only  a  single expression and inverts it. Not True would mean False and Not False would mean  True.  So,  if  we  go  with  the  problem  where  we  check  if  a  number  is between  1  and  100  and  add  the  not  operator,  the  result  will  be  True  only   when the number is not in the interval 1-100.  X = float input "Enter a number: "   answer = not 1 < X and X < 100  print answer   Code Blocks  When writing an if statement we want to execute a bunch of commands if some criteria is met. But how does Python know which statements are part of the commands to be executed inside the if statement and which are not? That is by using code blocks here is an example in C++.  include   int main void  { int X = 42; if  X == 42  {    This is a code block  X = 1; X = 2; X = 3;   ... X = 100;  X = 101; return 0; }  }   No statements after this    will be part of the if statement  As  you  can  see,  we  are  doing  multiple  assignments  inside  the  if statements  and  the  curly  braces  help  the  C++  compiler  understand  which statements belong inside the if statements and which do not.  The  same  principle  applies  to  all  programming  languages.  In  Python, however,  there  are  no  braces  to  denote  this,  just  the  ‘:’  symbol  and  a consistent indentation.   if False: print "Hi"  print "Hi"  ... print "Hi"   print "Hi"   Because  the  condition  always  evaluates  to  False,  the  insides  of  the  if statements will never be read or reached. However, the syntax is correct, and the program runs seamlessly. You can try and change the indentation and see for yourself that Python will throw you an error.  IF statements  Finally, we are going to talk about if statements.  Before I continue with our  first  example,  I  just  want  to  mention  that  mastering  conditional expressions  is  a  necessary  part  for  any  programmer.  It  is  an  essential  tool, which forms the basis of loops and of other aspects of programming you will encounter further down the line.     Now to the example – We prompt the user to input his exam score. We do not know ahead of time anything about his score, but we want the program to tell  us  in  plain  English  if  the  user  has  passed  the  exam.  Here  is  the implementation.  myScore = int input "Enter your exam score 1-100 : "   if myScore >= 70: print "You have successfuly passed the course!"   You can see that the condition for passing the course is having a score higher  or  equal  than  70.  Let  us  do  another  example.  In  this  case  the  user inputs his score and we want to check if his score is a valid score.  myScore = int input "Input your score 1-100 : "   if 1   100: print "You have entered an incorrect score!"   We will take this as an opportunity to practice conditional expressions as well. I challenge you to modify this code so that it prints “You have entered a correct score” only when the score is between 1 and 100.  else and elif clauses  So far, we explored what happens when the condition of our if expression is met, the natural extension of that is to consider what to do if the condition   is false. If we consider the previous examples where we wanted to check if the entered score is valid, we can rewrite it as follows:  myScore = int input "Input your score 1-100 : "   if 1 <= myScore and myScore <= 100: print "The score is valid"  else:   print "You have entered an incorrect score!"   The reason this works and we do not need to specify a condition in front of the else clause is because logical expressions always evaluate to either true or false. Meaning that there are exactly two possibilities for our if statement – for the condition to evaluate to true and for us to enter the if code-block or for the  condition  to  evaluate  to  false  and  for  us  to  enter  the  else  code-block. There is no third option – except for the Python Executor to fail  e.g.: when myScore is being set to a string instead of integer .  Let us remodel one of our previous examples, if we have passed the test  or not.  myScore = int input "Enter your exam score 1-100 : "   if myScore >= 70: print "You have successfuly passed the course!"  else: print "You have failed the course!"   The logic is the same as in the previous example – we check if the score is  70  or  more  and  if  it  is  the  program  issues  the  corresponding  message, however if it is not – we enter the else clause.     Let us consider another case – a combination of our previous examples. First, we want to validate our score and then we want to check if the student passes or not.  myScore = int input "Input your score 1-100 : "    if 1 > myScore or myScore > 100: print "You have entered an incorrect score!"  elif myScore >= 70:   print "You have successfuly passed the course!"  else: print "You have failed the course!"   The  ‘elif’  clause  is  a  concatenation  of  the  keywords  ‘else’  and  ‘if’.  It would  not  make  any  difference  if  we  were  to  just  write  another  if  clause inside  the  else  of  the  primary  if  statement.  And  thus  you  would  create  a nested if-statement. You can consider this a convenience developed, because of the wide use of these types of expressions.  I will present you with a slightly more complex example to illustrate how nested  if-statements  are  used.  We  are  asked  to  write  a  survey  tracking customer satisfaction with our online product. In order to do so we ask our clients to rate our product and if the rating is not great, we ask them are they satisfied with the product, if they are, we thank them, if not, we ask them why they are not satisfied.   score = int input "Please rate our service  1-5  stars: "   if score   5: print "You have entered an invalid score."  elif score <=3: feedback = input "Are you satisfied with our service? y n\n"  if feedback == 'y':  print "Thank you for your feedback!"   elif feedback == 'n':  moreFeedback = input "What should we do to improve our service?\n"  print "Thank you for your feedback!"   else: print "Thank you for your awesome review!"   Having this much code makes it harder to read, this is why indentation comes in  handy in  order for  you  to orient  yourself as  to which  code  block does this statement belong to. Programming Loops  I gave you an early warning that complexity is going to ramp up quickly by the time we touch programing loops and here we are. I hope by now you are  somewhat  comfortable  with  logical  statements  and  conditional expressions, because they are a building block to the programming loop.  Introduction  A loop is a code segment which we would like to execute multiple times, usually changing the state of that code segment with each execution. If we had a number and we wanted to find out if the same number can be found in a list with 10 numbers, we would have to write 10 if statements – now that is not  very  elegant,  but  it  is  still  doable.  However  if  the  list  of  numbers  is determined  at  runtime  by  the  users  input  it  would  be  an  impossible  task. There  is  no  way  for  the  programmer  to  know  ahead  of  time  how  many  if statements to write. It is because of these kinds of problems that loops exist.  For Loops   Iterators  Before we get into for loops, we have to cover the concept of iterators. Any Python object that is iterable – which can return one element at a time can  have  an  iterator.  The  iterator  itself  is  the  current  element  that  is  being returned. A lot of the Python objects implement the iterator protocol – such as lists, tuples, strings etc.  myList = ['apple','orange','pear'] myIter = iter myList  print next myIter   print next myIter   print next myIter    We  have  a  list  of  items,  and  in  order  to  iterate  through  them  we  first create  the  iterator  object  and  call  its  built-in  function  ‘next’  which  does exactly that – goes to the next item in the iterated object. Note that if at the end  I  called  ‘next’  one  more  time  we  would  go  outside  the  bounds  of  the iterated  object  and  throw  a  ‘StopIterration’  Exception.  We  will  not  go  into much detail as this is only a stepping stone to our actual subject – for loops.  Ordinary for loop  The problem statement is the following – we have an iterable object, for instance  say  –  a  list.  We  want  to  do  some  manipulation  of  that  list elementwise.  This  is  the  logical  flow  of  our  program.  At  the  beginning  we  create  or fetch  e.g. from a Database  our iterable object. Then we check our condition  have we reached the end of the object  and if not, we enter the body of the for loop. We do that until we reach the end of the object at which point, we continue executing the rest of the program.      Using  the  same  example  as  with  the  iterators,  but  now  with  for  loops. fruit is our iterator and for each cycle through our loop we implicitly call the ‘next’  function.  Unsurprisingly  the  result  is  the  same.  Let  us  do  another example.  for number in range 20 : print number   Here  we  use  the  very  useful  ‘range’  function.  With  it  –  what  we  are   saying in essence is – loop through all the numbers from 0 to N. This time, let us try and compute the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.  sum = 0 for number in range 1,101 : sum = sum + number print sum   We used the variable sum to accumulate the sum of the numbers through the loop. Notice that we initialized the variable to 0 before entering the loop. Otherwise, Python would not know which variable we are referring to and if we were to declare sum = 0 inside the scope of the for loop, then we would effectively set sum to zero after each iteration. That would not work either.  We also used range   with two arguments, what is that about? Well, the first argument is the number from which we start counting, the second is the number up until which we will count and I will even tell you a secret – there is a third possible argument for range. The third argument is specifying the increment to increase our iterable  it is 1 by default .  Notice also, that in order to sum the numbers from 1 to 100 – I had to call range  1,101  that is, because when the iterator reaches the final value – 101, we exit the for loop.  myInput = input "Enter numbers from 0 to 100\n" .split   result = [] for x in myInput: if float x   =0:  result.append float x  100   print result   In this example we take the numbers that the user inputs and of those that are between 0-100 we add them to a new list compressed in the range of 0-1. Notice that we need to cast the iterator, since by default anything that reads user input is a string. Notice that the if statement is applied to each item in the list.   even = [] odd = [] for x in range 101 : if x%2==0:  even.append x   else:  odd.append x   print even  print odd   Here we take the numbers from 0-100 and split them into two lists – those of  the  even  numbers,  and  those  of  the  odd  ones.    Take  note  of  the  use  of indentation to specify which statement belongs to which code block.  While Loops  While loops are a more general category of loops.      The  rhomboid  specifies  a  conditional  expression.  In  for  loops  our conditional  expression  was  –  Have  we  reached  the  last  item  of  the  iterable object? With while loops it can be any expression.  Since  it  is  a  more  general  expression  it  means  that  we  can  imitate  the  logical flow of a for expression.  x = 0 while x < 11:   print x  x = x + 1  Instead of using the range function, we just imitated its logic by creating our own variable x, told Python we want to execute the statement within the while  scope  until  x  is  101  or  larger  and  in  effect  –  we  achieved  the  same result. This also allows us to create a logical flow that cannot be done with a for loop.  Consider we want to create a program that reads random numbers until a specific number is read. We cannot do this with a for loop, because we just do not know how many iterations it will take us for this number to come up, however if we are to use a while expression it is extremely intuitive.  from random import randrange  desiredNumber = 42 numberOfCycles = 0 x = randrange 100   while x != desiredNumber: x = randrange 100  numberOfCycles = numberOfCycles + 1  print "We found our number in " + str numberOfCycles  + " iterations!"   Here we  use a  function from  the  ‘random’  library  called  randrange  – which generates a random number in the specified range – in our case from 0-100. We do not know ahead of time how many times the loop should be executed which should indicate to you that a while loop is necessary.  You may have noticed however that if our desired number is outside the range  in  which  we  generate  numbers   say  we  wanted  the  number  200   we would never exit the while loop, and this would freeze our entire program. This is why, even though while loops are more powerful, we use them only when  necessary,  because  they  can  cause  infinite  loops,  out  of  bounds   exceptions, etc. These issues are handled by design in for loops.  x = int input "Enter a number:\n"   print x  while x != 1: if x%2 == 0: x = x  2  else:  x = 3*x + 1 print x, end=" "  print x   This  example  is  a  famous  unsolved  mathematical  problem  called  the Collatz Conjecture, solving it will earn you 1,000,000 USD you can look up Wikipedia  for  more  information  on  the  problem,  simply  put  we  enter  a number and apply the following function to it: if x is even, we divide it by two, if x is odd, we multiply it by 3 and add 1.  Now the question that the conjecture tries to answer is – do we always reach 1 in the end? Now this is yet to be proven hence why it’s an unsolved problem,  but  for  all  practical  purposes  we  can  consider  it  to  be  true,  since computers have verified it does reach one, up to very large initial numbers, however if it turns out to be false then that would mean that there is some number which when entered will not produce 1 at the end, meaning our while loop will be infinite, which again goes to show how dangerous while loops can be.  meals = [] userInput = input "Enter a meal you enjoy  ‘done’ to quit \n"  while userInput != 'done': meals.append userInput  userInput = input "Enter a meal you enjoy  ‘done’ to quit \n"  print meals   Here is an example of how you can prompt the user to input a varying number of entries. If, however you mess up the conditional expression you can leave the user frustratedly inputting in an infinite loop.   This infinite loop is a gracious one, it doesn’t overload your processor, since  the  program  stops  after  each  iteration  and  waits  for  users  input.  If, however,  you  wouldn’t  wait  for  user  input  and  execute  heavy  computation tasks  like loading files, searching through big lists, etc. , the python process would quickly overload itself and potentially freeze.  meals = [] userInput = input "Enter a meal you enjoy done to quit \n"  while userInput == userInput: meals.append userInput  userInput = input "Enter a meal you enjoy done to quit \n"  print meals   This infinite loop is a gracious one, it doesn’t overload your processor, since  the  program  stops  after  each  iteration  and  waits  for  users  input.  If, however,  you  wouldn’t  wait  for  user  input  and  execute  heavy  computation tasks  like loading files, searching through big lists, etc. , the python process would quickly overload itself and potentially freeze. Try this two-liner:  while True: print 2    Programming Functions Introduction  A function is a reusable block of code that encapsulates a single related action. The purpose behind this is to organize the code into modules each of which handles a specific part of the overall programs’ logic so it can be easily reused, improved and managed.     In  this  introduction,  we  have  already  used  various  different  built-in functions, now we are finally ready to create some of our own. All functions begin with the keyword ‘def’ followed by the function name and parentheses, ending with a colon to indicate the code block for the function – similarly to conditional expressions and loops.  def myFunction  : print "Hi, I'm the function you were looking for!"   for x in range 10 : myFunction    In this simple example, we have a function that just prints out some text and we call it just like we called the built-in functions, but this time from a loop – which results in the function being called 10 times. Now this is not a very sensible function since we can just type in the print statement inside the for loop and not bother with functions at all, so let us correct this mistake and move forward with a better example.   def compute100sum  : sum = 0 for x in range 101 : sum = sum + x  print sum   userIn = input "Would you like to compute the sum of the first 100 numbers? y n\n"  if userIn == 'y': compute100sum   else: userIn = input "Last chance to compute the sum, do you want to? y n\n"  if userIn == 'y':  compute100sum   print "You almost missed out on a great opportunity"   else:  print "I guess you will never know"   In this example as you can see, we call the function at two different points in  the  program.  We  could  still  just  write  the  code  instead  of  the  function name at the two points where we called it, however I encourage you to try and do it, so you can see for yourself how much messier the code gets, and this is only a small introductory example.  Imagine a function, long hundreds of rows, being called from 10 different places.  Now  replacing  that  function  call  with  its’  contents  would  be  a  real disaster. It would also be very redundant – as you would have 10 times the exact same code inside your source code.     By outsourcing these repeating code lines into function, you  -          reduce the file size, -          remove redundancy and -          enhance the readability and maintainability of the code.  The use of functions to create modularity in your programs is not strictly a technical skill – it is more of a design skill, since you are not changing the overall  performance  of  your  code,  but  some  of  its  meta-characteristics  like readability, reusability, scalability etc.   If  this  seems  somewhat  pointless  and or  subjective,  worry  not,  as  it becomes more and more useful the further down the coding journey you go. As projects get more complex and your programming intuition gets stronger you are going to start to incorporate functions intuitively into your code.  For now, when writing a program, remember to ask yourself – will these statements always come together, and will I need them more than once  in my code? If the answer is yes, you should consider outsourcing them into a function.  Parameters of a function  We already have some practical experience with function parameters, for instance every time we did user inputs, we specified a message to the user passed as a parameter to the ‘input’ function. We also passed parameters to the ‘range’ function, passed objects to the ‘type’ function etc.  Parameters are an important feature, because they allow us to create more responsive  functions,  because  having  parameters  allows  our  function  to change its’ behavior based upon the parameters given. Here is the following scenario  –  we  want  to  make  a  quiz  program  so  we  can  compete  with  our friends.  def askQuestions myDictionary, challenger : print challenger," do your best to answer the following questions:\n"  count = 0 for question in myDictionary:  ans = input question  if ans == myDictionary[question]:  count = count + 1 print "Correct answer!\n"   else:  print "Wrong answer!\n"   print challenger," you got ",count," questions correct!\n"   myDict = { '2 + 2 = ?\n':'4', '3 * 3 = ?\n':'9',   'What is the capitol of Germany?\n':'Berlin', "What's the integral of x^2 over 0 to 1?\n":'1' }  space:\n' .split    for cont in contestants: askQuestions myDict,cont      contestants  =  input 'Please  enter  the  names  of  the  contestants  separated  with  a  Hopefully,  it  becomes  evident  how  using  a  function  in  this  scenario makes the code much more readable and easier to use change. Obviously, we can  just  copy  the  initialization  and  the  loop  through  the  contestants  in  the askQuestions function to achieve the same result, however take a moment to appreciate how intuitively the logical flow of the program is. We initialize the questions  and  ask  the  user  to  enter  the  contestants,  after  which,  each contestant gets quizzed and his score displayed.  The askQuestions  function  does  exactly  what  it  says  –  it  asks  you  the questions. After some time, I might decide I want to add a different function that asks selects a subset of questions from a larger set, I might decide I want to  give  each  player  an  overall  score  and  give  stronger  players,  harder questions etc. Eventually the program can become quite complex, at which point it is really useful for you as a programmer to be able to know what a function does what without having to read all of the code inside the function.  I can see that the function takes in a question set and a challenger name and implements all of the question-asking functionality inside, therefore if I want to make a change to the way the questions are asked, I know I need to modify  this  function,  if  I  need  to  do  something  else,  I  can  rely  on  this function  doing  exactly  what  it  says  and  not  worry  that  it  might  have  some unforeseen impact on the code I am worrying about.  Return value of a function   We  talked  about  what  a  function  is,  how  we  can  alter  a  functions’ behavior by using parameters, it is only logical to consider the final piece of the puzzle – that is how can functions give us feedback. You guessed it! We do that by using the return statement.  Imagine the following scenario – our friend group is nerdy and somewhat forgetful and thus when we get together to play DnD we often forget our dies. Since you are an awesome programmer you decide to create a backup next time this happens.  from random import randrange  def ThrowDie character, numberOfSides : if numberOfSides == 20:  return randrange 20 +1  elif numberOfSides == 6: return randrange 6 +1 elif numberOfSides == 4: return randrange 4 +1  else:  print "Such a die does not exist!"   FrodosDie = ThrowDie 'Frodo', 6  print 'Frodo threw a ', FrodosDie   Not  only  functions  can  encapsulate  certain  functionality,  but  they  can communicate the result of the functionality with other parts of the code. If we decide  that  we  want  to  expand  our  program  I  can  just  use  the  ThrowDie function  inside  another  function  that  calculates  the  amount  of  damage  our character is going to inflict, for example.  If you consider our previous example with the quizzing program – now that  we  know  what  return  statements  do,  we  can  opt  to  return  the  score  of each  player  and  save  it  to  create  a  leaderboard  or  to  create  some  other functionality.  Docstrings   Going back to our discussion about functions serving as a design tool – Docstrings facilitate this further, by allowing us to document the behavior of our functions in a way that can be itself – functionally invoked.  Allow me to explain. Obviously, it is a good idea to give descriptions of your functions so whoever reads them or needs to edit them later can figure what  were  you  trying  to  do  with  this  code.  Docstrings  are  a  little  bit  more different  than  simple  comments,  because  there  is  a  method  that  allows programs  to  read  the  documentation  of  certain  functions  –  the  docstring  is that documentation.  def square x : '''square function takes in a single argument and returns its square ''' return x ** 2  print square.__doc__   So docstrings are created by using triple quotes or triple double-quotes, and can be invoked by using the ‘__doc__’ method, you might be wondering what those fancy underscores are, but worry not, we are going to cover that in the upcoming Object-Oriented Programming chapter.  Code  is  written  once,  but  it  is  read  and  edited  many  times,  this  is  why detailed  explanations  of  functions  are  a  key  skill  that  any  esteemed programmer should have. Even the creators of Python decided that it would be for the best if their code is well documented so, you can try and call the __doc__ method on all the built-in functions that you would like.  print print.__doc__   Type Checking  As we discussed in the first chapter – unlike most languages, Python is a dynamically  typed  language  and  it  does  not  require  the  programmer  to   specify the type of the variable he is using. Not only that, but a variable can change it’s type during the execution of the program, which may introduce issues when handling the variable.  def greeter_func name: str  -> None: print "Hi,",name   greeter_func "George"   The way this function works would be exactly the same if we did not use type  checking,  that  is  to  say  –  type  checking  falls  in  a  similar  category  to docstrings in that it provides us with a more readable code, which makes it less  likely  that  the  programmer  will  make  wrong  assumptions,  about  some variable or function in the code.  In the example we define a function that takes in a single parameter – our name and just prints it out. ‘name’ is our function parameter and colon ‘str’ indicates that we are expecting ‘name’ to be of type ‘str’. Similarly, the arrow followed by ‘None’ is the syntax for type checking the return value of our function,  so  in  this  example  what  we  are  telling  Python  is  that  we  are expecting the function to not have a return value. Let us do another example.  def addIntegers x: int, y: int  -> int: return x+y  print addIntegers "I'm feeling"," mischeavous"    You  will  notice  that  even  though  I  specified  that  ‘x’  and  ‘y’  should  be integers and that the return value should be also an integer – neither of those are actually true. Which highlights the fact that type checking serves a design purpose.  If you want to you can violate the types, but then you will be faced with the  possibility  of  your  code  producing  unforeseen  results,  but  you  wont  be   prevented  from  doing  so.  In  this  case  we  are  clearly  stating  that  we  would like to add together integers, however when we pass in two strings – what actually happens is we concatenate them.  Note that we can actually make Python ‘enforce’ typings – that is throw an  error  for  every  violated  type,  thus  allowing  only  programs  that  have successfully  passed  type-checking  to  be  executed,  this  however  will  be discussed at a later chapter, when we get into the subject of Python scripts.  Recursive functions  Remember  how  I  told  you  how  functions  are  more  of  a  design  thing  –  well I lied. That is mostly true, with the exception of recursive functions.       A  recursive  function  is  a  function  that  calls  itself.  That  might  sound crazy, since a deterministic function should always produce the same results, so wouldn’t having a function call itself result in an infinite loop? Well, you are almost correct, remember when we talked about parameters and how they can modify the behavior of the function? Yeah, that is how we will force the function to end.      Just  like  with  while  loops  we  run  the  danger  of  running  into  infinite loops,  as  there  is  always  the  possibility  for  a  function  to  call  itself  for eternity. This is why the first thing you must consider is the base case – what is  the  condition  upon  which  a  function  will  stop  calling  itself.  Here  is  an example – we want to calculate the factorial of a number – the product of all positive numbers leading up to it. If you are still not sure what it is, remember that the top skill of a programmer is – being able to find the correct answers on the internet.   def factorial x : ''' Takes in a single argument x and returns it\'s factorial, which is the product of all numbers from 1 to X ''' if x == 1:  return 1  else:  return factorial x-1 *x  x = int input "Enter a number less than 10\n"   print "The factorial of", x, "is",factorial x    Let  us  first  think  about  the  logical  flow  of  the  function.  The  entire function is a conditional expression, therefore there are two possibilities, one of which is to call the function again  but with a different parameter  and the other is to return the fixed value of 1.  Notice that each time the function does a recursive call – the value of the parameter is reduced by one. If for instance you were to call the function with a  negative  initial  parameter  it  would  just  keep  on  decreasing  until  a  stack overflow is reached, because the base case will never be reached.  Let us assume that that is not the case, or better yet – modify the base case  to  be  lesser-than-or-equal  to  one  so  there  are  no  gaping  holes  in  our logic. Following this example – calling factorial 5  will result in 5 recursive calls to the factorial function. The base case is factorial 1  and that is what guarantees  our  function  will  end  successfully.  It  is  worth  noting  that  even though  it  looks  similar  to  a  loop  where  we  iterate  through  each  and  every element, there is a very important distinction. Namely – our first call to the function returns 5*f 4  which is not a value.  What actually happens is we go down the recursion and once we reach the  base  case,  we  start  going  back  up  substituting  the  function  call  for  the value we already know.  f 1  is substituted for 1, then f 2  is substituted for 2, f 3  is substituted for 6, f 4  is substituted for 24 and finally, since we now   know that f 4  = 24, we can calculate that f 5  = 5*f 4  is equal to 120.  This  may  seem  like  a  pointless  example,  because  you  can  achieve  the same thing with a simple for loop and you are correct, however the aim of the example  is  to  illustrate  the  concept  of  recursion  as  it  is  considered  a  more advanced topic. Later down the road when you start learning about graph and tree  structures  and  how  to  traverse  them,  recursion  will  become  an indispensable tool.   Object-Oriented Programming Introduction  We  spent  most  of  the  course  using  built-in  objects  and  we  even mentioned that everything in python is an object, but we dodged the question –  what  an  object  actually  is.  Now  we  are  finally  going  to  address  it  and combine all that we learned from previous chapters in a cohesive way into objects.  Object-Oriented  Programming   OOP   is  a  method  by  which  we  bundle  together related properties and actions in individual objects.  Consider  we  want  to  model  a  car  in  Python,  we  would  like  to  have  a name variable, a measure of how full is the gas tank and we would like to be able  to  drive  a  car.  All  of  these  things  are  inter-related  so,  just  like  with functions – it makes sense to couple them together from a design perspective.  Classes and Instances  The basis for OOP are Classes and Instances.  A class is the blueprint of an object, while the instance is the object itself.  The  blueprint  is  the  house  class  –  as  it  specifies  what  a  house  is  – something  having  a  roof,  walls,  a  door  etc.  Notice  how  the  class  does  not specify  exactly  what  is  a  house  –  it  only  tells  us  what  a  house  has.  House instances however are specific manifestations of a house. They all conform to the  class,  by  having  all  the  specified  properties,  but  each  house  can  be different to the next – one can have a red roof, while the other can have a blue roof.  class House: def __init__ self,roofColor,wallColor,doorDesign :   self.roofColor = roofColor self.wallColor = wallColor self.doorDesign = doorDesign  weirdHouse = House 'Blue','Gray','Classic'  fancyHouse = House 'Red','Gray','Modern'   print fancyHouse.roofColor   Let me just mention that functions within classes are called methods class  methods object methods etc.  Now  let  us  unpack  this.  The  class  is  initialized  by  using  the  ‘class’ keyword following with the class name. Inside the scope of the class, the first thing we see is this strange method with double underscores. Just like with the  __doc__  method  it  is  something  inherent  for  Python  and  is  used  to initialize a class.  ‘self’ is also a Python specific keyword – it is a reference to the instance of the class that is being invoked. So, when we say self.roofColor = ‘Red’, what we are telling Python is – I want the instance of the class being referred to,  to  have  the  property  ‘roofColor’  be  set  to  ‘Red’.  Back  to  the  example, what we are telling Python is, that in order to create a ‘House’ object we need to pass in 3 parameters each of which will be a specific property of the object.  The objects in this case are ‘weirdHouse’ and ‘fancyHouse’ and both of them have slightly different properties. We can easily check that, by using the  dot   operator.  Put  in  words,  what  it  stands  for  is  –  Access  this  specific variable method of this specific object.   Let us do another example.  class Car: def __init__ self, brand, model, percentFuel, yearProduced :  self.brand = brand self.model = model   self.percentFuel = percentFuel self.yearProduced = yearProduced  myVW = Car 'VW','Beetle',0.3,2010  myMazda = Car 'Mazda','323',1.0,2003       Just as before, we create the class by using the class keyword, then in the class body – we immediately define the __init__ function, so we can initialize our object variables. Outside of the function we create two instances of the class with those specific variables set to them.  Class Methods  So  far,  we  created  classes  that  hold  variables,  now  we  will  extend  that courtesy to functions, except – when they are in classes, we will call them methods.  class Car: def __init__ self, brand, model, percentFuel, yearProduced :  self.brand = brand self.model = model self.percentFuel = percentFuel self.yearProduced = yearProduced  def addFuel self, fuelToAdd :  if fuelToAdd + self.percentFuel > 1:   print "Warning danger of petrol spill!"  self.percentFuel = 1  self.percentFuel = self.percentFuel + fuelToAdd  def driveCar self :  if self.percentFuel > 0.1:  print "Brrrrrrm.."  self.percentFuel = self.percentFuel - 0.1  print "The",self.brand,self.model,"fails to start"   else:  else:  myVW = Car 'VW','Beetle',1,2010   myMazda = Car 'Mazda','323',0,2003   myVW.addFuel 1   myMazda.driveCar   myMazda.addFuel 0.5  myMazda.driveCar    Now we have added some functionality to our Car object. We can drive our  car  and  we  can  add  fuel  to  it.  The  logic  of  the  methods  is  pretty straightforward, so I am not going to go into detail about it. However, I will turn your attention to two facts – for every class method, the first parameter should  always  be  self,  this  tells  Python  that  what  we  are  dealing  with variables of the instance that called that specific method. For the same reason we call every object variable prefixed with self.  Dunder Methods  Dunder  is  a  contraction  of  Double  underscore,  sometimes  also  called magic methods. So far, we have used the __init__ method and the __doc__ method.  There  is  however  a  large  quantity  of  Dunder  methods,  so  for  the purposes of this introduction we are only going to look at a few.  When working with the default object types like int, string, float, etc. We have a lot of our functionality implemented for us. For instance, it is fairly obvious how adding two numbers works, however when we create our own   class - ‘Car’ and we decide on adding two instances of it - Volkswagen and a Mazda it is not very clear cut what that should do – that is why it is left to the programmer  to  decide  on  the  appropriate  meaning  for  the  respective operators,  you  might  read  about  this  exact  same  topic  referred  to  by  – operator overloading.  class Order: def __init__ self,cart,orderId :  self.cart = list cart  self.orderId = orderId  def __add__ self, other :  self.cart.append other  return self  for item in forgotToBuy: myOrder = myOrder + item  print myOrder.cart   myOrder = Order ['Orange','Pear','Banana'],101  forgotToBuy = ['Pizza','Fries','Chocolates']  In  this  example  we  are  creating  a  shopping  cart  class.  To  do  so  we initialize it as usual, using the __init__ method. In this case we also specify the  __add__  method  which  overloads  the  functionality  of  the  ‘+’  operator. Since Python has no way of knowing what we mean when we say add this to our shopping cart object – this is the way for us to tell it. When we say add this to my shopping cart, it makes sense to put it in the cart, so that is exactly what we do, our shopping cart is a list and we define adding things to the cart to be equivalent to appending the item to the list.  Notice  that  we  end  the  operator  overloading  with  the  statement  ‘return self’  that  is,  because  Python  expects  to  receive  an  object  of  the  same  type with which we initially started. As expected, the items we add in the cart end up appended in that list.  class Order:   def __init__ self,cart,orderId :  self.cart = list cart  self.orderId = orderId  def __add__ self, other :  self.cart.append other  return self  def __getitem__ self,key :  return self.cart[key]  for item in forgotToBuy: myOrder = myOrder + item  for i in range 4 : print myOrder[i]   myOrder = Order ['Orange','Pear','Banana'],101  forgotToBuy = ['Pizza','Fries','Chocolates']  Another example of a Dunder method is the __getitem__ method – which tells us what does it mean when we try to retrieve a value by index from our object. In this case it makes the most sense to return the I-th item from the cart.  Class Inheritance  Another fundamental concept of OOP is inheritance. It is most intuitively described as an is-a relationship. For example, a house is-a type of building, in this case the building is the parent class and the house is the child class. That is because all houses are buildings, but not all buildings are houses.  Class Inheritance  or Parent-Child Relationships  are especially common in  bigger  projects  and  frameworks   like  Django .  So  it’s  crucial  you understand it and try the following examples on your machine.  Vehicle is a parent class, it specifies things common to all vehicles, they use  some  sort  of  fuel,  are  used  for  driving,  etc.  Whilst  the  child  classes  of vehicle are types of vehicle who share all of the properties of being a vehicle,   but have other specific properties of theirs. For instance, a Bus vehicle has more than 10 seats and weights a lot more than cars or bikes and it requires a special  driver’s  permit.  Bikes  on  the  other  hand  reach  high  top  speeds,  are very fuel efficient and have only two tires.  Let us do an example to help illustrate the concept. Our parent class will  be ‘Warrior’ and our child classes would be ‘Ninja’ and ‘Knight’.  class Warrior: def __init__ self,weapon,style,origin :  self.weapon = weapon self.style = style self.origin = origin  def attack self :  print "*Generic attacking noises*"   def checkStatus self :  print "Warrior is ready to fight"   class Ninja Warrior : def __init__ self :  Warrior.__init__ self,'Katana','Agile','Japan'   def attack self :  print "The katana nimbly slashes through the air"   def specialAttack self :  print "Shuriken throw!"   class Knight Warrior : def __init__ self :  Warrior.__init__ self,['Broadsword','Shield'],'Endurance','Europe'   def attack self :  print "With a confident swing, the broadsword cuts through the air "   def specialAttack self :  print "Shield bash!"   myWarrior = Warrior 'Bow','Long-range','Steppes'  myNinja = Ninja   myKnight = Knight     myKnight.checkStatus   myKnight.specialAttack   myKnight.attack   print    myNinja.checkStatus   myNinja.attack   myNinja.specialAttack    print   myWarrior.checkStatus   myWarrior.attack    We start out in the same way, using the class specified followed by the class name, but when we define the child classes, we specify in parentheses who is the parent class that they inherit. What is the use of inheriting then? You will see that the Parent  Base  class has a function ‘checkStatus’ that is only implemented inside of it, however due to ‘Ninja’ and ‘Warrior’ being child classes of that class – they also can use that function.  Furthermore,  ‘attack’  is  implemented  in  the  Base  class,  but  each  of  the child classes have their own implementation of that method and when we call that method from the child classes, we get the result of their own function, not the generic one. This is what we call function overloading, as we have the same  function  multiple  times.  The  function  that  will  be  called  is  the  most specific function – the one that is in the child class.  There is also no problem with having specific method to each of the child  classes, like in this example – with the ‘specialAttack’ method.   Let’s find out what a web framework is. A web framework provides a set of tools that helps us in solving many of the common problems that occur in web development:  DJANGO 3  Why Django? Web Framework  -          URL routing  -          accessing database  -          manipulating data  -          security,  -          templates and much more.                 Suppose  you  were  to  create  a  web  application  from  scratch   in  any programming  language .  In  that  case,  you  will  face  the  problems  just mentioned and would have to solve them yourself – a very long journey. A framework can help solve these problems out of the box so you can focus on getting actual work done.    We use a web framework  or any programming framework for that  matter  not to reinvent the wheel.  Popularity of Django  Why Django? Because it is one of the best web frameworks Python has to offer.  It  has  an  active  community  and  countless  modules  on  the  python package  library.  It  means,  if  you  are  facing  a  problem,  someone  else  has likely  solved  it,  and  you  can  utilize  their  modules  to  speed  up  your development.         Figure 1 - Summary of the Django GitHub Repository  With  24k  forks   as  of  the  beginning  of  2021 ,  the  Django  Web Framework surpasses Laravel  a PHP Web Framework with 20k forks  and Ruby on Rails  Ruby Web Framework with 19k forks . This tells you that the users and community behind Django are gigantic. This, in turn, tells you, as already  mentioned,  that  a  lot  of  the  tasks  that  you  want  to  solve  probably already have been solved.    It is used by big corporations like Instagram, Disqus, Youtube, and many more. Django was built with the idea of developing web applications as fast as possible. It provides many useful features out of the box, such as a ready- to-use  authentication  system,  flash  messages,  password  reset,  and  much more.     Model  View  Controller  Model-View-Controller Pattern  Model-View-Controller  MVC  is a design pattern in which we separate the logic, data, and the UI into separate layers. It is a fancy way to say that we have  dissembled  our  Python  Code  in  different  files  depending  on  what  the code does.  This is the place where all of your data gets directly managed. Think of it as a blueprint for your data – but expressed in Code. With data usually being stored in a database.  Inside a Model you we tell your Application how to perform basic CRUD Operations on our data.  Reminder! CRUD = Create; Read; Update; Delete . The  Model  Layern  then  performs  the  final  operations  on  the  data  in  a Database.  This part of the pattern deals with displaying content and data to the user. HTML,  CSS,  Javascript  &  Static  Assets  are  defined  here.  For  example,  a productTemplate.html would belong to the View Layer.  The  controller  is  the  middleman  between  View  and  the  Model.  A Controller takes data from the model  which in turn speaks to the database , processes the data and passes it to the view.  Now  the  following  will  be  slightly  confusing:  Django  uses  a  design pattern that is very similar to the MVC - Model-View-Template  MVT . In simple terms,         The Model in MVT is the same as the MVC’s Model. The View in MVT acts as the Controller  business logic  in the  application.  The Template in MVT is the same as the MVC’s Template.   The  following  Figure  compares  the  MVC  and  MVT  while  also  highlighting the purposes of each Layer and the flow of Data.      Environment Setup  We  will  be  using  only  three  resources  that  are  free  and  partially  open source.  Python  3.8+  being  the  most  important  one.  While  the  Database  is secondary  since  you  can  choose  another  backend  for  your  Django Application – meaning you can choose to store your data in an SQLite file or another Database.              Python 3.8+ PostgreSQL Database Server pgAdmin 4  GUI for the DB Server   PostgreSQL on Windows  head   We will be using PostgreSQL as our database for this project. To install to  PostgreSQL,  https:  www.enterprisedb.com downloads postgres-postgresql- downloads, and download PostgreSQL for your OS. Since I’m using 64-bit Windows, I chose the “Windows x86-64” setup for the latest version, which at the time of writing is 13.1.     over   Figure 2 - Download Page for PostgreSQL Server   The setup process is pretty straightforward. You’ll be prompted to select in  a  directory  called installation  directory.   installing   it   an  I’m  “POSTGRESQL” on my C drive.    In the following step, you can select different components to install. We need  the  components  PostgreSQL  Server,  pgAdmin  4,  and  Command  Line Tools.  We  don’t  need  the  Stack  builder.  In  the  next  step,  leave  the  data directory  to  default,  a  directory  called  “data.”  You  will  be  asked  to  set  a password for the admin user of the database. Please remember the password, as we will need it later to connect to our database. For local development, a “12345” will be enough.        Figure 3 - It's crucial to remember this password  Next,  select  a  port  for  the  database.  Setting  it  to  default  “5432”  is recommended.  The  final  step  should  be  left  to  default  also.  If  you’re  on  a Mac, the steps described above are similar, and you have to leave everything to default. Just don’t install Stack Builder that comes bundled with this setup. Install the pgAdmin4 and everything else. Again, remember your password!  If this setup worked fine for you, skip the next section. If you run into  some troubles, give it a try with docker in the following chapter.     PostgreSQL on Linux  with Docker   It’s recommended to use Docker for several reasons. One of them is that your  host  machine  doesn’t  get  trashed  with  different  Services  and  Service versions.  Think  of  docker  for  PostgreSQL  as  virtualenv  is  for  python packages.  If  your  next  Django  Project  requires  an  older  version  of PostgreSQL, you can easily manage that with docker.    Assuming  that  you  have  docker  installed,  we’ll  briefly  touch  upon  PostgreSQL with Docker. First, pull the latest image.  Terminal  root@internetuser: home internetuser docker pull postgres        latest: Pulling from library postgres  Using default tag: latest  Now that we have pulled the latest Postgres Image let’s verify it.  root@internetuser: home internetuser docker images  Terminal  REPOSITORY      TAG             IMAGE ID                      CREATED                       SIZE    postgres        latest          a6cd86e1dfce                  11 days ago                   314MB  We need to launch the Image in a Container that will open ports 5432 to access the database from our local machine. Set the name of the Container to whatever you want.  Terminal              root@internetuser: home internetuser   docker   run   --name   finance_blog_db   -e  13b79ceceeebef0e33dedeffe5cb83f780f7f168cb74cd3a084ab634448c2599  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=finblogPW -d -p 5432:5432 postgres        root@internetuser: home internetuser docker container ls  CONTAINER ID    IMAGE           COMMAND                            CREATED                        STATUS                        PORTS                              NAMES   13b79ceceeeb    postgres        "docker-entrypoint.s…"   7 seconds ago                 Up 6 seconds                  0.0.0.0:5432->5432 tcp   finance_blog_db    The   “-e”   option   specifies   Variable “POSTGRES_PASSWORD”  inside  the  Container.  Postgres  will  create  an Admin user with the username “postgres” and the supplied password. You must use these credentials to log in to the database in PGAdmin4.     Environment   the   Important  Note:  This  Docker  Container  is  saving  all  the  data inside itself. Which means the data will be lost when the container fails  or  your  host  system  restarts.  While  not  ideal  for  production, It’s ideal for our purpose of learning about Django, since you can flush the database by restarting the container.     BASICS  Projects vs. Application Theory  You  will  see  the  terms  “project”  and  ”application”  repeatedly  in  this  book, so we need to clarify the difference between them. Long story short:  -          project = project  e.g., netflix.com, youtube.com  -                    application  =  service   e.g.,  blog.netflix.com,  stream.netflix.com,  billing.netflix.com, etc.      Project  A  project  is  a  complete  Django  Application  with  settings,  media, templates, configurations, etc. A project is the most significant unit in terms of  file  structures.  You  can  zip  a  Django  project  folder,  and  it  will  contain every  source  code  and  functionality  that  your  Application  has.  The  data won’t be included as it resides in the Database.  Django projects must have one or more application s  – which is the next smaller  unit  in  our  Application  representation.  For  example,  your  Web Application  is  a  project.  It  will  have  different  functionalities   applications  like blogposts, user authentication, comment section, portfolio management, etc.  Application  Inside  a  project,  you  typically  have  a  couple  of  applications.  Each application has one or many functionalities, and they may be reused in other projects as well. A Django Application is a group of   -          Views – think code with business logic -          Models – think code that describes your data -          Templates – think HTML Layouts that your users interact with -          URLs – think URL-router for your Django Website  An  empty  Application   boilerplate   in  Django  has  the  following  folder  structure. We’ll take a closer look at each file in the following chapters.  Terminal    $: ls application_name  total 40 -rw-r--r--  1 a.bulezyuk  0B   __init__.py -rw-r--r--  1 a.bulezyuk  63B  admin.py -rw-r--r--  1 a.bulezyuk  83B  apps.py drwxr-xr-x  3 a.bulezyuk  96B  migrations -rw-r--r--  1 a.bulezyuk  57B  models.py -rw-r--r--  1 a.bulezyuk  60B  tests.py -rw-r--r--  1 a.bulezyuk  63B  views.py   Remember: You create a new project when you start working on a completely new website. You create a new application inside a Django project, when you are adding a new set of functionalities.  Before we take a closer look at the files in the terminal, let’s set up your development  environment  and  create  a  boilerplate  Django  Application  on your local machine.    Practice  Virtual Environment  It is preferred to use a virtual environment to isolate our Python 3 projects to  use  different  versions  of  the  same  package  for  different  projects.  By default, you can only have one version of a package installed at a time in a Python environment.  We’ll  make  use  of  virtualenv  –  but  feel  free  to  explore  pipenv  and pyenv.  Create  a  directory  called  “MyProject”  and  cd  into  it.  Open  your command prompt or terminal and run the following to install virtual env:  Terminal  E:\MyProject> pip install virtualenv      E:\MyProject> virtualenv .  This command will create two directories in MyProject, Lib, and Scripts. Any  packages  you  install  in  the  virtualenv  will  now  be  saved  to  the  site- packages directory found inside the Lib folder. Before we install anything, let’s activate the virtual env.  Change  directory  into  the  newly  created  Scripts directory  and  type  the   following command to activate the virtual environment:  Terminal  E:\MyProject> cd Scripts         MyProject  E:\MyProject\Scripts>    E:\MyProject\Scripts> activate  If you successfully activated the virtual environment, you should see the name of the root directory  MyProject  before the path in the command line or terminal. Success! From now on, every python library we install will be available  only  in  this  virtual  environment  and  only  when  you  successfully activate it.  Many  of  us  face  a  common  issue  when  we  open  a  new  terminal  and forget  to  activate  the  current  virtual  environment.  You  end  up  with  many Errors telling you that you are missing many python packages.  Installing Django  Now cd back to the root directory “MyProject” and install Django 3.    MyProject  E:\MyProject> pip install django  Terminal       At  the  time  of  making  this,  I  installed  the  latest  Django  version,  which was 3.1.3. Once you have Django installed, run the following command to create a Django project:       MyProject  E:\MyProject> django-admin startproject financeblog  You  will  now  have  a  new  directory  called  financeblog,  and  it  should  have the following tree directory.  Terminal     These files are:  -          manage.py - A command-line utility through which you can interact with the Django project. We don’t ever edit this file. As a Django developer, you use this file daily  at least for smaller projects .  -                   finanaceblog  - This directory is the core of your Django project  with configuration files.  -                   finanaceblog __init__.py - An empty file that tells Python to treat  this file’s directory as a package.  -                    finanaceblog asgi.py - It  is  a  configuration  file  for  making  our  project run as an ASGI application.  -                   finanaceblog wsgi.py - It is a configuration file for making our  project run as a WSGI application.  -                   finanaceblog settings.py - It includes all the settings required for  our project.  -          finanaceblog urls.py - This file holds all of the URL patterns in the  application, and each URL pattern is mapped to a View.               Now  cd  into  the  main  “finanaceblog”  project  folder  and  run  the  following command to start the project:   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>python manage.py runserver  Terminal  Doing  so  will  start  a  development  server.  Django  comes  with  a lightweight  development  server  that  automatically  restarts  every  time  it detects any changes to the project's source code. Note that this applies only to development. In production, we will have to set up a separate server. Running the above command will output the following information to the command prompt terminal:          Terminal  Watching for file changes with StatReloader Performing system checks...

Your  project  may  not  work  properly  until  you  apply  the  migrations for app s : admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.  Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them. Django version 3.1.3, using settings 'financeblog.settings' Starting development server at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.  Now  open  your  web  browser  and  head  over  to  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 ,  and you will see the following screen     Figure 4 - Welcome Screen of a newly installed Django Project  That’s  it.  With  only  a  couple  of  Command-line  executions  and  zero codings,  we  have  launched  a  website.  But…with  no  functionalities.  And… with no Database connection. At least we now have a nice rocket.  Django Project Settings  Before  moving  further,  let’s  quickly  look  at  the  configurations  in  the “settings.py”  file  inside  the  project’s  “financeblog”  directory.  Django  has many settings in this file, but we will take a look at the most important ones:    1.           BASE_DIR: A constant  that  points  to  the  root  directory  of  your  project.  2.      DEBUG: This will be true by default. It tells Django that we are in development mode, and Django will show detailed error messages. This must be set to False when moving the website to production. Because  we  don’t  want  to  show  random  users  our  inner  debug messages for security reasons.  3.           ALLOWED_HOSTS: This is a list of domains that your Django site can serve. It needs to be configured in production when DEBUG   is set to False.  4.           INSTALLED_APPS: This includes a list of applications that have been enabled for this project. Simply adding applications or plugins to a Django project does not enable them. You must include them in this list.  5.      ROOT_URLCONF: Points to a file where your root URL patterns  are defined. We’ll cover this file later.  When deploying to production, you’ll use some sort of server. You will need  to  tell  your  WSGI  Application  where  the  settings  file  is  located.  You can  variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE. In our case, you would insert something like ‘financeblog.settings’.  environment   setting   this   the   do   by   You  can  also  use  settings  to  set  some  global  variables  that  every application needs access to. In the application, you can then check the value of a variable.  from django.conf import settings if settings.DEBUG:  Do something  Connecting to the Database Configuring PostgreSQL  We  now  have  a  working  Django  project  installed.  If  you  noticed  the terminal message, it says that we have 18 unapplied migrations. This message is telling us that we have some database changes that haven’t been saved yet. By default, Django comes with an SQLite database configuration, but we will be using PostgreSQL. Let’s configure our database first.  Open pgAdmin 4 that we previously installed. On your first time opening  the pgAdmin Client, you should see a “Set Master Password” Popup.     Figure 5 - Setting a master password for the pgAdmin UI Access  You have to set a master password. It will be used to access the pgAdmin 4  application  –  it’s  not  the  Database  password!  After  you  set  the  master password,  you’ll  be  prompted  to  log  in  as  the  ‘postgres’  user  when connecting to the server. Here you have to put the password you chose at the setup process – this is the Database password!  Now, try to access the initial Database. As you can see, we currently have a single database called “postgres”. We have to create a new database for our project.  We  will  choose  the  same  name  as  our  Django  project,  i.e., “financeblog”. Right-click on the “Databases” and select Create > Database.     Figure 6 - Dropdown Menu to create a new Database in pgAdmin  Doing so will open a new window. Type “financeblog” in the field next to  “Database”  and  hit  the  save  button.  This  setup  is  entirely  sufficient  for learning purposes.     Figure 7 - UI Mask to create a new Database in pgAdmin  You  will  now  have  your  database  listed  next  to  “postgres”  database.  It will not be activated and will have a red cross mark on it, as you can see. Right-click the “financeblog” database and select “connect database”.     Figure 8 - Empty PostgreSQL Database for Django Project  That’s it. Your database has been created and is up and running. It’s still  empty as we haven’t created any tables yet.  Configuring Django Connection  Now we have to connect our Django project to the database. By default, Django comes with a sqlite3 database configured – a Database that is stored as a file inside your project.   To use other databases, we have to configure the Django “settings.py”. We  will  also  need  a  python  package  called  “psycopg2”  which  acts  like  a driver between python and PostgreSQL.  Close the server on the command prompt and install psycopg2 via pip.  For Ubuntu Users: First, install libpq-dev by sudo apt-get install libpq-dev   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>pip install psycopg2   Terminal  After  installing  the  package,  open  the  “settings.py”  found  inside  your  “financeblog” directory. Scroll down to the DATABASES setting.        } }  } }  DATABASES = { 'default': {  'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME': BASE_DIR   'db.sqlite3',  Code 1 financeblog\financeblog\settings.py  like.  DATABASES = { 'default': {  'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2', 'NAME': 'financeblog', 'USER': 'postgres', 'PASSWORD': '12345', 'HOST': '127.0.0.1', 'PORT': '5432',  Code 2 financeblog\financeblog\settings.py  Here we have to make some changes. Edit  “DATABASES” dictionary   1.      ENGINE: We are telling Django to use PostgreSQL engine. It will  use psycopg2 for this. The value is the path to the package engine.  2.      NAME: The name of the database we created. 3.      USER: Name of the database user we will use to access the database.  It’s Postgres.  4.           PASSWORD: Password of the user postgres. I chose mine to be  12345 at install time. You have to put your password here.  5.      HOST: This tells Django the location of our database. It is localhost. 6.      PORT: This tells Django the port at which our database listens. The  default would be 5432 unless you changed it.  Django comes with a couple of built-in database backend.  Table 1: Built-in Database Engines     Database PostgreSQL MySQL SQlite Oracle  Django Engine Path django.db.backends.postgresql django.db.backends.mysql django.db.backends.sqlite3 django.db.backends.oracle  Django Database Migration  What is Migration?  Migration is a way of propagating changes made to data structure  saved in models.py  into your database schema. Think of migration as git for the database schema.  In Django, you declare your Data Models  models = think SQL Tables  in models.py. In models.py, you also define their attributes  model attributes = think Columns of a SQL Table .   Your Data Models will grow and change over time – you add a column A, you change the maximum length of column B, and you delete column C. Each  time  you  perform  these  changes  in  your  model.py,  you  have  to propagate these changes to the Database  PostgreSQL in our case  – Django migrations are here to do this task.     Figure 9 - Translation of Data Model in models.py into actual DB Changes  The  workflow  of  a  Django  migration  is  rather  simple,  as  shown  in  the  Figure before:    1.  2.   Create Migration s  Apply Migration s   Create Migrations  To  package  up  your  model.py  changes  into  migration  files   migration file  =  think  git commit   use  the  makemigration  command.  This  command will  generate  the  mentioned  migration  files.  The  migration  files  for  each Application  will  be  saved  in  the  “migrations”  directory  inside  that Application directory.   Terminal   My Project : python manage.py makemigrations  Apply Migrations  When you create a new Django Project, the initial migrations are already made  for  you.  That’s  why  we  can  omit  the  previously  mentioned makemigrations  command.  We  proceed  with  the  second  command  in  the workflow  -  migrate.  This  command  will  read  the  previously  generated migration files, translate them into SQL and update the Database Schema.    Operations to perform:   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>python manage.py migrate  Terminal  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions  Running migrations:  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial...

OK  head   Now   to  financeblog>Schemas>public>Tables.    back   pgAdmin   and   open   Figure 10 - Django 3 Core Tables saved in PostgreSQL Database.  You can see now that our financeblog database has 10 tables. This means our Django database connection configuration was successful. Now rerun the dev server. You shouldn’t see the “unapplied migrations'' message anymore – that message was displayed at the first start of the dev server.

Creating a new Application manage.py startapp  Let’s create our first Django Application. Remember, an Application in Django is similar to service for your websites like a blog service, a billing service or a booking service. Django provides a command utility that builds the boilerplate structure for us. Go to the root directory of your project and run the following command to create an app called “blog”.      MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>python manage.py startapp blog  Terminal  This command will bootstrap a new App inside our Django Project. The CLI   Comman  Line  Interface   will  create  pre-populated  python  files  inside that folder. Pretty handy.      Figure 11 - Folder Structure of a newly created Django 3 Application      1.   2.  3.   4.   5.   6.      admin.py: You include your models in this file if you want to show them on Django’s administration site. We’ll cover it in the following sections. Using this file is optional.  apps.py: We can configure our app’s behaviour in this file. models.py:  We  define  our  application’s  data  models  here. This  file  is  required,  but  we  can  leave  it  blank  if  we  aren’t doing anything related to databases.  tests.py:  Here,  Django  will  look  for  tests  for  the  current  is   the   views.py:  This   file  where  you  write  your business application  logic.  Each  view  works  with  an  HTTP request as its parameter and returns some sort of response.  migrations :  This   include  any  database migrations we create. That’s the folder we talked about in the previous sections.  folder  will   app.  Whenever we create a new application in a Django project, we have to explicitly tell Django that we will be using this application. To do so, open the “settings.py” file in the “financeblog” directory and scroll down to this section:  INSTALLED_APPS = [ 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', ]  Code 3 financeblog\financeblog\settings.py  In this list, add our newly created application like so:   INSTALLED_APPS = [ 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'blog' ]  Code 4 financeblog\financeblog\settings.py   Designing the Blog Schema  Defining the attributes  We use models  from “Data Model”  to define schemas. In Django, we create our models inside the “models.py” file of every application. A Django model is a python class that inherits from “django.db.models.Model”.   Django  will  create  a  table  in  the  Database  for  each  model  found  inside our models file. The attributes of our model class will represent the columns inside the database table. With the class attributes, we specify the type of data a column will have.  Let’s  define  a  “Blog”  data  model  by  creating  a  Python  Class  with  the name  “Blog”.  Open  the  models.py  file  of  our  blog  application  and  add  the following code.  from django.db import models from django.utils import timezone from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.urls import reverse from django.core.validators import MinLengthValidator  content_validator = MinLengthValidator limit_value=300, message="Content should be at  least 300 characters long!"   class Blog models.Model :   title = models.CharField max_length=250  content = models.TextField validators=[content_validator]  date_published = models.DateTimeField default=timezone.now  author = models.ForeignKey User, on_delete=models.CASCADE   def __str__ self :  return self.title  def get_absolute_url self :  return reverse "blog_detail", kwargs={'pk': self.pk}   Code 5 financeblog\blog\models.py  Let’s take a look at the attributes we just wrote inside the “Blog” model. Remember,  these  class  attributes  will  create  columns  in  the  PostgreSQL Table “blog” when we make the migrations.    1.   2.   3.   4.   title: This field is for our blog title. It is a CharField that will  become a VARCHAR column inside our database.  content: This is the body of the blog. It is a TextField  that  will become a TEXT column in our database.  date_published: It is a DateTime value that indicates when the post was created. We are setting the option auto_now_add to  True,  which  indicates  that  it  will  automatically  set  the current date whenever an object is created.   author:  A  ForeignKey  field  in  Django  means  a  Many-To- One field. It will define a many-to-one relationship between a blog object row and a user object row. It means a user creates a blog,  and  a  user  can  create  many  blogs.  In  our  database,  the primary  key   primary  key  =  pk;  think  id   of  the  related  User will  be  saved  to  this  field.  The  on_delete=models.CASCADE option means that if the associated User is deleted, we want to delete this blog.  Note  that  we  didn’t  create  this  User  model.  Django  gives  us  an authentication system out of the box, which has a User model. We are importing the User model in the third line.   The  __str__  method  is  used  to  create  a  human-readable  version  of  the object. We are returning the title of the blog. Whenever we print an instance of the blog or view it on the admin site  discussed in the following sections , Django will display the blog title instead of something unreadable  like the Python Object itself .  Following  is  an  overview  of  other  field  Types  that  Django  provides  us with.  You  can  use  any  of  these  field  types  from  the  table  by  creating instances of the mentioned classes like:  field_name = models.  parameters   Some of them will be used later in this book. A full list of the available Fields was not shown since the list will grow and change with new versions. The most crucial aspect of this section is to understand that you define the fields in a model Class and have parameters and options.    Field  Class  Description and Parameters  New in Django 3.1. A Field for saving JSON Payloads.  Incredibly convenient when working with REST APIs.  Parameters:  JSONField  -          encoder: simple JSON Class to serialize data -          decoder: simple JSON Class to deserialize a        value fetched from DB  Example: data = models.JSONField null=True      Parameters:  directory  -          upload_to: Path in your project to the upload  FileField  -          storage: A Storage object that handles the  retrieval and storage of your files   Example: attachment_one = models.FileField upload_to='uploads '   ImageField     Similar to FileField but with a Validator to ensure the  File is an Image.  Example: models.ImageField default="default.jpg", upload_to="profile_pictures"   EmailField is basically a CharField with an  EmailValidator  EmailField  Example: Email = models.EmailField max_length=50            Applying Migrations  Remember,  our  Blog  model  represents  a  table  in  the  database.  The attributes  of  the  model  represent  columns  in  the  database  table.  Django doesn’t  automatically  create  the  tables  for  our  models.  We  have  to  tell Django  to  do  that  explicitly.  There  are  two  steps  involved  to  push  our model’s schema to reflect on the database.  The first step is creating a migration. Migration is a file that will be used to push the model schema changes to the database. The next step is running a command called migrate, which will push the model changes to the database using the migrations file and keep both of them in sync. We’ve discussed this already. So let’s do this now for our model – Blog.  This two-step of saving the schema to the database might seem confusing, but  it  is  helpful.  Our  database  might  change  over  time,  i.e.,  adding  a  new model, creating some new field, or altering an existing field. The migrations help keep track of these changes, so our database and models are always in sync. Let’s create the migration for the model we just created by running the following command.    MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>>python manage.py makemigrations  Terminal    Migrations for 'blog':  blog\migrations\0001_initial.py     - Create model Blog  You should see a file “0001_initial.py” inside the “migrations” folder of the  blog  application.  This  file  will  be  used  to  create  the  schema  in  our database when we run the following command. Let’s push these changes to the database schema by running the “migrate” command.  Terminal    Operations to perform:   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>>python manage.py migrate  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, blog, contenttypes, sessions  Running migrations:   Applying blog.0001_initial... OK  Now that we ran the “migrate” command, our database schema and our models  are  in  sync.  Just  note  that  every  time  you  change  your  Model attributes or create a new model, you must first run the “makemigrations” command, which will allow Django to keep track of the changes. Afterward, you run the “migrate” command to make sure your models and database are in sync  Admin UI Site for the project Management  Django gives us an admin site out of the box that allows us to manage content very quickly. We can create, update and delete model instances in the admin site. The admin site is dynamically generated for a model by reading the  model  data.  We  have  to  use  it  to  register  the  model  we  want  to  be available  on  our  admin  site.  This  is  also  an  application,  and  Django the  “INSTALLED_APPS”  setting  in  the automatically  added  “settings.py” file.  to   it    Let’s  register  our  “Blog”  model  with  the  admin  site.  Open  the  “admin.py” file inside the “blog” application and add the following code:  from django.contrib import admin from .models import Blog  admin.site.register Blog   Code 6 financeblog\blog\admin.py  We have registered our “Blog” model with the admin site, and it should now be available on the admin site – more on that in the next sections. When your application grows in size, meaning you create many models, it makes sense to pass the model in a list to admin.site.register  . You can go a step further and create a method that will extract all models from models.py inside the application and pass them to …register  .    Creating a superuser  To  access  the  admin  site,  we  need  a  superuser  with  admin  privileges.  Create a superuser by running the “createsuperuser” command like so:   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>python manage.py createsuperuser  Terminal    Username  leave blank to use 'Andrey' : root  Email address: root@gmail.com Password: Password  again :  Superuser created successfully.  Enter your username, email, and password to create the superuser. Now  let’s access the admin site.  Django Admin Site   Run the development server and go to http:  localhost:8000 admin:     Figure 12 - Blank Django Admin Login Interface  Use the username and password of the user you created earlier to login.  You should now see the home page of the Admin site.    Figure 13 - Home Page of a logged in Admin in the Admin UI  You can see models called “Groups'' and “Users”. They are shipped with application  authentication   the  Django   part   and   of   Django     django.contrib.auth .Django  registers  these  two  automatically  with  the admin  site.  You  can  view  existing  users  by  clicking  on  “Users”,  add  new users or delete existing users, though currently, only one user exists. We will not  be  concerned  with  the  “Groups”  model  in  this  book.  Groups  are generally used to assign permissions or labels to individual users.  Below these two models, we can see our Blog model. It shows up here because we registered it earlier with the admin site. Let’s create a new blog entry.  Click  the  “Add” button next to Blogs.  You  will  see  that  the  Django admin has automatically generated a form for this model:    Figure 14 - An input Form for every added and migrated Model  This is great as it gives us a quick and user-friendly way to create, update or delete model instances. If you have ever tried to create an Admin UI  and forms  for your projects, you know how much work and frustration Django liberates you from. Fill the form and save the blog. You should be redirected to a listing page with a success message.     Figure 15 - Overview of Model Entries  table rows  in Admin UI  Now experiment with the admin site by adding a few more blogs or users,  updating some blogs, or deleting a few of them.    Djangos ORM - Django Shell Theory  Django  gives  us  a  database-abstraction  API  that  lets  us  create,  update, delete and retrieve objects – the so-called CRUD Operations. This API will take care of writing SQL Queries under the hood. At the same time, we can easily use function calls to perform actions on the database.  This allows every python developer to perform complex CRUD Tasks on  a SQL Database without having any experience with SQL.  Practice   Let’s take a quick look at the Django Shell. You can think of this shell as a stripped-down version of your Django website. It boots into your Django Project, loads your settings and apps. From there on, you can manage your Project,  load  models,  manipulate  the  Database,  and  so  on.  We’ll  focus  on CRUD  Operations  for  models.  Close  the  server  and  write  the  command “manage.py shell” to enter the python shell in the context of our project:   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>python manage.py shell  Terminal     Creating objects  Now enter the following code:  from blog.models import Blog from django.contrib.auth.models import User user = User.objects.get username="root"  blog = Blog title="Test Blog", content="A test blog...", author=user  blog.save    Let’s take a look at the code in detail. At the top, we are importing our  Blog model and Django’s default User model.  user = User.objects.get username="root"   In this line, we are using the “get” method, which returns a single object from  the  database.  If  no  objects  are  found  matching  the  query,  then  it  will raise  a  DoesNotExist  Exception.  Also,  note  that  the  get  method  expects  a single object from the database. If your query returns more than one object, it will raise a MultipleObjectsReturned Exception.  blog = Blog title="Test Blog", content="A test blog...", author=user    In this line, we are creating a new Blog instance by passing named values in  the  model.  We  are  not  passing  in  the  “date_published”  value  as  it  gets added  automatically  upon  the  creation  of  the  object  –  re-read  the auto_add_now=True part. Note that this blog instance has only been created in memory – if you check the Database at this stage, you won’t see the new entry.  blog.save    This is the line that will actually save the blog instance to our database. It used the INSERT SQL statement to save a new record. To directly save to the database, we can use the create method:  Blog.objects.create title="Hello world", content="Some blog content...", author=user   Let’s  change  the  Blog  object  we  created  that  is  stored  in  our  blog  Updating objects  variable:  blog.title = "Updated blog title" blog.save    We changed the title of the blog and called the save method. This time it checks whether that record already exists and changes only a part of it. It will perform UPDATE.    Retrieving objects  Django returns objects from a database in the form of QuerySet Object. A QuerySet is a collection of objects returned from a database. It offers many filters to limit the results further.  A  QuerySet  Object  is  the  equivalent  of  the  “SELECT''  SQL   statement.  Whereas  the  filters-methods  are  the  limiting  clauses  such  as  WHERE, ORDER BY, etc..  We  can  get  a  QuerySet  by  calling  a  filter  method  on  our  model’s  Manager, “objects''. To retrieve all objects, we can use the “all” method.  Blog.objects.all    with “Test”.  ➢         ,  ,  ]>  We  can  retrieve  objects  based  on  a  filter.  Let’s  retrieve  blogs  that  start  Blog.objects.filter title__startswith="Test"   ➢        ]>  Let’s take a look at the commonly used QuerySet filters before moving to the  next  section.  Be  aware  that  the  following  table  is  just  a  subset  of  all filters.  A  more  complex  filter  should  be  researched  in  the  official documentation based on your current Django Installation. The following can be read and executing with the following simple syntax:  from .models import model_name obj_or_queryset = model_name.obejcts.     Table 2: QuerySet Methods and Filters     Method name  filter    order_by    Description Returns matching Objects based on  Field Lookups.  Returns matching Objects ordered  based on Models Meta-Class or provided field name as parameter.  Returns  QuerySet  QuerySet   get_or_create    all    get    create    count    latest    first    last    delete    Basically, it returns a copy of the  QuerySet you invocating the method on.  Returns a single Object based on given Field Lookups and parameters.  Creates and returns the newly created  Object.  Tries to fetch a single object based on  given Field Lookups and Parameters. If None were found, the Object would be created filled with data that you passed as search criteria.  Counts all the objects based on the  searching criteria and returns an integer. Similar to “COUNT  ” SQL Statement.  Returns the latest Object from a  QuerySet, based on fields provided as parameters.  Returns the first Object from a  QuerySet. The equivalent of fetching the 0th index from a list.  Returns the last Object from a  QuerySet. The equivalent of fetching the n-1th index from a list.  QuerySet  Model  Instance  Model  Instance  Model  Instance  Model  Instance  Model  Instance  Model  Instance  Model  Instance  Obj.  Deletes one Object or all Objects   deleted  from a QuerySet.  We have learned how to interact with the database and manage our data,  and now it is time to move on to creating views for our Blog application. Creating Views Theory   Django  View  is  a  class  or  a  method  that  receives  a  web  request  as  an argument  and  returns  a  web  response.  We  can  return  HTML  documents, JSON Payloads  think REST API , Images, XML etc. The Business Logic of Django App will reside in the view layer.  You can find many discussions online about where business logic code goes in Django. There many valid suggestions – like outsourcing them in so- called Services – but we will stick with the simplest solution.  Generally, you are free to name your views as you wish and assign them tasks that you deem necessary. But in Django, as is the case in many other web frameworks, you have a handful of Views considered “Standard,” which will cover most of your use cases.   Table 3: Django  Generic  View Types     View Name  =Django Class   DetailView  Description  Used to display detailed data of a model e.g.,  -          a User Profile -          single Transaction -          single Post  Displays a Form with necessary input fields to  CreateView  create a new model  e.g.,  -          User Registration -          sending Money -          publishing a Post  Displays a pre-filled Form with necessary input  fields to update an existing model  -          Update User Profile -          Update or Cancel a Transaction -          edit a Post  Used to handle model entry deletions. Used to display all or a subset of Entries of  a   UpdateView  e.g.,  DeleteView  ListView  model s . e.g.,  -          List a Users’ friends -          List of transaction in past 7 days -          List of Posts this month  Practice  We will now create a list view and a detailed view. One view will display a  list  of  all  the  blogs  in  our  database,  and  the  other  will  display  a  detailed page of one specific blog.   We will first write the logic of these two views, and then we will route them to URL patterns, so Django knows what URL is bound to what view. Lastly, we will create an HTML template that will be returned by our view  function   along  with  an  HTTP  response  to  show  the  data.  Open  the “views.py” file inside your blog application and write the following code.  from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404 from .models import Blog  def list_blogs request : blogs = Blog.objects.all   return render request, "blog list.html", {"blogs": blogs}   Code 7 - financeblog blog views.py  We’ve just created our first view. Our list_blogs view takes the request as  a  parameter.  Note  that all  views  require  a  request.  Afterwards,  we  are fetching all the blogs and storing them in a variable called blogs. Lastly, we are  returning  the  render  function.  The  render  function  takes  three parameters:  request,  a  path  to  our  HTML  template,  and  the  content dictionary.  Content Dictionary  The third parameter to the render function is a dictionary of variables we want to use in our template. In this case, we are passing our blogs under the essential blogs, and looking back at our Table with QuerySet filters, we see that blogs should now return a QuerySet  =think python list .  The render method is a shortcut function to return an HttpResponse, and some data and a template – the type of the returned document is HTML in this case.  Request Object  A request is an object that Django builds for you – it’s an HttpRequest   Class instance. Your job is to extract the data from the object needed for your business logic – your view method. Below you’ll find a couple of essential and often used attributes and methods of the HttpRequest object.  Table 4: Important HttpRequest Attributes and Methods     Attributes or  Method  Description  HttpRequest.scheme HttpReuqest.body  HttpRequest.method  HttpRequest.POST HttpRequest.GET  Returns a string with either ‘http’ or ‘https’ Returns the raw HTTP Body. Returns Request Method like ‘GET’ or  ‘POST’  Returns HTTP POST parameters Returns HTTP GET parameters  Creating Blog Detail View  Let’s add a detail view down below the list_blogs view:  def detail_blog request, pk : blog = get_object_or_404 Blog, pk=pk  return render request, "blog detail.html", {"blog": blog}   Code 8 - financeblog blog views.py  -          This view takes pk along with the required request parameter. The pk here means primary key, and it will be used to retrieve a single Blog record from the database.  -          The function called get_object_or_404, here we pass a model and a querying parameter to fetch a single record. If the function finds the record,  it  will  return  a  QuerySet.  Otherwise,  it  will  display  a  404- error page.  -                   Next, we are returning the render method with a path to our detail   template and passing the blog instance  to  the  template.  Let’s  hook our views with the URL patterns.  URL patterns Theory  When  a  user  requests  a  page  on  our  Django  website  through  a  URL, Django will go through a list of URL patterns in the project and stop at the one that matches the user's requested URL.  one   urls.py   The URL patterns are concatenated from all applications inside a project, with  – project_name project_name urls.py . In our case, this central urls.py file is located  in  financeblog financeblog urls.py.  As  we  will  see  shortly,  in  this main file, we’ll point to different locations – views and urls.py files of other applications - in our Web App.  central   being   one   file   the   The URL pattern will have a View associated with it. Django will run that View and if any parameters are sent with the request, pass them to the View. The response returned by the View will be sent back to the User.  Practice  Create a “urls.py” file inside the blog application and the following code  to create URL patterns for our two views.  from django.urls import path from . import views  urlpatterns = [ path "", views.list_blogs, name="blog_list" , path "blog  ", views.detail_blog, name="blogs_detail" , ]  Code 9 - financeblog blog urls.py   We use the “path” function to create a URL pattern. The first argument is the URL path, and the second is the view we want to associate with this URL path pattern and a named argument called name.  Our first URL pattern is empty and takes no parameters, and is linked to our list_blogs view – the one method we defined in the last section. We call it “blog_list” and we can use this name inside our project to refer to this URL pattern.  Our second URL path takes an argument – only now our URL path truly becomes a pattern. After the keyword “blog ”, we pass it a value of type int, meaning that it must be a number, and we have given it the name of pk. The variable  pk  will  be  available  to  us  inside  the  View  under  the  name  of  pk. That’s why we passed a parameter of “pk” to our blog_detail view method.  We have to include the URL patterns of our blog application inside our project’s main “urls.py”  file.  Open  the  “urls.py”  inside  the  “financeblog” directory and put the following:  from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include  urlpatterns = [ path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path '', include 'blog.urls'   ]  Code 10 - financeblog financeblog urls.py  We  tell  Django  to  include  the  URL  patterns  defined  inside  the  blog application under the “ ” path. Since we want to display blogs on our home page where the URL will be localhost:8000 , we don’t want to put our blog's URL patterns under the “blog ” path as the “admin ” has done. That is why we are leaving it empty here.   Template Views Theory  A Template in Django is a file with an ending of *.html. This Document is  a  merger  of  static  HTML  Content  and  dynamic  Content  supplied  by views.py. In views.py, we pass dynamic data to the template  e.g., User data, Pictures,  Menu  items,  etc. .  The  passed  dynamic  data  will  be  a  Python dictionary.  Django will look for templates inside the templates  directory of each of our  applications.  Note  that  Django  doesn’t  differentiate  between  template directories  of  different  applications.  It  treats  them  as  if  they  were  all  in  a single directory.  That is why, for isolation, we create another directory by the name of the application inside the application_name templates  directory and store our template  files  inside  that  directory.  So,  we’ll  be  placing  our  templates  into blog templates blog . It’s slightly confusing, but we will get there!  Using  Django  templates,  we  can  do  a  lot  more  than  just  display  static  HTML files. We can perform  -          loops inside our templates, -          conditionals  if, else-if, else , -          inherit from other templates -          and much more.  Django provides a straightforward syntax for the templating engine. We  can create and use  -          template tags ≈≈ {% tag_name %} -          template variables that look like ≈≈ {{ variable }} -          template filters that we can call on our variables ≈≈ {{ variablefilter   }}  Create a templates directory inside your blog application. Now create a folder called blog  inside  the  templates  directory  –  as  explained  previously. Lastly,  create  three  HTML  files  called  base.html   note  that  .html  is  an extension, not part of the name , list.html, and detail.html. You should have a directory structure inside the blog application like the following figure.    Figure 16 - Templates folder structure for the App 'Blog'  The base.html will hold content that all of our pages templates will share  Practice  Main Parent Template  -          HTML   tag, -          CSS, -          JavaScript CDNs -          Other files -          navigation bar -          etc.  This is the foundation template from which all of our other models will be extracted. Add the following to the base.html. Anything that your Web App needs on a global level  say font or icon files  is the place for it.   {% load static %}             <link   rel="stylesheet"  href="https:  cdn.jsdelivr.net npm bootstrap@4.5.3 dist css bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384- TX8t27EcRE3e ihU7zmQxVncDAy5uIKz4rEkgIXeMed4M0jlfIDPvg6uqKI2xXr2" crossorigin="anonymous">    <link   href="https:  fonts.googleapis.com css2?  family=Poppins:wght@400;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">     My Finance Blog                 My  Financial  Blog         {% block content %} {% endblock content %} <script   src="https:  code.jquery.com jquery-3.5.1.min.js"   integrity="sha256-  9 aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous">   <script   src="https:  cdn.jsdelivr.net npm bootstrap@4.5.3 dist js bootstrap.bundle.min.js"  integrity="sha384- ho+j7jyWK8fNQe+A12Hb8AhRq26LrZ JpcUGGOn+Y7RsweNrtN tE3MoK7ZeZDyx" crossorigin="anonymous">             Code 11 - financeblog blog templates blog base.html  This  is  just  a  simple  bootstrap  HTML  document.  We’ve  included  the bootstrap  CSS,  js,  jquery,  and  a  js-cookie  library  via  CDN.    To  load  local static files such as CSS and js files, we have to call the “{% load static %}” template tag at the top of our document, which is what we have done here. This gives us access to the “{% static “path_to_file” %}” template tag. Find the link tag in the head tag:      You can see it is using the static template tag and looking for a main.css file.  Let’s  add  the  main.css  file.  Create  the  following  directory  structure inside the blog application.     Figure 17 - Folder Structure for Static Django Assets  As you can see, we apply the same structure to static  directories as we did to templates  directories. So, what is happening here is following: with the ‘static’ template tag, we tell Django to replace the  {% static 'blog main.css' %}  Part with a working path pointing to our Django static folder in the blog application – more specifically, the static asset main.css. I assume you hate CSS – I’ve heard some backend developers do – so we will skip this part. Please copy the main.css from the GitHub repo into the previously mentioned location in your App. Otherwise, you may go through the main.css yourself or create your styles.  wget   Book master blog static blog main.css  https:  raw.githubusercontent.com AndreyBulezyuk Django-3-  Terminal   The  navbar  logo  links  to  our  list_blog  view’s  URL  using  the  {%  url     ‘blog_list’ %} template tag.  Template blocks and inheritance  After the header tag in the body of the base.html, you should’ve noticed the  {%  block  %}  tag.  We  can  name  our  block  template  tags,  and  we  are calling it “content”, so it becomes {% block content %}.  This  template  tag  will  create  a  block  in  our  document.  Templates  that inherit  from  this  base.html  template  can  fill  this  block  with  data,  tags,  or comments.  Note  that  the  block  template  tag  has  a  closing  tag  called  “{% endblock %}”. Let’s edit the template of our list_blog view, which is located at templates>blog>list.html inside the blog application.  {% extends "blog base.html" %}  {% block content %}       you succeed.                     Finance blogs to help    {% for blog in blogs %}           {{blog.author.username}}     <small      class="text-muted">{{blog.date_publisheddate:"d m Y   h:i   a"}}            {{blog.title}}   {{blog.contenttruncatewords:30}}  <a href="{% url 'blogs_detail' blog.pk %}"  class="font-weight-bold  mb-3  d-inline-block">  Read More              {% endfor %}   {% endblock content %}  Code 12 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\list.html  At the top, we are using the extends template tag to tell Django that this template inherits from the base.html template. Next, we are adding content to the content block we created in base.html.  We are looping over the blogs list we passed to this template through the view and display the blog title, author of the blog, published date of the blog, and body of the blog. The following picture visualizes the way list.html and base.html will work together.      Figure 18 - Template extends tag, similar to Parent-Child Relationship  We are also adding a link to the detail_blog view using the url template tag i.e. “{% url ‘blogs_detail’ blog.pk %}”. We are passing it the pk  primary key  of the blog object as required in our blog_detail view.  By  default,  Django  date  fields  display  time  and  date,  but  we  wanted  to display  only  the  date  and  in  a  specific  format.  For  that,  we  used  the  date template filter on the date_published field.  We  have  also  used  a  template  filter  on  the  content  of  the  body, “{{blog.contenttruncatewords:30}}”,  called truncatewords. This template filter limits the word count of our blogs’ content and will only display up to   30 words. If the user wants to read more, they can visit the detail page of that specific blog.    So,  let’s  edit  the  template  of  our  detail_blog  view  which  is  located  at  templates>blog>detail.html inside the blog application:  {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}             {{blog.author.username}}      {{blog.publish_datedate:"d m Y h:i a"}}         {{blog.title}}        {{blog.content}}                  {% endblock content %}  Code 13 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\detail.html  We are doing the same thing as we have done with the list.html template. We  are  extending  from  the  base.html  template.  We  are  then  opening  the content  block  and  filling  it  with  content.  Unlike  the  list  template,  which receives  a  list  of  Blog  objects,  the  detail  template  receives  only  a  single Blog object. That is the reason we are not performing any loops here.  Results  http:  localhost:8000:  Make   sure  your  development   server   is   running   and  open         Figure 19 - List Template Top Page  Figure 20 - List Template Blog Display   On the homepage of our website, you can now see a heading and a list of blogs. This is the list_blog view. We show the date a blog was created, who created the blog, the blog's title, a short description of the blog, and a “read more” button that will lead you to the detail_blog view of a specific blog.  Note  the  URL  of  a  blog's  detail  page,  and  it  has  a  number  after  the “blog ”. This number here is the pk of a blog instance and will be passed to our view, and our view will then use it to find a blog object instance – see code on page 123. If found, it will return to this page. Otherwise, we will be shown a 404 error. Click the “read more” button of any of the blogs, and it will lead you to that blog’s specific detail page.    Figure 21 - Detail Template  Albeit very minimal, we now have a working blogging site where users can read blogs. The homepage lists the available blogs, and each blog has a detail page.  Let’s  recap  what  we  have  just  done  with  the  following  simplified   and   intentionally  incomplete   representation.  The  flow  starts  with  the  request being routed via urls.py to the right view. In views.py the right view is being invoked. The business logic is applied  like CRUD Operations on Models , and the template is rendered.    Figure 22 - Simplified Representation of the Request Flow  So,  in  essence,  whenever  you  need  to  add  a  browsable  page  to  your Django  Project,  this  is  roughly  the  process  you  have  to  go  through.  Our website is far from finished. Let’s expand our application’s functionalities in the next chapter.     APPLICATION  We  did  pretty  well  so  far.  This  chapter  will  create  a  new  application, repeating  some  steps  from  the  previous  Chapter  while  injecting  new  ones. For  example,  we  will  learn  how  to  use  new  Field  Types  in  models,  create Forms and use a Django feature called “Signals.”  Right now, our blog application has a minimal set of functionalities – not useful for anything. Only a superuser can create blogs through the admin site. We  want  regular  users  to  post  blogs,  but  we  don’t  want  regular  users  to access our admin site.  We have no register, login, or logout functionalities on our site yet. In this chapter,  we  will  create  all  the  components  that  these  functionalities  consist of. With that in place, new users can register on our website.  New Profiles Application  Theory  We want to give our users the ability to have a profile picture and post a short description about themselves. If you remember, Django gives us a User model out of the box, but it doesn’t have an image or a description field. We can  either  extend  the  existing  User  model  or  create  another  model  called Profile and give it a One-to-One relationship with the User model.  We  will  go  with  the  latter  approach  as  it  is  the  preferred  way.  This approach  is  preferred  because  we  won’t  have  to  re-code  many  built-in functionalities of the built-in User model  e.g., login, register, etc. . Also, this will prevent unintended consequences down the road, e.g., when applying a Django update that alters the User model in some way. You’ll see a simple Class  Diagram  displaying  the  relationship  between  our  two  models  in  the below figure.      Figure 23 - One-to-One Relationship between Django-supplied User and manually-created  Profile model  Practice  Creating an Application  Let’s create an application called profiles. Close the server, go to the root  directory of the project, and type the following command.     MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>python manage.py startapp profiles  Terminal  Running this command should create a “profiles” application for us. We will  put  every  User  related  feature  in  this  application.  Let’s  register  this application within our current project. Open the settings.py file of the project inside  financeblog   and  add  the INSTALLED_APPS list.    the  name  of  our  application   to   INSTALLED_APPS = [ 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles',   'blog', 'profiles' ]  Code 14 financeblog\financeblog\settings.py  On  server  restart,  Django  will  be  loading  the  source  code  profiles application.  Then  we  create  a  couple  of  new  entries  and,  before  that,  a migration.  Creating Model  As stated before, Django’s built-in User model does not provide an image or a description field. That’s why we will create a new model called Profile and give it an image and a description field. We will then give it a one-to-one relationship with the User model to only have one Profile and vice versa.  This Profile Model is the place for further fields for your App Users. One could  imagine  fields  like  ‘LinkedIn  Profile’,  ‘Instagram  Page’,  ‘Phone Number’, ‘Years of Experience in Django’ to be at the right place in Profile. Your Users Payment Methods, on the other hand, would be best outsourced into another model.  Add  the  following  code  to  the  models.py  file  of  the  newly  created  profiles application.  from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User  class Profile models.Model : user = models.OneToOneField User, on_delete=models.CASCADE  image = models.ImageField default="default.jpg", upload_to="profile_pictures"  description = models.CharField max_length=500, blank=True   def __str__ self :  return f'{self.user.username}\'s Profile...'   Code 15 financeblog\profiles\models.py  Let’s go over the fields:  -                   user: We are defining a One-to-One Relationship with the User  model, i.e., one user can only have one profile and vice versa.  -          description: It is a simple CharField. We are setting blank to True because we don’t want to force our users to write a description about themselves if they don’t want to. One can think of setting the default parameter to something like “This profile has no description yet”.  -                   image: We are defining an ImageField type. Django doesn’t store images  as  binary  data  in  the  database.  It  stores  them  on  the  file system and saves a path in the database field. We are specifying a default Image; in case the user doesn’t upload one. In upload_to, we set a path where to store the Images: profile_pictures . By default, Django will store user uploaded files defined by the MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT settings  more in the next Section .  You  can  also  do  some  minor  database  optimizations  by  omitting  the  default parameter for specific fields.  Take description as an example. You could provide a default value that is about 1KB in size. If you have 100.000 Entries with a default value, you are adding 100 MB to your DB. In this scenario, it’s advised to create a model method   just  like  we  created  __str__     to  return  the  necessary  default information if the field is empty.    Applying Model to Database  Note: Our environment needs the package “Pillow” to work with Images in Django. Otherwise, you might get an Error while creating migrations in the next Paragraph. The Exception will look like this:            SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues: ERRORS: profiles.Profile.image:  fields.E210  Cannot use ImageField because Pillow is not installed.

OK  Configuring Media Server Paths  We need to configure the MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT settings to specify  where  our  images  are  saved  and  under  what  path  we  have  them available. Open the settings.py and add the following code:    import os MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join BASE_DIR, 'media'  MEDIA_URL = ' media '  Code 16 financeblog\financeblog\settings.py  We are importing the os module and using it to set the MEDIA_ROOT to a directory called media in our project's root directory. Next, we define the MEDIA_URL, so any user uploaded files will become available to us under the path “media ” after the domain of the site.         Configuring Media URLs  To  serve  user  uploaded  files  during  development,  we  have  to  add  the following  change  to  the  urls.py  file  of  the  project  inside  the  financeblog directory:    from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include from django.conf import settings from django.conf.urls.static import static urlpatterns = [ path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path '', include 'blog.urls'   ] urlpatterns += static settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT   Code 17 financeblog\financeblog\urls.py  Here  we  are  building  the  path  for  our  files,  and  we  are  making  them available  under  the MEDIA_URL setting. Do note that this is not the preferred way of serving files in production.  the  path  “ media ”  which  we  have  given   to   We  have  configured  our  Django  project’s  settings  to  upload  profile pictures, but we haven’t created the directories for it. In the root directory of the project, create a directory called media. Inside it, put a jpg image by the name “default.jpg” and create a folder called profile_pictures.    The  default.jpg  image  is  for  when  the  user  doesn’t  upload  an  image themselves.  The  profile_pictures  is  the  directory  where  the  user-uploaded images will actually be saved. You should now have the following directory structure for the media directory inside the root directory of the project:      Open  the  admin.py  file  inside  the  profiles  application  and  add  the  following code to register our Profile model to the admin site:    Testing the Profile Model  Register the Profile Model  from django.contrib import admin from .models import Profile admin.site.register Profile   Code 18 financeblog\profiles\admin.py   Make  sure  the  development  server  is  running  and  head  over  to http:  localhost:8000 admin  and  log  in.  Click  on  the  profiles  link,  and  it should lead you to the following page. Why would you not want to include a model entity into the admin site UI? Because some models are supposed to be background only  e.g. Logging, Backup Tracking, ... .     Figure 24 Admin side UI  As  you  can  see,  there  aren’t  any  Profile  objects  yet.  We  only  have  a  single user in our database right now, i.e., the superuser root.     Creating and associating a new Profile  Let’s create the root’s profile. Click the “Add Profile’:      Figure 25 Adding a profile     you to the following page:    I’ve purposefully left the image field blank. Click save, and it should lead         Figure 26 List profile view  Interestingly Django makes an effort to adjust the name of the object so that the one-to-one relationship between user and profile becomes apparent. I’m  talking  about  the  “root’s  Profile”.  Let’s  click  on  the  Profile  we  just created, and it should show you the following.    Figure 27 root profile view  As you can see, since we didn’t explicitly set an image for the profile, it chose a default image as we specified in our models.py file. Clicking on the image will show you the image.        Figure 28 Uploaded Image view in web  Note the URL of the image is pointing to the “media ” path. Everything works perfectly. We can now create a view, templates and display this stuff on the main website, but we have to take care of a minor problem first.   Problem with the Profile Model Discovering the  foreseeable  Issue  Let’s  add  a  new  user  through  the  admin  site.  Open  the  admin  site  and  click the add link next to User:     Figure 29 Adding link  After you have added the user successfully, go to the Profiles section in     the admin site:     Figure 30 Profile Section in Admin Site  The  profile  for  our  newly  created  user  was  not  created  automatically. Remember,  the  Profile  is  a  separate  model  and  only  shares  a  one-to-one relationship with the User model. This one-to-one relationship is set to one column attribute only. This does not force a new profile entry to be created in a database when a new User is being created.        Solution  We want a new profile to be created automatically when a user is created and associate it with the new user. Luckily, there’s something called Django Signals which can help us in this situation.    Django Signals Emit and Listen - Send and Receive   Using Django signals, we can allow applications to be notified when an action  occurs.  In  simple  terms,  we  will  create  a  receiver  in  our  application whose  job  is  to  listen  for  signals.  Django  will  emit  signals  whenever something is done in our application. We can tell our receiver function what signal it should listen to.     For  example,  using  the  post_save  signal  and  a  receiver,  we  can  be notified whenever the User model is created. We can automate the process of creating a Profile for that newly created User.  Automating the creation of Profile  Open  the  models.py  file  of  your  profiles  application  and  make  the  following changes, so your models.py file looks like this:     from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User NEW CODE BELOW from django.db.models.signals import post_save from django.dispatch import receiver NEW CODE ABOVE  class Profile models.Model : user = models.OneToOneField User, on_delete=models.CASCADE  image = models.ImageField default="default.jpg", upload_to="profile_pictures"  description = models.CharField max_length=500, blank=True   def __str__ self :  return f'{self.user.username}\'s Profile...'  NEW CODE BELOW @receiver post_save, sender=User  def create_profile sender, instance, created, **kwargs : if created:  Profile.objects.create user=instance   NEW CODE ABOVE  Code 19 financeblog\profiles\models.py     We  are  importing  a  signal  called  post_save.  Next,  we  are  importing  a  function called the receiver.  Below  our  Profile  model,  we  have  created  a  function  called create_profile  that  is  decorated  by  the  receiver  function.  The  receiver function takes two parameters. The first one specifies a signal, and the second one  takes  the  User  model.  It  means  that  whenever  a  User  model  has  been saved, Django will emit a Signal which we want to receive. After receiving the Django Signal, we are calling the create_profile function and executing our business logic.  Our  receiver  function  passes  several  arguments  to  the  create_profile function. The created parameter is a boolean value that tells us whether the sender  object  was  created  or  updated.  Inside  the  create_profile  function body, we create a Profile object and set its user field to the User that was just   created.  We  put  our  signals  and  receivers  inside  the  models.py  file  of  the application Profile.  Verifying the results     Now open the admin site and delete the test user we previously created:  Figure 31 Deleting User  Now add a new user as described on previous pages and call it - again - test. After creating the user successfully, go to the Profiles page in the admin site to verify that the signal received successfully and the profile was created.     Figure 32 After adding a new user  You can see that Django automatically created the Profile of the User test we just created. We don’t have to worry about creating profiles manually, as those will get created automatically whenever a user is created.    Delete Profile automatically  Just as we want the Profile of each user to be created automatically, we want  each  Profile  to  be  deleted  when  a  user  is  deleted.  Let’s  check  if  that behavior is already implemented by deleting a random  non-superuser  user. I created  manually  a  User  Account  for  myself.  Now  let’s  delete  it  inside Django shell:    Terminal  >>> python manage.py shell  >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User             >>> andrey = User.objects.get pk=2   >>> andrey     >>> andrey.delete     2, {'profiles.Profile': 1, 'auth.User': 1}             >>> exit      As  the  output  of  “andrey.delete  ”  already  indicates,  two  objects  were deleted:  profile.  Profile  and  auth.User.  This  means  that  Profile  is  being deleted  automatically  when  a  User  Account  is  deleted.  As  a  refresher:  this logic is not covered with a Signal but with the one-to-one relationship in the Profile model. To be more precise, it’s the on_delete parameter.    user = models.OneToOneField User, on_delete=models.CASCADE   Account Creation Now  that  our  Profile  model  is  working  correctly,  we  create  a  register page so that users can create a new account on our website. Let’s see how we can accept user data in Django.    Accepting User Input using Forms  We use Django’s Form system to accept user input. Using Django forms, we  can  easily  define  our  form  fields  and  conveniently  display  them  on  the template very quickly. We can collect data from users and validate it in our view with the is_valid method. If errors are found, then the user is sent back to the form with error messages.     When the validation is done, we have access to all the data submitted by the  user  in  a  cleaned_data  dictionary  on  the  form  instance.  We  can  then   perform  further  actions  on  the  validated  data  -  e.g.:  apply  further  business logic.     By default, Django provides two base form classes, i.e., forms.Form and forms.ModelForm. We create our forms by inheriting from either of the two. Kind of like models, the attributes of our form class will represent a field in the HTML form.  Django forms.Form  If we extend from forms.Form,  we get an empty skeleton form where we  have  to  configure  everything  ourselves,  from  creating  fields  and  field types  to  handling  data  after  it’s  validated  inside  the  view.  This  is  suitable when we are not doing anything that directly affects a model, for example, creating a newsletter or a contact us form.    Django forms.ModelForm  On the other hand, if we extend from forms.ModelForm, we will have a form tied to a specific model. The form fields are automatically generated for us  based  on  the  model  we  provide  our  form.  But  we  can  configure  the premade fields as we need. This form also gives us a save method, which will automatically save or update an instance of the model to the database if form fields were validated. A form created using ModelForm will validate its field based on the fields that are defined in the model itself. We can, however, if, for  some  reason,  we  want  our  form  fields  of  a  model,  validate  the  fields differently from the definitions defined in the model itself.    Create a file called forms.py inside the profiles application and add the  Register Form  following code:     from django import forms from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm from django.contrib.auth.models import User  class RegisterForm UserCreationForm : first_name = forms.CharField max_length=50, required=True  last_name = forms.CharField max_length=50, required=True  email = forms.EmailField required=True   class Meta:  model = User fields = ['email', 'username', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'password1', 'password2']  Code 20 financeblog\profiles\forms.py     This  is  our  registration  form.  Note  that  our  RegisterForm  class  is  not inheriting from either Form or ModelForm. Instead, it is inheriting from a class  called  UserCreationForm.  As  stated  earlier,  Django  provides  an authentication system out of the box which has a User model. Django also provides  a  form  for  creating  the  mentioned  User  that  takes  care  of  various validations  such  as  checking  the  passwords  etc.  Under  the  hood,  this UserCreationForm class inherits from ModelForm.    We could have used this UserCreationForm as is in our view. The form would  still  work  just  fine.  But  the  form  would  only  show  username, password,  and  password  confirmation  fields  on  our  registration  page. These are the required fields of Django’s User model as defined in its model definitions.    However,  we  also  want  to  show  the  other  optional  fields  of  the  User model, which are first_name, last_name, and email. We also want to make them  required.  That  the UserCreationForm.   further  configuring   is  why  we  are   We  define  the  fields  first_name  and  last_name    and  set  their  type  to CharField and their required attribute to True. We are also defining email  type: EmailField  and also setting its required attribute to True. As stated   earlier, these fields are not required in Django’s User model, and the user can leave them blank. However, we want to require these fields so a user can’t leave them empty. That is the only reason we are redefining them.    ModelForm Meta Class  Informs  inheriting  from  ModelForm,  we  have  to  define  a  Meta  class inside the form class. The Meta class must define the attribute called model to pass the model we want our form to be built for.   Optionally,  we  can  define  the  attribute  fields,  which  must  be  a  list  of fields from the model. If we don’t provide this field, ModelForm will build a form with every field from the model.   Django’s  User  model  also  has  other  fields  like  is_active,  is_staff, is_superuser, etc. We don’t want to display them in the form. That is why we are only including the six fields in the fields attribute. Those are the fields that  we  want  to  be  displayed  on  the  registration  page.  Now  that  we  have created a form.  Let us build a view for our register page.    Creating User Register View  Open  views.py  inside  the  profiles  application  and  add  the  following  code:    from django.shortcuts import render, redirect from .forms import RegisterForm  def register request : if request.method == "POST":  form = RegisterForm request.POST  if form.is_valid  :  form.save   return redirect 'blog_list'   else:  form = RegisterForm    return render request, "profiles register.html", {"form": form}    Code 21 financeblog\profiles\views.py     We  are  creating  a  view  called  register.  We  are  checking  whether  the request performed by the client is a POST request or not. Whenever we open a link or visit a page, we perform a GET request, but when we submit a form to  a  webpage,  we  are  performing  a  POST  request.  That  is  what  we  are checking here through the request.method value.  If  the  request  method  is  POST,  we  are  instantiating  an  instance  of  the RegisterForm, and passing it the data the user sent through the form on the website, which is available to us under request.POST.  Afterward, we are calling the is_valid method of our RegisterForm. It will perform  default  validation  of  the  fields  defined  in  our  form  or  any  custom validation we might have added. If the data submitted by the user is valid and doesn’t cause any errors, we are executing the save method. This method will create a new User in the database.  Note  that  this  save  method  only  comes  with  forms  that  inherit  from ModelForm. The reason we used UserCreationForm is that it also adds other validation for us such as checking the password length and matching if the two passwords match or not.  Once  the  form  is  saved  and  a  new  user  is  created,  we  are  using  the function redirect, which will redirect us to another page. We pass it the URL name  of  our  blog  its  URL  pattern  finanaceblog blog urls.py .    that  we  defined   list  view   in   path "", views.list_blogs, name="blog_list" ,  If  the  request  performed  by  the  user client  is  not  POST,  meaning  they opened the register page on their browser  remember this is a GET request as they  haven’t  sent  any  data ,  we  are  instantiating  an  empty  instance  of  the   RegisterForm.  Lastly, we are returning the render method with the template we want our  view to link with and pass our form to the template.    URL pattern for Register View  Now that the register view has been created, we have to define its URL pattern. Unlike we did with the blog application where we created a separate URLs  file  inside  the  application,  we  will  include  the  URL  patterns  of  our profiles application directly in the urls.py file of the project. That is because we  want  to  show  these  URL  patterns  right  after  the  domain  name  and  not under some path like “ accounts” or “ profiles”.  Open the urls.py of the project inside the financeblog directory and add  the following import.  from profiles import views as profiles_views  Here  we  are  importing  the  views  of  our  profiles  application  as  profile_views. Next, add the following URL pattern to the urlpatterns list:    path 'register ', profiles_views.register, name="register"   Here we are defining a URL pattern to our register view under the path “register ”. We have given it the name register. Just to make things clear, this is how the urls.py file of your financeblog directory should look like after making the changes above:    from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include from django.conf import settings from django.conf.urls.static import static NEW CODE BELOW from profiles import views as profiles_views   NEW CODE ABOVE urlpatterns = [ path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path '', include 'blog.urls'  ,  user related paths below path 'register ', profiles_views.register, name="register"   user related paths above ] urlpatterns += static settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT   Code 22 financeblog\financeblog\urls.py  Creating Template for the Register View  Inside the profiles application, create the following directory structure:     This register.html file is what our register view will look for based on its render  function’s  path.  Add  the  following  markup  to  the  register.html  we just created:    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}             Register                         {% csrf_token %} {{form.as_p}}       Login?             {% endblock content %}   Submit   Code 23 financeblog\profiles\templates\profiles\register.html     Just as we did with the blog detail and blog list view, we are inheriting from the base.html template. Next, we are opening the content blocks and adding  our  content  between  the  tags.  We  are  creating  a  heading  that  says “Register”. Lastly, we are creating the form with the method set to ”POST” because by default, the default method of HTML forms is GET.  Inside the form, we are calling the csrf_token template tag. This token is used to ensure that the form was sent and created by one of the trusted hosts defined  under  the  ALLOWED_HOSTS  setting.  Whenever  dealing  with forms,  you  have  to  use  this  template  tag.  Otherwise,  you  will  get  a  403 forbidden error.  Next, we put our form variable inside the HTML form by simply calling the as_p method on it. This will automatically output the form fields inside our html form. The as_p method will wrap our fields inside a paragraph tag before outputting them to the markup.  Note that the form variable will only create the input fields, we have to create  the  submit  button  and  the  html  form  wrapper  additionally.  We  have also  created  a  Login  link  at  the  bottom  that  currently  doesn’t  lead  you anywhere as we have yet to create a login page.            Verifying the Register View Results  Open http:  localhost:8000 register and you should see the following:  Figure 33 Register View  You  can  see  that  just  outputting  the  form  variable  created  all  of  these fields for us. It also added some helper text that comes with the User model by default. Now try adding some information to the form and submit it. I will intentionally submit the incorrect data to show you that the validation works.        Figure 34 Intentionally wrong data fillup  I supplied an invalid email address and wrote different passwords in the password and password confirmation fields. You can see that it is printing the errors “Enter a valid email address” and “The two passwords don’t match”. Perfect,  the  validation  works.  We  can  be  sure  that  all  User  Accounts  will have a certain degree of data quality.   Now let’s input correct data and try creating a user. If we are successful, we should get redirected to the homepage where all of our blogs are listed. I will create a user, john.        Figure 35 Filling correct data  I  was  successfully  redirected  to  the  homepage.  It  means  our  User  was created.  Open  the  admin  site  and  make  sure  that  john’s  User  Object  and john’s Profile Object do exist.    Figure 36 User list   Adding Django Plugin “Crispy Forms”  Our register page works fine, but the form doesn’t look good at all. We are not controlling the markup of the fields, errors, and helper text ourselves. Instead, we are leaving it up to Django ModelForm.  We can gain more control by looping over the form variable and handling how to display each field and related data such as errors. But that would be too  time-consuming  if  our  goal  is  simply  to  have  fields  that  look  more organized. Luckily we have a package called django-crispy forms that will automatically convert our forms to bootstrap forms. Close the development server and install the package through the following command.    Terminal   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>pip install django-crispy-forms  Open the settings.py file of the project and add the crispy form App to  INSTALLED_APPS. Your list of installed apps should look like this:    INSTALLED_APPS = [ 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'blog', 'profiles', 'crispy_forms', ]  Figure 37 financeblog\financeblog\settings.py   Also, add the following setting in the settings.py file:  CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4'         django-crispy-form will use this setting to convert our Django forms to bootstrap  4  templates  which  is  what  we  are  using.  Now  open  the register.html  inside  the  profiles  application  under  the  path  templates  > profiles > register.html and add the following template tag at the top after the extends template tag:    {% load crispy_forms_tags %}  We are loading the template tags of the package we just installed through this  template  tag.  Now  in  the  same  file,  scroll  down  to  where  we  are outputting our form as {{form.as_p}} and change it to:    {{formcrispy}}  We have removed the as_p method and are now calling the crispy filter  on our form variable. Now your register.html file should look like this:  {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block content %}             Register                        {% csrf_token %} {{formcrispy}}       Login?       Submit                 {% endblock content %}  Code 24 financeblog\profiles\templates\profiles\register.html  Run the development server and validate that the register page works as intended. Create a couple of new accounts and test the limits, required fields, lengths, etc.      Figure 38 Updated register page  You  can  see  that  our  form  now  looks  completely  different  -  definitely better. The crispy template filter that we applied to our form will render our form according to bootstrap 4 classes now defined in the settings.py file in the setting CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK.     Figure 39 Crispy Template filter effect  Another  obvious  point  is  that  the  error  messages  are  highlighted  and  attract attention to correct the inputs.    Django Messages Framework  Our register view works. The forms look great. There is just one thing left to  complete  it,  and  these  are  flash  messages.  In  web  applications,  a  flash message  is  a  one-time  message  shown  to  the  user  once  they  perform  some action, e.g. user either created something or deleted something. We will show them a message whether it was successful or not.     In  our  case,  we  want  to  display  a  one-time  message  after  the  user  has successfully  registered.  Django  has  a  message  system  that  allows  us  to  do this very quickly.  Open the views.py file of the profiles application and add the following import to import django’s message framework:    from django.contrib import messages   Next, in the register view, add the following line of code right before the  redirect function call after we are calling the save method on the form:    messages.success request, "User created successfully!"   We  are  creating  a  flash  message,  and  it  is  of  type  success.  We  have different  types  of  messages,  e.g.,  info,  warning,  etc.  You  can  use  it  to determine  what  sort  of  styles  you  want  to  apply  for  different  kinds  of messages on the template. The first parameter is always the request object, and the second parameter is our message we want to show.  After making the changes, this is how your register view should look like:    def register request : if request.method == "POST":  form = RegisterForm request.POST  if form.is_valid  :  form.save   messages.success request, "User created successfully!"  return redirect 'blog_list'   else:  form = RegisterForm    return render request, "profiles register.html", {"form": form}   Code 25 financeblog profiles views.py     Open  the  base.html  file  inside  templates>blog  directory  of  your  blog application  where  all  of  our  templates  extend  from  and  add  the  following code after the content block:    {% if messages %}  {% for message in messages %}  role="alert">  <div  class="alert  alert-{{  message.tags  }}  alert-dismissible  fade  show  custom-alert"   {{ message }}      ×         {% endfor %}  {% endif %}   Code 26 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\base.html     We are checking if any messages have been sent. If there are messages, we  are  looping  over  the  sent  messages  and  displaying  them  through  the message  variable  inside  an  alert  container.  The  color  of  the  alert  is determined  by  the  message.tags  variable,  which  will  tell  us  the  type  of message i.e., success, info or warning etc. Next, we are displaying the actual message. After making the changes, your base.html file should look like this:    {% load static %}              <link   rel="stylesheet"  href="https:  cdn.jsdelivr.net npm bootstrap@4.5.3 dist css bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384- TX8t27EcRE3e ihU7zmQxVncDAy5uIKz4rEkgIXeMed4M0jlfIDPvg6uqKI2xXr2" crossorigin="anonymous">    <link   href="https:  fonts.googleapis.com css2?  family=Poppins:wght@400;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">     My Finance Blog                 My  Financial  Blog          {% block content %} {% endblock content %}  {% if messages %} {% for message in messages %}  role="alert">  <div  class="alert  alert-{{  message.tags  }}  alert-dismissible  fade  show  custom-alert"   {{ message }}       ×         {% endfor %}  {% endif %} <script         src="https:  code.jquery.com jquery-3.5.1.min.js"   integrity="sha256-  9 aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous">   <script   src="https:  cdn.jsdelivr.net npm bootstrap@4.5.3 dist js bootstrap.bundle.min.js"  integrity="sha384- ho+j7jyWK8fNQe+A12Hb8AhRq26LrZ JpcUGGOn+Y7RsweNrtN tE3MoK7ZeZDyx" crossorigin="anonymous">       Code 27 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\base.html     Now  go  to  http:  localhost:8000 register  and  create  a  user.  After  you create the user and get redirected to the home page, you should now see an alert message in the right bottom corner.    Figure 40 User creation alert  Remember the one-time message we talked about? Refresh the page, and you should not see the alert message again. This is very useful to notify the user whether an action took place and whether that action was successful or   not. Login and Logout Creating Views  Now that we have built the register view, it only makes sense to create the login and logout views. Django’s built-in auth application already has a login and logout view, so we will use them instead of making ours from scratch.  By default, these views will render the admin site's template page, but we will  be  changing  these  defaults  to  display  our  custom  templates.  Open  the urls.py  file  of  the  project  inside  the  financeblog  directory  and  add  the following import:    from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views  We are importing the views of Django’s auth application as auth_views.  Next, add the following URL patterns inside the URL patterns list.    auth_views.LoginView.as_view template_name="profiles login.html" ,  path 'logout ',   auth_views.LogoutView.as_view template_name="profiles logout.html" ,  path 'login ',   name="login" ,  name="logout" ,  We are creating two new URL patterns for login and logout. We are then using Django auth’s LoginView and LogoutView. Note that these are class- based views  so far, we’ve only made functional views, but we will get into these shortly  and add class-based views.    We must add them by calling the function as_view of a class-based view. Next,  you  can  see  that  we  are  passing  a  template_name  to  the  as_view function. This will determine what template to display for these views. After making  the  changes,  your  project’s  urls.py  file  inside  the  financeblog directory should look like this.         from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include from django.conf import settings from django.conf.urls.static import static from profiles import views as profiles_views NEW CODE BELOW from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views NEW CODE ABOVE urlpatterns = [ path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path '', include 'blog.urls'  ,  user related paths below path 'register ', profiles_views.register, name="register" , path 'login ',  name="login" ,  path 'logout ',  name="logout" ,  auth_views.LoginView.as_view template_name="profiles login.html" ,  auth_views.LogoutView.as_view template_name="profiles logout.html" ,   user related paths above ] urlpatterns += static settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT   Code 28 financeblog\financeblog\urls.py  By default, LoginView will redirect us to a path of “accounts profile”. We don’t want that. We want to redirect to our homepage if a user logged in successfully. Open the settings.py file inside the financeblog directory  and add the following setting.    LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "blog_list"  Upon successful login, this setting will redirect us to the”blog_list” URL,  which is the name we gave to the homepage path.    Creating Templates  We’ve defined the paths for the login and logout templates, but they don’t exist  yet.  Create  two  files,  login.html  and  logout.html,  inside  the templates>profiles  directory  of  your  profiles  application.  Your  profiles application  should  now  have  the  following  directory  structure  for  the   templates directory.    Open the newly created login.html file and add the following code to it.         Log In   {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block content %}                           {% csrf_token %} {{formcrispy}}     Submit      Register?   Forgot Password?             {% endblock content %}  Code 29 financeblog\profiles\templates\profiles\login.html         This template is no different from our register.html template other than the fact that the heading now says “Login” and we’ve added two links below the form. One link leads to the register page and the other link for “Forgot Password” currently leads you nowhere. Open the logout.html  file  we  just created add the following code to it:    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}          You have been logged out.   Home          {% endblock content %}  Code 30 financeblog\profiles\templates\profiles\logout.html     If we are logged in and visit the logout link, Django will log us out and  show us this template. We are adding a link to the home page. Make  sure  you  are  logged  out  by  visiting  the  admin  site.  Next,  Open http:  localhost:8000 login.  I  will  intentionally  enter  incorrect  credentials  to see if we receive error messages as expected.        Figure 41 Login View  You can see that it does work. Now log in with the superuser and visit the admin site. You should be logged in. Let’s check our logout page. Make sure you are logged in and visit the link http:  localhost:8000 logout.     Figure 42 After Successful login  Now visit the admin site to check if you were logged out, and if you are shown  the  login  screen,  it  should  mean  that  you  were  indeed  logged  out successfully. Now that we have created the login page, we should go to the register template and add the login page link. Open the register.html file and scroll down to where it says:     Login?   Now change its href, so it points to our login page:         Login?   global Navigation Bar  Currently, we have no way to differentiate whether a user is logged in or not. We have to check with the admin site every time - obviously not usable. Let’s display the login and register links in the Navigation Bar if the user is not logged in and show a logout link if the user is logged in.  Open the base.html file inside the blog application’s  templates  >  blog  directory. Replace the header html tag with the following code.              My Financial Blog  <button   class="navbar-toggler"   data-toggle="collapse"   type="button"   data-  aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent"   aria-expanded="false"   aria-label="Toggle  target="navbarSupportedContent"  navigation">              {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}    Profile    Logout    Login    Register             {% else %}           {% endif %}               Code 31 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\base.html     Using the request  object,  we  have  access  to  the  user object associated with  a  request.  We  are  creating  navigation  links  and  we  have  added  a conditional using the if template tag.  We are using the attribute is_authenticated to determine whether the user is logged in or not. This value will be False if we are logged out and True when we are logged in. If we are authenticated, we are showing two links, logout and profile.  The profile doesn’t lead us anywhere currently and the logout page direct us to the logout page. If we are not authenticated, We are displaying the login and register navigations links. Remember that we are building the urls using the  url  template  tag  and  passing  it  the  name  we  gave  our  URL  patterns. Guests will see the following navigation bar.     Figure 43 After logout  When you are logged in, you should see Profiles and Logout:        Figure 44 Logged In. Hence there is a logout option   Creating Profile Frontend Profile View  Let’s  create  a  profile  view  that  will  be  responsible  for  displaying  the profile of a user. Open the views.py of the profiles application and add the following view.    def profile request, pk : user = get_object_or_404 User, pk=pk  return render request, "profiles profile.html", {"user": user}   Code 32 financeblog\profiles\views.py        This value is the same as our blog detail view. The only difference is we are fetching a User. It will display a 404 error if no user is found matching the  pk  we  provide  our  view.  Make  sure  to  import  the  get_object_or_404 function and User model.    Warning, this file is missing two imports, and you need to figure out what  is missing and import it  If you need help, take a look at it .    Profile URLs  Open the urls.py file of the project inside the financeblog directory and  add the following URL pattern to the urlpatterns list:     path 'profile  ',profiles_views.profile,name="profile"   Code 33 financeblog\blog\urls.py  This  URL  pattern  is  also  very  similar  to  our  blog  detail  view’s  URL pattern.  We  are  passing  a  value  pk  of  type  int,  which  means  it  will  be  a number. Next, we are routing the profile view we created in our views file to   the pattern. We’re also giving this URL pattern a name of a profile.    Profile Template  You  know  by  now,  add  a  file  called  profile.html   the templates>profiles  directory  of  your  profiles application,  where  all  of  our profiles application’s templates live. Add the following markup to it:    inside   {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}                  {{user.first_name}} {{user.last_name}}   {{user.profile.description}}  {% if request.user ==  user %}      Update Profile     {% endif %}         {% endblock content %}  Code 34 financeblog profiles templates profiles profiles.html     As  always,  we  are  extending  from  the  base.html  template.  We  are displaying  the  user’s  first  name  and  last  name.  Next,  we  are  showing  the description field that we added to the profile model.   Note  that  the  User  model  and  the  Profile  model  share  a  one-to-one relationship.  So  we  can  reverse-lookup  the  profile  associated  with  a  user using the user.profile.some_field syntax. That is how we are accessing the description field on the profile of a specific user.   We  are  displaying  the  image  we  added  to  the  profile  model.  We  are accessing  the  image’s  URL  that  is  available  by  the  URL  value  we  have available on image fields. If the user uploaded an image, it would show that one, and if they didn’t, it would show the default one.  Before  we  move  any  further,  let’s  add  our  profile  page  link  to  the navigation  bar.  Currently,  there  is  a  link  on  the  navigation  bar  shown  to logged-in  users  called  profile,  but  it  doesn’t  take  you  anywhere.  Open  the base.html  file  inside  the  blog  application’s  template  folder  and  find  the navigation tag:       Profile     Code 35 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\base.html  Now change it’s href so it leads us to our logged in user’s profile:     Profile     Code 36 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\base.html  We are passing it the profile url and also passing it the current logged in user’s  pk  that  is  available  to  us  on  the  request  object.  Now  open  the development server and visit the site. Make sure you are logged in and open; click on the profile link in the navigation bar. It should lead you to the profile page of the logged-in user:                 Figure 45 Logged In user  You can see that it works perfectly. Note that you can access other user’s profiles as well by directly typing their URL address. For example, this is the profile of another user:        Figure 46 Different user profile  Right  away,  you  can  notice  that  this  user  is  not  showing  the  “update profile” button. This is because of the conditional “{% if request.user == user  %}”  in  the  template.  We  are  checking  if  the  user  viewing  the  page  request.user  is the same user we are displaying  user .  This means users will only be shown the update button on their profile page only when they are logged in. Currently, this button leads you nowhere as we haven’t added a profile update view yet.   You should also notice that this user has no description yet, and that is because it is blank. On our register page, we were only accepting User model information.  We  need  a  form  to  fill  the  description  field  or  a  default description provider.  We never showed the description and image fields of the Profile model to the user. That was to keep the view simple and not overload the form. We will now also add the field image and description of the profile model on our update  page.  So  our  users  can  edit  the  details  of  their  page  once  they’ve signed up.   Profile Update Forms  Remember that User and Profile are two separate models. That is why we will create two forms that extend from ModelForm class. Open the forms.py file of the profiles application and add the following two forms:    class UserUpdateForm forms.ModelForm : email = forms.EmailField required=True  first_name = forms.CharField max_length=50, required=True  last_name = forms.CharField max_length=50, required=True  class Meta:  model = User   fields = [ 'email', 'username', 'first_name', 'last_name']  class ProfileUpdateForm forms.ModelForm : description = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea, max_length=500, required=False   class Meta:  model = Profile fields = ['description', 'image']  Figure 47 finanaceblog profiles forms.py     By the way, one import is missing in the code above...will you figure it out  before  getting  an  Exception?  We  are  creating  two  forms.  Let’s  look  at UserUpdateForm. It is very similar to our RegisterForm, but it is different as it doesn’t extend from UserCreationForm. We are only updating the user and not creating it. That’s why we will not be using the register form.  We  are  redefining  the  email,  first_name,  and  last_name  fields  to  make them required. Next, under the Meta class, we tell that we want this form tied to the User model. As for the fields, we are not including the password fields as we will not be updating those on the update page.  In the ProfileUpdateForm, we are redefining the description field. We set  the  description  as  a  CharField  on  the  model  definitions.  By  default, Django forms will render CharField as HTML input of type text. However, we want to show this field as an HTML textarea. We can do that through the widgets  attribute  of  a  form  field.  That  is  why  we  are  redefining  the description field in the ProfileUpdateForm.  We  are  also  giving  it  a  limit  of  500  characters  and  setting  the  required attribute to False. Next, under the metaclass, we are setting the Profile model to this form. We are then assigning the image and description values to the fields variable inside the Meta class. Our form will automatically generate the input for the image field.    Profile Update View   Open the views.py inside the profiles application and add the following  imports:          from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required from .forms import UserUpdateForm, ProfileUpdateForm  Code 37 financeblog\profiles\views.py  Next, add the following code to create the profile update view:  @login_required def update request : if request.POST:  user_form = UserUpdateForm request.POST, instance=request.user  profile_form   ProfileUpdateForm request.POST,   =   request.FILES,  instance=request.user.profile   if user_form and profile_form:  user_form.save   profile_form.save   messages.success request, "Profile Updated Successfully!"  return redirect 'profile', request.user.pk   user_form = UserUpdateForm instance=request.user  profile_form = ProfileUpdateForm instance=request.user.profile   else:  context = {  'user_form': user_form, 'profile_form': profile_form,  } return render request, 'profiles update.html', context   Code 38 financeblog\profiles\views.py  We  are  wrapping  our  update  view  with  the  login_required  decorator function we imported. It will only allow logged-in users to access this page. Next, as we did in the register view, we are checking if the request is of type POST or not. If it is, we are creating instances of the UserUpdateForm and ProfileUpdateForm  and  passing  them  the  user-submitted  data  through  the request.POST and request.FILES. Any images or files the user sends through the  form  are  not  available  under  request.POST,  but  somewhat  under request.FILES.  That  is  why  we  are  passing  it  to  our  ProfileUpdateForm   along with the request.POST.   We  are  also  passing  the  forms  an  instance  parameter.  To  the UserUpdateForm,  we  are  passing  the  currently  logged-in  user  available under request.user and to the ProfileUpdateForm we are passing the profile of  the  current  user  available  under  request.user.profile.  This  will  tell  the form to update these instances and not create new instances of the models on calling the save method.  Then we are calling the is_valid method on both of the forms. If both of the forms were validated, we are calling the save method on the form. This will update the instances of the user and profile model. If the forms were not valid, it will send us back to the update page with errors. After the form is saved  we  are  creating  a  flash  message  and  redirecting  the  user  back  to  the profile page.  If the request method was not POST, it means the user opened the update page. We are, again, instantiating both of the forms, but this time we aren’t passing the request.POST or request.FILES as no POST request was made. We are still passing the instances to the form to make sure our form fields are pre-populated so the user is not shown a blank form.   We are creating a dictionary by the name of context and assigning it our forms  under  keys  of  “user_form”  and  “profile_form”.  Lastly,  we  are returning the render method with the path of the template and context.  The last thing we need to do is set our LOGIN_REDIRECT setting. Our login_required needs to know where to redirect unauthenticated users. Open the setttings.py file inside the financeblog directory and add the following setting:    LOGIN_URL = "login"   The name “login” here is the name we gave our login path. It will redirect  logged-out users if they try accessing this page.    Add the following URL pattern to the urlpatterns list inside the urls.py  Profile Update URL  inside the financeblog directory:    path 'profile update', profiles_views.update, name="update" ,  Code 39 financeblog\blog\urls.py     Our updated view will now be available under the ’profile update’ path.  We gave it the name “update”.  Create a file called update.html inside the templates>profiles directory  Profile Update Template  of the profiles application and add:    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block content %}             Update                        {% csrf_token %} {{user_formcrispy}} {{profile_formcrispy}}       Submit                {% endblock content %}  Code 40 finanaceblog profiles templates profiles update.py        Everything is the same as our previous templates. The only thing different is that now we are displaying two forms. It is excellent to display more than one Django form inside a single page. Note that our HTML form also has an enctype property. This is compulsory when sending files over the form. If we don’t specify this, our image will not be sent to the view.  Before checking the form, let’s quickly link it inside the profile page. If you  remember,  the  “Update  Profile”  link  is  currently  dead.  Open  the profile.html  file  inside  the  templates>profiles  directory  of  the  profiles application and find this link:     Update Profile   Change it to the following, so it leads the user to the profile update page:   Update Profile   Now, if you open http:  localhost:8000 profile update and you should see  the following.        Figure 48 Update form  You can see all the fields are pre-populated. You can also see that both the  user  and  the  profile  forms  are  showing  just  fine.  Upon  updating  some fields and saving the form, you should be redirected to this page:     Figure 49 Profile Update Notification    Password Reset  Our  profiles  application  is  almost  complete.  The  only  thing  left  is  to create a password reset functionality so users can reset their password if they forget it. We will send the users an email that will contain a link, using which they will reset their passwords.    Setting Up SMTP Host  To send mails, we have to set up an SMTP host. We will use our Gmail account  to  send  emails  but  note  that  this  is  not  suitable  for  a  production environment.     To send mails from Gmail, you have to allow a less secure app access to your Gmail. To do this, make sure you are logged in to your Google account and visit https:  myaccount.google.com.    Click the Security setting on the left sidebar and scroll down to where it  says “Less secure app access” and turn it on.     Figure 50 Google Security  If  you  have  2-step-auth  activated,  you  need  to  create  a  new  “App Password” and use this password instead of your actual google password. It’s advised to delete the App Password after the development is finished.  Now  open  the  settings.py  file  of  your  project  and  add  the  following  settings to it:    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend' EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com' EMAIL_PORT = 587 EMAIL_USE_TLS = True EMAIL_HOST_USER='' EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=''  Code 41 financeblog\financeblog\settings.py  Let’s go over these fields:           EMAIL_BACKEND: Through this setting, we are telling that we   want  to  use  send  mails  over  SMTP.  There  are  other  options available such as a console backend or file backend. EMAIL_HOST: This setting takes the host of our SMTP. We are using Gmail. EMAIL_PORT: This is the port to use for the SMTP server. EMAIL_USE_TLS:    This  determines  whether  to  use  a  secure connection  when communicating with the SMTP server. EMAIL_HOST_USER:  This  field  will  hold  our  Gmail  email account. EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD: This field will hold the password for the Gmail account.  In simple terms, using these settings, we are telling Django that we will  be sending our mail through a Gmail account.  In   the  EMAIL_HOST_USER  and  EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD  settings, you must add your Gmail account’s email and password as strings. These will settings will use your Gmail account to send mails. I’ve added my credentials  and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, but I’m not showing them here for obvious security  reasons.  We  are  ready  to  create  the  reset  password  view  for  our profiles application.    EMAIL_HOST_USER   the   to   Password Reset Views  Django’s auth application has a password reset feature already built for us.  This  feature  uses  4  different  views  for  the  whole  process.  Open  the urls.py  file  of  the  project,  inside  the  financeblog  directory  and  add  the following URL patterns:    path 'password-reset ',  auth_views.PasswordResetView.as_view template_name="profiles password_reset.html" , name="password_reset" ,  path 'password-reset confirm    ',  auth_views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view template_name="profiles password_reset_confirm.html" name="password_reset_confirm" ,   auth_views.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view template_name="profiles password_reset_done.html" name="password_reset_done" ,  path 'password-reset done',  path 'password-reset complete',  auth_views.PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view template_name="profiles password_reset_complete.html" name="password_reset_complete" ,  Code 42 financeblog\financeblog\urls.py        The first url pattern takes the view PasswordResetView. It will show us a form where we can submit our email address. It will then send a one-time password  reset  link  to  our  email  and  redirect  us  to  another  view  that  will show a success note. Note that it will not alert us in case the entered email does not exist in our system.   The second URL pattern takes the view PasswordResetConfrm. This is the  view  that  will  actually  allow  us  to  change  our  password.  The  one-time link that is generated in the PasswordResetView is done through this view. It takes the user id encoded in base 64 and a token as its URL parameters.  The third URL pattern takes the view PasswordResetDone. This is the view  that  will  be  shown  to  the  user  once  they  submit  their  email  on  the PasswordResetView, and this view will only display a success message.  The   fourth   and   last  URL   PasswordResetComplete.  After  password, they are redirected to this page.  pattern   takes   the   the  user  successfully  changes   view their  Password Reset Templates  Create  4   files,  password_reset.html,  password_reset_confirm.html, password_reset_done.html,  password_reset_complete.html,  and  place  them inside the templates>profiles directory of the profiles application.  Our templates directory has now the following directory structure.         Open password_reset.html and add the following markup:            Password Reset   {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block content %}                           {% csrf_token %} {{formcrispy}}      Submit                {% endblock content %}        Code 43 financeblog\profiles\templates\profiles\password_reset.html  It  is  the  same  as  our  other  templates  that  display  a  form.  We  are displaying the heading “Password Reset”. Next, we are displaying the form. In password_reset_done.html, add.    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}                      {% endblock content %}  An email has been sent to you. Click the link in it to reset the password.  Code 44 financeblog\profiles\templates\profiles\password_reset_done.html  This template only displays a message to the user that they should check their email. It will be displayed once they have submitted the password reset form. In password_reset_confirm.html, add:    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block content %}             Password  Confirm?                                {% csrf_token %} {{formcrispy}}                     {% endblock content %}   Reset Password   Code 45 financeblog\profiles\templates\profiles\password_reset_confirm.html  This template, again, is the same as our password_reset.html template. Users will be taken to this template when they click on the link they receive in the password reset email. In password_reset_complete.html, add.    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}           Password Reset Successful!     Log in?          {% endblock content %}  Code 46 financeblog\profiles\templates\profiles\password_reset_complete.html  In  this  template,  we  are  displaying  that  the  user  was  able  to  reset  the  password successfully. We are also adding a link to our login page.         Speaking of which, currently, there is a “Forgot Password?” link on our login page that currently leads you nowhere. Let’s edit that so it leads you to the password reset page. Open the login.html  file inside tempates>profiles directory of the profiles application and find the following line:     Forgot Password?     Change the href so it points to our password reset view:   Forgot Password?   Testing Password Reset  Let’s test the password reset feature. Make sure you are logged out and  visit http:  localhost:8000 password_reset:    Figure 51 Password Reset form  It  works.  Enter  the  email  of  the  user,  and  it  should  lead  you  to  the         following page:          Figure 52 Password reset email sent  Now  open  your  inbox.  You  should  have  received  an  email  from  the  Gmail account you used for the SMTP server:    Figure 53 Password reset email   I’ve received the mail. On clicking the link inside the mail, it should lead  me to the following page:       Figure 54 New Password form  This is the page where we will reset the password. Change the password, and you’ll see that our password reset feature is working correctly. And the best part is that we didn’t even have to create it ourselves. We just hooked it into our project and provided our custom templates for it.   VIEWS  Now that we have a working user system on our website where users can register,  login,  log  out,  reset  the  password,  etc.  We  should  now  consider adding  more  features  to  our  blog  application.  We  will  now  add  create, update and delete  views  for  the  blog  application,  and  we  will  make  these using class-based views.  In  the  above  figure,  we  can  see  that  we  have  completed  the  up-to  user authentication part in our blog application. And we will currently do the other parts.    Generic Class Based Views  Introduction  So far, we’ve only created functional views. Django also has class-based  views. We can use either classes or functions to build our views.  Django  also  has  generic  class-based  views.  In  simple  terms,  these  are views  that  allow  us  to  do  everyday  web  development  tasks  with  very  little code as possible. Several generic class-based views are available to us, such as CreateView, which allows us to create a “create” view for a model quickly without  creating  a  form.  There  is  also  a  ListView  which  allows  us  to  list objects  of  a  model  very  quickly.  Let’s  use  these  generic  class-based  views and learn how not to code too much.     Template Naming Convention  By  default,  Django’s  generic  views  look  for  templates  under  the  path “ application   model _ viewtype .html”  where  application  refers  to  the name of the application, model refers to the name of the model we passed our generic view, and viewtype refers to the type of generic view we are creating.   However,  views  created  from  the  CreateView,  UpdateView,  and  DeleteView generic views are an exception to this naming convention.  CreateView  and  UpdateVIew  will  share  the  same  template,  and  the template name is “ model _form.html”. The “model” here is the name of the model.  We  will  pass  the  generic  view,  but  the  “form”  after  the  underscore character is literal. DeleteView template name is “ model _confirm_delete”. Model refers to the name of the model, and “_confirm_delete” are literal.  We  can  change  these  defaults  by  the  tempate_name  attribute  on  the  view. However, we will go with the default template naming convention.   Blog Create View Basic Use Case of Generic Views  Let’s create a BlogCreateView using the generic CreateView. Open the  views.py file of the blog application and add the following import:    from django.views import generic  Code 47 financeblog\blog\views.py  Next add the following code:  class BlogCreateView generic.CreateView : model = Blog fields = ['title', 'content'] def form_valid self, form :  form.instance.author = self.request.user return super  .form_valid form   Code 48 financeblog\blog\views.py            We  are  creating  a  class-based  view  that  extends  from  the  generic CreateView  class.  It  will  allow  us  to  create  a  “Create”  view  very  quickly without writing a form.  A  view  that  inherits  from  CreateView  has  two  required  attributes,  i.e., model and fields. For the model, we are assigning it Blog, and for fields, we are  assigning  it  the  title  and  content.  Note  that  we  left  out  the date_published  field  as  it  will  automatically  get  added  according  to  the model definitions. We are also not passing the author field because we want to set the currently logged-in user as the author of the blog automatically.  Next, we are overriding the form_valid method and setting the currently logged-in user  available inside the request object  as the author for the blog we are creating.  We  are  doing  it  this  way  because  currently,  the  author  is  unset  as  we didn’t pass it through the fields attribute. We didn’t pass the author through the fields attribute because it will then show the user a dropdown of users to select from like it does in the admin site. We obviously don’t want that and want to associate the current logged-in user with the author of the blog.   Currently,  anybody  can  access  this  view  whether  they  are  logged  in  or not. We also have no way to send a flash message when the blog is created. We can’t use the messages function or the login_required decorators as they are not suited for class-based views.    Extending Generic View  We will use the LoginRequiredMixin and SuccessMessageMixin mixin to fix this. Mixins are used to add additional functionalities to our class-based views. Let’s import these at the top of the views.py file.    from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin               from django.contrib.messages.views import SuccessMessageMixin  Code 49 financeblog\blog\views.py  Change the CreateBlogView, so it uses these mixins:  class BlogCreateView LoginRequiredMixin, SuccessMessageMixin, generic.CreateView : model = Blog fields = ['title', 'content'] success_message  = "Blog Created Successfully!"  def form_valid self, form :  form.instance.author = self.request.user return super  .form_valid form   Code 50 financeblog\blog\views.py  Our  BlogCreateView  is  now  inheriting  from  the  mixins  we  imported along with the CreateView. This is how you add mixins to class-based view, i.e. make your class inherit from them. We have also added a new attribute called  success_message,  which  is  the  value  that  will  be  used  to  create  the flash message when the blog is created successfully.  Let’s add this view to the urls.py file of the blog application.  Add the  following URL pattern to the urlpatterns list:    path "blog create", views.BlogCreateView.as_view  , name="blog_create"   Code 51 financeblog\blog\urls.py  This view will be available to use under the path “blog create”. Since we can’t just pass a class to a URL pattern, we pass BlogCreateView view by calling its as_view method.  Now we should add the template for this view. According to the template naming  convention  of  generic  views  we  discussed  previously,  our   BlogCreateVIew  will  look  for  its  template  under  “blog blog_form.html”. Once  again,  this  can  be  overridden,  but  we  will  stick  with  the  naming convention.  Next,  create  a  file  called  blog_form.html  that  is  in  the templates>blog directory of the blog application. Add the following code to it:    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block content %}             Blog                        {% csrf_token %} {{formcrispy}}                 {% endblock content %}   Submit   Code 52 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\blog_form.html     It is a simple form template, very similar to the templates we’ve created so  far.  The  CreateView  and  UpdateView  send  their  form  under  the  form variable to the template. It’s great that we didn’t even have to create a form ourselves as the CreateView takes care of it for us.  Let’s  test  it  out.  First,  make  sure  you  are  logged  out  and  open   http:  localhost:8000 blog create.  It  should  redirect  you  to  the  login  page. Now login and open the page again:    Figure 55 Blog Create View  It is only displaying the title and the content fields as we set in the view. When  we  submit  the  form,  it  will  set  the  currently  logged-in  user  as  the author of this blog because of the form_valid method overriding. Let’s fill the form to create a blog:     Figure 56 Blog filled up  It will show you this error page. Don’t worry, and our blog was created just  fine.  Reading  the  error  reveals  the  message  “No  URL  to  redirect  to. Either provide a URL or define a get_absolute_url method on the Model.”.  The generic CreateView will try to redirect us to the newly created model instance  on  success,  but  it  doesn’t  know  it’s  URL  path.  It  will  look  for  a method called get_absolute_url  on  the  model,  which  will  generate  a  URL for  the  detailed  view  of  the  newly  created  instance.  This  method,  by convention in Django, is used to create URLs for instances of models.  Let’s  create  the  get_absolute_url  method  on  our  Blog  model.  Open  the  models.py file of the blog application and add the following import:    from django.urls import reverse  Next, add the following method to the Blog model class:      def get_absolute_url self : return reverse "blogs_detail", kwargs={'pk': self.pk}   Code 53 financeblog\blog\models.py  The reverse function takes a URL and additional keyword arguments. If you  remember,  blogs_detail  is  the  name  of  our  detail_blog  view,  which displays the blog's detail page, and it takes a pk parameter. We are passing the  current  blog  instance’s  pk  as  the  pk  parameter  to  the  URL.  Lastly,  the reverse function will generate a URL and return it.  Let’s  test  the  create  view  again.  Create  a  view,  and  now  it  should  lead  you to its detail page:    Figure 57 Detailed View         Figure 58 Successful redirection on the detailed view  Django successfully redirected us to the detail page of the newly created  blog. It also shows our flash message. Blog Update View   Let’s create an update view of our blog. We only want the author of the blog to be able to update it. Any user that tries to access the update page of a blog they are not the author of will be shown a “Forbidden” page  HTTP Status: 403 .  Add the import to the views.py file of the blog application:  from django.contrib.auth.mixins import UserPassesTestMixin    Add the following code to create the update view for our blog:           class   BlogUpdateView LoginRequiredMixin,   UserPassesTestMixin,   SuccessMessageMixin, generic.UpdateView :  model = Blog fields = ['title', 'content'] success_message  = "Blog Updated Successfully!"  def form_valid self, form :  form.instance.author = self.request.user return super  .form_valid form   def test_func self :  blog = self.get_object   if self.request.user == blog.author:  else:  return True  return False  Code 54 financeblog\blog\views.py     This view is the same as our BlogCreateView except for three changes. First,  it  inherits  from  UpdateView  instead  of  CreateView.  The  difference between the two is that the UpdateView will be expecting a pk parameter in its URL pattern for identifying a model instance that we will be changing. It will be updating an instance instead of creating a new one.  The  second  change  is  that  we  are  now  adding  another  mixin, UserPassesTestMixin, to our update view. Using this mixin, we can add a conditional pass to only allow access to this view if the currently logged-in user is the author of this blog.   Third and last change is the test_func method. This method is where you put  the  conditional  pass  for  the  UserPassesTestMixin.  In  it,  we  are  first fetching the current blog that we are updating. Next, we are checking whether the current user is the author of the blog. If our current user is the author, we return  True  to  indicate  that  it  is  okay  to  allow  access,  else  it  will  restrict access.  Let’s add the URL pattern for this view. Open the urls.py file of the blog  application and add the following URL pattern to the URL pattern list:         path 'blog   update', views.BlogUpdateView.as_view  , name="blog_update"   UpdateView  requires  a  pk  parameter  in  the  URL  pattern,  and  we  are  passing that. We have given our blog update view the name blog_update.   Both  the  CreateView  and  UpdateView  generic  views  use  the  same template, so we don’t have to create a template for our BlogUpdateView as it will use the template for the BlogCreateView.  Now to test it out, visit http:  localhost:8000 blog 6 update. Note that “6” here is the pk of one of my blogs. If you enter a random pk in the URL and no blog exists matching that pk, it will show a 404 error.    Figure 59 Blog Updating   Figure 60 Blog Update successful  You can see that it showed us the form, and it was prepopulated with our existing  data.  The  flash  message  is  also  saying  that  it  was  updated successfully Blog Delete Generic Delete View  Users should be able to delete their blogs. Let’s add a delete view. Open  the views.py file of the blog application and add the following code:    class BlogDeleteView LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin, generic.DeleteView : model = Blog success_message  = "Blog Deleted Successfully!" success_url = " "  def test_func self :  blog = self.get_object   if self.request.user == blog.author:  else:  return True  return False   def delete self, request, *args, **kwargs :  messages.success self.request, self.success_message  return super BlogDeleteView, self .delete request, *args, **kwargs   Code 55 financeblog\blog\views.py     Our  BlogDeleteView  extends  from  the  generic  DeleteView.  The  only required value for views that extend from DeleteView is the model attribute. We are ensuring that only the author of the blog can delete the blog through the UserPassesTestMixin.  If  you  noticed,  we  are  not  using  the  SuccessMessageMixin  in  our BlogDeleteView. The SuccessMessageMixin works by hooking itself on the form_valid,  but  the  form_valid  method  is  not  present  in  the  generic DeleteVIew, so it will not work.  type   flash  message  of   That  is  why  we  are  overriding  BlogDeleteView’s  delete  method  and sending  a  it self.success_message,  which  refers  to  the  success_message  attribute  we created on BlogDetailView class. Note that we are only overriding the delete method because we want to show a flash message. This is not required by the DeleteView. Since we are using the messages  object,  make  sure  you  don’t forget to import it:    success.  We  are  passing   from django.contrib import messages  Let’s add BlogDeleteView’s  URL  pattern.  Open  the  urls.py  file  of  the  blog application and add the following URL pattern to the urlpatterns list:    path 'blog   delete', views.BlogDeleteView.as_view  , name="blog_delete" ,    Delete Confirmation Template  As per the template naming convention we discussed earlier, it will look   for  a  file  called  blog_confirm_delete.html  as  it’s  template.  Open  the templates>blogs  directory  of  the  blog  application  and  create  a  file  called blog_confirm_delete.html. Add the following content to it:    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block content %}               {% csrf_token %}    me back                {% endblock content %}   Are you sure you want to delete  the  blog  " {{object.title}} "?   Yes please.   No,  take  Code 56 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\blog_confirm_delete.html  BlogDeleteView view will display a confirmation page on a GET request, i.e. opening the delete page. It will only delete the instance if we perform a POST request against it.  We are sending an empty form with only the csrf_token template tag. If we  press  the  “Yes  please.”  button,  it  will  perform  a  POST  request  on  the same URL, and our BlogDeleteView will then delete the blog instance. Let’s delete a view to test it out. Open http:  localhost:8000 blog 6 delete:        Figure 61 Deleting The blog  Blog List View Generic List View  Currently, we have the view list_blogs in the blog application that lists all the  available  blogs.  We  will  use  the  generic  ListView  to  do  this  instead. Open  the  views.py  file  of  the  blog  application  and  remove  the  existing list_blogs and replace it with the following view:    class BlogListView generic.ListView : model = Blog ordering = ['-date_published'] paginate_by = 3  Code 57 financeblog\blog\views.py  We  are  creating  a  BlogListView  view  that  extends  from  the  generic   ListView.  The  only  required  attribute  for  the  ListView  is  the  model.  We have added an ordering attribute to order the queryset of blogs by the most recent blog created through the date_published field. Next, we are adding an attribute called paginate_by. This will add pagination to our view and will only show up to 3 blogs at a time. Also, note that we aren’t using any mixins as we want all users to view the home page where we will list all the blogs.  Remember, just updating the view in views.py is not enough. We need to tell the “dispatcher” where to find the new view  and remove the pointer to the  old  view .  Let’s  add  this  generic  view  to  the  urls.py  file  of  our  blog application.  Find  the  following  URL  pattern,  which  currently  uses  our  old list_blog view:    path "", views.list_blogs, name="blog_list" ,  Change it to use our new BlogListView:  path "", views.BlogListView.as_view  , name="blog_list"   List View Template  Keeping the naming convention of generic views we discussed earlier in template  under  look   for   mind,  and  our  BlogListVIew  will  “blog blog_list.html”.  its   Now  remove  the  existing  list.html  template  in  the  templates>blog directory  of  the  blog  application  and  create  blog_list.html  file.  Add  the following code to it:    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}               Finance  blogs  to  help  you  succeed.                {% if object_list.count > 0 %} {% for blog in object_list %}          mb-2"   style="background-  <div   class="mugshot-img   image:url {{blog.author.profile.image.url}} ">    {{blog.author.username}}      {{blog.date_publisheddate:"d m Y h:i a"}}    {{blog.title}}   {{blog.contenttruncatewords:30}}  <a  href="{%  url  'blogs_detail'  blog.pk  %}"  class="font-weight-bold  mb-3  d-inline-  {% if request.user.is_authenticated and request.user == blog.author  %}  Update   Delete  {% endif %}         block">  Read More                  {% endfor %}       {% if page_obj.has_previous %}      {% endif %}      {% if page_obj.has_next %}     « first   previous   Page {{ page_obj.number }} of {{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages }}.    next   last »     {% else %}  It's pretty lonely to have no blogs on a blogging site   Add  a  blog?  <a  href="{%  url  'blog_create'    {% endif %}     %}">Click here   {% endif %}    {% endblock content %}  Code 58 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\blog_list.html  Our new blog_list.html template is quite similar to the list.html template we previously used, but we’ve added more content to this one. We are now displaying the image of the author as well as a link to their profile. Note that the  blog  has  an  author  field  which  is  a  User.  The  User  has  a  one  to  one relationship  with  the  Profile  model.  Since  these  are  all  related,  we  can retrieve  data  of  related  models  pretty  easily  by  treating  them  as  python objects like “{{blog.user.profile.image.url}}”.  We have also added a link to the update and delete a view of the blogs. These will only be shown if the current user viewing the site is the author of the blog because of the conditional we added.  Next, we have added the code for the pagination, which is available under page_obj variable. Using it, we are displaying the current pagination page we are  on  by  the  page_obj.number.  We  are  then  adding  two  conditionals  to check if there is a “next” or “previous” pagination page.  Lastly, we have added a conditional on adding a message if there are no blogs  int  the  database.  The  queryset  sent  to  the  templates  in  views  created from ListView generic view is called object_list. Open http:  localhost:8000      Figure 62 Object List        Figure 63 Single Blog  It looks perfect now. Clicking on the image or the username will lead you   to the profile page. The pagination is working correctly. In this view, I chose to  only  display  up  to  3  blogs  per  page,  and  you  can  see  that  it  works  as expected.  The  update  and  delete  buttons  are  clickable  because  the  current logged-in user created these blogs. If you log out and visit the page as guest or another user, you will see that the buttons are no longer visible.    Figure 64 Logged Out View  Blog Detail View Generic Detail View  In the 2nd  chapter, we created the detail view for blogs with the name detail_blog.  Let’s  use  the  generic DetailView  to  create  it  instead.  Remove the detail_blog view from the views.py file of the blog application and create a new view.    class BlogDetailView generic.DetailView : model = Blog   The  model  attribute  is  required  by  views  inheriting  from  the  generic DetailView. This is all the code we need - isn’t it awesome? Let’s add this view to a URL pattern inside the urls.py file of the blog application. Find the following URL pattern which uses our old detail_blog:    path "blog  ", views.detail_blog, name="blogs_detail"   Now change it so it uses our BlogDetailView:  path "blog  ", views.BlogDetailView.as_view  , name="blogs_detail" ,  Code 59 financeblog\profiles\views.py        The BlogDetailView expects a pk parameter, passed in the request from  the URL, so we’ve added that here.    Template for Generic Detail View   According to the naming convention for generic views, BlogDetailView will  look  for  it’s  template  under  “blog blog_detail.html”.  Remove  the  old detail.html  inside  templates>blog  directory  of  the  blog  application  and create a new file called blog_detail.html. Add the following code to it:    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}            <div   class="mugshot-img   mb-2"   style="background-  image:url {{blog.author.profile.image.url}} ">   {{blog.author.username}}       {{blog.date_publisheddate:"d m Y h:i a"}}         {{blog.title}}  {% if request.user == blog.author %}         Update   Delete   {% endif %}                 {% endblock content %}       {{blog.content}}   Code 60 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\blog_detail.html     This  template  is  not  much  different  from  the  detail.html  we  used previously for the blog detail page. We are now displaying the author image and adding a link to their profile. We have also added the update and delete button, but these will only be shown if the current user viewing the template is the author of the blog. This is how it’ll look now:    Figure 65 Detailed blog view   Blog Content Length  There is currently a problem with our blog model. There is no minimum word limit for our blog. A user can create a blog that only says “hello” in the body.    Figure 66 Any length allowable  This is bad as no blogs are only one word long. We need to verify that the  content of the blog is at least 300 characters long.  We can do it at the form level or the model level. If we do it at the form level, the admin will still post blogs less than 300 characters long from the admin site or the shell.  That is why we will add this validation to our model. Before we make this change, delete all the existing blogs so we can start fresh. Best do it from the admin site.        Figure 67 Adding validation  After  deleting  all  the  blogs,  opening  the  homepage  should  display  a  slightly depressive but encouraging message.              Figure 68 No blog in a site message  If you remember, we added a condition in the blog_list.html to display this  message  if  no  blogs  are  found  where  object_list  is  a  list  full  of  Blog Objects.     It's  pretty  lonely  to  have  no  blogs  on  a  blogging  {% if object_list.count > 0 %} ... {% else %}  site   ... {% endif %}  Code 61 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\blog_list.html  Blog Content Length Validator  Now  we  are  ready  to  make  the  changes.  Close  the  development  server and  open  the  models.py  file  of  the  blog  application.  Import  the  following validation function:    from django.core.validators import MinLengthValidator    Now add the following code before defining the Blog model class:  content_validator  =  MinLengthValidator limit_value=300,  message="Content  should  be  at  least  300 characters long!"   Code 62 financeblog\blog\models.py  MinLengthValidator  takes  two  parameters,  limit_value  and  message. We are creating a validator and setting the minimum character limit to 300. We are also adding a message to display in case the validation fails. We are storing  this  validator  inside  the  content_validator  variable.    Now  add  the   content_validator to the content attribute of the model:    content = models.TextField validators=[content_validator]   Our  content  field  will  now  use  this  validator.  After  making  the  above  changes, your models.py file should look like this:    from django.db import models from django.utils import timezone from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.urls import reverse from django.core.validators import MinLengthValidator  content_validator = MinLengthValidator limit_value=300, message="Content should be at  least 300 characters long!"   class Blog models.Model : title = models.CharField max_length=250  content = models.TextField validators=[content_validator]  date_published = models.DateTimeField default=timezone.now  author = models.ForeignKey User, on_delete=models.CASCADE  def __str__ self :  return self.title  def get_absolute_url self :  return reverse "blogs_detail", kwargs={'pk': self.pk}   Code 63 financeblog\blog\models.py        Now  that  we  have  altered  a  field  on  the  model,  we  need  to  run  the  migrations. Run the makemigrations command:    Terminal   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>python manage.py makemigrations Migrations for 'blog':  blog\migrations\0002_auto_20201218_1938.py - Alter field content on blog  It created migrations. Now we need to run the migrate command to push  these model changes to our blog schema in the database:            Terminal   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>python manage.py migrate Operations to perform:  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, blog, contenttypes, profiles, sessions  Running migrations:   Applying blog.0002_auto_20201218_1938...

Try  creating  a  blog  and  no  providing enough words  for the  title, you’ll  see  an error  message like  the one  on  the following Figure. Form Validation: Check!      server   and   Figure 69 Validation rule on blog creation  Blog Creation link  One final touch before moving on to the next Chapter. Currently, there is no  link  on  our  website  that  leads  to  the  blog  creation  page.  Open  the   base.html  template  inside  the  templates>blog  directory  of  the  blog application and replace the html header tag with the code below:    html           My Financial Blog  <button   class="navbar-toggler"   data-toggle="collapse"   type="button"   data-  aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent"   aria-expanded="false"   aria-label="Toggle  target="navbarSupportedContent"  navigation">            Write a Blog                {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}     Profile    Logout          {% else %}           {% endif %}                Login    Register   Code 64 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\base.html     We’ve only added one new link, but just for simplicity’s sake and so you know where to put the link, we are showing the full header tag. Your navbar   should now have a minimalistic looking “Write a Blog” button.       Figure 70  Availability of the button "Write a blog."   ADVICE  Our  website  is  complete.  Users  can  register,  upload  images  and descriptions about themselves. Users can post blogs and update delete their own blogs. They cannot update delete blogs of other users.  It’s time we add the advice section. We will now add a feature so users can post a question, and others can provide their advice. We will also look at how to create a REST API using the Django Rest Framework.   Advice Application  You  know  the  drill,  close  the  development  server  and  create  a  new application by the name of advice. Before you read any further, if you are sitting  in  front  of  your  Machine,  try  and  do  it  yourself.  Use  the  “help” command in “python manage.py” if necessary.      MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>python manage.py startapp advice  Terminal  Make sure to add it to the INSTALLED_APPS setting in the settings.py  file inside the financeblog directory:    INSTALLED_APPS = [ 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'blog', 'profiles', 'crispy_forms', 'advice' ]   Question and Answer Schema  Our  advice  applications  will  have  two  models,  Question  and  Advice. There  will  be  a  one-to-many  relation  between  the  two,  i.e.  a  question  can have much advice, but advice can only belong to a single question.    Figure 71 One to Many relationships between question and advice     Our Question and Advice models will also share a one-to-many relation with the User model. Open the models.py file of the advice application and add the following code:    from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.utils import timezone from django.urls import reverse  class Question models.Model :   title = models.CharField max_length=500  author = models.ForeignKey User, on_delete=models.CASCADE  date_published = models.DateTimeField default=timezone.now   def __str__ self :  return self.title  class Advice models.Model : content = models.TextField   author = models.ForeignKey User, on_delete=models.CASCADE  question = models.ForeignKey Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE  date_published = models.DateTimeField default=timezone.now   def __str__ self :  return f"Advice by {self.author.username}"  Code 65 financeblog\profiles\models.py  Let’s go over the the field Question model first.  title: It is a CharField with a max_length of 500. author: It is a ForeignKey which means that question shares a one-to-many  the  User  model.

Our Schema is written down. It it isn’t reflected in the Database though. Remember, in order for these fields to go from Python Code to SQL Fields inside a PostgreSQL Server, we need to generate and run the migrations.

OK  Registering Models in the Admin site  Open  the  admin.py  file  inside  the  advice  application  and  register  the Question and Advice model we just created. If your site is going to have a lot of Models and you want them All to be in the Admin Panel, you might as well  write  a  simple  Python  script,  that  will  import  all  Classes  from  the models.py files and pass them into admin.site.register as Array.    from django.contrib import admin from .models import Question, Advice admin.site.register Question  admin.site.register Advice    Code 66 financeblog\profiles\admin.py     You can also pass a list of Models to the admin.site.register  . Open the admin  site  at  http:  localhost:8000 admin,  and  you  should  now  see  the Question and Advice.    Figure 72 Question and advice view in Admin side  You can try adding or deleting the Question and Advice instances.  We  will now begin creating class-based generic views for the Question model. Views Question Create View  Let’s start by creating the create view of our Question model. Add the  following code to the views.py file of the advice application:    from django.views import generic   from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin from django.contrib.messages.views import SuccessMessageMixin from .models import Question  class   QuestionCreateView LoginRequiredMixin,   SuccessMessageMixin,  generic.CreateView : model = Question fields = ['title'] success_message  = "Question Created Successfully!"  def form_valid self, form :  form.instance.author = self.request.user return super  .form_valid form   Code 67 financeblog\profiles\views.py  We have created a view called QuestionCreateView that extends from CreateView  generic  view.  It  is  the  same  as  our  BlogCreateView.  We  are the  fields  attribute.  We  are  also  using passing  LoginRequriedMixin  and  SuccessMessageMixin.  There  is  nothing  new here. Let’s create the URL pattern for our QuestionCreateView.  the  field  title   in   First  create  the  urls.py  file  inside  the  advice  application  and  add  the  following code to it:    from django.urls import path from . import views urlpatterns = [ path 'create ', views.QuestionCreateView.as_view  , name="question_create" , ]  Code 68 financeblog\financeblog\urls.py     Now  let’s  add  the  URL  patterns  of  our  advice  application  inside  the urls.py file of the project. Add the following pattern inside the URL patterns list in the urls.py file of financeblog directory:    path 'questions ', include 'advice.urls'     It means our QuestionCreateView view will be available under the path “questions create”. We have linked the urls.py file of our advice application with the URL patterns of the project. As per the naming convention of the generic  class-based  views,  QuestionCreateView  will  look  for  its  template under “advice question_form.html”.  Let’s start by creating the directories for the templates. Inside the advice application,  create  a  directory  called  templates,  and  inside  the  templates directory create a directory called advice. Inside the advice directory create a file  called  question_form.html.  After  making  the  changes,  the  templates directory  of  the  advice  application  should  have  the  following  directory structure:    Add the following code to question_form.html:     {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block content %}              Have a Question?                          {% csrf_token %} {{formcrispy}}       Submit                {% endblock content %}  Code 69 financeblog\advice\templates\advice\question_form.html  This code is the same as our blog_form.html template. We’ve just copied and  pasted  that  same  code.  The  only  thing  we’ve  changed  is  the  heading which  now  says,  “Have  a  question?”.  Let’s  it  by  visiting http:  localhost:8000 questions create.    test   Figure 73 Question submission form         Figure 74 Error from the Question Model     This  error  was  expected  as  we’ve  not  created  the  get_absolute_url method on the Question model yet. Our question was saved successfully, and you can verify it through the admin site.     Figure 75 Question generated in the admin side  Since we don’t have a detailed view of the Question model yet, we will  postpone creating the get_absolute_url when we create the detail view.  Question Update View  We will not be creating an updated view of the questions. Suppose a user posted a question and others offer their advice. After some users have posted their advice, the question's original poster updates the question so now. It is asking  something  entirely  different.  The  answers  provided  on  the  question page will not make any sense. Therefore, we will not be creating an update page for the question.   The  admin  will  still  be  able  to  make  changes  through  the  admin  site. Besides, you have bravely made it until this Chapter. So you know very well how to create your own  generic  Update View.    Inside views.py of the advice application, add the following import:  Question Delete View     from django.contrib import messages  Now add the following code:  class   QuestionDeleteView LoginRequiredMixin,   UserPassesTestMixin,  generic.DeleteView : model = Question success_message  = "Question Deleted Successfully!" success_url = " questions"  def test_func self :  question = self.get_object   if self.request.user == question.author:  return True   else:  return False  def delete self, request, *args, **kwargs :  messages.success self.request, self.success_message  return super QuestionDeleteView, self .delete request, *args, **kwargs   Code 70 financeblog\advice\views.py  This view is the same as our BlogDeleteView. The only difference is that we are now passing the Question model. Using the UserPassesTestMixin, we are ensuring that only the author of the question can delete it. Note that we  are  redirecting  to  a  path  “ questions”  which  is  where  we  will  list  our questions.  It  currently  doesn’t  exist  to  get  a  404  page  after  you  delete  a question and are redirected.  Let’s create a URL pattern for our QuestionDeleteView. Open the urls.py file  of  the  advice  application  and  add  the  following  URL  pattern  to  the urlpatterns list:    path '  delete', views.QuestionDeleteView.as_view  , name="question_delete" ,  Our  QuestionDeleteView  will  look  for  a  template  by  the  name question_confirm_delete.html.  Let’s  add  it.  Inside  the  templates>advice directory  called file  question_confirm_delete.html  and add the following markup to it:    application,   advice   add   the   of   a   {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block content %}                {% csrf_token %}     Yes please.   No, take me back    Are you sure you want to delete the question " {{object.title}} "?                {% endblock content %}  Code 71 financeblog\advice\templates\advice\question_confirm_delete.html     Again,  we’ve  just  copy-pasted  the  blog_confirm_delete.html  template. Note that the “No, take me back” link doesn’t take you anywhere as we have yet to create the detail page of the question.    Figure 76 Delete view of the questions  Question Detail View  If you remember, the generic detail View is among the most complex and hard to remember views. Add the following code to the views.py file of the advice application.     class QuestionDetailView generic.DetailView : model = Question  Open  urls.py  file  of  the  advice  application.  Add  the  following  URL  pattern to the urlpatterns list:    path '  ', views.QuestionDetailView.as_view  , name="question_detail" ,  By  naming  convention,  QuestionDetailView  will  look  for  its  template under “advice question_detail.html”. Inside the templates>advice directory of the advice application, create a file called question_detail.html. Insert the following code.    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}             <div   class="mugshot-img   mb-2"   style="background-  image:url {{question.author.profile.image.url}} ">    {{question.author.username}}      {{question.date_publisheddate:"d m Y h:i a"}}               Q:         {{question.title}}        {% if request.user == question.author %}    Delete     {% endif %}          {% endblock content %}               Code 72 financeblog\advice\templates\advice\question_detail.html  This template is very similar to the blog_detail.html. We have changed some  styling  here  and  there  and  are  displaying  the  question  title, date_publsihed,  and  the  author's  information.  We’ve  also  added  the  delete button, which links to the delete page of this question. Note that it will only be  shown  if  the  current  logged  in  user  is  the  author  of  the  question.  Open http:  localhost:8000 questions 1.    Figure 77 Single question view  Let’s add a link for this view inside our question_confirm_delete.html. Open  question_confirm_delete.html  and  find  where  it  says  “No,  take  me back”.     No, take me back   Change the href, so it now points to our detail page:   No, take me back                Code 73 financeblog\advice\templates\advice\question_confirm_delete.html  Let’s also create the get_absolute_url method now that we have a detail page  for  the  question  model.  Open  the  models.py  file  of    the  advice application and the following method to the Question class:    def get_absolute_url self :  return reverse "question_detail", kwargs={'pk': self.pk}   Code 74 financeblog\advice\models.py  We  are  creating  the  URL  using  the  reverse  function.  Creating  a  new  question should redirect us to its detail page now.    Question List View  Open views.py file of the advice application and add the following code:  class QuestionListView generic.ListView : model = Question paginate_by = 3 ordering = ['-date_published']  Code 75 financeblog\advice\views.py  We  have  created  the  QuestionListView  by  extending  from  the  generic ListView.  Just  like  we  did  in  BlogListView,  we  are  also  adding  the pagination  and  ordering  attributes  to  the  QuestionListView.  Open  the urls.py file of the advice application and add the following URL pattern to the URL patterns list.  path '',views.QuestionListView.as_view  ,name="question_list" ,  Our  QuestionListView  view  will  be  available  under  the  “questions ”   path. It will look for a template by the name of “question_list.html”.  Add a file  called  question_list.html  to  the  templates>advice  directory  inside  the advice application and insert the following code.           Help  others  succeed  in  {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}       finance.                {% if object_list.count > 0 %} {% for question in object_list %}          <div   class="mugshot-img   mb-2"   style="background-  image:url {{question.author.profile.image.url}} ">    {{question.author.username}}      {{question.date_publisheddate:"d m Y h:i a"}}    {{question.title}}  <a  href="{%  url  'question_detail'  question.pk  %}"  class="font-weight-bold  mb-3  d-  {% if request.user.is_authenticated and request.user == question.author  %} <a  class="btn  btn-sm  btn-danger"  href="{%  url   'question_delete'  question.pk         inline-block">  Read Thread       %}">Delete   {% endif %}             {% endfor %}        {% if page_obj.has_previous %}     « first   previous     {% endif %}      {% if page_obj.has_next %}      {% endif %}     Page {{ page_obj.number }} of {{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages }}.   next   last »     {% else %}  No queries posted yet...   Ask a question? <a href="{% url 'question_create'  %}">Click here    {% endif %}    {% endblock content %}  Code 76 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\blog_list.html  Again, this code layout is the same as our blog_list.html template. We’ve only  changed  the  variables  to  match  the  question.  We’ve  changed  a  few things,  i.e.  changed  the  main  heading  and  changed  the  question  title's  size. Everything else, as you can see, is pretty much boilerplate. Meaning, you can use  the  wording.  Open http:  localhost:8000 questions.    it  for  other  List  Views  -  simply  adjust       Figure 78 Word adjustment  Let’s update the navigation bar while we are at it. Open the base.html file inside  the  templates  >  blog  directory  of  the  blog  application  and  find  the HTML header code. Find the last    and {% endif %} tag. Insert another link after the endif-condition.      ... {% endif %}    Browse Questions    ...    Code 77 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\base.html  We have added two new links to create a question and one link that takes  you to the QuestionListView page.     Figure 79 New button added for asking a question  Testing Question Views of   create   views   Let’s   the   http:  localhost:8000 questions create    the  Question  models.  Open   Figure 80 View for the question model  After creating the question, you should be redirected to its detail page.     Figure 81 Question created successfully   Let’s delete this question.        Figure 82 Question delete view  If you press the “No, Take me back” button, you’ll be taken back to the detail page. If you delete the question, you will be redirected to the question list page.     Figure 83 Question deleted successfully   REST API - DRF  Decoupling Backend & Frontend  Introduction  Say, for our web app, you build a mobile application. You want to display all  the  questions  on  our  website,  but  how  will  you  get  data  from  the  web application?  The  mobile  application  and  web  application  are  two  different applications and are not connected in any way. You can scrap the site. You can  directly  connect  with  the  database  but  will  need  to  build  an  additional backend for processing the data. These or several different methods which are all hacky ways to get the data.  Enter REST APIs. We can create a REST API in our web application that will return the questions on our web application in a JSON format. Let’s say we created the API on the path “ questions api all”.  Now, suppose you perform an HTTP GET request against this endpoint. In  that  case,  it  doesn’t  matter  if  you  are  on  a  browser,  or  performing  the request through the curl terminal command, or performing the HTTP request through AJAX. You will always get the data back in JSON format. This way, we can expose our application's data straightforwardly, so it is available to other platforms.     REST  APIs  allow  us  to  build  URL  endpoints  that  will  return  or  accept data in a universal format, usually JSON. We will not go into the jargon as REST is a topic of its own, but we will briefly explain it to give you an idea.    Our Use Case  We will create two views for the Advice model, allowing users to create advice  for  a  question  and  list  all  of  the  advice  for  a  given  question.  Both create  and  list  views  of  advice  will  be  displayed  on  the  detail  page  of  the Question model. However, we don’t want to build these the traditional way.  Suppose you go to any modern website which has a comment system. In that  case,  you  will  notice  that  your  comment  gets  added  without  the  page reloading.  This creates a pleasant user experience as the page doesn’t reload, and the user can keep doing what they were doing. You must also have noticed that the comment section is loaded on some websites when you scroll down to it, meaning it fetches data in real-time from the server. This instant feedback on the action is very welcomed by users and is pretty much status quo today.  AJAX & Django Views   This is all done by performing HTTP requests through AJAX calls on the page or, more specifically, the API. These HTTP requests are made to URL endpoints  accepting  and  returning  data  in  JSON  instead  of  HTML documents. We need to build some kind of API on our web application that will allow the user to retrieve the advice of a question in JSON format and send  JSON  data  to  an  Endpoint.  This  Endpoint  will  create  the  specified advice for a particular question.   Django Rest Framework  DRF  Why DRF?  To  create  REST  APIs,  we  will  utilize  the  Django  REST  Framework  DRF . DRF allows us to implement REST in a Django project very quickly. It  comes  with  a  set  of  valuable  features  we  otherwise  would  have  to implement ourselves. It is used inside a Django Project, i.e., it doesn’t work standalone.  It  offers  various  features  such  as  views,  generic  views, authentication, serialization, browsable API, and a lot more.   It also comes with very in-depth documentation that covers every topic in detail.  We  will  only  be  scratching  the  DRF's  surface  in  our  project.  It  is  a complete framework dedicated to only creating REST APIs in Django.    Installing Django Rest Framework  Close the development server and install the Django rest framework.  Terminal     the project.   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>pip install djangorestframework  Next, add it to the INSTALLED_APP setting in the settings.py file of  INSTALLED_APPS = [   'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'blog', 'profiles', 'crispy_forms', 'advice', 'rest_framework' ]  Creating Advice List View  Open views.py of the advice application and add the following imports.     from .models import Advice from rest_framework.views import APIView from rest_framework.response import Response from rest_framework.reverse import reverse from django.utils import formats  Code 78 financeblog\advice\views.py  Now we’ll create a View, similar to the Views we created earlier.  class AdviceListView APIView : def get self, request, pk=None :  queryset = Advice.objects.all  .filter question_id=pk .order_by "-date_published"  data_to_return = []  for advice in queryset:  username = advice.author.username user_url = request.build_absolute_uri reverse 'profile', args=[advice.author.pk]   user_image = request.build_absolute_uri advice.author.profile.image.url  content = advice.content date_published   formats.date_format advice.date_published,  =   "SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT"   instance = {  'username' : username, 'user_url': user_url, 'user_image': user_image, 'content': content, 'date_published': date_published   } data_to_return.append instance   return Response data_to_return   Code 79 financeblog\advice\views.py        We are creating the AdviceListView view that extends from django-rest- framework’s APIView. This view will respond to GET requests only. That is why  we  only  have  a  get  method.  If  we  want  to  perform  actions  on  other HTTP calls such as POST or DELETE to this view, we will have to create a class method by the name of the HTTP request type, which will handle the code of that scenario.     We are passing three parameters to the get method, i.e., self, request, and pk. Our view will get the pk parameter through the URL. Next, we have this line of code.    queryset = Advice.objects.all  .filter question_id=pk .order_by "-date_published"   We are retrieving all the instances of the Advice model that belong to a particular question. We are filtering that question by its id and passing the pk parameter  we  received  as  the  matching  query.  Next,  we  are  ordering  the queryset  result  by  the date_published field.  the  most  recent  advice  published   through   We are creating an empty list by the name data_to_return and looping over the queryset we just made. We are then retrieving some data, and these are:    username = advice.author.username  We are storing the username of the author of the advice.   user_url = request.build_absolute_uri reverse 'profile', args=[advice.author.pk]     We  are  creating  a  URL  for  the  profile  of  the  author  with  the  reverse method.  We  are  passing  ‘profile’,  which  is  the  name  of  the  user’s  profile URL. We are passing it the pk of the author of the advice as well so it knows which user we are talking about. Lastly, we are wrapping the reverse method inside the build_absolute_uri method, which will create the full absolute URL as reverse only creates a partial relative URL.    user_image = request.build_absolute_uri advice.author.profile.image.url   Here we are creating the URL link of the author’s profile image. We are  building it the same way we did in the previous step.    content = advice.content     We are storing the content of the advice instance.  date_published = formats.date_format advice.date_published, "SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT"   We  are  storing  the  date_published  field  of  the  advice  instance  but  by default,  it  will  return  in  a  different  format.  We  are  wrapping  it  inside  the date_format  the ‘SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT’ format.    that  we  want   specifying   function   and   instance = {  'username' : username, 'user_url': user_url, 'user_image': user_image, 'content': content, 'date_published': date_published  }  In this piece of code, we are creating an instance of the advice we want to send  back  through  the  URL.  It  is  a  python  dictionary,  and  it  holds  all  the variables we just created.    data_to_return.append instance      Lastly, we are appending the instance dictionary to the data_to_return list we created earlier. Remember that we were looping over the queryset, so it will create this instance for all the advice the queryset has.    return Response data_to_return   Finally, we are sending the data back through the Response method. Note that this Response method will automatically convert our python dictionary to a JSON object.    Advice List View URL Pattern  Let’s create a URL pattern for our AdviceListView. Open the urls.py file of  the  advice  application  and  add  the  following  URL  pattern  to  the  URL patterns list.    path 'api  ', views.AdviceListView.as_view   ,    Code 80 financeblog\advice\urls.py  Remember, our view was using a pk for querying a specific question. It  will get that parameter from our URL.  Advice List View Testing  Visit the Question section in the admin site and add a new question.      Figure 84 Question section in the admin site  Let’s also add a few advice to this question through the admin site.     Figure 85 Adding new advice   the   Note   id  of   just  created  and  visit http:  localhost:8000 questions api 3.  Note  that  “3”  here  refers  to  the  pk  of the question we just created.    the  question  you   Figure 86 Django template provided by rest-framework  This template is provided by the django-rest-framework and is very good for development purposes because we can interact with the API graphically. You will want to disable this in production to only show raw JSON data.  You  can  see  that  our  AdviceListView  view  is  returning  the  data correctly. It is in JSON format. We are sending the username, user_image and user_url because we want to display the information of the advice author as well.  Note that this is a public API, meaning anyone can access this data. We don’t want to protect this route as we want unauthenticated users to also be able to read comments on our web application.   Advice Create Serializer What is Serializer?  Serializers convert data from JSON to python objects called serializing   and from python objects to JSON called de-serializing .       Figure 87 Serialization De-Serialization mechanism  They work very similarly to Django forms as we create our serializers by inheriting from either Serializer or ModelSerializer classes. We then define attributes on our serializer class and specify what sort of data that attribute should expect, i.e., whether it will be an email or a CharField etc.    The only difference between the Serializer and ModelSerializer class is that ModelSerializer class allows us to build a serializer based on a model that we pass it, kind of like we did in forms extending from ModelForm.  Create Serializer  the following code to it:    Create a file called serializers.py inside the advice application and add  from rest_framework import serializers from .models import Advice  class AdviceCreateSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer : class Meta:  model = Advice fields = ['content']   Code 81 financeblog\advice\serializers.py  This serializer will expect one field only, content. The advice model also has  the  author,  question,  and  date_published  fields,  but  we  will  handle those in the view.    Creating Advice Create View  Open the views.py  file  of  the  advice  application  and  add  the  following  imports.           from rest_framework import status from .serializers import AdviceCreateSerializer  Code 82 financeblog\advice\views.py  Next, add the following code for the view:   class AdviceCreateView APIView : def post self, request, pk=None :  if request.user.is_authenticated:  serializer = AdviceCreateSerializer data=request.data  if serializer.is_valid  : user = request.user try:  question = Question.objects.get pk=pk   except Question.DoesNotExist:  Response {"error"  exist!"},status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST   return   :   "Question   does   not  advice  =  Advice.objects.create content=serializer.validated_data["content"],  author=user , question=question   advice.save   data_to_return = {  "username": advice.author.username, "user_url": reverse 'profile', args=[advice.author.pk], request=request , "user_image":request.build_absolute_uri advice.author.profile.image.url , "content": advice.content, "date_published":formats.date_format advice.date_published,  "SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT"   }   return Response data_to_return, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED   return Response status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST       else:  else:  return Response status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED   Code 83 financeblog\advice\views.py  We have created a view called AdviceCreatView that extends from the APIView. Notice that we are now defining a post method, not a get. That is because this view will only accept POST HTTP requests. We are passing the pk parameter to the view, and we will get this from the URL.   Inside the view body, The first thing we check is whether the user posting data is authenticated or not. If the user is not logged in, we are returning an HTTP 401 error.  We  have  created  an  instance  of  the  AdviceCreateSerializer  and  are  passing the data from the request.    serializer = AdviceCreateSerializer data=request.data   Next, we are calling the is_valid and checking if the user-submitted data is valid or not. If the data is not valid, we are returning an HTTP 404 error. If the form is valid, we execute the following code.    user = request.user try: question = Question.objects.get pk=pk  except Question.DoesNotExist: return  Response {"error"   :  status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST   question=question  advice.save    advice  =  Advice.objects.create content=serializer.validated_data["content"],  author=user  ,  "Question   does   not   exist!"},  We are storing the currently logged-in user in the user variable. Next, we are fetching an instance of the Question model through the pk parameter and   storing it in the question variable.  We have added a try-catch block here. Suppose the pk provided by the URL  is  invalid,  and  no  question  exists  matching  that  pk.  It  will  raise  a DoesNotExist exception. We are catching the exception and returning a 400 bad request.  Then we are creating a new instance of the Advice model. We pass it the content field received from the user-submitted data after it’s been validated, user and question. Lastly, we are calling the save method, which will create the  instance  for  us.  After  we  save  the  instance,  we  return  a  JSON  or  Dict Object.    data_to_return = { "username": advice.author.username, "user_url": reverse 'profile', args=[advice.author.pk], request=request , "user_image":request.build_absolute_uri advice.author.profile.image.url , "content": advice.content, "date_published":formats.date_format advice.date_published,  "SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT"   }  return Response data_to_return, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED   We are creating an object called data_to_return and passing it the newly created  advice  data  and  user  information.  This  is  the  same  information  we were  returning  in  our  list  view.  The  only  difference  is  that  now  we  are returning a single object, the newly created advice instance.  One  last  thing  we  should  mention  here  is  that  our  create  view  is  a protected  route.  It  will  only  work  if  the  user  is  logged  in.  We  usually  use token-based authentication with REST APIs, but that is a separate topic of its own.  Currently,  we  are  relying  on  Django's  default  session-based authentication system to authenticate ourselves. This is suitable for us as we will only be performing AJAX calls right from our web application.    Advice Create View URL Pattern   Open  the  urls.py  file  of  the  advice  application  and  add  the  following open  patterns   pattern   URL   and   list   the   to   URL  http:  localhost:8000 questions api 3 create.    path 'api   create', views.AdviceCreateView.as_view   ,       Figure 88 Without getting method view  You  can  see  it  says,  “\GET  not  allowed”.  We  didn’t  specify  the  get method  on  our  view,  and  the  reason  it  shows  us  this  message  because  we performed a GET request when we opened this page. You can see the form below. Let’s test our API through this form. Remember, we only need to send a single attribute, i.e., content.     Figure 89 Single attribute view  We’ve added the following JSON in the form. It has a content key and a message as the value. Remember, our API accepts JSON data, and this is the only field our serializer expects. You can send other fields, it wouldn’t make a  difference,  but  this  field  has  to  be  sent  because  we  would  get  an  error otherwise.  Now hit submit, and it will create a new advice instance. The view will fetch a question by the pk we provide in the URL and set that to the advice instance’s question field. It will set the currently logged-in user as the author of the advice. It will set the content we sent through the form as the content of the advice. Finally, it will create a new instance.       Figure 90 New instance view   After  creating  successfully,  we  will  get  the  newly  created  advice  back. Now visit the AdviceListView URL, and you should see the advice we just created displayed as JSON Object.       Figure 91 All advice list  Now that we have created the APIs, we will now access these through on- page  javascript  to  retrieve  advice  and  create  new  advice  on  the  Question model's detail page.   Embed Advices  We will now use the AdviceListVIew API and display all the advices of a  question  on  the  detail  page  of  questions.  Open  the  question_detail.html template  inside  the  templates>advice  directory  of  the  advice  application. Replace the existing code with the code below.    {% extends "blog base.html" %} {% block content %}             <div   class="mugshot-img   mb-2"   style="background-  image:url {{question.author.profile.image.url}} ">    {{question.author.username}}        {{question.date_publisheddate:"d m Y h:i a"}}               Q:         {{question.title}}        {% if request.user == question.author %}    Delete     {% endif %}                         loading advices...  {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}        Post an advice  <textarea  class="form-control  advice-form  mb-2"  name="answer"  id="answer"  class="btn   btn-primary"   type="submit"   id="post-          {% else %}   Login   to  post  an  rows="5">  <button   comment">Submit   advice   {% endif %}                {% endblock content %}  Code 84 financeblog\advice\templates\advice\question_detail.html   The template is the same as before except for a few changes. We have now added a form that allows users to post advice to the question. We have also added a floating message that says, “loading advice...”.  Note that the form and the floating messages are pure HTML and CSS. We have yet to add any javascript to make them functional. Also, note that we are performing a check to see if the user is logged in or not and only then displaying the form. Take a look at our detail page  seen as guest .       Figure 92 Question detail page when the user logged out      Figure 93 Question detail page when the user logged in  Let’s add the javascript code to fetch this question's advice but first, let’s open our base.html template and create a block template tag for js. Open the base.html  template  inside  the  templates>blog  directory  of  the  blog application and add the following code after the last script tag.    After    making  this  change,  your  base.html  template  should  have  the  rough structure of the following code snippet.    {% block js %} {% endblock js %}  {% load static %}  {% block content %} {% endblock content %}  …  …   {% block js %} {% endblock js %}        Code 85 financeblog\blog\templates\blog\base.html  The reason we are creating a new block template tag is that we will be using a Technology called JQuery. Since the content block comes before the script tags in the HTML document, our jquery code will throw errors because we  are  trying  to  use  something  that  hasn’t  been  loaded  yet.  Remember, HTML documents are read from top to bottom.  Now  go  back  to  the  question_detail.html  template  and  outside  the content block and create a new js block. We are going to code a simple JS Method  that  will  fetch  data  from  our  REST  API  and  insert  “live”  into  our HTML Page, that has already been loaded.    {% block js %}    $ document .ready function  {     This function runs once and fetches the advices of this specific question. function fetchAdvicesUpdateUI  {     Fetching Data from our own REST API fetch " questions api {{question.id}}"  .then res => res.json    .then data => {  let answers = []    Loop over the data returned from the api. for var i = 0; i < data.length; i ++ {     Constructing the markup from the data returned from API. var answer = [  "  ", "<a class='mugshot-container mb-1' href='", data[i].user_url, "'> <div class='mugshot-img-sm mb-2' style='background-image:url ", data[i].user_image, " '>  ", data[i].username,   "    ", data[i].date_published, "     ", data[i].content, "   "  ] answers.push answer.join ""    }  }  }  if  answers.length < 1 {  } else{  answers = [' No answers posted to this thread yet! ']  answers.unshift ' Answers: '      Loop over the advices array and push it to our html document. for var i = 0; i < answers.length; i++ {  $ "answer-above" .before answers[i]      Hide the loading advices message. $ ".loading-comment" .css "display", "none"   }  }    Load the advices once on page was loaded. fetchAdvicesUpdateUI    }     {% endblock js %}  Code 86 financeblog\advice\templates\advice\question_detail.html  This was much code so let’s go over it in detail. We have opened the js block  and  have  created  a script  tag  inside  it.  We  are  using  jquery’s ready method to ensure that our code runs after the document has been fully loaded. Next, we have created a method called fetchAdvicesUpdateUI which will be responsible for calling the API and updating our page.     fetch " questions api {{question.id}}"  .then res => res.json    .then data => {...  other code}  This fetch function is a built-in javascript function used to make HTTP   requests. We are requesting to “ question api {{question.id}}”,  question.id refers  to  the  pk  parameter  our  URL  pattern  expects.  This  will  be  used  to identify which question’s advice we need. This question will return us some sort of response, and we are retrieving our JSON data through that response.  Next, we are using that data to display the advice on our page. Note that we  aren’t  passing  a  full  path  to  the  fetch  method  because  when  we  pass partial paths like these, it assumes that we are talking about the current host.  We have heavily commented on the Jquery code to understand what it is doing. Still, just to give you the gist, after the API has returned the advice data, we are manipulating the HTML DOM and creating the structure of our advice.  Next,  we  are  adding  that  structure  to  the  page  and  hiding  the “...loading  advices”  message.  Now  when  you  open  the  detail  page  of  a question, you should see its advice being fetched live.    Figure 94 Live fetching of advice  Create Advice on Question Detail Page   Now  that  our  advices  are  being  fetched  and  we  are  displaying  them successfully,  it’s  time  to  set  up  our  form  so  it  sends  data  to  the AdviceCreateView API and creates advice for us. Our AdviceCreateView API returns the newly created advice, and we will add that to our page.  Before we add the code, let’s briefly talk about authentication. By default, Django uses session-based authentication. When we log in, the server creates a session, stores it in the database, and attaches a session id to the browser cookie. When we make further requests to the server, we send the session id with  the  request,  and  the  server  uses  that  to  authenticate  us.  The  HTTP protocol  is  stateless,  meaning  if  we  don’t  send  the  session  cookie  with  the request, the server will not be able to recognize us and treat us as logged-out users.   We usually use Token Based authentication in the case of REST APIs, but  for  our  use  case  where  we  will  only  be  using  the  API  on  our  web application  through  AJAX,  Django’s  default  session  authentication  is  more than enough for our current setup. Append the following javascript code to the script tag of the question_detail.html template.       Whenever form is submitted, execute following method. $ ".post-answer-form" .on "submit", function  e  {  e.preventDefault      Pass the content from the input box postAdvice $ '.advice-form' .val     }   function postAdvice content  {     Check if answer was empty and return if true. if  content.length === 0  {  $ "form-error" .text "Can't be empty!"  $ "form-error" .css "display", "block"  return;  } $ "form-error" .css "display", "none"     Hide button interaction $ "post-comment" .text "Wait..." .attr 'disabled', true ;     Construct data to send to our REST API var mydata = {   'content': content,  };     Insert question-id and user-token for the POST request. fetch ' questions api {{question.id}} create', {  method: 'POST', headers: {  'Content-Type': 'application json',    Get the csrf token. 'X-CSRFTOKEN': Cookies.get 'csrftoken'   },    data we want to send to api body: JSON.stringify mydata   }  .then res => res.json    .then data => {     Constructing markup in array from data received. var answer = [  "  ", "<a class='mugshot-container mb-1' href='", data.user_url, "'> <div class='mugshot-img-sm mb-2' style='background-image:url ", data.user_image, " '>  ", data.username, "    ", data.date_published, "     ", data.content, "   "  ]  } else {   '      If answers exist, post before the latest answer  at the top . if  $ ".answer" .length > 0  {  $ "answer-here" .after answer.join ''  ;     If this is the first anser, this will be posted before the identifier. $ "answer-above" .after '<h3  class="answer-heading"   id="answer-here">Answers:  $ "answer-here" .after answer.join ''   $ ".no-answer" .css "display", "none"   }    Updating button to 'clickable' and changing text back to "Submit". $ "post-comment" .text "Submit" .attr 'disabled', false ;    Clear the input field. $ '.advice-form' .val "" ;    Scroll to answer we just saved and the api returned. $ "html, body" .animate {  scrollTop: $ "answer-here" .offset  .top   }, 500 ;    Unfocus the submit button. $ "post-comment" .blur  ;  }  .catch err => console.log err   }  Code 87 financeblog\advice\templates\advice\question_detail.html  We have prevented the default behaviour of the form on submit and are running  a  function  called  postAdvice.  To  postAdvice  we  are  passing  the contents of the text area where the user entered their advice.  After performing some checks on the user-submitted data, we are storing it in an object my_data under the critical content. If you remember, our API only expects a content field. This is where the magic happens.    fetch ' questions api {{question.id}} create', {  method: 'POST', headers: {  'Content-Type': 'application json',    we get the csrf token and attach it to our request 'X-CSRFTOKEN': Cookies.get 'csrftoken'   },     data we want to send to api  body:JSON.stringify mydata   }  .then res => res.json    .then data => {  ...other code}           This  piece  of  JS  Code  sends  a  POST-Request  to  the  REST  API  path “ questions api {{question.pk}} create”.  Inside  the  headers,  we  are  telling the  Backend  that  our  Request  Body  we  will  be  of  type  JSON.  We  have  to pass  the  csrftoken  to  identify  ourself,  and  it’ll  be  used  to  authenticate  the incoming request at the view.  We are fetching the csrftoken from the browser using the cookies library we imported in our base.html in the second chapter. Remember, this cookie   was sent to our browser by the Server  Django . Lastly, we are attaching our my_data object after converting it to JSON string into the request's body.  When  we  perform  the  request,  the  API  will  return  the  newly  created advice instance to us, and we are then handling that data to display the advice on  the  page.  You  can  read  the  comments  of  the  code  to  see  how  we  are displaying the returned data.       Figure 95 Advice submitting  Upon pressing the submit button, you will be taken to the top of the page,  and your newly created advice will be shown to you in a nice animation.     Figure 96 Newly created advice view  Submitting  an  empty  advice,  will  return  an  error.  As  we  can  see,  our advices  are  getting  saved  successfully  and  we  can  see  them  appear  on  the page without the page even reloading. Your question_detail.html template should look like this after adding the js for the list and create API.    {% extends "blog base.html" %}  {% block content %} ... {% endblock content %}  {% block js %}    $ document .ready function    {  function fetchAdvicesUpdateUI   {  }   Load the advices once on page load. fetchAdvicesUpdateUI    ...  ...    whenever form is submitted, we run this function. $ ".post-answer-form" .on "submit", function  e  {   function postAdvice content  {  }   ...  } }     {% endblock js %}  Code 88 financeblog\advice\templates\advice\question_detail.html     That  is  it.  You’ve  been  exposed  to  a  pretty  wide   but  still  deep   set  of tools  in  the  Django  Universe.  The  next  thing  we  will  do  is  show  our Application to the world. Sell you App, your Idea, your Product, or whatever it is that you will be developing with Django 3.   Cloud Deploy  CLOUD DEPLOY  What is serverless deployment?  In a traditional hosting strategy, we buy a hosting from a hosting service provider,  which  is  usually  a  linux  machine.  We  then  have  to  configure  it ourselves  to  run  our  application.  For  example  we  have  to  install  python, django, manage proxies and load balancers etc. Also note that we get a fixed amount of resources RAM, CPU  core in the hosting package that we buy.  This  model  has  a  few  problems.  First  is  that  you  have  to  pay  a  fixed amount no matter if the work you are doing doesn’t justify the costs at all. Second is it gets harder if we want to scale the application. A sudden increase in traffic or the like can very likely shut down your server unless you upgrade your hosting plan.  With serverless, we don’t have to manage the servers ourselves. All we do is that we deploy our code and the serverless service provider manages it for  us.  Do  note  that  there  are  still  servers  involved,  it’s  just  that  managing them have been abstracted away from us. One more plus point of a serverless hosting is that you only pay for the amount of time your application is ran. The  actual  specifics  are  different  but  the  idea  is  generally  the  same.  For example, one serverless service provider might charge you based per request made  to  the  server  or  others  might  charge  you  some  minuscle  amount  of money for every GB of memory used etc.  That is why, for this guide, we will deploy our application to a serverless  hosting.   Google Cloud Run + Docker  We will be using Google Cloud run for this purpose as well as docker. We’ll use a variety of backing services with google cloud run to ensure our application works correctly. Which backing services you might ask? Google cloud run will only store and run your code. You still need a database to save the data as well as some sort of space to store static files css files, js files and user uploaded images etc .  For  these  purposes  we  will  use  Google  cloud  SQL  and    Google  Cloud storage.  You  can  sign  up  for  Google  Cloud  run  and  you  will  get  $300  in credit free when you provide your billing credentials. Don’t worry as you’ll not  be  charged,  this  is  just  so  they  can  keep  spam  at  low.  This  free  tier  is good enough for development and testing purposes so we will go with it. What is Docker?  You  might  be  wondering  what  Docker  is.  Docker  is  a  way  to  sort  of containerize your application so it behaves the same way no matter which os and machine you run it on.  In simple terms, Suppose you are working on a django application on a linux machine with some version of python. Your friend wants to help with your code but they are running a windows machine with a different python version. Some problems might occur as you both try to run the same code and you might get around it by using virtualenvs but it’s still very prone to error and bugs.  Enter Docker. Docker will put all of your code in a container  think of it as a virtual environment  and you can run it pretty much on any machine that has  docker  installed  on  it.  It  doesn’t  matter  whether  the  other  machine  has python or not, docker will internally take care of everything and reproduce the  same  environment  on  each  machine  so  the  application  behaves  as expected.   Think of Docker as Virtual Machines - but lightweight and fast as  compared to a virtual machine.  Installing Docker  If  you  haven’t  installed  Docker  for  the  PostgreSQL  Database,  you  will need  to  do  it  now.  Head  over  to  https:  www.docker.com products docker- desktop and download Docker Desktop. You should choose the version for your OS. The installation process will be mostly the same. After downloading and opening the setup file.  It will download some packages and then ask for these components. The first one is compulsory so check it and proceed to clicking the ok button. If you’re on windows, you’ll probably get the following error while restarting after the setup completes.  Since  Windows  doesn’t  have  a  linux  kernel  by  default,  this  error  is understandable.  Follow  the  link,  install  all  necessary  dependencies  and return.         Setting up Google Cloud  With  docker  installed,  we  need  to  configure  the  backing  services  we’ll need to run our project on google cloud run. First, head over to google cloud console at https:  console.cloud.google.com. If this is your first time opening cloud console, you’ll probably be shown a welcome screen.  Select their  terms of service and continue. Next you should enable billing for your cloud console by clcking the “Activate” button at the top right side of the screen. As stated before, you’ll get $300 in credit which is more than enough for our blogging application just for testing purposes. If in th future this $300 credit does run out, google will prompt you to manually continute to paying for services instead of automatically deducting money from your account which is a big plus.  Setting up a google cloud project  With billing enabled, you now need to create a new project on the cloud console. Click the “Select a project” link on the nav bar on the home screen   of google cloud console.      Under Project name, enter a name for your project and keep the Location option  as  default.  After  creating  the  project,  you’ll  be  redirected  to  the Google Cloud Dashboard.     Great, your google cloud project has been created. If you can see, I called my project “Django 3”. There is also a field called Project ID. Please keep this field in mind as we’ll use it to identify this project when creating the backing services.  Installing Cloud SDK  We’ll  need  google  cloud  sdk  to  be  able  to  interact  with  cloud  console from  our  machine.  Head  over  to  https:  cloud.google.com sdk docs install and download the version for your os. Since I’m on a windows machine, I’ll download the windows version.  After downloading the setup, run the installer and click yourself through  it…you know the drill.         If everything worked, you should see a prompt that will ask you log in  into your Google Cloud Account or Project.      Enter  “y”  and  you’ll  be  redirected  to  your  browser  for  authentication purposes. Enter your credentials and you’ll be asked to provide permissions to cloud sdk.     As you can see, my project django-3 is showing here. Since my project is  at number  “1”, I’ll enter that into the command prompt. Setting up CloudSQL  Our  django  application  uses  a  PostgresSql  database.  Remember,  Cloud run  just  runs  our  code,  we  still  need  a  database  separate  from  cloud  run. We’ll  use  Google’s  CloudSQL.  In  your  cloud  console  dashboard  in  your current project, search for Google Cloud SQL.      Select “GO TO CLOUD SQL” and you’ll be redirected to another screen where  you’ll  be  asked  to  create  a  new  instance.  Make  sure  you  are  on  the right project by looking at the drop down next to “Google Cloud Platform” link in the header. When you click “CREATE INSTANCE”, you’ll be taken to another screen.     Since our Django 3 Application uses PostgresSQL database, we’ll select  PostgresSQL instance.         You’ll then be taken to a form for creating a PostgresSql instance. Note that  we  are  not  creating  a  “database”  yet,  this  is  sort  of  like  installing PostgresSql on your machine.  In the “Instance ID” field, enter a name you want to use for this instance. I’m  calling  mine  “django-3-postgres-instance”.  The  password  field  is  for the  default  “postgres”  user.  Make  sure  that  the  password  is  a  strong  one. Leave all other fields as they are and click create instance. If your instance was created successfully, you’ll be redirected to the following page   Next click the “Databases” link on the side navigation bar and you’ll be  taken to a new page.     Create  a  new  database  by  clicking  the  “CREATE  DATABSE”  button. You’ll  be  prompted  to  select  a  name  for  your  database.  I’m  calling  my database  “django-3-postgres-database”.  After  creating  your  database   successfully, you’ll now see your newly created database listed here.  Next we need to create a User for our database. We’ll do this from the coud console online shell. On your navigation bar at the top, there should be a console icon on the right side         Inside the Terminal, enter the following command:  gcloud sql connect   --user postgres  Do note that you are to enter you instance name, not your database name. We are creating a new user on our postgres instance. My instance name is django-3-postgres-instance so my command will become.  gcloud sql connect django-3-postgres-instance –user postgres  You might be asked to enter your google credentials. Afterwards, you’ll be asked to enter the password for the “postgres” superuser of your database   instance. Enter the password for your postgres user that you chose previously while  creating  the  PostgresSql  instance  and  you’ll  be  given  access  to  the PostgresSql shell as shown in the image below.     Once you have access to the postgres shell, run the following command to  create a new user called Django.  CREATE USER test WITH PASSWORD ‘your_password_here’;  Make sure you replace the above string with your password. I’ve named this user test, you can call it whatever you want. Finally, give this user all rights on your database by running the following command.  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ‘ ’ TO test  Do  note  that  we  are  now  referencing  the  database  name,  not  our PostgresSql  installation  instance  name.  I  named  my  database  ‘django-3- postgres-database’. Here’s the shell output. Great, Our postgres database is ready to be utilized. Cloud Storage bucket  Our  database  setup  is  complete.  We  now  need  to  set  up  Cloud  Storage   bucket  which  will  hold  all  of  our  static  files  and  user  uploaded  images.  A bucket is sort of a directory where you will store all of your files. We’ll be storing all the django static files inside a such bucket.  As  for  why  we  need  a  separate  place  for  storing  static  files,  If  you remember, way earlier in the tutorial, django is not suitable for serving static assets. Moreover, cloud run will only run the code and not store any files we upload to a storage. That is where Cloud Storage comes into picture. There are other options such as Amazon s3 buckets but we’ll use Google’s Cloud Storage.  Head over to https:  console.cloud.google.com storage browser. Click the “Create Bucket” button to create a new bucket.  Follow the steps described in the images attached below.        Give  your  bucket  a  unique  name.  I’ve  called  my  bucket  “django-3- bucket”.Choose  Fine-Grained  as  access  control.  I’ve  left  other  fields  as default  but  I’ve  still  shown  them  in  the  images  attached  just  to  avoid  any confusions.  If  everything  goes  okay,  you’ll  be  redirected  to  the  following screen      information in Secret Manager  We are finished setting the backing services. We’ll use these services in our django project but linking them in our settings.py file is a serious security flaw  as  it’ll  be  visible.  We  need  to  store  the  information  regarding  these services inside a secret environment. Google Cloud’s Secret Manager is the tool for this purpose.  First, create a file called .env somewhere on your computer. Open it with  a code editor and add the following strings to it:  DATABASE_URL=postgres:   :   @  cloudsql  : :      GS_BUCKET_NAME=  SECRET_KEY=   You have to enter your data in the bolded text fields. First we are defining a key called DATABASE_URL. We’ll use this inside our django project to   connect  to  the  database  we  just  created  on  cloud  console.  In  case  you  are “ : : confused     ” mean, this is the connection string used to identify the database you created earlier.  to  what   as   sql,   cloud   If you have trouble recalling the names of the database and instance name of  to https:  console.cloud.google.com sql instances , and you will see the database you created earlier listed over there. Click your instance and you’ll be taken to  it’s  detail  page.  After  scrolling  down  a  bit,  you  should  see  “Connection String”.  simply   head   over         Copy  this  connection  string  and  put  it  into  the  DATABASE_URL key.Note  that  this  is  your  sql  instance  connection  string.  You  you  have  to append your database name to the end of this connection string. Also note to add  the  database  user  and  the  database  user’s  password  to  the  key.  My DATABASE_URL key will look like this.  DATABASE_URL=postgres:  test:my_user_password_here@  cloudsql django-3-307211:us- central1:django-3-postgres-instance django-3-postgres-database   The GS_BUCKET_NAME is simple, you just need to append the name of the cloud storage buket you created earlier. If you don’t remember your bucket  name,  you  can  refer  to  it  by  navigating  to  the  cloud  storage  page inside cloud console.  Lastly,  in  the  SECRET_KEY  key,  enter  a  random  generated  string  of length 50. You can generate a secret key by entering numbers manually or using a generator like https:  miniwebtool.com django-secret-key-generator .  After you are finished entering correct data into the .env file, head over to https:  console.cloud.google.com security secret-manager  and  create  a  new secret  make sure you are on the correct project by checking th top navigation bar . When you create a new secret, You’ll be redirected to a new form.  Give  it  the  name  “django-settings”  and  upload  the  .env  file  we  just created. Leave other fields as they are and create the secret. You will then be redirected to the detail page of the secret you just created.         Note  the  highlighted  secretid  in  the  image  attached  below  as  we’ll  be using it later. It is under projects   secrets django-settings. Next select the Permission tab on the same page and click “Add Member”.     In the “New Members” field, using the   we copied in the step  before, add the following two strings:   -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com  @cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com  Filling the placeholders with my data I get:  834108577961-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com 834108577961@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com  From the roles dropdown, select Secret Ma`nager Secret Accessor and  hit save.     Go  back  to  secret  manager  page  and  create  a  new  secret  called “superuser_password”. This secret will basically act as the password of the   django  website  superuser  in  production  deployment.  Keep  this  in  mind  as you’ll be using it to logn to the admin panel of our website. In the value field, set a password for the user:     Just like we did with the last secret, go to the permissions tab and select  Add members. Add only the following string in the New members field:   @cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com  Next, select the Secret Manager Secret Accessor as the role just like we did previously. Finally, save and your secrets are ready. Let’s talk about why we created a secret for super user password. We usually create the superuser through  the  django  terminal  but  in  deployment,  we’ll  be  creating  it  with  a migration  file.  We’ll  pull  the  password  from  the  environment  dynamically and create the user. You’ll see what it means in a bit. Cloud Build access to Cloud SQL   Our  cloud  build  will  need  to  run  the  database  migrations  but  it  doesn’t have  access  to  it  by  default.  Let’s  give  it  appropriate  access.  Head  over  to https:  console.cloud.google.com iam-admin iam  and  again,  make  sure  you are under the correct project. You’ll be taken to a screen like so.    In the previos step when creating secret manager for django settings and admin password, I asked you to hold on to the secretid. It’s this one if you don’t remember and it is visible on your secret manager page.   Now on the current page, “IAM & ADMIN” page that you are on, you want to search for “ @cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com”,  in my  case,  it  becomes:  834108577961@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com  as you can see on my screen  note: your id will be different from mine .      Click  the  edit  “pencil”  button  next  to  the  highlighted  account  and  the following sidebar will open.Click the “ADD ANOTHER ROLE” button and select “Cloud SQL Client”. Click save and exit. Preparing Code for Deployment  Now that our backing services have been configured, we can deploy our django application to the web. However we need to make adjustments to our code and make it ready for deployment.  For  example,  we  need  to  configure  the  project  to  store  and  get  static assets from Cloud Storage, save data to Cloud sql etc. Also note that we will be  starting  from  a  new  and  empty  database.  This  means  that  whatever redundant  data  we  have  on  our  local  database,  will  not  make  it  to  the production  environment.    We  also  suggest  you  to  create  a  copy  of  your project in case anything goes wrong.  Installing Modules  Google  cloud  run  will  need  a  way  to  know  which  python  modules  our project uses. For that, we will create a file called requirements.txt and put all of the modules required by our application inside that file. Go to the root of your  project’s  directory  and  run  the  following  command make  sure  your virtual env is running .   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>pip freeze > requirements.txt  Running  the  above  command  should  have  created  a  file  called requirements.txt in the root of your project directory. If you’ve followed the tutorial  so  far,  the  requirements.txt  file  will  have  the  following  content  versions might differ .    asgiref==3.3.1 Django==3.1.3   django-cors-headers==3.6.0 django-crispy-forms==1.10.0 djangorestframework==3.12.2 djangorestframework-simplejwt==4.6.0 Markdown==3.3.3 Pillow==8.0.1 psycopg2==2.8.6 PyJWT==2.0.0 pytz==2020.4 sqlparse==0.4.1  gunicorn==20.0.4 psycopg2-binary==2.8.5 google-cloud-secret-manager==2.1.0 google-auth==1.24.0 django-storages[google]==1.9.1 django-environ==0.4.5  For  our  production  environment,  we  will  need  a  few  more  python modules  e.g  django-storages  for  connecting  to  the  Cloud  Storage,  django- environs  for  managing  environment  variables  etc.  Add  the  following  new modules to our requirements.txt file so it looks like this.  We’ve  removed  one  module  i.e.  psycopg2,  which  we  were  using  to connect  to  our  local  database.  Our  cloud  version  woud  not  be  needing  this module.  Creating Super User  Since we will be starting from an empty database, we will not have our superuser on the produciton version by default, we will have to create one. However  it  will  be  very  difficult  to  open  a  terminal  in  the  context  of  our running application once it is on the cloud. Therefore we will not be able to create a django superuser the normal way i.e. by running the createsuperuser command.   We  will  use  a  technique  called  data  migration.  It  is  a  way  of  making changes to the database  these can be CRUD operations  by regular migration files. If you remember, Django creates a migration file for each of the Model we define or make changes to and when we run our migrations, those schema changes get updated to the database. A data migration is similar but we have to  create  the  migration  file  ourselves  and  it  will  make  changes  to  the  data inside the database.  Creating Data Migration for Superuser  If  we  create  a  migration  file  in  one  of  our  existing  applications,  it  can cause  conflicts  with  the  existing  Django  migration  files  of  that  specific application, that is why, we will create a new application. Head over to the root  directory  of  your  project  and  create  a  new  application  by  running  the following command.   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>python manage.py startapp superuser  This  command  will  create  a  new  application  called  superuser  in  your project. This application will have no functionality, we will only be using it to  create  our  data  migration.  As  stated  before,  if  we  were  to  create  a  data migration in one of our existing applications, it would clash with one of the existing migrations and while those are solvable, they are very hard to debug. That  is  why  we  are  choosing  this  simple  approach.  Next  head  over  to  the settings.py located inside your project’s directory under the path.  Add  the  application  we  just  created  to  the  settings.py  where  our  other  applications are listed.  INSTALLED_APPS = [ 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes',   'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'blog', 'profiles', 'crispy_forms', 'advice', 'rest_framework', 'superuser'  <-new app here ]  Now that our application is registered, we can create the data migration  file by running the following command.   MyProject  E:\MyProject\financeblog>manage.py makemigrations --empty superuser Migrations for 'superuser': superuser\migrations\0001_initial.py  This  command  will  create  a  data  migration  file  for  us  inside  our superuser  application.  Open  the  newly  created  file  in  your  superuser application directory.     Override the contents of the file with the following code.  from django.db import migrations  import google.auth from google.cloud import secretmanager as sm  def createsuperuser apps, schema_editor :    Retrieve secret from Secret Manager project_id = "django-3-307211" _, project = google.auth.default   client = sm.SecretManagerServiceClient   admin_password   =   "projects "+project_id+" secrets superuser_password versions 1"} .payload.data.decode "UTF- 8"   client.access_secret_version request={"name":   Create a new user using acquired password from django.contrib.auth.models import User User.objects.create_superuser "admin", password=admin_password   class Migration migrations.Migration :  initial = True  dependencies = [ ]  operations = [  ]  migrations.RunPython createsuperuser   The code is a bit complicated but we will simplify it for you. The only  important part of this code is this.   Retrieve secret from Secret Manager  project_id = "django-3-307211" _, project = google.auth.default   client = sm.SecretManagerServiceClient   admin_password   =   "projects "+project_id+" secrets superuser_password versions 1"} .payload.data.decode "UTF- 8"   client.access_secret_version request={"name":   Create a new user using acquired password from django.contrib.auth.models import User User.objects.create_superuser "admin", password=admin_password   Since  our  project  will  be  ran  in  the  cloud,  we  will  have  access  to  our project by using the googl auth module. We are retrieving the current project and  then  using  that  project’s  name,  we  are  pulling  the  admin_password secret  we  created  earlier  in  our  secret  manager.  Also  note  that  in  the project_id variable, you have to put your cloud console project id. Mine is   django-3-307211 so i’ve used that. We don’t have to authenticate ourselves here,  as  this  code  will  be  executed  in  the  “Cloud Run”  Service  where  we will already be authenticated.  In short, In this file we are using the google cloud serect manager module to retrieve our password that we stored earlier in our Google Secret Manager and used it to create a new superuser.  Now whenever we run our migrations, Django will look at this migration file and create a superuser with the password supplied by the secret manager. Of course it will give us error as our code is right now so let’s move on to adjusting our code.  Configuring the settings.py file  We need to configure our project settings. For example, we are currently storing static and media files in our local storage using the “STATIC_URL” and “MEDIA_URL” settings.  We  need  to  remove  these  and  configure  the project  so  it  uses  the  Cloud  storage.  We  also  need  to  import  the  secret manager .env file that we uploaded to google secret manager earlier. We will get the connection string for the db from the env file.  You  know  the  drill,  head  over  to  the  settings.py  file  of  our  project. Before  proceeding  further,  if  you  haven’t  already  created  a  backup  of  the project, at least create a backup of the settings.py file. This file will undergo, as you might expect, the thoughest surgery. Before we dive into the details of what needs to be changed, here is the final fully functional settings.py.  from pathlib import Path import io import environ import google.auth from google.cloud import secretmanager  create instance of environment variable   env = environ.Env   retrieve current project from google cloud _, project = google.auth.default    name of the secret manager where we uploaded our .env file SETTINGS_NAME = "django_settings" creating instance of secret manager to pull secrets from client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient   project_id = "django-3-307211" payload   =    load secret manager data into environment variable env.read_env io.StringIO payload    "projects "+project_id+" secrets django-settings versions 1"} .payload.data.decode "UTF-8"   client.access_secret_version request={"name":  BASE_DIR = Path __file__ .resolve  .parent.parent SECRET_KEY = env "SECRET_KEY"  DEBUG = False ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"] INSTALLED_APPS = [ 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'blog', 'profiles', 'crispy_forms', 'advice', 'rest_framework', 'superuser' , 'storages' ]  MIDDLEWARE = [ 'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware', 'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware', 'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware', 'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware', 'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware', 'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware', 'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware', ] ROOT_URLCONF = 'financeblog.urls' TEMPLATES = [ {  'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates', 'DIRS': [], 'APP_DIRS': True, 'OPTIONS': {  'context_processors': [   'django.template.context_processors.debug', 'django.template.context_processors.request', 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth', 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',  ],  },  }, ]  …  WSGI_APPLICATION = 'financeblog.wsgi.application' DATABASES = {"default": env.db  }  responsible for pulling the cloud storage bucket name GS_BUCKET_NAME = env "GS_BUCKET_NAME"   setting the default storage of our django to cloud storage DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = "storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage"  setting cloud storage as default for putting static asset STATICFILES_STORAGE = "storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage"  making files available to public view GS_DEFAULT_ACL = "publicRead"  We haven’t changed the file too much – but these changes are make-or- brake type of changes for the Cloud Deployment. We have added explanation comments at the part that changed. Let’s look at the part where we added new code and chaned previuos code.  Here  we  are  importing  a  module  called  environ package  is  django- environ .  We  will  be  using  the  module  for  creating  environment  variables. Speaking of environment variables, we will be pulling these from our Google Secret Manager using the google.auth and google.cloud modules.  import io import environ import google.auth from google.cloud import secretmanager  create instance of environment variable env = environ.Env   retrieve current project from google cloud _, project = google.auth.default      name of the secret manager where we uploaded our .env file SETTINGS_NAME = "django_settings" creating instance of secret manager to pull secrets from client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient   project_id = "django-3-307211" payload   =    load secret manager data into environment variable env.read_env io.StringIO payload    "projects "+project_id+" secrets django-settings versions 1"} .payload.data.decode "UTF-8"   client.access_secret_version request={"name":  In  this  piece  of  code,  we  are  first  creating  an  instance  of  the  environ module. Next we are fetching the google cloud project from the google auth module. How does it know which project we are talking about? It will know this because this code will be deployed to a specific cloud project i.e. django- 3 google cloud project in my case.  If you remember, we called our secret manager which holds our env file, “django_settings”.  We  are  using  this  name  to  pull  the  .env  file  from  our Secret Manager and feeding it to the environment variable we created earlier. As we stated before, note the connection string, you have to pass your project id.  SECRET_KEY = env "SECRET_KEY"   We are now pulling the secret key from our environment variable. It gets  this from the secret manager it pulled in the previos step.  We have also set debug to false so error messages aren’t logged on the  screens of the users browsing our website.  DEBUG = False  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]   In ALLOWED_HOSTS setting, we have set the asterik character which basically means to allow access from any url. Since we want the whole world to be able to browse our website, we used this setting.  INSTALLED_APPS = [ 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'blog', 'profiles', 'crispy_forms', 'advice', 'rest_framework', 'superuser' , 'storages' ]  We have added an app called “storages” to our list of installed apps. This application  will  be  responsible  for  letting  us  communicate  with  Cloud Storage.  DATABASES = {"default": env.db  }  In  our  databases  setting,  we  are  pulling  the  connection  string  from  our environment variable. If you remember, we added the connection string to the .env  file  before  we  saved  it  to  the  Secret  Manager.  The  .db    method automatically  fetches  any  database  settings  we  have  on  our  environment variable. We could have simply stated env “DATABASE_URL”  as we did with pulling the secret key, but this is the preferred method.  responsible for pulling the cloud storage bucket name GS_BUCKET_NAME = env "GS_BUCKET_NAME"   setting the default storage of our django to cloud storage DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = "storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage"  setting cloud storage as default for putting static asset STATICFILES_STORAGE = "storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage"    making files available to public view GS_DEFAULT_ACL = "publicRead"  We  are  getting  our  cloud  storage  bucket  name  from  the  environment variable. Next we are setting the default static assets storage as well as the storage for media files so it uses Cloud Storage bucket. Lastly, we are making the files stored on Cloud Storage bucket accessible to the public internet as we want users to be able  to view media files and use our static assets  css, and js files .  If you noticed, we removed the “STATIC_URL”,“MEDIA_URL”  and “MEDIA_ROOT” as those settings used local storage for storing media and asset files. These are all the changes we’ve made to the code.  Changing Image URLs in our REST APIs  Currently, the url links of the images returned in our REST APIs of the Advice  application  are  not  configured  for  production.  That  is  because  by default when using local storage, DRF Django rest framework  only returns the  relative  path  of  media  files,  not  the  absolute  path.  A  path  to  an  image looks like “ media image1.jpg”.  That is why we have appended the name of the domain before this string and then we returned the response. This was good in development but since we are now using storage buckets, DRF will return full absolute url paths. We have to adjust the current code. Head over to the views.py file found inside advice>views.py. At line 33, we have the following code.  "user_image":request.build_absolute_uri advice.author.profile.image.url ,  Change it to:  "user_image":advice.author.profile.image.url,   At line 51, we have the previous same code:  "user_image":request.build_absolute_uri advice.author.profile.image.url ,  Again, change it to:  user_image = advice.author.profile.image.url  As you can see, before we were building the full image path ourselves, but now we are simply returning the path returned by django as it’ll be a full path to where the images will be stored on storage bucket. Containerizing the project  As we stated before, in google cloud run, Docker containers are run. We need  to  containarize  our  project.  In  the  root  of  your  project,  create  a  file called Dockerfile. Add the following code to it.  FROM python:3.8-slim  ENV APP_HOME  app WORKDIR $APP_HOME  better loggin ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1   Install modules COPY requirements.txt . RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt   moving code to the container COPY . .  run the service on startup with 8 threads as well as a port CMD  exec  gunicorn  --bind  0.0.0.0:$PORT  --workers  1  --threads  8  --timeout  0  financeblog.wsgi:application   As we stated before, Docker acts similarly to a virtual machine. Think of this  file  like  it’s  a  set  of  instructions  for  installing  a  virtual  machine  along with  some  settings  such  as  installing  python,  running  a  server  etc.  This  is basically what we have done.  If we were to write each and every step ourself, this file would get too long. For example, we would first have to tell docker which os we want, we will then have to specify which server we want and a lot more steps. That is why  we  used  a  pre-existing  image  called  python:3.8-slim.  Running  this command installs a version of linux along with python set up on it without us having to write those instructions ourselves.  Next we are setting a directory called “app” where our code will live. We are then moving the requirements.txt file we created earlier it contains the required python modules for our project  to the app directory. We are then runnng  the  “pip  install”  command  to  install  all  the  modules  listed  in  the requirements.txt file. Finally we are copying our whole code to the working app directory. Lastly, we are running  a service when our docker image will run. We are using gunicorn as the web server.  cloudmigrate.yml  We need a way for cloud console to run some django commands for us, for example, applyin migrations as well as run our application. For this we can create a file called cloudmigrate.yml which will run these commands for us. This file is used by Cloud Build to run our application. In the root of the project, create a file called cloudmigrate.yml and add the following code to it.   [START cloudrun_django_cloudmigrate] steps:  - id: "build image"  name: "gcr.io cloud-builders docker" args: ["build", "-t", "gcr.io ${PROJECT_ID} ${_SERVICE_NAME}", "."]  - id: "push image"   name: "gcr.io cloud-builders docker" args: ["push", "gcr.io ${PROJECT_ID} ${_SERVICE_NAME}"]  - id: "apply migrations"  name: "gcr.io google-appengine exec-wrapper" args: [  "-i", "gcr.io $PROJECT_ID ${_SERVICE_NAME}", "-s", "${PROJECT_ID}:${_REGION}:${_INSTANCE_NAME}", "-e", "SETTINGS_NAME=${_SECRET_SETTINGS_NAME}", "--", "python", "manage.py", "migrate",  - id: "collect static"  name: "gcr.io google-appengine exec-wrapper" args: [  "-i", "gcr.io $PROJECT_ID ${_SERVICE_NAME}", "-s", "${PROJECT_ID}:${_REGION}:${_INSTANCE_NAME}", "-e", "SETTINGS_NAME=${_SECRET_SETTINGS_NAME}", "--", "python", "manage.py", "collectstatic", "--verbosity", "2", "--no-input"  ]  ]  substitutions:  _INSTANCE_NAME: django-3-postgres-instance _REGION: us-central1 _SERVICE_NAME: blog-service _SECRET_SETTINGS_NAME: django_settings  images:  - "gcr.io ${PROJECT_ID} ${_SERVICE_NAME}"   [END cloudrun_django_cloudmigrate]   A cloudmigrate.yml file consists of steps of instructions that we will run.  Let’s look at the first instruction  - id: "build image" name: "gcr.io cloud-builders docker" args: ["build", "-t", "gcr.io ${PROJECT_ID} ${_SERVICE_NAME}", "."]  We have given each instruction an id. The name field points to pre-made containers available on google cloud, also called Cloud Builders, to run our build configuration. In this comand, we are using the docker cloud builder to build our local container.  id: "push image" name: "gcr.io cloud-builders docker" args: ["push", "gcr.io ${PROJECT_ID} ${_SERVICE_NAME}"]        This  next  step  will  push  our  built  container  to  Container  Registry  on  Cloud console.  id: "apply migrations" name: "gcr.io google-appengine exec-wrapper" args: [  "-i", "gcr.io $PROJECT_ID ${_SERVICE_NAME}", "-s", "${PROJECT_ID}:${_REGION}:${_INSTANCE_NAME}", "-e", "SETTINGS_NAME=${_SECRET_SETTINGS_NAME}", "--", "python", "manage.py", "migrate",  ]  This step is self explanatory, we are running our migrations.   id: "collect static" name: "gcr.io google-appengine exec-wrapper" args: [  "-i", "gcr.io $PROJECT_ID ${_SERVICE_NAME}", "-s", "${PROJECT_ID}:${_REGION}:${_INSTANCE_NAME}", "-e", "SETTINGS_NAME=${_SECRET_SETTINGS_NAME}", "--", "python", "manage.py", "collectstatic", "--verbosity", "2", "--no-input"  ]  And lastly, we are running the collectstatic command. This command will be new to you but the idea behind this command is to copy all of the static assets  used  in  your  project   images,  css  and  js  files   and  put  them  in  your storage location  in our case this is cloud storage bucket. .  substitutions:  _INSTANCE_NAME: django-3-postgres-instance _REGION: us-central1 _SERVICE_NAME: blog-service _SECRET_SETTINGS_NAME: django_settings  Lastly,  in  this  section  we  have  defined  some  variables.  We  used  these variables  throughout  the  file.  Cloud  console  provides  a  number  of environment  the PROJECT_ID  you can see that we didn’t define it but still used it in this file  variable but it doesn’t provide every information we need which is why we created some of our own variables.  cloudmigrate.yml   including   variables   the   to   Note the following:     _INSTANCE_NAME:  refers  to  the  name  of  our  database   instance.  Not  that  I  am  not  talking  about  database,  but  database instance.  _REGION: This settings determines where our service will be hosted.  It  will  still  be  accessible  from  anywhere  in  the  world though. Keep it as it is.  _SERVICE_NAME:  This  is  the  name  we  want  to  give  our running application. I’ve called mine blog-serivce, you can name it whatever you want but keep it in mind as you’ll  have to use it in the near future.  _SECRET_SETTINGS_NAME:  This  is  the  name  of  the  secret where we stored our .env file. Deploying the Django App  Now our code is ready to be deployed.  Now head over to the root of your project  directory  and  run  this  command   Make  sure  you  put  your  database instance name in the highligted text :  gcloud  builds  submit  --config  cloudmigrate.yaml  --substitutions  _INSTANCE_NAME=django-3- postgres-instance,_REGION=us-central1  Running  this  command  will  build  our  docker  container,  run  migrations and collect static assets into the cloud storage bucket. This will also push our built container to Cloud Registry. You will see a number of messages logged to your console as shown below.     Now that our Docker container is built and available on cloud console,  run the following command to deploy Cloud Run service.  gcloud  run  deploy     --platform  managed  --region us-central1  --image  gcr.io    --add-cloudsql-instances   :us- central1:  --allow-unauthenticated  Make note of the highlighted content. Put your project’s values inside the  highlighted content. My command looks like this:  gcloud  run  deploy  blog-service  --platform  managed  --region  us-central1  --image  gcr.io django-3- 307211 blog-service  --add-cloudsql-instances  django-3-307211:us-central1:django-3-postgres-instance --allow-unauthenticated  Running  this  command,  you’re  code  will  be  deployed  as  a  cloud  run service and if everything goes successfull, you’ll receive a success message and  a  url  link  to  your  deployed  service.  I  received  the  link  https:  blog- service-tksu6kd5hq-uc.a.run.app.      For  security  concerns,  you  should  first  head  over  to  the  django  admin panel and login using the credentials we specified in our migrations file. If you  remember,  we  called  our  user  “admin”.  The  password  for  this  user  is stored in the superuser_password secret stored in secret manager. Use these credentials to log in and create a new user. Attaching a domain  Our code is live and our application works perfectly.The only thing left is to  hook  it  up  to  a  domain  name.  We  are  assuming  that  you  have  already bought a domain. We bought Our domain from Google Domains and have already  to cloud  https:  console.cloud.google.com run domains  project.  Head   linked   over   our   to   it   You should be taken to this screen. Make sure you are under the correct project  by  looking  at  the  dropdown  in  the  navgiation  bar.  Click  the  Add Mapping button. In the first dropdown, select our cloud run service that we deployed earlier. I named my service blog-service so I will select that. Next it will create another field between the two fields and ask you to verify your domain name.       Next, enter your domain name and it will ask you verify your domain.      Next  click  the  “VERIFY  IN  WEBMASTER  CENTRAL”  link  and  it  will take you to the following page:      From  the  dropdown,  select  your  domain  registrar.  Mine  is  Google Domains so I selected that. It will give you a string and you have to update your domain’s DNS record with the given string.    Copy this string and put it in the DNS records of your domain. The name   of the page on your domain registrar’s website may be something like DNS, Name Server Management, or Control Panel.  Since  I’m  using  Google  Domain,  I’ll  show  you  my  steps.  For  google domains,  to https:  domains.google.com registrar  .  So  for me it becomes. https:  domains.google.com registrar django3.org  head   over   Then head over to the DNS page and scroll down to the very bottom to the following section. In the first field, where it says Name, leave it empty. It will be @ by default. If your registrar is different, this field might be called Host or Alias. Next, select TXT as the type. In the TTL field, leave it set to default. In my case it is 1 hour. Lastly in the data field, enter the value you copied earlier from web master.    Hit add. Go back to the webmaster page from where you copied the string and click the verify button. It might give you an error saying it wasn’t able to verify your domain but wait a few minutes and try again. Now head back to the  page  where  we  were  adding  our  custom  mapping  and  hit  the  refresh button.        As you can see, it says it was verified successfully. Leave the subdomain field  as  blank  and  press  continue.  Next  it  will  show  you  the  following content.  You  need  to  update  the  DNS  records  on  your  domain  with  the  records provided. In case of Google Domain, you need to head back to the same page where you added the verification string. Add the records here. After adding the records, my DNS page becomes like so.      Now head back to the custom mapping page hit done.     Now you just need to wait for around 48 or so hours and you’ll be able to  access your web application through the domain https:  django3.org.  Finally,  you’ve  made  it!  You  are  a  queen king they!  Now,  there  is abosutely nothing between you and your dream Application! Below, you will   find some basic questions related to what we’ve learned so far.

DJANGO 3 FOR BEGINNERS Fascinated by the chronicles of modern computer language Python 3.9 and exploring developing web apps using the Python framework Django, the renowned writer, Dr. Andrey Bulezyuk has just launched his second book "Django 3 for Beginners". The first book, named "Algorithmisches Trading: Meta Trader4", is based on the MQL4 language and deals with the automation of stock trading systems. The book was well received among the IT & Investment sector and comprises of vast knowledge on the programming language presented in a simple easy-to-understand way. The Django 3 for Beginners focuses on the De Facto programming language, Python, the Django 3 Framework and ultimately deploying the Django 3 Application to the Cloud. The book defines and explains the programming language in baby steps, so that the beginners can comprehend and use Python as their launchpad. The book further discusses the Django 3 development and teaches the basics of the app development using Django 3. The book has deep insights on the application and use of the Django 3 development kit. It is a complete guide to the lifecycle of Django 3 App deployment in the Cloud. The book will make it simple to understand Python and Django 3 App development, an otherwise complicated and convoluted jargon. The writer Dr. Andrey Bulezyuk believes that web development has reached unimaginable heights in a very short time and it is continuing to do so at an incomprehensible rate. In order to keep up with the web development we need to stay updated and should learn only the most important topics, in order to iterate and launch quickly. The book is a great guide for those who are seeking to make their app based on Django 3 and is a step-by-step guide to deploy your app serverless[ly] in the cloud
