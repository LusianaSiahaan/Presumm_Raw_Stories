This book focuses on giving the reader a firm  understanding of the core concepts of Knockout, such as MVVM and data binding,  and works through real-life app development scenarios. All core components of  Knockout’s amazing library are covered in detail, and strategies are outlined for  getting the best use of time when developing with Knockout. This book contains the following sections:   Ê So, what is Knockout?– In this section you will get to know what Knockout does    and how you might start to benefit from its functionality.   Ê Installation – In five easy steps, you will see how you can be ready to start developing   with Knockout.   Ê Quick start – In this section you will learn to use Knockout to build an often needed   business tool – an inventory management app.   Ê Top features you need to know about – This section illustrates Knockout’s numerous   extension points and plethora of utilities to help smooth the process of building   your app.   Ê People and places you should get to know – Knockout’s core development team is   continually adding features and resources to help developers. You will learn, in this  section, how to access Knockout’s community and stay up to date in the future.    So, what is Knockout? In this section you will get to know what Knockout does and how you might start to benefit   from its functionality.  Knockout – A JavaScript library Knockout, at its core, is a simple JavaScript file that can be included in a website or a web  application to add JavaScript functionality, and provides the ability to enhance a user's  experience. By default, Knockout does nothing to your website or web application until  you specifically write code to utilize it. It is important to understand the difference between  Knockout and many other JavaScript "frameworks" or "libraries" as some frameworks actually  change how a website or web application works when included.  Knockout – A Model-View-ViewModel  MVVM  library One of the reasons that Knockout was created was for the specific goal of enabling   Model-View-ViewModel  MVVM  style development for websites and web applications.   MVVM is a style of development where different object classes are designed to separate   user-interface logic from business functions for testability purposes.  We strive to write testable code for many reasons  which is a topic for an entire other book ,   but the biggest reasons are maintainability of the code base and improved quality assurance.   As I've learned to write code in a testable way, I've seen my code bases become more idiomatic  and easier to maintain. If anything, building JavaScript applications with the MVVM pattern   has allowed me to deliver more reliable applications in a shorter time period compared to when   I was simply trying to sprinkle my HTML pages with DOM event handlers and unorganized  pieces of logic.  View  ViewModel  Model  3   The preceding diagram illustrates the common components and communication flow of an   MVVM architecture. We can see that Models, Views, and ViewModels are the building blocks   that we have to understand in order to derive benefit from the MVVM pattern. The first principle  of a MVVM-style application is defining the business Models. A Model is an object that usually  most directly represents a real-world object in the business system you are working in. It contains  properties and functions that have business-like names and reactions. If you were to make a Model  that represented an automobile, it would have properties such as:   Ê MaxSpeed  Number   Ê TireSize  Number   Ê ManufacturerName  String   It would also have functions such as:   Ê Honk  Ê DriveForward  The second principle of a MVVM-style application is the View. A View is the HTML markup that  describes the layout, elements  buttons, textboxes , colors, and other visual pieces of a portion  of the user interface. It has no logic or code embedded in it, and it is completely declarative    all needed parts of the view are described purely in the HTML markup .  The third part of a MVVM-style application is the ViewModel. The ViewModel provides the  connection between the View and the Model. If you were making a ViewModel for a View   that was designed to display automobiles, it might have properties such as:   Ê AutomobileCollection  Array   Ê SelectedAutomobile  Object   And it would have functions like:   Ê AddAutomobile  Ê SortAutomobiles  4   The ViewModel really allows you to keep business logic in your Model objects and create   the logic needed to power the user interface inside itself. The term for this is "Separation   of Concerns" and is incredibly useful with large  and small  web application architectures.  The final principle of MVVM is the concept of Binding. Binding is the idea of connecting the  properties and events of user interface elements  such as HTML elements  to functions and  properties of an object such as a ViewModel. An example of a binding would be the need to  connect a AddAutomobile button in the user interface with the ViewModel's AddAutomobile  function, or perhaps even connecting many user interface buttons to the single AddAutomobile  function on the ViewModel.  As Views in an MVVM application are almost always declarative in nature, bindings are often  declared in the View markup. Knockout is no different, and heavily utilizes HTML-compliant  "data-bind" declarations on HTML elements to enable its binding system.  The beauty of a solid MVVM library such as Knockout is that you can focus on developing the  business logic and critical functionality that your application or website needs rather than  spending critical time writing code to attach detach event handlers and manually update  textboxes when data values change.  5   Installation In five easy steps, you can be ready to start developing with Knockout!  Step 1 – What do I need? At the very least you will need the following in order to keep up with the examples in this guide:   Ê A web browser  Ê A text editor  Ê Roughly 2 megabytes  MB  of space on the computer of your choice  Ê A basic web server  explained as follows   Knockout development can be performed on most operating systems as long as you can install  and use the tools listed above.  For the purpose of this guide we will be using Google Chrome as my web browser. It is free and  can be installed on both, Windows and Mac operating systems. You can find it at http:  www. google.com chrome. My text editor of choice will actually take care of both my need for a text  editor and a webserver. I will be using Microsoft's WebMatrix development tool. It is free and  works on Windows operating systems. It can be downloaded from http:  www.microsoft. com web webmatrix . I will be using the IIS Express as the basic web server. It can be  downloaded from http:  www.microsoft.com en-us download details.aspx?id=1038.  If you have a Mac or Linux operating system, there are many great text editors and web servers  out there that you can download and install for free.  Step 2 – Create a starter site Now that we have our tools, we need to create a workbench for our application. I use the term  "workbench" as we will be creating and editing many different files as we work through this  guide. Some will be used simply for learning, while others will be part of the final application.  To start, I generally recommend creating a folder in a well-known spot  such as your computer  Desktop  to contain all of the files and folders that we will be using. My folder will usually end up  looking something like the following diagram:   Site   css  various css files    JS  various js files   Index.html  6   The JS folder will house all of our JavaScript files, and the CSS folder will house any CSS files  that we use in our Knockout app. We can create this site structure in a number of ways, but my  favorite way is to just visit http:  html5boilerplate.com  and download their starter site.   It provides a site structure  or Boilerplate  that includes many of the things you wouldn't want   to try and remember how to do  such as including a robots.txt file for your site .  Once you've created your Site folder, make sure to create a Index.html file. For the purpose  of this guide, ours will start out looking like the following HTML:                                Knockout Starter Guide                                               Hello World!                               This will be the starting point for developing our app. We have left placeholders for our JavaScript  and CSS files, and we have created a "Content" area for the majority of our markup to be placed.  7   Step 3 – Download Knockout Now the magic starts. In order to build a Knockout app, we obviously need to have the Knockout  JavaScript library, and the best way to do that is to just download it from the Knockout website  at http:  www.knockoutjs.com .  Once you are on the Knockout website, just click on the Download   Install link at the top of the  page, and follow the instructions on that page.  For the purposes of this guide, we will want to use the Knockout-2.1.0.debug.js  JavaScript file, and we will want to put it in the JS folder that we created earlier.  Step 4 – Create our main application JavaScript file Now we need to create a JavaScript file that will house all of the code for our application. We will  create a App.js JavaScript file and place it in the JS folder of our site. To start, this file will just  be an empty JavaScript as seen in the following sample:     main application code here  Now that we have Knockout downloaded and our main application JavaScript file created, we  need to include them in our Index.html page. When including JavaScript files, we simply add  them to the HTML of our page using the traditional HTML script tag. The following HTML  example illustrates how we use these at the bottom of the page to reference our JavaScript files.  8                                 Knockout Starter Guide                                               Hello World!                              <script type="text javascript" src=" JS knockout-2.1.0.debug. js">                      We are referencing these scripts at the bottom of the page for a few reasons. The first reason  is that it allows the page to appear to render faster to the end user because the entire visual  markup is processed before the script references are, and thus will be displayed on the web  browser's screen while the referenced JavaScript files are downloading and being processed into  the browser's memory. Secondly, Knockout is a library that works with the browser's Document  Object Model  DOM , and in order to do so, the browser needs to have created and rendered the  content portions of the DOM before Knockout executes. Many other very good reasons exist as  to why JavaScript files are referenced at the bottom of an HTML page, but that discussion is a  bit out of scope for this guide. So, simply as a best practice we place our JavaScript files at the  bottom of the page in order to give our users the best experience possible.  Step 5 – Run the application Now that we have our new site set up, let's run it and make sure everything works. As I am using  WebMatrix, I can just select the Index.html file and click on Run  on my Windows computer .  If you are using a different webserver, just start it with the root of the site being the site folder  that we created in the Step 2 – Create a starter site section, and then point your web browser at  the local URL your webserver is serving from.  9   You can see in the preceding screenshot that WebMatrix has selected to use port 11790 to serve  my files from, and so it will likely depend on the machine that you are working with. The Hello  World! that is currently displayed is simply the contents of our Index.html page. Great! We  have a working JavaScript application!  In order to make sure that our JavaScript files actually loaded and did not create any errors, we  need to fire up the browser's debugging tool and do a little investigation. In Chrome, I can open  the debugger by clicking on the wrench icon  upper-right corner  and going to Tools  Developer  Tools. The debugger will then take the bottom half of your browser window and look something  like the following screenshot:  If we click on the Sources tab of the debugger, we see what JavaScript files were loaded by the  page, and the contents of those pages. In the following screenshot, we can see that both our App. js file and our freshly downloaded Knockout library file are, in fact, loaded correctly by the page.  It is also important to note that there aren't any JavaScript errors on the page. We can see this by  noting that the lower-right corner of the debugger is free of any error alerts. If we did have some  errors on the page, you would see a red alert symbol with a number of errors inside of it.   10   If you are not using Chrome, you can simply search your browser's documentation online   to determine how it handles and displays JavaScript files and errors in its own debugger    or developer tools .  Summary You now have a functioning workbench for doing Knockout development. Congratulations!   In this section we have learned how to:   Ê Find, download, and install the basic tools needed to perform Knockout     and general HTML JavaScript  development   Ê Create a basic website from an empty file directory  Ê Download and install external JavaScript libraries, such as Knockout, into a website  Ê Create our JavaScript files and install them into a website  Ê Run a website locally on our machine for development and debugging purposes  11   Quick start Sometimes the best way to learn a library is to use it to solve real-world problems. In this   section we will learn to use Knockout to build an often needed business tool—an Inventory  Management app.  Business overview Before we can begin building our app, we need to have a firm understanding of the business  needs that our application will solve. The app needs to be able to do the following things:   Ê Track the Stock Keeping Unit  SKU  number and Description of each product that the   company sells   Ê Assign a price, cost, and on-hand quantity to each product  Ê Create new products when the company decides to sell them  Ê Remove old products when the company decides to stop selling them  Step 1 – Defining a namespace Now, before we begin to actually develop our app, it is important that we figure out how we  want to organize and separate our application code and logic from the rest of the browser's  objects and native functions. You might wonder why we care to do this in such a small example  application, but it is important to show JavaScript architecture best-practices whenever possible.  Using namespaces, even in a small app, ensures that if your application grows after if it is first  written  which many code-bases will , that it can remain easily maintainable and distinguishable  from third-party code  such as JavaScript plugins that you might use down the road .  We will define our namespace in the App.js file that we created previously. You can see in the  following code snippet, how we go about defining a namespace:     Define the namespace window.myApp = {};  Step 2 – Creating our Model Our first step is to create a Model that will represent our company's Product object. We can   do this by adding a file called Product.js to our JS folder. The contents of this file will look   like the following:   function  myApp  {         Product Constructor Function     function Product   {         var self = this;  12              "SKU" property         self.sku = ko.observable "" ;             "Description" property         self.description = ko.observable "" ;             "Price" property         self.price = ko.observable 0.00 ;             "Cost" property         self.cost = ko.observable 0.00 ;             "Quantity" property         self.quantity = ko.observable 0 ;     }         add to our namespace     myApp.Product = Product;  }  window.myApp  ;  In the preceding code snippet, we have defined a JavaScript function that will serve as the  constructor function for a Product class. As you can see, we have wrapped the definition   of our Product class in what is called an Immediately-Invoked Function Expression  IIFE .   We use this pattern for the following reasons:   Ê It allows the concept of JavaScript scope to prevent us from polluting the global   namespace  where objects such as window and document hangout . This way when  we are debugging, it doesn't look like our Product constructor is a native function   like window.   Ê It allows us to define private functions that aren't accessible by other code. If we   had defined the Product constructor, but never added it as a property to our myApp  namespace, then no code outside the IIFE wrapper would have access to our Product  constructor. This is ideal for creating functions that handle complex logic, but in a way  that prevents other objects from trying to utilize or overwrite that logic.  Inside the constructor function, each property is assigned to the self object. The self object  is just a variable that points back to the newly created Product instance. The this keyword in  JavaScript is very powerful, but sometimes confusing when it is used inside other functions, as it  can represent a number of objects  such as the global namespace, the function-calling object .  So to prevent confusion, we create a variable self, so that we can be sure it always points to  the correct instance of our object.  13   Finally, each property is set to an instance of a Knockout Observable. Observable is simply  Knockout's way of creating properties that can raise events when they change  which is a core  concept of Knockout that we will go in depth into later . By passing an initial value into this  function, we are returning a function object that wraps our initial value. We can get and set   a property by simply invoking this wrapper function. The following code does a great job   of showing how we can use our new Product constructor and its properties:     Usage     create an instance of the Product class var productA = new myApp.Product  ;     "set" the 'sku' property productA.sku '12345'      "get" the 'sku' property value var skuNumber = productA.sku  ;  Step 3 – Creating a View for our Model Now that we have defined our Product class, we need to create a way to let a user visually see  the Product on the screen. We will do this by creating an HTML view for the product. We will  start with a very simple HTML layout meant to show the values of a Product instance:            SKU:                     Description:                Cost:                Price:                Quantity:           Here we are simply just showing the values of our product using Knockout's text binding. The  text binding sets the innerText property of an HTML element  usually a span element  to  the string value of whatever object you are binding it to.  14   Step 4 – Creating a ViewModel to manage our Models At this point, we know that we will need to create logic around adding and deleting products  to our master product list. We also know that we will need some sort of an array to use as our  master product list. So, at this point we need to introduce a class that will allow us to manage all  of these functions, arrays, and objects that we will want to bind to the user-interface. The class  we need  as described before  is the ViewModel!  As we are building this app a little bit at a time, we will only give our ViewModel one property—a  selectedProduct. This property will represent the single product that we want to view the  details of on the screen. We add file to our JS folder called ProductsViewModel.js and then  add the following contents to that file:     Products ViewModel  function  myApp  {         constructor function     function ProductsViewModel   {         var self = this;             the product that we want to view edit         self.selectedProduct = ko.observable  ;     }         add our ViewModel to the public namespace     myApp.ProductsViewModel = ProductsViewModel;  }  window.myApp  ;  Step 5 – Working with Observable Arrays As we mentioned in our business needs, our company sells many different products, and so  we need to keep a list of these products. In JavaScript, the data structure used for maintaining  lists of objects or values is an Array. Knockout goes ahead and takes this one step farther by  providing us with an object called Observable Array. I will explain more on this object in the next  section, but this type of Array raises events when it changes  similar to Observable that we  described before . The events that the ObservableArray raises, allows Knockout to keep our  user-interface up-to-date whenever ObservableArray changes.  Knockout's ObservableArrays have all the standard native functions that normal JavaScript  arrays contain  push, pop, slice, splice , so they are very natural to work with if you have worked  with JavaScript Arrays before.  15   In order to create a master list of products for our company's application, we need to give our  ViewModel a new property—productCollection.     the product that we want to view edit         self.selectedProduct = ko.observable  ;                 the product collection         self.productCollection = ko.observableArray [] ;  Step 6 – Adding and removing Models from an   Observable Array Now that we have a master list of products for our company, we need to implement the logic   for adding and removing products from the master list.  The logic for adding products will stay relatively simple. It would be easy to add some   validation and other checks in this process, but I want to ensure it is as straightforward as  possible right now.     creates a new product and sets it up    for editing self.addNewProduct = function    {      create a new instance of a Product   var p = new myApp.Product  ;       set the selected Product to our new instance   self.selectedProduct p ; };     logic that is called whenever a user is done editing    a product or done adding a product self.doneEditingProduct = function    {      get a reference to our currently selected product   var p = self.selectedProduct  ;       ignore if it is null   if  !p  {     return;   }       check to see that the product      doesn't already exist in our list   if  self.productCollection.indexOf p  > -1  {     return;   }  16        add the product to the collection   self.productCollection.push p ;         clear out the selected product   self.selectedProduct null ; };  In this code example, we plan for the user to invoke the addNewProduct function, which will  populate our selectedProduct property with a new product ready for editing. When the user  is done editing the product, we plan for them to invoke the doneEditingProduct function,  which will take care of checking for null values, and then add it to our productCollection.  The logic for removing a product is pretty simple. We simply check for null values and then pull it  out of the collection, as shown in the following code:     logic that removes the selected product    from the collection self.removeProduct = function    {      get a reference to our currently selected product   var p = self.selectedProduct  ;       ignore if it is null   if  !p  {     return;   }       empty the selectedProduct   self.selectedProduct null ;       simply remove the item from the collection   return self.productCollection.remove p ; };  Finally we need to provide some buttons in the user-interface so that our users can actually  invoke this logic. We will add some buttons, and then bind the click event of those buttons to  their corresponding functions on the ViewModel as in the following example:                    SKU:                           Description:           17               Cost:                      Price:                      Quantity:                       Add<  button>      Remove<  button>      Done<  button>        Step 7 – Editing properties of a Model At this point we have no way of actually editing the properties of each product in our master list.  So we need to change our product view to utilize two-way bindings. Knockout's value binding  allows this, but we can only use this on input elements. So let's change the HTML of our  product view to be a little more like regular HTML forms:                     Product Details         SKU:                                        Description:                                   Cost:                                   Price:             18                          Quantity:                                 Our new form-based view now allows editing of selected product. I will mention at this point,  that you will definitely want to utilize some form of input validation to ensure that Cost and  Price are valid currency amounts, and that Quantity is a valid integer. However, that is a bit  out of scope of this guide and there are several great libraries out on the web for providing that  type of functionality.  Step 8 – Setting up a Master-Details view Finally, we now have the logic and HTML pieces for creating a very nice user-interface for  managing our company's inventory. Let's go ahead and put some finishing touches to our   app to create a nice Master-Details experience for our user.  First, let's make sure that our product view is correctly bound to our selected product,  and that the product view is only visible when we have a valid product instance selected.  Knockout provides a "with" binding that allows us to do exactly that. We will discuss these  bindings in more detail later, but the "with" binding allows us to both perform a null check  on the selectedProduct observable and change the binding context of the html from the  ProductsViewModel to the selectedProduct  so that we can directly reference those  properties in our data-bind statements .  As the Remove and Done buttons only make sense to be visible when we have a product  selected, we will add a visible binding to those buttons that checks whether the  selectedProduct property has a value. We can also do the exact opposite with the   Add button. One way of accomplishing this is shown in the following code:      <button type="button"      data-bind="click: addNewProduct,           visible:  selectedProduct   ? false : true ">Add    <button type="button"      data-bind="click: removeProduct,           visible:  selectedProduct   ? true : false ">Remove    <button type="button"      data-bind="click: doneEditingProduct,          visible:  selectedProduct   ? true : false ">Done     19   Finally, we need to provide our users with a way to view the master list of products that they are  managing. Often we see data grids, tables, unordered lists, or other widgets designed to display  lists of objects. Knockout is powerful enough, though, that we can actually just use raw HTML to  provide a view into our productCollection.  We are going to implement a basic list-view using a select element. Knockout provides a options  binding that allows us to bind an Observable Array to a select element. We will also set up a second  Observable in our ProductsViewModel to hold our new list-view's selected item. In order to  do that, we can simply use a value binding to bind the selected item of our select element to  this new property of our ProductsViewModel. The following code shows the added property,  listViewSelectedItem, along with a subscription that passes along any changes in the  listViewSelectedItem property to our main selectedProduct property:     the product that we want to view edit self.selectedProduct = ko.observable  ;     the product collection self.productCollection = ko.observableArray [] ;     product list view selected item self.listViewSelectedItem = ko.observable null ;     push any changes in the list view to our     main selectedProduct self.listViewSelectedItem.subscribe function  product  {   if  product  {     self.selectedProduct product ;   } } ;  Our list view is then implemented in HTML with the following code:      <select id="productList" size="10"       style="min-width:  120px;"       data-bind="options: productCollection,              value: listViewSelectedItem,              optionsText: 'sku'">        You can see in the preceding code that we can specify a optionsText binding that specifies  which property of each element in our Observable Array we want to appear in the select  element's options. Initially I've set this property to just be the Sku property of our Product  class—but what if I wanted to see both the Sku property and the Description property? We  can accomplish this with a Computed Observable. Again, we will go into deeper details about   20   Computed Observables, but for now we will simply add a Computed Observable that returns the  Sku property and the Description property of the Product class:     "Quantity" property self.quantity = ko.observable 0 ;     Computed Observables     simply combines the Sku and Description properties self.skuAndDescription = ko.computed function    {   var sku = self.sku    "";   var description = self.description    "";    return sku + ": " + description; } ;  After adding the skuAndDescription computed property to our Product class, we can  update our product list-view HTML. We just simply change the optionsText binding to now  point to the skuAndDescription property instead of the Sku property.  Step 9 – Applying bindings In order for our app to actually run, we need to kick-off the Knockout binding process. We need  to make sure to wait and invoke this process after all of our scripts have been loaded, and after  our ViewModel has been initialized. My suggested way is to set up this logic in the App.js file  like the following:     Define the namespace window.myApp = {};   function myApp {         constructor functio for App     function App  {                     core logic to run when all            dependencies are loaded         this.run = function  {                             create an instance of our ViewModel             var vm = new myApp.ProductsViewModel  ;                 tell Knockout to process our bindings              ko.applyBindings vm ;         }  21       }             make sure its public     myApp.App = App;  } window.myApp  ;      var app = new myApp.App  ;    app.run  ;    After we have created my initialization logic in my App.js file, we will then create an instance  of the app, and call the run function at the very bottom of the page, as shown in the following  code snippet:  For the purpose of this tutorial, I am placing this call at the very bottom of the page. We do have  other options, though, as to where we put this code. Another suggested option would be inside  of jQuery ready callback  a popular function in the jQuery library .  Summary After completing the previous steps, you have successfully created the Knockout JS app!  Congratulations! In this section we covered the following Knockout concepts and objects:   Ê Observables  Ê Observable Arrays  Ê Computed Observables  Ê The text, value, options, visible, click, and with bindings  Ê The ViewModel architecture  We quickly went through many of the core concepts of Knockout, and if you have   questions—that's OK—we will cover them in the following section.  22   Top features you need to to know about One of the best parts of Knockout is its extensibility. Knockout has numerous extension points and  contains a plethora of utilities for building your app. Many developers have built great Knockout  sites without any other JavaScript libraries  even jQuery  than the core Knockout library.  Subscribables When creating our Inventory Management app, it was easy to see that a Knockout Observable  is one of the core objects that Knockout was built around. However, under the covers of  Observables, Observable Arrays, and Computed Observables is Subscribable. A Subscribable is  simply an object that has three methods and an array of Subscriptions. The three methods are:   Ê subscribe: This adds a Subscription callback for a certain topic to be invoked when   subscriptions are "notified". The default topic is "changed".   Ê notifySubscribers: This calls all subscriptions for a certain topic and passes one   argument to all the Subscription's callbacks.   Ê extend: This applies an Extender to the Subscribable object.  The following code snippet shows an example of how the first two methods allow Subscribables  to perform basic Pub Sub functionality:  var test = ko.observable  ;     create a subscription for the "test-event" test.subscribe function  val  {        console.log val ; }, test, "test-event" ;  test.notifySubscribers "Hello World", "test-event" ;  One of the coolest abilities of a Knockout Subscribable is its ability to "mix-in" to any JavaScript  object. The following code example shows a great way that you can leverage the Knockout  Subscribable in some of your current code:      Dummy Subscribable function PubSub  {             inherit Subscribable     ko.subscribable.call this ; }     create an instance of our Subscribable var pubsub = new PubSub  ;  23      make a subscription var subscription = pubsub.subscribe function  val  {     console.log val ; }, pubsub, 'test-topic' ;  pubsub.notifySubscribers "hello world", "test-topic" ;    console: "hello world"     clean up things subscription.dispose  ;  Whenever we call the subscribe function of a Subscribable, we are returned a  Subscription. Often developers will ignore the Subscription that they are returned  from these calls, but it is important to understand that a Subscription allows you to  properly dispose of your Subscription's callback and also your app's other objects that are  referenced by that callback. Just simply calling dispose on your Subscription takes care of  this, and you can ensure that your app doesn't create memory leaks!  Now that you understand one of Knockout's absolute core building blocks, the Subscribable,  we can learn how Knockout extends its usage into other building blocks.  Observables The Knockout Observable is one of the first objects that leverages the Subscribable functionality,  and is one of the most simple, yet powerful pieces of the Knockout library. The following shows  the very basic idea of implementation of Observable:      Very Simple Knockout Observable Implementation     ko.observable is actually a function factory ko.observable = function  initialValue  {         private variable to hold the Observable's value     var _latestValue = initialValue;         the actual "Observable" function     function observable   {                     one or more args, so it's a Write         if  arguments.length > 0  {                             set the private variable             _latestValue = arguments[0];                 tell any subscribers that things have changed  24               observable["notifySubscribers"] _latestValue ;              return this;    Permits chained assignments         }         else {    no args, so it's a Read                             just hand back the private variable's value             return _latestValue;         }     }         inherit from Subscribable     ko.subscribable.call observable ;         return the freshly created Observable function     return observable; };  Again, this is very basic example implementation of the Knockout Observable  the actual  implementation has much more robust logic, equality checking, and dependency detection .  You can see from its implementation that the ko.observable function is essentially a function  factory. When you call this factory method, it generates a function  simply called observable   that provides a basic "get set" API. If you invoke the returned function without an argument,  then it returns the _initialValue, but if you invoke the function with an argument, it sets the  _initialValue to that argument and notifies all subscribers.  Observables are useful for just about anything you can imagine when building your application as  they are event-driven. We can build an application architecture that only worries about reacting to  events  such as a button click, or an input element's change event , rather than a procedural, single  entry-point type of code base.  Observable Arrays I briefly mentioned Observable Arrays earlier, and I promised that I would dig deeper into this  concept. While the previous example implementation of the Observable is relatively simple,   the Observable Array is even simpler, as shown in the following example implementation:     Very Simple Knockout Observable Array Implementation     function factory for observable arrays ko.observableArray = function  initialValues  {         make sure we have an array     initialValues = initialValues  [];  25          create a Knockout Observable around our Array     var result = ko.observable initialValues ;         add our Observable Array member functions        like "push", "pop", and so forth     ko.utils.extend result, ko.observableArray['fn'] ;         hand back the Observable we've created     return result; };  As you can see, it is really just an Observable, except that the value of Observable is an Array.  Functions have also been added to the Observable Array that match methods of a native Array.  The Knockout authors have done this in order to allow us as developers to be able to work with  an Observable Array in the same way we can work with normal Arrays.  A little known extensibility point is the fn property of the Observable Array constructing  function. You can add your own functions to this special property, and they will be included   on all Observable Arrays that your application uses. The following implementation shows   how we can easily add a function that filters items in the array:  ko.observableArray.fn['filter'] = function  filterFunc  {        get the array     var underlyingArray = this  ;     var result = [];      for  var i = 0; i < underlyingArray.length; i++  {         var value = underlyingArray[i];             execute filter logic         if  filterFunc value   {             result.push value ;         }     }     return result; };  var list = ko.observableArray [1, 2, 3] ;     filter down the list to only odd numbers var odds = list.filter function  item  {     return  item % 2 === 1 ; } ;  console.log odds ;    [1, 3]  26   The use of a fn property on constructor functions is a common pattern that you see in many  libraries  including jQuery , and Knockout is no different. The fn property also exists on the  Observable, so you can extend its functionality the same way.  Computed Observables Computed Observables are arguably the most powerful feature of Knockout. You may have  noticed that creating a ViewModel with nothing but Observables and Observable Arrays is a  huge step up from plain JavaScript, but it would be really nice to have other properties on your  ViewModel that simply depended upon other Observables and Observable Arrays and updated  themselves when their dependencies change.  Enter the Computed Observable  or in older versions of Knockout, the  dependentObservable . A Computed Observable looks to be very similar to a regular  Observable; however instead of holding a value, it contains a function that is used to evaluate  the return value of the Computed Observable. The evaluation function is only executed when the  Observables that it depends upon change. The following example shows a very basic example of  how this works.  var a = ko.observable 1 ; var b = ko.observable 2 ;  var sum = ko.computed function    {     var total = a   + b  ;         let's log every time this runs     console.log total ;     return total; } ;    console: 3  a 2 ;    console: 4 b 3 ;    console: 5 b 3 ;     nothing logged   Computed Observables have an extremely interesting and ingenious implementation,   which you can dig into on your own. However, there are a few important things to note.  First, Computed Observables build up a list of dependencies  or Subscriptions to be precise   when the evaluation function executes. If you want a certain Observable to be registered as  a subscription to your Computed Observable, then you need to ensure that the Observable is  always called in your evaluation function. The following example shows how you can set up a  changing dependency set for a Computed Observable:  var dep1 = ko.observable 1 ; var dep2 = ko.observable 2 ;  27   var skipDep1 = false;  var comp = ko.computed function    {     dep2  ;    register dep2 as dependency          if !skipDep1  {         dep1  ;    register dep1 as dependency     }      console.log 'evaluated' ; } ;    console: evaluated  dep1 99 ;    console: evaluated skipDep1 = true; dep2 98 ;    console: evaluated dep1 97 ;     nothing logged   Generally, it is a bad idea to do something like the previous example. It is extremely hard to debug,  and is not intuitive for other developers to realize what is going on. Instead, the suggested pattern  is to retrieve the value of each of your dependencies at the beginning of the evaluation function,  and then perform any conditional logic on private scoped variables after that.  Secondly, and this applies to Observables in general, a subscription callback will only be called  if the Observable determines that the before and after values are different. Each Observable  has a property called equalityComparer which determines if the before and after values  of an Observable are in fact different. If you notice in the first example, the very last call to  set the value of b did nothing. This is because b was already 3 and had no reason to notify  its subscriptions. The default equalityComparer of each Observable is a function that  only compares JavaScript primitives. So to make that simple, if a Computed Observable's  dependencies are all objects, complex or not, the evaluator function will be re-executed every  time one of its dependencies change. The following example provides an illustration of this  important concept:  var depPrimitive = ko.observable 1 ; var depObj = ko.observable { val: 1 } ;  var comp = ko.computed function    {        register dependencies     var prim = depPrimitive  ;     var obj = depObj  ;      console.log "evaluated" ; } ;  28      console: evaluated  depPrimitive 1 ;     nothing logged  var previous = depObj  ; depObj previous ;    console: evaluated  It is important to understand this because many novice Knockout developers hurt themselves  by overusing Computed Observables and accidentally building long event chains that ultimately  lead to slow-performing applications.  Lastly, Computed Observables can have both an evaluation function for "setting" and "getting"  their values. This is incredibly useful, because it allows us to have private Observable fields on  our ViewModel that are protected through publicly exposed "get set" functions and we also get  the power of a normal Observable. In the following code you can see an example of this   useful concept:  var _val = ko.observable 1 ;  var vm = {     val: ko.computed {         read: function    {             return _val  ;         },         write: function  newVal  {             _val newVal ;         }     }  };  vm.val 2 ; console.log _val   ;    console: 2  _val 3 ; console.log vm.val   ;    console: 3  Utilities Knockout is full of many useful utilities that you can use in your application development.   You can find these by exploring the ko.utils namespace, but some of my favorite utilities   are as follows:   Ê extend: This function "mashes" two objects together. Essentially all of the    properties and functions of the second argument to this function call are added   to the first argument.  29    Ê unwrapObservable: This function takes an object property and intelligently returns  its value, figuring out whether it is a Knockout Observable or just a simple property. It is  extremely useful if you have to write functions that might take an object, a primitive, or  an Observable as an argument and you need it to figure that out properly at runtime.   Ê All of the Array utilities: Knockout has several Array-manipulation functions that allow   you to do filtering, mapping, and removing items. I usually add these utilities to the  special ko.observableArray.fn property when I first start a project.  The following shows some example usage of these utilities:     extend usage var a = { val: 1 },     b = { val: 2 };  ko.utils.extend a, b ;  console.log a.val ;    console: 2     unwrapObservable usage var c = ko.observable 99 ,     d = 98;  console.log ko.utils.unwrapObservable c  ;    console: 99 console.log ko.utils.unwrapObservable d  ;    console: 98     array "map" utility function usage var arr = [100, 101];  var mapped = ko.utils.arrayMap arr, function  item  {     return item + 50; }   console.log arr ;    console: [ 150, 151 ]  Data-bind statements So far, we've focused on quite a bit of the JavaScript components of the Knockout library.  However, Knockout was designed to make binding JavaScript objects and HTML extremely   easy. The API that is given to us to use is through the HTML5 compliant data-bind statement.  30   From the examples in our previous app, you may think that all the data-bind statements  are simply matching an HTML element's attribute to a property of our ViewModel. In actuality,  though, the data-bind syntax supports quite a bit more. We can actually implement small bits  of JavaScript in these statements, and it will be evaluated correctly at runtime. The data-bind  statement also allows declaring a comma-separated list of binding declarations. The following  implementation shows some of the allowed syntaxes for data-bind statements on   HTML elements:          <input data-bind="value: someVal,                    css: {                      'error': !someVal.isValid  ,                      'success': someVal.isValid                      }" >  Applying bindings The applyBindings function is where all of the Knockout magic gets kicked off. Many  examples show the applyBindings function being called with a ViewModel object being  passed in as the only argument, but you can also specify a DOM node as the second argument.  When passing a DOM node as the second argument, Knockout only binds your ViewModel to  that node and its children.  Most basic applications are fine with only having one ViewModel, and just simply calling  applyBindings with that single ViewModel. However, I've built several complex applications  where we used multiple ViewModels for one page. It is important to consider the advantages  of having a separate ViewModel in your application for, alerts, settings, and current user  information. In some cases, you can also gain performance benefits by limiting the number of  nodes that Knockout has to walk in order to finish its binding process. If you are only enhancing  a small portion of your HTML page with Knockout, don't call applyBindings blindly across the  entire DOM.  Binding handlers I've mentioned Knockout's amazing extensibility points, and few are better than Knockout's  binding handler objects. Every Knockout binding that you see in a data-bind statement is  implemented as a binding handler, and Knockout allows us to define our own binding handlers  so that we can implement, or override, our own custom functionality.  31   With MVVM-style application development, we have two types of bindings—one-way bindings  and two-way bindings. One-way bindings are simply read-only bindings, and are for pushing  a ViewModel's property updates through to the DOM. You can probably guess that two-way  bindings are bindings that take that one step further and allow DOM changes to be pushed  back through to a ViewModel's property. Knockout allows us to create both of these types of  bindings. The following shows a very basic template for a binding handler:  ko.bindingHandlers['myHandler'] = {      init: function element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor,  viewModel, bindingContext {              },      update: function element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor,  viewModel, bindingContext {              } };  As we can see, we are provided two hooks for implementing our own logic—init and update  functions that have the same signature. The arguments for those functions are as follows:   Ê element: The HTML element that the data-bind statement is declared on.  Ê valueAccessor: A function that returns the ViewModel value to which the binding   is set. If the binding is set to an Observable property, then the Observable is returned   and we'll need to unwrap within our logic .   Ê allBindingsAccessor: Similar to the valueAccessor, but it returns an object   that contains all the bindings and their respective bound values.   Ê viewModel: The ViewModel or root object that was passed into the    applyBindings statement.   Ê bindingContext: A special object that has specific properties that represent the  data context of the current binding. The binding context has a $data property that  represents the currently bound context  which most often would be same as the  ViewModel argument . It also has $parent and $parents properties that represent  any data contexts that may be bound to elements higher in the DOM tree. We usually  only use the parent properties if we have used the with binding in our application.  You might be wondering, which functions we should implement our custom logic in since  they both look to do the same thing. The init function will be called only once when  applyBindings function has been called. Knockout walks the DOM, finds data-bind  statements, processes them, and calls the init method on each binding handler that is needed.  The update function is then called immediately after the init function is called, and then also  whenever the value it is bound to changes  if the value is a Subscribable .  32   My rule-of-thumb for binding handlers is that I register all of my event handlers  change, blur,  focus  in the init function, then I perform my HTML manipulation in the update function.  The following code snippet shows a common one-way binding that I add to my projects.   It simply reverses the Boolean logic of the visible binding so that I can handle situations  where a ViewModel property makes more sense to be developed as vm.isHidden  ; instead  of vm.isVisible  ;.     invisible -> the inverse of 'visible' ko.bindingHandlers['invisible'] = {     update: function  element, valueAccessor  {         var newValueAccessor = function    {                just return the opposite of the visible flag!             return !ko.utils.unwrapObservable valueAccessor   ;         };         return ko.bindingHandlers.visible.update element,  newValueAccessor ;     } };  The following code snippet shows a two-way binding that I use for ensuring I have a valid  number. It manually handles the updates from the UI and pushes those to the ViewModel,   and then also updates the UI when the ViewModel changes.     simple number parsing function parseNumber strVal {     return parseInt strVal, 10 ; }     very basic two-way binding handler ko.bindingHandlers['number'] = {     init: function  element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor  {            handle the input changing         ko.utils.registerEventHandler element, "change", function    {             var observable = valueAccessor  ;             var number = parseNumber element.value ;              if  number !== NaN  {                 observable element.value ;             }         } ;     },     update: function  element, valueAccessor  {         var value = ko.utils.unwrapObservable valueAccessor   ;  33           var number = parseNumber value ;          if  number !== NaN  {             element.setAttribute "value", number ;         }     } };   Summary All in all you can see that Knockout is a very mature and thorough JavaScript library.
