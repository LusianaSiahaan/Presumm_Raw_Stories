The reason behind this is that TDD is difficult to master. Even though the theory is very easy to grasp, it takes a lot of practice to become really proficient with it. The authors of this book have been practicing TDD for years and will try to pass on their experience to you. They are developers and believe that the best way to learn some coding practice is through code and constant practice. This book follows the same philosophy. We'll explain all the TDD concepts through exercises. This will be a journey through TDD best practices applied to Java development. At the end of it, you will earn a TDD black belt and have one more tool in your software craftsmanship tool belt. Who this book is for If you're an experienced Java developer and want to implement more effective methods of programming systems and applications, then this book is for you. What this book covers Chapter 1, Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?, spells out our goal of becoming a Java developer with a TDD black belt. In order to know where we're going, we'll have to discuss and find answers to some questions that will define our voyage.  Chapter 2, Tools, Frameworks, and Environments, will compare and set up all the tools, frameworks and environments that will be used throughout this book. Each of them will be accompanied with code that demonstrates their strengths and weaknesses.   Chapter 3, Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection, will help us develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game using the red-green-refactor technique, which is the pillar of TDD. We'll write a test and see it fail; we'll write a code that implements that test, run all the tests, and see them succeed; and finally, we'll refactor the code and try to make it better.  Chapter 4, Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done, shows that to demonstrate the power of TDD applied to unit testing, we'll need to develop a remote-controlled ship. We'll learn what unit testing really is, how it differs from functional and integration tests, and how it can be combined with test-driven development.   Preface  Chapter 5, Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well, will help us develop a Connect 4 game without any tests and try to write tests at the end. This will give us insights into the difficulties we are facing when applications are not developed in a way that they can be tested easily.  Chapter 6, Mocking – Removing External Dependencies, shows how TDD is about speed. We want to quickly demonstrate some idea concept. We'll continue developing our Tic-Tac-Toe game by adding MongoDB as our data storage. None of our tests will actually use MongoDB since all communications to it will be mocked.  Chapter 7, TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match, dives into the functional programming paradigm and how TDD could be applied when programming in that way. We'll explore parts of the functional API provided by Java since version 8 and create readable and meaningful tests.  Chapter 8, BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team, discusses developing a book store application by using the BDD approach. We'll define the acceptance criteria in the BDD format, carry out the implementation of each feature separately, confirm that it is working correctly by running BDD scenarios, and if required, refactor the code to accomplish the desired level of quality.  Chapter 9, Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again, will help us refactor an existing application. The process will start with creation of test coverage for the existing code and from there on, we'll be able to start refactoring until both the tests and the code meet our expectations.  Chapter 10, Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production, will show us how to develop a Fibonacci calculator and use feature toggles to hide functionalities that are not fully finished or that, for business reasons, should not yet be available to our users.  Chapter 11, Putting It All Together, will walk you through all the TDD best practices in detail and refresh the knowledge and experience you gained throughout this book.  Chapter 12, Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery, explains how TDD and continuous delivery form a very powerful combination that leads to better and faster software deliveries. Some of the problems that companies are facing nowadays are illustrated with an example of a fictitious company. At the end, the speed of the development is increased and some of the pain points are mitigated by the implementation of an effective development pipeline based on automated tests and continuous delivery.

As such, most of the learning will be through code. Each chapter will present one or more test-driven development  TDD  practices and we'll try to master them by solving katas. In karate, a kata is an exercise where you repeat a form many times, making little improvements in each. Following the same philosophy, we'll be making small, but significant improvements from one chapter to the next. You'll learn how to design and code better, reduce time to market  TTM , produce  always up-to-date documentation, obtain high code coverage through quality tests, and write clean code that works.  Every journey has a start and this one is no exception. Our destination is a Java developer with the TDD black belt.  In order to know where we're going, we'll have to discuss, and find answers, to some questions that will define our voyage. What is TDD? Is it a testing technique, or something else? What are the benefits of applying TDD?  The goal of this chapter is to obtain an overview of TDD, to understand what it is, and to grasp the benefits it provides for its practitioners.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  Understanding TDD What is TDD? Testing   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  Mocking Executable documentation No debugging  Why TDD? You might be working in an agile or waterfall environment. Maybe you have well-defined procedures that were battle-tested through years of hard work, or maybe you just started your own start-up. No matter what the situation was, you likely faced at least one, if not more, of the following pains, problems, or causes for unsuccessful delivery:  Part of your team is kept out of the loop during the creation of requirements, specifications, or user stories Most, if not all, of your tests are manual, or you don't have tests at all Even though you have automated tests, they do not detect real problems Automated tests are written and executed when it's too late for them to provide any real value to the project There is always something more urgent than dedicating time to testing Teams are split between testing, development, and functional analysis departments, and they are often out of sync There is an inability to refactor the code because of the fear that something will be broken The maintenance cost is too high The time to market is too big Clients do not feel that what was delivered is what they asked for Documentation is never up-to-date You're afraid to deploy to production because the result is unknown You're often not able to deploy to production because regression tests take too long to run The team is spending too much time trying to figure out what some method or a class does  TDD does not magically solve all of these problems. Instead, it puts us on the way towards the solution. There is no silver bullet, but if there is one development practice that can make a difference on so many levels, that practice is TDD.  [ 7 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  TDD speeds up the time to market, enables easier refactoring, helps to create better design, and fosters looser coupling.  On top of the direct benefits, TDD is a prerequisite for many other practices  continuous delivery being one of them . Better design, well-written code, faster TTM, up-to-date documentation, and solid test coverage, are some of the results you will accomplish by applying TDD.  It's not an easy thing to master TDD. Even after learning all the theory and going through best practices and anti-patterns, the journey is only just beginning. TDD requires time and a lot of practice. It's a long trip that does not stop with this book. As a matter of fact, it never truly ends. There are always new ways to become more proficient and faster. However, even though the cost is high, the benefits are even higher. People who have spent enough time with TDD claim that there is no other way to develop a software. We are one of them and we're sure that you will be too.  We are strong believers that the best way to learn some coding technique is by coding. You won't be able to finish this book by reading it in a metro on the way to work. It's not a book that one can read in bed. You'll have to get your hands dirty and code.  In this chapter, we'll go through basics; starting from the next, you'll be learning by reading, writing, and running code. We'd like to say that by the time you're finished with this book, you'll be an experienced TDD programmer, but this is not true. By the end of this book, you'll be comfortable with TDD and you'll have a strong base in both theory and practice. The rest is up to you and the experience you'll be building by applying it in your day-to-day job.  Understanding TDD At this time, you are probably saying to yourself, OK, I understand that TDD will give me some benefits, but what exactly is TDD? TDD is a simple procedure of writing tests before the actual implementation. It's an inversion of a traditional approach where testing is performed after the code is written.  Red-Green-Refactor TDD is a process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. It is based on the test-first concept of extreme programming  XP  that encourages simple design with a high-level of confidence. The procedure that drives this cycle is called Red-Green-Refactor.  [ 8 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  The procedure itself is simple and it consists of a few steps that are repeated over and over again:  1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.  Write a test Run all tests Write the implementation code Run all tests Refactor Run all tests  Since a test is written before the actual implementation, it is supposed to fail. If it doesn't, the test is wrong. It describes something that already exists or it was written incorrectly. Being in the green state while writing tests is a sign of a false positive. Tests like these should be removed or refactored.  While writing tests, we are in the red state. When the implementation of a test is finished, all tests should pass and then we will be in the green state.  If the last test failed, the implementation is wrong and should be corrected. Either the test we just finished is incorrect or the implementation of that test did not meet the specification we had set. If any but the last test failed, we broke something and changes should be reverted.  When this happens, the natural reaction is to spend as much time as needed to fix the code so that all tests are passing. However, this is wrong. If a fix is not done in a matter of minutes, the best thing to do is to revert the changes. After all, everything worked not long ago. An implementation that broke something is obviously wrong, so why not go back to where we started and think again about the correct way to implement the test? That way, we wasted minutes on a wrong implementation instead of wasting much more time to correct something that was not done right in the first place. Existing test coverage  excluding the implementation of the last test  should be sacred. We change the existing code through intentional refactoring, not as a way to fix recently written code.  [ 9 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  Do not make the implementation of the last test final, but provide just enough code for this test to pass.  Write the code in any way you want, but do it fast. Once everything is green, we have confidence that there is a safety net in the form of tests. From this moment on, we can proceed to refactor the code. This means that we are making the code better and more optimal without introducing new features. While refactoring is in place, all tests should be passing all the time.  If, while refactoring, one of the tests failed, refactoring broke an existing functionality and, as before, changes should be reverted. Not only that, at this stage we are not changing any features, but we are also not introducing any new tests. All we're doing is making the code better while continuously running all tests to make sure that nothing got broken. At the same time, we're proving code correctness and cutting down on future maintenance costs.  Once refactoring is finished, the process is repeated. It's an endless loop of a very short cycle.  Speed is the key Imagine a game of ping pong  or table tennis . The game is very fast; sometimes it is hard even to follow the ball when professionals play the game. TDD is very similar. TDD veterans tend not to spend more than a minute on either side of the table  test and implementation . Write a short test and run all tests  ping , write the implementation and run all tests  pong , write another test  ping , write the implementation of that test  pong , refactor and confirm that all tests are passing  score , and then repeat—ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, pong, score, serve again. Do not try to make the perfect code. Instead, try to keep the ball rolling until you think that the time is right to score  refactor .  Time between switching from tests to implementation  and vice versa  should be measured in minutes  if not seconds .  [ 10 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  It's not about testing T in TDD is often misunderstood. TDD is the way we approach the design. It is the way to force us to think about the implementation and what the code needs to do before writing it. It is the way to focus on requirements and the implementation of just one thing at a time—organize your thoughts and better structure the code. This does not mean that tests resulting from TDD are useless—they are far from that. They are very useful and they allow us to develop with great speed without being afraid that something will be broken. This is especially true when refactoring takes place. Being able to reorganize the code while having the confidence that no functionality is broken is a huge boost to its quality.  The main objective of TDD is testable code design with tests as a very useful side product.  Testing Even though the main objective of TDD is the approach to code design, tests are still a very important aspect of TDD and we should have a clear understanding of two major groups of techniques, as follows:  Black-box testing White-box testing  Black-box testing Black-box testing  also known as functional testing  treats software under test as a black box without knowing its internals. Tests use software interfaces and try to ensure that they work as expected. As long as the functionality of interfaces remains unchanged, tests should pass even if internals are changed. The tester is aware of what the program should do, but does not have the knowledge of how it does it. Black-box testing is the most commonly used type of testing in traditional organizations that have testers as a separate department, especially when they are not proficient in coding and have difficulties understanding it. This technique provides an external perspective on the software under test.  [ 11 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  Some of the advantages of black-box testing are as follows:  It is efficient for large segments of code Code access, understanding the code, and ability to code are not required It offers separation between users and developers perspectives  Some of the disadvantages of black-box testing are as follows:  It provides limited coverage, since only a fraction of test scenarios is performed It can result in inefficient testing due to tester's lack of knowledge about software internals It can lead to blind coverage, since testers have limited knowledge about the application  If tests are driving the development, they are often done in the form of acceptance criteria that is later used as a definition of what should be developed.  Automated black-box testing relies on some form of automation, such as behavior-driven development  BDD .  White-box testing White-box testing  also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing  looks inside the software that is being tested and uses that knowledge as part of the testing process. If, for example, an exception should be thrown under certain conditions, a test might want to reproduce those conditions. White-box testing requires internal knowledge of the system and programming skills. It provides an internal perspective on the software under test.  Some of the advantages of white-box testing are as follows:  It is efficient in finding errors and problems Required knowledge of internals of the software under test is beneficial for thorough testing It allows finding hidden errors  [ 12 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  It encourages programmer's introspection It helps in optimizing the code Due to the required internal knowledge of the software, maximum coverage is obtained  Some of the disadvantages of white-box testing are as follows:  It might not find unimplemented or missing features It requires high-level knowledge of internals of the software under test It requires code access Tests are often tightly coupled to the implementation details of the production code, causing unwanted test failures when the code is refactored  White-box testing is almost always automated and, in most cases, take the form of unit tests.  When white-box testing is done before the implementation, it takes the form of TDD.  The difference between quality checking and quality assurance The approach to testing can also be distinguished by looking at the objectives they are  trying to accomplish. Those objectives are often split between quality checking  QC  and quality assurance  QA . While QC is focused on defects identification, QA tries to prevent them. QC is product-oriented and intends to make sure that results are as expected. On the other hand, QA is more focused on processes that assure that quality is built-in. It tries to make sure that correct things are done in the correct way.  While QC had a more important role in the past, with the emergence of TDD, acceptance test-driven development  ATDD , and later on BDD, focus has been shifting towards QA.  [ 13 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  Better tests No matter whether one is using black-box, white-box, or both types of testing, the order in which they are written is very important.  Requirements  specifications and user stories  are written before the code that implements them. They come first so they define the code, not the other way around. The same can be said for tests. If they are written after the code is done, in a certain way, that code  and the functionalities it implements  is defining tests. Tests that are defined by an already existing application are biased. They have a tendency to confirm what code does, and not to test whether a client's expectations are met, or that the code is behaving as expected. With manual testing, that is less the case since it is often done by a siloed QC department  even though it's often called QA . They tend to work on test definition in isolation from developers. That in itself leads to bigger problems caused by inevitably poor  communication and the police syndrome, where testers are not trying to help the team to write applications with quality built in, but to find faults at the end of the process. The sooner we find problems, the cheaper it is to fix them.  Tests written in the TDD fashion  including its flavors such as ATDD and BDD  are an attempt to develop applications with quality built in from the very start. It's an attempt to avoid having problems in the first place.  Mocking In order for tests to run quickly and provide constant feedback, code needs to be organized in such a way that the methods, functions, and classes can be easily replaced with mocks and stubs. A common word for this type of replacements of the actual code is test double. The speed of execution can be severely affected with external dependencies; for example, our code might need to communicate with the database. By mocking external dependencies, we are able to increase that speed drastically. Whole unit test suite execution should be measured in minutes, if not seconds. Designing the code in a way that can be easily mocked and stubbed forces us to structure that code better by applying a separation of concerns.  More important than speed is the benefit of the removal of external factors. Setting up databases, web servers, external APIs, and other dependencies that our code might need, is both time consuming and unreliable. In many cases, those dependencies might not even be available. For example, we might need to create a code that communicates with a database and have someone else create a schema. Without mocks, we would need to wait until that schema is set.  [ 14 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  With or without mocks, the code should be written in such a way that we can easily replace one dependency with another.  Executable documentation Another very useful aspect of TDD  and well-structured tests in general  is documentation. In most cases, it is much easier to find out what the code does by looking at tests than at the implementation itself. What is the purpose of some methods? Look at the tests associated with it. What is the desired functionality of some part of the application UI? Look at the tests associated with it. Documentation written in the form of tests is one of the pillars of TDD and deserves further explanation.  The main problem with  traditional  software documentation is that it is not up-to-date most of the time. As soon as some part of the code changes, the documentation stops reflecting the actual situation. This statement applies to almost any type of documentation, with requirements and test cases being the most affected.  The necessity to document code is often a sign that the code itself is not well-written. Moreover, no matter how hard we try, documentation inevitably gets outdated.  Developers shouldn't rely on system documentation because it is almost never up-to-date. Besides, no documentation can provide as detailed and up-to-date a description of the code as the code itself.  Using code as documentation does not exclude other types of documents. The key is to avoid duplication. If details of the system can be obtained by reading the code, other types of documentation can provide quick guidelines and a high-level overview. Non-code documentation should answer questions such as what the general purpose of the system is and what technologies are used by the system. In many cases, a simple README is enough to provide the quick start that developers need. Sections such as project description, environment setup, installation, and build and packaging instructions are very helpful for newcomers. From there on, code is the bible.  Implementation code provides all needed details while test code acts as the description of the intent behind the production code.  [ 15 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  Tests are executable documentation with TDD being the most common way to create and maintain it.  Assuming that some form of continuous integration  CI  is in use, if some part of the test documentation is incorrect, it will fail and be fixed soon afterwards. CI solves the problem of incorrect test documentation, but it does not ensure that all functionality is documented. For this reason  among many others , test documentation should be created in the TDD fashion. If all functionality is defined as tests before the implementation code is written and the execution of all tests is successful, then tests act as a complete and up-to-date information source that can be used by developers.  What should we do with the rest of the team? Testers, customers, managers, and other non- coders might not be able to obtain the necessary information from the production and test code.  As we saw earlier, two of the most common types of testing are black-box and white-box testing. This division is important since it also divides testers into those who do know how to write or at least read code  white-box testing  and those who don't  black-box testing . In some cases, testers can do both types. However, more often than not, they do not know how to code so the documentation that is usable by developers is not usable by them. If documentation needs to be decoupled from the code, unit tests are not a good match. That is one of the reasons why BDD came in to being.  BDD can provide documentation necessary for non-coders, while still maintaining the advantages of TDD and automation.  Customers need to be able to define new functionality of the system, as well as to be able to get information about all the important aspects of the current system. That documentation should not be too technical  code is not an option , but it still must be always up-to-date. BDD narratives and scenarios are one of the best ways to provide this type of documentation. The ability to act as acceptance criteria  written before the code , be executed frequently  preferably on every commit , and be written in a natural language makes BDD stories not only always up-to-date, but usable by those who do not want to inspect the code.  [ 16 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  Documentation is an integral part of the software. As with any other part of the code, it needs to be tested often so that we're sure that it is accurate and up-to-date.  The only cost-effective way to have accurate and up-to-date information is to have executable documentation that can be integrated into your CI system.  TDD as a methodology is a good way to move along in this direction. On a low-level, unit tests are a best fit. On the other hand, BDD provides a good way to work on a functional level while maintaining understanding that is accomplished by using natural language.  No debugging We  authors of this book  almost never debug applications we're working on!  This statement might sound pompous, but it's true. We almost never debug because there is rarely a reason to debug an application. When tests are written before the code and the code coverage is high, we can have high confidence that the application works as expected. This does not mean that applications written using TDD do not have bugs—they do. All applications do. However, when that happens, it is easy to isolate them by simply looking for the code that is not covered by tests.  Tests themselves might not include some cases. In those situations, the action is to write additional tests.  With high code coverage, finding the cause of some bug is much faster through tests than spending time debugging line by line until the culprit is found.  [ 17 ]   Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?  Chapter 1  Summary In this chapter, you got the general understanding of TDD practice and insights into what TDD is and what it isn't. You learned that it is a way to design code through a short and repeatable cycle called Red-Green-Refactor. Failure is an expected state that should not only be embraced, but enforced throughout the TDD process. This cycle is so short that we move from one phase to another with great speed.  While code design is the main objective, tests created throughout the TDD process are a valuable asset that should be utilized and severely impact our view of traditional testing practices. We went through the most common of those practices, such as white-box and black-box testing, tried to put them into the TDD perspective, and showed benefits that they can bring to each other.  You discovered that mocks are very important tools that are often a must when writing tests. Finally, we discussed how tests can and should be utilized as executable documentation and how TDD can make debugging much less necessary.  Now that we are armed with theoretical knowledge, it is time to set up the development environment and get an overview and comparison of different testing frameworks and tools.  [ 18 ]   2  Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  "We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us."  – Marshall McLuhan  As every soldier knows his weapons, a programmer must be familiar with the development ecosystem and those tools that make programming much easier. Whether you are already using any of these tools at work or home, it is worth taking a look at many of them and comparing their features, advantages, and disadvantages. Let's get an overview of what we can find nowadays about the following topics and construct a small project to get familiar with some of them.  We won't go into the details of those tools and frameworks, since that will be done later on in the following chapters. The goal is to get you up and running, and provide you with a short overview of what they do and how.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  Git Virtual machines Build tools The integrated development environment Unit testing frameworks Hamcrest and AssertJ   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  Code coverage tools Mocking frameworks User interface testing Behavior-driven development  Git Git is the most popular revision control system. For that reason, all the code used in this book is stored in Bitbucket  https:  bitbucket.org  . If you don't have it already, install Git. Distributions for all the popular operating systems can be found at: http:  git-scm.com.  Many graphical interfaces are available for Git; some of them being Tortoise  https:  code.google.com p tortoisegit , Source Tree  https:  www.sourcetreeapp.com , and Tower  http:  www.git-tower.com  .  Virtual machines Even though they are outside the topic of this book, virtual machines are a powerful tool and a first-class citizen in a good development environment. They provide dynamic and easy-to-use resources in isolated systems so they can be used and dropped at the time we need them. This helps developers to focus on their tasks instead of wasting their time creating or installing required services from scratch. This is the reason why virtual machines have found room in here. We want to take advantage of them to keep you focused on the code.  In order to have the same environment no matter the OS you're using, we'll be creating virtual machines with Vagrant and deploying required applications with Docker. We chose Ubuntu as a base operating system in our examples, just because it is a popular, commonly used Unix-like distribution. Most of these technologies are platform-independent, but occasionally you won't be able to follow the instructions found here because you might be using some other operating system. In that case, your task is to find what the differences are between Ubuntu and your operating system and act accordingly.  [ 20 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  Vagrant Vagrant is the tool we are going to use for creating the development environment stack. It is an easy way to initialize ready-to-go virtual machines with minimum effort using preconfigured boxes. All boxes and configurations are placed in one file, called the Vagrant file.  Here is an example of creating a simple Ubuntu box. We made an extra configuration for installing MongoDB using Docker  the usage of Docker will be explained shortly . We assume that you have VirtualBox  https:  www.virtualbox.org  and Vagrant  https:  www.vagrantup.com  installed on your computer and that you have internet access.  In this particular case, we are creating an instance of Ubuntu 64-bits using the Ubuntu box  ubuntu trusty64  and specifying that the VM should have 1 GB of RAM:    config.vm.box = "ubuntu trusty64"   config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do vb   vb.memory = "1024"   end  Further on, we're exposing MongoDB's default port in the Vagrant machine and running it using Docker:    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 27017, host: 27017   config.vm.provision "docker" do d     d.run "mongoDB", image: "mongo:2", args: "-p 27017:27017"   end  Finally, in order to speed up the Vagrant setup, we're caching some resources. You should install the plugin called cachier. For further information, visit: https:  github.com fgrehm vagrant-cachier.    if Vagrant.has_plugin? "vagrant-cachier"      config.cache.scope = :box   end  Now it's time to see it working. It usually takes a few minutes to run it for the first time because the base box and all the dependencies need to be downloaded and installed:  $> vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier $> git clone https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch02-example-vagrant.git $> cd tdd-java-ch02-example-vagrant $> vagrant up  [ 21 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  When this command is run, you should see the following output:  Be patient until the execution is finished. Once done, you'll have a new virtual machine with Ubuntu, Docker, and one MongoDB instance up and running. The best part is that all this was accomplished with a single command.  [ 22 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  To see the status of the currently running VM, we can use the status argument:  $> vagrant status Current machine states: default                   running  virtualbox   The virtual machine can be accessed either through ssh or by using Vagrant commands, as in the following example:  $> vagrant ssh Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS  GNU Linux 3.13.0-46-generic x86_64   * Documentation:  https:  help.ubuntu.com   System information disabled due to load higher than 1.0  Get cloud support with Ubuntu Advantage Cloud Guest:   http:  www.ubuntu.com business services cloud  0 packages can be updated.  0 updates are security updates. vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$  Finally, to stop the virtual machine, exit from it and run the vagrant halt command:  $> exit $> vagrant halt   ==> default: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM... $>  For the list of Vagrant boxes or further details about configuring Vagrant, visit: https:  www.vagrantup.com.  Docker Once the environment is set, it is time to install the services and the software that we need. This can be done using Docker, a simple and portable way to ship and run many applications and services in isolated containers. We will use it to install the required databases, web servers, and all the other applications required throughout this book, in a virtual machine created using Vagrant. In fact, the Vagrant VM that was previously created already has an example of getting an instance of MongoDB up and running using Docker.  [ 23 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  Let's bring up the VM again  we stopped it previously with the vagrant halt command  and also MongoDB:  $> vagrant up $> vagrant ssh vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ docker start mongoDB mongoDB vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ docker ps CONTAINER ID        IMAGE           COMMAND                    CREATED 360f5340d5fc        mongo:2         " entrypoint.sh mong..."   4 minutes ago STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES Up 4 minutes        0.0.0.0:27017->27017 tcp   mongoDB vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ exit  With docker start, we started the container; with docker ps, we listed all the running processes.  By using this kind of procedure, we are able to reproduce a full-stack environment in the blink of an eye. You may be wondering if this is as awesome as it sounds. The answer is yes, it is. Vagrant and Docker allow developers to focus on what they are supposed to do and forget about complex installations and tricky configurations. Furthermore, we made an extra effort to provide you with all the necessary steps and resources to reproduce and test all the code examples and demonstrations in this book.  Build tools With time, code tends to grow both in complexity and size. This occurs in the software industry by its nature. All products evolve constantly and new requirements are made and implemented across a product's life. Build tools offer a way to make managing the project life cycle as straightforward as possible, by following a few code conventions, such as the organization of your code, in a specific way, and by the usage of naming a convention for your classes or a determined project structure formed by different folders and files.  Some of you might be familiar with Maven or Ant. They are a great couple of Swiss army knives for handling projects, but we are here to learn so we decided to use Gradle. Some of the advantages of Gradle are its reduced boilerplate code, resulting in a much shorter file and a more readable configuration file. Among others, Google uses it as its build tool. It is supported by IntelliJ IDEA and is quite easy to learn and work with. Most of the functionalities and tasks are obtained by adding plugins.  [ 24 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  Mastering Gradle is not the goal of this book. So, if you want to learn more about this awesome tool, take a tour through its website  http:  gradle.org   and read about the plugins you can use and the options you can customize. For a comparison of different Java build tools, visit: https:  technologyconversations.com 2014 06 18 build-tools . Before proceeding forward, make sure that Gradle is installed on your system.  Let's analyze the relevant parts of a build.gradle file. It holds project information in a concise way, using Groovy as the descriptor language. This is our project's build file, autogenerated with IntelliJ:  A Java plugin is applied since it is a Java project. It brings common Java tasks, such as build, package, test, and so on. The source compatibility is set to JDK 7. The compiler will complain if we try to use the Java syntax that is not supported by this version:  apply plugin: 'java' sourceCompatibility = 1.7 version = '1.0'  repositories {     mavenCentral   }  Maven Central  http:  search.maven.org   holds all our project dependencies. This section tells Gradle where to pull them from. The Maven Central repository is enough for this project, but you can add your custom repositories, if any. Nexus and Ivy are also supported:  dependencies {     testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12' }  Last, but not least, this is how project dependencies are declared. IntelliJ decided to use JUnit as the testing framework.  Gradle tasks are easy to run. For example, to run tests from the command prompt, we can simply execute the following:  gradle test  [ 25 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  This can be accomplished from IDEA by running the test task from the Gradle Tool Window that can be accessed from ViewTool WindowsGradle.  The tests result is stored in the HTML files that are located in the build reports tests directory.  The following is the test report generated by running gradle test against the sample code:  The integrated development environment As many tools and technologies will be covered, we recommend using IntelliJ IDEA as the tool for code development. The main reason is that this integrated development environment  IDE  works without any tedious configuration. The Community Edition  IntelliJ IDEA CE  comes with a bunch of built-in features and plugins that make coding easy and efficient. It automatically recommends plugins that can be installed depending on the file extension. As IntelliJ IDEA is the choice we made for this book, you will find references and steps referring to its actions or menus. Readers should find a proper way to emulate those steps if they are using other IDEs. Refer to: https:  www.jetbrains.com idea  for instructions on how to download and install IntelliJ IDEA.  [ 26 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  The IDEA demo project Let's create the base layout of the demo project. This project will be used throughout this chapter to illustrate all the topics that are covered. Java will be the programming language and Gradle  http:  gradle.org   will be used to run different sets of tasks, such as building, testing, and so on.  Let us import into IDEA the repository that contains examples from this chapter:  1. 2.  Open IntelliJ IDEA, select Check out from Version Control, and click on Git. Type https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch02-example-junit. git in the Git repository URL and click on Clone. Confirm for the rest of the IDEA questions until a new project is created with code cloned from the Git repository.   The imported project should look similar to the following image:  Now that we have got the project set up, it's time to take a look at unit-testing frameworks.  [ 27 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  Unit-testing frameworks In this section, two of the most used Java frameworks for unit testing are shown and briefly commented on. We will focus on their syntax and main features by comparing a test class written using both JUnit and TestNG. Although there are slight differences, both frameworks offer the most commonly used functionalities, and the main difference is how tests are executed and organized.  Let's start with a question. What is a test? How can we define it?  A test is a repeatable process or method that verifies the correct behavior of a tested target in a determined situation with a determined input expecting a predefined output or interactions.  In the programming approach, there are several types of tests depending on their scope—functional tests, acceptance tests, and unit tests. Further on, we will explore each of those types of tests in more detail.  Unit testing is about testing small pieces of code. Let's see how to test a single Java class. The class is quite simple, but enough for our interest:  public class Friendships {   private final Map > friendships =      new HashMap   ;    public void makeFriends String person1, String person2  {     addFriend person1, person2 ;     addFriend person2, person1 ;   }    public List  getFriendsList String person  {     if  !friendships.containsKey person   {       return Collections.emptyList  ;     }     return friendships.get person    }    public boolean areFriends String person1, String person2  {     return friendships.containsKey person1  &&         friendships.get person1 .contains person2 ;   }    private void addFriend String person, String friend  {     if  !friendships.containsKey person   {  [ 28 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2        friendships.put person, new ArrayList    ;     }     List  friends = friendships.get person ;     if  !friends.contains friend   {       friends.add friend ;     }   } }  JUnit JUnit  http:  junit.org   is a simple and easy-to-learn framework for writing and running tests. Each test is mapped as a method, and each method should represent a specific known scenario in which a part of our code will be executed. The code verification is made by comparing the expected output or behavior with the actual output.  The following is the test class written with JUnit. There are some scenarios missing, but for now we are interested in showing what tests look like. We will focus on better ways to test our code and on best practices later in this book.  Test classes usually consist of three stages: set up, test, and tear down. Let's start with methods that set up data needed for tests. A setup can be performed on a class or method level:  Friendships friendships;  @BeforeClass public static void beforeClass   {      This method will be executed once on initialization time }  @Before public void before   {   friendships = new Friendships  ;   friendships.makeFriends "Joe",",," "Audrey" ;   friendships.makeFriends "Joe", "Peter" ;   friendships.makeFriends "Joe", "Michael" ;   friendships.makeFriends "Joe", "Britney" ;   friendships.makeFriends "Joe", "Paul" ; }  The @BeforeClass annotation specifies a method that will be run once before any of the test methods in the class. It is a useful way to do some general set up that will be used by most  if not all  tests.  [ 29 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  The @Before annotation specifies a method that will be run before each test method. We can use it to set up test data without worrying that the tests that are run afterwards will change the state of that data. In the preceding example, we're instantiating the Friendships class and adding five sample entries to the Friendships list. No matter what changes will be performed by each individual test, this data will be recreated over and over until all the tests are performed.  Common examples of usage of those two annotations are the setting up of database data, the creation of files needed for tests, and so on. Later on, we'll see how external dependencies can and should be avoided using mocks. Nevertheless, functional or integration tests might still need those dependencies and the @Before and @BeforeClass annotations are a good way to set them up.  Once the data is set up, we can proceed with the actual tests:  @Test public void alexDoesNotHaveFriends   {   Assert.assertTrue "Alex does not have friends",      friendships.getFriendsList "Alex" .isEmpty   ; }  @Test public void joeHas5Friends   {   Assert.assertEquals "Joe has 5 friends", 5,      friendships.getFriendsList "Joe" .size   ; }  @Test public void joeIsFriendWithEveryone   {   List  friendsOfJoe =     Arrays.asList "Audrey", "Peter", "Michael", "Britney", "Paul" ;   Assert.assertTrue friendships.getFriendsList "Joe"       .containsAll friendsOfJoe  ; }  In this example, we are using a few of the many different types of asserts. We're confirming that Alex does not have any friends, while Joe is a very popular guy with five friends  Audrey, Peter, Michael, Britney, and Paul .  Finally, once the tests are finished, we might need to perform some cleanup:  @AfterClass public static void afterClass   {      This method will be executed once when all test are executed }  [ 30 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  @After public void after   {      This method will be executed once after each test execution }  In our example, in the Friendships class, we have no need to clean up anything. If there were such a need, those two annotations would provide that feature. They work in a similar fashion to the @Before and @BeforeClass annotations. @AfterClass is run once all tests are finished. The @After annotation is executed after each test. This runs each test method as a separate class instance. As long as we are avoiding global variables and external resources, such as databases and APIs, each test is isolated from the others. Whatever was done in one, does not affect the rest.  The complete source code can be found in the FriendshipsTest class at https: ​  bitbucket.​org ​vfarcic ​tdd-​java-​ch02-​example-​junit.  TestNG In TestNG  http:  testng.org doc index.html , tests are organized in classes, just as in the case of JUnit.  The following Gradle configuration  build.gradle  is required in order to run TestNG tests:  dependencies {    testCompile group: 'org.testng', name: 'testng', version: '6.8.21' }  test.useTestNG   {    Optionally you can filter which tests are executed using       exclude include filters    excludeGroups 'complex' }  Unlike JUnit, TestNG requires additional Gradle configuration that tells it to use TestNG to run tests.  [ 31 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  The following test class is written with TestNG and is a reflection of what we did earlier with JUnit. Repeated imports and other boring parts are omitted with the intention of focusing on the relevant parts:  @BeforeClass public static void beforeClass   {      This method will be executed once on initialization time }  @BeforeMethod public void before   {   friendships = new Friendships  ;   friendships.makeFriends "Joe", "Audrey" ;   friendships.makeFriends "Joe", "Peter" ;   friendships.makeFriends "Joe", "Michael" ;   friendships.makeFriends "Joe", "Britney" ;   friendships.makeFriends "Joe", "Paul" ; }  You probably already noticed the similarities between JUnit and TestNG. Both are using annotations to specify what the purposes of certain methods are. Besides different names  @Beforeclass versus @BeforeMethod , there is no difference between the two. However, unlike Junit, TestNG reuses the same test class instance for all test methods. This means that the test methods are not isolated by default, so more care is needed in the before and after methods.  Asserts are very similar as well:  public void alexDoesNotHaveFriends   {   Assert.assertTrue friendships.getFriendsList "Alex" .isEmpty  ,       "Alex does not have friends" ; }  public void joeHas5Friends   {   Assert.assertEquals friendships.getFriendsList "Joe" .size  ,       5, "Joe has 5 friends" ; }  public void joeIsFriendWithEveryone   {   List  friendsOfJoe =     Arrays.asList "Audrey", "Peter", "Michael", "Britney", "Paul" ;   Assert.assertTrue friendships.getFriendsList "Joe"        .containsAll friendsOfJoe  ; }  [ 32 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  The only notable difference when compared with JUnit is the order of the assert variables. While the JUnit assert's order of arguments is optional message, expected values, and actual values, TestNG's order is an actual value, expected value, and optional message. Besides the difference in the order of arguments we're passing to the assert methods, there are almost no differences between JUnit and TestNG.  You might have noticed that @Test is missing. TestNG allows us to set it on the class level and thus convert all public methods into tests.  The @After annotations are also very similar. The only notable difference is the TestNG @AfterMethod annotation that acts in the same way as the JUnit @After annotation.  As you can see, the syntax is pretty similar. Tests are organized in to classes and test verifications are made using assertions. That is not to say that there are no more important differences between those two frameworks; we'll see some of them throughout this book. I invite you to explore JUnit  http:  junit.org   and TestNG  http:  testng.org   by yourself.  The complete source code with the preceding examples can be found at https: ​  bitbucket.​org ​vfarcic ​tdd-​java-​ch02-​example-​testng.  The assertions we have written until now have used only the testing frameworks. However, there are some test utilities that can help us make them nicer and more readable.  Hamcrest and AssertJ In the previous section, we gave an overview of what a unit test is and how it can be written using two of the most commonly used Java frameworks. Since tests are an important part of our projects, why not improve the way we write them? Some cool projects emerged, aiming to empower the semantics of tests by changing the way that assertions are made. As a result, tests are more concise and easier to understand.  [ 33 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  Hamcrest Hamcrest adds a lot of methods called matchers. Each matcher is designed to perform a comparison operation. It is extensible enough to support custom matchers created by yourself. Furthermore, JUnit supports Hamcrest natively since its core is included in the JUnit distribution. You can start using Hamcrest effortlessly. However, we want to use the full-featured project so we will add a test dependency to Gradle's file:  testCompile 'org.hamcrest:hamcrest-all:1.3'  Let us compare one assert from JUnit with the equivalent one from Hamcrest:  The JUnit assert:  The Hamcrest assert:  List  friendsOfJoe =   Arrays.asList "Audrey", "Peter", "Michael", "Britney", "Paul" ; Assert.assertTrue  friendships.getFriendsList "Joe"      .containsAll friendsOfJoe  ;  assertThat    friendships.getFriendsList "Joe" ,   containsInAnyOrder "Audrey", "Peter", "Michael", "Britney", "Paul"   ;  As you can see, Hamcrest is a bit more expressive. It has a much bigger range of asserts that allows us to avoid some boilerplate code and, at the same time, makes code easier to read and is more expressive.  Here's another example:  JUnit assert:  Hamcrest assert:  Assert.assertEquals 5, friendships.getFriendsList "Joe" .size   ;  assertThat friendships.getFriendsList "Joe" , hasSize 5  ;  [ 34 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  You'll notice two differences. The first is that, unlike JUnit, Hamcrest works almost always with direct objects. While in the case of JUnit, we needed to get the integer size and compare it with the expected number  5 ; Hamcrest has a bigger range of asserts so we can simply use one of them  hasSize  together with the actual object  List . Another difference is that Hamcrest has the inverse order with the actual value being the first argument  like TestNG .  Those two examples are not enough to show the full potential offered by Hamcrest. Later on in this book, there will be more examples and explanations of Hamcrest. Visit http:  hamcrest.org  and explore its syntax.  The complete source code can be found in the FriendshipsHamcrestTest class in the https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch02-example-junit repositories.  AssertJ AssertJ works in a similar way to Hamcrest. A major difference is that AssertJ assertions can be concatenated.  To work with AssertJ, the dependency must be added to Gradle's dependencies:  testCompile 'org.assertj:assertj-core:2.0.0'  Let's compare JUnit asserts with AssertJ:  Assert.assertEquals 5, friendships.getFriendsList "Joe" .size   ; List  friendsOfJoe =    Arrays.asList "Audrey", "Peter", "Michael", "Britney", "Paul" ; Assert.assertTrue   friendships.getFriendsList "Joe"     .containsAll  friendsOfJoe   ;  The same two asserts can be concatenated to a single one in AssertJ:  assertThat friendships.getFriendsList "Joe"     .hasSize 5    .containsOnly "Audrey", "Peter", "Michael", "Britney", "Paul" ;  This was a nice improvement. There was no need to have two separate asserts, nor was there a need to create a new list with expected values. Moreover, AssertJ is more readable and easier to understand.  [ 35 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  The complete source code can be found in the FriendshipsAssertJTest class at https:   ​bitbucket.​org ​vfarcic ​tdd-​java-​ch02-​example-​junit.  Now that we have the tests up and running, we might want to see what the code coverage is that is generated by our tests.  Code coverage tools The fact that we wrote tests does not mean that they are good, nor that they cover enough code. As soon as we start writing and running tests, the natural reaction is to start asking questions that were not available before. What parts of our code are properly tested? What are the cases that our tests did not take into account? Are we testing enough? These and other similar questions can be answered with code coverage tools. They can be used to identify the blocks or lines of code that were not covered by our tests; they can also calculate the percentage of code covered and provide other interesting metrics.  They are powerful tools used to obtain metrics and show relations between tests and implementation code. However, as with any other tool, their purpose needs to be clear. They do not provide information about quality, but only about which parts of our code have been tested.  Code coverage shows whether the code lines are reached during test execution, but it is not a guarantee of good testing practices because test quality is not included in these metrics.  Let's take a look at one of the most popular tools used to calculate code coverage.  JaCoCo Java Code Coverage  JaCoCo  is a well-known tool for measuring test coverage. To use it in our project, we need to add a few lines to our Gradle configuration file, that is, build.gradle:  1.  Add the Gradle plugin for JaCoCo:  apply plugin: 'jacoco'  [ 36 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  2.  To see the JaCoCo results, run the following from your command prompt:  gradle test jacocoTestReport  3. 4.  The same Gradle tasks can be run from the Gradle Tasks IDEA Tool Window. The end result is stored in the build reports jacoco test html directory. It's an HTML file that can be opened in any browser:  Further chapters of this book will explore code coverage in more detail. Until then, go to http:  www.eclemma.org jacoco  for more information.  Mocking frameworks Our project looks cool, but it's too simple and it is far from being a real project. It still doesn't use external resources. A database is required by Java projects so we'll try to introduce it, as well.  What is the common way to test code that uses external resources or third-party libraries? Mocks are the answer. A mock object, or simply a mock, is a simulated object that can be used to replace real ones. They are very useful when objects that depend on external resources are deprived of them.  In fact, you don't need a database at all while you are developing the application. Instead, you can use mocks to speed up development and testing and use a real database connection only at runtime. Instead of spending time setting up a database and preparing test data, we can focus on writing classes and think about them later on during integration time.  [ 37 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  For demonstration purposes, we'll introduce two new classes: the Person class and the FriendCollection class that are designed to represent persons and database object mapping. Persistence will be done with MongoDB  https:  www.mongodb.org  .  Our sample will have two classes. Person will represent database object data; FriendCollection will be our data access layer. The code is, hopefully, self-explanatory.  Let's create and use the Person class:  public class Person {   @Id   private String name;    private List  friends;    public Person   { }    public Person String name  {     this.name = name;     friends = new ArrayList   ;   }    public List  getFriends   {     return friends;   }    public void addFriend String friend  {     if  !friends.contains friend   friends.add friend ;   } }  Let's create and use the FriendsCollection class:  public class FriendsCollection {   private MongoCollection friends;    public FriendsCollection   {     try {       DB db = new MongoClient  .getDB "friendships" ;       friends = new Jongo db .getCollection "friends" ;     } catch  UnknownHostException e  {       throw new RuntimeException e.getMessage   ;     }   }    public Person findByName String name  {     return friends.findOne "{_id: }", name .as Person.class ;  [ 38 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2    }    public void save Person p  {     friends.save p ;   } }  In addition, some new dependencies have been introduced so the Gradle dependencies block needs to be modified, as well. The first one is the MongoDB driver, which is required to connect to the database. The second is Jongo, a small project that makes accessing Mongo collections pretty straightforward.  The Gradle dependencies for mongodb and jongo are as follows:  dependencies {     compile 'org.mongodb:mongo-java-driver:2.13.2'     compile 'org.jongo:jongo:1.1' }  We are using a database so the Friendships class should also be modified. We should change a map to FriendsCollection and modify the rest of the code to use it. The end result is the following:  public class FriendshipsMongo {   private FriendsCollection friends;    public FriendshipsMongo   {     friends = new FriendsCollection  ;   }    public List  getFriendsList String person  {     Person p = friends.findByName person ;     if  p == null  return Collections.emptyList  ;     return p.getFriends  ;   }    public void makeFriends String person1, String person2  {     addFriend person1, person2 ;     addFriend person2, person1 ;   }    public boolean areFriends String person1, String person2  {     Person p = friends.findByName person1 ;     return p != null && p.getFriends  .contains person2 ;   }    private void addFriend String person, String friend  {  [ 39 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2      Person p = friends.findByName person ;     if  p == null  p = new Person person ;     p.addFriend friend ;     friends.save p ;   } }  The complete source code can be found in the FriendsCollection and FriendshipsMongo classes in the https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch02-example-junit repository.  Now that we have our Friendships class working with MongoDB, let's take a look at one possible way to test it by using mocks.  Mockito Mockito is a Java framework that allows easy creation of the test double.  The Gradle dependency is the following:  dependencies {   testCompile group: 'org.mockito', name: 'mockito-all', version: '1.+' }  Mockito runs through the JUnit runner. It creates all the required mocks for us and injects them into the class with tests. There are two basic approaches; instantiating mocks by ourselves and injecting them as class dependencies via a class constructor or using a set of annotations. In the next example, we are going to see how it is done using annotations.  In order for a class to use Mockito annotations, it needs to be run with MockitoJUnitRunner. Using the runner simplifies the process because you just simply add annotations to objects to be created:  In your test class, the tested class should be annotated with @InjectMocks. This tells Mockito which class to inject mocks into:  @RunWith MockitoJUnitRunner.class  public class FriendshipsTest { ... }  @InjectMocks FriendshipsMongo friendships;  [ 40 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  From then on, we can specify which specific methods or objects inside the class, in this case FriendshipsMongo, will be substituted with mocks:  @Mock FriendsCollection friends;  In this example, FriendsCollection inside the FriendshipsMongo class will be mocked.  Now, we can specify what should be returned when friends is invoked:  Person joe = new Person "Joe" ; doReturn joe .when friends .findByName "Joe" ; assertThat friends.findByName "Joe"  .isEqualTo joe ;  In this example, we're telling Mockito to return the joe object whenever friends.findByName "Joe"  is invoked. Later on, we're verifying with assertThat that this assumption is correct.  Let's try to do the same test as we did previously in the class that was without MongoDB:  @Test public void joeHas5Friends   {   List  expected =     Arrays.asList "Audrey", "Peter", "Michael", "Britney", "Paul" ;   Person joe = spy new Person "Joe"  ;    doReturn joe .when friends .findByName "Joe" ;   doReturn expected .when joe .getFriends  ;    assertThat friendships.getFriendsList "Joe"       .hasSize 5      .containsOnly "Audrey", "Peter", "Michael", "Britney", "Paul" ; }  A lot of things happened in this small test. First, we're specifying that joe is a spy. In Mockito, spies are real objects that use real methods unless specified otherwise. Then, we're telling Mockito to return joe when the friends method calls getFriends. This combination allows us to return the expected list when the getFriends method is invoked. Finally, we're asserting that the getFriendsList returns the expected list of names.  The complete source code can be found in the FriendshipsMongoAssertJTest class in the https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch02-example-junit repository.  [ 41 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  We'll use Mockito later on; throughout this book, you'll get your chance to become more familiar with it and with mocking in general. More information about Mockito can be found at http:  mockito.org .  EasyMock EasyMock is an alternative mocking framework. It is very similar to Mockito. However, the main difference is that EasyMock does not create spy objects but mocks. Other differences are syntactical.  Let's see an example of EasyMock. We'll use the same set of test cases as those that were used for the Mockito examples:  @RunWith EasyMockRunner.class  public class FriendshipsTest {   @TestSubject   FriendshipsMongo friendships = new FriendshipsMongo  ;   @Mock type = MockType.NICE    FriendsCollection friends; }  Essentially, the runner does the same as the Mockito runner:  @TestSubject FriendshipsMongo friendships = new FriendshipsMongo  ;  @Mock type = MockType.NICE  FriendsCollection friends;  The @TestSubject annotation is similar to Mockito's @InjectMocks, while the @Mock annotation denotes an object to be mocked in a similar fashion to Mockito's @Mock. Furthermore, the type NICE tells the mock to return empty.  Let's compare one of the asserts we did with Mockito:  @Test public void mockingWorksAsExpected   {   Person joe = new Person "Joe" ;   expect friends.findByName "Joe"  .andReturn joe ;   replay friends ;   assertThat friends.findByName "Joe"  .isEqualTo joe ; }  [ 42 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  Besides small differences in syntax, the only disadvantage of EasyMock is that the additional instruction replay was needed. It tells the framework that the previously specified expectation should be applied. The rest is almost the same. We're specifying that friends.findByName should return the joe object, applying that expectation and, finally, asserting whether the actual result is as expected.  In the EasyMock version, the second test method that we used with Mockito is the following:  @Test public void joeHas5Friends   {   List  expected =   Arrays.asList "Audrey", "Peter", "Michael", "Britney", "Paul" ;   Person joe = createMock Person.class ;    expect friends.findByName "Joe"  .andReturn joe ;   expect joe.getFriends   .andReturn expected ;   replay friends ;   replay joe ;    assertThat friendships.getFriendsList "Joe"       .hasSize 5      .containsOnly "Audrey", "Peter", "Michael", "Britney", "Paul" ; }  Again, there are almost no differences when compared to Mockito, except that EasyMock does not have spies. Depending on the context, that might be an important difference.  Even though both frameworks are similar, there are small details that make us choose Mockito as a framework, which will be used throughout this book.  Visit http:  easymock.org  for more information about this asserts library.  The complete source code can be found in the FriendshipsMongoEasyMockTest class in the https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch02-example-junit repository.  [ 43 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  Extra power for mocks Both projects introduced earlier do not cover all types of methods or fields. Depending on the applied modifiers, such as static or final, a class, method, or field, can be out of range for Mockito or EasyMock. In such cases, we can use PowerMock to extend the mocking framework. This way, we can mock objects that can only be mocked in a tricky manner. However, one should be cautious with PowerMock since the necessity to use many of the features it provides is usually a sign of poor design. If you're working on a legacy code, PowerMock might be a good choice. Otherwise, try to design your code in such a way that PowerMock is not needed. We'll show you how to do that later on.  For more information, visit https:  code.google.com p powermock .  User interface testing Even though unit testing can and should cover the major part of the application, there is still a need to work on functional and acceptance tests. Unlike unit tests, they provide higher-level verifications, and are usually performed at entry points, and rely heavily on user interfaces. At the end, we are creating applications that are, in most cases, used by humans, so being confident of our application's behavior is very important. This comfort status can be achieved by testing what the application is expected to do, from the point of view of real users.  Here, we'll try to provide an overview of functional and acceptance testing through a user interface. We'll use the web as an example, even though there are many other types of user interfaces, such as desktop applications, smartphone interfaces, and so on.  Web-testing frameworks The application classes and data sources have been tested throughout this chapter, but there is still something missing; the most common user entry point—the web. Most enterprise applications such as intranets or corporate sites are accessed using a browser. For this reason, testing the web provides significant value, helping us to make sure that it is doing what it is expected to do.  Furthermore, companies are investing a lot of time performing long and heavy manual tests every time the application changes. This is a big waste of time since a lot of those tests can be automatized and executed without supervision, using tools such as Selenium or Selenide.  [ 44 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  Selenium Selenium is a great tool for web testing. It uses a browser to run verifications and it can handle all the popular browsers, such as Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. It also supports headless browsers to test web pages with much greater speed and less resources consumption.  There is a SeleniumIDE plugin that can be used to create tests by recording actions performed by the user. Currently, it is only supported by Firefox. Sadly, even though tests generated this way provide very fast results, they tend to be very brittle and cause problems in the long run, especially when some part of a page changes. For this reason, we'll stick with the code written without the help from that plugin.  The simplest way to execute Selenium is to run it through JUnitRunner. All Selenium tests start by initializing WebDriver, the class used for communication with browsers:  1.  Let's start by adding the Gradle dependency:  dependencies {   testCompile 'org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java:2.45.0' }  2.  As an example, we'll create a test that searches Wikipedia. We'll use a Firefox driver as our browser of choice:  WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver  ;  WebDriver is an interface that can be instantiated with one of the many drivers provided by Selenium:  1.  To open a URL, the instruction would be the following:  driver.get "http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Main_Page" ;  2.  Once the page is opened, we can search for an input element by its name and then type some text:  WebElement query = driver.findElement By.name "search"  ; query.sendKeys "Test-driven development" ;  3.  Once we type our search query, we should find and click the Go button:  WebElement goButton = driver.findElement By.name "go"  ; goButton.click  ;  [ 45 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  4.  Once we reach our destination, it is time to validate that, in this case, the page title is correct:  assertThat driver.getTitle  ,   startsWith "Test-driven development"  ;  5.  Finally, the driver should be closed once we're finished using it:  driver.quit  ;  That's it. We have a small but valuable test that verifies a single use case. While there is much more to be said about Selenium, hopefully, this has provided you with enough information to realize the potential behind it.  Visit http:  www.seleniumhq.org  for further information and more complex uses of WebDriver.  The complete source code can be found in the SeleniumTest class in the https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch02-example-web repository.  While Selenium is the most commonly used framework to work with browsers, it is still very low-level and requires a lot of tweaking. Selenide was born out of the idea that Selenium would be much more useful if there was a higher-level library that could implement some of the common patterns and solve often-repeated needs.  Selenide What we have seen about Selenium is very cool. It brings the opportunity to probe that our application is doing things well, but sometimes it is a bit tricky to configure and use. Selenide is a project based on Selenium that offers a good syntax for writing tests and makes them more readable. It hides the usage of WebDriver and configurations from you, while still maintaining a high-level of customization:  1.  Like all the other libraries we have used until now, the first step is to add the Gradle dependency:  dependencies {     testCompile 'com.codeborne:selenide:2.17' }  [ 46 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  2.  Let's see how we can write the previous Selenium test using Selenide instead. The syntax might be familiar to for those who know JQuery  https:  jquery.com  :  public class SelenideTest {   @Test   public void wikipediaSearchFeature   throws       InterruptedException {        Opening Wikipedia page     open "http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Main_Page" ;         Searching TDD     $ By.name "search"  .setValue "Test-driven development" ;         Clicking search button     $ By.name "go"  .click  ;         Checks     assertThat title  ,       startsWith "Test-driven development"  ;   } }  This was a more expressive way to write a test. On top of a more fluent syntax, there are some things that happen behind this code and would require additional lines of Selenium. For example, a click action will wait until an element in question is available, and will fail only if the predefined period of time has expired. Selenium, on the other hand, would fail immediately. In today's world, with many elements being loaded dynamically through JavaScript, we cannot expect everything to appear at once. Hence, this Selenide feature proves to be useful and saves us from using repetitive boilerplate code. There are many other benefits Selenide brings to the table. Due to the benefits that Selenide provides when compared with Selenium, it will be our framework of choice throughout this book. Furthermore, there is a whole chapter dedicated to web testing using this framework. Visit http:  selenide.org  for more information on ways to use web drivers in your tests.  No matter whether tests were written with one framework or another, the effect is the same. When tests are run, a Firefox browser window will emerge and execute all steps defined in the test sequentially. Unless a headless browser was chosen as your driver of choice, you will be able to see what is going on throughout the test. If something goes wrong, a failure trace is available. On top of that, we can take browser screenshots at any point. For example, it is a common practice to record the situation at the time of a failure.

Armed with a basic knowledge of web-testing frameworks, it is time to take a short look at BDD.  Behavior-driven development Behavior-driven development  BDD  is an agile process designed to keep the focus on stakeholder value throughout the whole project. The premise of BDD is that the requirement has to be written in a way that everyone, be it the business representative, analyst, developer, tester, manager, and so on, understands it. The key is to have a unique set of artifacts that are understood and used by everyone—a collection of user stories. Stories are written by the whole team and used as both requirements and executable test cases. It is a way to perform TDD with a clarity that cannot be accomplished with unit testing. It is a way to describe and test functionality in  almost  natural language and make it runnable and repeatable.  A story is composed of scenarios. Each scenario represents a concise behavioral use case and is written in natural language using steps. Steps are a sequence of the preconditions, events, and outcomes of a scenario. Each step must start with the words Given, When, or Then. Given is for preconditions, When is for actions, and Then is for performing validations.  This was only a brief introduction. There is a whole chapter, Chapter 8, BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team, dedicated to this topic. Now it is time to introduce JBehave and Cucumber as two of the many available frameworks for writing and executing stories.  JBehave JBehave is a Java BDD framework used for writing acceptance tests that are able to be executed and automated. The steps used in stories are bound to Java code through several annotations provided by the framework:  1.  First of all, add JBehave to Gradle dependencies:  dependencies {     testCompile 'org.jbehave:jbehave-core:3.9.5' }  [ 48 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  2.  Let's go through a few example steps:  @Given "I go to Wikipedia homepage"  public void goToWikiPage   {   open "http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Main_Page" ; }  3.  This is the Given type of step. It represents a precondition that needs to be fulfilled for some actions to be performed successfully. In this particular case, it will open a Wikipedia page. Now that we have our precondition specified, it is time to define some actions:  @When "I enter the value $value on a field named $fieldName"  public void enterValueOnFieldByName String value, String fieldName  {   $ By.name fieldName  .setValue value ; } @When "I click the button $buttonName"  public void clickButonByName String buttonName {   $ By.name buttonName  .click  ; }  4.  As you can see, actions are defined with the When annotation. In our case, we can use those steps to set some value to a field or click on a specific button. Once actions are performed, we can deal with validations. Note that steps can be more flexible by introducing parameters:  @Then "the page title contains $title"  public void pageTitleIs String title  {   assertThat title  , containsString title  ; }  Validations are declared using the Then annotation. In this example, we are validating the page title as expected.  These steps can be found in the WebSteps class in the https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch02-example-web repository.  Once we have defined our steps, it is time to use them. The following story combines those steps in order to validate a desired behavior:  Scenario: TDD search on wikipedia  [ 49 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  It starts with naming the scenario. The name should be as concise as possible, but enough to identify the user case unequivocally; it is for informative purposes only:  Given I go to Wikipedia homepage When I enter the value Test-driven development on a field named search When I click the button go Then the page title contains Test-driven development  As you can see, we are using the same steps text that we defined earlier. The code related to those steps will be executed in a sequential order. If any of them are halted, the execution is halted and the scenario itself is considered failed.  Even though we defined our steps ahead of stories, it can be done the other way around with a story being defined first and the steps following. In that case, the status of a scenario would be pending, meaning that the required steps are missing.

Cucumber Cucumber was originally a Ruby BDD framework. These days it supports several languages including Java. It provides functionality that is very similar to JBehave.  Let's see the same examples written in Cucumber.  The same as any other dependency we have used until now, Cucumber needs to be added to build.gradle before we can start using it:  dependencies {     testCompile 'info.cukes:cucumber-java:1.2.2'     testCompile 'info.cukes:cucumber-junit:1.2.2' }  We will create the same steps as we did with JBehave, using the Cucumber way:  @Given "^I go to Wikipedia homepage$"  public void goToWikiPage   {   open "http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Main_Page" ; }  @When "^I enter the value  .*  on a field named  .* $"  public void enterValueOnFieldByName String value,     String fieldName  {   $ By.name fieldName  .setValue value ; }  @When "^I click the button  .* $"  public void clickButonByName String buttonName  {   $ By.name buttonName  .click  ; }  @Then "^the page title contains  .* $"  public void pageTitleIs String title  {   assertThat title  , containsString title  ; }  [ 51 ]   Tools, Frameworks, and Environments  Chapter 2  The only noticeable difference between these two frameworks is the way Cucumber defines steps text. It uses regular expressions to match variables types, unlike JBehave which deduces them from a method signature.  The steps code can be found in the WebSteps class in the https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch02-example-web repository:  Let's see how the story looks when written using the Cucumber syntax:  Feature: Wikipedia Search    Scenario: TDD search on wikipedia     Given I go to Wikipedia homepage     When I enter the value Test-driven development on a field named search     When I click the button go     Then the page title contains Test-driven development  Note that there are almost no differences.

Since both JBehave and Cucumber offer a similar set of features, we decided to use JBehave throughout the rest of this book. There is a whole chapter dedicated to BDD and JBehave.  Summary In this chapter, we took a break from TDD and introduced many tools and frameworks that will be used for code demonstrations in the rest of the chapters. We set up everything from version control, virtual machines, building tools, and IDEs, until we reached frameworks that are commonly used as today's testing tools.  We are big proponents of the open source movement. Following this spirit, we made a special effort to select free tools and frameworks in every category.  Now that we have set up all the tools that we will need, in the next chapter, we will go deeper into TDD, starting with the Red-Green-Refactor procedure-TDD's cornerstone.  [ 53 ]   3  – Bruce Lee  Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  "Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do."  The Red-Green-Refactor technique is the basis of test-driven development  TDD . It is a game of ping pong in which we are switching between tests and implementation code at great speed. We'll fail, then we'll succeed, and, finally, we'll improve.  We'll develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game by going through each requirement one at a time. We'll write a test and see if it fails. Then, we'll write code that implements that test, run all the tests, and see them succeed. Finally, we'll refactor the code and try to make it better. This process will be repeated many times until all the requirements are successfully implemented.  We'll start by setting up the environment with Gradle and JUnit. Then, we'll go a bit deeper into the Red-Green-Refactor process. Once we're ready with the setup and theory, we'll go through the high-level requirements of the application.   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  With everything set, we'll dive right into the code—one requirement at a time. Once everything is done, we'll take a look at the code coverage and decide whether it is acceptable or whether more tests need to be added.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  Setting up the environment with Gradle and JUnit The Red-Green-Refactor process Tic-Tac-Toe's requirements Developing Tic-Tac-Toe Code coverage More exercises  Setting up the environment with Gradle and JUnit You are probably familiar with the setup of Java projects. However, you might not have worked with IntelliJ IDEA before or you might have used Maven instead of Gradle. In order to make sure that you can follow the exercise, we'll quickly go through the setup.  Setting up Gradle Java project in IntelliJ IDEA The main purpose of this book is to teach TDD, so we will not go into detail about Gradle  and IntelliJ IDEA. Both are used as an example. All exercises in this book can be done with different choices for IDE and build tools. You can, for example, use Maven and Eclipse instead. For most, it might be easier to follow the same guidelines as those presented throughout the book, but the choice is yours.  The following steps will create a new Gradle project in IntelliJ IDEA:  1.  2.  Open IntelliJ IDEA. Click on Create New Project and select Gradle from the left- hand side menu. Then, click on Next. If you are using IDEA 14 and higher, you will be asked for an Artifact ID. Type tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac-toe and click on Next twice. Type tdd-java-ch03- tic-tac-toe as the project name. Then, click on the Finish button:  [ 55 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  In the New Project dialog, we can observe that IDEA has already created the build.gradle file. Open it and you'll see that it already contains the JUnit dependency. Since this is our framework of choice in this chapter, there is no additional configuration that we should do. By default, build.gradle is set to use Java 1.5 as a source compatibility setting. You can change it to any version you prefer. The examples in this chapter will not use any of the Java features that came after Version 5, but that doesn't mean that you cannot solve the exercise using, for example, JDK 8.  Our build.gradle file should look like the following:  apply plugin: 'java'  version = '1.0'  repositories {   mavenCentral    [ 56 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  }  dependencies {   testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.11' }  Now, all that's left to do is to create packages that we'll use for tests and the implementation. From the Project dialog, right-click to bring up the Context menu and select NewDirectory. Type src test java com packtpublishing tddjava ch03tictactoe and click on the OK button to create the tests package. Repeat the same steps with the src main java com packtpublishing tddjava ch03tictactoe directory to create the implementation package.  Finally, we need to the make test and implementation classes. Create the TicTacToeSpec class inside the com.packtpublishing.tddjava.ch03tictactoe package in the src test java directory. This class will contain all our tests. Repeat the same for the TicTacToe class in the src main java directory.  Your Project structure should be similar to the one presented in the following screenshot:  [ 57 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  The source code can be found in the 00-setup branch of the tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac- toe Git repository at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac-toe branch 00-setup.  Always separate tests from the implementation code.  The benefits are as follows: this avoids accidentally packaging tests together with production binaries; many build tools expect tests to be in a certain source directory.  A common practice is to have at least two source directories. The implementation code should be located in src main java and the test code in src test java. In bigger projects, the number of source directories can increase, but the separation between implementation and tests should remain.  Build tools such as Maven and Gradle expect source directories, separation, as well as naming conventions.  That's it. We're set to start working on our Tic-Tac-Toe application using JUnit as the testing framework of choice and Gradle for compilation, dependencies, testing, and other tasks. In Chapter 1, Why Should I Care for Test-Driven Development?, you first encountered the Red- Green-Refactor procedure. Since it is the cornerstone of TDD and is the main objective of the exercise in this chapter, it might be a good idea to go into a bit more detail before we start the development.  The Red-Green-Refactor process The Red-Green-Refactor process is the most important part of TDD. It is the main pillar, without which no other aspect of TDD will work.  The name comes from the states our code is in within the cycle. When in the red state, code does not work; when in the green state, everything is working as expected, but not necessarily in the best possible way. Refactor is the phase when we know that features are well covered with tests and thus gives us the confidence to change it and make it better.  [ 58 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Writing a test Every new feature starts with a test. The main objective of this test is to focus on requirements and code design before writing the code. A test is a form of an executable documentation and can be used later on to get an understanding of what the code does or what are the intentions behind it.  At this point, we are in the red state since the execution of tests fails. There is a discrepancy between what tests expect from the code and what the implementation code actually does. To be more specific, there is no code that fulfills the expectation of the last test; we haven't written it yet. It is possible that at this stage all the tests are actually passing, but that's the sign of a problem.  Running all the tests and confirming that the last one is failing Confirming that the last test is failing, confirms that the test would not, mistakenly, pass without the introduction of a new code. If the test is passing, then the feature already exists or the test is producing a false positive. If that's the case and the test actually always passes independently of the implementation, it is, in itself, worthless and should be removed.  A test must not only fail, but must fail for the expected reason. In this phase, we are still in the red stage. Tests were run and the last one failed.  Writing the implementation code The purpose of this phase is to write code that will make the last test pass. Do not try to make it perfect, nor try to spend too much time with it. If it's not well-written or is not optimum, that is still okay. It'll become better later on. What we're really trying to do is to create a safety net in the form of tests that are confirmed to pass. Do not try to introduce any functionality that was not described in the last test. To do that, we are required to go back to the first step and start with a new test. However, we should not write new tests until all the existing ones are passing.  In this phase, we are still in the red stage. While the code that was written would probably pass all the tests, that assumption is not yet confirmed.  [ 59 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Running all the tests It is very important that all the tests are run and not only the last test that was written. The code that we just wrote might have made the last test pass while breaking something else. Running all the tests confirms not only that the implementation of the last test is correct, but also that it did not break the integrity of the application as a whole. This slow execution of the whole test suite is a sign of poorly written tests or having too much coupling in the code. Coupling prevents the easy isolation of external dependencies, thus increasing the time required for the execution of tests.  In this phase, we are in the green state. All the tests are passing and the application behaves as we expect it to behave.  Refactoring While all the previous steps are mandatory, this one is optional. Even though refactoring is rarely done at the end of each cycle, sooner or later it will be desired, if not mandatory. Not every implementation of a test requires refactoring. There is no rule that tells you when to refactor and when not to. The best time is as soon as one gets a feeling that the code can be rewritten in a better or more optimum way.  What constitutes a candidate for refactoring? This is a hard question to answer since it can have many answers—it's hard to understand code, the illogical location of a piece of code, duplication, names that do not clearly state a purpose, long methods, classes that do too many things, and so on. The list can go on and on. No matter what the reasons are, the most important rule is that refactoring cannot change any existing functionality.  Repeating Once all the steps  with refactor being optional  are finished, we repeat them. At first glance, the whole process might seem too long or too complicated, but it is not. Experienced TDD practitioners write one to ten lines of code before switching to the next step. The whole cycle should last anything between a couple of seconds and no more than a few minutes. If it takes more than that, the scope of a test is too big and should be split into smaller chunks. Be fast, fail fast, correct, and repeat.  With this knowledge in mind, let us go through the requirements of the application we're about to develop using the Red-Green-Refactor process.  [ 60 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Tic-Tac-Toe game requirements Tic-Tac-Toe is most often played by young children. The rules of the game are fairly simple.  Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, wins the game.  For more information about the game, please visit Wikipedia  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Tic-tac-toe .  More detailed requirements will be presented later on.  The exercise consists of the creation of a single test that corresponds to one of the requirements. The test is followed by the code that fulfills the expectations of that test. Finally, if needed, the code is refactored. The same procedure should be repeated with more tests related to the same requirement. Once we're satisfied with tests and the implementation of that requirement, we'll move to the next one until they're all done.  In real-world situations, you wouldn't get such detailed requirements, but dive right into tests that would act as both requirements and validation. However, until you get comfortable with TDD, we'll have to define requirements separately from tests.  Even though all the tests and the implementation are provided, try to read only one requirement at a time and write tests and implementation code yourself. Once done, compare your solution with the one from this book and move to the next requirement. There is no one and only one solution; yours might be better than the ones presented here.  Developing Tic-Tac-Toe Are you ready to code? Let's start with the first requirement.  [ 61 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Requirement 1 – placing pieces We should start by defining the boundaries and what constitutes an invalid placement of a piece.  A piece can be placed on any empty space of a 3×3 board.  We can split this requirement into three tests:  When a piece is placed anywhere outside the x-axis, then RuntimeException is thrown When a piece is placed anywhere outside the y-axis, then RuntimeException is thrown When a piece is placed on an occupied space, then RuntimeException is thrown  As you can see, the tests related to this first requirement are all about validations of the input argument. There is nothing in the requirements that says what should be done with those pieces.  Before we proceed with the first test, a brief explanation of how to test exceptions with JUnit is in order.  Starting from Release 4.7, JUnit introduced a feature called Rule. It can be used to do many different things  more information can be found at https:  github.com junit-team junit wiki Rules , but in our case we're interested in the ExpectedException rule:  public class FooTest {   @Rule   public ExpectedException exception = ExpectedException.none  ;   @Test   public void whenDoFooThenThrowRuntimeException   {     Foo foo = new Foo  ;     exception.expect RuntimeException.class ;     foo.doFoo  ;   } }  [ 62 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  In this example, we defined that the ExpectedException is a rule. Later on, in the doFooThrowsRuntimeException test, we're specifying that we are expecting the RuntimeException to be thrown after the Foo class is instantiated. If it is thrown before, the test will fail. If the exception is thrown after, the test is successful.  @Before can be used to annotate a method that should be run before each test. It is a very useful feature with which we can, for example, instantiate a class used in tests or perform some other types of actions that should be run before each test:  private Foo foo;  @Before public final void before   {   foo = new Foo  ; }  In this example, the Foo class will be instantiated before each test. This way, we can avoid having repetitive code that would instantiate Foo inside each test method.  Each test should be annotated with @Test. This tells JunitRunner which methods constitute tests. Each of them will be run in a random order so make sure that each test is self-sufficient and does not depend on the state that might be created by other tests:  @Test public void whenSomethingThenResultIsSomethingElse   {      This is a test method }  With this knowledge, you should be able to write your first test and follow it with the implementation. Once done, compare it with the solution provided.  [ 63 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Use descriptive names for test methods.   One of the benefits is that it helps to understand the objective of tests.  Using method names that describe tests is beneficial when trying to figure out why some tests failed or when the coverage should be increased with more tests. It should be clear what conditions are set before the test, what actions are performed, and what the expected outcome is.  There are many different ways to name test methods. My preferred method is to name them using the given when then syntax used in BDD scenarios. Given describes  pre conditions, When describes actions, and Then describes the expected outcome. If a test does not have preconditions  usually set using the @Before and @BeforeClass annotations , Given can be skipped.  Do not rely only on comments to provide information about test objectives. Comments do not appear when tests are executed from your favorite IDE, nor do they appear in reports generated by the CI or build tools.  Besides writing tests, you'll need to run them as well. Since we are using Gradle, they can be run from the command prompt:      $ gradle test  IntelliJ IDEA provides a very good Gradle tasks model that can be reached by clicking on ViewTool WindowsGradle. It lists all the tasks that can be run with Gradle  test being one of them . The choice is yours—you can run tests in any way you see fit, as long as you run all of them.  [ 64 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Test – board boundaries I We should start by checking whether a piece is placed within the boundaries of the 3x3 board:  package com.packtpublishing.tddjava.ch03tictactoe;  import org.junit.Before; import org.junit.Rule; import org.junit.Test; import org.junit.rules.ExpectedException;  public class TicTacToeSpec {   @Rule   public ExpectedException exception = ExpectedException.none  ;   private TicTacToe ticTacToe;    @Before   public final void before   {     ticTacToe = new TicTacToe  ;   }   @Test   public void whenXOutsideBoardThenRuntimeException   {     exception.expect RuntimeException.class ;     ticTacToe.play 5, 2 ;   } }  When a piece is placed anywhere outside the x-axis, then RuntimeException is thrown.  In this test, we are defining that RuntimeException is expected when the ticTacToe.play 5, 2  method is invoked. It's a very short and easy test, and making it pass should be easy as well. All we have to do is create the play method and make sure that it throws RuntimeException when the x argument is smaller than 1 or bigger than 3  the board is 3x3 . You should run this test three times. The first time, it should fail because the play method doesn't exist. Once it is added, it should fail because RuntimeException is not thrown. The third time, it should be successful because the code that corresponds with this test is fully implemented.  [ 65 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Implementation Now that we have a clear definition of when an exception should be thrown, the implementation should be straightforward:  package com.packtpublishing.tddjava.ch03tictactoe;  public class TicTacToe {   public void play int x, int y  {     if  x   3  {       throw new RuntimeException "X is outside board" ;     }   } }  As you can see, this code does not contain anything else, but the bare minimum required for the test to pass.  Some TDD practitioners tend to take minimum as a literal meaning. They would have the play method with only the throw new RuntimeException  ; line. I tend to translate minimum to as little as possible within reason.  We're not adding numbers, nor are we returning anything. It's all about making small changes very fast.  Remember the game of ping pong?  For now, we're doing red-green steps. There's not much we can do to improve this code so we're skipping the refactoring.  Let's move on to the next test.  Test – board boundaries II This test is almost the same as the previous one. This time we should validate the y-axis:  @Test public void whenYOutsideBoardThenRuntimeException   {   exception.expect RuntimeException.class ;   ticTacToe.play 2, 5 ; }  When a piece is placed anywhere outside the y-axis, then RuntimeException is thrown.  [ 66 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Implementation The implementation of this specification is almost the same as the previous one. All we have to do is throw an exception if y does not fall within the defined range:  public void play int x, int y  {   if  x   3  {     throw new RuntimeException "X is outside board" ;   } else if  y   3  {     throw new RuntimeException "Y is outside board" ;   } }  In order for the last test to pass, we had to add the else clause that checks whether Y is inside the board.  Let's do the last test for this requirement.  Test – occupied spot Now that we know that pieces are placed within the board's boundaries, we should make sure that they can be placed only on unoccupied spaces:  @Test public void whenOccupiedThenRuntimeException   {   ticTacToe.play 2, 1 ;   exception.expect RuntimeException.class ;   ticTacToe.play 2, 1 ; }  When a piece is placed on an occupied space, then RuntimeException is thrown.  That's it; this was our last test. Once the implementation is finished, we can consider the first requirement as done.  [ 67 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Implementation To implement the last test, we should store the location of the placed pieces in an array. Every time a new piece is placed, we should verify that the place is not occupied, or else throw an exception:  private Character[][] board = {   {'\0', '\0', '\0'},   {'\0', '\0', '\0'},   {'\0', '\0', '\0'} };  public void play int x, int y  {   if  x   3  {     throw new RuntimeException "X is outside board" ;   } else if  y   3  {     throw new RuntimeException "Y is outside board" ;   }   if  board[x - 1][y - 1] != '\0'  {     throw new RuntimeException "Box is occupied" ;   } else {     board[x - 1][y - 1] = 'X';   } }  We're checking whether a place that was played is occupied and, if it is not, we're changing the array entry value from empty  \0  to occupied  X . Keep in mind that we're still not storing who played  X or O .  Refactoring While the code that we have done so far fulfills the requirements set by the tests, it looks a bit confusing. If someone read it, it would not be clear as to what the play method does. We should refactor it by moving the code into separate methods. The refactored code will look like the following:  public void play int x, int y  {   checkAxis x ;   checkAxis y ;   setBox x, y ; }  private void checkAxis int axis  {   if  axis   3  {     throw new RuntimeException "X is outside board" ;  [ 68 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3    } }  private void setBox int x, int y  {   if  board[x - 1][y - 1] != '\0'  {     throw new RuntimeException "Box is occupied" ;   } else {     board[x - 1][y - 1] = 'X';   } }  With this refactoring, we did not change the functionality of the play method. It behaves exactly the same as it behaved before, but the new code is a bit more readable. Since we had tests that covered all the existing functionality, there was no fear that we might do something wrong. As long as all tests are passing all the time and refactoring did not introduce any new behavior, it is safe to make changes to the code.  The source code can be found in the 01-exceptions branch of the tdd-java-ch03-tic- tac-toe Git repository at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac-toe branch 01-exceptions.  Requirement 2 – adding two-player support Now it's time to work on the specification of which player is about to play his turn.  There should be a way to find out which player should play next.  We can split this requirement into three tests:  The first turn should be played by player X If the last turn was played by X, then the next turn should be played by O If the last turn was played by O, then the next turn should be played by X  Until this moment, we haven't used any of the JUnit's asserts. To use them, we need to import the static methods from the org.junit.Assert class:  import static org.junit.Assert.*;  [ 69 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  In their essence, methods inside the Assert class are very simple. Most of them start with assert. For example, assertEquals compares two objects—assertNotEquals verifies that two objects are not the same and assertArrayEquals verifies that two arrays are the same. Each of those asserts has many overloaded variations so that almost any type of Java object can be used.  In our case, we'll need to compare two characters. The first is the one we're expecting and the second one is the actual character retrieved from the nextPlayer method.  Now it's time to write those tests and the implementation.  Write the test before writing the implementation code .  The benefits of doing this are as follows—it ensures that testable code is written and ensures that every line of code gets tests written for it.  By writing or modifying the test first, the developer is focused on requirements before starting to work on a code. This is the main difference when compared to writing tests after the implementation is done. An additional benefit is that with tests first, we are avoiding the danger that the tests work as quality checking instead of quality assurance.  Test – X plays first Player X has the first turn:  @Test public void givenFirstTurnWhenNextPlayerThenX   {   assertEquals 'X', ticTacToe.nextPlayer   ; }  The first turn should be played by Player X.  This test should be self-explanatory. We are expecting the nextPlayer method to return X. If you try to run this, you'll see that the code does not even compile. That's because the nextPlayer method does not even exist. Our job is to write the nextPlayer method and make sure that it returns the correct value.  [ 70 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Implementation There's no real need to check whether it really is the player's first turn or not. As it stands, this test can be fulfilled by always returning X. Later tests will force us to refine this code:  public char nextPlayer   {   return 'X'; }  Test – O plays right after X Now, we should make sure that players are changing. After X is finished, it should be O's turn, then again X, and so on:  @Test public void givenLastTurnWasXWhenNextPlayerThenO   {   ticTacToe.play 1, 1 ;   assertEquals 'O', ticTacToe.nextPlayer   ; }  If the last turn was played by X, then the next turn should be played by O.  Implementation In order to track who should play next, we need to store who played last:  private char lastPlayer = '\0';  public void play int x, int y  {   checkAxis x ;   checkAxis y ;   setBox x, y ;   lastPlayer = nextPlayer  ; }  public char nextPlayer   {   if  lastPlayer == 'X'  {     return 'O';   }   return 'X'; }  [ 71 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  You are probably starting to get the hang of it. Tests are small and easy to write. With enough experience, it should take a minute, if not seconds, to write a test and as much time or less to write the implementation.  Test – X plays right after O Finally, we can check whether X's turn comes after O played.  If the last turn was played by O, then the next turn should be played by X.  There's nothing to do to fulfill this test and, therefore, the test is useless and should be discarded. If you write this test, you'll discover that it is a false positive. It would pass without changing the implementation; try it out. Write this test and if it is successful without writing any implementation code, discard it.  The source code can be found in the 02-next-player branch of the tdd-java-ch03-tic- tac-toe Git repository at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac-toe branch 02-next-player.  Requirement 3 – adding winning conditions It's time to work on winning according to the rules of the game. This is the part where, when compared with the previous code, work becomes a bit more tedious. We should check all the possible winning combinations and, if one of them is fulfilled, declare a winner.  A player wins by being the first to connect a line of friendly pieces from one side or corner of the board to the other.  To check whether a line of friendly pieces is connected, we should verify horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.  [ 72 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Test – by default there's no winner Let's start by defining the default response of the play method:  @Test public void whenPlayThenNoWinner   {   String actual = ticTacToe.play 1,1 ;   assertEquals "No winner", actual ; }  If no winning condition is fulfilled, then there is no winner.  Implementation The default return values are always easiest to implement and this one is no exception:  public String play int x, int y  {   checkAxis x ;   checkAxis y ;   setBox x, y ;   lastPlayer = nextPlayer  ;   return "No winner"; }  Test – winning condition I Now that we have declared what the default response is  No winner , it's time to start working on different winning conditions:  @Test public void whenPlayAndWholeHorizontalLineThenWinner   {   ticTacToe.play 1, 1 ;    X   ticTacToe.play 1, 2 ;    O   ticTacToe.play 2, 1 ;    X   ticTacToe.play 2, 2 ;    O   String actual = ticTacToe.play 3, 1 ;    X   assertEquals "X is the winner", actual ; }  [ 73 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  The player wins when the whole horizontal line is occupied by his pieces.  Implementation To fulfill this test, we need to check whether any horizontal line is filled by the same mark as the current player. Until this moment, we didn't care what was put on the board array. Now, we need to introduce not only which board boxes are empty, but also which player played them:  public String play int x, int y  {   checkAxis x ;   checkAxis y ;   lastPlayer = nextPlayer  ;   setBox x, y, lastPlayer ;   for  int index = 0; index < 3; index++  {     if  board[0][index] == lastPlayer         && board[1][index] == lastPlayer         && board[2][index] == lastPlayer  {       return lastPlayer + " is the winner";     }   }   return "No winner"; } private void setBox int x, int y, char lastPlayer  {   if  board[x - 1][y - 1] != '\0'  {     throw new RuntimeException "Box is occupied" ;   } else {     board[x - 1][y - 1] = lastPlayer;   } }  Refactoring The preceding code satisfies the tests, but is not necessarily the final version. It served its purpose of getting code coverage as quickly as possible. Now, since we have tests that guarantee the integrity of the expected behavior, we can refactor the code:  private static final int SIZE = 3;  public String play int x, int y  {   checkAxis x ;  [ 74 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3    checkAxis y ;   lastPlayer = nextPlayer  ;   setBox x, y, lastPlayer ;   if  isWin    {     return lastPlayer + " is the winner";   }   return "No winner"; }  private boolean isWin   {   for  int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++  {     if  board[0][i] + board[1][i] + board[2][i] ==  lastPlayer * SIZE   {       return true;     }   }   return false; }  This refactored solution looks better. The play method keeps being short and easy to understand. Winning logic is moved to a separate method. Not only have we kept the play method's purpose clear, but this separation also allows us to grow the winning condition's code in separation from the rest.  Test – winning condition II We should also check whether there is a win by filling the vertical line:  @Test public void whenPlayAndWholeVerticalLineThenWinner   {   ticTacToe.play 2, 1 ;    X   ticTacToe.play 1, 1 ;    O   ticTacToe.play 3, 1 ;    X   ticTacToe.play 1, 2 ;    O   ticTacToe.play 2, 2 ;    X   String actual = ticTacToe.play 1, 3 ;    O   assertEquals "O is the winner", actual ; }  The player wins when the whole vertical line is occupied by his pieces.  [ 75 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Implementation This implementation should be similar to the previous one. We already have horizontal verification and now we need to do the same vertically:  private boolean isWin   {   int playerTotal = lastPlayer * 3;   for  int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++  {     if  board[0][i] + board[1][i] + board[2][i] == playerTotal  {       return true;     } else if  board[i][0] + board[i][1] + board[i][2] == playerTotal  {       return true;     }   }   return false; }  Test – winning condition III Now that horizontal and vertical lines are covered, we should move our attention to diagonal combinations:  @Test public void whenPlayAndTopBottomDiagonalLineThenWinner   {   ticTacToe.play 1, 1 ;    X   ticTacToe.play 1, 2 ;    O   ticTacToe.play 2, 2 ;    X   ticTacToe.play 1, 3 ;    O   String actual = ticTacToe.play 3, 3 ;    X   assertEquals "X is the winner", actual ; }  The player wins when the whole diagonal line from the top-left to bottom- right is occupied by his pieces.  [ 76 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Implementation Since there is only one line that can constitute with the requirement, we can check it directly without any loops:  private boolean isWin   {   int playerTotal = lastPlayer * 3;   for  int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++  {     if  board[0][i] + board[1][i] + board[2][i] == playerTotal  {       return true;     } else if  board[i][0] + board[i][1] + board[i][2] == playerTotal  {       return true;     }   }   if  board[0][0] + board[1][1] + board[2][2] == playerTotal  {     return true;   }   return false; }  Test – winning condition IV Finally, there is the last possible winning condition to tackle:  @Test public void whenPlayAndBottomTopDiagonalLineThenWinner   {   ticTacToe.play 1, 3 ;    X   ticTacToe.play 1, 1 ;    O   ticTacToe.play 2, 2 ;    X   ticTacToe.play 1, 2 ;    O   String actual = ticTacToe.play 3, 1 ;    X   assertEquals "X is the winner", actual ; }  The player wins when the whole diagonal line from the bottom-left to top- right is occupied by his pieces.  [ 77 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Implementation The implementation of this test should be almost the same as the previous one:  private boolean isWin   {   int playerTotal = lastPlayer * 3;   for  int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++  {     if  board[0][i] + board[1][i] + board[2][i] == playerTotal  {       return true;     } else if  board[i][0] + board[i][1] + board[i][2] == playerTotal  {       return true;     }   }   if  board[0][0] + board[1][1] + board[2][2] == playerTotal  {     return true;   } else if  board[0][2] + board[1][1] + board[2][0] == playerTotal  {     return true;   }   return false; }  Refactoring The way we're handling possible diagonal wins, the calculation doesn't look right. Maybe the reutilization of the existing loop would make more sense:  private boolean isWin   {   int playerTotal = lastPlayer * 3;   char diagonal1 = '\0';   char diagonal2 = '\0';   for  int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++  {     diagonal1 += board[i][i];     diagonal2 += board[i][SIZE - i - 1];     if  board[0][i] + board[1][i] + board[2][i]  == playerTotal  {       return true;     } else if  board[i][0] + board[i][1] + board[i][2] == playerTotal  {       return true;     }   }   if  diagonal1 == playerTotal  diagonal2 == playerTotal  {     return true;   }   return false;  [ 78 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  }  The source code can be found in the 03-wins branch of the tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac-toe Git repository at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac-toe branch 03-wins.  Now, let's go through the last requirement.  Requirement 4 – tie conditions The only thing missing is how to tackle the draw result.  The result is a draw when all the boxes are filled.  Test – handling a tie situation We can test the draw result by filling all the board's boxes:  @Test public void whenAllBoxesAreFilledThenDraw   {   ticTacToe.play 1, 1 ;   ticTacToe.play 1, 2 ;   ticTacToe.play 1, 3 ;   ticTacToe.play 2, 1 ;   ticTacToe.play 2, 3 ;   ticTacToe.play 2, 2 ;   ticTacToe.play 3, 1 ;   ticTacToe.play 3, 3 ;   String actual = ticTacToe.play 3, 2 ;   assertEquals "The result is draw", actual ; }  [ 79 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Implementation Checking whether it's a draw is fairly straightforward. All we have to do is check whether all the board's boxes are filled. We can do that by iterating through the board array:  public String play int x, int y  {   checkAxis x ;   checkAxis y ;   lastPlayer = nextPlayer  ;   setBox x, y, lastPlayer ;   if  isWin    {     return lastPlayer + " is the winner";   } else if  isDraw    {     return "The result is draw";   } else {     return "No winner";   } }  private boolean isDraw   {   for  int x = 0; x < SIZE; x++  {     for  int y = 0; y < SIZE; y++  {       if  board[x][y] == '\0'  {         return false;       }     }   }   return true; }  Refactoring Even though the isWin method is not the scope of the last test, it can still be refactored even more. For once, we don't need to check all the combinations, but only those related to the position of the last piece played. The final version could look like the following:  private boolean isWin int x, int y  {   int playerTotal = lastPlayer * 3;   char horizontal, vertical, diagonal1, diagonal2;   horizontal = vertical = diagonal1 = diagonal2 = '\0';   for  int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++  {     horizontal += board[i][y - 1];     vertical += board[x - 1][i];     diagonal1 += board[i][i];     diagonal2 += board[i][SIZE - i - 1];   }  [ 80 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3    if  horizontal == playerTotal        vertical == playerTotal        diagonal1 == playerTotal        diagonal2 == playerTotal  {     return true;   }   return false; }  Refactoring can be done on any part of the code at any time, as long as all the tests are successful. While it's often easiest and fastest to refactor the code that was just written, going back to something that was written the other day, previous month, or even years ago, is more than welcome. The best time to refactor something is when someone sees an opportunity to make it better. It doesn't matter who wrote it or when; making the code better is always a good thing to do.  The source code can be found in the 04-draw branch of the tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac-toe Git repository at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac-toe branch 04-draw.  Code coverage We did not use code coverage tools throughout this exercise. The reason is that we wanted you to be focused on the Red-Green-Refactor model. You wrote a test, saw it fail, wrote the implementation code, saw that all the tests were executed successfully, refactored the code whenever you saw an opportunity to make it better, and then you repeated the process. Did our tests cover all cases? That's something that code coverage tools such as JaCoCo can answer. Should you use those tools? Probably, only in the beginning. Let me clarify that. When you are starting with TDD, you will probably miss some tests or implement more than what the tests defined. In those cases, using code coverage is a good way to learn from your own mistakes. Later on, the more experienced you become with TDD, the less of a need you'll have for such tools. You'll write tests and just enough of the code to make them pass. Your coverage will be high with or without tools such as JaCoCo. There will be a small amount of code not covered by tests because you'll make a conscious decision about what is not worth testing.  Tools such as JaCoCo were designed mostly as a way to verify that the tests written after the implementation code are providing enough coverage. With TDD, we are taking a different approach with the inverted order  tests before the implementation .  [ 81 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  Still, we suggest you use JaCoCo as a learning tool and decide for yourself whether to use it in the future.  To enable JaCoCo within Gradle, add the following to build.gradle:  apply plugin: 'jacoco'  From now on, Gradle will collect JaCoCo metrics every time we run tests. Those metrics can be transformed into a nice report using the jacocoTestReport Gradle target. Let's run our tests again and see what the code coverage is:  $ gradle clean test jacocoTestReport  The end result is the report located in the build reports jacoco test html directory. Results will vary depending on the solution you made for this exercise. My results say that there is a 100% of instructions coverage and 96% of branches coverage; 4% is missing because there was no test case where the player played on a box 0 or negative. The implementation of that case is there, but there is no specific test that covers it. Overall, this is a pretty good coverage:  JaCoCo will be added in the source code. This is found in the 05-jacoco branch of the tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac-toe Git repository at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch03-tic-tac-toe branch 05-jacoco.  [ 82 ]   Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection  Chapter 3  More exercises We just developed one  most commonly used  variation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. As an additional exercise, pick one or more variations from Wikipedia  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Tic-tac-toe  and implement it using the Red-Green- Refactor procedure. When finished, implement a kind of AI that would play O's turns. Since Tic-Tac-Toe usually leads to a draw, AI can be considered finished when it successfully reaches a draw for any combination of X's moves.  While working on those exercises, remember to be fast and play ping pong. Also, most of all, remember to use the Red-Green-Refactor procedure.  Summary We managed to finish our Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Red-Green-Refactor process. The examples themselves were simple and you probably didn't have a problem following them.  The objective of this chapter was not to dive into something complicated  that comes later , but to get into the habit of using the short and repetitive cycle called Red-Green-Refactor.  We learned that the easiest way to develop something is by splitting it into very small chunks. The design was emerging from tests instead of using a big upfront approach. No line of the implementation code was written without writing a test first and seeing it fail. By confirming that the last test fails, we are confirming that it is valid  it's easy to make a mistake and write a test that is always successful  and the feature we are about to implement does not exist. After the test failed, we wrote the implementation of that test. While writing the implementation, we tried to make it a minimal one with the objective being to make the test pass, not to make the solution final. We repeated this process until we felt that there was a need to refactor the code. Refactoring did not introduce any new functionality  we did not change what the application does , but made the code more optimal and easier to read and maintain.  In the next chapter, we'll elaborate in more detail about what constitutes a unit within the context of TDD and how to approach the creation of tests based on those units.  [ 83 ]   4  Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  "To create something exceptional, your mindset must be relentlessly focused on the smallest detail."  – Giorgio Armani  As promised, each chapter will explore a different Java testing framework and this one is no exception. We'll use TestNG to build our specifications.  In the previous Chapter 3, Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection, we practiced the Red-Green-Refactor procedure. We used unit tests without going deeper into how unit testing works in the context of TDD. We'll build on the knowledge from the last chapter and go into more detail by trying to explain what unit tests really are and how they fit into the TDD approach to building software.  The goal of this chapter is to learn how to focus on the unit we're currently working on and how to ignore or isolate those that were done before.  Once we're comfortable with TestNG and unit testing, we'll dive right into the requirements of our next application and start coding.   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  Unit testing Unit testing with TDD TestNG Remote-controlled ship requirements Developing the remote-controlled ship  Unit testing Frequent manual testing is too impractical for any but the smallest systems. The only way around this is the use of automated tests. They are the only effective method to reduce the time and cost of building, deploying, and maintaining applications. In order to effectively manage applications, it is of the utmost importance that both the implementation and test codes are as simple as possible. Simplicity is one of the core extreme programming  XP  values  http:  www.extremeprogramming.org rules simple.html  and the key to TDD and programming in general. It is most often accomplished through division into small units. In Java, units are methods. Being the smallest, the feedback loop they provide is the fastest so we spend most of our time thinking and working on them. As a counterpart to implementation methods, unit tests should constitute by far the biggest percentage of all tests.  What is unit testing? Unit testing is a practice that forces us to test small, individual, and isolated units of code. They are usually methods, even though in some cases classes or even whole applications can be considered to be units, as well. In order to write unit tests, code under tests needs to be isolated from the rest of the application. Preferably, that isolation is already ingrained in the code or it can be accomplished with the use of mocks  more on mocks will be covered in Chapter 6, Mocking – Removing External Dependencies . If unit tests of a particular method cross the boundaries of that unit, then they become integration tests. As such, it becomes less clear what is under the tests. In case of a failure, the scope of a problem suddenly increases and finding the cause becomes more tedious.  [ 85 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  Why unit testing? A common question, especially within organizations that rely heavily on manual testing, is Why should we use unit instead of functional and integration testing? This question in itself is flawed. Unit testing does not replace other types of testing. Instead, unit testing reduces the scope of other types of tests. By its nature, unit testing is easier and faster to write than any other type of tests, thus reducing the cost and time to market  TTM . Due to the reduced time to write and run them, they tend to detect problems much sooner. The faster we detect problems, the cheaper it is to fix them. A bug that was detected minutes after it was created is much easier to fix than if that same bug was found days, weeks, or even months after it was made.  Code refactoring Code refactoring is the process of changing the structure of an existing code without changing its external behavior. The purpose of refactoring is to improve an existing code. This improvement can be made for many different reasons. We might want to make the code more readable, less complex, easier to maintain, cheaper to extend, and so on. No matter what the reason for refactoring is, the ultimate goal is always to make it better in one way or another. The effect of this goal is a reduction in technical debt; a reduction in pending work that needs to be done due to suboptimal design, architecture, or coding.  Typically, we approach refactoring by applying a set of small changes without modifying intended behavior. Reducing the scope of refactoring changes allows us continuously to confirm that those changes did not break any existing functionality. The only way to effectively obtain this confirmation is through the use of automated tests.  One of the great benefits of unit tests is that they are the best refactoring enablers. Refactoring is too risky when there are no automated tests to confirm that the application still behaves as expected. While any type of test can be used to provide the code coverage required for refactoring, in most cases only unit tests can provide the required level of details.  Why not use unit tests exclusively? At this moment, you might be wondering whether unit testing could provide a solution for all your testing needs. Unfortunately, that is not the case. While unit tests usually cover the biggest percentage of your testing needs, functional and integration tests should be an integral part of your testing toolbox.  [ 86 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  We'll cover other types of tests in more detail in later chapters. For now, a few important distinctions between them are as follows:  Unit tests try to verify small units of functionality. In the Java world, those units are methods. All external dependencies, such as invocations of other classes and methods or database calls, should be done in memory with the use of mocks, stubs, spies, fakes, and dummies. Gerard Meszaros coined a more general term, test doubles, that envelops all those  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Test_double . Unit tests are simple, easy to write, and fast to run. They are usually the biggest percentage of a testing suite. Functional and acceptance tests have a job to verify that the application we're  building works as expected, as a whole. While those two differ in their purpose, both share a similar goal. Unlike unit tests that are verifying the internal quality of the code, functional and acceptance tests are trying to ensure that the system is working correctly from the customer's or user's point of view. Those tests are usually smaller in number when compared with unit tests due to the cost and effort needed to both write and run them. Integration tests intend to verify that separate units, modules, applications, or even whole systems are properly integrated with each other. You might have a frontend application that uses backend APIs that, in turn, communicate with a database. The job of integration tests would be to verify that all three of those separate components of the system are indeed integrated and can communicate with each other. Since we already know that all the units are working and all functional and acceptance tests are passed, integration tests are usually the smallest of all three as their job is only to confirm that all the pieces are working well together:  [ 87 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  The testing pyramid states that you should have many more unit tests than higher-level tests  UI tests, integration tests, and so on . Why is that? Unit tests are much cheaper to write, faster to run, and, at the same time, provide much bigger coverage. Take, for example, registration functionality. We should test what happens when a username is empty, when a password is empty, when a username or password is not in the correct format, when the user already exists, and so on. Only for this single functionality there can be tens, if not hundreds of tests. Writing and running all those tests from the UI can be very expensive  time-consuming to write and slow to run . On the other hand, unit testing a method that does this validation is easy, fast to write, and fast to run. If all those cases are covered with unit tests, we could be satisfied with a single integration test that checks whether our UI is calling the correct method on the backend. If it is, details are irrelevant from an integration point of view since we know that all cases are already covered on the unit level.  Unit testing with TDD What is the difference in the way we write unit tests in the context of TDD? The major differentiator is in when. While traditionally unit tests are written after the implementation code is done, in TDD we write tests before—the order of things is inverted. Without TDD, the purpose of unit tests is to validate an existing code. TDD teaches us that unit tests should drive our development and design. They should define the behavior of the smallest possible unit. They are micro-requirements pending development. A test tells you what to do next and when you're done doing it. Depending on the type of tests  unit, functional, integration, and so on , the scope of what should be done next differs. In the case of TDD with unit tests, this scope is the smallest possible, meaning a method or, more often, a part of it. Moreover, with TDD driven by unit tests, we are forced to comply to some design principles, such as keep it simple, stupid  KISS . By writing simple tests with a very small scope, the implementation of those tests tends to be simple as well. By forcing tests not to use external dependencies, we are forcing the implementation code to have a separation of concerns that is well-designed. There are many other examples of how TDD helps us to write better code. Those same benefits cannot be accomplished with unit testing alone. Without TDD, unit tests are forced to work with an existing code and have no influence on the design.  To summarize, the main goal of unit testing without TDD is the validation of the existing code. Unit testing written in advance using the TDD procedure has the main objective specification and design, with validation being a side product. This side product is often of a higher quality than when tests are written after the implementation.  [ 88 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  TDD forces us to think through our requirements and design, write clean code that works, create executable requirements, and refactor safely and often. On top of all that, we end up with high test code coverage that is used to regression-test all our code whenever some change is introduced. Unit testing without TDD gives us only tests and, often, with doubtful quality.  TestNG JUnit and TestNG are two major Java testing frameworks. You already wrote tests with JUnit in the previous chapter, Chapter 3, Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection,  and, hopefully, got a good understanding of how it works. How about TestNG? It was born out of a desire to make JUnit better. Indeed, it contains some functionalities that JUnit doesn't have.  The following subsections summarize some of the differences between the two of them. We'll try not only to provide an explanation of the differences, but also their evaluation in the context of unit testing with TDD.  The @Test annotation Both JUnit and TestNG use the @Test annotation to specify which method is considered to be a test. Unlike JUnit, which requires every method to be annotated with @Test, TestNG allows us to use this annotation on a class level, as well. When used in this way, all public methods are considered tests unless specified otherwise:  @Test public class DirectionSpec {   public void whenGetFromShortNameNThenReturnDirectionN   {     Direction direction = Direction.getFromShortName 'N' ;     assertEquals direction, Direction.NORTH ;   }    public void whenGetFromShortNameWThenReturnDirectionW   {     Direction direction = Direction.getFromShortName 'W' ;     assertEquals direction, Direction.WEST ;   } }  [ 89 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  In this example, we put the @Test annotation above the DirectionSpec class. As a result, both the whenGetFromShortNameNThenReturnDirectionN and whenGetFromShortNameWThenReturnDirectionW methods are considered tests. If that code was written using JUnit, both the methods would need to have the @Test annotation.  The @BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, @BeforeGroups, @AfterGroups, @AfterTest, and @AfterSuite annotations Those six annotations do not have their equivalents in JUnit. TestNG can group tests into suites, using XML configuration. Methods annotated with @BeforeSuite and @AfterSuite are run before and after all the tests in the specified suite have run. Similarly, the @BeforeTest and @AfterTest annotated methods are run before any test method belonging to the test classes has run. Finally, TestNG tests can be organized into groups. The @BeforeGroups and @AfterGroups annotations allow us to run methods before the first test and after the last test, in specified groups, are run.  While those annotations can be very useful when tests are written after the implementation code, they do not provide much usage in the context of TDD. Unlike traditional testing, which is often planned and written as a separate project, TDD teaches us to write one test at a time and keep everything simple. Most importantly, unit tests are supposed to run quickly so there is no need to group them into suites or groups. When tests are fast, running anything less than everything is a waste. If, for example, all tests are run in less than 15 seconds, there is no need to run only a part of them. On the other hand, when tests are slow, it is often a sign that external dependencies are not isolated. No matter what the reason is behind slow tests, the solution is not to run only a part of them, but to fix the problem.  Moreover, functional and integration tests do tend to be slower and require us to have some kind of separation. However, it is better to separate them in, for example, build.gradle so that each type of test is run as a separate task.  [ 90 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  The @BeforeClass and @AfterClass annotations These annotations have the same function in both JUnit and TestNG. Annotated methods will be run before the first test and after the last test, in a current class. The only difference is that TestNG does not require those methods to be static. The reason behind this can be found in the different approaches those two frameworks take when running test methods. JUnit isolates each test into its own instance of the test class, forcing us to have those methods defined as static and, therefore, reusable across all test runs. TestNG, on the other hand, executes all test methods in the context of a single test class instance, eliminating the need for those methods to be static.  The @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod annotations The @Before and @After annotations are equivalent to JUnit. Annotated methods are run before and after each test method.  The @Test enable = false  annotation argument Both JUnit and TestNG can disable tests. While JUnit uses a separate @Ignore annotation, TestNG uses the @Test annotation Boolean argument, enable. Functionally, both work in the same way and the difference is only in the way we write them.  The @Test expectedExceptions = SomeClass.class  annotation argument This is the case where JUnit has the advantage. While both provide the same way to specify the expected exception  in the case of JUnit, the argument is called simply expected , JUnit introduces rules that are a more elegant way to test exceptions  we already worked with them in Chapter 2, Tools, Frameworks, and Environment .  TestNG versus JUnit summary There are many other differences between those two frameworks. For brevity, we do not cover all of them in this book. Consult their documentation for further information.  [ 91 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  More information about JUnit and TestNG can be found at http:  junit.org  and http:  testng.org .  TestNG provides more features and is more advanced than JUnit. We'll work with TestNG throughout this chapter, and you'll get to know it better. One thing that you'll notice is that we won't use any of those advanced features. The reason is that, with TDD, we rarely need them when working with unit tests. Functional and integration tests are of a different kind and would serve as a better demonstration of TestNG's superiority. However, there are tools that are more suited for those types of tests, as you'll see in the following chapters.  Which one should you use? I'll leave that choice up to you. By the time you finish this chapter, you'll have hands-on knowledge of both JUnit and TestNG.  Remote-controlled ship requirements We'll work on a variation of a well-known kata called Mars Rover, originally published in Dallas Hack Club  http:  dallashackclub.com rover .  Imagine that a naval ship is placed somewhere on Earth's seas. Since this is the 21st century, we can control that ship remotely.  Our job will be to create a program that can move the ship around the seas.  Since this is a TDD book and the subject of this chapter is unit tests, we'll develop an application using a TDD approach with the focus on unit tests. In the previous chapter, Chapter 3, Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection, you learned the theory and had practical experience with the Red-Green-Refactor procedure. We'll build on top of that and try to learn how to employ unit testing effectively. Specifically, we'll try to concentrate on a unit we're developing and learn how to isolate and ignore dependencies that a unit might use. Not only that, but we'll try to concentrate on one requirement at a time. For this reason, you were presented only with high-level requirements; we should be able to move the remote-controlled ship, located somewhere on the planet, around.  [ 92 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  To make things easier, all the supporting classes have been already made and tested. This will allow us to concentrate on the main task at hand and, at the same time, keep this exercise concise.   Developing the remote-controlled ship Let's start by importing the existing Git repository.  Project setup Let's start setting up the project:  1.  2.  Open IntelliJ IDEA. If an existing project is already opened, select FileClose Project.  You will be presented with a screen similar to the following:  [ 93 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  3.  To import the project from the Git repository, click on Check out from Version Control and select Git. Type https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch04-ship.git in to the Git Repository URL field and click on Clone:  4.  Answer Yes when asked whether you would like to open the project. Next you will be presented with the Import Project from Gradle dialog. Click on OK:  [ 94 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  5.  IDEA will need to spend some time downloading the dependencies specified in the build.gradle file. Once that is done, you'll see that some classes and corresponding tests are already created:  Helper classes Imagine that a colleague of yours started working on this project. He's a good programmer and a TDD practitioner, and you trust his abilities to have good test code coverage. In other words, you can rely on his work. However, that colleague did not finish the application before he left for his vacations and it's up to you to continue where he stopped. He created all the helper classes: Direction, Location, Planet, and Point. You'll notice that the corresponding test classes are there as well. They have the same name as the class they're testing with the Spec suffix  that is, DirectionSpec . The reason for using this suffix is to make clear that tests are not only intended to validate the code, but also to serve as an executable specification.  [ 95 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  On top of the helper classes, you'll find the Ship  implementation  and ShipSpec  specifications tests  classes. We'll spend most of our time in those two classes. We'll write tests in ShipSpec and then we'll write the implementation code in the Ship class  just as we did before .  Since we already learned that tests are not only used as a way to validate the code, but also as executable documentation, from this moment on, we'll use the phrase specification or spec instead of test.  Every time we finish writing a specification or the code that implements it, we'll run gradle test either from the command prompt or by using the Gradle projects IDEA Tool Window:  With the project set up, we're ready to dive into the first requirement.  Requirement – starting point and orientation We need to know what the current location of the ship is in order to be able to move it. Moreover, we should also know which direction it is facing: north, south, east, or west. Therefore, the first requirement is the following:  You are given the initial starting point  x, y  of a ship and the direction  N, S, E, or W  it is facing.  [ 96 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  Before we start working on this requirement, let's go through the helper classes that can be used. The Point class holds the x and y coordinates. It has the following constructor:  Similarly, we have the Direction enum class with the following values:  public Point int x, int y  {   this.x = x;   this.y = y; }  public enum Direction {   NORTH 0, 'N ,   EAST 1, 'E' ,   SOUTH 2, 'S' ,   WEST 3, 'W' ,   NONE 4, 'X' ; }  Finally, there is the Location class that requires both of those classes to be passed as constructor arguments:  public Location Point point, Direction direction  {   this.point = point;   this.direction = direction; }  Knowing this, it should be fairly easy to write a test for this first requirement. We should work in the same way as we did in the previous chapter, Chapter 3, Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection.  Try to write specs by yourself. When done, compare them with the solution in this book. Repeat the same process with the code that implements specs. Try to write it by yourself and, once done, compare it with the solution we're proposing.  Specification – keeping position and direction in memory The specification for this requirement can be the following:  @Test public class ShipSpec {   public void whenInstantiatedThenLocationIsSet   {     Location location = new Location new Point 21, 13 , Direction.NORTH ;     Ship ship = new Ship location ;  [ 97 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4      assertEquals ship.getLocation  , location ;   } }  This was an easy one. We're just checking whether the Location object we're passing as the Ship constructor is stored and can be accessed through the location getter.  The @Test annotation—When TestNG has the @Test annotation set on the class level, there is no need to specify which methods should be used as tests. In this case, all public methods are considered to be TestNG tests.  Implementation The implementation of this specification should be fairly easy. All we need to do is set the constructor argument to the location variable:  public class Ship {   private final Location location;   public Ship Location location  {     this.location = location;   }    public Location getLocation   {     return location;   } }  The full source can be found in the req01-location branch of the tdd-java-ch04-ship repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch04-ship branch req01-location .  Refactoring We know that we'll need to instantiate Ship for every spec, so we might as well refactor the specification class by adding the @BeforeMethod annotation. The code can be the following:  @Test public class ShipSpec {    private Ship ship;   private Location location;  [ 98 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4    @BeforeMethod   public void beforeTest   {     Location location = new Location new Point 21, 13 , Direction.NORTH ;     ship = new Ship location ;   }    public void whenInstantiatedThenLocationIsSet   {        Location location = new Location new Point 21, 13 , Direction.NORTH ;        Ship ship = new Ship location ;     assertEquals ship.getLocation  , location ;     } }  No new behavior has been introduced. We just moved part of the code to the @BeforeMethod annotation in order to avoid duplication, which would be produced by the rest of the specifications that we are about to write. Now, every time a test is run, the ship object will be instantiated with location as the argument.  Requirement – forward and backward moves Now that we know where our ship is, let's try to move it. To begin with, we should be able to go both forwards and backwards.  Implement commands that move the ship forwards and backwards  f and b .  The Location helper class already has the forward and backward methods that implement this functionality:  public boolean forward   {   ... }  Specification – moving forward What should happen when, for example, we are facing north and we move the ship forwards? Its location on the y-axis should decrease. Another example would be that when the ship is facing east, it should increase its x-axis location by 1.  [ 99 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  The first reaction can be to write specifications similar to the following two:  public void givenNorthWhenMoveForwardThenYDecreases   {   ship.moveForward  ;   assertEquals ship.getLocation  .getPoint  .getY  , 12 ; }  public void givenEastWhenMoveForwardThenXIncreases   {   ship.getLocation  .setDirection Direction.EAST ;   ship.moveForward  ;   assertEquals ship.getLocation  .getPoint  .getX  , 22 ; }  We should create at least two more specifications related to cases where a ship is facing south and west.  However, this is not how unit tests should be written. Most people new to unit testing fall into the trap of specifying the end result that requires the knowledge of the inner workings of methods, classes, and libraries used by the method that is being specified. This approach is problematic on many levels.  When including external code in the unit that is being specified, we should take into account, at least in our case, the fact that the external code is already tested. We know that it is working since we're running all the tests every time any change to the code is made.  Rerun all the tests every time the implementation code changes.   This ensures that there is no unexpected side-effect caused by code changes.  Every time any part of the implementation code changes, all tests should be run. Ideally, tests are fast to execute and can be run by a developer locally. Once code is submitted to the version control, all tests should be run again to ensure that there was no problem due to code merges. This is especially important when more than one developer is working on the code. CI tools, such as Jenkins, Hudson, Travind, Bamboo, and Go-CD should be used to pull the code from the repository, compile it, and run tests.  Another problem with this approach is that if an external code changes, there will be many more specifications to change. Ideally, we should be forced to change only specifications directly related to the unit that will be modified. Searching for all other places where that unit is called from might be very time-consuming and error-prone.  [ 100 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  A much easier, faster, and better way to write specifications for this requirement would be the following:  public void whenMoveForwardThenForward   {   Location expected = location.copy  ;   expected.forward  ;   ship.moveForward  ;   assertEquals ship.getLocation  , expected ; }  Since Location already has the forward method, all we'd need to do is to make sure that the proper invocation of that method is performed. We created a new Location object called expected, invoked the forward method, and compared that object with the location of the ship after its moveForward method is called.  Note that specifications are not only used to validate the code, but are also used as executable documentation and, most importantly, as a way to think and design. This second attempt specifies more clearly what the intent is behind it. We should create a moveForward method inside the Ship class and make sure that the location.forward is called.  Implementation With such a small and clearly defined specification, it should be fairly easy to write the code that implements it:  public boolean moveForward   {   return location.forward  ; }  Specification – moving backward Now that we have a forward movement specified and implemented, the backward movement should almost be the same:  public void whenMoveBackwardThenBackward   {   Location expected = location.copy  ;   expected.backward  ;   ship.moveBackward  ;   assertEquals ship.getLocation  , expected ; }  [ 101 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  Implementation Just like the specification, the backward movement implementation is just as easy:  public boolean moveBackward   {   return location.backward  ; }  The full source code for this requirement can be found in the req02-forward-backward branch of the tdd-java-ch04-ship repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch04-ship branch req02-forward- backward .  Requirement – rotating the ship Moving the ship only back and forth won't get us far. We should be able to change the direction by rotating the ship to the left or right as well.  Implement commands that turn the ship left and right  l and r .  After implementing the previous requirement, this one should be very easy since it can follow the same logic. The Location helper class already contains the turnLeft and turnRight methods that perform exactly what is required by this requirement. All we need to do is integrate them into the Ship class.  Specification – turning left Using the same guidelines as those we have used so far, the specification for turning left can be the following:  public void whenTurnLeftThenLeft   {   Location expected = location.copy  ;   expected.turnLeft  ;   ship.turnLeft  ;   assertEquals ship.getLocation  , expected ; }  [ 102 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  Implementation You probably did not have a problem writing the code to pass the previous specification:  public void turnLeft   {   location.turnLeft  ; }  Specification – turning right Turning right should be almost the same as turning left:  public void whenTurnRightThenRight   {   Location expected = location.copy  ;   expected.turnRight  ;   ship.turnRight  ;   assertEquals ship.getLocation  , expected ; }  Implementation Finally, let's finish this requirement by implementing the specification for turning right:  public void turnRight   {   location.turnRight  ; }  The full source for this requirement can be found in the req03-left-right branch of the tdd-java-ch04-ship repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch04-ship branch req03-left-right .  Requirement – commands Everything we have done so far was fairly easy since there were helper classes that provided all the functionality. This exercise was to learn how to stop attempting to test the end outcome and focus on a unit we're working on. We are building trust; we had to trust the code done by others  the helper classes .  [ 103 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  Starting from this requirement, you'll have to trust the code you wrote by yourself. We'll continue in the same fashion. We'll write specifications, run tests, and see them fail; we'll write implementations, run tests, and see them succeed; finally, we'll refactor if we think the code can be improved. Continue thinking how to test a unit  method  without going deeper into methods or classes that the unit will be invoking.  Now that we have individual commands  forwards, backwards, left, and right  implemented, it's time to tie it all together. We should create a method that will allow us to pass any number of commands as a single string. Each command should be a character with f meaning forwards, b being backwards, l for turning left, and r for turning right.  The ship can receive a string with commands  lrfb, which are equivalent to left, right, forwards, and backwards .  Specification – single commands Let's start with the command argument, that only has the f  forwards  character:  public void whenReceiveCommandsFThenForward   {   Location expected = location.copy  ;   expected.forward  ;   ship.receiveCommands "f" ;   assertEquals ship.getLocation  , expected ; }  This specification is almost the same as the whenMoveForwardThenForward specification except that, this time, we're invoking the ship.receiveCommands "f"  method.  Implementation We already spoke about the importance of writing the simplest possible code that passes the specification.  [ 104 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  Write the simplest code to pass the test. This ensures a cleaner and clearer design and avoids unnecessary features   The idea is that the simpler the implementation, the better and easier it is to maintain the product. The idea adheres to the KISS principle. It states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.  This is a good opportunity to apply this rule. You might be inclined to write a piece of code similar to the following:  public void receiveCommands String commands  {   if  commands.charAt 0  == 'f'  {     moveForward  ;   } }  In this example code, we are verifying whether the first character is f and, if it is, invoking the moveForward method. There are many other variations that we can do. However, if we stick to the simplicity principle, a better solution would be the following:  public void receiveCommands String command  {   moveForward  ; }  This is the simplest and shortest possible code that will make the specification pass. Later on, we might end up with something closer to the first version of the code; we might use some kind of a loop or come up with some other solution when things become more complicated. As for now, we are concentrating on one specification at a time and trying to make things simple. We are attempting to clear our mind by focusing only on the task at hand.  For brevity, the rest of the combinations  b, l, and r  are not presented here  continue to implement them by yourself . Instead, we'll jump to the last specification for this requirement.  [ 105 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  Specification – combined commands Now that we are able to process one command  whatever that the command is , it is time to add the option to send a string of commands. The specification can be the following:  public void whenReceiveCommandsThenAllAreExecuted   {   Location expected = location.copy  ;   expected.turnRight  ;   expected.forward  ;   expected.turnLeft  ;   expected.backward  ;   ship.receiveCommands "rflb" ;   assertEquals ship.getLocation  , expected ; }  This is a bit longer, but is still not an overly complicated specification. We're passing commands rflb  right, forwards, left, and backwards  and expecting that the Location changes accordingly. As before, we're not verifying the end result  seeing whether the if coordinates have changed , but checking whether we are invoking the correct calls to helper methods.  Implementation The end result can be the following:  public void receiveCommands String commands  {   for  char command : commands.toCharArray    {     switch command  {       case 'f':         moveForward  ;         break;       case 'b':         moveBackward  ;         break;       case 'l':         turnLeft  ;         break;       case 'r':         turnRight  ;         break;     }   } }  [ 106 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  If you tried to write specifications and the implementation by yourself and if you followed the simplicity rule, you probably had to refactor your code a couple of times in order to get to the final solution. Simplicity is the key and refactoring is often a welcome necessity. When refactoring, remember that all specifications must be passing all the time.  Refactor only after all the tests have passed.   Benefits: refactoring is safe.  If all the implementation code that can be affected has tests and if they are all passing, it is relatively safe to refactor. In most cases, there is no need for new tests; small modifications to existing tests should be enough. The expected outcome of refactoring is to have all the tests passing both before and after the code is modified.  The full source for this requirement can be found in the req04-commands branch of the tdd-java-ch04-ship repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch04-ship branch req04-commands .  Requirement – representing spheric maps Earth is a sphere, as is any other planet. When Earth is presented as a map, reaching one edge wraps us to another; for example, when we move east and reach the furthest point in the Pacific Ocean, we are wrapped to the west side of the map and we continue moving towards America. Furthermore, to make the movement easier, we can define the map as a grid. That grid should have length and height expressed as an x-axis and y-axis. That grid should have maximum length  x  and height  y .  Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another.  [ 107 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  Specification – planet information The first thing we can do is pass the Planet object with the maximum X and Y axis coordinates to the Ship constructor. Fortunately, Planet is one more of the helper classes that have already been made  and tested . All we need to do is instantiate it and pass it to the Ship constructor:  public void whenInstantiatedThenPlanetIsStored   {   Point max = new Point 50, 50 ;   Planet planet = new Planet max ;   ship = new Ship location, planet ;   assertEquals ship.getPlanet  , planet ; }  We're defining the size of the planet as 50 x 50 and passing that to the Planet class. In turn, that class is afterwards passed to the Ship constructor. You might have noticed that the constructor needs an extra argument. In the current code, our constructor requires only location. To implement this specification, it should accept planet, as well.  How would you implement this specification without breaking any of the existing specifications?  Implementation Let's take a bottom-up approach. An assert requires us to have a planet getter:  private Planet planet; public Planet getPlanet   {   return planet; }  Next, the constructor should accept Planet as a second argument and assign it to the previously added planet variable. The first attempt might be to add it to the existing constructor, but that would break many existing specifications that are using a single argument constructor. This leaves us with only one option—a second constructor:  public Ship Location location  {   this.location = location; } public Ship Location location, Planet planet  {   this.location = location;   this.planet = planet; }  [ 108 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  Run all the specifications and confirm that they are all successful.  Refactoring Our specifications forced us to create the second constructor, since changing the original one would break the existing tests. However, now that everything is green, we can do some refactoring and get rid of the single argument constructor. The specification class already has the beforeTest method that is run before each test. We can move everything, but the assert itself to this method:  public class ShipSpec { ...   private Planet planet;    @BeforeMethod   public void beforeTest   {     Point max = new Point 50, 50 ;     location = new Location new Point 21, 13 , Direction.NORTH ;     planet = new Planet max ;        ship = new Ship location ;     ship = new Ship location, planet ;   }    public void whenInstantiatedThenPlanetIsStored   {        Point max = new Point 50, 50 ;        Planet planet = new Planet max ;        ship = new Ship location, planet ;     assertEquals ship.getPlanet  , planet ;   } }  With this change, we effectively removed the usage of the Ship single argument constructor. By running all specifications, we should confirm that this change worked.  Now, with a single argument constructor that is not in use anymore, we can remove it from the implementation class, as well:  public class Ship { ...      public Ship Location location  {        this.location = location;      }   public Ship Location location, Planet planet  {     this.location = location;     this.planet = planet;  [ 109 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4    } ... }  By using this approach, all specifications were green all the time. Refactoring did not change any existing functionality, nothing got broken, and the whole process was done quickly.  Now, let's move into wrapping itself.  Specification – dealing with map boundaries Like in other cases, the helper classes already provide all the functionality that we need. So far, we used the location.forward method without arguments. To implement wrapping, there is the overloaded location.forward Point max  method that will wrap the location when we reach the end of the grid. With the previous specification, we made sure that Planet is passed to the Ship class and that it contains Point max. Our job is to make sure that max is used when moving forward. The specification can be the following:  public void whenOverpassingEastBoundaryThenPositionIsReset   {   location.setDirection Direction.EAST ;   location.getPoint  .setX planet.getMax  .getX   ;   ship.receiveCommands "f" ;   assertEquals location.getX  , 1 ; }  Implementation By now, you should be getting used to focusing on one unit at a time and to trust that those that were done before are working as expected. This implementation should be no different. We just need to make sure that the maximum coordinates are used when the location.forward method is called:  public boolean moveForward   {      return location.forward  ;   return location.forward planet.getMax   ; }  The same specification and implementation should be done for the backward method. For brevity, it is excluded from this book, but it can be found in the source code.  [ 110 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  The full source for this requirement can be found in the req05-wrap branch of the tdd- java-ch04-ship repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch04-ship branch req05-wrap .  Requirement – detecting obstacles  We're almost done. This is the last requirement.  Even though most of the Earth is covered in water  approximately 70% , there are continents and islands that can be considered as obstacles for our remotely-controlled ship. We should have a way to detect whether our next move would hit one of those obstacles. If such a thing happens, the move should be aborted and the ship should stay on the current position and report the obstacle.  Implement surface detection before each move to a new position. If a command encounters a surface, the ship aborts the move, stays on the current position, and reports the obstacle.  The specifications and the implementation of this requirement are very similar to those we did previously, and we'll leave that to you.  Here are a few tips that can be useful:  The Planet object has the constructor that accepts a list of obstacles. Each obstacle is an instance of the Point class. The location.foward and location.backward methods have overloaded versions that accept a list of obstacles. They return true if a move was successful and false if it failed. Use this Boolean to construct a status report required for the Ship.receiveCommands method. The receiveCommands method should return a string with the status of each command. 0 can represent OK and X can be for a failure to move  00X0 = OK, OK, Failure, OK .  The full source for this requirement can be found in the req06-obstacles branch of the tdd-java-ch04-ship repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch04-ship branch req06-obstacles .  [ 111 ]   Unit Testing – Focusing on What You Do and Not on What Has Been Done  Chapter 4  Summary In this chapter, we used TestNG as our testing framework of choice. There wasn't much difference when compared to JUnit, simply because we didn't use any of the more advanced features of TestNG  for example, data providers, factories, and so on . With TDD, it is questionable whether we'll ever have a need for those features.  Visit http:  testng.org , explore it, and decide for yourself which framework best suits your needs.  The main objective of this chapter was to learn how to focus on one unit at a time. We already had a lot of helper classes and we tried our best to ignore their internal workings. In many cases, we did not write specifications that verified that the end result was correct, but we checked whether the method we were working on invoked the correct method from those helper classes. In the real-world, you will be working on projects together with other team members, and it is important to learn how to focus on your tasks and trust that what others do works as expected. The same can be said for third-party libraries. It would be too expensive to test all inner processes that can happen when we invoke them. There are other types of tests that will try to cover those possibilities. When working with unit tests, the focus should only be on the unit we're currently working on.  Now that you have a better grasp of how to use unit tests effectively in the context of TDD, it is time to dive into some other advantages that TDD provides. Specifically, we'll explore how to design our applications better.  [ 112 ]   5  Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."  – Leonardo da Vinci  In the past, the software industry was focused on developing software at high speed, with nothing in mind but cost and time. Quality was a secondary goal, with the false feeling that customers were not interested in it.  Nowadays, with the increasing connectivity of all kinds of platforms and devices, quality has become a first-class citizen in customer's requirements. Good applications offer a good service with a reasonable response-time, without being affected by a multitude of concurrent requests from many users.  Good applications in terms of quality are those that have been well designed. A good design means scalability, security, maintainability, and many other desired attributes.  In this chapter, we will explore how TDD leads developers to good design and best practices by implementing the same application using both the traditional and TDD approaches.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  Why should we care about design? Design considerations and principles The traditional development process The TDD approach using Hamcrest   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  Why should we care about design? In software development, whether you are an expert or a beginner, there are some situations where code seems to be unnatural. You can't avoid the feeling that something is wrong with that code when reading it. Occasionally, you even wonder why the previous programmer implemented a specific method or a class in such a twisted manner. This is because the same functionality can be implemented in a vast number of different ways, each of them unique. With this huge number of possibilities, which is the best one? What defines a good solution? Why is one better than the others? The fact is, all of them are valid so long as the goal is achieved. However, it is true that some aspects should be considered when choosing the right solution. This is where the design of the solution becomes relevant.  Design principles A software design principle is a rule or set of rules that work as a guide for software developers and push them towards smart and maintainable solutions. In other words, design principles are conditions that code must fulfill to be considered objectively well designed.  Most senior developers and experienced programmers know about software design principles and it's very likely that, independently of whether they practice TDD, they are applying them to their daily work. The TDD philosophy encourages programmers—even beginners—to follow some principles and good practices that make code cleaner and more readable. Those practices are enforced by the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.  The Red-Green-Refactor cycle advocates for small feature increments by introducing one test that fails at a time. Programmers add code fragments, as concise and short as possible, so neither the new test or the old ones do not fail anymore. And ultimately, they refactor the code, which consists of cleanup and improvement tasks such as duplication removal or code optimization.  As a result of the process, the code becomes easier to understand and safer to modify in the future. Let's take a look at some of the most popular software design principles.  You Ain't Gonna Need It YAGNI is the acronym for the You Ain't Gonna Need It principle. It aims to erase all unnecessary code and focuses on the current functionalities, not the future ones. The less code you have, the less code you're going to maintain and the lower the probability that bugs will be introduced.  [ 114 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  For more information on YAGNI, visit Martin Fowler's article available at http:  martinfowler.com bliki Yagni.html.  Don't Repeat Yourself The idea behind the Don't Repeat Yourself  DRY  principle is to reuse the code you previously wrote instead of repeating it. The benefits are less code to maintain and the use of code that you know that already works, which is a great thing. It helps you to discover new abstraction levels inside your code.  For additional information, visit http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Don%27t_repeat_yourself.  Keep it simple, stupid This principle has the confusing acronym of keep it simple, stupid  KISS  and states that things perform their function better if they are kept simple rather than complicated. It was coined by Kelly Johnson.  To read about the story behind this principle, visit http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki KISS_principle.  Occam's razor Although Occam's razor is a philosophical principle, not a software engineering one, it is still applicable to what we do. It is very similar to the previous principle, with the main statement being as follows:  "When you have two competing solutions to the same problem, the simpler one is the better."  – William of Ockham  For more information on Occam's razor, visit http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Occam%27s_razor.  [ 115 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  SOLID principles The word SOLID is an acronym invented by Robert C. Martin for the five basic principles of object-oriented programming. By following these five principles, a developer is more likely to create a great, durable, and maintainable application:  Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only a single reason to change. Open-Closed Principle: A class should be open for extension and closed for modification. This is attributed to Bertrand Meyer. Liskov Substitution Principle: This was created by Barbara Liskov, and she says a class should be replaceable by others that extend that class. Interface Segregation Principle: A few specific interfaces are preferable to one general-purpose interface. Dependency Inversion Principle: A class should depend on abstraction instead of implementation. This means that class dependencies must be focused on what is done and forget about how it is done.  For further information on SOLID or other related principles, visit http:  butunclebob.com ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod.  The first four principles are part of the core of TDD thinking, since they aim to simplify the code we write. The last one is focused on classes construction and dependency relationships in the application assembly process.  All of these principles are applicable and desirable in both test and non-test driven development, because, apart from other benefits, they make our code more maintainable. The proper practical application of them is worth a whole book by itself. While we won't have time to go deep into it, we encourage you to investigate further.  In this chapter, we will see how TDD induces developers to put some of these principles into practice effortlessly. We will implement a small but fully functional version of the famous game Connect 4 with both the TDD and non-TDD approaches. Note that repetitive parts, such as Gradle project creation and so on, are omitted, as they are not considered relevant for the purpose of this chapter.  [ 116 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  Connect 4 Connect 4 is a popular, very easy-to-play board game. The rules are limited and simple.  Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven column, six row, vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of your own discs of the same color next to one another vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, before your opponent connects four of theirs.  For further information on the game, visit Wikipedia  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Connect_Four .  Requirements To code the two implementations of Connect 4, the game rules are transcribed as follows in the form of requirements. These requirements are the starting point for both the developments. We will go through the code with some explanations and compare both implementations at the end:  1. 2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7. 8.  The board is composed of seven columns and six rows; all positions are empty. Players introduce discs on the top of the columns. The introduced disc drops down the board if the column is empty. Future discs introduced in the same column will stack over the previous ones. It is a two-person game, so there is one color for each player. One player uses red  R  and the other one uses green  G . Players alternate turns, inserting one disc every time. We want feedback when either an event or an error occurs within the game. The output shows the status of the board after every move. When no more discs can be inserted, the game finishes, and it is considered a draw. If a player inserts a disc and connects more than three discs of his color in a straight vertical line, then that player wins. The same happens in a horizontal line direction. The same happens in a diagonal line direction.  [ 117 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  Test-last implementation of Connect 4 This is the traditional approach, focusing on problem-solving code rather than tests. Some people and companies forget about the value of automated testing and rely on users in what are called user acceptance tests.  This kind of user acceptance test consists of recreating real-world scenarios in a controlled environment, ideally identical to production. Some users perform a lot of different tasks to verify the correctness of the application. If any of these actions fail, then the code is not accepted, as it is breaking some functionality or it is not working as expected.  Moreover, a great number of these companies also use unit testing as a way to perform early regression checks. These unit tests are created after the development process and they try to cover as much code as possible. Last of all, code coverage analysis is executed to get a trace of what is actually covered by those unit tests. These companies follow a single rule of thumb: the bigger the code coverage, the better the quality delivered.  The main problem of this approach is that writing tests afterwards does nothing but demonstrates that the code behaves the way it has been programmed, which is not necessarily the way code is expected to behave. Also, focusing on code coverage leads to bad tests that turn our production code into immutable entities. Every modification we may want to add may cause several tests from different, unrelated parts of the code to fail. That fact means the cost of introducing changes becomes really high and performing any slight modification could end up being a nightmare and very expensive.  To demonstrate some points described earlier, let's implement the Connect 4 game using a TDD and not-TDD approach. The relevant code for each of the identified requirements is presented as we proceed further. This code isn't written incrementally, so some code snippets might contain a few code lines unrelated to the mentioned requirement.   Requirement 1 – the game's board Let us start with the first requirement.  The board is composed of seven horizontal and six vertical empty positions.  [ 118 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  The implementation of this requirement is pretty straightforward. We just need the representation of an empty position and the data structure to hold the game. Note that the  colors used by the players are also defined:  public class Connect4 {   public enum Color {     RED 'R' , GREEN 'G' , EMPTY ' ' ;      private final char value;      Color char value  { this.value = value; }      @Override     public String toString   {       return String.valueOf value ;     }   }    public static final int COLUMNS = 7;    public static final int ROWS = 6;    private Color[][] board = new Color[COLUMNS][ROWS];    public Connect4   {     for  Color[] column : board  {       Arrays.fill column, Color.EMPTY ;     }   } }  Requirement 2 – introducing discs This requirement introduces part of the logic of the game.  Players introduce discs on the top of the columns. The introduced disc drops down the board if the column is empty. Future discs introduced in the same column will stack over the previous ones.  [ 119 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  In this part, board bounds become relevant. We need to mark what positions are already taken, using Color.RED to indicate them. Finally, the first private method is created. It is a helper method that calculates the number of discs introduced in a given column:  public void putDisc int column  {   if  column > 0 && column <= COLUMNS  {     int numOfDiscs = getNumberOfDiscsInColumn column - 1 ;     if  numOfDiscs < ROWS  {       board[column - 1][numOfDiscs] = Color.RED;     }   } }  private int getNumberOfDiscsInColumn int column  {   if  column >= 0 && column < COLUMNS  {     int row;     for  row = 0; row < ROWS; row++  {       if  Color.EMPTY == board[column][row]  {         return row;       }     }     return row;   }   return -1; }  Requirement 3 – player shifts More game logic is introduced with this requirement.  It is a two-person game, so there is one colour for each player. One player uses red  R  and the other one uses green  G . Players alternate turns, inserting one disc every time.  We need to save the current player to determine which player is playing this turn. We also need a function to switch the players to recreate the logic of turns. Some lines of code become relevant in the putDisc function. Specifically, the board position assignment is made using the current player, and it is switched after every move, as the game rules say:  ... private Color currentPlayer = Color.RED;  private void switchPlayer   {  [ 120 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5    if  Color.RED == currentPlayer  {     currentPlayer = Color.GREEN;   } else {     currentPlayer = Color.RED;   } }  public void putDisc int column  {   if  column > 0 && column <= COLUMNS  {     int numOfDiscs = getNumberOfDiscsInColumn column - 1 ;     if  numOfDiscs < ROWS  {       board[column - 1][numOfDiscs] = currentPlayer;       switchPlayer  ;     }   } } ...  Requirement 4 – the game's output A few outputs should be added to let the players know the current status of the game.  We want feedback when either an event or an error occurs within the game. The output shows the status of the board after every move.  No output channel is specified. To make it easier, we decided to use the system standard output to print an event when it occurs. A few lines have been added on every action to let the user know about the status of the game:  ... private static final String DELIMITER = "";  private void switchPlayer   {   if  Color.RED == currentPlayer  {     currentPlayer = Color.GREEN;   } else {     currentPlayer = Color.RED;   }   System.out.println "Current turn: " + currentPlayer ; }  public void printBoard   {   for  int row = ROWS - 1; row >= 0; --row  {  [ 121 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5      StringJoiner stringJoiner =       new StringJoiner DELIMITER, DELIMITER, DELIMITER ;     for  int col = 0; col < COLUMNS; ++col  {       stringJoiner.add board[col][row].toString   ;     }     System.out.println stringJoiner.toString   ;   } }  public void putDisc int column  {   if  column > 0 && column <= COLUMNS  {     int numOfDiscs = getNumberOfDiscsInColumn column - 1 ;     if  numOfDiscs < ROWS  {       board[column - 1][numOfDiscs] = currentPlayer;       printBoard  ;       switchPlayer  ;     } else {       System.out.println numOfDiscs ;       System.out.println "There's no room " +         "for a new disc in this column" ;       printBoard  ;     }   } else {     System.out.println "Column out of bounds" ;     printBoard  ;   } } ...  Requirement 5 – win conditions  I  The first game has a finished condition.  When no more discs can be inserted, the game finishes and it is considered a draw.  The following code shows one of the possible implementations:  ... public boolean isFinished   {   int numOfDiscs = 0;   for  int col = 0; col < COLUMNS; ++col  {     numOfDiscs += getNumberOfDiscsInColumn col ;  [ 122 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5    }   if  numOfDiscs >= COLUMNS * ROWS  {     System.out.println "It's a draw" ;     return true;   }   return false; } ...  Requirement 6 – win condition  II  The first win condition.  If a player inserts a disc and connects more than three discs of his colour in a straight vertical line, then that player wins.  The checkWinCondition private method implements this rule by scanning whether or not the last move is a winning one:  ... private Color winner;  public static final int DISCS_FOR_WIN = 4;  public void putDisc int column  {   ...   if  numOfDiscs < ROWS  {     board[column - 1][numOfDiscs] = currentPlayer;     printBoard  ;     checkWinCondition column - 1, numOfDiscs ;     switchPlayer  ;     ... }  private void checkWinCondition int col, int row  {   Pattern winPattern = Pattern.compile ".*" +     currentPlayer + "{" + DISCS_FOR_WIN + "}.*" ;       Vertical check   StringJoiner stringJoiner = new StringJoiner "" ;   for  int auxRow = 0; auxRow < ROWS; ++auxRow  {     stringJoiner.add board[col][auxRow].toString   ;   }  [ 123 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5    if  winPattern.matcher stringJoiner.toString   .matches    {     winner = currentPlayer;     System.out.println currentPlayer + " wins" ;   } }  public boolean isFinished   {   if  winner != null  return true;   ... } ...  Requirement 7 – win condition  III  This is the same win condition, but in a different direction.  If a player inserts a disc and connects more than three discs of his color in a straight horizontal line, then that player wins.  A few lines to implement this rule are as follows:  ... private void checkWinCondition int col, int row  {   ...      Horizontal check   stringJoiner = new StringJoiner "" ;   for  int column = 0; column < COLUMNS; ++column  {     stringJoiner.add board[column][row].toString   ;   }   if  winPattern.matcher stringJoiner.toString   .matches    {     winner = currentPlayer;     System.out.println currentPlayer + " wins" ;     return;   }   ... } ...  [ 124 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  Requirement 8 – win condition  IV  The last requirement is the last win condition. It is pretty similar to the last two; in this case, in a diagonal direction.  If a player inserts a disc and connects more than three discs of his color in a straight diagonal line, then that player wins.  This is a possible implementation for this last requirement. The code is very similar to the other win conditions because the same statement must be fulfilled:  ... private void checkWinCondition int col, int row  {   ...      Diagonal checks   int startOffset = Math.min col, row ;   int column = col - startOffset, auxRow = row - startOffset;   stringJoiner = new StringJoiner "" ;   do {     stringJoiner.add board[column++][auxRow++].toString   ;   } while  column < COLUMNS && auxRow < ROWS ;    if  winPattern.matcher stringJoiner.toString   .matches    {     winner = currentPlayer;     System.out.println currentPlayer + " wins" ;     return;   }    startOffset = Math.min col, ROWS - 1 - row ;   column = col - startOffset;   auxRow = row + startOffset;   stringJoiner = new StringJoiner "" ;   do {     stringJoiner.add board[column++][auxRow--].toString   ;   } while  column  = 0 ;    if  winPattern.matcher stringJoiner.toString   .matches    {     winner = currentPlayer;     System.out.println currentPlayer + " wins" ;   } } ...  [ 125 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  What we have got is a class with one constructor, three public methods, and three private methods. The logic of the application is distributed among all methods. The biggest flaw here is that this class is very difficult to maintain. The crucial methods, such as checkWinCondition, are non-trivial, with potential for bug entries in future modifications.  If you want to take a look at the full code, you can find it in the https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch05-design.git repository.  We made this small example to demonstrate the common problems with this approach. Topics such as the SOLID principle requires a bigger project to become more illustrative.  In large projects with hundreds of classes, the problems become hours wasted in a sort of surgical development. Developers spend a lot of their time investigating tricky code and understanding how it works, instead of creating new features.  The TDD or test-first implementation At this time, we know how TDD works—writing tests before, implementation after tests, and refactoring later on. We are going to pass through the process and only show the final result for each requirement. It is left to you to figure out the iterative Red-Green-Refactor process. Let's make this more interesting, if possible, by using a Hamcrest framework in our tests.  Hamcrest As described in Chapter 2, Tools, Frameworks, and Environment, Hamcrest improves our test's readability. It makes assertions more semantic and comprehensive when complexity is reduced by using matchers. When a test fails, the error shown becomes more expressive by interpreting the matchers used in the assertion. A message could also be added by the developer.  The Hamcrest library is full of different matchers for different object types and collections. Let's start coding and get a taste of it.  [ 126 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  Requirement 1 – the game's board We will start with the first requirement.  The board is composed of seven horizontal and six vertical empty positions.  There is no big challenge with this requirement. The board bounds are specified, but there's no described behavior in it; just the consideration of an empty board when the game starts. That means zero discs when the game begins. However, this requirement must be taken into account later on.  This is how the test class looks for this requirement. There's a method to initialize the tested class to use a completely fresh object in each test. There's also the first test to verify that there's no disc when we start the game, meaning that all board positions are empty:  public class Connect4TDDSpec {   private Connect4TDD tested;    @Before   public void beforeEachTest   {     tested = new Connect4TDD  ;   }   @Test   public void whenTheGameIsStartedTheBoardIsEmpty   {     assertThat tested.getNumberOfDiscs  , is 0  ;   } }  This is the TDD implementation of the previous specification. Observe the simplicity of the given solution for this first requirement; a simple method returning the result in a single line:  public class Connect4TDD {   public int getNumberOfDiscs   {     return 0;   } }  [ 127 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  Requirement 2 – introducing discs This is the implementation for the second requirement.  Players introduce discs on the top of the columns. An introduced disc drops down the board if the column is empty. Future discs introduced in the same column will stack over the previous ones.  We can split this requirement into the following tests:  When a disc is inserted into an empty column, its position is 0 When a second disc is inserted into the same column, its position is 1 When a disc is inserted into the board, the total number of discs increases When a disc is put outside the boundaries, a Runtime Exception is thrown When a disc is inserted into a column and there's no room available for it, then a Runtime Exception is thrown  Also, these other tests are derived from the first requirement. They are related to the board limits or board behavior.  The Java implementation of the aforementioned tests is as follows:  @Test public void whenDiscOutsideBoardThenRuntimeException   {   int column = -1;   exception.expect RuntimeException.class ;   exception.expectMessage "Invalid column " + column ;   tested.putDiscInColumn column ; }  @Test public void whenFirstDiscInsertedInColumnThenPositionIsZero   {   int column = 1;   assertThat tested.putDiscInColumn column ,  is 0  ; }  @Test public void whenSecondDiscInsertedInColumnThenPositionIsOne   {   int column = 1;   tested.putDiscInColumn column ;   assertThat tested.putDiscInColumn column , is 1  ; }  [ 128 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  @Test public void whenDiscInsertedThenNumberOfDiscsIncreases   {   int column = 1;   tested.putDiscInColumn column ;   assertThat tested.getNumberOfDiscs  , is 1  ; }  @Test public void whenNoMoreRoomInColumnThenRuntimeException   {   int column = 1;   int maxDiscsInColumn = 6;    the number of rows   for  int times = 0; times < maxDiscsInColumn; ++times  {     tested.putDiscInColumn column ;   }   exception.expect RuntimeException.class ;   exception.expectMessage "No more room in column " + column ;   tested.putDiscInColumn column ; }  This is the necessary code to satisfy the tests:  private static final int ROWS = 6;  private static final int COLUMNS = 7;  private static final String EMPTY = " ";  private String[][] board = new String[ROWS][COLUMNS];  public Connect4TDD   {   for  String[] row : board  Arrays.fill row, EMPTY ; }  public int getNumberOfDiscs   {   return IntStream            .range 0, COLUMNS             .map this::getNumberOfDiscsInColumn             .sum  ; }  private int getNumberOfDiscsInColumn int column  {   return  int  IntStream                  .range 0, ROWS                   .filter row -> !EMPTY.equals board[row][column]                    .count  ; }  public int putDiscInColumn int column  {  [ 129 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5    checkColumn column ;   int row = getNumberOfDiscsInColumn column ;   checkPositionToInsert row, column ;   board[row][column] = "X";   return row; }  private void checkColumn int column  {   if  column  = COLUMNS      throw new RuntimeException "Invalid column " + column ; }  private void checkPositionToInsert int row, int column  {   if  row == ROWS      throw new RuntimeException "No more room in column " + column ; }  Requirement 3 – player shifts The third requirement relates to the game logic.  It is a two-person game, so there is one colour for each player. One player uses red  R  and the other one uses green  G . Players alternate turns, inserting one disc every time.  These tests cover the verification of the new functionality. For the sake of simplicity, the red player will always start the game:  @Test public void whenFirstPlayerPlaysThenDiscColorIsRed   {   assertThat tested.getCurrentPlayer  , is "R"  ; }  @Test public void whenSecondPlayerPlaysThenDiscColorIsRed   {   int column = 1;   tested.putDiscInColumn column ;   assertThat tested.getCurrentPlayer  , is "G"  ; }  [ 130 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  A couple of methods need to be created to cover this functionality. The switchPlayer method is called before returning the row in the putDiscInColumn method:  private static final String RED = "R";  private static final String GREEN = "G";  private String currentPlayer = RED;  public Connect4TDD   {   for  String[] row : board  Arrays.fill row, EMPTY ; }  public String getCurrentPlayer   {   return currentPlayer; }  private void switchPlayer   {   if  RED.equals currentPlayer   currentPlayer = GREEN;   else currentPlayer = RED; }  public int putDiscInColumn int column  {   ...   switchPlayer  ;   return row; }  Requirement 4 – the game's output Next, we should let the player know the status of the game.  We want feedback when either an event or an error occurs within the game. The output shows the status of the board on every move.  As we are throwing exceptions when an error occurs, this is already covered, so we only need to implement these two tests. Furthermore, for the sake of testability, we need to introduce a parameter within the constructor. By introducing this parameter, the output becomes easier to test:  private OutputStream output;  @Before  [ 131 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  public void beforeEachTest   {   output = new ByteArrayOutputStream  ;   tested = new Connect4TDD new PrintStream output  ; }  @Test public void whenAskedForCurrentPlayerTheOutputNotice   {   tested.getCurrentPlayer  ;   assertThat output.toString  , containsString "Player R turn"  ; }  @Test public void whenADiscIsIntroducedTheBoardIsPrinted   {   int column = 1;   tested.putDiscInColumn column ;   assertThat output.toString  , containsString " R     "  ; }  One possible implementation is to pass the preceding tests. As you can see, the class constructor now has one parameter. This parameter is used in several methods to print the event or action description:  private static final String DELIMITER = "";  public Connect4TDD PrintStream out  {   outputChannel = out;   for  String[] row : board  Arrays.fill row, EMPTY ; }  public String getCurrentPlayer   {   outputChannel.printf "Player %s turn%n", currentPlayer ;   return currentPlayer; }  private void printBoard   {   for  int row = ROWS - 1; row >= 0; row--  {     StringJoiner stringJoiner = new StringJoiner DELIMITER, DELIMITER, DELIMITER ;     Stream.of board[row] .forEachOrdered stringJoiner::add ;     outputChannel.println stringJoiner.toString   ;   } }  public int putDiscInColumn int column  {   ...   printBoard  ;   switchPlayer  ;  [ 132 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5    return row; }  Requirement 5 – win condition  I  This requirement tells the system whether the game is finished.  When no more discs can be inserted, the game finishes and it is considered a draw.  There are two conditions to test. The first condition is that new game must be unfinished; the second condition is that full board games must be finished:  @Test public void whenTheGameStartsItIsNotFinished   {   assertFalse "The game must not be finished", tested.isFinished   ; }  @Test public void whenNoDiscCanBeIntroducedTheGamesIsFinished   {   for  int row = 0; row < 6; row++      for  int column = 0; column < 7; column++        tested.putDiscInColumn column ;     assertTrue "The game must be finished", tested.isFinished   ; }  An easy and simple solution to these two tests is as follows:  public boolean isFinished   {   return getNumberOfDiscs   == ROWS * COLUMNS; }  Requirement 6 – win condition  II  This is the first win condition requirement for players.  If a player inserts a disc and connects more than three discs of his color in a straight vertical line, then that player wins.  [ 133 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  In fact, this requires one single check. If the current inserted disc connects other three discs in a vertical line, the current player wins the game:  @Test public void when4VerticalDiscsAreConnectedThenPlayerWins   {   for  int row = 0; row < 3; row++  {     tested.putDiscInColumn 1 ;    R     tested.putDiscInColumn 2 ;    G   }   assertThat tested.getWinner  , isEmptyString   ;   tested.putDiscInColumn 1 ;    R   assertThat tested.getWinner  , is "R"  ; }  There are a couple of changes to the putDiscInColumn method. Also, a new method called checkWinner has been created:  private static final int DISCS_TO_WIN = 4;  private String winner = "";  private void checkWinner int row, int column  {   if  winner.isEmpty    {     String colour = board[row][column];     Pattern winPattern =       Pattern.compile ".*" + colour + "{" +            DISCS_TO_WIN + "}.*" ;      String vertical = IntStream                        .range 0, ROWS                         .mapToObj r -> board[r][column]                         .reduce String::concat .get  ;     if  winPattern.matcher vertical .matches          winner = colour;   } }  Requirement 7 – win condition  III  This is the second win condition, which is pretty similar to the previous one.  If a player inserts a disc and connects more than three discs of his color in a straight horizontal line, then that player wins.  [ 134 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  This time, we are trying to win the game by inserting discs into adjacent columns:  @Test public void when4HorizontalDiscsAreConnectedThenPlayerWins   {   int column;   for  column = 0; column < 3; column++  {     tested.putDiscInColumn column ;    R     tested.putDiscInColumn column ;    G   }   assertThat tested.getWinner  , isEmptyString   ;   tested.putDiscInColumn column ;    R   assertThat tested.getWinner  , is "R"  ; }  The code to pass this test is put into the checkWinners method:    if  winner.isEmpty    {     String horizontal = Stream                          .of board[row]                           .reduce String::concat .get  ;     if  winPattern.matcher horizontal .matches          winner = colour;   }  Requirement 8 – win condition  IV  The last requirement is the last win condition.  If a player inserts a disc and connects more than three discs of his color in a straight diagonal line, then that player wins.  We need to perform valid game movements to achieve the condition. In this case, we need to test both diagonals across the board: from top-right to bottom-left and from bottom-right to top-left. The following tests use a list of columns to recreate a full game to reproduce the scenario under test:  @Test public void when4Diagonal1DiscsAreConnectedThenThatPlayerWins   {   int[] gameplay = new int[] {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4};   for  int column : gameplay  {     tested.putDiscInColumn column ;   }   assertThat tested.getWinner  , is "R"  ;  [ 135 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  }  @Test public void when4Diagonal2DiscsAreConnectedThenThatPlayerWins   {   int[] gameplay = new int[] {3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1};   for  int column : gameplay  {     tested.putDiscInColumn column ;   }   assertThat tested.getWinner  , is "G"  ; }  Again, the checkWinner method needs to be modified, adding new board verifications:      if  winner.isEmpty    {       int startOffset = Math.min column, row ;       int myColumn = column - startOffset,         myRow = row - startOffset;       StringJoiner stringJoiner = new StringJoiner "" ;       do {         stringJoiner .add board[myRow++][myColumn++] ;       } while  myColumn < COLUMNS && myRow < ROWS ;       if  winPattern .matcher stringJoiner.toString   .matches            winner = currentPlayer;     }      if  winner.isEmpty    {       int startOffset = Math.min column, ROWS - 1 - row ;       int myColumn = column - startOffset,         myRow = row + startOffset;       StringJoiner stringJoiner = new StringJoiner "" ;       do {         stringJoiner.add board[myRow--][myColumn++] ;       } while  myColumn  = 0 ;       if  winPattern.matcher stringJoiner.toString   .matches            winner = currentPlayer;     }  Final considerations Using TDD, we got a class with a constructor, five public methods, and six private methods. In general, all methods look pretty simple and easy to understand. In this approach, we also got a big method to check winner conditions: checkWinner. The advantage is that with this approach we got a bunch of useful tests to guarantee that future modifications do not alter the behavior of the method accidentally, allowing for the introduction of new changes painlessly. Code coverage wasn't the goal, but we got a really high percentage.  [ 136 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  Additionally, for testing purposes, we refactored the constructor of the class to accept the output channel as a parameter  dependency injection . If we need to modify the way the game status is printed, it will be easier that way than replacing all the uses in the traditional approach. Hence, it is more extensible. In the test-last approach, we have been abusing the System.println method and it will be really tedious task if we decide to change all the occurrences for any other thing.  In large projects, when you detect that a great number of tests must be created for a single class, this enables you to split the class following the Single Responsibility Principle. As the output printing was delegated to an external class passed in a parameter in initialization, a more elegant solution would be to create a class with high-level printing methods. That would keep the printing logic separated from the game logic. Like the huge code coverage shown in the following image, these are a few examples of the benefits of good design using TDD:  The code of this approach is available at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch05-design.git.  Summary In this chapter, we briefly talked about software design and a few basic design principles. We implemented a fully functional version of the board game Connect 4 using two approaches—traditional and TDD.  [ 137 ]   Design – If It's Not Testable, It's Not Designed Well  Chapter 5  We analyzed both solutions in terms of pros and cons, and used a Hamcrest framework to empower our tests.  Finally, we concluded that good design and good practices can be performed by both approaches, but TDD is a better approach.  For further information about the topics that this chapter covers, refer to two highly recommended books written by Robert C. Martin: Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship and Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices.  [ 138 ]   6  – Linus Torvalds  Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."  TDD is about speed. We want to quickly demonstrate whether an idea, concept, or implementation is valid or not. Further on, we want to run all tests quickly. A major bottleneck to this speed is external dependencies. Setting up the DB data required by tests can be time-consuming. The execution of tests that verify code that uses third-party APIs can be slow. Most importantly, writing tests that satisfy all external dependencies can become too complicated to be worthwhile. Mocking both external and internal dependencies helps us solve these problems.  We'll build on what we did in Chapter 3, Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection. We'll extend Tic-Tac-Toe to use MongoDB as data storage. None of our unit tests will actually use MongoDB since all communications will be mocked. At the end, we'll create an integration test that will verify that our code and MongoDB are indeed integrated.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  Mocking Mockito Tic-Tac-Toe v2 requirements Developing Tic-Tac-Toe v2 Integration tests   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Mocking Everyone who has done any of the applications more complicated than Hello World knows that Java code is full of dependencies. There can be classes and methods written by other members of the team, third-party libraries, or external systems that we communicate with. Even libraries found inside JDK are dependencies. We might have a business layer that communicates with the data access layer which, in turn, uses database drivers to fetch data. When working with unit tests, we take dependencies even further and often consider all public and protected methods  even those inside the class we are working on  as dependencies that should be isolated.  When doing TDD on the unit tests level, creating specifications that contemplate all those dependencies can be so complex that the tests themselves would become bottlenecks. Their development time can increase so much that the benefits gained with TDD quickly become overshadowed by the ever-increasing cost. More importantly, those same dependencies tend to create such complex tests that they contain more bugs than the implementation itself.  The idea of unit testing  especially when tied to TDD  is to write specifications that validate whether the code of a single unit works regardless of dependencies. When dependencies are internal, they are already tested, and we know that they do what we expect them to do. On the other hand, external dependencies require trust. We must believe that they work correctly. Even if we don't, the task of performing deep testing of, let's say, the JDK java.nio classes is too big for most of us. Besides, those potential problems will surface when we run functional and integration tests.  While focused on units, we must try to remove all dependencies that a unit may use. Removal of those dependencies is accomplished through a combination of design and mocking.  The benefits of using mocks include reduced code dependency and faster text execution.  Mocks are prerequisites for the fast execution of tests and the ability to concentrate on a single unit of functionality. By mocking dependencies external to the method that is being tested, the developer is able to focus on the task at hand without spending time setting them up. In a case of bigger or multiple teams working together, those dependencies may not even be developed. Also, the execution of tests without mocks tends to be slow. Good candidates for mocks are databases, other products, services, and so on.  [ 140 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Before we go deeper into mocks, let us go through reasons why one would employ them in the first place.  Why mocks? The following list represents some of the reasons why we employ mock objects:  The object generates nondeterministic results. For example, java.util.Date   provides a different result every time we instantiate it. We cannot test that its result is as expected:  java.util.Date date = new java.util.Date  ; date.getTime  ;    What is the result this method returns?  The object does not yet exist. For example, we might create an interface and test against it. The object that implements that interface might not have been written at the time we test code that uses that interface. The object is slow and requires time to process. The most common example would be databases. We might have a code that retrieves all records and generates a report. This operation can last minutes, hours, or, in some cases, even days.  The preceding reasons in the support of mock objects apply to any type of testing. However, in the case of unit tests and, especially, in the context of TDD, there is one more reason, perhaps more important than others. Mocking allows us to isolate all dependencies used by the method we are currently working on. This empowers us to concentrate on a single unit and ignore the inner workings of the code that the unit invokes.  Terminology Terminology can be a bit confusing, especially since different people use different names for the same thing. To make things even more complicated, mocking frameworks tend not to be consistent when naming their methods.  Before we proceed, let us briefly go through terminology.  [ 141 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Test doubles is a generic name for all of the following types:  Dummy object's purpose is to act as a substitute for a real method argument Test stub can be used to replace a real object with a test-specific object that feeds the desired indirect inputs into the system under test Test Spy captures the indirect output calls made to another component by the System Under Test  SUT  for later verification by the test Mock object replaces an object the SUT depends on, with a test-specific object that verifies that it is being used correctly by the SUT Fake object replaces a component that the SUT depends on with a much lighter- weight implementation  If you are confused, it may help you to know that you are not the only one. Things are even more complicated than this, since there is no clear agreement, nor a naming standard, between frameworks or authors. Terminology is confusing and inconsistent, and the terms mentioned earlier are by no means accepted by everyone.  To simplify things, throughout this book we'll use the same naming used by Mockito  our framework of choice . This way, methods that you'll be using will correspond with the terminology that you'll be reading further on. We'll continue using mocking as a general term for what others might call test doubles. Furthermore, we'll use a mock or spy term to refer to Mockito methods.  Mock objects Mock objects simulate the behavior of real  often complex  objects. They allow us to create an object that will replace the real one used in the implementation code. A mocked object will expect a defined method with defined arguments to return the expected result. It knows in advance what is supposed to happen and how we expect it to react.  Let's take a look at one simple example:  TicTacToeCollection collection = mock TicTacToeCollection.class ; assertThat collection.drop   .isFalse  ; doReturn true .when collection .drop  ;  assertThat collection.drop   .isTrue  ;  [ 142 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  First, we defined collection to be a mock of TicTacToeCollection. At this moment, all methods from this mocked object are fake and, in the case of Mockito, return default values. This is confirmed in the second line, where we assert that the drop method returns false. Further on, we specify that our mocked object collection should return true when the drop method is invoked. Finally, we assert that the drop method returns true.  We created a mock object that returns default values and, for one of its methods, defined what should be the return value. At no point was a real object used.  Later on, we'll work with spies that have this logic inverted; an object uses real methods unless specified otherwise. We'll see and learn more about mocking soon when we start extending our Tic-Tac-Toe application. Right now, we'll take a look at one of the Java mocking frameworks called Mockito.  Mockito Mockito is a mocking framework with a clean and simple API. Tests produced with Mockito are readable, easy to write, and intuitive. It contains three major static methods:  mock  : This is used to create mocks. Optionally, we can specify how those mocks behave with when   and given  . spy  : This can be used for partial mocking. Spied objects invoke real methods unless we specify otherwise. As with mock  , behavior can be set for every public or protected method  excluding static . The major difference is that mock   creates a fake of the whole object, while spy   uses the real object. verify  : This is used to check whether methods were called with given arguments. It is a form of assert.  We'll go deeper into Mockito once we start coding our Tic-Tac-Toe v2 application. First, however, let us quickly go through a new set of requirements.  Tic-Tac-Toe v2 requirements The requirements of our Tic-Tac-Toe v2 application are simple. We should add a persistent storage so that players can continue playing the game at some later time. We'll use MongoDB for this purpose.  [ 143 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Add MongoDB persistent storage to the application.  Developing Tic-Tac-Toe v2 We'll continue where we left off with Tic-Tac-Toe in Chapter 3, Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection. The complete source code of the application developed so far can be found at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch06-tic-tac-toe-mongo.git. Use the VCSCheckout from Version ControlGit option from the IntelliJ IDEA to clone the code. As with any other project, the first thing we need to do is add the dependencies to build.gradle:  dependencies {     compile 'org.jongo:jongo:1.1'     compile 'org.mongodb:mongo-java-driver:2.+'     testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'     testCompile 'org.mockito:mockito-all:1.+' }  Importing the MongoDB driver should be self-explanatory. Jongo is a very helpful set of utility methods that make working with Java code much more similar to the Mongo query language. For the testing part, we'll continue using JUnit with the addition of Mockito mocks, spies, and validations.  You'll notice that we won't install MongoDB until the very end. With Mockito, we will not need it, since all our Mongo dependencies will be mocked.  Once dependencies are specified, remember to refresh them in the IDEA Gradle Projects dialogue.  The source code can be found in the 00-prerequisites branch of the tdd-java-ch06- tic-tac-toe-mongo Git repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch06-tic-tac-toe-mongo branch 00-prereq uisites .  Now that we have prerequisites set, let's start working on the first requirement.  [ 144 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Requirement 1 – store moves We should be able to save each move to the DB. Since we already have all the game logic implemented, this should be trivial to do. Nonetheless, this will be a very good example of mock usage.  Implement an option to save a single move with the turn number, the x and y axis positions, and the player  X or O .  We should start by defining the Java bean that will represent our data storage schema. There's nothing special about it, so we'll skip this part with only one note.  Do not spend too much time defining specifications for Java boilerplate code. Our implementation of the bean contains overwritten equals and hashCode. Both are generated automatically by IDEA and do not provide a real value, except to satisfy the need to compare two objects of the same type  we'll use that comparison later on in specifications . TDD is supposed to help us design better and write better code. Writing 15-20 specifications to define boilerplate code that could be written automatically by IDE  as is the case with the equals method  does not help us meet these objectives. Mastering TDD means not only learning how to write specifications, but also knowing when it's not worth it.  That being said, consult the source code to see the bean specification and implementation in it's entirety.  The source code can be found in the 01-bean branch of the tdd-java-ch06-tic-tac- toe-mongo Git repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch06-tic-tac-toe-mongo branch 01-bean . The particular classes are TicTacToeBeanSpec and TicTacToeBean.  Now, let's go to a more interesting part  but still without mocks, spies, and validations . Let's write specifications related to saving data to MongoDB.  For this requirement, we'll create two new classes inside the com.packtpublishing.tddjava.ch03tictactoe.mongo package:  TicTacToeCollectionSpec  inside src test java  TicTacToeCollection  inside src main java   [ 145 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Specification – DB name We should specify what the name of the DB that we'll use will be:  @Test public void whenInstantiatedThenMongoHasDbNameTicTacToe   {   TicTacToeCollection collection = new TicTacToeCollection  ;   assertEquals       "tic-tac-toe", collection.getMongoCollection  .getDBCollection  .getDB  .getName    ; }  We are instantiating a new TicTacToeCollection class and verifying that the DB name is what we expect.  Implementation The implementation is very straightforward, as follows:  private MongoCollection mongoCollection; protected MongoCollection getMongoCollection   {   return mongoCollection; } public TicTacToeCollection   throws UnknownHostException {   DB db = new MongoClient  .getDB "tic-tac-toe" ;   mongoCollection = new Jongo db .getCollection "bla" ; }  When instantiating the TicTacToeCollection class, we're creating a new MongoCollection with the specified DB name  tic-tac-toe  and assigning it to the local variable.  Bear with us. There's only one more specification left until we get to the interesting part where we'll use mocks and spies.  [ 146 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Specification – a name for the Mongo collection In the previous implementation, we used bla as the name of the collection because Jongo forced us to put some string. Let's create a specification that will define the name of the Mongo collection that we'll use:  @Test public void whenInstantiatedThenMongoCollectionHasNameGame   {   TicTacToeCollection collection = new TicTacToeCollection  ;   assertEquals              "game",             collection.getMongoCollection  .getName   ; }  This specification is almost identical to the previous one and probably self explanatory.  Implementation All we have to do to implement this specification is change the string we used to set the collection name:  public TicTacToeCollection   throws UnknownHostException {   DB db = new MongoClient  .getDB "tic-tac-toe" ;   mongoCollection = new Jongo db .getCollection "game" ; }  Refactoring You might have got the impression that refactoring is reserved only for the implementation code. However, when we look the objectives behind refactoring  more readable, optimal, and faster code , they apply as much to specifications as to the implementation code.  The last two specifications have the instantiation of the TicTacToeCollection class repeated. We can move it to a method annotated with @Before. The effect will be the same  the class will be instantiated before each method annotated with @Test is run  and we'll remove the duplicated code. Since the same instantiation will be needed in further specs, removing duplication now will provide even more benefits later on. At the same time, we'll save ourselves from throwing UnknownHostException over and over again:  TicTacToeCollection collection;  @Before public void before   throws UnknownHostException {  [ 147 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6    collection = new TicTacToeCollection  ; } @Test public void whenInstantiatedThenMongoHasDbNameTicTacToe   {           throws UnknownHostException {     TicTacToeCollection collection = new TicTacToeCollection  ;   assertEquals      "tic-tac-toe", collection.getMongoCollection  .getDBCollection  .getDB  .getName    ; }  @Test public void whenInstantiatedThenMongoHasNameGame   {           throws UnknownHostException {     TicTacToeCollection collection = new TicTacToeCollection  ;   assertEquals      "game",     collection.getMongoCollection  .getName   ; }  Use setup and teardown methods. The benefits of these allow preparation or setup and disposal or teardown code to be executed before and after the class or each test method.   In many cases, some code needs to be executed before the test class or each method in a class. For this purpose, JUnit has the @BeforeClass and @Before annotations that should be used in the setup phase. The @BeforeClass executes the associated method before the class is loaded  before the first test method is run . @Before executes the associated method before each test is run. Both should be used when there are certain preconditions required by tests. The most common example is setting up test data in the  hopefully in-memory  database. On the opposite end are the @After and @AfterClass annotations, which should be used as the teardown phase. Their main purpose is to destroy the data or state created during the setup phase or by tests themselves. Each test should be independent from others. Moreover, no test should be affected by the others. The teardown phase helps maintain the system as if no test were previously executed.  Now let's do some mocking, spying, and verifying!  [ 148 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Specification – adding items to the Mongo collection We should create a method that saves data to MongoDB. After studying Jongo documentation, we discovered that there is the MongoCollection.save method, which does exactly that. It accepts any object as a method argument and transforms it  using Jackson  into JSON, which is natively used in MongoDB. The point is that after playing around with Jongo, we decided to use and, more importantly, trust this library.  We can write Mongo specifications in two ways. One more traditional and appropriate for End2End  E2E  or integration tests would be to bring up a MongoDB instance, invoke the Jongo's save method, query the database, and confirm that data has indeed been saved. It does not end here, as we would need to clean up the database before each test to always guarantee that the same state is unpolluted by the execution of previous tests. Finally, once all tests are finished executing, we might want to stop the MongoDB instance and free server resources for some other tasks.  As you might have guessed, there is quite a lot of work involved for a single test written in this way. Also, it's not only about work that needs to be invested into writing such tests. The execution time would be increased quite a lot. Running one test that communicates with a DB does not take long. Running ten tests is usually still fast. Running hundreds or thousands can take quite a lot of time. What happens when it takes a lot of time to run all unit tests? People lose patience and start dividing them into groups or give up on TDD all together. Dividing tests into groups means that we lose confidence in the fact that nothing got broken, since we are continuously testing only parts of it. Giving up on TDD... Well, that's not the objective we're trying to accomplish. However, if it takes a lot of time to run tests, it's reasonable to expect developers to not want to wait until they are finished running before they move to the next specification, and that is the point when we stop doing TDD. What is a reasonable amount of time to allow our unit tests to run? There is no one-fits-all rule that defines this; however, as a rule of thumb, if the time is longer than 10-15 seconds, we should start worrying, and dedicate time to optimizing them.  Tests should run quickly. The benefits are that the tests are used often.  If it takes a lot of time to run tests, developers will stop using them or run only a small subset related to the changes they are making. One benefit of fast tests, besides fostering their usage, is fast feedback. The sooner the problem is detected, the easier it is to fix it. Knowledge about the code that produced the problem is still fresh. If a developer has already started working on the next feature while waiting for the completion of the execution of tests, they might decide to postpone fixing the problem until that new feature is developed. On the other hand, if they drops their current work to fix the bug, time is lost in context switching.  [ 149 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  If using live DB to run unit tests is not a good option, then what is the alternative? Mocking and spying! In our example, we know which method of a third-party library should be invoked. We also invested enough time to trust this library  besides integration tests that will be performed later on . Once we know how to use the library, we can limit our job to verifying that correct invocations of that library have been made.  Let us give it a try.  First, we should modify our existing code and convert our instantiation of the TicTacToeCollection into a spy:  import static org.mockito.Mockito.*; ... @Before public void before   throws UnknownHostException {   collection = spy new TicTacToeCollection   ; }  Spying on a class is called partial mocking. When applied, the class will behave exactly the same as it would if it was instantiated normally. The major difference is that we can apply partial mocking and substitute one or more methods with mocks. As a general rule, we tend to use spies mostly on classes that we're working on. We want to retain all the functionality of a class that we're writing specifications for, but with an additional option to, when needed, mock a part of it.  Now let us write the specification itself. It could be the following:  @Test public void whenSaveMoveThenInvokeMongoCollectionSave   {   TicTacToeBean bean = new TicTacToeBean 3, 2, 1, 'Y' ;   MongoCollection mongoCollection = mock MongoCollection.class ;   doReturn mongoCollection .when collection .getMongoCollection  ;   collection.saveMove bean ;    verify mongoCollection, times 1  .save bean ; }  Static methods, such as mock, doReturn, and verify, are all from the org.mockito.Mockito class.  [ 150 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  First, we're creating a new TicTacToeBean. There's nothing special there. Next, we are creating a mock object out of the MongoCollection. Since we already established that, when working on a unit level, we want to avoid direct communication with the DB, mocking this dependency will provide this for us. It will convert a real  class into a mocked one. For the class using mongoCollection, it'll look like a real one; however, behind the scenes, all its methods are shallow and do not actually do anything. It's like overwriting that class and replacing all the methods with empty ones:  MongoCollection mongoCollection = mock MongoCollection.class ;  Next, we're telling that a mocked mongoCollection should be returned whenever we call the getMongoCollection method of the collection spied class. In other words, we're telling our class to use a fake collection instead of the real one:  doReturn mongoCollection .when collection .getMongoCollection  ;  Then, we're calling the method that we are working on:  collection.saveMove bean ;  Finally, we should verify that the correct invocation of the Jongo library is performed once:  verify mongoCollection, times 1  .save bean ;  Let's try to implement this specification.  Implementation To better understand the specification we just wrote, let us do only a partial implementation. We'll create an empty method, saveMove. This will allow our code to compile without implementing the specification yet:  public void saveMove TicTacToeBean bean  { }  When we run our specifications  gradle test , the result is the following:  Wanted but not invoked: mongoCollection.save Turn: 3; X: 2; Y: 1; Player: Y ;  [ 151 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Mockito tells us that, according to our specification, we expect the mongoCollection.save method to be invoked, and that the expectation was not fulfilled. Since the test is still failing, we need to go back and finish the implementation. One of the biggest sins in TDD is to have a failing test and move onto something else.  All tests should pass before a new test is written. The benefits of this are that the focus is maintained on a small unit of work, and implementation code is  almost  always in a working condition.  It is sometimes tempting to write multiple tests before the actual implementation. In other cases, developers ignore problems detected by the existing tests and move towards new features. This should be avoided whenever possible. In most cases, breaking this rule will only introduce technical debt that will need to be paid with interest. One of the goals of TDD is ensuring that the implementation code is  almost  always working as expected. Some projects, due to pressures to reach the delivery date or maintain the budget, break this rule and dedicate time to new features, leaving the fixing of the code associated with failed tests for later. Those projects usually end up postponing the inevitable.  Let's modify the implementation too, for example, the following:  public void saveMove TicTacToeBean bean  {   getMongoCollection  .save null ; }  If we run our specifications again, the result is the following:  Argument s  are different! Wanted: mongoCollection.save Turn: 3; X: 2; Y: 1; Player: Y ;  This time we are invoking the expected method, but the arguments we are passing to it are not what we hoped for. In the specification, we set the expectation to a bean  new TicTacToeBean 3, 2, 1, 'Y'   and in the implementation, we passed null. Not only that, Mockito verifications can tell us whether a correct method was invoked, and also whether the arguments passed to that method are correct.  The correct implementation of the specification is the following:  public void saveMove TicTacToeBean bean  {   getMongoCollection  .save bean ; }  This time all specifications should pass, and we can, happily, proceed to the next one.  [ 152 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Specification – adding operation feedback Let us change the return type of our saveMove method to boolean:  @Test public void whenSaveMoveThenReturnTrue   {   TicTacToeBean bean = new TicTacToeBean 3, 2, 1, 'Y' ;   MongoCollection mongoCollection = mock MongoCollection.class ;   doReturn mongoCollection .when collection .getMongoCollection  ;   assertTrue collection.saveMove bean  ; }  Implementation This implementation is very straightforward. We should change the method return type. Remember that one of the rules of TDD is to use the simplest possible solution. The simplest solution is to return true as in the following example:  public boolean saveMove TicTacToeBean bean  {   getMongoCollection  .save bean ;   return true; }  Refactoring You have probably noticed that the last two specifications have the first two lines duplicated. We can refactor the specifications code by moving them to the method annotated with @Before:  TicTacToeCollection collection; TicTacToeBean bean; MongoCollection mongoCollection;  @Before public void before   throws UnknownHostException {   collection = spy new TicTacToeCollection   ;   bean = new TicTacToeBean 3, 2, 1, 'Y' ;   mongoCollection = mock MongoCollection.class ; } ... @Test public void whenSaveMoveThenInvokeMongoCollectionSave   {    TicTacToeBean bean = new TicTacToeBean 3, 2, 1, 'Y' ;    MongoCollection mongoCollection = mock MongoCollection.class ;  [ 153 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6    doReturn mongoCollection .when collection .getMongoCollection  ;   collection.saveMove bean ;   verify mongoCollection, times 1  .save bean ; }  @Test public void whenSaveMoveThenReturnTrue   {    TicTacToeBean bean = new TicTacToeBean 3, 2, 1, 'Y' ;    MongoCollection mongoCollection = mock MongoCollection.class ;    doReturn mongoCollection .when collection .getMongoCollection  ;    assertTrue collection.saveMove bean  ; }  Specification – error handling Now let us contemplate the option that something might go wrong when using MongoDB. When, for example, an exception is thrown, we might want to return false from our saveMove method:  @Test public void givenExceptionWhenSaveMoveThenReturnFalse   {   doThrow new MongoException "Bla"       .when mongoCollection .save any TicTacToeBean.class  ;   doReturn mongoCollection .when collection .getMongoCollection  ;   assertFalse collection.saveMove bean  ; }  Here, we introduce to another Mockito method: doThrow. It acts in a similar way to doReturn and throws an Exception when set conditions are fulfilled. The specification will throw the MongoException when the save method inside the mongoCollection class is invoked. This allows us to assert that our saveMove method returns false when an exception is thrown.  [ 154 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Implementation The implementation can be as simple as adding a try catch block:  public boolean saveMove TicTacToeBean bean  {   try {     getMongoCollection  .save bean ;     return true;   } catch  Exception e  {     return false;   } }  Specification – clear state between games This is a very simple application that, at least at this moment, can store only one game session. Whenever a new instance is created, we should start over and remove all data stored in the database. The easiest way to do this is to simply drop the MongoDB collection. Jongo has the MongoCollection.drop   method that can be used for that. We'll create a new method, drop, that will act in a similar way to saveMove.  If you haven't worked with Mockito, MongoDB, and or Jongo, the chances are you were not able to do the exercises from this chapter by yourself, and just decided to follow the solutions we provided. If that's the case, this is the moment when you may want to switch gears and try to write the specifications and implementation by yourself.  We should verify that MongoCollection.drop   is invoked from our own method drop   inside the TicTacToeCollection class. Try it by yourself before looking at the following code. It should be almost the same as what we did with the save method:  @Test public void whenDropThenInvokeMongoCollectionDrop   {   doReturn mongoCollection .when collection .getMongoCollection  ;   collection.drop  ;   verify mongoCollection .drop  ; }  [ 155 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Implementation Since this is a wrapper method, implementing this specification should be fairly easy:  public void drop   {   getMongoCollection  .drop  ; }  Specification – drop operation feedback We're almost done with this class. There are only two specifications left.  Let us make sure that, in normal circumstances, we return true:  @Test public void whenDropThenReturnTrue   {   doReturn mongoCollection .when collection .getMongoCollection  ;   assertTrue collection.drop   ; }  Implementation If things look too easy with TDD, then that is on purpose. We are splitting tasks into such small entities that, in most cases, implementing a specification is a piece of cake. This one is no exception:  public boolean drop   {   getMongoCollection  .drop  ;   return true; }  Specification – error handling Finally, let us make sure that the drop method returns false in case of an Exception:  @Test public void givenExceptionWhenDropThenReturnFalse   {   doThrow new MongoException "Bla"  .when mongoCollection .drop  ;   doReturn mongoCollection .when collection .getMongoCollection  ;   assertFalse collection.drop   ; }  [ 156 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Implementation Let us just add a try catch block:  public boolean drop   {   try {     getMongoCollection  .drop  ;     return true;   } catch  Exception e  {     return false;   } }  With this implementation, we are finished with the TicTacToeCollection class that acts as a layer between our main class and MongoDB.  The source code can be found in the 02-save-move branch of the tdd-java-ch06-tic- tac-toe-mongo Git repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch06-tic-tac-toe-mongo branch 02-save-m ove . The classes in particular are TicTacToeCollectionSpec and TicTacToeCollection.  Requirement 2 – store every turn Let us employ the TicTacToeCollection methods inside our main class TicTacToe. Whenever a player plays a turn successfully, we should save it to the DB. Also, we should drop the collection whenever a new class is instantiated so that a new game does not overlap the old one. We could make it much more elaborate than this; however, for the purpose of this chapter and learning how to use mocking, this requirement should do for now.  Save each turn to the database and make sure that a new session cleans the old data.  Let's do some setup first.  [ 157 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Specification – creating new collection Since all our methods that will be used to communicate with MongoDB are in the TicTacToeCollection class, we should make sure that it is instantiated. The specification could be the following:  @Test public void whenInstantiatedThenSetCollection   {   assertNotNull ticTacToe.getTicTacToeCollection   ; }  The instantiation of TicTacToe is already done in the method annotated with @Before. With this specification, we're making sure that the collection is instantiated as well.  Implementation There is nothing special about this implementation. We should simply overwrite the default constructor and assign a new instance to the ticTacToeCollection variable.  To begin with, we should add a local variable and a getter for TicTacToeCollection:  private TicTacToeCollection ticTacToeCollection;  protected TicTacToeCollection getTicTacToeCollection   {   return ticTacToeCollection; }  Now all that's left is to instantiate a new collection and assign it to the variable when the main class is instantiated:  public TicTacToe   throws UnknownHostException {   this new TicTacToeCollection   ; } protected TicTacToe TicTacToeCollection collection  {   ticTacToeCollection = collection; }  We also created another way to instantiate the class by passing TicTacToeCollection as an argument. This will come in handy inside specifications as an easy way to pass a mocked collection.  Now let us go back to the specifications class and make use of this new constructor.  [ 158 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Specification refactoring To utilize a newly created TicTacToe constructor, we can do something such as the following:  private TicTacToeCollection collection;  @Before public final void before   throws UnknownHostException {   collection = mock TicTacToeCollection.class ;    ticTacToe = new TicTacToe  ;   ticTacToe = new TicTacToe collection ; }  Now all our specifications will use a mocked version of the TicTacToeCollection. There are other ways to inject mocked dependencies  for example, with Spring ; however, when possible, we feel that simplicity trumps complicated frameworks.  Specification – storing current move Whenever we play a turn, it should be saved to the DB. The specification can be the following:  @Test public void whenPlayThenSaveMoveIsInvoked   {   TicTacToeBean move = new TicTacToeBean 1, 1, 3, 'X' ;   ticTacToe.play move.getX  , move.getY   ;   verify collection .saveMove move ; }  By now, you should be familiar with Mockito, but let us go through the code as a refresher:  1.   First, we are instantiating a TicTacToeBean since it contains the data that our collections expect:  TicTacToeBean move = new TicTacToeBean 1, 1, 3, 'X' ;  2.   Next, it is time to play an actual turn:  ticTacToe.play move.getX  , move.getY   ;  3.   Finally, we need to verify that the saveMove method is really invoked:  verify collection, times 1  .saveMove move ;  [ 159 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  As we have done throughout this chapter, we isolated all external invocations and focused only on the unit  play  that we're working on. Keep in mind that this isolation is limited only to the public and protected methods. When it comes to the actual implementation, we might choose to add the saveMove invocation to the play public method or one of the private methods that we wrote as a result of the refactoring we did earlier.  Implementation This specification poses a couple of challenges. First, where should we place the invocation of the saveMove method? The setBox private method looks like a good place. That's where we are doing validations of if the turn is valid, and if it is, we can call the saveMove method. However, that method expects a bean instead of the variables x, y, and lastPlayer that are being used right now, so we might want to change the signature of the setBox method.  This is how the method looks now:  private void setBox int x, int y, char lastPlayer  {   if  board[x - 1][y - 1] != '\0'  {     throw new RuntimeException "Box is occupied" ;   } else {     board[x - 1][y - 1] = lastPlayer;   } }  This is how it looks after the necessary changes are applied:  private void setBox TicTacToeBean bean  {   if  board[bean.getX   - 1][bean.getY   - 1] != '\0'  {     throw new RuntimeException "Box is occupied" ;   } else {     board[bean.getX   - 1][bean.getY   - 1] = lastPlayer;     getTicTacToeCollection  .saveMove bean ;   } }  The change of the setBox signature triggers a few other changes. Since it is invoked from the play method, we'll need to instantiate the bean there:  public String play int x, int y  {   checkAxis x ;   checkAxis y ;   lastPlayer = nextPlayer  ;    setBox x, y, lastPlayer ;  [ 160 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6    setBox new TicTacToeBean 1, x, y, lastPlayer  ;   if  isWin x, y   {     return lastPlayer + " is the winner";   } else if  isDraw    {     return RESULT_DRAW;   } else {     return NO_WINNER;   } }  You might have noticed that we used a constant value 1 as a turn. There is still no specification that says otherwise, so we took a shortcut. We'll deal with it later.  All those changes were still very simple, and it took a reasonably short period of time to implement them. If the changes were bigger, we might have chosen a different path; and made a simpler change to get to the final solution through refactoring. Remember that speed is the key. You don't want to get stuck with an implementation that does not pass tests for a long time.  Specification – error handling What happens if a move could not be saved? Our helper method saveMove returns true or false depending on the MongoDB operation outcome. We might want to throw an exception when it returns false.  First things first: we should change the implementation of the before method and make sure that, by default, saveMove returns true:  @Before public final void before   throws UnknownHostException {   collection = mock TicTacToeCollection.class ; doReturn true .when collection .saveMove any TicTacToeBean.class  ;   ticTacToe = new TicTacToe collection ; }  Now that we have stubbed the mocked collection with what we think is the default behavior  return true when saveMove is invoked , we can proceed and write the specification:  @Test public void whenPlayAndSaveReturnsFalseThenThrowException   { doReturn false .when collection .saveMove any TicTacToeBean.class   ;   TicTacToeBean move = new TicTacToeBean 1, 1, 3, 'X' ;  [ 161 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6    exception.expect RuntimeException.class ;   ticTacToe.play move.getX  , move.getY   ; }  We're using Mockito to return false when saveMove is invoked. Since, in this case, we don't care about a specific invocation of saveMove, we used any TicTacToeBean.class  as the method argument. This is another one of Mockito's static methods.  Once everything is set, we use a JUnit expectation in the same way as we did before throughout Chapter 3, Red-Green-Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection.  Implementation Let's do a simple if and throw a RuntimeException when the result is not expected:  private void setBox TicTacToeBean bean  {   if  board[bean.getX   - 1][bean.getY   - 1] != '\0'  {     throw new RuntimeException "Box is occupied" ;   } else {     board[bean.getX   - 1][bean.getY   - 1] = lastPlayer;     getTicTacToeCollection  .saveMove bean ;     if  !getTicTacToeCollection  .saveMove bean   {       throw new RuntimeException "Saving to DB failed" ;     }   } }  Specification – alternate players Do you remember the turn that we hard coded to be always 1? Let's fix that behavior.  We can invoke the play method twice and verify that the turn changes from 1 to 2:  @Test public void whenPlayInvokedMultipleTimesThenTurnIncreases   {   TicTacToeBean move1 = new TicTacToeBean 1, 1, 1, 'X' ;   ticTacToe.play move1.getX  , move1.getY   ;   verify collection, times 1  .saveMove move1 ;   TicTacToeBean move2 = new TicTacToeBean 2, 1, 2, 'O' ;   ticTacToe.play move2.getX  , move2.getY   ;   verify collection, times 1  .saveMove move2 ; }  [ 162 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Implementation As with almost everything else done in the TDD fashion, implementation is fairly easy:  private int turn = 0; ... public String play int x, int y  {   checkAxis x ;   checkAxis y ;   lastPlayer = nextPlayer  ;   setBox new TicTacToeBean ++turn, x, y, lastPlayer  ;   if  isWin x, y   {     return lastPlayer + " is the winner";   } else if  isDraw    {     return RESULT_DRAW;   } else {     return NO_WINNER;   } }  Exercises A few more specifications and their implementations are still missing. We should invoke the drop   method whenever our TicTacToe class is instantiated. We should also make sure that RuntimeException is thrown when drop   returns false. We'll leave those specifications and their implementations as an exercise for you.  The source code can be found in the 03-mongo branch of the tdd-java-ch06-tic-tac- toe-mongo Git repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch06-tic-tac-toe-mongo branch 03-mongo . The classes in particular are TicTacToeSpec and TicTacToe.  [ 163 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Integration tests We did a lot of unit tests. We relied a lot on trust. Unit after unit was specified and implemented. While working on specifications, we isolated everything but the units we were working on, and verified that one invoked the other correctly. However, the time has come to validate that all those units are truly able to communicate with MongoDB. We might have made a mistake or, more importantly, we might not have MongoDB up and running. It would be a disaster to discover that, for example, we deployed our application, but forgot to bring up the DB, or that the configuration  IP, port, and so on  is not set correctly.  The integration test's objective is to validate, as you might have guessed, the integration of separate components, applications, systems, and so on. If you remember the testing pyramid, it states that unit tests are the easiest to write and fastest to run, so we should keep other types of tests limited to things that UTs did not cover.  We should isolate our integration tests in a way that they can be run occasionally  before we push our code to repository, or as a part of our continuous integration  CI  process  and keep unit test as a continuous feedback loop.  Tests separation If we follow some kind of convention, it is fairly easy to separate tests in Gradle. We can have our tests in different directories and distinct packages or, for example, with different file suffixes. In this case, we choose the latter. All our specification classes are named with the Spec suffix  that is, TicTacToeSpec . We can make a rule that all integration tests have the Integ suffix.  With that in mind, let us modify our build.gradle file.  First, we'll tell Gradle that only classes ending with Spec should be used by the test task:  test {     include '** *Spec.class' }  [ 164 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Next, we can create a new task, testInteg:  task testInteg type: Test  {     include '** *Integ.class' }  With those two additions to build.gradle, we continue having the test tasks that we used heavily throughout the book; however, this time, they are limited only to specifications  unit tests . In addition, all integration tests can be run by clicking the testInteg task from the Gradle projects IDEA window or running the following command from command prompt:  gradle testInteg  Let us write a simple integration test.  The integration test We'll create a TicTacToeInteg class inside the com.packtpublishing.tddjava.ch03tictactoe package in the src test java directory. Since we know that Jongo throws an exception if it cannot connect to the database, a test class can be as simple as the following:  import org.junit.Test; import java.net.UnknownHostException; import static org.junit.Assert.*;  public class TicTacToeInteg {    @Test   public void givenMongoDbIsRunningWhenPlayThenNoException           throws UnknownHostException {     TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe  ;     assertEquals TicTacToe.NO_WINNER, ticTacToe.play 1, 1  ;   } }  [ 165 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  The invocation of assertEquals is just as a precaution. The real objective of this test is to make sure that no Exception is thrown. Since we did not start MongoDB  unless you are very proactive and did it yourself, in which case you should stop it , test should fail:  Now that we know that the integration test works, or in other words, that it indeed fails when MongoDB is not up and running, let us try it again with the DB started. To bring up MongoDB, we'll use Vagrant to create a virtual machine with Ubuntu OS. MongoDB will be run as a Docker.  [ 166 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  Make sure that the 04-integration branch is checked out:  From the command prompt, run the following command:  $ vagrant up  Be patient until VM is up and running  it might take a while when executed for the first time, especially on a slower bandwidth . Once finished, rerun integration tests:  [ 167 ]   Mocking – Removing External Dependencies  Chapter 6  It worked, and now we're confident that we are indeed integrated with MongoDB.  This was a very simplistic integration test, and in the real-world, we would do a bit more than this single test. We could, for example, query the DB and confirm that data was stored correctly. However, the purpose of this chapter was to learn both how to mock and that we should not depend only on unit tests. The next chapter will explore integration and functional tests in more depth.  The source code can be found in the 04-integration branch of the tdd-java-ch06-tic- tac-toe-mongo Git repository  https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch06-tic-tac-toe-mongo branch 04-integr ation .  Summary Mocking and spying techniques are used to isolate different parts of code or third-party libraries. They are essential if we are to proceed with great speed, not only while coding, but also while running tests. Tests without mocks are often too complex to write and can be so slow that, with time, TDD tends to become close to impossible. Slow tests mean that we won't be able to run all of them every time we write a new specification. That in itself leads to deterioration in the confidence we have in the our tests, since only a part of them is run.  Mocking is not only useful as a way to isolate external dependencies, but also as a way to isolate our own code from a unit we're working on.  In this chapter, we presented Mockito as, in our opinion, the framework with the best balance between functionality and ease of use. We invite you to investigate its documentation in more detail  http:  mockito.org  , as well as other Java frameworks dedicated to mocking. EasyMock  http:  easymock.org  , JMock  http:  www.jmock.org  , and PowerMock  https:  code.google.com p powermock   are a few of the most popular.  In the next chapter we are going to put some functional programming concepts as well as some TDD concepts applied to them. For that matter, part of the Java functional API is going to be presented.  [ 168 ]   7  TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."  – Arthur C. Clarke  All of the code examples that we have seen so far in this book follow a particular programming paradigm: object-oriented programming  OOP . This paradigm has monopolized the software industry for a long time and the majority of software companies have adopted OOP as the standard way of programming.  However the fact that OOP has become the most used paradigm does not mean it is the only one that exists. In fact, there are more that are worth mentioning, but this chapter is going to focus only on one of them: functional programming. Additionally, this book's language is Java, so all code snippets and examples will be based on the functional API that were included in version 8 of Java.  Topics covered in this chapter include:  Optional class Functions revisited Streams Applying TDD to functional programming   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  Setting up the environment In order to explore some of the goodies of Java Functional Programming in a test-driven fashion, we are going to set up a Java project with JUnit and AssertJ frameworks. The last one includes quite a few convenient methods for Optional.   Let's start a new Gradle project. This is how build.gradle looks:  apply plugin: 'java'  sourceCompatibility = 1.8 targetCompatibility = 1.8  repositories {   mavenCentral   }  dependencies {   testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12'   testCompile group: 'org.assertj', name: 'assertj-core', version: '3.9.0' }  In the following sections, we are going to explore some of the utilities and classes included in Java 8 that enhance the experience of programming. Most of them are not only for functional programming and can be used even in imperative-style programming.  Optional – dealing with uncertainty  Since it was created, null has been used and misused by developers innumerable times in innumerable programs. One of the common cases for null is, among others, to represent the absence of a value. That is not convenient at all; it could either represent the absence of a value or the abnormal execution of a piece of code.  Moreover, in order to access variables that can potentially be null, and mitigate undesired runtime exceptions like NullPointerException, developers tend to wrap variables with an if statement so those variables are accessed in safe mode. Although it works, this protection against nulls adds some boilerplate that has nothing to do with the functionality or the goal of the code:  if  name != null  {      do something with name }  [ 170 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  The preceding code overcomes the problems that the creator of null spotted in his famous quote during a conference in 2009:  "I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language  ALGOL W . My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years."  – Tony Hoare  With the release of Java 8, the utility class called Optional was included as an alternative to the preceding code block. Among other benefits, it brings compilation checks and zero boilerplate code. Let's see Optional in action with a simple example.  Example of Optional As a demonstration of Optional, we are going to create an in-memory student repository. This repository has a method to find students by their name, which, for convenience, will be considered the ID. The value returned by the method is Optional ; this means that the response might or might not contain a Student. This pattern is basically one of the common scenarios for Optional.  At this point, the reader should be familiar with the TDD process. For the sake of brevity the complete Red-Green-Refactor process is skipped. Tests are going to be presented along with the implementation in a convenient order, which could not coincide with the order in a TDD iteration.  First of all, we need a Student class to represent students within our system. To keep it simple, our implementation is going to be very basic, with only two parameters: the student's name and age:  public class Student {   public final String name;   public final int age;   public Student String name, int age  {     this.name = name;     this.age = age;  [ 171 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7    } }  The next test class verifies two scenarios: a successful lookup and an unsuccessful one. Note that AssertJ has some useful and meaningful assertion methods for Optional. That makes testing really fluent and readable:  public class StudentRepositoryTest {    private List  studentList = Arrays.asList      new Student "Jane", 23 ,     new Student "John", 21 ,     new Student "Tom", 25     ;    private StudentRepository studentRepository =     new StudentRepository studentList ;    @Test   public void whenStudentIsNotFoundThenReturnEmpty   {     assertThat studentRepository.findByName "Samantha"         .isNotPresent  ;   }    @Test   public void whenStudentIsFoundThenReturnStudent   {     assertThat studentRepository.findByName "John"         .isPresent  ;   } }  In cases where verifying the existence of a student with that name is not enough, we can perform some assertions on the returned object. In the majority of scenarios, this is the way to go:  @Test public void whenStudentIsFoundThenReturnStudent   {   assertThat studentRepository.findByName "John"       .hasValueSatisfying s -> {       assertThat s.name .isEqualTo "John" ;       assertThat s.age .isEqualTo 21 ;     } ; }  [ 172 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  Now, it's time to focus on the StudentRepository class, which contains only one constructor and the method to perform student lookups. As shown in the following code, the lookup method findByName returns an Optional holding a Student. Note that this is a valid yet not functional implementation used as a starting point:  public class StudentRepository {   StudentRepository Collection  students  { }    public Optional  findByName String name  {     return Optional.empty  ;   } }  If we run the tests against the preceding implementation we get one successful test, because the lookup method is returning by default an Optional.empty  . The other test throws an error, as follows:  java.lang.AssertionError: Expecting Optional to contain a value but was empty.  For the sake of completeness, this is one of the possible implementations:  public class StudentRepository {   private final Set  studentSet;    StudentRepository Collection  students  {     studentSet = new HashSet  students ;   }    public Optional  findByName String name  {     for  Student student : this.studentSet  {       if  student.name.equals name           return Optional.of student ;     }     return Optional.empty  ;   } }  In the next section, we will see a different point of view on functions. In Java 8, some additional capabilities have been added to functions if they are used in a particular way. We are going to explore a few of them with some examples.  [ 173 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  Functions revisited Unlike object-oriented programs, those written in a functional way don't hold any mutable state. Instead, code is made up with functions that take arguments and return values. Because there is no internal state nor side-effects involved that can alter the execution, all functions are deterministic. This is a really good feature because it implies that different executions of the same function, with the same parameters, would produce the same outcome.  The following snippet illustrates a function that does not mutate any internal state:  public Integer add Integer a, Integer b  {   return a + b; }  The following is the same function written using Java's functional API:  public final BinaryOperator  add =   new BinaryOperator    {      @Override     public Integer apply Integer a, Integer b  {       return a + b;     }   };  The first example should be completely familiar to any Java developer; it follows the common syntax of a function that takes two integers as arguments and returns the sum of them. The second example, however, differs a bit from the traditional code we are used to. In this new version, the function is an object that counts as a value, and it can be assigned to a field. This is quite convenient in some scenarios because it can still be used as a function in some cases and in some others it can also be used as a return value, as an argument in a function or a field within a class.  One can argue that the first version of the function is more appropriated since it is shorter and does not require creating a new object. Well, it's true, but the fact that functions can also be objects enhances them with a bunch of new capabilities. Regarding code verbosity, it can be considerably reduced to a single line by using a lambda expression:  public final BinaryOperator  addLambda =  a, b  -> a + b;  [ 174 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  In the next section, a possible solution to Reverse Polish Notation  RPN  kata is presented. We are going to use the power and expressiveness of functional programming, particularly the lambda notation, which becomes really handy when functions are required as arguments of some functions. Using lambdas makes our code very concise and elegant, increasing the readability.  Kata – Reverse Polish Notation RPN is a notation used for representing mathematical expressions. It differs from the  traditional and widely used infix notation in the order of operators and operands.  In infix notation the operator is placed between the operands, whereas in RPN, operands are placed first and the operator is located at the end.   This is an expression written using infix notation:  The same expression written using RPN:  3 + 4  3 4 +  Requirements We are going to obviate how the expressions are read so that we can focus on solving the problem. Furthermore, we are going to work only with positive integers to simplify the problem, although it shouldn't be very difficult to accept floats or doubles as well. In order to solve this kata, we are asked to fulfill only the following two requirements:  On invalid input  not a RPN , an error message should be thrown It gets an arithmetic expression written using RPN and computes the result  [ 175 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  The following code snippet is a small scaffold for us to start our project upon:  public class ReversePolishNotation {   int compute String expression  {     return 0;   } }  public class NotReversePolishNotationError extends RuntimeException {   public NotReversePolishNotationError   {     super "Not a Reverse Polish Notation" ;   } }  With the preceding code fragment as the starting point, we are going to proceed, breaking down the requirements into smaller specifications that can be tackled one by one.  Requirement – handling invalid input Provided that our implementation is basically doing nothing, we are going to focus only on one thing—reading single operands. If the input is a single number  no operators  then it's a valid reverse notation and the value of the number is returned. Anything other than that is considered not a valid RPN for now.  This requirement is translated into these four tests:  public class ReversePolishNotationTest {   private ReversePolishNotation reversePolishNotation =     new ReversePolishNotation  ;    @Test expected = NotReversePolishNotationError.class    public void emptyInputThrowsError   {     reversePolishNotation.compute "" ;   }    @Test expected = NotReversePolishNotationError.class    public void notANumberThrowsError   {     reversePolishNotation.compute "a" ;   }    @Test   public void oneDigitReturnsNumber   {     assertThat reversePolishNotation.compute "7"  .isEqualTo 7 ;   }  [ 176 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7    @Test   public void moreThanOneDigitReturnsNumber   { assertThat reversePolishNotation.compute "120"  .isEqualTo 120 ;   } }  Our compute method is now required to throw an IllegalArgumentException when an invalid input is provided. In any other case it returns the number as an integer value. This can be achieved with the following lines of code:  public class ReversePolishNotation {   int compute String expression  {     try {       return  Integer.parseInt expression  ;     } catch  NumberFormatException e  {       throw new NotReversePolishNotationError  ;     }   } }  This requirement has been fulfilled. The other requirement is a bit more complex, so we are going to divide it into two—single operations, which means only one operation, and complex operations, which involve more than one operation of any kind.  Requirement – single operations So, the plan is to support add, subtract, multiply and divide operations. As explained in the kata presentation, in RPN the operator is located at the end of the expression.  That means a - b is represented as a b -, and the same applies to the other operators: addition +,  multiplication *,  and division  .  Let's add one of each of the supported operations to our tests:  @Test public void addOperationReturnsCorrectValue   {   assertThat reversePolishNotation.compute "1 2 +"  .isEqualTo 3 ; }  @Test public void subtractOperationReturnsCorrectValue   {   assertThat reversePolishNotation.compute "2 1 -"  .isEqualTo 1 ; }  [ 177 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  @Test public void multiplyOperationReturnsCorrectValue   {   assertThat reversePolishNotation.compute "2 1 *"  .isEqualTo 2 ; }  @Test public void divideOperationReturnsCorrectValue   {   assertThat reversePolishNotation.compute "2 2  "  .isEqualTo 1 ; }  This also includes the necessary changes to make them pass successfully. The behavior is basically placing the operator between the expressions and performing the operation in case an expression is given as input. If there is only one element in the expression, then the former rules apply:  int compute String expression  {   String[] elems = expression.trim  .split " " ;   if  elems.length != 1 && elems.length != 3      throw new NotReversePolishNotationError  ;   if  elems.length == 1  {     return parseInt elems[0] ;   } else {     if  "+".equals elems[2]         return parseInt elems[0]  + parseInt elems[1] ;     else if  "-".equals elems[2]         return parseInt elems[0]  - parseInt elems[1] ;     else if  "*".equals elems[2]         return parseInt elems[0]  * parseInt elems[1] ;     else if  " ".equals elems[2]         return parseInt elems[0]    parseInt elems[1] ;     else       throw new NotReversePolishNotationError  ;   } }  private int parseInt String number  {   try {     return Integer.parseInt number ;   } catch  NumberFormatException e  {     throw new NotReversePolishNotationError  ;   } }  [ 178 ]  parseInt is a private method that parses the input and either returns the integer value or throws an exception:   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  The next requirement is where the magic happens. We are going to support more than one operation within the expression.  Requirement – complex operations Complex operations are difficult to address, because mixing operations makes it really difficult for the non-trained human eye to understand in which order the operations should take place. Also, different evaluation orders usually lead to different results. To solve that, the computation of reverse polish expressions is backed up by the implementation of a queue. These are some tests for our next functionality:  @Test public void multipleAddOperationsReturnCorrectValue   {   assertThat reversePolishNotation.compute "1 2 5 + +"       .isEqualTo 8 ; }  @Test public void multipleDifferentOperationsReturnCorrectValue   {   assertThat reversePolishNotation.compute "5 12 + 3 -"       .isEqualTo 14 ; }  @Test public void aComplexTest   {   assertThat reversePolishNotation.compute "5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -"       .isEqualTo 14 ; }  The computation should pile up the numbers or operands in the expression sequentially, from left to right, in a queue or stack in Java. If at any point an operator is found then the pile replaces the two elements on top with the result of applying that operator to those values. For better comprehension, the logic is going to be separated in to different functions.  First of all, we are going to define a function that takes a stack and an operation and applies the function to the first two items on the top. Note that the second operand is retrieved in the first instance due to the implementation of stack:  private static void applyOperation      Stack  stack,     BinaryOperator  operation   {   int b = stack.pop  , a = stack.pop  ;   stack.push operation.apply a, b  ; }  [ 179 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  The next step is to create all the functions that our program must handle. For each operator a function is defined as an object. This has some advantages, such as better isolation for testing. In this case it might not make sense to test functions separately because they are trivial, but there are some other scenarios where testing the logic of these functions in isolation can be very useful:  static BinaryOperator  ADD =  a, b  -> a + b; static BinaryOperator  SUBTRACT =  a, b  -> a - b; static BinaryOperator  MULTIPLY =  a, b  -> a * b; static BinaryOperator  DIVIDE =  a, b  -> a   b;  And now, putting all the pieces together. Depending on the operator we find, the proper operation is applied:  int compute String expression  {   Stack  stack = new Stack   ;   for  String elem : expression.trim  .split " "   {     if  "+".equals elem         applyOperation stack, ADD ;     else if  "-".equals elem         applyOperation stack, SUBTRACT ;     else if  "*".equals elem         applyOperation stack, MULTIPLY ;     else if  " ".equals elem         applyOperation stack, DIVIDE ;     else {       stack.push parseInt elem  ;     }   }   if  stack.size   == 1  return stack.pop  ;   else throw new NotReversePolishNotationError  ; }  The code is readable and very easy to understand. Moreover, this design allows the extending of the functionality by adding support to other different operations with ease.  It can be a good exercise for readers to add a modulus  %  operation to the provided solution.  Another good example where lambdas fit perfectly is Streams API, since most functions have a self-explanatory name like filter, map or reduce, among others. Let's explore this more deeply in the next section.  [ 180 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  Streams One of the top utilities included in Java 8 are Streams. In this chapter we are going to use lambdas in combination with Streams in small code fragments, and create a test to verify them.  To better understand what Streams are, what to do, and what not to do with them, it is highly recommended to read Oracle's Stream pages. A good starting point is https: ​ ​docs. oracle.​com ​javase ​8 ​docs ​api ​java ​util ​stream ​Stream.​html.  To cut a long story short, Streams provide a bunch of facilities to deal with long computations that can be executed either in parallel or sequential order. Parallel programming is out of the scope of this book, so the next examples will be sequential only. Furthermore, in order to keep the chapter concise we are going to focus on:  filter  map  flatMap  reduce  filter Let's start with the filter operation. Filters is a function with a self-explanatory name; it filters in out elements in the stream depending on whether the value satisfies a condition, as shown in the following example:  @Test public void filterByNameReturnsCollectionFiltered   {   List  names = Arrays.asList "Alex", "Paul", "Viktor",          "Kobe", "Tom", "Andrea" ;   List  filteredNames = Collections.emptyList  ;    assertThat filteredNames        .hasSize 2        .containsExactlyInAnyOrder "Alex", "Andrea" ; }  One possibility for computing the list of filteredNames is the following:  List  filteredNames = names.stream         .filter name -> name.startsWith "A"         .collect Collectors.toList   ;  [ 181 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  That one is the easiest. In a few words, filter filters the input and returns a value without all the elements filtered out. Using lambdas makes the code elegant and really easy to read.  map The map function transforms all the elements in the stream into another. The resultant object can share the type with the input, but it's also possible to return an object of a different type:  @Test public void mapToUppercaseTransformsAllElementsToUppercase   {   List  names = Arrays.asList "Alex", "Paul", "Viktor" ;   List  namesUppercase = Collections.emptyList  ;    assertThat namesUppercase        .hasSize 3        .containsExactly "ALEX", "PAUL", "VIKTOR" ; }  The list namesUppercase should be computed as follows:  List  namesUppercase = names.stream     .map String::toUpperCase    .collect Collectors.toList   ;  Note how the toUpperCase method is called. It belongs to the Java class String and can be used in that scenario only by referencing the function and the class that function belongs to. In Java, this is called method reference.  flatMap The flatMap function is very similar to the map function, but it is used when the operation might return more than one value and we want to keep a stream of single elements. In the case of map, a stream of collections would be returned instead. Let's see flatMap in use:  @Test public void gettingLettersUsedInNames   {   List  names = Arrays.asList "Alex", "Paul", "Viktor" ;   List  lettersUsed = Collections.emptyList  ;    assertThat lettersUsed      .hasSize 12  .containsExactly "a","l","e","x","p","u","v","i","k","t","o","r" ; }  [ 182 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  One possible solution could be:  List  lettersUsed = names.stream     .map String::toLowerCase    .flatMap name -> Stream.of name.split ""      .distinct     .collect Collectors.toList   ;  This time we have used Stream.of  , a convenient method for creating Streams. Another really nice feature is the method distinct  , which returns a collection of unique elements, comparing them using the method equals  .  reduce In the previous example, the function returns the list of letters used in all the names passed as input. But if we are only interested in the number of different letters, there's an easier way to proceed. reduce basically applies a function to all elements and combines them into one single result. Let's see an example:  @Test public void countingLettersUsedInNames   {   List  names = Arrays.asList "Alex", "Paul", "Viktor" ;   long count = 0;    assertThat count .isEqualTo 12 ; }  This solution is very similar to the one we used for the previous exercise:  long count = names.stream     .map String::toLowerCase    .flatMap name -> Stream.of name.split ""      .distinct     .mapToLong l -> 1L    .reduce 0L,  v1, v2  -> v1 + v2 ;  Even though the preceding code snippet solves the problem, there is a much nicer way to do it:  long count = names.stream     .map String::toLowerCase    .flatMap name -> Stream.of name.split ""      .distinct     .count  ;  [ 183 ]   TDD and Functional Programming – A Perfect Match  Chapter 7  The function count   is another built-in tool that Streams includes. It's a particular shortcut for a reduction function that counts the number of elements the stream contains.  Summary Functional programming is an old concept that is gaining popularity, because it's easier to use when trying to increase performance by executing tasks in parallel. In this chapter some concepts from the functional world were presented along with some of the test tools that AssertJ provides.   Testing functions without side effects is very easy because the test scope is reduced. Instead of testing changes that the function might cause on different objects, the only thing that needs to be verified is the outcome of the invocation. No side-effects means that the outcome of the function is the same as long as the parameters are the same. Therefore, the execution is repeatable as many times as needed and leads to the same result on every execution. Additionally, tests are easier to read and comprehend.  To conclude, Java includes a good API for functional programming if you need to use this paradigm within your projects. But there are some languages, some of them purely functional, that offer more powerful features with better syntax and less boilerplate. You should evaluate whether using one of those other languages might make sense if your project or approach can be purely functional.  All of the examples presented in this chapter can be found at https: ​ ​bitbucket.​org  alexgarcia ​tdd-​java-​funcprog.​git.  Now it is time to take a look at legacy code and how to adapt it and make it more TDD friendly.  [ 184 ]   8  – Kent Beck  BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  "I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits."  Everything we have done until now is related to techniques that can be applied only by developers, for developers. Customers, business representatives, and other parties that are not capable of reading and understanding code were not involved in the process.  TDD can be much more than what we have done up to now. We can define requirements, discuss them with the client, and get agreement as to what should be developed. We can use those same requirements and make them executable so that they drive and validate our development. We can use ubiquitous language to write acceptance criteria. All this, and more, is accomplished with a flavor of TDD called behavior-driven development  BDD .  We'll develop a book store application using a BDD approach. We'll define acceptance criteria in English, make the implementation of each feature separately, confirm that it is working correctly by running BDD scenarios and, if required, refactor the code to accomplish the desired level of quality. The process still follows the Red-Green-Refactor that is the essence of TDD. The major difference is the definition level. While, until this moment, we have been mostly working at the units level, this time we'll move a bit higher and apply TDD through functional and integration tests.   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Our frameworks of choice will be JBehave and Selenide.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  The different types of specifications Behavior-driven development  BDD  The book store BDD story JBehave  Different specifications We have already mentioned that one of the benefits of TDD is executable documentation that is always up to date. However, documentation obtained through unit tests is often not enough. When working at such a low-level, we get insights into details; however, it is all too easy to miss the big picture. If, for example, you were to inspect specifications that we created for the Tic-Tac-Toe game, you might easily miss the point of the application. You would understand what each unit does and how it interoperates with other units, but would have a hard time grasping the idea behind it. To be precise, you would understand that unit X does Y and communicates with Z; however, the functional documentation and the idea behind it would be, at best, hard to find.  The same can be said for development. Before we start working on specifications in the form of unit tests, we need to get a bigger picture. Throughout this book, you were presented with requirements that we used for writing specifications that resulted in their implementation. Those requirements were later on discarded; they are nowhere to be seen. We did not put them in to the repository, nor did we use them to validate the result of our work.  [ 186 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Documentation In many of the organizations that we worked with, the documentation was created for the wrong reasons. The management tends to think that documentation is somehow related to project success—that without a lot of  often short-lived  documentation, the project will fail. Thus, we are asked to spend a lot of time planning, answering questions, and filling in questionnaires that are often designed not to help the project but to provide an illusion that everything is under control. Someone's existence is often justified with documentation  the result of my work is this document . It also serves as a reassurance that everything is going as planned  there is an Excel sheet that states that we are on schedule . However, by far the most common reason for the creation of documentation is a process that simply states that certain documents need to be created. We might question the value of those documents, however, since the process is sacred, they need to be produced.  Not only might that documentation be created for the wrong reasons and not provide enough value, but, as is often the case, it might also do a lot of damage. If we created the documentation, it is natural that we trust it. However, what happens if that documentation is not up to date? The requirements are changing, bugs are getting fixed, new functionalities are being developed, and some are being removed. If given enough time, all traditional documentation becomes obsolete. The sheer task of updating documentation with every change we make to the code is so big and complex that, sooner or later, we must face the fact that static documents do not reflect the reality. If we are putting our trust into something that is not accurate, our development is based on wrong assumptions.  The only accurate documentation is our code. The code is what we develop, what we deploy, and is the only source that truthfully represents our application. However, code is not readable by everyone involved with the project. Besides coders, we might work with managers, testers, business people, end users, and so on.  In search of a better way to define what would constitute better documentation, let us explore a bit further into who the potential documentation consumers are. For the sake of simplicity, we'll divide them into coders  those capable of reading and understanding code  and non-coders  everyone else .  [ 187 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Documentation for coders Developers work with code and, since we have established that code is the most accurate documentation, there is no reason to not utilize it. If you want to understand what some method does, take a look at the code of that method. In doubt about what some class does? Take a look at that class. Having trouble understanding a piece of code? We have a problem! However, the problem is not that the documentation is missing, but that the code itself is not written well.  Looking at the code to understand the code is still often not enough. Even though you might understand what the code does, the purpose of that code might not be so obvious. Why was it written in the first place?  That's where specifications come in. Not only are we using them to continuously validate the code, but they also act as executable documentation. They are always up to date because if they aren't, their execution will fail. At the same time, while code itself should be written in a way that is easy to read and understand, specifications provide a much easier and faster way to understand the reasons, logic, and motivations that lead us to write some piece of implementation code.  Using code as documentation does not exclude other types. Quite the contrary, the key is not to avoid using static documentation, but to avoid duplication. When code provides the necessary details, use it before anything else. In most cases, this leaves us with higher-level documentation, such as an overview, the general purpose of the system, the technologies used, the environment set-up, the installation, building, and packaging, and other types of data that tend to serve more like guidelines and quick-start information than detailed information. For those cases, a simple README in markdown format  http:  whatismarkdown.com   tends to be the best.  For all code-based documentation, TDD is the best enabler. Until now, we worked only with units  methods . We are yet to see how to apply TDD on a higher-level, such as, for example, functional specifications. However, before we get there, let's speak about other roles in the team.  [ 188 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Documentation for non-coders Traditional testers tend to form groups completely separated from developers. This separation leads to an increased number of testers who are not familiar with code and assume that their job is to be quality checkers. They are validators at the end of the process and act as a kind of border police who decide what can be deployed and what should be returned back. There is, on the other hand, an increasing number of organizations that are employing testers as integral members of the team, with the job of ensuring that quality is built in. This latter group requires testers to be proficient with code. For them, using code as documentation is quite natural. However, what should we do with the first group? What should we do with testers who do not understand the code? Also, it is not only  some  testers that fall into this group. Managers, end-users, business representatives, and so on are also included. The world is full of people that cannot read and understand code.  We should look for a way to retain the advantages that the executable documentation provides, but write it in a way that can be understood by everyone. Moreover, in TDD fashion, we should allow everyone to participate in the creation of executable documentation from the very start. We should allow them to define requirements that we'll use to develop applications and, at the same time, to validate the result of that development. We need something that will define what we'll do on a higher-level, since low-level is already covered with unit tests. To summarize, we need documentation that can serve as requirements, that can be executed, that can validate our work, and that can be written and understood by everyone.  Say hello to BDD.  Behavior-driven development Behavior-driven development  BDD  is an agile process designed to keep the focus on stakeholder value throughout the whole project; it is a form of TDD. Specifications are defined in advance, the implementation is done according to those specifications, and they are run periodically to validate the outcome. Besides those similarities, there are a few differences as well. Unlike TDD, which is based on unit tests, BDD encourages us to write multiple specifications  called scenarios  before starting the implementation  coding . Even though there is no specific rule, BDD tends to levitate towards higher-level functional requirements. While it can be employed at a unit level as well, the real benefits are obtained when taking a higher approach that can be written and understood by everyone. The audience is another difference—BDD tries to empower everyone  coders, testers, managers, end users, business representatives, and so on .  [ 189 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  While TDD, which is based on unit level, can be described as inside-out  we begin with units and build up towards functionalities , BDD is often understood as outside-in  we start with features and go inside towards units . BDD acts as an acceptance criteria that acts as an indicator of readiness. It tells us when something is finished and ready for production.  We start by defining functionalities  or behaviors , work on them by employing TDD with unit tests, and, once a complete behavior has finished, validate with BDD. One BDD scenario can take hours or even days to finish. During all that time, we can employ TDD and unit testing. Once we're done, we run BDD scenarios to do the final validation. TDD is for coders and has a very fast cycle, while BDD is for everyone and has a much slower turnout time. For each BDD scenario, we have many TDD unit tests.  At this point, you might have gotten confused about what BDD really is, so let us go back a bit. We'll start with the explanation of its format.  Narrative A BDD story consists of one narrative followed by at least one scenario. A narrative is only informative, and its main purpose is to provide just enough information that can serve as a beginning of communication between everyone involved  testers, business representatives, developers, analysts, and so on . It is a short and simple description of a feature, told from the perspective of a person who requires it.  The goal of a narrative is to answer three basic questions:  1. 2. 3.  In order to: What is the benefit or value of the feature that should be built? As a: Who needs the feature that was requested? I want to: What is the feature or goal that should be developed?  Once we have those questions answered, we can start defining what we think would be the best solution. This thinking process results in scenarios that provide a lower-level of detail.  Until now, we were working at a very low-level using unit tests as a driving force. We were specifying what should be built from the coder's perspective. We assumed that high-level requirements were defined earlier and that our job was to do the code specific to one of them. Now, let us take a few steps back and start from the beginning.  [ 190 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Let us act, let's say, as a customer or a business representative. Someone got this great idea and we are discussing it with the rest of the team. In short, we want to build an online book store. It is only an idea and we're not even certain of how it will develop, so we want to work on a Minimum Viable Product  MVP . One of the roles that we want to explore is the one of a store administrator. This person should be able to add new books and update or remove the existing ones. All those actions should be doable, because we want this person to be able to manage our book store collection in an efficient way. The narrative that we came up with for this role is the following:  In order to manage the book store collection efficiently As a store administrator I want to be able to add, update, and remove books  Now that we know what the benefit is  managing books , who needs it  administrator , and finally what the feature that should be developed is  insert, update, and delete operations . Keep in mind that this was not a detailed description of what should be done. The narrative's purpose is to initiate a discussion that will result in one or more scenarios.  Unlike TDD unit tests, narratives, and indeed the rest of the BDD story, can be written by anyone. They do not require coding skills, nor do they have to go into too many details. Depending on the organization, all narratives can be written by the same person  a business representative, product owner, customer, and so on  or it might be a collaborative effort by the whole team.  Now that we have a clearer idea regarding narratives, let us take a look at scenarios.  Scenarios A narrative acts as a communication enabler, and scenarios are the result of that communication. They should describe interactions that the role  specified in the Narrative section  has with the system. Unlike unit tests, which were written as code by developers for developers, BDD scenarios should be defined in plain language and with minimum technical details so that all those involved with the project  developers, testers, designers, managers, customers, and so on  can have a common understanding about behaviors  or features  that will be added to the system.  [ 191 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Scenarios act as the acceptance criteria of the narrative. Once all scenarios related to the narrative are run successfully, the job can be considered done. Each scenario is very similar to a unit test, with the main difference being the scope  one method against a whole feature  and the time it takes to implement it  a few seconds or minutes against a few hours or even days . Similarly to unit tests, scenarios drive the development; they are defined first.  Each scenario consists of a description and one or more steps that start with the words Given, When, or Then. The description is short and only informative. It helps us to understand, at a glance, what the scenario does. Steps, on the other hand, are a sequence of the preconditions, events, and expected outcomes of the scenario. They help us define the behavior unambiguously and it's easy to translate them to automated tests.  Throughout this chapter, we'll focus more on the technical aspects of BDD and the ways they fit into the developer's mindset. For broader usage of BDD and much deeper discussion, consult the book, Specification by Example: How Successful Teams Deliver the Right Software by Gojko Adzic.  The Given step defines a context or preconditions that need to be fulfilled for the rest of the scenario to be successful. Going back to the book's administration narrative, one such precondition might be the following:  Given user is on the books screen  This is a very simple but pretty necessary precondition. Our website might have many pages, and we need to make sure that the user is on the correct screen before we perform any action.  The When step defines an action or some kind of an event. In our narrative, we defined that the administrator should be able to add, update, and remove books. Let's see what should be an action related to, for example, the delete operation:  When user selects a book When user clicks the deleteBook button  [ 192 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  In this example, we multiplied actions defined with the When steps. First, we should select a book and then we should click on the deleteBook button. In this case, we used an ID  deleteBook  instead of text  Delete the book  to define the button that should be clicked. In most cases, IDs are preferable because they provide multiple benefits. They are unique  only one ID can exist on a given screen , they provide clear instructions for developers  create an element with an ID deleteBook , and they are not affected by other changes on the same screen. The text of an element can easily change; if this happens, all scenarios that used it would fail as well. In the case of websites, an alternative could be XPath. However, avoid this whenever possible. It tends to fail with the smallest change to the HTML structure.  Similarly to unit tests, scenarios should be reliable and fail when a feature is not yet developed or when there is a real problem. Otherwise, it is a natural reaction to start ignoring specifications when they produce false negatives.  Finally, we should always end the scenario with some kind of verification. We should specify the desired outcome of actions that were performed. Following the same scenario, our Then step could be the following:  Then book is removed  This outcome strikes a balance between providing just enough data and not going into design details. We could have, for example, mentioned the database or, even more specifically, MongoDB. However, in many cases, that information is not important from the behavioral point of view. We should simply confirm that the book is removed from the catalog, no matter where it is stored.  Now that we are familiar with the BDD story format, let us write the book store BDD story.  The book store BDD story Before we start, clone the code that is available at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch08-books-store. It is an empty project that we'll use throughout this chapter. As with previous chapters, it contains branches for each section, in case you miss something.  We'll write one BDD story that will be in a pure text format, in plain English and without any code. That way, all stakeholders can participate and get involved independently of their coding proficiency. Later on, we'll see how to automate the story we're writing.  [ 193 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Let us start by creating a new file called administration.story inside the stories directory:  We already have the narrative that we wrote earlier, so we'll build on top of that:  Narrative: In order to manage the book store collection efficiently As a store administrator I want to be able to add, update, and remove books  We'll be using JBehave format for writing stories. More details regarding JBehave are coming soon. Until then, visit http:  jbehave.org  for more info.  A narrative always starts with the Narrative line and is followed with the In order to, As a, and I want to lines. We already discussed the meaning of each of them.  [ 194 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Now that we know the answers to why, who, and what, it is time to sit with the rest of the team and discuss possible scenarios. We're still not talking about steps  Given, When, and Then , but simply what would be the outlines or short descriptions of the potential scenarios. The list could be the following:  Scenario: Book details form should have all fields Scenario: User should be able to create a new book Scenario: User should be able to display book details Scenario: User should be able to update book details Scenario: User should be able to delete a book  We're following the JBehave syntax by using Scenario followed by a short description. There is no reason to go into detail at this stage; the purpose of this stage is to serve as a quick brainstorming session. In this case, we came up with those five scenarios. The first one should define fields of the form that we'll use to administer books. The rest of the scenarios are trying to define different administrative tasks. There's nothing truly creative about them. We're supposed to develop an MVP of a very simple application. If it proves to be successful, we can expand and truly employ our creativity. With the current objective, the application will be simple and straightforward.  Now that we know what our scenarios are, in general terms, it is time to properly define each of them. Let us start working on the first one:  Scenario: Book details form should have all fields  Given user is on the books screen Then field bookId exists Then field bookTitle exists Then field bookAuthor exists Then field bookDescription exists  This scenario does not contain any actions; there are no When steps. It can be considered a sanity check. It tells developers what fields should be present in the book form. Through those fields, we can decide what data schema we'll use. IDs are descriptive enough that we know what each field is about  one ID and three text fields . Keep in mind that this scenario  and those that will follow  are pure texts without any code. The main advantage is that anyone can write them, and we'll try to keep it that way.  [ 195 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Let's see what the second scenario should look like:  Scenario: User should be able to create a new book  Given user is on the books screen When user clicks the button newBook When user sets values to the book form When user clicks the button saveBook Then book is stored  This scenario is a bit better formed than the previous one. There is a clear prerequisite  user should be on a certain screen ; there are several actions  click on the newBook button, fill in the form, and click on the saveBook button ; finally, there is the verification of the outcome  book is stored .  The rest of the scenarios are as follows  since they all work in a similar way, we feel that there is no reason to explain each of them separately :  Scenario: User should be able to display book details  Given user is on the books screen When user selects a book Then book form contains all data  Scenario: User should be able to update book details  Given user is on the books screen When user selects a book When user sets values to the book form Then book is stored  Scenario: User should be able to delete a book  Given user is on the books screen When user selects a book When user clicks the deleteBook button Then book is removed  The only thing that might be worth noticing is that we are using the same steps when appropriate  for example, When user selects a book . Since we'll soon try to automate all those scenarios, having the same text for the same step will save us some time by duplicating the code. It is important to strike a balance between the freedom to express scenarios in the best possible way and the ease of automation. There are a few more things that we can modify in our existing scenarios, however, before we refactor them, let us introduce you to JBehave.  [ 196 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  The source code can be found in the 00-story branch of the tdd-java-ch08-books- store Git repository, at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch08-books-store branch 00-story.  JBehave There are two major components required for JBehave to run BDD stories—runners and steps. A runner is a class that will parse the story, run all scenarios, and generate a report. Steps are code methods that match steps written in scenarios. The project already contains all Gradle dependencies, so we can dive right into creating the JBehave runner.  JBehave runner JBehave is no exception to the rule that every type of test needs a runner. In the previous chapters, we used JUnit and TestNG runners. While neither of those needed any special configuration, JBehave is a bit more demanding and forces us to create a class that will hold all the configuration required for running stories.  The following is the Runner code that we'll use throughout this chapter:  public class Runner extends JUnitStories {    @Override   public Configuration configuration   {     return new MostUsefulConfiguration                     .useStoryReporterBuilder getReporter                      .useStoryLoader new LoadFromURL   ;   }    @Override   protected List  storyPaths   {     String path = "stories ** *.story";     return new StoryFinder  .findPaths                  CodeLocations.codeLocationFromPath "" .getFile  ,                 Collections.singletonList path ,                 new ArrayList   ,                 "file:" ;   }    @Override   public InjectableStepsFactory stepsFactory   {     return new InstanceStepsFactory configuration  , new Steps   ;  [ 197 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8    }    private StoryReporterBuilder getReporter   {     return new StoryReporterBuilder          .withPathResolver new FilePrintStreamFactory.ResolveToSimpleName           .withDefaultFormats          .withFormats Format.CONSOLE, Format.HTML ;   } }  It is very uneventful code, so we'll comment only on a few important parts. The overridden method storyPaths has the location to our story files set to the stories ** *.story path. This is a standard Apache Ant  http:  ant.apache.org   syntax that, when translated to plain language, means that any file ending with .story inside the stories directory or any subdirectory  **  will be included. Another important overridden method is stepsFactory, which is used to set classes containing the steps definition  we'll work with them very soon . In this case, we set it to the instance of a single class called Steps  the repository already contains an empty class that we'll use later on .  The source code can be found in the 01-runner branch of the tdd-java-ch08-books- store Git repository, at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch08-books-store branch 01-runner.  Now that we have our runner done, it is time to fire it up and see what the result is.  Pending steps We can run our scenarios with the following Gradle command:  $ gradle clean test  Gradle only runs tasks that changed from the last execution. Since our source code will not always change  we often modify only stories in text format , the clean task is required to be run before the test so that the cache is removed.  JBehave creates a nice report for us and puts it into the target jbehave view directory. Open the reports.html file in your favorite browser.  [ 198 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  The initial page of the report displays a list of our stories  in our case, only Administration  and two predefined ones called BeforeStories and AfterStories. Their purpose is similar to the @BeforeClass and @AfterClass JUnit annotated methods. They are run before and after stories, and can be useful for setting up and tearing down data, servers, and so on.  This initial reports page shows that we have five scenarios and all of them are in the Pending status. This is JBehave's way of telling us that they were neither successful nor failed, but that there is code missing behind the steps we used:  The last column in each row contains a link that allows us to see details of each story:  [ 199 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  In our case, all the steps are marked as pending. JBehave even puts a suggestion of a method that we need to create for each pending step.  To recapitulate, at this point, we wrote one story with five scenarios. Each of those scenarios is equivalent to a specification that will be used both as a definition that should be developed and to verify that the development was done correctly. Each of those scenarios consists of several steps that define preconditions  Given , actions  When , and the expected outcome  Then .  Now it is time, to write the code behind our steps. However, before we start coding, let us get introduced to Selenium and Selenide.  Selenium and Selenide Selenium is a set of drivers that can be used to automate browsers. We can use them to manipulate browsers and page elements by, for example, clicking on a button or a link, filling up a form field, opening a specific URL, and so on. There are drivers for almost any browser—Android, Chrome, FireFox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and many more. Our favorite is PhantomJS, which is a headless browser that works without any UI. Running stories with it is faster than with traditional browsers, and we often use it to get fast feedback on the readiness of web applications. If it works as expected, we can proceed and try it out in all the different browsers and versions that our application is supposed to support.  More information about Selenium can be found at http:  www.seleniumhq.org , with the list of supported drivers at http:  www.seleniumhq.org projects webdriver .  While Selenium is great for automating browsers, it has its downsides, one of them being that it is operating at a very low-level. Clicking on a button, for example, is easy and can be accomplished with a single line of code:  selenium.click "myLink"   If the element with the ID myLink does not exist, Selenium will throw an exception and the test will fail. While we want our tests to fail when the expected element does not exist, in many cases it is not so simple. For example, our page might load dynamically with that element appearing only after an asynchronous request to the server got a response. For this reason, we might not only want to click on that element, but also wait until it is available, and fail only if a timeout is reached. While this can be done with Selenium, it is tedious and error prone. Besides, why would we do the work that is already done by others? Say hello to Selenide.  [ 200 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Selenide  http:  selenide.org   is a wrapper around Selenium WebDrivers with a more concise API, support for Ajax, selectors that use JQuery style, and so on. We'll use Selenide for all our Web steps, and you'll get more familiar with it soon.   Now, let us write some code.  JBehave steps Before we start writing steps, install the PhantomJS browser. The instructions for your operating system can be found at http:  phantomjs.org download.html.  With PhantomJS installed, it is time to specify a few Gradle dependencies:  dependencies {     testCompile 'junit:junit:4.+'     testCompile 'org.jbehave:jbehave-core:3.+'     testCompile 'com.codeborne:selenide:2.+'     testCompile 'com.codeborne:phantomjsdriver:1.+' }  You are already familiar with JUnit and JBehave Core, which was set up earlier. Two new additions are Selenide and PhantomJS. Refresh Gradle dependencies so that they are included in your IDEA project.  Now, it is time to add the PhantomJS WebDriver to our Steps class:  public class Steps {    private WebDriver webDriver;    @BeforeStory   public void beforeStory   {     if  webDriver == null  {       webDriver = new PhantomJSDriver  ;       webDriverRunner.setWebDriver webDriver ;       webDriver.manage  .window  .setSize new Dimension 1024, 768  ;     }   } }  [ 201 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  We're utilizing the @BeforeStory annotation to define the method that we're using to do some basic setup. If a driver is not already specified, we're setting it up to be PhantomJSDriver. Since this application will look different on smaller devices  phones, tablets, and so on , it is important that we specify clearly what the size of the screen is. In this case, we're setting it to be a reasonable desktop laptop monitor screen resolution of 1024 x 768.  With setup out of the way, let us code our first pending step. We can simply copy and paste the first method JBehave suggested for us in the report:  @Given "user is on the books screen"  public void givenUserIsOnTheBooksScreen   {    PENDING }  Imagine that our application will have a link that will open the book's screen. To do that, we'll need to perform two steps:  1. 2.  Open the website home page. Click on the books link in the menu.  We'll specify that this link will have the ID books. IDs are very important as they allow us to easily locate an element on the page.  The steps we described earlier can be translated to the following code:  private String url = "http:  localhost:9001";  @Given "user is on the books screen"  public void givenUserIsOnTheBooksScreen   {   open url ;   $ "books" .click  ; }  We're assuming that our application will run on the 9001 port on the localhost. Therefore, we are first opening the home page URL and then clicking on the element with the ID books. Selenide JQuery syntax for specifying an ID is .  If we run our runner again, we'd see that the first step failed and the rest is still in the Pending state. Now, we are in the red state of the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.  [ 202 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Let us continue working on the rest of the steps used in the first scenario. The second one can be the following:  @Then "field bookId exists"  public void thenFieldBookIdExists   {   $ "books" .shouldBe visible ; }  The third one is almost the same, so we can refactor the previous method and convert an element ID into a variable:  @Then "field $elementId exists"  public void thenFieldExists String elementId  {   $ "" + elementId .shouldBe visible ; }  With this change, all the steps in the first scenario are done. If we run our tests again, the result is the following:  The first step failed since we did not even start working on the implementation of our book store application. Selenide has a nice feature that creates a screenshot of the browser every time there is a failure. We can see the path in the report. The rest of the steps are in the not performed state since the execution of the scenario stopped on failure.  [ 203 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  What should be done next depends on the structure of the team. If the same person is working both on functional tests and the implementation, he could start working on the implementation and write just enough code to make this scenario pass. In many other situations, separate people are working on the functional specification and the implementation code. In that case, one could continue working on the missing steps for the rest of the scenarios, while the other would start working on the implementation. Since all scenarios are already written in text form, a coder already knows what should be done and the two can work in parallel. We'll take the former route and write the code for the rest of the pending steps.  Let's go through the next scenario:  We already have half of the steps done from the previous scenario, so there are only two pending. After we click on the newBook button, we should set some values to the form, click on the saveBook button, and verify that the book was stored correctly. We can do the last part by checking whether it appeared in the list of available books.  The missing steps can be the following:  @When "user sets values to the book form"  public void whenUserSetsValuesToTheBookForm   {   $ "bookId" .setValue "123" ;   $ "bookTitle" .setValue "BDD Assistant" ;   $ "bookAuthor" .setValue "Viktor Farcic" ;   $ "bookDescription"       .setValue "Open source BDD stories editor and runner" ; }  @Then "book is stored"  public void thenBookIsStored   {   $ "book123" .shouldBe present ; }  [ 204 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  The second step assumes that each of the available books will have an ID in the format book[ID].  Let us take a look at the next scenario:  Like in the previous scenario, there are two steps pending development. We need to have a way to select a book and to verify that data in the form is correctly populated:  @When "user selects a book"  public void whenUserSelectsABook   {   $ "book1" .click  ; }  @Then "book form contains all data"  public void thenBookFormContainsAllData   {   $ "bookId" .shouldHave value "1"  ;   $ "bookTitle" .shouldHave value "TDD for Java Developers"  ;   $ "bookAuthor" .shouldHave value "Viktor Farcic"  ;   $ "bookDescription" .shouldHave value "Cool book!"  ; }  [ 205 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  These two methods are interesting because they not only specify the expected behavior  when a specific book link is clicked, then a form with its data is displayed , but also expect certain data to be available for testing. When this scenario is run, a book with the ID 1, title TDD for Java Developers, author Viktor Farcic, and description Cool book! should already exist. We can choose to add that data to the database or use a mock server that will serve the predefined values. No matter what the choice of how to set test data is, we can finish with this scenario and jump into the next one:  The implementation of the pending steps could be the following:  @When "user sets new values to the book form"  public void whenUserSetsNewValuesToTheBookForm   {   $ "bookTitle" .setValue "TDD for Java Developers revised" ;   $ "bookAuthor" .setValue "Viktor Farcic and Alex Garcia" ;   $ "bookDescription" .setValue "Even better book!" ;   $ "saveBook" .click  ; }  @Then "book is updated"  public void thenBookIsUpdated   {   $ "book1" .shouldHave text "TDD for Java Developers revised"  ;   $ "book1" .click  ;   $ "bookTitle" .shouldHave value "TDD for Java Developers revised"  ;   $ "bookAuthor" .shouldHave value "Viktor Farcic and Alex Garcia"  ;   $ "bookDescription" .shouldHave value "Even better book!"  ; }  [ 206 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Finally, there is only one scenario left:  We can verify that a book is removed by verifying that it is not in the list of available books:  @Then "book is removed"  public void thenBookIsRemoved   {   $ "book1" .shouldNotBe visible ; }  We're finished with the steps code. Now, the person who is developing the application not only has requirements but also has a way to validate each behavior  scenario . He can move through the Red-Green-Refactor cycle one scenario at a time.  The source code can be found in the 02-steps branch of the tdd-java-ch08-books- store Git repository: https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch08-books-store branch 02-steps.  Final validation Let us imagine that a different person worked on the code that should fulfill the requirements set by our scenarios. This person picked one scenario at the time, developed the code, ran that scenario, and confirmed that his implementation was correct. Once the implementation of all scenarios has been done, it is time to run the whole story and do the final validation.  For that matter, the application has been packed as a Docker file and we have prepared a virtual machine with Vagrant for executing the application.  [ 207 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  Check out the branch at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-ch08-books-store branch 03-validation and run Vagrant:  $ vagrant up  The output should be similar to the following:  ==> default: Importing base box 'ubuntu trusty64'... ==> default: Matching MAC address for NAT networking... ==> default: Checking if box 'ubuntu trusty64' is up to date... ... ==> default: Running provisioner: docker...     default: Installing Docker  latest  onto machine...     default: Configuring Docker to autostart containers... ==> default: Starting Docker containers... ==> default: -- Container: books-fe  Once Vagrant is finished, we can see the application by opening http:  localhost:9001 in our browser of choice:  Now, let us run our scenarios again:  $ gradle clean test  [ 208 ]   BDD – Working Together with the Whole Team  Chapter 8  This time there were no failures and all scenarios ran successfully:  Once all scenarios are passing, we meet the acceptance criteria and the application can be delivered to production.  Summary BDD, in its essence, is a flavor of TDD. It follows the same basic principle of writing tests  scenarios  before the implementation code. It drives the development and helps to us better understand what should be done.  One of the major differences is the life cycle duration. While with TDD, which is based on unit tests, we're moving from red to green very fast  in minutes if not seconds  BDD often takes a higher-level approach that might require hours or days until we get from the red to the green state. Another important difference is the audience. While unit tests-based TDD is done by developers for developers, BDD intends to involve everyone through its ubiquitous language.  While a whole book can be written on this subject, our intention was to give you just enough information so that you can investigate BDD further.  Now it is time to take a look at legacy code and how to adapt it and make it more TDD friendly.  [ 209 ]   9  Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  TDD may not adjust to legacy code straight away. You may have to fiddle a bit with the steps to make it work. Understand that your TDD may change in this case, because somehow, you are no longer performing the TDD you were used to. This chapter will introduce you to the world of legacy code, taking as much as we can from TDD.   We'll start afresh, with a legacy application that is currently in production. We'll alter it in small ways without introducing defects or regressions, and we'll even have time to have an early lunch!  The following topics are covered in this chapter:  Legacy code Dealing with legacy code REST communication Dependency injection Tests at different levels: end-to-end, integration, and unit   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Legacy code Let's start with the definition of legacy code. While there are many authors with different definitions, such as lack of trust in your application or your tests, code that is no longer supported, and so on. We like the one created by Michael Feathers the most:  "Legacy code is code without tests. The reason for this definition is that it is objective: either there are or there aren't tests."  – Michael Feathers  How do we detect legacy code? Although legacy code usually equates to bad code, Michael Feathers exposes some smells in his book, Working Effectively with Legacy Code, by Dorling Kindersley  India  Pvt. Ltd.  1993 .  Code smell. Smells are certain structures in the code that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality.  Code smells are usually not bugs—they are not technically incorrect and do not currently prevent the program from functioning. Instead, they indicate weaknesses in design that may be slowing down development or increasing the risk of bugs or failures in the future.   Source: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Code_smell.  One of the common smells for legacy code is I can't test this code. It is accessing outside resources, introducing other side effects, using a new operator, and so on. In general, good design is easy to test. Let's see some legacy code.  [ 211 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Legacy code example Software concepts are often easiest to explain through code, and this one is no exception. We have seen and worked with the Tic-Tac-Toe application  see Chapter 3, Red-Green- Refactor – From Failure Through Success until Perfection . The following code performs position validation:  public class TicTacToe {    public void validatePosition int x, int y  {     if  x   3  {       throw new RuntimeException "X is outside board" ;     }     if  y   3  {       throw new RuntimeException "Y is outside board" ;     }   } }  The specification that corresponds with this code is as follows:  public class TicTacToeSpec {   @Rule   public ExpectedException exception =       ExpectedException.none  ;   private TicTacToe ticTacToe;    @Before   public final void before   {     ticTacToe = new TicTacToe  ;   }    @Test   public void whenXOutsideBoardThenRuntimeException   {     exception.expect RuntimeException.class ;     ticTacToe.validatePosition 5, 2 ;   }    @Test   public void whenYOutsideBoardThenRuntimeException   {     exception.expect RuntimeException.class ;     ticTacToe.validatePosition 2, 5 ;   } }  [ 212 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  The JaCoCo report indicates that everything is covered  except the last line, the method's closing bracket :  As we believe we have good coverage, we can perform an automatic and safe refactor  fragment :  public class TicTacToe {    public void validatePosition int x, int y  {     if  isOutsideTheBoard x   {       throw new RuntimeException "X is outside board" ;     }     if  isOutsideTheBoard y   {       throw new RuntimeException "Y is outside board" ;     }   }    private boolean isOutsideTheBoard final int position  {     return position   3;   } }  This code should be ready, as the tests are successful and it has very good test coverage.  [ 213 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Maybe you have already realized as much, but there is a catch. The message in the RuntimeException block is not checked for correctness; even the code coverage shows it as covering all the branches in that line.  What is coverage all about?  Coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested by a particular test suite. Source: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Code_coverage.  Let's imagine a single end-to-end test that covers an easy part of the code. This test will get you a high coverage percentage, but not much security, as there are many other parts that are still not covered. We have already introduced legacy code in our codebase—the exception messages. There might be nothing wrong with this as long as this is not an expected behavior—no one should depend on exception messages, not programmers to debug their programs, or logs, or even users. Those parts of the program that are not covered by tests are likely to suffer regressions in the near future. This might be fine if you accept the risk. Maybe the exception type and the line number are enough.  We have decided to remove the exception message, as it is not tested:  public class TicTacToe {    public void validatePosition int x, int y  {     if  isOutsideTheBoard x   {       throw new RuntimeException "" ;     }     if  isOutsideTheBoard y   {       throw new RuntimeException "" ;     }   }    private boolean isOutsideTheBoard final int position  {     return position   3;   } }  [ 214 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Other ways to recognize legacy code You may be familiar with some of the following common signs of legacy applications:  A patch on top of a patch, just like a living Frankenstein application Known bugs Changes are expensive Fragile Difficult to understand Old, outdated, static or, often, non-existent documentation Shotgun surgery Broken windows  Regarding the team that maintains it, these are some of the effects it produces on the members of the team:  Resignation: The people in charge of the software see a huge task in front of them No one cares anymore: If you already have broken windows in your system, it is easier to introduce new ones  As legacy code is usually more difficult than other kinds of software, you would want your best people to work on it. However, we are often in a hurry imposed by deadlines, with the idea of programming the required functionalities as fast as possible and ignoring the quality of the solution.  Therefore, to avoid wasting our talented developers in such a bad way, we expect a non- legacy application to fulfill just the opposite. It should be:  Easy to change Generalizable, configurable, and expansible Easy to deploy Robust No known defects or limitations Easy to teach to others learn from others Extensive suite of tests Self-validating Able to use keyhole surgery  [ 215 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  As we have outlined some of the properties of legacy and non-legacy code, it should be easy to replace some qualities with others. Right? Stop shotgun surgery and use keyhole surgery, a few more details and you are done. Isn't that right?  It is not as easy as it sounds. Luckily, there are some tricks and rules that, when applied, improve our code and the application comes closer to a non-legacy one.  A lack of dependency injection This is one of the smells often detected in a legacy codebase. As there is no need to test the classes in isolation, the collaborators are instantiated where they are needed, putting the responsibility for creating collaborators and using them in the same class.  Here's an example, using the new operator:  public class BirthdayGreetingService {    private final MessageSender messageSender;    public BirthdayGreetingService   {     messageSender = new EmailMessageSender  ;   }    public void greet final Employee employee  {     messageSender.send employee.getAddress  ,      "Greetings on your birthday" ;   } }  In the current state, the BirthdayGreeting service is not unit-testable. It has the dependency to EmailMessageSender hardcoded in the constructor. It is not possible to replace this dependency without modifying the codebase  except for injecting objects using reflection or replacing objects on the new operator .  Modifying the codebase is always a source of possible regressions, so it should be done with caution. Refactoring requires tests, except when it is not possible.  The Legacy Code Dilemma.   When we change code, we should have tests in place. To put tests in place, we often have to change code.  [ 216 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  The legacy code change algorithm When you have to make a change in a legacy codebase, here is an algorithm you can use:  Identify change points Find test points Break dependencies Write tests Make changes and refactor  Applying the legacy code change algorithm To apply this algorithm, we usually start with a suite of tests and always keep it green while refactoring. This is different from the normal cycle of TDD because refactoring should not introduce any new features  that is, it should not write any new specifications .  To better explain the algorithm, imagine that we received the following change request: To greet my employees in a more informal way, I want to send them a tweet instead of an email.  Identifying change points The system is only able to send emails right now, so a change is necessary. Where? A quick investigation shows that the strategy for sending the greeting is decided in the constructor for the BirthdayGreetingService class following the strategy pattern  https:  en.wikipedia.org ?title=Strategy_pattern :  public class BirthdayGreetingService {    public BirthdayGreetingService   {     messageSender = new EmailMessageSender  ;   }   [...] }  [ 217 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Finding test points As the BirthdayGreetingService class does not have a collaborator injected that could be used to attach additional responsibilities to the object, the only option is to go outside this service class to test it. An option would be to change the EmailMessageSender class for a mock or fake implementation, but this would risk the implementation in that class.  Another option is to create an end-to-end test for this functionality:  public class EndToEndTest {    @Test   public void email_an_employee   {     final StringBuilder systemOutput =        injectSystemOutput  ;     final Employee john = new Employee         new Email "john@example.com"  ;      new BirthdayGreetingService  .greet john ;      assertThat systemOutput.toString  ,       equalTo "Sent email to "         + "'john@example.com' with "         + "the body 'Greetings on your "         + "birthday'\n"  ;   }       This code has been used with permission from     GMaur's LegacyUtils:      https:  github.com GMaur legacyutils   private StringBuilder injectSystemOutput   {     final StringBuilder stringBuilder =       new StringBuilder  ;     final PrintStream outputPrintStream =       new PrintStream          new OutputStream   {         @Override         public void write final int b            throws IOException {           stringBuilder.append  char  b ;         }       } ;     System.setOut outputPrintStream ;     return stringBuilder;   } }  [ 218 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  This code has been used with permission from https:  github.com GMaur legacyutils. This library helps you perform the technique of capturing the system out  System.out .  The name of the file does not end in Specification  or Spec , such as TicTacToeSpec, because this is not a specification. It is a test, to ensure the functionality remains constant. The file has been named EndToEndTest because we try to cover as much functionality as possible.  Breaking dependencies After having created a test that guarantees the expected behavior does not change, we will break the hardcoded dependency between BirthdayGreetingService and EmailMessageSender. For this, we will use a technique called extract and override call, which is first explained in Michael Feathers' book:  public class BirthdayGreetingService {    public BirthdayGreetingService   {     messageSender = getMessageSender  ;   }    private MessageSender getMessageSender   {     return new EmailMessageSender  ;   }  Execute the tests again and verify that the lonely test we previously created still is green. Additionally, we need to make this method protected or more open to be able to override it:  public class BirthdayGreetingService {    protected MessageSender getMessageSender   {     return new EmailMessageSender  ;   }  [...]  [...]  Now that the method can be overridden, we create a fake service to replace the original instance of the service. Introducing fakes in code is a pattern that consists of creating an object that could replace an existing one, with the particularity that we can control its behavior. This way, we can inject some customized fakes to achieve what we need. More information is available at http:  xunitpatterns.com .  [ 219 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  In this particular case, we should create a fake service that extends the original service. The next step is to override complicated methods in order to bypass irrelevant parts of code for testing purposes:  Now we can use the fake, instead of the BirthdayGreetingService class:  public class FakeBirthdayGreetingService  extends BirthdayGreetingService {    @Override   protected MessageSender getMessageSender   {     return new EmailMessageSender  ;   } }  public class EndToEndTest {    @Test   public void email_an_employee   {     final StringBuilder systemOutput =       injectSystemOutput  ;     final Employee john = new Employee         new Email "john@example.com"  ;      new FakeBirthdayGreetingService  .greet john ;      assertThat systemOutput.toString  ,       equalTo "Sent email to "         + "'john@example.com' with "         + "the body 'Greetings on         + "your birthday'\n"  ;   }  The test is still green.  We can now apply another dependency-breaking technique, parameterize constructor, explained in Feathers paper at https: ​ ​archive.​org ​details  WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode. The production code may look like this:  public class BirthdayGreetingService {    public BirthdayGreetingService final MessageSender      messageSender  {     this.messageSender = messageSender;   }   [...] }  [ 220 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Test code that corresponds to this implementation may be as follows:  public class EndToEndTest {    @Test   public void email_an_employee   {     final StringBuilder systemOutput =       injectSystemOutput  ;     final Employee john = new Employee        new Email "john@example.com"  ;      new BirthdayGreetingService new          EmailMessageSender   .greet john ;      assertThat systemOutput.toString  ,       equalTo "Sent email to "         + "'john@example.com' with "         + "the body 'Greetings on "         + "your birthday'\n"  ;   }   [...]  We can also remove FakeBirthday, as it is no longer used.  Writing tests While keeping the old end-to-end test, create an interaction to verify the integration of BirthdayGreetingService and MessageSender:    @Test   public void the_service_should_ask_the_messageSender   {     final Email address =       new Email "john@example.com" ;     final Employee john = new Employee address ;     final MessageSender messageSender =       mock MessageSender.class ;      new BirthdayGreetingService messageSender        .greet john ;      verify messageSender .send address,          "Greetings on your birthday" ;   }  At this point, a new TweetMessageSender can be written, completing the last step of the algorithm.  [ 221 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  The kata exercise The only way a programmer will be able to improve is through practice. Creating programs of different types and using different technologies usually provide a programmer with new insights into software construction. Based on this idea, a kata is an exercise that defines some requirements or fixed features to be implemented in order to achieve some goals.  The programmer is asked to implement a possible solution and then compare it with others trying to find the best. The key value of this exercise is not getting the fastest implementation but discussing decisions taken while designing the solution. In most cases, all programs created in kata are dropped at the end.  The kata exercise in this chapter is about a legacy system. This is a sufficiently simple program to be processed in this chapter but also complex enough to pose some difficulties.  Legacy kata You have been given a task to adopt a system that is already in production, a working piece of software for a book library: the Alexandria project.  The project currently lacks documentation, and the old maintainer is no longer available for discussion. So, should you accept this mission, it is going to be entirely your responsibility, as there is no one else to rely on.  Description We have been able to recover these specification snippets from the time the original project was written:  The Alexandria software should be able to store books and lend them to users, who have the power to return them. The user can also query the system for books, by author, book title, status, and ID. There is no time frame for returning the books. The books can also be censored as this is considered important for business reasons. The software should not accept new users. The user should be told, at any moment, the server's time.  [ 222 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Technical comments The Alexandria is a backend project written in Java, which communicates information to the frontend using a REST API. For the purpose of this kata exercise,  persistence has been implemented as an in-memory object, using the fake test double explained at http:  xunitpatterns.com Fake%20Object.html.  The code is available at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-alexandria.  Adding a new feature Until the point of adding a new feature, the legacy code might not be a disturbance to the programmer's productivity. The codebase is in a state that is worse than desired, but the production systems work without any inconvenience.  Now is the time when the problems start to appear. The product owner  PO  wants to add a new feature.  For example, as a library manager, I want to know all the history for a given book so that I can measure which books are more in demand than others.  Black-box or spike testing As the old maintainer of the Alexandria project is no longer available for questions and there is no documentation, black-box testing is more difficult. Thus, we decide to get to know the software better through investigation and then doing some spikes that will leak internal knowledge to us about the system.  We will later use this knowledge to implement the new feature.  Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. This type of test can be applied to virtually every level of software testing: unit, integration, system, and acceptance. It typically most if not all higher-level testing, but can dominate unit testing as well.   Source: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Black-box_testing.   [ 223 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Preliminary investigation When we know the required feature, we will start looking at the Alexandria project:  15 files Gradle-based  build.gradle  0 tests  Firstly, we want to confirm that this project has never been tested, and the lack of a test folder reveals so:      $ find src test     find: src test: No such file or directory  These are the folder contents for the Java part:      $ cd src main java com packtpublishing tddjava ch09 alexandria      $ find .     .     . Book.java     . Books.java     . BooksEndpoint.java     . BooksRepository.java     . CustomExceptionMapper.java     . MyApplication.java     . States.java     . User.java     . UserRepository.java     . Users.java  Here is the rest:      $ cd src main     $ find resources webapp     resources     resources applicationContext.xml     webapp     webapp WEB-INF     webapp WEB-INF web.xml  This seems to be a web project  indicated by the web.xml file  using Spring  indicated by the applicationContext.xml . The dependencies in the build.gradle show the following  fragment :  compile 'org.springframework:spring-web:4.1.4.RELEASE'  [ 224 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Having Spring is already a good sign, as it can help with the dependency injection, but a quick look showed that the context is not really being used. Maybe something that was used in the past?  In the web.xml file, we can find this fragment:    <web-app version="3.0" xmlns="http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee"          xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"          xsi:schemaLocation="http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee           http:  java.sun.com xml ns javaee web-app_3_0.xsd">       alexandria                  contextConfigLocation           classpath:applicationContext.xml                        SpringApplication             org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer                         javax.ws.rs.Application              <param- value>com.packtpublishing.tddjava.alexandria.MyApplication< param- value>                    1         In this file, we discover the following:  The context in applicationContext.xml will be loaded There is an application file  com.packtpublishing.tddjava.alexandria.MyApplication  that will be executed inside a servlet  [ 225 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  The MyApplication file is as follows:  public class MyApplication extends ResourceConfig {    public MyApplication   {     register RequestContextFilter.class ;     register BooksEndpoint.class ;     register JacksonJaxbJsonProvider.class ;     register CustomExceptionMapper.class ;   } }  This configures the necessary classes for executing the BooksEndpoint endpoint  fragment :  @Path "books"  @Component public class BooksEndpoint {   private BooksRepository books = new BooksRepository  ;    private UserRepository users = new UserRepository  ;  In this last snippet, we can find one of the first indicators that this is a legacy codebase—both dependencies  books and users  are created inside the endpoint and not injected. This makes unit testing more difficult.  We can start by writing down the element that will be used during refactoring; we write the code for the dependency injection in BooksEndpoint.  How to find candidates for refactoring There are different paradigms of programming  for example, functional, imperative, and object-oriented  and styles  for example, compact, verbose, minimalistic, and too clever . Therefore, the candidates for refactoring are different from one person to the other.  There is another way, as opposed to subjectively, of finding candidates for refactoring—objectively. There are many papers investigating how to find candidates for refactoring objectively. This is just an introduction and it is left to the reader to learn more about these techniques.  [ 226 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Introducing the new feature After getting to know the code more, it seems that the most important functional change is to replace the current status  fragment :  @XmlRootElement public class Book {    private final String title;   private final String author;   private int status;   <- this attribute   private int id;  And replace it with a collection of them  fragment :  @XmlRootElement public class Book {   private int[] statuses;      ...  This might seem to work  after changing all access to the field to the array, for example , but this also prompts a functional requirement.  The Alexandria software should be able to store books and lend them to users who have the power to return them. The user can also query the system for books, by author, book title, status, and ID.  The PO confirms that searching books via status has now changed now, it also allows  searching for any previous status.  This change is getting bigger and bigger. Whenever we feel that the time for removing this legacy code has come, we start applying the legacy code algorithm.  We have also detected a primitive obsession and feature envy smell: storing the status as an integer  primitive obsession  and then actuating on another object's state  feature envy . We will add this to the following to-do list:  Dependency injection in BooksEndpoint for books Change status for statuses Remove the primitive obsession with status  optional   [ 227 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Applying the legacy code algorithm In this case, the whole middle-end works as a standalone, using in-memory persistence. The same algorithm could be used if the persistence was saved into a database, but we would require some extra code to clean and populate the database between test runs.  We'll use DbUnit. More information can be found at http:  dbunit.sourceforge.net .  Writing end-to-end test cases The first step we've decided to take to ensure that behavior is maintained during refactoring is to write end-to-end tests. In other applications that include frontends, this could be using a higher-level tool, such as Selenium Selenide.  In our case, as the frontend is not subject to refactoring, the tool can be lower-level. We have chosen to write HTTP requests for the purpose of end-to-end tests.  These requests should be automatic and testable, and should follow all existing rules for automatic tests or specifications. As we were discovering the real application behavior while writing these tests, we have decided to write a spike in a tool called Postman.  The product website is here: https:  www.getpostman.com . This is also possible with a tool called curl  http:  curl.haxx.se  .  What is curl?   curl is a command-line tool and library for transferring data with URL syntax, supporting [...] HTTP, HTTPS, [...], HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, and [...].  What's curl used for? curl is used in command lines or scripts to transfer data.  Source: http:  curl.haxx.se .  To do this, we decide to execute the legacy software locally with the following line:  . gradlew clean jettyRun  This fires up a local jetty server that processes requests. The big benefit is that deployment is done automatically and there is no need to package everything and manually deploy to an application server  for example, JBoss AS, GlassFish, Geronimo, and TomEE . This can greatly speed up the process of making changes and seeing the effects, therefore decreasing the feedback lead time. Later on, we will start the server programmatically from Java code.  [ 228 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  We start looking for functionalities. As we discovered earlier that the BooksEndpoint class contains the webservice endpoint definitions, this is a good place to start looking for functionalities. They are listed as follows:  1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.  Add a new book List all the books Search for books by ID, by author, by title, and by status Prepare this book to be rented Rent this book Censor this book Uncensor the book  We launch the server manually and start writing requests:  [ 229 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  These tests seem good enough for a spike. One thing that we have realized is that each response contains a timestamp, so this makes our automation more difficult:  For the tests to have more value, they should be automated and exhaustive. For the moment, they are not, so we consider them spikes. They will be automated in the future.  [ 230 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Each and every single test that we perform is not automated. In this case, the tests from the Postman interface are much faster to write than the automated ones. Also, the experience is far more representative of what production use would be like. The test client  thankfully, in this case  could introduce some problems with the production one, and therefore not return trusted results.   In this particular case, we have found that the Postman tests are a better investment because, even after writing them, we will throw them away. They give very rapid feedback on the API and results. We also use this tool for prototyping the REST APIs, as its tools are both effective and useful.   The general idea here is this: depending on whether you want to save those tests for the future or not, use one tool or another. This also depends on how often you want to execute them, and in which environment.  After writing down all the requests, these are the states that we have found in the application, represented by a state diagram:  After these tests are ready and we start to understand the application, it is time to automate the tests. After all, if they are not automated, we don't really feel confident enough for refactoring.  [ 231 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Automating the test cases We start the server programmatically. For this, we have decided to use a Grizzly  https: ​  javaee.​github.​io ​grizzly ​ , which allows us to start the server using the configuration from Jersey's ResourceConfig  FQCN: org.glassfish.jersey.server.ResourceConfig , as shown in the test BooksEndpointTest  fragment .  The code can be found at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-alexandria:  public class BooksEndpointTest {     public static final URI FULL_PATH =       URI.create "http:  localhost:8080 alexandria" ;     private HttpServer server;      @Before     public void setUp   throws IOException {         ResourceConfig resourceConfig =           new MyApplication  ;         server = GrizzlyHttpServerFactory           .createHttpServer FULL_PATH, resourceConfig ;         server.start  ;     }      @After     public void tearDown  {         server.shutdownNow  ;     }  This prepares a local server at the address http:  localhost:8080 alexandria. It will only be available for a short period of time  while the tests run , so, if you need to manually access the server, whenever you want to pause the execution, insert a call to the following method:  public void pauseTheServer   throws Exception {     System.in.read  ; }  When you want to stop the server, stop the execution or hit Enter in the allocated console.  Now we can start the server programmatically, pause it  with the preceding method , and execute the spike again. The results are the same, so the refactor is successful.  We add the first automated test to the system.  [ 232 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  The code can be found at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-alexandria:  public class BooksEndpointTest {     public static final String AUTHOR_BOOK_1 =      "Viktor Farcic and Alex Garcia";     public static final String TITLE_BOOK_1 =       "TDD in Java";     private final Map  TDD_IN_JAVA;      public BooksEndpointTest   {       TDD_IN_JAVA = getBookProperties TITLE_BOOK_1,         AUTHOR_BOOK_1 ;     }      private Map  getBookProperties        String title, String author  {         Map  bookProperties =           new HashMap   ;         bookProperties.put "title", title ;         bookProperties.put "author", author ;         return bookProperties;     }      @Test     public void add_one_book   throws IOException {         final Response books1 = addBook TDD_IN_JAVA ;         assertBooksSize books1, is "1"  ;     }       private void assertBooksSize Response response,         Matcher  matcher  {         response.then  .body matcher ;     }      private Response addBook        Map  bookProperties  {         return RestAssured             .given  .log  .path               .contentType ContentType.URLENC              .parameters bookProperties              .post "books" ;     }  For testing purposes, we're using a library called RestAssured  https: ​ ​github.​com  rest-​assured ​rest-​assured  that allows for easier testing of REST and JSON.  [ 233 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  To complete the automated test suite, we create these tests:  add_one_book    add_a_second_book    get_book_details_by_id    get_several_books_in_a_row    censor_a_book    cannot_retrieve_a_censored_book    The code can be found at https:  bitbucket.org vfarcic tdd-java-alexandria .  Now that we have a suite that ensures that no regression is introduced, we take a look at the following to-do list:  1. 2. 3.  Dependency injection in BooksEndpoint for books Change status for statuses Remove the primitive obsession with status  optional   We will tackle dependency injection first.  Injecting the BookRepository dependency The code for the BookRepository dependency is in BooksEndpoint  fragment :  @Path "books"  @Component public class BooksEndpoint {      private BooksRepository books =       new BooksRepository  ; [...]  Extract and override call We will apply the already introduced refactoring technique extract and override call. For this, we create a failing specification, as shown here:  @Test public void add_one_book   throws IOException {     addBook TDD_IN_JAVA ;  [ 234 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9      Book tddInJava = new Book TITLE_BOOK_1,       AUTHOR_BOOK_1,        States.fromValue 1  ;      verify booksRepository .add tddInJava ; }  To pass this red specification, also known as a failing specificiation, we will first extract the dependency creation to a protected method in the BookRepository class:  @Path "books"  @Component public class BooksEndpoint {      private BooksRepository books =       getBooksRepository  ;      [...]      [...]       protected BooksRepository        getBooksRepository   {         return new BooksRepository  ;     }  We copy the MyApplication launcher to this:  public class TestApplication     extends ResourceConfig {      public TestApplication        BooksEndpoint booksEndpoint  {         register booksEndpoint ;         register RequestContextFilter.class ;         register JacksonJaxbJsonProvider.class ;         register CustomExceptionMapper.class ;     }      public TestApplication   {         this new BooksEndpoint            new BooksRepository    ;     } }  [ 235 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  This allows us to inject any BooksEndpoint. In this case, in the test BooksEndpointInteractionTest, we will override the dependency getter with a mock. In this way, we can check that the necessary calls are being made  fragment from BooksEndpointInteractionTest :  @Test public void add_one_book   throws IOException {     addBook TDD_IN_JAVA ;     verify booksRepository        .add new Book TITLE_BOOK_1,           AUTHOR_BOOK_1, 1  ; }  Run the tests; everything is green. Even though the specifications are successful, we have introduced a piece of design only for test purposes, and the production code is not executing this new launcher, TestApplication, but is still executing the old MyApplication. To solve this, we have to unify both launchers into one. This can be solved with the refactor parametrize constructor, also explained in Roy Osherove's book, The Art of Unit Testing  http:  artofunittesting.com .  Parameterizing a constructor We can unify the launchers by accepting a BooksEndpoint dependency. If we don't specify it, it will register the dependency with the real instance of BooksRepository. Otherwise, it will register the received one:  public class MyApplication       extends ResourceConfig {      public MyApplication   {         this new BooksEndpoint            new BooksRepository    ;     }      public MyApplication        BooksEndpoint booksEndpoint  {         register booksEndpoint ;         register RequestContextFilter.class ;         register JacksonJaxbJsonProvider.class ;         register CustomExceptionMapper.class ;     } }  In this case, we have opted for constructor chaining to avoid repetition in the constructors.  [ 236 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  After doing this refactor, the BooksEndpointInteractionTest class is as follows in its final state:  public class BooksEndpointInteractionTest {      public static final URI FULL_PATH = URI.         create "http:  localhost:8080 alexandria" ;     private HttpServer server;     private BooksRepository booksRepository;      @Before     public void setUp   throws IOException {         booksRepository = mock BooksRepository.class ;         BooksEndpoint booksEndpoint =           new BooksEndpoint booksRepository ;         ResourceConfig resourceConfig =           new MyApplication booksEndpoint ;         server = GrizzlyHttpServerFactory            .createHttpServer FULL_PATH, resourceConfig ;         server.start  ;     }  The first test passed, so we can mark the dependency injection task as done.

As a library manager, I want to know all the history for a given book so that I can measure which books are more in demand than others.  We will start with a red specification:  public class BooksSpec {      @Test  [ 237 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9      public void should_search_for_any_past_state   {         Book book1 = new Book "title", "author",            States.AVAILABLE ;         book1.censor  ;          Books books = new Books  ;         books.add book1 ;          String available =           String.valueOf States.AVAILABLE ;         assertThat            books.filterByState available .isEmpty  ,            is false  ;     } }  Run all the tests and see the last one fail.  Implement the search on all states  fragment :  public class Book {      private ArrayList  status;      public Book String title, String author, int status  {         this.title = title;         this.author = author;         this.status = new ArrayList   ;         this.status.add status ;     }      public int getStatus   {         return status.get status.size  -1 ;     }       public void rent   {         status.add States.RENTED ;     }     [...]      public List  anyState   {         return status;     }     [...]  [ 238 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  In this fragment, we have omitted the irrelevant parts—things that were not modified, or more modifier methods, such as rent, that have changed the implementation in the same fashion:  public class Books {     public Books filterByState String state  {         Integer expectedState = Integer.valueOf state ;         return new Books              new ConcurrentLinkedQueue                   books.stream                     .filter x                  -> x.anyState                     .contains expectedState                     .collect toList     ;     }     [...]  The outside methods, especially the serialization to JSON, are not affected, as the getStatus method still returns an int value.  We run all the tests and everything is green.  Tasks performed:  Dependency injection in BooksEndpoint for books Change status for statuses  The to-do list:  Remove the primitive obsession with status  optional   Removing the primitive obsession with status as int We have decided to also tackle the optional item in our to-do list.  The to-do list:  Dependency injection in BooksEndpoint for books Change status for statuses Remove the primitive obsession with status  optional   [ 239 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  The smell: Primitive obsession involves using primitive data types to represent domain ideas. For example, we use a string to represent a message, an integer to represent an amount of money, or a struct dictionary hash to represent a specific object.   The source is http:  c2.com cgi wiki?PrimitiveObsession.  As this is a refactor step  that is, we are not introducing any new behavior into the system , we don't need any new specification. We will proceed and try to always stay green, or leave it for as little time as possible.  We have converted  States from a Java class with constants:  public class States {     public static final int BOUGHT = 1;     public static final int RENTED = 2;     public static final int AVAILABLE = 3;     public static final int CENSORED = 4; }  And turned it into an enum:  enum States {     BOUGHT  1 ,     RENTED  2 ,     AVAILABLE  3 ,     CENSORED  4 ;      private final int value;      private States int value  {         this.value = value;     }      public int getValue   {         return value;     }      public static States fromValue int value  {         for  States states : values    {             if states.getValue   == value  {                 return states;             }         }         throw new IllegalArgumentException            "Value '" + value  [ 240 ]   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9      + "' could not be found in States" ;     } }  Adapt the tests as follows:  public class BooksEndpointInteractionTest {     @Test     public void add_one_book   throws IOException {         addBook TDD_IN_JAVA ;         verify booksRepository .add              new Book TITLE_BOOK_1, AUTHOR_BOOK_1,               States.BOUGHT  ;     }     [...] public class BooksTest {      @Test     public void should_search_for_any_past_state   {         Book book1 = new Book "title", "author",            States.AVAILABLE ;         book1.censor  ;          Books books = new Books  ;         books.add book1 ;          assertThat books.filterByState              String.valueOf                States.AVAILABLE.getValue                 .isEmpty  , is false  ;     }     [...]  @XmlRootElement public class Books {       public Books filterByState String state  {         State expected =           States.fromValue Integer.valueOf state  ;         return new Books              new ConcurrentLinkedQueue                   books.stream                     .filter x -> x.anyState                       .contains expected                     .collect toList     ;     }     [...]  [ 241 ]  Adapt the production code. The code snippet is as follows:   Refactoring Legacy Code – Making It Young Again  Chapter 9  Also the following:  @XmlRootElement public class Book {      private final String title;     private final String author;     @XmlTransient     private ArrayList  status;     private int id;      public Book        String title, String author, States status  {         this.title = title;         this.author = author;         this.status = new ArrayList   ;         this.status.add status ;     }      public States getStatus   {         return status.get status.size   - 1 ;     }      @XmlElement name = "status"      public int getStatusAsInteger  {         return getStatus  .getValue  ;     }      public List  anyState   {         return status;     }     [...]  In this case, the serialization has been done using the annotation:  @XmlElement name = "status"   This converts the result of the method into the field named status.  Also, the status field, now ArrayList , is marked with @XmlTransient so it is not serialized to JSON.  We execute all the tests and they are green, so we can now cross off the optional element in our to-do list.

We stated that legacy code is code without tests, so the first step in dealing with it is to create tests to help you preserve the same functionality during the process. Unfortunately, creating tests is not always as easy as it sounds. Many times, legacy code is tightly coupled and presents other symptoms that show a poor design or at least a lack of interest in the code's quality in the past. Worry not: you can perform some of the tedious tasks step by step, as shown in http:  martinfowler.com bliki ParallelChange.html. Moreover, it is also well known that software development is a learning process. Working code is a side effect. Therefore, the most important part is to learn more about the codebase, to be able to modify it with security. Please visit http:  www.slideshare.net ziobrando model-storming for more information.  Finally, we encourage you to read Michael Feathers book called Working Effectively with Legacy Code. It has plenty of techniques for this kind of codebase, and as a result is very useful for understanding the whole process.  [ 243 ]   10  Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  "Do not let circumstances control you. You change your circumstances."  – Jackie Chan  We have seen so far how TDD makes the development process easier and decreases the amount of time spent on writing quality code. But there's another particular benefit to this. As code is being tested and its correctness is proven, we can go a step further and assume that our code is production-ready once all tests have passed.  There are some software life cycle approaches based on this idea. Some extreme programming  XP  practices such as continuous integration  CI , continuous delivery, and continuous deployment  CD  will be introduced. The code examples can be found at https: ​ ​bitbucket.​org ​alexgarcia ​packt-​tdd-​java ​src ​, in the folder 10-feature- toggles.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  Continuous integration, delivery, and deployment Testing the application in production Feature Toggles   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  Continuous integration, delivery, and deployment TDD goes hand in hand with CI, continuous delivery, or CD. Differences aside, all three techniques have similar goals. They are all trying to foster the continuous verification of production readiness of our code. In that respect, they are very similar to TDD. They each promote very short development cycles, continuous verification of the code we're producing, and the intention to continuously keep our application in a production-ready state.  The scope of this book does not permit us to go into the details of those techniques. Indeed, a whole book could be written on this subject. We'll just briefly explain the differences between the three. Practicing CI means that our code is at  almost  all times integrated with the rest of the system, and if there is a problem it will surface quickly. If such a thing happens, the priority is to fix the cause of that problem, meaning that any new development must take lower priority. You might have noticed a similarity between this definition and the way TDD works. The major difference is that with TDD, our primary focus is not the integration with the rest of the system. The rest is the same. Both TDD and CI try to detect problems fast and treat fixing them as the highest priority, putting everything else on hold. CI does not have the whole pipeline automated, and additional manual verifications are needed before the code is deployed to production.  Continuous delivery is very similar to CI, except that the former goes a bit further and has the whole pipeline automated, except the actual deployment to production. Every push to the repository that passed all verifications is considered valid for deployment to production. However, the decision to deploy is made manually. Someone needs to choose one of the builds and promote it to the production environment. The choice is political or functional. It depends on what and when we want our users to receive, even though each is production-ready.  "Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time."  – Martin Fowler  Finally, CD is accomplished when the decision about what to deploy is automated as well. In this scenario, every commit that passed all verifications is deployed to production—no exceptions.  [ 245 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  In order to continuously integrate or deliver our code to production, branches cannot exist, or the time between creating them and integrating them with the mainline must be very short  less than a day, preferably a few hours . If that is not the case, we are not continuously verifying our code.  The true connection with TDD comes from the necessity to create validations before the code is committed. If those verifications are not created in advance, code pushed to the repository is not accompanied with tests and the process fails. Without tests, there is no confidence in what we did. Without TDD, there are no tests to accompany our implementation code. Alternatively, a delay in pushing commits to repository until tests are created but in that case, there is no continuous part of the process. Code is sitting on someone's computer until someone else is finished with tests. Code that sits somewhere is not continuously verified against the whole system.  To summarize, continuous integration, delivery, and deployment rely on tests to accompany the integration code  thus, relying on TDD  and on the practice of not using branches or having them very short-lived  very often merged to the mainline . The problem lies with the fact that some features cannot be developed that fast. No matter how small our features are, in some cases it might take days to develop them. During all that time, we cannot push to the repository because the process would deliver them to production. Users do not want to see partial features. There is no point having, for example, part of the login process delivered. If one were to see a login page with a username, password, and login button, but the process behind that button does not actually store that info and provides, let's say, an authentication cookie, then at best we would have confused the users. In some other cases, one feature cannot work without the other. Following the same example, even if a login feature is fully developed, without registration it is pointless. One cannot be used without the other.  Imagine playing a puzzle. We need to have a rough idea of the final picture, but we are focused on one piece at the time. We pick a piece that we think is the easiest to place and combine it with its neighbors. Only when all of them are in place is the picture complete and we are finished.  The same applies to TDD. We develop our code by being focused on small units. As we progress, they start taking a shape and working with each other until they are all integrated. While we're waiting for that to happen, even though all our tests are passing and we are in a green state, the code is not ready for the end users.  The easiest way to solve those problems and not compromise on TDD and CI CD is to use Feature Toggles.  [ 246 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  Feature Toggles You might have also heard about this as Feature Flipping or Feature Flags. No matter  which expression we use, they are all based on a mechanism that permits you to turn on and off the features of your application. This is very useful when all code is merged into one branch and you must deal with partially finished  or integrated  code. With this technique, unfinished features can be hidden so that users cannot access them.  Due to its nature, there are other possible uses for this functionality. As a circuit breaker when something is wrong with a particular feature, providing graceful degradation of the application, shutting down secondary features to preserve hardware resources for business core operations, and so on. Feature Toggles, in some cases, can go even further. We might use them to enable features only to certain users, based on, for example, geographic location or their role. Another use is that we can enable new features for our testers only. That way, end users would continue to be oblivious of the existence of some new features, while testers would be able to validate them on a production server.  Moreover, there are some aspects to remember when using Feature Toggles:  Use toggles only until they are fully deployed and proven to work. Otherwise, you might end up with spaghetti code full of if else statements containing old toggles that are not in use any more. Do not spend too much time testing toggles. It is, in most cases, enough to confirm that the entry point into some new feature is not visible. That can be, for example, a link to the new feature. Do not overuse toggles. Do not use them when there is no need for them. For example, you might be developing a new screen that is accessible through a link in the home page. If that link is added at the end, there might be no need to have a toggle that hides it.  There are many good frameworks and libraries for application feature handling. Two of  them are the following:  Togglz  http:  www.togglz.org   FF4J  http:  ff4j.org    These libraries offer a sophisticated way to manage features, even adding role-based or rules-based feature access. In many cases, you aren't going to need it, but these capabilities bring us the possibility of testing a new feature in production without opening it to all users. However, implementing a custom basic solution for feature toggling is quite simple, and we are going to go through an example to illustrate this.  [ 247 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  A Feature Toggle example Here we go with our demo application. This time, we're going to build a simple and small REpresentational State Transfer  REST   service to compute, on demand, a concrete Nth position of Fibonacci's sequence. We will keep track of enabled disabled features using a file. For simplicity, we will use Spring Boot as our framework of choice and Thymeleaf as a template engine. This is also included in the Spring Boot dependency. Find more information about Spring Boot and related projects at http:  projects.spring.io spring-boot . Also, you can visit http:  www.thymeleaf.org  to read more about the template engine.  This is how the build.gradle file looks:  apply plugin: 'java' apply plugin: 'application'  sourceCompatibility = 1.8 version = '1.0' mainClassName = "com.packtpublishing.tddjava.ch09.Application"  repositories {     mavenLocal       mavenCentral   }  dependencies {     compile group: 'org.springframework.boot',             name: 'spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf',             version: '1.2.4.RELEASE'      testCompile group: 'junit',     name: 'junit',     version: '4.12' }  Note that application plugin is present because we want to run the application using the Gradle command run. Here is the application's main class:  @SpringBootApplication public class Application {     public static void main String[] args  {         SpringApplication.run Application.class, args ;     } }  [ 248 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  We will create the properties file. This time, we are going to use YAML Ain't Markup Language  YAML  format, as it is very comprehensive and concise. Add a file called application.yml in the src main resources folder, with the following content:  features:     fibonacci:         restEnabled: false  Spring offers a way to load this kind of property file automatically. Currently, there are only two restrictions: the name must be application.yml and or the file should be included in the application's class path.  This is our implementation of the feature's config file:  @Configuration @EnableConfigurationProperties @ConfigurationProperties prefix = "features.fibonacci"  public class FibonacciFeatureConfig {     private boolean restEnabled;      public boolean isRestEnabled   {         return restEnabled;     }      public void setRestEnabled boolean restEnabled  {         this.restEnabled = restEnabled;     } }  This is the fibonacci service class. This time, the computation operation will always return -1, just to simulate a partially done feature:  @Service "fibonacci"  public class FibonacciService {      public int getNthNumber int n  {         return -1;     } }  We also need a wrapper to hold the computed values:  public class FibonacciNumber {     private final int number, value;      public FibonacciNumber int number, int value  {         this.number = number;  [ 249 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10          this.value = value;     }      public int getNumber   {         return number;     }      public int getValue   {         return value;     } }  This is the FibonacciRESTController class, responsible for handling the fibonacci service queries:  @RestController public class FibonacciRestController {     @Autowired     FibonacciFeatureConfig fibonacciFeatureConfig;      @Autowired     @Qualifier "fibonacci"      private FibonacciService fibonacciProvider;      @RequestMapping value = " fibonacci", method = GET      public FibonacciNumber fibonacci              @RequestParam                      value = "number",                     defaultValue = "0"  int number  {         if  fibonacciFeatureConfig.isRestEnabled    {             int fibonacciValue = fibonacciProvider                     .getNthNumber number ;             return new FibonacciNumber number, fibonacciValue ;         } else throw new UnsupportedOperationException  ;     }      @ExceptionHandler UnsupportedOperationException.class      public void unsupportedException HttpServletResponse response              throws IOException {         response.sendError                  HttpStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE.value  ,                 "This feature is currently unavailable"          ;     }      @ExceptionHandler Exception.class      public void handleGenericException   [ 250 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10              HttpServletResponse response,             Exception e  throws IOException {         String msg = "There was an error processing " +                 "your request: " + e.getMessage  ;         response.sendError                  HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.value  ,                 msg          ;     } }  Note that the fibonacci method is checking whether the fibonacci service should be enabled or disabled, throwing an UnsupportedOperationException for convenience in the last case. There are also two error-handling functions; the first one is for processing UnsupportedOperationException and the second is for generic exceptions handling.  Now that all the components have been set, all we need to do is execute Gradle's run command:      $> gradle run  The command will launch a process that will eventually set a server up on the following address: http:  localhost:8080. This can be observed in the console output:      ...     2015-06-19 03:44:54.157  INFO 3886 --- [           main] o.s.w.s.handler.SimpleUrlHandlerMapping  : Mapped URL path [ webjars **] onto handler of type [class org.springframework.web.servlet.resource.ResourceHttpRequestHandler]     2015-06-19 03:44:54.160  INFO 3886 --- [           main] o.s.w.s.handler.SimpleUrlHandlerMapping  : Mapped URL path [ **] onto handler of type [class org.springframework.web.servlet.resource.ResourceHttpRequestHandler]     2015-06-19 03:44:54.319  INFO 3886 --- [           main] o.s.w.s.handler.SimpleUrlHandlerMapping  : Mapped URL path [ ** favicon.ico] onto handler of type [class org.springframework.web.servlet.resource.ResourceHttpRequestHandler]     2015-06-19 03:44:54.495  INFO 3886 --- [           main] o.s.j.e.a.AnnotationMBeanExporter        : Registering beans for JMX exposure on startup     2015-06-19 03:44:54.649  INFO 3886 --- [           main] s.b.c.e.t.TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer : Tomcat started on port s : 8080  http      2015-06-19 03:44:54.654  INFO 3886 --- [           main] c.p.tddjava.ch09.Application             : Started Application in 6.916 seconds  JVM running for 8.558      > Building 75% > :run  [ 251 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  Once the application has started, we can perform a query using a regular browser. The URL of the query is http:  localhost:8080 fibonacci?number=7.  This gives us the following output:  As you can see, the error received corresponds to the error sent by the REST API when the feature is disabled. Otherwise, the return should be -1.  Implementing the Fibonacci service Most of you might be familiar with Fibonacci's numbers. Here's a brief explanation anyway for those who don't know what they are.  Fibonacci's sequence is an integer sequence resulting from the recurrence f n  = f n-1  - f n - 2 . The sequence starts with being f 0  = 0 and f 1  = 1. All other numbers are generated applying the recurrence as many times as needed until a value substitution can be performed using either 0 or 1 known values.  That is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,...  More info about Fibonacci's sequence can be found here: http:  www.wolframalpha.com input ?i=fibonacci+sequence  As an extra functionality, we want to limit how long the value computation takes, so we impose a constraint on the input; our service will only compute Fibonacci's numbers from 0 to 30  both numbers included .  [ 252 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  This is a possible implementation of a class computing Fibonacci's numbers:  @Service "fibonacci"  public class FibonacciService {     public static final int LIMIT = 30;      public int getNthNumber int n  {         if  isOutOfLimits n  {         throw new IllegalArgumentException          "Requested number must be a positive " +            number no bigger than " + LIMIT ;         if  n == 0  return 0;         if  n == 1  n == 2  return 1;         int first, second = 1, result = 1;         do {             first = second;             second = result;             result = first + second;             --n;         } while  n > 2 ;         return result;     }      private boolean isOutOfLimits int number  {         return number > LIMIT  number < 0;     } }  For the sake of brevity, the TDD Red-Green-Refactor process is not explicitly explained in the demonstration, but has been present through development. Only the final implementation with the final tests is presented:  public class FibonacciServiceTest {     private FibonacciService tested;     private final String expectedExceptionMessage =          "Requested number " +             "must be a positive number no bigger than " +             FibonacciService.LIMIT;      @Rule     public ExpectedException exception = ExpectedException.none  ;      @Before     public void beforeTest   {         tested = new FibonacciService  ;     }  [ 253 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10      @Test     public void test0   {         int actual = tested.getNthNumber 0 ;         assertEquals 0, actual ;     }      @Test     public void test1   {         int actual = tested.getNthNumber 1 ;         assertEquals 1, actual ;     }      @Test     public void test7   {         int actual = tested.getNthNumber 7 ;         assertEquals 13, actual ;     }      @Test     public void testNegative   {         exception.expect IllegalArgumentException.class ;         exception.expectMessage is expectedExceptionMessage  ;         tested.getNthNumber -1 ;     }      @Test     public void testOutOfBounce   {         exception.expect IllegalArgumentException.class ;         exception.expectMessage is expectedExceptionMessage  ;         tested.getNthNumber 31 ;     } }  Also, we can now turn on the fibonacci feature in the application.yml file, perform some queries with the browser, and check how is it going:  features:     fibonacci:         restEnabled: true  Execute Gradle's run command:      $>gradle run  [ 254 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  Now we can fully test our REST API using the browser, with a number between 0 and 30:  Then, we test it with a number bigger than 30, and lastly by introducing characters instead of numbers:  Working with the template engine We are enabling and disabling the fibonacci feature, but there are many other cases where the Feature Toggle can be very useful. One of them is hiding a web link that links to an unfinished feature. This is an interesting use because we can test what we released to production using its URL, but it will be hidden for the rest of the users for as long as we want.  To illustrate this behavior, we are going to create a simple web page using the already mentioned Thymeleaf framework.  First of all, we add a new control flag:  features:     fibonacci:         restEnabled: true         webEnabled: true  [ 255 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  Next, map this new flag in a configuration class:      private boolean webEnabled;     public boolean isWebEnabled   {         return webEnabled;     }      public void setWebEnabled boolean webEnabled  {         this.webEnabled = webEnabled;     }  We are going to create two templates. The first one is the home page. It contains some links to different Fibonacci number computations. These links should be visible only when the feature is enabled, so there's an optional block to simulate this behavior:            <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"           content="text html; charset=UTF-8"  >      HOME - Fibonacci             List of links:                 <a             th:href="@{ web fibonacci number=${number} }"             th:text="'Compute ' + ${number} + 'th fibonacci'">                         The second one just shows the value of the computed Fibonacci number and also a link to go back to the home page:            <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"           content="text html; charset=UTF-8"  >      Fibonacci Example          [ 256 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10   back       In order to get both templates to work, they should be in a specific location. They are src main resources templates home.html and src main resources templates fibonacci.html respectively.  Finally, the masterpiece, which is the controller that connects all this and makes it work:  @Controller public class FibonacciWebController {     @Autowired     FibonacciFeatureConfig fibonacciFeatureConfig;      @Autowired     @Qualifier "fibonacci"      private FibonacciService fibonacciProvider;      @RequestMapping value = " ", method = GET      public String home Model model  {         model.addAttribute              "isWebEnabled",             fibonacciFeatureConfig.isWebEnabled            ;         if  fibonacciFeatureConfig.isWebEnabled    {             model.addAttribute                  "arrayOfInts",                 Arrays.asList 5, 7, 8, 16               ;         }         return "home";     }      @RequestMapping value =" web fibonacci", method = GET      public String fibonacci              @RequestParam value = "number"  Integer number,             Model model  {         if  number != null  {             model.addAttribute "number", number ;             model.addAttribute                  "value",                 fibonacciProvider.getNthNumber number  ;         }         return "fibonacci";     } }  [ 257 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  Note that this controller and the previous one seen in the REST API example share some similarities. This is because both are constructed with the same framework and use the same resources. However, there are slight differences between them; one is annotated as @Controller instead of both being @RestController. This is because the web controller is serving template pages with custom information, while the REST API generates a JSON object response.  Let's see this working, again using this Gradle command:      $> gradle clean run  This is the generated home page:  This is shown when visiting the Fibonacci number link:  [ 258 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  But we turn off the feature using the following code:  features:     fibonacci:         restEnabled: true         webEnabled: false  Relaunching the application, we browse to the home page and see that those links are not shown anymore, but we can still access the page if we already know the URL. If we manually write http:  localhost:8080 web fibonacci?number=15, we can still access the page:  This practice is very useful, but it usually adds unnecessary complexity to your code. Don't forget to refactor the code, deleting old toggles that you won't use anymore. It will keep your code clean and readable. Also, a good point is getting this working without restarting the application. There are many storage options that do not require a restart, databases being the most popular.  Summary Feature Toggles are a nice way to hide and or handle partially finished functionalities in production environments. This may sound weird for those deploying code to production on demand, but it is quite common to find this situation when practicing continuous integration, delivery, or deployment.  We have introduced the technique and discussed the pros and cons. We have also enumerated some of the typical cases where toggling features can be helpful. Finally, we have implemented two different use cases: a Feature Toggle with a very simple REST API, and a Feature Toggle in a web application.  [ 259 ]   Feature Toggles – Deploying Partially Done Features to Production  Chapter 10  Although the code presented in this chapter is fully functional, it isn't very common to use a file-based property system for this matter. There are many libraries more suitable for production environments that can help us to implement this technique, providing a lot of capabilities, such as using a web interface to handle features, storing preferences in a database, or allowing access to concrete user profiles.  In the next chapter we are going to put the TDD concepts described in the book all together. We are going to name some good practices and recommendations that are very useful when programming in the TDD way.  [ 260 ]   11  – Albert Einstein  Putting It All Together  "If you always do what you always did, then you will always get what you always got."  We have gone through a lot of theory followed by even more practice. The entire journey was like a speeding train and we have hardly had an opportunity to repeat what we learned. There was no time for rest.  The good news is that the time for the reflection is now. We'll summarize everything we learned and go through TDD best practices. Some of those have already been mentioned, while others will be new.  Topics covered in this chapter include:  TDD in a nutshell Common conventions and good practices, such as in naming tests Tools Next steps   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11  TDD in a nutshell Red-Green-Refactor is the pillar of TDD that wraps it into a short and repeatable cycle. By short, we mean very short. The time dedicated to each phase is often counted in minutes, if not seconds. Write a test, see it fail, write just enough implementation code to make the last test pass, run all tests, and pass into the green phase. Once the minimum code is written so that we have safety in the form of passing tests, it is time to refactor the code until it is as good as we're hoping it to be. While in this phase, tests should always pass. Neither new functionalities nor new tests can be introduced while refactoring is in progress. Doing all this in such a short period of time is often scary, or might sound impossible. We hope that, through the exercises we did together, your skills have improved, as well as your confidence and speed.  While there is the word test in TDD, it is not the main benefit nor objective. TDD is, first and foremost, a concept of a better way to design our code. On top of that, we end up with tests that should be used to continuously check that the application continues working as expected.  The importance of speed was mentioned often previously. While part of this is accomplished by us being ever more proficient in TDD, another contributor is test doubles  mocking, stubbing, spying, and so on . With these, we can remove the need for external dependencies such as databases, file systems, third-party services, and so on.  What are the other benefits of TDD? Documentation is one of them. Since code itself is the only accurate and always up-to-date representation of the applications we're working on, specifications written using TDD  being code as well  is the first place we should turn to when we need to better understand what a piece of code does.  How about design? You noticed how TDD produces code that is designed better. Rather than defining design in advance, with TDD it tends to emerge as we progress from one specification to another. At the same time, code that is easy to test is well-designed code. Tests force us to apply some coding best practices.  We also learned that TDD does not need to be practiced only on small units  methods . It can also be used at a much higher-level, where the focus is on a feature or a behavior that can span multiple methods, classes, or even applications and systems. One of the forms of TDD practiced at such a high-level is behavior-driven development  BDD . Unlike TDD, which is based on the unit tests that are done by developers for developers, BDD can be used by almost everyone in your organization. Since it tackles behaviors and it's written in natural  ubiquitous  language, testers, managers, business representatives, and others can participate in its creation and use it as a reference later on.  [ 262 ]   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11  We defined legacy code as code without tests. We faced some of the challenges legacy code puts in front of us and learned some of the techniques that can be used to make it testable.  With all this in mind, let's go through TDD best practices.  Best practices Coding best practices are a set of informal rules that the software development community has developed over time, which can help to improve the quality of software. While each application needs a level of creativity and originality  after all, we're trying to build something new or better , coding practices help us avoid some of the problems others faced before us. If you're just starting with TDD, it is a good idea to apply some  if not all  of the best practices generated by others.  For easier classification of TDD best practices, we divided them into four categories:  Naming conventions Processes Development practices Tools  As you'll see, not all of them are exclusive to TDD. Since a big part of TDD consists of writing tests, many of the best practices presented in the following sections apply to testing in general, while others are related to general coding best practices. No matter the origin, all of them are useful when practicing TDD.  Take the advice with a certain dose of skepticism. Being a great programmer is not only about knowing how to code, but also about being able to decide which practice, framework, or style best suits the project and the team. Being agile is not about following someone else's rules, but about knowing how to adapt to circumstances and choose the best tools and practices that suit the team and the project.  [ 263 ]   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11  Naming conventions Naming conventions help to organize tests better, so that it is easier for developers to find what they're looking for. Another benefit is that many tools expect that those conventions are followed. There are many naming conventions in use, and those presented here are just a drop in the ocean. The logic is that any naming convention is better than none. Most important is that everyone on the team knows what conventions are being used and are comfortable with them. Choosing more popular conventions has the advantage that newcomers to the team can get up to speed fast, since they can leverage existing knowledge to find their way around.  Separate the implementation from the test code. Benefits: It avoids accidentally packaging tests together with production binaries; many build tools expect tests to be in a certain source directory.  Common practice is to have at least two source directories. Implementation code should be located in src main java and test code in src test java. In bigger projects, the number of source directories can increase, but the separation between implementation and tests should remain as is.  Build tools such as Gradle and Maven expect source directory separation as well as naming conventions.  You might have noticed that the build.gradle files that we used throughout this book did not explicitly specify what to test, nor what classes to use to create a .jar file. Gradle assumes that tests are in src test java and that the implementation code that should be packaged into a JAR file is in src main java.  Place test classes in the same package as implementation. Benefits: Knowing that tests are in the same package as the code helps you to find code faster.  As stated in the previous practice, even though packages are the same, classes are in separate source directories.  All exercises throughout this book followed this convention.  Name test classes in a similar fashion to the classes they test. Benefits: Knowing that tests have a similar name to the classes they are testing helps you find the classes faster.  [ 264 ]   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11  One commonly used practice is to name tests the same as the implementation classes, with the suffix Test. If, for example, the implementation class is TickTackToe, the test class should be TickTackToeTest.  However, in all cases, with the exception of those we used throughout the refactoring exercises, we prefer the suffix Spec. It helps to make a clear distinction that test methods are primarily created as a way to specify what will be developed. Testing is a great sub- product of those specifications.  Use descriptive names for test methods. Benefits: It helps in understanding the objective of tests.  Using method names that describe tests is beneficial when trying to figure out why some tests failed or when the coverage should be increased with more tests. It should be clear what conditions are set before the test, what actions are performed, and what the expected outcome is.  There are many different ways to name test methods, and our preferred method is to name them using the Given When Then syntax used in the BDD scenarios. Given describes  pre conditions, When describes actions, and Then describes the expected outcome. If a test does not have preconditions  usually set using @Before and @BeforeClass annotations , Given can be skipped.  Let's take a look at one of the specifications we created for our Tic-Tac-Toe application:      @Test     public void whenPlayAndWholeHorizontalLineThenWinner   {         ticTacToe.play 1, 1 ;    X         ticTacToe.play 1, 2 ;    O         ticTacToe.play 2, 1 ;    X         ticTacToe.play 2, 2 ;    O         String actual = ticTacToe.play 3, 1 ;    X         assertEquals "X is the winner", actual ;     }  Just by reading the name of the method, we can understand what it is about. When we play and the whole horizontal or vertical and diagonal line is populated, then we have a winner.  Do not rely only on comments to provide information about the test objective. Comments do not appear when tests are executed from your favorite IDE, nor do they appear in reports generated by CI or build tools.  [ 265 ]   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11  Processes TDD processes are the core set of practices. Successful implementation of TDD depends on practices described in this section.  Write a test before writing the implementation code. Benefits: It ensures that testable code is written; it ensures that every line of code gets tests written for it.  By writing or modifying the test first, the developer is focused on requirements before starting to work on the implementation code. This is the main difference compared to writing tests after the implementation is done. The additional benefit is that with the tests written first, we are avoiding the danger that the tests work as quality checking  QC  instead of quality assurance  QA . We're trying to ensure that quality is built in, as opposed to checking later whether we met quality objectives.  Only write new code when the test is failing. Benefits: It confirms that the test does not work without the implementation.  If tests are passing without the need to write or modify the implementation code, then either the functionality is already implemented or the test is defective. If new functionality is indeed missing, then the test always passes and is therefore useless. Tests should fail for the expected reason. Even though there are no guarantees that the test is verifying the right thing, with fail first and for the expected reason, confidence that verification is correct should be high.  Rerun all tests every time the implementation code changes. Benefits: It ensures that there are no unexpected side effects caused by code changes.  [ 266 ]   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11  Every time any part of the implementation code changes, all tests should be run. Ideally, tests are fast to execute and can be run by the developer locally. Once code is submitted to  version control, all tests should be run again to ensure that there was no problem due to code merges. This is especially important when more than one developer is working on the code. Continuous integration  CI  tools should be used to pull the code from the repository, compile it, and run tests, such as:  Jenkins  https: ​ ​jenkins.​io ​  Hudson  http:  hudson-ci.org   Travis  https:  travis-ci.org   Bamboo  https:  www.atlassian.com software bamboo   All tests should pass before a new test is written. Benefits: The focus is maintained on a small unit of work; implementation code is  almost  always in working condition.  It is sometimes tempting to write multiple tests before the actual implementation. In other cases, developers ignore problems detected by existing tests and move towards new features. This should be avoided whenever possible. In most cases, breaking this rule will only introduce technical debt that will need to be paid with interest. One of the goals of TDD is that the implementation code is  almost  always working as expected. Some projects, due to pressures to reach the delivery date or maintain the budget, break this rule and dedicate time to new features, leaving the task of fixing the code associated with failed tests for later. These projects usually end up postponing the inevitable.  Refactor only after all tests are passing. Benefits: This type of refactoring is safe.  If all implementation code that can be affected has tests and they are all passing, it is relatively safe to refactor. In most cases, there is no need for new tests. Small modifications to existing tests should be enough. The expected outcome of refactoring is to have all tests passing both before and after the code is modified.  [ 267 ]   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11  Development practices Practices listed in this section are focused on the best way to write tests. Write the simplest code to pass the test as it ensures cleaner and clearer design and avoids unnecessary features.  The idea is that the simpler the implementation, the better and easier it is to maintain the product. The idea adheres to the keep it simple, stupid  KISS  principle. This states that  most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. Write assertions first, act later as it clarifies the purpose of the requirements and tests early.  Once the assertion is written, the purpose of the test is clear and the developer can concentrate on the code that will accomplish that assertion and, later on, on the actual implementation. Minimize assertions in each test as it avoids assertion roulette; it allows the execution of more asserts.  If multiple assertions are used within one test method, it might be hard to tell which of them caused a test failure. This is especially common when tests are executed as part of the CI process. If the problem cannot be reproduced on a developer's machine  as may be the case if the problem is caused by environmental issues , fixing the problem may be difficult and time consuming.  When one assert fails, execution of that test method stops. If there are other asserts in that method, they will not be run and information that can be used in debugging is lost.  Last but not least, having multiple asserts creates confusion about the objective of the test.  This practice does not mean that there should always be only one assert per test method. If there are other asserts that test the same logical condition or unit of functionality, they can be used within the same method.  [ 268 ]   Putting It All Together  Let's go through a few examples:  @Test  Chapter 11  public final void whenOneNumberIsUsedThenReturnValueIsThatSameNumber   {     Assert.assertEquals 3, StringCalculator.add "3"  ; }  @Test public final void whenTwoNumbersAreUsedThenReturnValueIsTheirSum   {     Assert.assertEquals 3+6, StringCalculator.add "3,6"  ; }  The preceding code contains two specifications that clearly define what the objective of the tests is. By reading the method names and looking at the assert, there should be clarity on what is being tested. Consider the following example:  @Test public final void whenNegativeNumbersAreUsedThenRuntimeExceptionIsThrown   {     RuntimeException exception = null;     try {         StringCalculator.add "3,-6,15,-18,46,33" ;     } catch  RuntimeException e  {         exception = e;     }     Assert.assertNotNull "Exception was not thrown", exception ;     Assert.assertEquals "Negatives not allowed: [-6, -18]",             exception.getMessage   ; }  This specification has more than one assert, but they are testing the same logical unit of functionality. The first assert is confirming that the exception exists, and the second that its message is correct. When multiple asserts are used in one test method, they should all contain messages that explain the failure. This way, debugging the failed assert is easier. In the case of one assert per test method, messages are welcome but not necessary, since it should be clear from the method name what the objective of the test is:  @Test public final void whenAddIsUsedThenItWorks   {     Assert.assertEquals 0, StringCalculator.add ""  ;     Assert.assertEquals 3, StringCalculator.add "3"  ;     Assert.assertEquals 3+6, StringCalculator.add "3,6"  ;     Assert.assertEquals 3+6+15+18+46+33,  [ 269 ]   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11              StringCalculator.add "3,6,15,18,46,33"  ;     Assert.assertEquals 3+6+15, StringCalculator.add "3,6n15"  ;     Assert.assertEquals 3+6+15,             StringCalculator.add "  ;n3;6;15"  ; Assert.assertEquals 3+1000+6,             StringCalculator.add "3,1000,1001,6,1234"  ; }  This test has many asserts. It is unclear what the functionality is, and if one of them fails, it is not known whether the rest would work or not. It might be hard to understand the failure when this test is executed through some CI tools.  Do not introduce dependencies between tests. Benefits: The tests work in any order independently, whether all or only a subset is run.  Each test should be independent of the others. Developers should be able to execute any individual test, a set of tests, or all of them. Often, due to the test runner's design, there is no guarantee that tests will be executed in any particular order. If there are dependencies between tests, they might easily be broken with the introduction of new ones.  Tests should run fast. Benefits: These tests are used often.  If it takes a lot of time to run tests, developers will stop using them or run only a small subset related to the changes they are making. The benefit of fast tests, besides fostering their usage, is quick feedback. The sooner the problem is detected, the easier it is to fix it. Knowledge about the code that produced the problem is still fresh. If the developer already started working on the next feature while waiting for the completion of the execution of the tests, they might decide to postpone fixing the problem until that new feature is developed. On the other hand, if they drops their current work to fix the bug, time is lost in context switching.  Tests should be so quick that developers can run all of them after each change without getting bored or frustrated.  Use test doubles. Benefits: This reduces code dependency and test execution will be faster.  [ 270 ]   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11  Mocks are prerequisites for the fast execution of tests and the ability to concentrate on a single unit of functionality. By mocking dependencies external to the method that is being tested, the developer is able to focus on the task at hand without spending time in setting them up. In the case of bigger teams, those dependencies might not even be developed. Also, the execution of tests without mocks tends to be slow. Good candidates for mocks are databases, other products, services, and so on.  Use setup and teardown methods. Benefits: This allows setup and teardown code to be executed before and after the class or each method.  In many cases, some code needs to be executed before the test class or before each method in a class. For this purpose, JUnit has @BeforeClass and @Before annotations that should be used as the setup phase. @BeforeClass executes the associated method before the class is loaded  before the first test method is run . @Before executes the associated method before each test is run. Both should be used when there are certain preconditions required by tests. The most common example is setting up test data in the  hopefully in-memory  database.  At the opposite end are @After and @AfterClass annotations, which should be used as the teardown phase. Their main purpose is to destroy data or a state created during the setup phase or by the tests themselves. As stated in one of the previous practices, each test should be independent from the others. Moreover, no test should be affected by the others. The teardown phase helps to maintain the system as if no test was previously executed.  Do not use base classes in tests. Benefits: It provides test clarity.  Developers often approach test code in the same way as implementation. One of the common mistakes is to create base classes that are extended by tests. This practice avoids code duplication at the expense of test clarity. When possible, base classes used for testing should be avoided or limited. Having to navigate from the test class to its parent, to the parent of the parent, and so on in order to understand the logic behind tests often introduces unnecessary confusion. Clarity in tests should be more important than avoiding code duplication.  [ 271 ]   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11  Tools TDD, coding, and testing in general, are heavily dependent on other tools and processes. Some of the most important ones are as follows. Each of them is too big a topic to be explored in this book, so they will be described only briefly.  Code coverage and CI. Benefits: It gives assurance that everything is tested.  Code coverage practices and tools are very valuable in determining that all code, branches, and complexity is tested. Some of these tools are as follows:  CI tools are a must for all except the most trivial projects. Some of the most used tools are:  JaCoCo  http:  www.eclemma.org jacoco   Clover  https:  www.atlassian.com software clover  Cobertura  http:  cobertura.github.io cobertura    Jenkins  https: ​ ​jenkins.​io ​  Hudson  http:  hudson-ci.org   Travis  https:  travis-ci.org    Bamboo  https:  www.atlassian.com software bamboo .  Use TDD together with BDD. Benefits: Both developer unit tests and functional customer facing tests are covered.  While TDD with unit tests is a great practice, in many cases it does not provide all the testing that projects need. TDD is fast to develop, helps the design process, and gives confidence through fast feedback. On the other hand, BDD is more suitable for integration and functional testing, provides a better process for requirement gathering through narratives, and is a better way of communicating with clients through scenarios. Both should be used, and together they provide a full process that involves all stakeholders and team members. TDD  based on unit tests  and BDD should be driving the development process. Our recommendation is to use TDD for high code coverage and fast feedback, and BDD as automated acceptance tests. While TDD is mostly oriented towards white-box, BDD often aims at black-box testing. Both TDD and BDD are trying to focus on QA instead of QC.  [ 272 ]   Putting It All Together  Chapter 11  Summary In this chapter, we first went through a brief overview of TDD. We learned about the four best practices that can help to improve the quality of software.    Moving on to the final chapter, we will be introduced to the concepts of CI and continuous delivery, and the importance of TDD all through the pipeline process will be highlighted with an example.  [ 273 ]   12  Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  "Nothing speaks like results. If you want to build the kind of credibility that connects with people, then deliver results before you deliver a message. Get out and do what you advise others to do. Communicate from experience."  – John C. Maxwell  Throughout this book, concepts and good practices have been presented with isolated examples. The goal of this chapter is to put into practice some of these concepts by applying them to a more realistic scenario.  To accomplish that, we are introducing a fictitious company called Awesome Gambling Corp. This company is struggling with a few problems in its software development life cycle that could be easily solved by applying some of the things we have learned in this book. As a disclaimer, any similarity with a real company is pure coincidence. Furthermore, for the sake of brevity, the codebase is not very extensive and some of the problems have been exaggerated in order to better represent the issue that needs to be addressed.  The topics covered not necessarily in order, are:  Continuous integration Continuous delivery Benefits of test-driven development Identifying quick wins   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  Case study – Awesome Gambling Corp  You are Alice, a software developer, and you just joined the software development team of Awesome Gambling Corp. Your teammates are trying to bring you up to speed in the shortest time possible. It's your first day and your teammate, John, who has been designated as your mentor, is going to be guiding you during the first few hours in the company.  After a pleasant cup of coffee, he rapidly sets the topic of your conversation to all the tasks and procedures that will comprise your day-to-day work. Your team is developing and maintaining a very simple thimblerig-service. As soon as you hear the word thimblerig, you ashamedly admit this is the first time you have heard that word. John laughs and says he didn't know it either when he joined the company two years ago.   The Thimblerig game, also known as three shells and a pea, is an ancient gambling game. The rules are pretty simple, there are three shells, and the pea is covered by one of the three. The three shells are shuffled at really high speed and, when finished, the player has to guess which shell hides the pea.  After the explanation, he kindly offers to help you downloading the code project from the repository and briefly explains to you the overall concepts.  Once he is done with the explanation, he asks you to read the code on your own. He also tells you he is the person for you to go to in case you have any questions or concerns. You express your gratitude for his time and start browsing the project.  Exploring the codebase As you start browsing the project, you realise that the application is not very complex. In fact, the project contains roughly a dozen Java classes and, as you start opening and looking at the files, you notice that none of them is longer than one hundred lines. That is pretty good, the codebase is small so you will be able to develop new features in no time.  Provided that this is a Gradle project, you quickly open the build.gradle file to acknowledge the frameworks and libraries being used within the project:  apply plugin: 'java' apply plugin: 'org.springframework.boot'  sourceCompatibility = 1.8 targetCompatibility = 1.8  [ 275 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  bootRepackage.executable = true  repositories {   mavenLocal     mavenCentral   }  dependencies {   compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator'   compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'   testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'   testCompile 'org.hamcrest:hamcrest-all:1.3'   testCompile 'org.mockito:mockito-core:1.10.19' }  The Gradle build field looks good. The project you are going to work on is a Spring-based web service. It uses spring-boot-starter-web, so it's very likely you will be able to run it locally without hassle. Moreover, there are some test dependencies which means there should be some tests in the test folder as well.  A couple of minutes later you already have a mental map of the application. There is a class called ThimblerigService which handles the logic of the game. It has a dependency on a RandomNumberGenerator and it only has one public method, which is placeBet. Methods and classes have an understandable name, so it isn't hard to figure out what they do:  @Service public class ThimblerigService {   private RandomNumberGenerator randomNumberGenerator;    @Autowired   ThimblerigService RandomNumberGenerator randomNumberGenerator  {     this.randomNumberGenerator = randomNumberGenerator;   }    public BetResult placeBet int position, BigDecimal betAmount  {     ...   } }  [ 276 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  Besides that class, there is only one controller class that implements an API: it is ThimblerigAPI. It exposes only one method, which is placeBet. Other company services invoke that POST method in order to play one game in this service. The service resolves the bet and includes in the response details such as whether there's a prize won, the amount, and so forth:  @RestController @RequestMapping " v1 thimblerig"  public class ThimblerigAPI {   private ThimblerigService thimblerigService;    @Autowired   public ThimblerigAPI ThimblerigService thimblerigService  {     this.thimblerigService = thimblerigService;   }    @ResponseBody   @PostMapping value = " placeBet",       consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE    public BetReport placeBet @RequestBody NewBet bet  {     BetResult betResult =         thimblerigService.placeBet bet.getPick  , bet.getAmount   ;     return new BetReport betResult ;   } }  This is a fairly easy setup and everything is crystal-clear, so you decide to move on and start looking at the tests.  As you open the test folder and start looking for tests, you are very surprised when you discover there is only one test class: ThimblerigServiceTest. One single good test is worth more than hundred bad ones but still, you think this application is poorly unit-tested:  public class ThimblerigServiceTest {   @Test   public void placingBetDoesNotAcceptPositionsLessThanOne   {     ...   }    @Test   public void placingBetDoesNotAcceptPositionsGreaterThan3   {     ...   }    @Test   public void placingBetOnlyAcceptsAmountsGreaterThanZero   {  [ 277 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12      ...   }    @Test   public void onFailedBetThePrizeIsZero   {     ...   }    @Test   public void whenThePositionIsGuessedCorrectlyThePrizeIsDoubleTheBet   {     ...   } }  After opening the class and going over all the tests it contains, your impression changes slightly for the good. The tests cover the core service completely and they seem meaningful and exhaustive. But despite that, you can't avoid turning your head to John and asking him why there's only one test. He tells you they didn't have much time to create tests because they were in a hurry, so only the critical parts have tests. Whether a piece of code is critical or not is very subjective, but you understand the situation; in fact, you have been in that situations many times.  Only one second later, before you have time to go back to your task, John adds another interesting point to his answer: the quality assurance  QA  department. The aim of this department is to test all release candidates before they reach a production environment. Their mission is to find errors and bugs that might affect the application and report them. In some cases, if any of the errors found are very critical, the release is stopped and it will never be deployed to production. This procedure usually takes from three to five days. You think that could be a bottleneck in some scenarios, so you ask him to give you further details of the release process.  Release procedure Provided that the project is a simple REpresentational State Transfer  REST  service, the creation of a release is not complex at all. According to the current procedure, a developer compiles the code and sends the artifact to the team that manages all deployments. That team coordinates the testing and deployment to production with the customer and QA departments.  [ 278 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  You decide to ask John if he is happy with the process. Before you even get the answer, you know John is not happy at all with it. You can see on his face that he is making an effort to hide his feelings about it. John gulps back his emotions and starts describing the current situation of the team.  It turns out that not everything is joy and candy in the development team. All developers,  when they start coding, create their own branch from the master branch in the repository. This is not bad at all, but it has happened that some branches have been merged back to the master many weeks later. The issue is that the master branch has changed a lot since then and the code base diverges a lot, meaning the merge is very difficult, unpleasant, and error prone.  Besides the occasional merging problems, it has happened that one developer compiled his local branch by mistake and it was deployed to production, generating chaos, carnage, and uncertainty for a short period.  On top of that, the customer is not very happy with the time new features take to be implemented. They are complaining about this from time to time, saying that every single tiny change takes at least a week to be applied.  You are puzzled how this can happen to a very tiny REST service, but of course John was referring to other bigger projects in the company. You know this kind of problem can be solved, or at least mitigated, by implementing continuous integration  CI  and continuous delivery. In fact, automating processes as much as possible enables you to focus on other problems by getting rid of those that are trivial.  After this small reflection, you now know you need more information about the deployment procedure and you also know that John is willing to give you the details.   Deployments to production With the release process covered, John starts explaining to you how the service is deployed to production. It is very manual work: one member of the infrastructure team  IT  department copies the artifact to the server and executes a few commands to get it running.  John also takes the opportunity to add some stories of errors that they suffered in the past, like the time when, instead of deploying the latest version, the infrastructure operator mistakenly redeployed an old version. A bunch of old bugs reappeared and stayed in production until somebody found out what had happened.  [ 279 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  While listening to those stories, you can't help but start thinking about what you have learned from previous projects and companies. You know that putting code into a production environment could be a very easy and straightforward task, a never-ending nightmare, or something in the middle. It depends on many factors and sometimes it is not up to us to change it. In some scenarios, deploying an application to production needs to be acknowledged by people who have the power to decide when and what is deployed. In others, there is strict regulation that turns what should be an easy procedure into a tedious and verbose task.  Furthermore, automating deployments is a way to reduce the risk factor that human interaction can add. Creating a repeatable process can be as easy as writing all the necessary steps in a script and scheduling its execution. It is well known that any single script can't replace a human completely, but, needless to say, the goal is not to replace humans with scripts. The main purpose of this is to provide a tool that can be executed autonomously and humans can supervise it, with manual intervention just in case it is necessary. For this, implementing continuous delivery is very suitable.  After John's brief but intense introduction, you feel that you are ready to start working on your own. You have many possible improvements in your head and you are definitely eager to implement them.  Conclusions Even though the situation in this company has been exaggerated for didactic purposes, there are still companies struggling with these problems. Indeed, Alice knew that the way software developers at Awesome Gambling Corp work is not ideal. There are many techniques, some of them covered in this book, that could help the company stop focusing on unconscious mistakes and start focusing on other things that can add more value to their final product.  In the next section, we are going to address some of the problems described by proposing one possible solution. This is not a unique solution; actually, the solution proposed includes some tools, and there are many options for each of the tools used. Moreover, every company has its own culture and restrictions, and because of that, the proposed solution might not be fully suitable.  [ 280 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  Possible improvements In this section and the following subsections, we are going to tackle some of the problems described in Alice's story. Because the code we inherited from the example is already implemented, we can't apply TDD here. Instead, we are going to set the basis and prepare the ground for future developments where applying TDD will become very useful.  Although there are always many things that can be improved, the pain points being addressed are code merging issues, lots of manual testing, manual releases, and the length of time taken to develop changes or new features.  For the first two, we are going to increase the test coverage of the application and implement CI. A Jenkins server is going to be configured to address the third issue, manual releases. And finally, the last issue, which is the long time to market  TTM , is going to be mitigated by implementing the rest of the solutions.  Increasing test coverage Among the metrics for measuring code quality, there is one that is especially difficult to understand, and that is test coverage. Test coverage is a dangerous metric because a really high coverage does not imply the code is well tested. As the name says, it only contemplates whether a piece of code has been triggered and hence executed by a test. For that reason, the goal of testing is basically a combination of good tests and good coverage. To summarize, it is the quality of tests that matters, the code coverage is secondary.  There are some scenarios though where code coverage is indeed a good indicator. These are when the code coverage is really low. In those, the number means a greater part of the codebase is not being tested and therefore tests are not ensuring we are not introducing errors.  Additionally, creating good automated tests can reduce the amount of time spent by the QA team on performing regression tests. This very likely reduces the time they spend testing the same code over and over again, increasing the team's delivery velocity.  [ 281 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  Implementing continuous integration In large companies with multiple teams working in parallel, it is very common to end up having tons of integration conflicts. This occurs more frequently when the codebase is under heavy development.  In order to mitigate this, it is highly recommended to use CI. The main idea is that development branches should not diverge much from the master branch. One way to do it is splitting the changes or new features into really small chunks so they can be finished and merged back pretty fast. Another way is to merge regularly; this is more suitable when features are difficult to break down into small ones.  When facing indivisible features, such as architectural changes, Feature Toggles are very helpful. With Feature Toggles, unfinished features can be merged and will not be accessible until the flag is turned on.  Towards continuous delivery One of the problems developers were facing in the story is the manual creation of releases. There are many tools that help automate such tasks, such as Jenkins, Travis, or Bamboo, just to name a few. As part of the proposed solution, we are going to configure an instance of Jenkins to run all of these tasks automatically. On every execution of the Jenkins job, a new release of the thimblerig-service will be created.  Moreover, since we already moved to CI, the status of the master branch should be always ready for production. And, in case some unfinished features have been merged, they are hidden thanks to Feature Toggles.  At this point, to solve the problem of the releases, we could have implemented either continuous delivery or continuous deployment  CD , but for the sake of simplicity we are going to implement continuous delivery. Let's get into it.  [ 282 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  Jenkins installation Jenkins is a very powerful tool and easy to learn. In this section, we are going to prepare the environment, which consists of a virtual machine running a Docker image of Jenkins. This setup is for demonstration purposes; for real scenarios, it will be better to install it in a dedicated server with more resources, or get it as a service from a company like CloudBees. In this particular case, all the configuration is located in the Vagrantfile:    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 9090  Vagrant.configure "2"  do config    config.vm.box = "ubuntu trusty64"   config.vm.box_check_update = false    config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do vb     vb.gui = false     vb.memory = 2048   end    config.vm.provision "docker" do d     d.run "jenkins jenkins",       args: "-p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins_home: var jenkins_home"   end end  So, to get it up and running, we just need to execute the following command:  $> vagrant up  If, after a restart or whatever the reason might be, Jenkins appears offline or you can't reach it, try running the same command with provision flag: $> vagrant up --provision  [ 283 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  Once finished, we can open http:  localhost:9090 in our favorite browser to continue the setup:  Since we are not installing it in the server but running it in a Docker image, this password is a bit tricky to get. Probably the easiest way is to access the Docker machine and get the password from the file, and that could be done like this:  $> vagrant ssh $> docker exec jenkins-jenkins cat  var jenkins_home secrets initialAdminPassword  [ 284 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  Copy the password, paste in the password field, and we move to the next step, which is configuring plugins. For now, we are going to install the recommended ones only. Other plugins can be installed later on in the administration panel:  [ 285 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  Then, when the setup has finished installing plugins, another screen is shown. This is the last step of the configuration, creating an admin user. It's recommended to create a user with a password that is easy to remember:  This step can be skipped, but then the admin password will remain the same as the initial password, which is really difficult to remember. Now we are ready to use our brand new Jenkins installation.  Automating builds Once we have Jenkins up and running, it is time to start using it. We are going to create a task on Jenkins that will download the thimblerig-service master branch, execute the tests, build it, and archive the resultant artifact.  [ 286 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  Let's start by creating a Freestyle project:  We have to tell Jenkins where the repository is located. In this example, we don't need authentication, but is very likely we would need it in a real-world scenario:  [ 287 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  The thimblerig-service project is a Gradle project. We are going to use the Jenkins Gradle plugin for compiling, testing, and building our service:  Finally, we have to specify the location of the test reports and the artifact built:  [ 288 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  And we are done. This is not very different when compared to what we usually do in our local environment. It downloads the code from the master branch and uses Gradle for building the service, as developers were doing, according to John in the story.  First execution With our project created in Jenkins, now it is time to test it. We never configured a triggered execution, so Jenkins is not monitoring the changes in the repository. For this example, launching the builds manually is more than enough, but in a real scenario we would like it to be triggered automatically on every change in the master branch:  The build has finished successfully; we can see in the summary that tests were executed but none has failed. We are ready to download the artifact and try to execute it locally:  $> chmod u+x thimblerig-service.jar $> . thimblerig-service.jar  [ 289 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  At some point, the logs will display a message like Tomcat started on port s : 8080  http . This means our that service is ready and we can start using it. To make sure, we can always check the health of the service by running:  $> curl http:  localhost:8080 health {"status":"UP"}  This concludes the example of continuous delivery. Although this example is fully functional, Jenkins is not the best place to store releases of the service. For a real-world use case, there are much more powerful alternatives, such as Artifactory, or simply Dockerize the service and push new versions to a private Docker registry.  What is next? The example here is purely academic, and parts of the solution are a bit hacky. In a real company, Jenkins would be installed in a dedicated server and would have many more tasks to build and release. To orchestrate all of this, proper management of generated artifacts is needed. As mentioned earlier, some of the solutions that companies are adopting are tools such as Artifactory or private instances of Docker Registry to store Docker images of the services. Whatever the storage of choice, the procedure will remain the same—compile, test, build, archive. It's just a matter of configuration.  For the sake of brevity, some parts that required new code have been omitted and are left for the reader to complete as an exercise. Here are some ideas of how to continue:  Create some tests for the REST controller. There is an issue in the random number generator—it is not random at all. Fork the thimblerig-service project, create a test to reproduce the issue, fix it, and release a new version of the service by using the recently-created build project on Jenkins. Use Docker.  All the code snippets and the rest of the project files required can be found online in the following repository: https: ​ ​bitbucket.​org ​alexgarcia ​tdd-​java-​thimblerig-​service  [ 290 ]   Leverage TDD by Implementing Continuous Delivery  Chapter 12  This is just the beginning You might have expected that by the time you reached the end of this book, you'd know everything about test-driven development  TDD . If that was the case, we're sorry that we'll have to disappoint you. It takes a lot of time and practice to master any craft, and TDD is no exception. Go on, apply what you have learned to your projects. Share knowledge with your colleagues. Most importantly, practice, practice, and practice. As with karate, only through continuous practice and repetition can one fully master TDD. We have been using it for a long time, and we still often face new challenges and learn new ways to improve our craftsmanship.  This does not have to be the end Writing this book was a long journey filled with many adventures. We hope you enjoyed reading it as much as we enjoyed writing it.  We share our experience on a wide variety of subjects at our blog, at http: ​  technologyconversations.​com.  Summary Throughout Alice's fictitious story, some of the common problems which companies are facing nowadays were presented. One of them is the lack of time. In this particular case, and in the majority of cases, people lack time because they are trapped doing repetitive tasks that don't add value, thus there is this constant feeling that it's impossible to achieve more ambitious goals. One of the main excuses that developers give when asked why they are not practicing TDD is the lack of time for writing tests.  This chapter tackles a possible solution for this, which is using Jenkins. A virtual machine with an instance of Jenkins was configured to automate some of the repetitive tasks that were draining time from the team.  Once the problems have been addressed, TDD becomes really handy. Every new feature developed in the TDD way will be more than covered by tests, then future changes on that feature will be run against the test suite, and this will fail if one of the tests is not satisfied.

Test-driven development (TDD) is a development approach that relies on a test-first procedure that emphasizes writing a test before writing the necessary code, and then refactoring the code to optimize it.The value of performing TDD with Java, one of the longest established programming languages, is to improve the productivity of programmers and the maintainability and performance of code, and develop a deeper understanding of the language and how to employ it effectively.Starting with the basics of TDD and understanding why its adoption is beneficial, this book will take you from the first steps of TDD with Java until you are confident enough to embrace the practice in your day-to-day routine.You'll be guided through setting up tools, frameworks, and the environment you need, and we will dive right into hands-on exercises with the goal of mastering one practice, tool, or framework at a time. You'll learn about the Red-Green-Refactor procedure, how to write unit tests, and how to use them as executable documentation.With this book, you'll also discover how to design simple and easily maintainable code, work with mocks, utilize behavior-driven development, refactor old legacy code, and release a half-finished feature to production with feature toggles.You will finish this book with a deep understanding of the test-driven development methodology and the confidence to apply it to application programming with Java.
