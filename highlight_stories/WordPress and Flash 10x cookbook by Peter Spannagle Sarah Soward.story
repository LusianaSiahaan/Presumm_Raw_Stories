If you want to set up multiple WordPress installations    or use other database-driven software , you will probably want a host that offers multiple  MySQL databases.  We suggest a Linux-based  Apache  server. Make sure you get enough  storage—at least 1GB. Additional utilities that are helpful for WordPress-based  sites include PHPMyAdmin  for working with your database  and SimpleScripts   for installing and updating WordPress .  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Developing a strategy with Flash and WordPress  f Embedding a .swf:  via Kimili plugin  f Adding Flash detection with SWFObject 2.0 and embedding the .swf  f Adding Flash detection with Flash-generated JavaScript and embedding the .swf   Leveraging Flash in WordPress Developing a strategy to use Flash &  WordPress Identify your user level and a specific application. Develop an SEO strategy. Determine what  files need to be configured and modified to achieve your goals.  Getting ready There are an unlimited number of ways to use WordPress and Flash together. The needs,  ideas, and abilities of no two users will be the same. The limits are determined by you—by   your skill level and the goals you set.  The first step is to identify your level of familiarity with the Web and Multimedia design  software. Be honest in your self-assessment—and don't be discouraged, no matter where you  are starting today. Understanding your user level allows you to set reasonable expectations.  Take a look at the following figures to understand your user level. With practice and  experience, by accessing the many free resources available online and through training tools   such as this manual , you will increase your level of proficiency.  You may be a new blogger, or may have been blogging for years. You may be an admin user  supporting a team using WP for business or organizational needs, a theme designer, or a   plugin developer. This book is written with you in mind, assuming that you are familiar with   WP basics, or are willing to become so.  new blogger  Publish content  experienced blogger  Extend WP with plugins  Little to no ex- perience with administering a website  Can effectively use a CMS to manage online content  admin user  theme modification  edit code in a text editor, use a FTP client, batch resize  rename and unzip com- pressed files  i  e t a d e m r e t n  i  c s a B  8  theme design  coding CSS and XHTML  write a cus- stom theme  plugin design  coding CSS, XHTML and PHP  write a WP plugin  d e c n a v d A   new user  animated banner add  Little experi- ence with the  Flash inter- face.

Flash takes care of your dynamic media needs, and WordPress makes it easy to administrate  your site. The way to use them together is with SEO in mind.  In terms of density of information presented to a search engine, Flash is not as effective as  XHTML, in spite of recent advances. A Flash animation can have a description tag, however,  properly marked up XHTML that uses   and   to emphasize keywords and phrases, as  well as including links to and from authoritative sources, will still have more SEO value when  compared to a .swf.  Many industries and audiences expect or require Flash animations. Your marketing and   SEO strategy should determine how you mix WordPress and Flash. The goal is content that  people can read and enjoy that is also understood by engines and robots. For those of us   who administer or develop websites, ease of use is also a consideration.  9   Leveraging Flash in WordPress How it works... In your design, when blocking in space for animations, consider how they are both dynamic  and static. An animation does what it does, however lovely it is, and nothing more. Once a user  has seen the animation, there is often no reason to pay attention to it again. WordPress offers  dynamic content—areas of the page that highlight and excerpt the most recent content from  different areas. This encourages users to revisit and explore your site for new content and to pay  special attention to dynamic content areas. While an animation measures change in frames per  second, WordPress allows your users to measure the changes made since their last visit. In this  sense, Web 2.0 represents a true change in technology—transforming the screen itself into an  animation that you program—simply by publishing new content.  So, some Flash is almost always fine. But too much Flash is less useful to search engines,  relative to XHTML. Additionally, Flash animations generally take more time to update than  regular WordPress content.  There's more... There are other ideas about how to combine Flash and WordPress, which we will touch   on in later and more advanced chapters. Our approach should be applicable to the   majority of users.  Where to place the .swf? Flash media can be included anywhere in a WordPress theme: in the header, in a post or a  page, in a sidebar, or in the footer. It takes some time to become familiar with your theme  files—determining which PHP templates are called when different parts of the screen are  clicked. An overview of how WordPress works is useful.  A theme has at least three views, which represent the steps to a given piece of information,  moving from home page to a category to a post.  A WordPress  home page is traditionally a dynamic display of updates from interior sections   like a dashboard . It can also be a static page. It's often named index.php or home.php.  The category archive view is a dynamic display of the posts in a category. It sounds  complicated, but it is logical. When a user clicks on a category, not one piece of information   is returned, but many. This template is called category.php.  The archive view is so named because, though this piece of information may be featured in  other parts of the site, the user has now arrived at the URL for an individual post. The URL can  be used in links or bookmarks to refer back to this specific piece of information. Typically, the  format is a long-reading pane.  page.php, sidebar.php, header.php, and footer.php work just like you'd think.  10   Chapter 1  Edit and debug with Firebug Knowing which PHP templates create pages on your blog is the first step to inserting a  Flash animation directly into theme files. The next step is to determine specifically which    will contain the animation. Firebug helps us match up the correct   tag with  the correct PHP template.  Get Firebug here: http:  getfirebug.com   Firebug is an add-on for Mozilla Firefox. This handy tool allows you to see the CSS and XHTML  that make up any page by context-clicking  right-click in Windows or Ctrl-click for Mac  and  choosing "Inspect Element." The window splits at the bottom. Bring your mouse down to the  bottom-left pane. Hovering over a   tag causes the screen to be highlighted: blue for    width and height, purple for margins, and yellow for padding. Clicking on the blue    tag loads the bottom-right pane with entries from the CSS stylesheet that control its  appearance. It is helpful to have such a visual representation to understand the structure   of a site.  Viewing the source  PC: Ctrl-U Mac: Cmd-Opt-U  of a WordPress blog can be  a confusing experience. Keep in mind that the XHTML output is different than  the component PHP. Your templates are not what you see when you "View  Source"—rather, you are seeing the result of dynamic PHP calls as XHTML,  styled according to CSS. This is what makes WordPress dynamic—there are  no webpages. There are only PHP templates waiting to output your website,  recreated each time as the most recent content.  11   Leveraging Flash in WordPress Additional utilities There are additional utilities we will be using throughout this book; a FTP client and a text  editor are required for intermediate to advanced applications. Dreamweaver is an excellent  tool for coding, if you have it. A fast running stand-alone text editor specific to coding has its  own merits. Here are open-source utilities for Mac and for PC:  FTP Client: FileZilla, http:  filezilla-project.org download.php  Text Editor: Windows comes with Notepad and Mac has TextEdit, but these text editors are not  set up to code for the Web. A text editor for coding gives you access to many additional tools  and options, such as line numbers, keyboard shortcuts, and auto-formatting.   f PC: NotePad ++, http:  notepad-plus.sourceforge.net uk site.htm  f Mac: jEdit, http:  jedit.org  See also   f WordPress Theme Hierarchy, Chapter 7  Embedding Flash .swf files in WordPress The most basic and fundamental way of using WordPress and Flash together is to insert an  animation. The steps are:  1.  Create an animation in Flash. 2.  Export the animation as a .swf. 3.  Upload the .swf to your server. 4.  Embed the .swf in your site.  WordPress makes it easy to embed a .swf—here, we provide an in-depth review of the Kimli  Flash Embed Plugin,  version 2.0.2  based on Swfobject 2.x.  If you do not have an animation to begin with, this section uses a sample Flash animation,  found in the Chapter 1 folder.  12   Chapter 1  Getting ready WordPress displays Flash the same as any other web page—through Flash Detection. Flash  developers use swfObject 2.x and JavaScript for Flash Detection. Otherwise, non-specialists  can use one of a variety of plugins to embed Flash media  SWF or FLV . Kimli Flash Embed is  among the best of such plugins.  The easiest way to embed Flash in WordPress is through the plugin "Kimili Flash Embed  for Wordpress."  http:  kimili.com plug-ins kml_flashembed wp  "Built upon the SWFObject javascript code, it is standards compliant, search engine  friendly, highly flexible and full featured, as well as easy to use."  Quoted from  http:  kimili.com plug-ins kml_flashembed usage  2009 .  How to do it... Installing Kimili Flash Embed  KFE  on your WordPress site is simple.  1.   2.   In your dashboard sidebar, use the downward pointing arrow to expand Plugins and  then click on Add New. In the Search bar, type: flash, as seen in the following screenshot.     13   Leveraging Flash in WordPress  3.  Browse down to Kimli Flash Embed, click Install, and then Activate.  4.  Now that the plugin has been uploaded and activated, the final step is to insert a   Flash file in the .swf format.  5.  Click on Posts  Edit and then the relevant post title  we will be using the default   Hello world! post .  6.  Click on HTML to enter the HTML view.  To add a Flash animation, use the following shortcode, replacing path, y and x  parameters with the respective path, height, and width of your swf: [kml_flashembed movie=" path to your movie.swf"  height="y" width="x"  ]  7.  The movie parameter is the only one required—height and width are optional. Though   it is most efficient to size your .swf during export, the height and width parameters  will resize a .swf file. If you do so, be sure to keep the numbers in scale proportion  to avoid distortion  For reference, look at the following screenshot.  14   Chapter 1  8.   If you're using the Visual Editor to write your posts, look for the red Flash button on  the right. Click to launch the KFE Tag Generator, a wizard-like interface that will assist  you in creating the necessary KFE tag. Again, the only necessary parameter is the  URL to the .swf file you want to display.  That's it! You have now inserted your first Flash animation inside WordPress. It's easy  to do through the shortcode or the KFE Tag Generator. Open another tab  PC: Ctrl + T  Mac:  Cmd + T  to confirm:  How it works... Three main sections comprise the KFE Tag Generator: SWFObject Configuration, SWF  Definition, and Alternative Content.  Configuration options are covered in more detail in the following section, Adding Flash  Detection with SWFObject 2.x. Please see the How to do it... section.  15   Leveraging Flash in WordPress Adding Flash detection with SWFObject 2.x Detect which version of the Flash Player a viewer has available and supply alternative content  in the event that the necessary Player is not available. The alternative content, in this case,  will be a link for the viewer to acquire the appropriate Flash Player, if desired. To assist in  expressInstall of the Player, the .swf will be registered with SWFObject. This method of setting  up Flash Player detection does not require the use of a plugin and gives you easy and direct  access to the generated code.  SWFObject 2.x is an open-source application brought to you by Google. To view the open-source  license for SWFObject 2.x, please visit http:  www.opensource.org licenses mit- license.php. For further information on SWFObject and for another download source for the  files needed to enable it to work, please visit http:  code.google.com p swfobject .  For supplemental information regarding SWFObject 2.x from Adobe, please visit  http:   www.adobe.com devnet flashplayer articles swfobject.html for an article  entitled Detecting Flash Player versions and embedding .swf files with SWFObject 2.0, created  by Bobby Van Der Sluis.   Getting ready In the Chapter 1 folder, make sure that you have access to the following files: swfobject_ test.swf, expressInstall.swf, swfobject.js, and detection_generator.htm.  They are located inside the Detection with SWFObject folder.  Move the swfobject_test.swf, expressInstall.swf, and swfobject.js files to  the root level of your theme folder. Technically, the .swf you are embedding can be located  anywhere, as long as you use the absolute URL in your code.  The detection_generator.htm file holds the open-source application that generates the  necessary Flash Player detection code for you to put into your PHP template.  Be aware that hand coding your live website is a great way to learn and a fast way to work. You  are probably going to make a few mistakes the first time through. It is in your best interest to  have all of your information backed up before editing your site. You may  want to have a text  editing program or a WYSIWYG editor like Dreamweaver to maintain and organize copies of  your files at each stage of development.  Another option is to set up WordPress locally so that the program runs on your computer  instead of a server. XAMPP is a cross-platform utility that can help set up the Apache web  server on your computer. You can download it here: http:  www.apachefriends.org.  The benefit of this approach is that you do not have to upload files via FTP or reload pages to  see the changes you've made. Also, your work in progress will be private—no one will be able  to see your site until you move your completed site from the local install to your server.  16   How to do it...  1.  Open the detection_generator.htm file. To do this, either double click on the file   or drag it onto your web browser icon:  Chapter 1  2.  For the SWFObject configuration section, leave the default settings for SWFObject  .js   as swfobject.js and for Publishing method as Static Publishing. Change Detect Flash  Version to the version of the Flash Player appropriate for your animation. For example,  the default of 9.0.0 is adequate. If you are using the latest and greatest capabilities  of Flash CS4, instead change the version to 10.0.0. Check the box for Adobe Express  Install and leave the file name as it is. This can be seen in the above screenshot.  3.  For the SWF definition section, change the name of the Flash  .swf  to the name  of your .swf file. In this case, change it to: swfobject_test.swf. Dimensions  need to be changed to the width and height of your .swf file. Change this to  320 x 240 pixels. Flash content id can stay as the default.  This can also be seen  in the above screenshot.  17   Leveraging Flash in WordPress  4.  For the HTML definition section, do not change anything. 5.  Click the Generate button to generate the necessary Flash detection code in the  window at the base of the application. Kimili generates the code and puts it into  your WordPress shortcode. The SWFObject 2.x generator gives you direct access to  your code. You then have to copy paste the code to the appropriate location in your  chosen template in WordPress. Your code should look like the following: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:   www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">  <html xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml" lang="en"  xml:lang="en">            <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text html;  charset=iso-8859-1"  >            swfobject.registerObject "myFlashContent", "10.0.0",  "expressInstall.swf" ;                                <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf- 96B8-444553540000" width="320" height="240" id="myFlashContent">                                -->               <object type="application x-shockwave-flash"  data="swfobject_test.swf" width="320" height="240">                                                        <img src="http:  www.adobe.com images shared  download_buttons get_flash_player.gif" alt="Get Adobe Flash  player"  >                                   -->                                                                 6.  Select the   tag in the body section of the code. Everything from   to   7.     gets selected. Copy this  Edit  Copy or Ctrl-C . In the sidebar of your WordPress Dashboard, click on the arrow to the right of  Appearance. Then, click on Editor.  18   Chapter 1  8.  On the right side of the screen, you now have a list of all the templates that are in   the root directory of the Theme folder. Click on the title of the desired .php file. This  loads it in the Theme Editor.  9.  Paste the code you copied from the code generator  Edit  Paste or Ctrl-V  into the  appropriate Template and   tag.  Refer back to Developing a Strategy: Where to  Place a .swf? if needed.  10.  For the head content, select and copy the following:           swfobject.registerObject "myFlashContent", "10.0.0",  "expressInstall.swf" ;      Back in WordPress, open up header.php by clicking on Appearance  Editor  header. php. Paste the selected text in the head section after the   tag and before the    tag.  How it works... The code generator creates the code for you based on the choices you make. It generates  the code within the basic structure of an HTML page. The code generated is web standards  compliant and supports the incorporation of alternative content.  The JavaScript elements in the   section of the .htm generated HTML output accesses  the swfobject.js file. This is a library of JavaScript necessary for the Flash Player version  detection process to take place. The JavaScript elements also register your .swf file with the  library and tell it which version of the Flash Player is needed.  In the body section of the document, a   tag is created that holds the object and nested  object information method that delineates which .swf is to be played, the width and height  of it, and what alternative content to display if the appropriate Flash player version is not  found. Notice that special coding is used to account for the needs of Internet Explorer, for  example:  -->  19   Leveraging Flash in WordPress There's more...  Using relative vs. absolute dimensions If you want have your .swf dimensions relative  in percentages  instead of absolute  in pixels ,  you have two choices:  Choice 1:  1.  Go back into the detection_generator.htm file. 2.  Change the Dimensions to 100 x 100 percentage, as seen below.  3.  Click Generate. 4.  Copy paste your new code as needed.  Choice 2:   In WordPress, change the dimensions in pixels to dimensions in percentages. That section of  code should look like this:  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"  width="100%" height="100%" id="myFlashContent">                              -->              <object type="application x-shockwave-flash"  data="swfobject_test.swf" width="100%" height="100%">                 20   Chapter 1  Dynamic Publishing instead of Static Publishing The default setting for the detection_generator.htm file is for Static Publishing. The other  choice is Dynamic Publishing. Static Publishing is able to reach a larger audience because of  the way it is constructed. There is less dependency on JavaScript. The downside is minimal. As  per Adobe's Bobby Van Der Sluis, Static Publishing does not have a solution for click-to-activate  mechanisms. However, those are already being phased out of use  Internet Explorer and Opera  were the browsers of interest with this . Dynamic Publishing relies more heavily on JavaScript,  even for embedding the .swf file, so the audience reached is smaller. A couple of perks are that  it generates less code and has no issue with click-to-activate mechanisms.  1.  All you have to do to change the publishing method is open the    detection_generator.htm file and change Publishing method to Dynamic  Publishing, as seen below, leave the defaults as desired, and click Generate.  2.  Notice there is slightly different and slightly less code:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:   www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">  <html xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml" lang="en"  xml:lang="en">                        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text html;  charset=iso-8859-1"  >                              var flashvars = {};           var params = {};           var attributes = {};           swfobject.embedSWF "swfobject_test.swf",  "myAlternativeContent", "320", "240", "10.0.0", "expressInstall. swf", flashvars, params, attributes ;                                             21   Leveraging Flash in WordPress              <img src="http:  www.adobe.com images shared download_ buttons get_flash_player.gif" alt="Get Adobe Flash player"  >                                3.  Copy paste the necessary parts of this code into WordPress.        For the head section, copy paste everything from     For the body section, copy paste everything from      Hitting the "More" Button More options are available to you in the SWF definition section of the code generator.   Click the More button to see them  they will look like the image below :  Choose and change Attributes and Parameters here if you would like the generator to create  even more code for you. Many of these options are most useful when the .swf you are  embedding is going to be the sole content of the .html page.  If you are doing a test run, you may want to change the quality setting to low to cut down  on load time. Just remember to turn it back to the default or high when you are ready for  the real deal.  22   Chapter 1  See also   f Using the Kimili plugin to incorporate a .swf  f Adding Flash detection with Flash-generated JavaScript  Adding Flash detection with  Flash-generated JavaScript If you want to add Flash player detection to your web page, but do not want to reference an  external file, this recipe offers an easy solution. Use the Flash Professional IDE to generate the  .html page for you that contains JavaScript to detect a Flash player and will play your .swf.  Then, copy paste the needed code into your template in WordPress.  Getting ready Make sure you have access to the javascript_test.fla file so that you can open the file  and allow Flash to generate additional files in that same location. It is currently located in the  Detection with Flash JavaScript folder inside the folder for Chapter 1. Change the  location of this file as you need.  How to do it...  1.

Boiling down the advantages of WP, we find that it's easy to  update and  when used strategically  can help you get indexed in the major search engines for  your targeted keywords and phrases. Flash is limitless with regards to design  though it takes  time to become proficient with animation software , but a Flash site is not as well understood  by robots and search engines. We introduced the use of two "views" in the WP dashboard— Visual Editor or HTML. Now, we look under the hood for more detail. It is not our intention to  provide here a comprehensive guide to using WP, but instead to share some of our favorite  tips and tricks for setting up WP as a CMS and for working with Flash. Also, we want to  demonstrate ways of working with your site—both the content  posts and pages  and theme  files. We review a number of plugins that extend the WordPress core to help you work smarter.  We'll also show you how to create and implement a SEO strategy in WP to complement your  use of Flash in WP.   Inputting content in the Visual Editor  Getting ready In case you aren't clear on the difference yet, here is a screenshot showing how to navigate  between the Visual or HTML editor for posts and pages:  28   Chapter 2  If you intend to work primarily in the WordPress Visual Editor, there are a few points to keep   in mind.  WP can create XHTML on the fly, making it nearly as easy to update a web page as it is to type  an email. Making website administration available to people who don't know XHTML is a great  leap forward for usability on the Web.  Unfortunately, such auto-generated code can have many undesired formatting issues. Ultimately,  there is no substitute for a basic understanding of the structure and syntax of XHTML.  Even if you plan on primarily using the Visual Editor, there may be times when it is necessary  to take a look at the raw code. One of the most common errors is the accidental inclusion of  unnecessary styles. If the Visual Editor is acting strangely, checking the code for extraneous  tags is the first place to start. See Learning XHTML, at the end of this section, for helpful  resources.  How to do it... Type text directly into WordPress for consistency. It is often preferable to use the Full Screen  mode  a square screen icon to the right of the spell check button; PC: Alt-Shift-G . If you copy  and paste text from a word processor or browser into WP, you may be surprised to see that you  get more than just the text. The font styles  font family, colors, spacing, and so on  and URLs  are included. This may seem  convenient, but often ends up creating more trouble than it is  worth, since it can lead to stylistic inconsistencies.  Copy and paste into HTML view or into a text editor to remove all formatting. Then, re-style   as appropriate.  After entering your text, insert images. Next, apply styles in this order: URLs, bold, unordered  list  bullets , blockquote, indent, heading 2 or heading 3. This will help you to avoid the  unintended application of styles.  29   WordPress: Configuration and Core Plugins  Open up the Kitchen Sink  PC: Alt-Shift-G  to access additional Visual Editor tools. One  important Visual Editor tool is the  pull-down menu that allows you to easily apply headings. Look  for the left-most button in the second row that appears when the Kitchen Sink button is clicked.  Following is a screenshot highlighting the Full Screen Mode and the Kitchen Sink buttons.  How it works... When you input and style content using the Visual Editor, you are not seeing the whole picture.  Keep in mind that additional styles may be applied to your content based on one or more CSS  stylesheets. Inline styles are formatting that get applied before  instead of  the rules from the  CSS stylesheet.  When you copy text from a word processor or browser, the content gets inline  styles that will be prioritized. This can create chaos. A site looks best when it has unity of  design—dissimilar fonts or colors can distract your users and detract from your message.  Most of your styling should be taken care of by CSS. A CSS stylesheet is a library of the special  formatting styles used in your theme. CSS style sheets control the formatting of your content,  and allow for site-wide changes by modifying this library of styles. CSS is most effectively  applied externally—separate from your XHTML. External styles are referenced in between the    and   tags  normally, in a file called header.php  in the following manner:     30   Chapter 2  The best strategy and technique is to use the Visual Editor in conjunction with your CSS  stylesheet, and to mark up content for SEO purposes—to highlight what your content is about.  This means using bold, links, and the h2 and h3 tags to denote emphasis.  Extending the Visual Editor with plugins Depending on your operating system and browser, there is a chance that you or a client may  not be able to use the WordPress Visual Editor. In other cases, you may want more control  over the tools to format web content. In either case, it is possible to extend or replace the WP  WYSIWYG with third-party plugins to achieve your goals.  Getting ready The Visual Editor can be replaced or extended via plugins to give you more control. There were  problems with earlier versions of the Visual Editor in the older versions of Safari that might  also require the use of a third-party plugin.  In early versions of Safari, the visual rich editor would cause the browser to crash  immediately upon loading the Write interface. This was due to a bug in Safari, not  WordPress. Since the WordPress developers had no way of correcting this, they  chose to disable the visual rich editor for Safari users.  From: http:  codex.wordpress.org FAQ_Troubleshooting  Use Safari 3.0.4+ with WordPress 2.3+ to avoid this problem. Or, use the free open-source  browser FireFox  available here:  http:  www.getfirefox.com  . Alternatively, use the  plugin Dean's FCKEditor For Wordpress to replace the WP Visual Editor.  http:  wordpress.org extend plug-ins deans-fckeditor-for-wordpress- plug-in   TinyMCE Advanced is another plugin that extends the Visual Editor, adding additional  formatting options and allowing you to rearrange the buttons in the order you prefer. TinyMCE  Advanced preserves additional buttons  such as the Kimili Flash Embed  added to the WP  Visual Editor, while FCKEditor has its own built-in Flash uploader. If you're using the FCKEditor,  you do not need the Kimili plugin.  How to do it... How to use Dean's FCKEditor  version 2.5.0   1.  Click on Plugins  Add New and search for "FCKEditor". 2.  Click Install and Activate. 3.  Configuration can be found in the dashboard sidebar, under Settings  FCKEditor.  31   WordPress: Configuration and Core Plugins  If you are most often linking to content that is off-site, one suggestion is to set the Default  link Target to New Window  _blank .  This ensures that visitors do not leave your site when visiting another URL, but instead open  another window, as demonstrated below:  Some of the most useful tools available include:  Special Characters, Horizontal Lines, Anchors, Forms, Templates, and Replace.   Another reason to use the FKCEditor is that it allows you to paste from Word—with   auto-detection cleanup.  To switch between HTML view or the FCKEditor Visual Editor, click the Source button,  as seen in the following image.  To upload Flash using the FCKEditor, simply click the Flash logo. If this is difficult to identify,  hover over the buttons for tooltips—look for Insert Edit Flash.  32   Here, we insert our sample Flash animation via Dean's FCKEditor:  Chapter 2  33   WordPress: Configuration and Core Plugins  A handy chart explaining all the buttons on the toolbar can be found here:  http:  docs.fckeditor.net FCKeditor_2.x Users_Guide Quick_Reference  How to use TinyMCE Advanced  version 3.2.4   1.  Click on Plugins  Add New and search for "TinyMCE." 2.  Click Install and Activate. 3.  Configuration can be found in the dashboard sidebar, under   Settings  TinyMCE Advanced.  TincyMCE adds fifteen plugins to the WP Visual Editor. The most useful of these include:  Advanced Image, Advanced Link, Context Menu, Layers, and Paste from Word.  The TinyMCE  Advanced homepage is: http:  www.laptoptips.ca projects tinymce-advanced   How it works... Dean's FCKEditor is based on the FCKEditor, a fast and lightweight open-source application for  creating XHTML 1.0. Dean's FCKEditor is multi-browser compatible, including: IE 5.5+, Safari  3.0, and Firefox 1.0+.  Visit the FCKEditor homepage at: http:  www.fckeditor.net   Extensive documentation for end users and developers is available at:  http:  www.docs.fckeditor.net   TinyMCE uses jQuery to allow you to drag, drop, and arrange buttons on the toolbar. jQuery is  a free, open-source software—a JavaScript library for creating interactive web pages. There  are many ways that jQuery can be used in WordPress and with Flash. For example, a jQuery  plugin exists to embed Flash—this is an alternative to embedding Flash with JavaScript. See:  http:  jquery.com  for more information.  There's more... TinyMCE also acts as a bridge between inline and external styles.  At the bottom of the configuration menu, there is a checkbox to Import the current theme  CSS classes.  34   Chapter 2  This option allows you to format your content by choosing from styles defined in your theme.  Earlier in this chapter  in the How it works section of Inputting content in the Visual Editor , we  pointed out that the Visual Editor doesn't really show you "what you get" because CSS  rules  will be applied based on where your content appears. TinyMCE solves this problem by loading  the CSS rules into the WP Visual Editor, effectively creating a UI to format content using CSS.  Quite an amazing plugin!  It is useful to note the difference between a CSS id and a CSS class, both of which may be  found in a given stylesheet. An ID can be used once on a page; a class can be used as many  times as you want.  IDs have the following syntax: example {propety: value;}  An example of a CSS ID is: mystyle {color: "red";}  Classes have the following syntax: .example {propety: value;}  An example of a CSS class is: .myclass {color: "red";}  Please note that importing the current theme classes does not work for themes that use   @import to load CSS. If your theme does use @import, you can add styles manually to  tadv-mce.css, which can be found inside the tinymce-advanced folder:  tinymce-advanced css.  Add the class names with empty curly braces  not including the properties  using this format:  .example-class-1{}  To get the drop-down menu of Styles to appear in the Visual Editor, make sure to drag and  drop the Styles button onto the toolbar in Settings  TinyMCE Advanced.  Learning XHTML XHTML basics: http:  www.w3schools.com xhtml   Inputting content via the HTML Editor Those comfortable with XHTML will often prefer to use the HTML editor, especially  when checking for errors. The HTML editor can also be a convenient way to mark up your  content—consider hand coding in combination with the use of quicktags.  35   WordPress: Configuration and Core Plugins How to do it... If you prefer to work with XHTML directly, WP provides a handy way of marking up code via  quicktags. Quicktags are buttons in the HTML editor that provide a shortcut to hand coding  XHTML. Simply highlight some text and click the appropriate quicktag button to automatically  create XHTML, as seen below:  The WordPress codex covers quicktags here:  http:  codex.wordpress.org Write_Post_SubPanelQuicktags  If you never want to be bothered with the Visual Editor, disable it by going to Users  Your  Profile. The first checkbox allows you to Disable the visual editor when writing.  You can use TinyMCE Advanced in conjunction with the HTML  editor to gain access to both quicktags and the TinyMCE tools and  customizable toolbar layout.  There's more... It is possible to add to the default list of quicktags and even create your own keyboard  shortcuts to apply your custom tags. The file that creates the default set of quicktags can   be found in the wp-includes folder, named quicktags.js.  Detailed instructions on how to create custom quicktags can be found here:  http:  tamba2.org.uk wordpress quicktags   Editing theme template files in the  Theme Editor Working with content is different than editing the files that make up your theme. A theme is a  "skin"—since the design is separate from the content, you can switch themes and you'll have  a new look, though your content is the same  and you're still using WordPress . The structure  of all WordPress themes is similar. A theme is comprised of a set of PHP files that link to CSS  stylesheets and contain WordPress template tags  to insert entries from the MySQL database   and XHTML.  Like your content, these files can be modified. Additional PHP templates can be created and  uploaded to your theme folder to enhance or customize your theme.  36   Chapter 2  Getting ready The editing of theme templates  PHP files  can be done in several ways. One way is to directly  edit the files live on the server using the WordPress Theme editor. This approach is both fast  and convenient, but suggested for those comfortable with hand coding. Editing template files  in the Theme editor is a good way to see the immediate effects of your changes. It should be  emphasized that creating backups as you customize a theme is absolutely crucial. Backing up  your site, at the end of this chapter, reviews how to do so. XHTML is a precise and unforgiving  medium—one wrong character can break your entire site.  Also, changes can be made in your favorite text editor. You can download the theme files via  FTP, make your changes, and then upload via FTP. This approach is slower, but a bit safer  since you can make a backup file with each change.  How to do it... In the dashboard sidebar, navigate to Apperance  Themes  Editor. You will see a list of the  template files on the right-hand side for the active theme, as well as a drop-down menu to  select any of the other uploaded themes for editing. Clicking on a template file on the right   such as style.css  loads the file into the editor, as seen below:  37   WordPress: Configuration and Core Plugins  Please note that files in subdirectories are not shown. To edit files in a theme subfolder  for  example,  includes , you will need to download the files via FTP, edit with a text editor, then  upload the modified file via FTP.  Before making a change to any theme template, do yourself a favor and make a backup of  the file you are editing. An easy way to do this is to select all  PC: Ctrl-A Mac: Cmd-A  in the  Theme editor, and paste the original code into a text editor.  Proceed with caution—and have fun!  How it works... When you make changes to code, the best practice is to comment your code to make a record  of the change. You can comment out a section of XHTML or CSS, but not PHP. Doing so means  that the code will not be displayed.  A comment within a line is declared with a special    tag—which in XHTML means do  not display. Use this approach within template files to comment out XHTML.     Comments that take up multiple lines are declared with  * * .  Use this approach in the  stylesheet to comment out CSS.     * Optional: section of information.  Maybe steps, for example: Step 1. Step 2.   *   Template hierarchy It takes a little time to become familiar with how templates are triggered in WordPress, though  the structure is meant to be logical and easy to grasp. Since your WP site serves up dynamic  content, different templates are called based on the URL or where a user clicks. For example,  home.php gets called before index.php on the homepage. A single post will use single. php, or if this is not available, index.php. If a user clicks on a tag, WP will look for tag.php,  then archive.php, then index.php. This flexible structure allows you to create templates  as needed.  Visit the WP codex for a complete overview of the WP template hierarchy:  http:  codex.wordpress.org Template_Hierarchy  Configuring WP for maximum SEO Default WordPress settings provide a reasonable level of SEO utility. Compared to a static  tables-based site or a Flash site, even the default settings are substantially more powerful.  Configuring these settings maximizes the SEO potential of WP.  38   Chapter 2  Getting ready Permalinks control the URL structure of the content on your site. The default structure   http:  www.wordpressandflash.com ?p=123 should not be used. Instead,  configure shorter "pretty" permalinks that describe your content.  How to do it... To update, configure permalinks that create user friendly SEO URLs. Take the following steps:  In the WP dashboard sidebar, click on Settings  Permalinks.  1.  2.  Click on Day and name. 3.  Click on the Custom Structure field, which will now be loaded with the following:   %year% %monthnum% %day% %postname%  4.  Truncate this to the following:  %postname%  5.  Click Save Changes.  For more information, visit: http:  codex.wordpress.org Using_Permalinks  How it works... The preferred hosting environment for WordPress is an Apache server, such as bluehost.com.  In this environment, WordPress can automatically update your .htaccess file.  What is a .htaccess file? .htaccess files  or "distributed configuration files"  provide a way to make  configuration changes on a per-directory basis. From: http:  httpd.apache.org docs 1.3 howto htaccess.html  Most simply, and in plain English, a .htaccess file allows you to create redirection rules for  individual files or directories, including for an entire site. In a preferred hosting environment,  WordPress can automatically update the .htaccess file. This means that each time you  update your permalink structure, WordPress will make sure that the old URLs point to the   new URLs.  If WP cannot automatically update your .htaccess file, it is most likely due to file  permissions. The easiest way to update file permissions is to connect to your server via FTP  and click on the file or directory for which you would like to update the permission. Right-click   PC  or Cmd-click  Mac  for the file permissions context menu. Enter or select 777 for read  write execute.  39   WordPress: Configuration and Core Plugins  A few notes for those of you who would like to work with the .htaccess file directly:   f Your .htaccess file must be located in your site's root directory  f .htaccess files must be uploaded as ASCII—not Binary  f .htaccess is the complete file name—depending on what text editor you are using,  it may or may not support saving a file name with no extension. Don't worry—you can  save as a text file and rename when you FTP.  There's more... Configure WP to automatically ping blog search engines each time you update content.   Here are the steps:  In the WP dashboard sidebar, click on Settings  Writing.  1.  2.  At the bottom of the screen, click on the link to Update Services on the Codex. 3.  Scroll down to the  XML-RPC Ping Services and highlight and copy the entire list. 4.  Click back in your browser to return to the Writing Settings page. 5.   In the Update Services field, replace the single entry   http:  rpc.pingomatic.com   with the full list.

Using the Google XML Sitemaps plugin We've already configured WP to automatically notify the major blog search engines each  time you update or publish content. Wouldn't it be nice to do the same for the major search  engines such as Google, Bing, Ask.com, and Yahoo? The same XML technology can be  used to create a sitemap, or a list of pages on your site available to users and crawlers. The  good news is that you can leverage a WP plugin to do so with a few clicks. The Google XML  Sitemaps plugin is authored by Arne Brachhold  ,  the homepage is: http:  www.arnebrachhold.de redir sitemap-home *  How to do it...  Install and activate: Install  Install Now  Activate Plugin.  1.  To add a new plugin, navigate to: Plugins  Add New. 2.  Search for "Google XML". 3.  4.  Visit the plugin configuration panel: Settings  XML-Sitemap. 5.  Make sure to click: Click here to build it the first time. 6.  The default settings are  sufficient for most users.  How it works... The XML sitemap is a list of all the content on your site. The name is sitemap.xml and it is  located in your root directory.  An XML Sitemap is particularly important for a WordPress site, as discussed on the Wikipedia  entry for site maps: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Site_map  Some sites have a large number of dynamic pages that are only available through  the use of forms and user entries. The sitemap files can then be used to indicate to  a web crawler how such pages can be found.  41   WordPress: Configuration and Core Plugins There's more... Remember that WordPress is a form of dynamic publishing, using PHP. There are no static  pages—instead, content is dynamically generated each time a page is loaded. The sitemap  ensures that crawlers can find all of the content available on your site. All major search  engines support and use the XML sitemap format. There is no guarantee that all your pages  will be crawled, neither does an XML sitemap guarantee inclusion in any directory, nor a  certain page rank. The sitemap is the most contemporary and effective way of communicating  with search engines about the content and structure of your site. For this reason, it is   highly recommended.  Using the SEO Title Tags plugin   Version 2.3.3  The following section shows you how to use the SEO Title Tags plugin.  Getting ready Metatags, like CSS stylesheets, are located in the head of a page—between the    and   tags. Metatags are supporting information that is not directly displayed, but  describes or produces the page. Think of the head like your entry in the card catalog at the  library—metatags are entries that define the language, subject, author, and so on. The title tag  produces the browser title—text displayed at the top of the window, before the page content.  One important factor for on-site SEO is the   tag, a HTML tag.  The title tag has the following structure:   Your title here   Titles should be defined for each page on your site. The default WordPress setting is to display  the post title as the title tag. This is less than ideal: your post or page titles are for humans   to describe your content , whereas the title tag is mostly used by search engines  to index a  given URL . As Stephan Spencer, the author of the SEO Title Tag plugin notes on the plugin  homepage http:  www.netconcepts.com seo-title-tag-plug-in :  ...post titles should be catchy, pithy, and short-and-sweet; whereas title tags should  incorporate synonyms and alternate phrases to capture additional search visibility.  The SEO title tag plugin allows you to easily define unique title tags for every post, page,  category, and tag. The mass edit layout conveniently displays all the title tags in one page for  instant cross referencing and comparison.  42   How to do it...  Chapter 2  1.  Click on Plugins  Add New and search for "SEO Title Tag". 2.  Click Install and Activate. 3.  The first step is to replace the default WordPress titles with the SEO title tag. Navigate   to the Theme editor  Appearance  Editor  and click on header.php. Search for the  word "title"  PC: Ctrl-F Mac: Cmd-F . The default title will look something like this:     4.  Replace the default title tag with this call to the plugin:   <?php if  function_exists 'seo_title_tag'   { seo_title_ tag  ; } else { bloginfo 'name' ; wp_title  ;} ?>   5.  Make sure to save your work by clicking Update File. This code ensures that the SEO   title tag will be used, if available. If not, the default WP title will be used.  6.  Next, visit the plugin configuration page: Settings  SEO Title Tag. Here, you can   specify defaults for the plugin. The preconfigured settings should work for most users.  If you have a lot of content, you may want to display more than 20 posts   \per page.  7.  Lastly, visit the Title Tag tool: Tools  Title Tags. This is the reason we installed this   plugin—to take advantage of the super useful interface allowing you to see and  modify all your titles at once. The UI is conveniently broken down by Pages, Posts,  Categories, Tags, and URLs.  How it works... The SEO title tag plugins allows you to mass edit your titles. The brilliance of this plugin is the  ability to conceptualize and modify the whole set of titles at once. If you only work on one part  of your SEO strategy, filling the title tags with your targeted keywords and phrases would be  the area on which to focus.  43   WordPress: Configuration and Core Plugins  The plugin adds three tables to your MySQL database:  wp_seo_title_tag_category, wp_seo_title_tag_tag, and wp_seo_title_ tag_url  Each existing WP category, tag, or URL is paired with a new field—the SEO title tag. When the  page loads, the plugin checks the table for a match and outputs the SEO title tag.  Using the Breadcrumb NavXT plugin   Version 3.2.1  Breadcrumb NavXT homepage: http:  mtekk.weblogs.us code breadcrumb-navxt   Breadcrumb navigation is a visual representation of where you are in the site. A common  format is: Blog  About.  Your Categories and Pages should be highly related to your keywords. Repeating this info  on each page and as a link helps to emphasize to search engines what your site is about.  As we've learned, words that are links get extra SEO weight. For these reasons, breadcrumb  navigation is a useful SEO strategy. Breadcrumb navigation is also useful for your human  users because it helps orient them to the structure of your site and the ability to "drill down"   to see content.  How to do it...  1.  Click on Plugins  Add New and search for "Breadcrumb". 2.  Click Install and Activate.  Identify the location to insert breadcrumb navigation using Firebug. Since search engines  give more weight to words at the top of your page, near the top is a common approach. If you  insert the code into your header.php, breadcrumb navigation will appear on every page.  Navigate to the Theme editor  Appearance  Editor  and  in most cases  click on header.php.  Insert the following code:    <?php if function_exists 'bcn_display'   {    bcn_display  ; } ?>     44   For our example  using the default Kubrik theme , we open index.php and place the  breadcrumb code immediately after: <div id="content" class="narrowcolumn"  role="main">  The end result looks like this:  Chapter 2  How it works... Administration takes place under Settings  Breadcrumb NavXT. Here, you can control how the breadcrumb titles are formed and displayed. The format is a  table, with additional tabs. First entry on the General tab is: Breadcrumb Separator -- the  default value is: &gt; This is a special HTML character code, producing the greater than symbol ">." A list of HTML  character codes can be found here: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki List_of_XML_ and_HTML_character_entity_references  In this example, we use the alternate character code to produce the greater than symbol: &62;  45   WordPress: Configuration and Core Plugins  You can also set special rules for the homepage breadcrumb. The Home Anchor field sets the  tooltip for the link to the homepage—the text that appears when a user hovers over the link. By  modifying the Home title and Home Anchor, we get the following effect:  The rest of the tabs allow you to set custom behaviors for breadcrumbs. The Current Item  tab allows you to set options for the current page. For example, you could add " you are here "  for the Current Item Suffix. You can use HTML in these fields—for example,   you are  here  .  Also, it is possible to configure special behaviors for Posts & Pages, Categories, Tags, and  Date Archives.  Use Google Analytics in WordPress Our final SEO recommendation is to use Google Analytics  GA . Though the benefit of  knowing something about your visitors and how they use your site may be clear, it may not be  immediately obvious how this is an SEO practice. The answer is simple: Analytics data is the  feedback loop by which you fine tune or revise your SEO strategy. Once your site is designed  and launched, we suggest you adjust your SEO practices based on the real-world results.  How to do it... Google Analyticator  Version 5.1  is our recommended plugin.  1.  Click on Plugins  Add New and search for "Analyticator". 2.  Click Install and Activate.  You will need to sign up for an Analytics account and associate a URL with it:  http:  www.google.com analytics   46   Chapter 2  3.  You do not need to copy the tracking code that is automatically generated at the   completion of the sign-up and website profile creation process. Visit your Analytics  homepage and copy the UA number  directly to the right of the website profile name  of your WP site .  4.  Back at your WP dashboard, click on Settings  Google Analytics. 5.  Paste your user-specific code into the Google Analytics UID field. 6.   In the Google Analytics logging is: drop-down menu, select Enabled. Click Save  Changes, and you are ready to go!  How it works... GA provides you with quite a bit of information. You select any range of days for which stats  are available, and Graph your data by Day, Week, or Month. In Table view, you can sort your  data by clicking on a column heading, as shown below.  In brief, you might want to review the following areas:  Traffic Sources: How users came to visit your site  a search engine, referring site, or entering  the URL directly   Visitors  Map Overlay: A geographical representation of your user base  Content  Content By Title: Cross reference your title tags with your statistics  47   WordPress: Configuration and Core Plugins Backing up your site Backing up your site is absolutely essential, especially for those for those of us who enjoy  coding and customizing our site and theme. Here, we outline a strategy to back up your  content in three parts: WordPress content in XML format, themes, plugins, uploads, and  configuration files via FTP, and SQL backup via plugin.  Getting ready WP-DBManager  Version 2.50  is our plugin recommendation. This excellent plugin was  contributed by veteran WP plugin developer Lester "Gamerz" Chan. In addition to creating  database backups, you can also optimize your database and restore an existing backup. You  can even repair a database, add or drop tables, or run an SQL query from the WP dashboard.  How to do it... To back up your content, you will need to download a file in XML format that contains your  posts, pages, comments, custom fields, categories, and tags for all authors. Since your  content is separate from your design, a backup in this format will allow you to import your   data  only  into another WP installation, should you ever have the need.  In the WP dashboard sidebar, click: Tools  Export.  1.  2.  Then: Download Export File. 3.  Next, a backup via FTP. 4.   In the root directory, save copies of your wp-config.php file and the  .htaccess file, if you have one.  5.  Also, copy the entire  wp-content directory to back up your theme,   plugins, and uploads.  Back up your MySQL database with the WP-DBManager plugin:  1.  Click on Plugins  Add New and search for "WP-DBManager". 2.  Click Install and Activate. Once the plugin is installed and activated, navigate to the   Database menu at the bottom of the dashboard sidebar.  3.  Click Backup. The default backup location is wp-content backup-db. This can   be changed from Database  DB Options. Here, you can also schedule automatic  database backups and optimization, as well as explore more advanced interactions  with your MySQL database.  4.  Make sure to download a copy of your database to your computer, or have the backup   emailed to you by visiting Databse  Manage Backup DB.  48   Chapter 2  How it works... Now, you have a copy of your theme and any modifications you've made. This allows you to  utilize your design on another WP installation, or roll back your theme to a previous state.  The .htaccess and wp-config.php files will allow you to recreate your site in a fresh  WP install, should you ever have the need. wp-config.php is your admin key to WP. This  file contains your MySQL database, username, and password. Keep it in a secure place.  .htaccess is a record of all your permalink redirects—with this file, you ensure that any old  bookmarks of extinct URLs will point to the updated content  WP does this automatically .  The  wp-content folder contains your modified theme files, plugins, and uploads.  The backup of your SQL database is like a snapshot in time—it contains everything except the  WordPress software and the files you've uploaded  plugins and themes . Restoring a database  will overwrite all your data, including the posts, pages, categories and comments. This is  useful when moving from one server to another, in the event of hacking or other catastrophes.  Restoration is a snap with the WP-DBManager plugin. Click on Database  Manage Backup  DB, select the desired backup and click the Restore button.  You can also import the SQL file via PhpMyAdmin. Here is a video showing you how to do this:  http:  www.dewahost.com tutorials cpanelx importsqlfile.html  49   3  Image Galleries and  Slideshows—Using  Plugins and Flash  In this chapter, we will cover the following:   f Importing your photos from Flickr: Simple Flickr plugin  f Using lightbox effects: WordPress Multibox plugin  f Creating effects in Flash  f Using Flash to create watermarks  f Using image thumbnails, galleries, and watermarking: NextGen Gallery plugin  f Building an image gallery in Flash in a timeline  f Building an image gallery in Flash with XML  f Adding slideshows: featured content gallery plugin  f Building a basic slideshow in Flash in a timeline  f Building a slideshow in Flash with XML   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash Introduction Images are a major part of almost every site. In this chapter, we show you ways to share  individual images and collections of images as thumbnails, galleries, and slideshows using  WordPress plugins or working in Flash.  Two concepts we will be working with are DRM and XML:   f DRM stands for Digital Rights Management or Digital Restrictions Management. DRM  is a strategy that limits how people can use your content. Anything you put on a public  website is potentially up for grabs, so the best strategy is to share only what you want  to be made publicly available. The watermarking of images, the compositing of a  copyright  image or text  onto an image, is a common DRM strategy. We will show you  how to watermark images using a WP  WordPress  plugin or in Flash. Knowing how to give proper credit for images that are not your own is also essential.  The MLA standard for citing a website includes the following:  username. imagename. Day Month Year  .  f We suggest you do not use the carats when publishing online  as it conflicts with the   use of the carat as a tag for XHTML . Instead, encode them correctly using special  characters. See Chapter 2, Using the Breadcrumb NavXT  plugin, the How it  works… section.   f XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It is closely related to XHTML,   Extensible Hypertext Markup Language, which is HTML that conforms to   XML standards.   f An RSS feed, which is a list of the most recent content on a website, is an example of  an XML file. The list must show  at minimum  the title, URL, description, and content.  If you are using "pretty" permalinks, WP sets up an RSS feed for you automatically at:  http:  yourdomain.com feed. If you are using default permalinks, the RSS feed  can be accessed at: http:  yourdomain.com ?feed=rss. WordPress actually configures four types of feeds automatically.  For more  information, see: http:  codex.wordpress.org WordPress_Feeds.   f XML and XHTML work together to allow automated processes to occur. Some   examples include these:    Notifying your RSS feed subscribers about new content Importing an RSS feed of images to display on your site   Pulling data from a file to be animated in a .swf      f Using XML to populate your .swf makes updating images in your .swf very   easy. Swapping images can be done painlessly and swiftly by you or by a client   who has little or no knowledge of ActionScript  or even of XML . All you have to do   is change the file names in the XML file. Often, this benefits you after the project   is competed and makes the extra prep and knowledge required to build these   Flash-XML bridges worthwhile.  52   A note about images for the Web: .gif and .png files are often used for  transparent images or images with solid blocks of color. .jpg is preferable  for photos.  Chapter 3  Importing your photos from Flickr:  Simple Flickr plugin  Version 1.1  Image sharing is a key feature of many sites. Flickr is a popular and convenient tool to use to  organize and share photos. The Flickr Photo Album plugin makes it easy to display your   photos from Flickr on your WP blog.  Three advantages of this plugin are that you can do the following:   f Create a WP image gallery from Flickr so users will not have to leave your site to see    your Flickr photos   f Insert Flickr galleries in posts or pages via handy WYSIWYG buttons  f Insert Flickr images in a sidebar  Getting ready The plugin can be installed using the Plugins   Add New section of the WP admin interface  and searching for "Flickr Photo Album." Alternatively, you can download the plugin from its  homepage:  http:  tantannoodles.com toolkit photo-album   Update your permalinks, otherwise the plugin will not work  see Chapter 2, Configuring WP  for maximum SEO .  Make sure to have your Flickr login and password handy.  How to do it...  Install and activate the plugin.  1.  2.  Visit the configuration page for the plugin: Settings  Photo Album. 3.  Click on Flickr API key— this will take you to your Flickr account. 4.  Copy and paste the Flickr API Key and Shared Secret into the appropriate fields.   Make sure you do not have any extra spaces in either field.  5.  Click Next. 6.  Step 1: Click on Retrieve Flickr Permissions.  53   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  7.  You will see two messages. The correct choice reads: If you arrived at this page   because you specifically asked to connect to your Flickr account, click here.  Click Next.  8.  Click OK I'LL AUTHORIZE IT. 9.  You will see a verification message: You have successfully authorized the application. 10.  Under Flickr Settings, look for Photo Album Syndication. 11.  Under Photo Albums, click on Organize Albums. 12. Click Yes, display my Flickr Albums on this blog. 13.  Enter the location of the post or page you have in mind. For example, you could    enter flickr.  14.  Click Save Settings. 15.  This takes you to Flickr.com. Drag and drop your images to create a new album. Make   sure to give your album a title and description.  16.  Then, back in WordPress, click Refresh All Albums. 17.  Click Save Settings.  Now, you have an image gallery from Flickr that is viewable  and cached  on your own site. The  image gallery includes a slideshow feature; here is what it looks like:  54   There's more... Perhaps you want to add a photo  or selection of photos  from your photostream, albums, or  from another Flickr user into a WP post or page. All you have to do is click on the Flickr button  in the WYSIWYG.  Adding your Flickr photos to the sidebar is a snap.  Make sure that under Settings  Photo Album  the Flickr Settings, Flickr Sidebar Widget  has a check mark to Enable the Flickr Widget for your sidebar.  Admin your sidebar by visiting Appearance  Widgets.  Chapter 3  55   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  Simply drag and drop the Flickr Sidebar widget. Click on the downward pointing arrow to   the right of the widget title to expand—then, choose how many photos to display. The Sidebar  should look like this:  Other plugins  photos    f Facebook Photos plugin: http:  tantannoodles.com toolkit facebook-   f Flickr Manager plugin: http:  tgardner.net wordpress-flickr-manager   f Flickr Tag plugin: http:  www.webopticon.com archives 148  More information To learn about working with lightbox effects, visit the advanced configuration overview located  at the subversion repository for the plugin: http:  code.google.com p photo-album  wiki Documentation  Specifically, see the section labeled Popup Overlay Support.  56   Chapter 3  Using lightbox effects: WordPress  Multibox plugin  Version 1.3.8  A lightbox is a way of displaying a gallery of images. A user clicks on a single photo, and  without taking the user from the page, a full-screen gallery and slideshow takes place. A user  can browse the gallery and exit the lightbox window. Our Flickr slideshow from the previous  section is an example of a lightbox.  The WordPress Multibox plugin allows you to conveniently share multimedia from your WP  blog with lightbox elegance and utility. It is a useful and free tool that works with the following  file types:   f Images in .jpg, .bmp, .png, and .gif formats  f Flash video  .flv   f Flash animations  .swf     f MP3 music files  .mp3   f HTML files  f PDF files  f Windows Media Video  .wmv   Visit the plugin's English home page at http:  www.rutschmann.biz php-mysql- javascript-und-ajax wordpress-multibox-plugin-en  Getting ready Prepare your thumbnail and full-screen image files. The thumbnail can be up to the maximum  size allowed by the container div as long as you keep in mind that CSS styles such as margin,  padding, and border will constrain the total space available. Use Firefox to inspect, prepare,  and revise. The full-screen version can be up to 1024 pixels—this will support most screen  resolutions.  How to do it...  Install the plugin by visting Plugins  Add New. Search for "multibox."  1.  2.  After you activate the plugin, visit its configuration page at Settings  Multibox. 3.  Make sure to visit each of the four submenus:    General options   Design options   Handle PDF Files in the Multibox     Slideshow  57   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  4.  To use the plugin, simply link to an image. As an example, we will insert an    5.  Use the Media Uploader to upload and insert the thumbnail, as is shown in    image into a post.  this example:  6.  Set the Link URL field automatically by clicking on the File URL button. Then, click   insert into post.  7.  Next, upload the large full-screen version using the same WP media uploader.  58   Chapter 3  8.   If you switch to HTML view now, all you have to do is modify the   tag  the  link  to point to the large file—in our example, from ycb2009.jpg to ycb2009_ lg.jpg: <a href="http:  www.wordpressandflash.com wp-content  uploads 2009 07 ycb2009_lg.jpg"><img src="http:  www. wordpressandflash.com wp-content uploads 2009 07 ycb2009. jpg" alt="ycb2009" title="ycb2009" width="450" height="46"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31"  >   How it works... When using the default settings, the WordPress Multibox plugin takes over the link  behavior for the media file types listed above. Essentially, any image file, .flv or .swf,  .pdf, .htm, .mp3, or .wmv that you wrap in an   tag will be shown in the lightbox.  For this reason, the Multibox plugin is not compatible with some other image plugins, such   as the NextGen gallery.  There's more... If you don't want lightbox effects for every piece of media that is a  link, make the appropriate  changes to the General options.  To enable lightbox effects for a specific link, simply add the mb class to the link:  class="mb".  To size the lightbox window for a specific link, use the rel="" attribute, like this:   rel="width:960,height:800".  59   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  A complete example using both:  <a class="wmp" rel="width:960,height:800" href="http:  some_domain_or_ image_or_etc">This link opens in a lightbox!   See also   f Image thumbnails, galleries, and watermarking: NextGen gallery plugin  Creating effects in Flash It is easy to create effects such as drop shadows and bevels in Flash. These are technically  referred to as filters. Filters can be applied to text, movie clips, and buttons. If you wish to  apply a filter to another type of element, such as an imported bitmap image, convert it to a  movie clip first.  How to do it...  1.   In the Flash Professional IDE, create a new file: File  New Choose Flash File   ActionScript 3.0 .  2.  Create an element of text, a movie clip, or a button as needed.  To create text, use the Type Tool, set the properties  such as font size  in the  Properties Panel, click once on the Stage, and type something.   To create a movie clip, select any shape s  or bitmap image s , go to Modify   Convert to Symbol  F8 , select Movie Clip, name the movie clip as needed,  and hit OK. To create a button, select any shape s  or bitmap image s , go to Modify   Convert to Symbol  F8 , select Button, name the button as needed, and hit OK.   Double click on the button symbol instance on the Stage to isolate it and view  its timeline.  Edit the symbol so that it has a minimum of an Up state and a  Hit state. The easiest way to accomplish this is to select the frame for the Hit  state and insert a frame  F5 . Here is an example of the timeline:  3.  Make sure you select the item you are applying the filter to.  60   4.   In the Properties panel, click on the Filters tab to view the Filters options if not  already visible.  5.  Click on the New Filter button at the bottom of the Filters section to access of the list   of filters. The list of filters consists of the following:  Chapter 3    Drop Shadow Blur     Glow Bevel     Gradient Glow   Gradient Bevel    Adjust Color  6.  Click on one of these options to apply that filter. 7.  To edit the filter, adjust the value settings for the different properties listed. 8.  As an example, select Drop Shadow. You get the following settings:  61   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  9.  Adjust Blur X and Y to make the shadow more feathered fuzzy. Higher numbers   make it fuzzier.  10.  Adjusting the Strength adjusts the opacity of the shadow. Lower percentages are   more transparent. If there are other elements behind the shadow, the color of those  elements will be affected by the color and opacity of the shadow.  11.  Quality is how well the shadow is rendered. You have Low, Medium, and High to   choose from. See what looks best and still meets your target file size and load time to  maintain your frame rate in complex animations.  12.  Angle comes in degrees and determines the location of the shadow in relation to the   shape creating the shadow. You can think of it in terms of the position of the light  source. The range is from zero to 360 degrees. We recommend consistency between  shadowed shapes. If you use 45 degrees on one shape on your page, use 45 degrees  on all the shapes on your page.  13.  Knockout gives you a checkbox. Check the box. The shape, whether it is text, a movie   clip, or a button, will be knocked out, or hidden. However, the shadow still shows up  as if the shape were still present, just invisible.  14.  Inner Shadow is a checkbox as well. Check the box, and the shadow shows up inside  the shape rather than outside of it. Make sure that the shape or text to which you are  applying the inner shadow is large enough for this to look reasonable.  15.  Hide Object is another checkbox. Check the box, and the result is that the shape  is hidden so that the entire shadow is shown. The shape is not knocked out, just  turned invisible.  16.  Color allows you to choose an alternate color for the shadow. Click the box of color for   access to the color swatches and picker. Choose the color you desire.  17.  Adjust the settings as needed, as shown below.  62   Chapter 3  18.  Save the file. Go to File  Export  Export Movie to create the file format you need.   Testing the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return  will generate a SWF.  There's more... A single text element, movie clip, or button can have more than one filter applied to it. It is also  possible to enable and disable different filters to compare and contrast the effects of each  separately and together. Beyond that, if you really do not like a filter you chose, by all means  delete it! Each of these tasks are completed using the buttons at the base of the Filter section  in the Properties panel:  In addition to more filters, other types of visual effects can be applied manually.   Also discussed below is how to add a border.  Adding, enabling disabling, and deleting filters More than one filter can be added to a single element.  1.  Simply click on the New Filter button again, and select a different filter from the list.  Be cautious with adding too many filters to one element. It is easy to get  carried away and enter the Land of Cheese.  2.  To turn off a filter, select it. Then click on the enable or disable Filter button. It looks   like an eyeball at the base of the panel. It is a toggle.  3.  To delete a filter, select it. Then click on the trash-can icon at the base of the panel. 4.  To reset the filter settings back to their defaults, select the filter. Then click on the   Reset Filter button at the base of the panel. It looks like an arrow turning back   on itself.  63   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash Adding borders and exporting as a series of JPG Files There may often be times that you want to have a border on an image. There is not a filter in  Flash that makes hard borders. This must be accomplished manually. Again, this works best  if all of the images are of the same dimensions. If the images differ in size, you will have more  work to do, but the process is essentially the same.  While similar results can be achieved in programs such as Adobe Photoshop or similar image  editing programs, this method allows you to see what each JPG will look like before you  commit to it. You can know that each image will turn out well because you get to see them  quickly and easily in one file before you have Flash save them separately for you. This can  speed up your design process because guesswork is eliminated.  To quickly create a border on more than one image and export as JPG files, do the following:  1.  Put the files you want to apply a border to into one folder. 2.  Name these files sequentially  i.e. - pic_01.jpg, pic_02.jpg, pic_03.jpg, and   so on . You are also welcome to use the demo files in the Chapter 3 images folder. In Flash, create a file that has a layer reserved for images  name it images .  3.  4.  Select the key frame on the images layer. 5.  Go to File  Import  Import to Stage  Ctrl Cmd R . 6.  Navigate to and select only the first file in the sequence. Again, feel free to    use the images in the Chapter 3 images folder.  7.  Hit Import, and you should get the following dialog box:  8.  Select Yes. The images will all be placed into the selected layer, one key frame   after another.  9.  Select one of the images, and look at the Properties panel to get the dimensions   of the selected image. It should be in the Position and Size option as W: and H: for  width and height.  10.  Create a new layer above the images layer. Name it border. This layer should end   up having the same duration  the same number of frames  as the images layer.  64   Chapter 3  11.  Use the Rectangle Tool to create a rectangle with a stroke and no fill. Use the color   swatches in the Tool Box to select a stroke color and no fill  the white box with the red  line through it . The default stroke weight is 1px. This is the norm for border thickness.   It can be edited in the Properties panel's Fill and Stroke section as required.  12. With the rectangle selected, set the width and height of it to match the dimensions   of your images. If all of your images are the same dimensions, your work here is,  basically, complete.  If you have images of different dimensions, create key frames on the border  layer that line up with images  hit F6 . Resize the rectangles as needed.  13.  Go to Document  Page Properties  Ctrl Cmmd J , and make the stage match the   dimensions of the contents.  14.  Save the Flash file. It is always good to have a master copy. 15.  Go to File  Export  Export Movie. It should look like the following:  16.  Choose a location to export the files to, such as a folder on your desktop. 17.  For Format, choose JPG Sequence.  If you need a different file format, this is the step in which to choose it.  18.  Hit Save.  65   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  19.  The following dialog box appears with JPG setting options:  20. Choose the settings you need, such as a higher or lower setting for Quality. Flash will   render each frame of your Flash movie into an individual JPG file. 21.  Upload these images into WordPress where and how you need to.  Using Flash to create watermarks Watermarks are a low visual impact way to inform viewers of ownership of your images. They  help to dissuade copyright infringement and outright image thievery. If you have an image or a  design that you want to put your mark on, Flash makes it easy.  Getting ready Have one or more images that you want to test a watermark on available to you. A JPG file will  work well. If you do not have any images, use Flash's drawing tools to create something. There  are also images available to you in the Chapter 3 images folder.  How to do it...  1.  Create a new file: File  New Flash File  ActionScript 3.0  for example. 2.   Import a file: File  Import  Import to Stage  Ctrl Cmmd R . If you get a dialog box  asking if you want to import more than one image  an entire sequence of images, for  example , select No. If you do not get the dialog box, that is fine.  3.  Use Modify  Page Properties  Ctrl Cmmd J  to adjust the stage size as desired.  Check the box for Match: Contents if you want the stage to exactly match the size  and position of the placed image file.  66   Chapter 3  4.  The imported image should be on Layer 1 in the timeline. Rename that layer image  to help keep the contents of your layer clear. To rename a layer, double click on the  current name of it so that you can type.  5.  Make a new layer. Name the new layer watermark. 6.  Select the first  and, at this point, only  key frame in the watermark layer. 7.  Grab the Type tool. Select the text settings you want in the Properties panel. The size  of the image dictates the font size. You will be best off using font that is easy to read  and consists of substantial characters. Try Arial Black over Arial, for instance.  8.  Type: copyright your name year  for example:   Sarah Soward 2009 .  To insert the copyright symbol   in Flash, hold down Alt 0169 Option G.  9.  With the text selected, open the Filters section of the Properties panel if it is not   already open.  10.  Click on the New Filter button, and select Bevel. 11.  For Arial Black font at 20 to 36 points, try using the following Bevel Filter settings.   You are welcome to experiment with other fonts, font sizes, and bevel filter settings. If  more than one image is receiving a watermark, it is in your best interest to make the  watermarks match:  67   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  12. If you want your watermark to go diagonally across the image, grab the Free   Transform Tool.  13.  With the text selected, move the tool just to the outside of any corner of the    resulting bounding box around the text.  14.  Click and drag in the direction you wish to rotate. 15.  To constrain the rotation to 45 degree increments, hold down Shift as you rotate. 16.  Save the file. Go to Control  Test Movie  Ctrl Cmmd Return  to create the SWF.   Embed into WordPress at your leisure.  How it works... In Flash, a layer on top of another in the timeline equates to an element visually on top of  another in your document. Any image can be placed below the watermark layer to have the  watermark apply to it. The watermark is mostly transparent because the Knockout box is  checked in the Bevel filter. This keeps the impact of the watermark low enough that viewers  are not overly distracted by it. However, it still marks the image clearly.  There's more... It is possible to create watermarks for multiple images in Flash. This processing of multiple  files is where the power of Flash is most useful. You can also export the multiple images   as a sequence of JPG files. If needed, you can export as a sequence of GIF, PICT, or PNG   files as well. Photographs often look best as JPG files. GIF and PNG files work great for  graphic vector work.  Watermarking multiple images and exporting as JPG Files To quickly mark more than one image and export as JPG files, do the following:  1.  Put the files needing watermarks into one folder. This works best if all of the images   have the same dimensions.  2.  Name these files sequentially  i.e. - pic_01.jpg, pic_02.jpg, pic_03.jpg, and   3.   so on . You are also welcome to use the demo files in the Chapter 3 image folder. In Flash, create a file that has a layer reserved for images  name it images  and a  layer above that with your watermark on it. 4.  Select the key frame on the images layer. 5.  File  Import  Import to Stage  Ctrl Cmmd R . 6.  Navigate to and select only the first file in the sequence. 7.  Hit Import, and you should get the following dialog box:  68   8.  Select Yes. The images will all be placed into the selected layer, one key frame   after another. In the watermark layer  and any other layer you may have for design purposes ,   select the frame that lines up with the last key frame in the images layer.  9.   10.  Insert a frame  F5  so that the watermark shows up over each photo. 11.  Save the Flash file. It is always good to have a master copy. 12. Go to File  Export  Export Movie, shown below:  13.  Choose a location to export the files to, such as a folder on your desktop. 14.  For Format, choose JPG Sequence.  If you need a different file format, this is the step in which to choose it.  Chapter 3  69   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  15.  Hit Save. The following dialog box appears with JPG setting options:  16.  Flash will render each frame of your Flash movie into an individual JPG file. 17.  Upload these images into WordPress where and how you need to.

A   confirmation appears: Gallery portfolio successfully created. You can show this gallery with the tag  [nggallery id=1].  5.  Then, visit Upload Images to add images to your gallery.  6.   In the Upload image field, click on Browse. You can repeat this step as many  times as you want to add multiple images. In the in to field, pull down to select the appropriate gallery.  7.  8.  Click Upload Images. 9.  Visit Gallery  Manage Gallery to work with your new gallery. 10.  You will see a list of all the existing galleries—click on the Title of your gallery to   work with a particular one.  11.  A number of useful options can be found here. For example, you can update the    Alt & Title Text   Description for all your images at once. Another option is to bulk  edit your images—place a check mark in the ID field for as many images as you want   or click the checkbox in the ID field to select deselect all . Then, click the pull-down  menu that reads No action. A variety of options are available, such as copy, move,  resize, and delete tags. Two of the most useful are Set watermark and Create  new thumbnails.  12. To configure the thumbnail options, visit Gallery  Options  Thumbnails   13.  Watermarking options are configured by visiting Gallery  Options  Watermark.    watermark is a tab at the top—second from the right .  14.  The menu points out that you configure in this screen, and apply in another. It also   points out that this action permanently alters your images.  You can only activate the watermark under Gallery  Manage Gallery.  This action cannot be undone.  71   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  15.  You can use an image or text as a watermark, and adjust the color, opacity,    and positioning.  16.  Check out the general options page at Gallery  Options. 17.  You will need to configure the Slideshow settings if you see an error: The path   to imagerotator.swf is not defined, the slideshow will not work.  18.  You may need to download a script to make the slideshow work. Go here to visit  the homepage of the JW Image Rotator: http:  www.longtailvideo.com  players jw-image-rotator   19.  Then, upload the imagerotator.swf to your server. 20. In the field Path to the Imagerotator  URL , enter the path name. For example,   http:  www.wordpressandflash.com wp-content uploads   21.  You can now configure the slideshow settings such as size, duration, and   transition effects.  22. If you navigate to Appearance  Widgets, you will see three new widgets that you   can drag and drop to your sidebar: NextGen Slideshow, NextGen Widget, and   NextGen Media RSS.  72   When you are editing a post, the insertion of an individual image, a gallery, or a selection of  photos from several galleries  an album  as thumbnails or a slideshow is accomplished simply  by clicking on the Add NextGen Gallery button in the WYSIWYG:  Chapter 3  You can also use shortcode: [slideshow id=1]  Building an image gallery in Flash in  the timeline If ActionScript is not necessarily your strong suit, you can cut down on the amount of coding  you do by utilizing the timeline in Flash's design interface. In this exercise, you will import a  sequence of images and create previous and next navigation buttons.  If you would like to see a preview of the completed gallery, open gallery_timeline.fla  in the Chapter 3 folder.  Getting ready Have more than one image ready to use. Ideally, the images should be named sequentially so  that import is as easy as possible. Also, it is best if the images have the same dimensions so  that the shift between each is not jarring. You may also use the sequential files in the Chapter  3 images folder for this lesson.  How to do it...  1.  Create a new file: File  New. Select Flash File  ActionScript 3.0 . 2.  Rename Layer 1 as images. 3.  Select the key frame on the images layer. Create a movie clip symbol. Insert  New   4.   Symbol  Alt Opt F8  . Select Movie clip, name it mc_slides, and hit OK. In the movie clip, name Layer 1 images Select the first key frame: File  Import  Import to Stage  Ctrl Cmmd R .  73   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  5.  Navigate to and select only the first file in your sequence of files. 6.  Hit Import. You should get the following dialog box. Select Yes. The images   will all be placed into the selected layer, one key frame after another:  7.  Click on Scene 1 at the top left of the stage to access the main timeline. 8.  Select the symbol instance of the movie clip. Name it slides_mc in the Properties   panel. You will call this name later in the ActionScript.  9.  Modify  Page Properties  Ctrl Cmmd J  to adjust the stage size as desired.  Check the box for Match: Contents if you want the stage to exactly match the  size and position of the placed image file. Remember that buttons are going to   be incorporated. If you do not want your buttons to overlap your images, make   the stage large enough to accommodate your buttons. The stage can always be  resized further later.  10.  Position your movie clip containing the images as you like, and save the Flash file. 11.  Make a new layer in the timeline. Name this buttons. Use the Type Tool to   separately type the words Next and Prev. Position these words where you want  them. These are going to become your buttons.  Buttons can be made of almost anything. They can incorporate shapes,  text, movie clips, sound, and more. In addition, you can design your image  gallery to look any way you want it to look. As your own time allows and need  demands, add more layers to hold background and foreground elements to  dress the image gallery up a bit.  12. Select the Prev text. Go to Modify  Convert to Symbol  F8 . For Name,   type b_prev , as is shown in the following screenshot. For Type, select button,  and hit OK:  74   13.  With the symbol selected, name it prev_btn in the Properties panel, like the   example below:  14.  To edit the button so that it has a rollover state and a hit state, double click on it.   This isolates the symbol and shows the timeline for just this one element. By default,  there is an Up state that consists of your text.  15.  Create an Over state by selecting the frame below the word Over and hitting F6.   Change the color of the text.  16.  Create an adequately sized Hit state by selecting the frame below the word Hit and  pressing F6. Make a rectangle that is filled with color and completely overlaps the  text. This provides an active area for your button that your viewer will be able to  reliably hit. No one can see your Hit state. It does not matter what it looks like. The  resulting timeline should look like the following:  17.  Double click on the stage to go back to Scene 1 and exit the timeline for this button. 18.  Select the Next text. Go to Modify  Convert to Symbol  F8 . For Name, type b_next.   Type needs to be button. Click OK.  19.  With the symbol selected, name it next_btn in the Properties panel. 20. Repeat steps 14 – 17 to add Over and Hit states.  Chapter 3  75   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  Now the fun part. It is time to add ActionScript to make this thing run.  1.  Make a new layer at the top of the main timeline, and name it actions. 2.  Select the first key frame of the actions layer: Window  Actions  F9 Option F9 .   Type the following code into the Actions panel: slides_mc.stop  ;  next_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, goForward ; prev_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, goBack ;  function goForward event:MouseEvent :void{     if  slides_mc.currentFrame == slides_mc.totalFrames  {       slides_mc.gotoAndStop 1 ;    } else {    slides_mc.nextFrame  ;    } }  function goBack event:MouseEvent : :void{    if  slides_mc.currentFrame == 1  {       slides_mc.gotoAndStop slides_mc.totalFrames ;    } else {    slides_mc.prevFrame  ;    } }  3.  Save the file. Test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . The image gallery should go forward,   backward, and loop in both directions.  The code for this image gallery allows you to add just about as many images into the timeline  as you need. For the sake of load time, you probably want to keep it under hundred images. All  you have to do is import additional images into additional key frames in the movie clip. Putting  the images into a single movie clip symbol also makes moving and transforming all the slides  at once very easy—simply move or transform slides_mc.  76   Chapter 3  How it works... The ActionScript in the actions layer controls the timeline. The first command the SWF is given  is to stop the timeline of slides_mc on frame 1. From there, the rest of the ActionScript  applies. When you click on a button with your mouse, the ActionScript that applies to a  mouse click on that button is activated. In this case, if someone clicks on the Next button,  the SWF will go to and stop on the next frame in the timeline for slides_mc unless it is  displaying the last frame in that timeline. If it is displaying the last frame, there is not a next  one, so it displays frame 1 instead, just as you told it to do when you wrote in your code. If the  user clicks on the Previous button, the SWF will go to and stop on the previous frame in the  timeline for slides_mc unless it is on the first frame. Since no frame exists before the frame  1, it loops back and displays the last frame just like you told it to do.

This makes updating your image gallery with new images very easy for anyone,  including your clients who may not have any experience with ActionScript. That said, you want  to have a little experience with ActionScript for this one.  If you would like to see a preview of the completed gallery, open gallery_xml.fla in the  Chapter 3 folder.  Getting ready Have images available to you and collected in one folder. JPG files will work well. Is it usually  best if the images have the same dimension. There are images available to you in the  Chapter 3 images folder if you prefer that. You will also need access to a text editor, such as  OpenOffice, to create the XML file.  How to do it...  1.  Create a folder to house your images folder that you have prepped and your   soon-to-be-created .fla, .swf, and .xml files. Move your images folder into this  new folder. Make sure the name of the folder is images.  77   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  2.   In a text editor, create a new file, and save it as gallery1.xml. In the .xml file, type  the following:                  3.  Make sure that you use the name of your image files if they are not named    pic01.jpg, and so on, as in the example.  4.  Save the .xml file to your folder that also contains your images folder. 5.  Create a new file  Flash File ActionScript 3.0  in Flash. 6.  Modify  Document to set the Stage size as needed. 380 x 300 px works well for the   images in the Chapter 3 folder. Remember to leave room for navigation buttons.  7.  Name Layer 1 buttons. Create two buttons: one that will show the next image and   one that will show the previous image. See the Button recipe in Chapter 9 if you need  instructions on how to make a button.  8.  Do make sure that the previous button symbol instance is named prev_btn and the   next button symbol instance is named next_btn. The names should be input into  the Properties panel separately for each button.  9.  Create a new layer at the top of the timeline, name it actions, and select the Key   Frame.  10.  Go to Window  Actions  F9 Option F9  to get the Actions panel. Insert the following   code into the Actions panel for Frame 1 on the actions layer: var total:Number; var pics:XMLList;  var loadersArray:Array=[]; var loadCounter:Number=0; var playCounter:Number=0;  var slideshow:Sprite = new Sprite  ; var picSlides:Sprite = new Sprite  ;  var xml_loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader  ; xml_loader.load new URLRequest "gallery1.xml"  ; xml_loader.addEventListener Event.COMPLETE, processXML ;  function processXML event:Event :void {    var xml:XML=new XML event.target.data ;  78   Chapter 3     pics=xml.image;    total=pics.length  ;    loadImages  ;    xml_loader.removeEventListener Event.COMPLETE, processXML ;    xml_loader=null; }  function loadNext  :void {    var pic:Loader=Loader loadersArray[playCounter] ;    picSlides.addChild pic ;    pic.x =  stage.stageWidth - pic.width  2;    pic.y =  stage.stageHeight - pic.height  2; }  function startShow  :void {    addChild slideshow ;    slideshow.addChild picSlides ;    loadNext  ; }  function onComplete event:Event :void {    loadCounter++;    if  loadCounter==total  {       startShow  ;    }    var loaderInfo:LoaderInfo=LoaderInfo event.target ;    loaderInfo.removeEventListener Event.COMPLETE, onComplete ; }  function loadImages  :void {    for  var i:Number = 0; i < total; i++  {       var url:String=pics[i].@picURL;       var loader:Loader = new Loader  ;       loader.load new URLRequest url  ;       loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener Event.COMPLETE,  onComplete ;       loadersArray.push loader ;    } }  function nextPic event:MouseEvent :void {    playCounter++;    if  playCounter==total  {       playCounter=0;  79   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  function prevPic event:MouseEvent :void {     }     loadNext  ; }     if  playCounter==0 {        playCounter=total-1;     } else {        playCounter--;     }  }        loadNext  ;  next_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, nextPic ;  prev_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, prevPic ;  11.  Test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . The gallery should be working and ready for   all the pieces to go into WordPress.  How it works... The .xml file populates the .swf file with the images listed in it. The images load directly  onto the stage of the .swf. Positioning is controlled by the x and y coordinates. The following  centers the images on the stage:     pic.x =  stage.stageWidth - pic.width  2;    pic.y =  stage.stageHeight - pic.height  2;  The next and previous buttons control which image in the list is being shown. The slideshow  loops based on the conditional statements, such as the following:  function nextPic event:MouseEvent :void {    playCounter++;    if  playCounter==total  {       playCounter=0;    }        loadNext  ; }  function prevPic event:MouseEvent :void {    if  playCounter==0 {       playCounter=total-1;    } else {       playCounter--;  80   Chapter 3     }       loadNext  ; }  Statements that include if and else are very useful when it comes to looping. When next_btn  is clicked, if the image gallery is at the last image, it will display the first image, noted as 0 in  the code. Otherwise  else , it will display the next image listed in the .xml file. The same goes  for prev_btn, except in reverse. If on image 0, it will play the last  total – 1  image.

What if you want to  create a rotating gallery of your WordPress posts or pages? The Featured Content Gallery  allows you to do just this—display an image, post title, and excerpt for each featured article.  A single flash animation provides a navigable slideshow with links to the individual posts or  pages. This is a very useful way to highlight particular or new content. Let's learn how to do it!  Getting ready The Featured Content Gallery homepage is: http:  www.featuredcontentgallery.com   How to do it...  1.  Search for "featured content" under Plugins  Add New. 2.   Install and activate the plugin.  81   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  3.  Use FireBug to identify where you want to insert the Featured Content Gallery  FCG .  In our example, we will use    which has a maximum width of  450px  and place the FCG below  . This will cause the  FCG to appear on the homepage above our posts, below the breadcrumb navigation:  4.  Navigate to Appearance  Editor, and insert the following code to your index.php,   home.php, or as appropriate: <?php include  ABSPATH . ' wp-content plugins featured-content- gallery gallery.php' ; ?>  5.  Click Update File to save your changes. 6.  Next, you will have to edit each post or page you want included in the slideshow. For  the FCG to work, an image must be attached to the post or page by using the custom  field. Your best approach is to resize the images to be used in the FCG to fit the  space. In our example, we will be using a size of 450px X 200px. You can upload the  images via FTP or using the Media Uploader.  7.  You must include the complete URL of the image you intend to use, and the custom   field must be named articleimg.  8.  Edit an existing post or page, and scroll down past your post or page text to the   Custom Field area. In the Name field, enter articleimg. After the first time, you will be able to choose  articleimg from the drop-down menu.  9.   10.  For the value, enter the absolute URL of the image.  82   11.  Our example is: http:  www.wordpressandflash.com wp-content   12. Make sure to click Update Post to save your changes, as you can see in the    uploads fcg1.jpg  following screenshot:  Chapter 3  13.  You must have at least two  2  items featured for the gallery to work, so repeat    14.  Now that your content is ready to work with the FCG, let's configure the    15.

Alternatively, you can specify the IDs of individual posts or pages to be included, as is   shown here:  84   Chapter 3  How to find IDs: To find out the ID, edit the post or page and the URL of your browser that  contains the ID. Look at the end for "post=." For example, the ID below is 23: http:  www.wordpressandflash.com wp-admin post. php?action=edit&post=23 If you want to get the IDs for multiple posts or pages, use FireFox. Make sure  you have a checkmark next to View  Status Bar. Then, go to Posts  Edit:  Hovering over the post title brings up the URL in the Status Bar.  18.  The size of the box that will display your text  title and excerpt  is controlled by    the field named: Text Overlay Height in Pixels.  19.  For instance, if we desire an overlay that is one quarter of the total height,    we would use a setting of 50, since our height is 200px.  20. Click Update Options to save your settings.  85   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  The Multibox plugin conflicts with the FCG—you can only use one or the other.  How it works... The FCG was created from SmoothGallery: http:  smoothgallery.jondesign.net .  Like the Multibox plugin, it uses the MooTools JavaScript framework.  Building a basic slideshow in Flash in  the timeline A slideshow is a series of images that appear one after another. A basic slideshow can be  completed very easily in the timeline in Flash. With additional Flash design skills, you can  further dress up any slideshow to enhance the visual experience of the user. Here, the focus is  on providing the steps to make the slideshow functional. This recipe is for a looping slideshow.  Following this recipe are additional instructions on how to stop the slideshow on the last  image frame.  If you would like a preview of a sample slideshow, open the slideshow_timeline.fla  file in the Chapter 3 folder.  Getting ready Have a sequence of images available to you. JPG files will work well. This will work best if the  images you use are named sequentially  i.e. - pic_01.jpg, pic_02.jpg, pic_03.jpg, and  so on . There are images available to you in the Chapter 3 images folder if you prefer that.  How to do it...  1.  Create a new file: File  New. Select Flash File  ActionScript 3.0 . 2.  Rename Layer 1 to images. 3.  Select the key frame on the images layer. 4.  Go to File  Import  Import to Stage  Ctrl Cmmd R . 5.  Navigate to and select only the first file in the sequence.  86   6.  Hit Import. You should get the following dialog box. Select Yes. The images   will all be placed into the selected layer, one key frame after another:  Chapter 3  7.  Modify  Page Properties  Ctrl Cmmd J  to adjust the stage size as desired. Check   the box for Match: Contents if you want the stage to exactly match the size and  position of the placed image file.  8.  Save the Flash file. 9.  Use Control  Test Movie  Ctrl Cmmd Return  to generate and view the .swf. This   will most likely be a slideshow that is much too fast.  10.  To change the rate of the slideshow, you have a few options:        First off, see if changing the frame rate will make it slow enough. Secondly, you can add more frames more time to each of   your slides.  We suggest a combo.  11.  Go to Modify  Page Properties  Ctrl Cmmd J . Change the Frame Rate, for   instance, to 10 fps  frames per second . Hit OK.  12. Add 10 frames to each key frame on the images layer if you want each slide to show   up for 1 second. Add 20 frames for 2 seconds, and so on.  13.  To add frames, either select each key frame in turn, and hit F5 the desired number   of times, or select the key frames you want to move, and then drag them to the right   in the timeline the desired amount of frames. With the second option, you will need  to add more frames for the last slide by hitting F5 either the desired number of times  or on the appropriate frame. The end result in the timeline should look something   like this:  87   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  14.  Continue to test the movie  Ctrl Cmmd Return , and tweak the frame rate and   number of frames for which the images are visible.  15.  Save the Flash file.  Images can also be converted into symbols and have filters applied to them  and or be animated as part of the slideshow presentation. You can also add a  layer above the images layer to hold a watermark. For animation techniques,  please see Chapter 9: Flash Animations.  How it works... By default, Flash creates looping animations. All you have to do for a basic slideshow is create  a sequence of images in the timeline. From there, add enough time to each image so that the  viewer has enough time to see and enjoy each image. Changing the frame rate is another way  to adjust how long an image is viewable. The lower the frame rate, the longer it takes an SWF  to go from one frame to the next. The faster the frame rate, the more quickly the transition  from one frame to the next occurs. Basically, 10 frames per second is like going 15 miles per  hour. 24 frames per second is like going 60 miles per hour. You can absolutely travel the same  distance and see the same things—one method simply takes less time than the other.  There's more... If you would a slideshow that does not loop, as this one does by default, continue on to the  next steps.  Stopping the loop With any looping slideshow or animation, the following steps apply in order to stop the looping  default function of a SWF:  1.  Have any looping FLA file open in Flash. 2.  Create a new layer at the top of the timeline. Name it actions. 3.   In that layer, select the frame that lines up with the last frame of the   slideshow animation. Insert  Timeline  Blank Key Frame  F7 .  4.  5.  With that new blank key frame selected, go to Window  Actions  F9 Option F9 . 6.   In the resulting Actions panel, type the following: this.stop  ; The code applies to this current timeline. It stops the animation at the frame the  code is applied to. Merely typing stop  ; is also adequate.  88   7.  Save and test  Ctrl Cmmd Return . The SWF should no longer loop. Make sure you   like your last frame.  Chapter 3  Swapping your slides If you want to edit your timeline-based slideshow by changing the images in it, you can!  1.  Open your slideshow file, if not already open. 2.  Go to File  Import  Import to Library. 3.  4.  Select the key frame for the image you want to replace. This should in turn    Import any image file s  you need.  select the image.  5.  Hit the Swap button in the Properties panel:  6.  Select the image you want to use instead. Hit OK. The images are swapped. 7.  Repeat as many times as necessary. 8.  Save and test  Ctrl Cmmd Return .

With XML, you do not have  to open up Flash, import new image files into your FLA, and position them on the stage in the  appropriate key frame. Instead, you can simply update your XML file in any text editor.  89   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  This method of slideshow creation is at the intermediate advanced level because it requires  a fair amount of ActionScript in your Flash document as well as an XML file. In addition to  changing the images that display in the slideshow, the length of time they are displayed can  be changed in the .xml file as well.  If you would like a preview of a sample slideshow, open the slideshow_xml.fla file in the  Chapter 3 folder.  Getting ready Have images available to you and collected in one folder. JPG files will work well. It is usually  best if the images have the same dimension. There are images available to you in the  Chapter 3 images folder if you prefer that. You will also need access to a text editor, such as  OpenOffice, to create the XML file.  How to do it...  1.  Create a folder to house your images folder that you have prepped and your   2.  3.   soon-to-be-created .fla, .swf, and .xml files. Move your images folder into this  new folder. Make sure the name of the folder is images. In a text editor, create a new file, and save it as slideshow1.xml. In the .xml file, type the following:                  4.  Make sure that you use the name of your image files if they are not named    pic01.jpg, etc., as in the example.  5.  Save the .xml file to your folder that also contains your images folder.  6.  Create a new file: File  New. Select Flash File  ActionScript 3.0  7.  Use Modify  Page Properties to set the Stage size as needed.

Save the file as slideshow1.fla. 11.  Test the movie to generate the .swf file  Ctrl Cmd Return .  How it works... The .swf is populated by the images listed in the .xml file in the order in which they are  listed. If you rearrange the order, you rearrange the order of the slideshow. If you change   the images in the .xml list, you change the image that shows up in the .swf. This works  because the ActionScript in the .fla calls the .xml file in this line of the code::  xml_loader.load new URLRequest "slideshow1.xml"  ;  It uses a relative path to do this. So make sure that your .swf and .xml files are located as  stated in your code.  In addition to controlling the order of the images, the .xml file also enables control over how  long each image is visible:     If you change the number, you change the length of time an image shows up. Smaller  numbers cause less time, larger numbers cause more time.  This ActionScript utilizes Sprites so that not even a Movie Clip symbol needs to be created on  the stage. Positioning of the images happens based on the following lines of code that center  it on the stage by dividing the stage dimensions by 2 to find the center:     picSlides.addChild pic ;    pic.x =  stage.stageWidth - pic.width  2;    pic.y =  stage.stageHeight - pic.height  2;  The fade effect is handled through an alpha change with a strong ease applied to it, as  exemplified here:  tweenArray[0]=new Tween pic,"alpha",Strong.easeOut,0,1,3,true ;  There's more... It is always possible to add more to a Flash file. By all means incorporate the information from  the Flash watermarking recipe or your own design skills to continue to add visual elements to  the .fla. Remember to make additional layers to hold the new elements if you are designing  in the timeline.  93   Image Galleries and Slideshows—Using Plugins and Flash  In addition, if you would like to allow viewers to start and stop this slideshow, that is also  possible. It does not even take very many more lines of code. You can check out the demo file  to see this in action. It is the slideshow_xml_buttons.fla file in the Chapter 3 folder.  Below is a still from the slideshow:  Adding navigation  Start and Stop  buttons to the slideshow All you have to do to add the ability to start and stop this slideshow is create a button for  each function. Then, just add a few lines of code.  1.  Use Modify  Document and increase the stage size. Since the code centers the   images on the stage, increase the width and the height. 380 x 300 px works well.  More space is also fine, such as 550 x 400 px.  2.  Create a start button  see Chapter 9: Creating buttons if you need instructions   on how to create a button symbol , and in the Properties panel, name the symbol  instance on the stage start_btn.  3.  Create a stop button, and in the Properties panel, name the symbol instance on   the stage stop_btn.  4.  Add the following lines of code to the end of your ActionScript in Flash:  function stopShow event:MouseEvent :void{    timer.stop  ; }  94   Chapter 3  function restartShow event:MouseEvent :void{    timer.start  ; }  stop_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, stopShow ; play_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, restartShow ;  5.

Luckily, WordPress makes it easy to publish  and share video. In this chapter, we will demonstrate ways of working with video in WordPress  and in Flash. You will learn how to embed an .flv file, create an .xml video sitemap, and  distribute your videos to sites such as YouTube and Blip. We will also show you how to set up  Free WP Tube, a free video blogging theme that allows you to run a video web log  vlog .  Encoding through use of the Flash Media Encoder for reduced file sizes and creation of .flv  is covered along with using Flash's default skinning options and editable Video components.  FLV Embed  Version 1.2.1  If you want to embed .flv files, use a Flash video player, and or publish a video sitemap, this  compact plugin does all three. The homepage is http:  www.channel-ai.com blog  plugins flv-embed .  FLV Embed uses standards compliant, valid XHTML, and JavaScript. It is based on the JW FLV  Media Player, whose homepage is http:  www.longtailvideo.com players jw-flv- player   FLV Embed supports Google video sitemap generation, allowing you to describe, syndicate,  and distribute your video content, facilitating indexing in Google video search.  If a user is missing Flash or has disabled JavaScript, he or she is provided unobtrusive and  appropriate on-screen instructions to correct the problem.  Getting ready When a page with video loads, the player displays either the first frame of the video or a  thumbnail  referred to as a poster image . The poster image is preferable, especially when  a user is choosing between many videos—the first frame of a video may not offer the most  representative or compelling description. Your poster image can be a poster or any image you  like. Here is an example of our finished product:  98   Chapter 4  You will want to think about where you will upload the video files and poster images and,   how you will name them. A good place might be wp-content uploads video.  This plugin requires that you name your poster images the same as your video files. The  default image type is jpg, but you can use any valid image file format. All your images must   be in the same file format.  A batch resize and rename utility is a useful tool. For PC, one free option is the Fast  Stone Image Resizer, which you can download at http:  www.faststone.org  FSResizerDetail.htm.  How to do it...  In your dashboard, navigate to Plugins  Add New. Search for "FLV Embed".  1.  2.  Click Install, then Activate. 3.  Visit the plugin configuration panel at Settings  FLV Embed.  99   Video Blogging + Flash Video Encoding, Skinning, and Components  4.   5.   In the Sitemap menu, check the first box to Enable sitemap feature and automatic  custom field addition. FLV Embed will now be able to create your video sitemap by  automatically adding a custom field each time you use FLV Embed to insert a video. In the Poster menu, check the box to Display poster image for embedded  FLV movies.  6.  For both of the fields, Path to poster directory and Path to FLV directory, we  suggest you leave these blank, and instead use absolute URLs. If you do use   relative  site-specific  URLs, keep in mind that a trailing slash is required. An   example is  wp-content uploads videos . In the Player menu, you may want to change the colors or add your site logo as a  linkable watermark to the video. Review all the Settings, and click Save Changes.  7.   8.  To embed an FLV file, use the following shortcode in HTML view: [flv:url width   height]. For example, you could insert a YouTube video at 480 by 360  using the  absolute URL  like this: [flv:http:  youtube.com watch?v=fLV3MB3DpWN 480 360]  A YouTube video cannot use a poster image because the file name of a jpg  cannot contain a question mark.  9.  You can also insert an FLV that you have uploaded  using the relative path  like this:  [flv:http:  www.wordpressandflash.com wp-content uploads video  swfobject_test.swf 480 360]  10.  Once you have inserted the video, FLV Embed automatically populates the FLV  custom field with two URLs, as you can see below. The first is the location of the  video, and the second is the location of the poster image:  11.  To use a custom poster image, upload any image to wp-content uploads video,  and rename it to match the filename. You can also use an absolute URL if the poster  image file is in another location—the filename must still match.  12. To configure your video XML sitemap, visit the Video Sitemap Options menu by   clicking on Settings  Video Sitemap.  13.  Here, you can get or modify the feed address. Our example is    http:  www.wordpressandflash.com  videofeed.xml.  100   Chapter 4  14.  You can also adjust additional optional settings, and if you have made any changes to  the settings or content and need to rebuild the sitemap or update your custom fields,  you can do that here too.  How it works... The video sitemap is an extension of the XML sitemap we explored in Chapter 2. A video  sitemap allows you to publish and syndicate online video content, including descriptive  metadata to tag your content for Google Video search. Adding details, such as a title and  description, makes it easier for users who are searching to find a given piece of content.   Your poster image will also be included as a clickable thumbnail image. The user will be  directed to your website to see the video.  If FLV Embed cannot automatically generate the XML file, you can simply copy the XML file  from the demo and save it to your server. Make sure to set the file permissions to write  664  or 666  by context-clicking in your FTP client and modifying the File Attributes, as seen below:  Then, make the appropriate changes to the Video sitemap filename field in the Video  Sitemap Options menu, directing the plugin to the XML file you have prepared, and rebuild  the sitemap.  101   Video Blogging + Flash Video Encoding, Skinning, and Components  Here is what your finished feed will look like:  There's more... The videofeed.xml file has a simple structure. The first three tags specify encoding, styling,  and the video sitemap protocol:    <?xml-stylesheet type="text xsl"  href="http:  www.wordpressandflash.com wp-content plugins flv-embed  sitemap.xsl"?> <urlset xmlns="http:  www.sitemaps.org schemas sitemap 0.9"         xmlns:video="http:  www.google.com schemas sitemap-video 1.0">  Next, a   tag wraps each piece of content, which includes a   tag  a link to  the content on your site  and a   tag. The   tag contains additional tags  that specify the video location, the video player location, the poster image location, a title,   and description:      http:  www.wordpressandflash.com flv-embed                  http:  www.wordpressandflash.com wp- content uploads video swfobject_test.swf           http:  www. wordpressandflash.com wp-content plugins flv-embed flvplayer. swf?file= wp-content uploads video swfobject_test.swf< video:player_ loc>          http:  www.wordpressandflash.com wp- content uploads videos swfobject_test.jpg      102   Chapter 4                       <![CDATA[FLV Embed is a great plugin that  allows you to display FLV files &8212; and most other video formats  &8212; in a compact Flash video player.

If you have trouble uploading video, the two most likely causes are the upload limit  set by php.ini or file permissions. If you need to increase the upload_max_filesize of your php.ini, contact  your web hosting provider. If you are using a cpanel environment  such as bluehost,  hostmonster, or hostgator , try the following:  3.  Log in to your cpanel. In the Software Services menu, click on PHP Configuration.   Under Install Default php.ini, click INSTALL PHP.INI MASTER FILE.  4.  This will create a copy of the master php.ini file to your public_html directory  with the name of php.ini.default. Download the file via FTP.  Then, edit the file  name and contents. Search for upload_max_filesize and increase the value.  Save your file as php.ini, and upload it to the directory in which WP is installed.  For how to change file permissions, see Chapter 4, FLV Embed: How it works.

Chapter 4  See also   f FLV Embed  Encoding with the Adobe Media Encoder If you have a video file, such as an MOV or MP4 file that you want to display as a SWF on the  Web, simply encode  or compress  the video file into an FLV. With Flash CS4, you use the  Adobe Media Encoder to do this. It can be accessed directly or through Flash's import video  function. If you are using an earlier version of Flash, encoding is still possible, and the process  is similar.  Getting ready Make sure that you have a video file that is compatible with the Adobe Media Encoder. If you  do not have a file to use, by all means, use the short.mov file in the Chapter 4 folder. This  file is a clip of the full length summer.mp4 file from www.archive.org that is listed on that  website as being in the Public Domain. Use the MOV file because it is a short file, so the time it  takes the encoder to render the video will be shorter. This is good for the purposes of learning  and practicing. Also, do not worry if you cannot hear any of the sounds. There is nothing wrong  with the speakers on your computer. This file does not have audio.  107   Video Blogging + Flash Video Encoding, Skinning, and Components How to do it...  1.  Open the Adobe Media Encoder: 2.  Click the Add button.  3.  Navigate to the file you want to encode, such as short.move, and click Choose OK.  It is now listed in the queue:  4.  Click the down arrow under Format to select into which file format you will encode the   video. Choose FLV  F4V if not already selected.  108   Chapter 4  5.  Click the down arrow under Preset to choose one of the preset export setting options.   The default of FLV - Same As Source  Flash 8 and Higher  is generally fine. If you  have fewer standard video needs, make a different choice based on your needs. Also,  there is an option to Edit Export Settings as well as a Settings button if you want to  make your own decisions. See the Edit Export Settings section for more on that.  6.  Click on the file name under Output File to select the destination of your encoded   file. You can also change the file name.  7.  Click Start Queue, and the encoding process will begin. If you are encoding a long  video, you might want to go take a walk or get a cup of tea. For short.mov, just sit  tight. It should only take a minute or two to encode.  8.  Once encoding is complete, the FLV is saved in the location you chose under the   Output File section. There is also a check mark under the encoder's Status section.  Now, you can do what you want with the file. For instance, you can take it into Flash  and import it into an SWF.  How it works... The Adobe Media Encoder encodes the selected video file into the FLV format. It is similar to  taking a Photoshop file or a TIFF and compressing either of them into a JPG. The process is  simply more involved because the data is more complex.  There's more... The Adobe Media Encoder has many options and capabilities. Among these is a wealth of  export settings that can be edited to suit your needs. Also available to you is the ability to not  only encode multiple files in one sitting but also to duplicate and remove files in your queue.  109   Video Blogging + Flash Video Encoding, Skinning, and Components Edit Export Settings With your file selected in the encoder, click the Settings button. This gives you the Export  Settings dialog box:  As you can see, it has a lot of options. The full purview of working with video for and in Flash   is beyond the scope of this book. Only some of the myriad of options will be discussed below.  At the top left of the dialog box are two buttons: Source and Output. Source shows the video  file you have selected. Output shows a preview of the encoded version of the file.  On the bottom middle left of the Export Settings dialog box, you can address the timeline. You  are able to clip the movie if you want to export only part of it; and you can set up cue points  To clip the movie, do the following:  1.  Drag the playback head back and forth to manually preview the movie. This helps you   find the section you want to keep.  2.  Drag the in and out point triangles back and forth to isolate the section you want to   keep. The triangle on the left is the in point, and the one on the right is the out point.  Everything between the two triangles will be encoded.  110   Chapter 4  The timer keeps track of time in milliseconds.  3.  The right side of the dialog box allows you to change the desired file format; save   your own preset with the button that looks like a computer disk circa 1996. You can  also change the file name of the encoded video and choose if you are exporting only  video, only audio, or both.  The Summary section gives you just that, a summary of your choices thus far.  The bottom right section gives you options for putting on a blur filter under the Filter tab and  changing the format as applicable under the Format tab.  The Video tab lets you choose which Codec to use to encode the video. On2 VP6 is usually  the best choice. Stick with that one. It is more advanced, gives better quality, and allows you  to encode an Alpha Channel if you have one to encode.  Alpha Channels, areas of transparency in video  i.e., green screen ,  cannot be set up in Flash. They must be set up in a video editing program  such as Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro. The encoder can only honor them,  not generate them.  If you need to resize your video, check the box for Resize Video, and change the values as  needed. If you want to constrain the proportions of your video, leave the chain whole.  Frame rate can also be changed here. Generally, it is in your best interest to leave the video  set to the same frame rate it was shot in. Same as source is a good choice. For Bitrate  Settings, the defaults are usually pretty good. If you want higher quality and can take the  additional file size, you can change Encoding Passes to Two.  For Advanced Settings, you can change overall quality by selecting either Quality for Speed,  Good, or Best. It all depends on your needs.  For Audio, if you have it incorporated into your video file, choose Stereo. It sounds better.  The only reason to go with Mono is if you have little sound, if it is a video of a talking head,  or if your file size needs to be as small as possible.  For Bitrate Settings for audio, 128 kb per second is good. Again, only turn this lower if the  audio is overly simple, not important, or your file size dictates it. Faster bitrate higher number  gives you better quality sound.  When you are finished making changes, click OK. This gets you back to the encoder. Proceed  from here as needed.  111   Video Blogging + Flash Video Encoding, Skinning, and Components Encoding multiple files at once This is a piece of cake. If you want to encode more than one file in a row, you absolutely can!  1.  Click the Add button in the Adobe Media Encoder to add another file. In the Open   dialog box, select the file—or Shift Click to select multiple files—and hit Open. Do this  as many times as necessary to get all of the files you want to encode into your queue.  2.  Once the files are in the queue, change the format, preset, and output file name    3.  Click Start Queue. Flash starts at the top of the queue and works its way down one   as needed.  file at a time.  This is also useful if you want to encode the same file with different settings to compare the  quality, etc. For this, select the file that you want to test, and click Duplicate as many times as  you need. Change the Preset, or click Settings as needed for each copy of the file. When you  are ready, click Start Queue.  Removing files  1.  Select one file or more in the queue. 2.  Click Remove.  You will get the following dialog box:  Files can be removed from the queue regardless of their status as either Waiting or complete.  3.  Click Yes. Ta-Dah!

Flash's preset skins consist of a rounded  corner rectangle for a background panel and any of a number of different buttons. The design  for these default skins is the same inside each type; only the kind and number of buttons  changes. There are two types of preset skins: skins that show up over the top of your video  and skins that show up under your video. Choose the one with the buttons you need. There  are options for basics like play pause and mute, as well as more advanced buttons to enable  full screen mode and closed captions. Color can also be affected.  Getting ready Make sure that you have access to an FLV file. If you completed the recipe for encoding with  the Adobe Media Encoder, you can use that FLV. If you need an FLV file, use short.flv  from the Chapter 4 folder.  How to do it...  1.   In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Cmd Ctrl N . Select Flash File   ActionScript 3.0 , and hit OK.  2.  Go to File  Import  Import Video. You should get the following dialog box:  113   Video Blogging + Flash Video Encoding, Skinning, and Components  3.  Click Browse, navigate to the video file of your choice  such as short.flv , and hit   Choose OK.  If you forgot to encode your video file as an FLV before attempting to  import it, click on the Launch Adobe Media Encoder button. This opens  the encoder so that you can remedy your forgetfulness. Once encoding is  complete, just go back into Flash, click OK if you get a warning dialog box,  and browse to your FLV.  4.  Leave Load external video with playback component selected. This is the best   choice if sound is involved in your video and also helps with load time.  5.  Click Continue to get the following options for skinning your FLV:  6.  Choose any skin you want like need.  You can also choose None from the list if you do not want to use a preset skin  but would prefer either none at all or to make your own.  7.  Choose a color for the skin by clicking on the color swatch to access the color picker. 8.  Click Continue, and you get the Summary page.  114   9.  Click Finish, and give Flash a moment to generate everything necessary on the stage.  This is what shows up in Flash:  Chapter 4  10.  Save the file  Cmd Ctrl S , and test the movie  Cmd Ctrl Return  to generate the SWF   and see the file in action.  You now have your FLV, the SWF file of your movie, and a SWF file of your skin. You will need to  bring all of these pieces into WordPress for the movie to play accurately.  How it works... The Adobe Media Encoder encodes the selected video file into the FLV format. The FLV file  format is highly compatible with the Adobe Flash Player and is generally a small file size for  video. Once FLV encoding is complete, the Import Video function of Flash imports the FLV  into Flash and wraps it inside an SWF when you test or publish your Flash movie. If you choose  a skin, Flash also generates an SWF file for the skin. The buttons in the skin are coded and  pretty much ready to go. Some of the more advanced buttons, like the one for full screen  mode, require a little more effort on your part. See the section on Setting up Fullscreen  mode below.  You get all of this functionality without typing a single line of code.  115   Video Blogging + Flash Video Encoding, Skinning, and Components There's more... The different buttons available in the preset skins have different capabilities. Choosing  different buttons allows your viewer to interact with your movie to varying degrees. Some of  the default settings for the movie can be changed using the Component Inspector panel.  Below are a few suggestions for ways to edit the default settings.  Hiding and showing preset skins Just because you chose a skin, it does not mean that you always want it to be visible.  Flash has settings to allow you to hide and show your chosen skin If you want to hide show   your skin, use the following steps:  1.   In Flash, have a file open that has a preset skin. If you do not have a file,   use skinning.fla from the Chapter 4 folder.  2.  Use the Selection Tool to select the FLVPlayback component on the stage. 3.  Go to Window  Component Inspector if it is not already open:  4.  Make sure that Parameters is selected at the top of the panel. This panel allows you  to change settings for the FLVPlayback component skin without messing around with  code. There are a number of things you can change.  5.  To allow the skin to hide when the viewer's mouse is not over the movie and   show when the mouse is over the movie, click on the word false to the right of  skinAutoHide. Change false to true.  6.  Test the movie  Cmd Ctrl Return , and move your cursor over and away from the   movie to see hide and show in action.  116   Chapter 4  Stopping AutoPlay If you want your movie to load in the stopped position, rather than playing as soon as it loads,  do the following:  1.   In Flash, have a file open that has a preset skin. If you do not have a file,   use skinning.fla from the Chapter 4 folder.  2.  Use the Selection Tool to select the FLVPlayback component. 3.  Go to Window  Component Inspector if it is not already open:  4.  Make sure that Parameters is selected at the top of the panel. 5.  Click on the word true to the right of autoPlay. Change true to false. 6.  Test the movie  Cmd Ctrl Return  to check that it does not automatically start   playing. The viewer must hit the play button to get the movie to play.  117   Video Blogging + Flash Video Encoding, Skinning, and Components Setting up Fullscreen mode through Flash By default, fullscreen mode is enabled in the SWF. In order for it to work, however, you need to  add some code to your PHP file in WordPress that will hold the SWF. Follow with us as we go  through the necessary steps:  1.   In Flash, have a file open that has a preset skin with the fullscreen button on it. If you  do not have a file, use skinning.fla from the Chapter 4 folder.  2.  Go to File  Publish Settings:  118   Chapter 4  3.  Select the HTML tab to see the settings. 4.  For Template, select Flash Only - Allow Fullscreen Mode. 5.  Check the box for Detect Flash Version; for Version, set it to at least 9.0.28.   It can also be set to a later version of the Flash player.  6.  Click Publish to generate the HTML page with the necessary code. 7.  Preview this page in your browser by double clicking the HTML file. This is just to   make sure it is working.  According to Adobe, you will need Flash Player version 9.0.28 or later for  the fullscreen mode to work.  8.  View the code for the HTML file. This is easily done by going to View  Page Source  or   something similar  when the file is open in your browser. There should be JavaScript  in the   section and the   section. This needs to be copied and pasted  into your WordPress file that is going to house your SWF.  The code in the   section is quite lengthy, so it is reproduced here only in part. Copy  all of the JavaScript elements in the   of the HTML file to the   of your file in  WordPress. The code begins and ends as follows  the middle is not included due to its length.  Also, there may be some differences in your code depending on settings, etc. :    <!--   v1.7    Flash Player Version Detection    Detect Client Browser type    Copyright 2005-2008 Adobe Systems Incorporated.

There are ways to make this happen. In addition to  the preset skins used in previous recipes, you can also use individual component buttons to  customize your skin.  Getting ready Make sure that you have access to an FLV file. If you completed the recipe for Encoding with  the Adobe Media Encoder, you can use that FLV. If you need an FLV file, use short.flv  from the Chapter 4 folder.  How to do it...  In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Cmd Ctrl N .  1.  2.  Select Flash File  ActionScript 3.0 , and hit OK. 3.  Go to File  Import  Import Video. 4.  Click Browse, navigate to the video file of your choice  such as short.flv , and hit   Choose OK.  5.  Leave Load external video with playback component selected. This is the best   choice if sound is involved in your video and also helps with load time.  6.  Click Continue, to get the options for skinning your FLV. For Skin, choose None. 7.  Click Continue, and you get the summary page. 8.  Click Finish, and give Flash a moment to import the file to the stage.  122   9.   If the Components panel is not already open, go to Window  Components. Click on  the triangle next to Video, as shown in the following screenshot, to get the full list of  preset Video components that you can use and ultimately alter:  Chapter 4  10.  To use any one of the component buttons, simply drag it from the Components panel   onto the stage. Place it where you want it. It can be on top of, below, or beside your  FLV. Unlike with the preset skin, you get to choose the placement.  If you want more control over placement, create a new layer for the  components. Also, you can create a layer below the components and design  a panel for the components to sit on. The panel can be as simple as the  rounded corner rectangle of the preset skins or more complex with opacity  settings and gradation. It is up to you!  11.  As an example, drag the PlayPauseButton onto the stage, and test your movie  Cmd   Ctrl Return . Click the button in the SWF. It toggles between being a pause button  when the movie is playing and a play button when the movie is paused.  12. Go back into Flash and drag out the BackButton. Test the movie  Cmd Ctrl Return .   Click on this button to jump back to the start of the movie.  123   Video Blogging + Flash Video Encoding, Skinning, and Components How it works... These components are pre-coded and ready to go. All you have to do to get the video  components to work is have one FLV on the stage for them to affect. The components  take care of the rest themselves.  There's more... Want more diversity in your design? Check out the next section on editing the look of the  component buttons.  Modifying Video Component buttons for further customization The components can be visually altered to make your FLV player even more individualized  and unique.  Very simply, you can use the Transform Tool to change the size of the component. Just select a  component with the Free Transform Tool, and drag the bounding box to make the component  larger or smaller.  The components are movie clip symbols, so you can use the Properties panel to apply a  Color Effect. Select the component s  you want to change, choose a Style of Color Effect,  and change the settings for that Color Effect. The selected component s  will be affected.  Less simply, you can edit the parts of the component discretely. These are movie clip symbols.  You can double click on the symbol instance on the stage or double click on the icon for the  symbol in the Library to edit the symbol.  Do not delete the symbols that make up the component. This can break the  component. If you do not want part of a component to be visible and if it is a  symbol itself, then lower the opacity of that symbol instance. Do not delete  the symbol instance s  inside the component.  124   To reduce confusion, this section uses one of the components with a simpler design: the  BackButton. Also, to keep things simpler, the symbols that make up the BackButton  component are going to be accessed through the Library panel and referred to by the name  that is applied by default, as we see below:  Chapter 4  1.  The Library should have a folder called FLV Playback Skins. Click on the triangle   next to that folder to open it. It holds all the pieces that make up the different video  components that you placed on the stage.  2.  Open the folder for the Forward and Back Buttons and for the Back Button to   gain access to the pieces of the BackButton component.  125   Video Blogging + Flash Video Encoding, Skinning, and Components  3.  The Back Button folder contains a folder of Assets that are used in the other  movie clip symbols outside the Assets folder.  Start by editing the elements in  the Assets folder.  4.  For instance, double click on the icon next to BackBgOver to change the look of   the background elements of the rollover state, such as the color of the glow.  In the  Timeline, click on the keyframe for the Glow layer to select the outer glow:  In the Properties panel, change the fill color to anything you want.  5.  6.  Test the movie  Cmd Ctrl Return  to see that when you roll over the back button with   your mouse, you get a different color glow border than you did before.  You get the  color you chose.  7.  Double click on the icon beside BackBgDown, and do the same thing to it.  Test the  movie  Cmd Ctrl Return .  Now, when you click and hold your mouse button down on  the button, the glow outline is the color you chose.  8.  Double click on BackIcon to change the look of the double arrows on the button.   Make them larger or smaller with the Transform Tool, or change their color.  Since this  icon inside of the movie clip symbol is just a merged shape, you can delete this and  replace it with something else.    You can even add more layers to any of the movie clips that make up the component.  Just do  not delete any of the movie clip symbols on the stage or in the library!    126   See also   f Encoding with the Adobe Media Encoder  f Using preset skins  Chapter 4  127   5  Working with Audio— Using Plugins and  Flash  In this chapter, we will cover the following:   f Using the WPAudio Player plugin  f Using the µAudio plugin  f Using the PodPress plugin  f Using buttons in the Common Library  f Adding sound effects to a button  f Adding sound effects to the timeline  f Streaming sound and coding a simple on off music button  f Designing your own stylish MP3 player  f Coding your own stylish MP3 player  Introduction In this chapter, we show you how to work with audio in WordPress and in Flash.

Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash  Any SWF file can be imported into WordPress. Just remember that if you are loading external  files into an SWF, those files also need to be uploaded.  WPAudio Player plugin  Version 1.5.2  WPAudio is a plugin for WordPress that embeds a Flash audio player through the use  of shortcode. It is compact and easy to use. Based on a JavaScript sound API called  SoundManager2, it uses JavaScript and Flash. The homepage of SoundManager2 is http:   www.schillmania.com projects soundmanager2 , and the homepage of WPAudio is  http:  wpaudio.com .  How to do it...  "WPAudio."  1.  Download and install the plugin by going to Plugins  Add New, and search for   2.  Click Install and Activate. 3.  Add a new post by clicking Post and Add New. 4.  To upload your audio file, use FTP. Another option is to use the built-in audio browser  uploader. Look for the musical note icon above the Visual Editor, the third button to  the right of Upload Insert, circled in the example below:  5.  Browse to the file on your computer and upload  as shown in the following   screenshot . Once complete, copy the Link URL field to get the address of the file. Do  not click Insert into Post  since doing so will simply insert a link to your .mp3 file, and  our goal is to use the WPAudio player —simply click the "X"  on the top right to close  the window.  130   Chapter 5  131  6.  Now, we can add our shortcode, [wpaudio]. The one required parameter is url.

The finished result looks like this:  Chapter 5  There's more... It is very easy to adjust the CSS styling for µAudio. The first step is to choose the colors you  want and generate the hex triplet values using Photoshop, GIMP, or an online list such as  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Web_coloursX11_color_names.  Connect to your site via FTP, and navigate to the following directory: wp-content plugins  microaudio.  Download the file named microAudio.example.css.  Open up microAudio.example.css in a text editor such as Notepad ++.  Make changes to the style sheet definitions  color and width  as appropriate.  CSS Basics Make sure to preserve the correct CSS syntax: .selector {property: value;} Each selector is either a class, starting with a period  . , an ID, starting with  the pound sign   , or a HTML tag, such as h1  for the   or heading 1 tag   or p  for the   or paragraph tag . A class or ID must be followed  without  any space  by a unique name. The properties must be wrapped in curly braces   {} .  Each property is followed by a colon  : , and each value should end with  a semi-colon  ; .  133   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash  In this example, we change line 19 of microAudio.example.css to change the  background color to fern green:  You can change the width by adjusting the mAp, .adplr class on line 139:  .microAudio-bg {    color: 4F7942;    }  .mAp, .adplr {    width: 300px;    }  PodPress plugin  Version 8.8.1  PodPress is an excellent solution for bloggers who want to share their audio  or video  content  as an RSS feed or podcast. PodPress is both a Flash media player and a content syndication  tool—so, you can easily embed audio in a post or page and distribute it to podcast directories  such as iTunes, Yahoo! Podcasts, Podcast Alley, Podcastready, and blubrry. Other features  include a custom image for videos, a custom image for your feed, and download statistics.  The PodPress homepage is http:  www.mightyseek.com podpress.  PodPress is based upon the 1 Pixel Out Flash media player  same as the µAudio plugin  and  WP-iPodCatter plugin. The homepage of WP-iPodCatter is http:  garrickvanburen.com  wordpress-plugins wpipodcatter.  134   Chapter 5  How to do it...  1.  Download and install the plugin by going to Plugins  Add New.

Using buttons in the Common Library This technical recipe is in preparation for the following music-oriented recipes. It is written for  people who are not very familiar with Flash but still want to be able to accomplish the next few  recipes. Here you will learn how to use pre-made buttons from Flash's Common Library. It is  really very simple.  How to do it...  1.   In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Cmd Ctrl N . Select Flash File   ActionScript 3.0 , and hit OK.  137   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash  2.  Go to Window  Common Libraries  Buttons, and a panel will appear that has a lot  of folders in it. Each folder holds different buttons and the pieces  assets  that make  up those buttons:  3.  Click on one of the triangles to the left of a folder to open the folder. For buttons that  look like play, stop, fast forward, and the like, choose a folder with playback as part  of its name.  4.  Click on the different buttons inside the folder to see what each looks like in the   preview window at the top of the panel. There is a tiny play button in the top right of  the panel that you can click to see the different states  up, over, down  of the button.  They play quickly.  5.  Once you find a button you like, drag it onto the stage where you want it to show up.   You can drag it out by its name in the list or by the image in the preview window.  6.  To resize the button, if you want to, make sure it is selected, and change the width   and height, W: and H:, in the Properties panel.  138   Chapter 5  7.  Save the file  Ctrl Cmd S , and test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . While testing the  movie, roll your mouse over the button to see the over state, and click on the button  to see the down state.  You now have a button that is ready to have ActionScript applied to it!  How it works... Flash offers a number of pre-made elements that are easy to use. The buttons in the Common  Library do not come with code attached. They do, however, come with rollover and down  states ready to go. All you have to do is drag a button out of the Common Library and onto the  stage to use it. It is very similar to creating your own assets and storing them in the Library for  reuse later. In fact, when you drag a button onto the stage from the Common Library, it gets  added into your Library for easy reuse later.  There's more... What if you like a button, but you are not crazy about the look of the over state? Can the  different states of the buttons be edited? You betcha! It is all a matter of double clicking.  Editing a button from the Common Library  1.  Double click on either the symbol instance of your button on the stage or on the   symbol in the Library to isolate the button and access its user-based timeline. The timeline for the button symbol instance should look something like this:  2.  You may have more or fewer layers depending on the complexity of the button you  chose. The important thing is that something appears in at least one layer for each  of the four states: Up, Over, Down, Hit. This ensures that the button is visible at all  times and will function properly with an adequately sized Hit state  the active area of  the button .  3.  To see each of the different states, move the red playback head over each state. No  one ever sees your Hit state. It does not matter what it looks like. It only matters that  it is large enough for a person to hit with a mouse.  139   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash  4.  To edit something, click on it. Either click on the key frame in the timeline or on the   object on the stage.  5.  From here, you can change the scale, color, rotation, and more of any part of the   button. You can delete elements and also draw or import more. It is up to you. Enjoy!  See also   f Designing your own button  f Creating a complex button  Adding sound effects to a button To increase user feedback, you can add sound effects to a button. Sound effects are most  useful when applied to either the Over or Down state. We recommend putting sound effects  only on the Down state so that users hear the sound when they successfully click on the  button rather than every single time they roll over it—on purpose or accidentally. If you are  doing game design or creating applications for children, for instance, your priorities may be  different from ours. The process is the same for placing a sound effect on either state; it is  just a matter of selecting that state in the timeline.  Getting ready Have a Flash file open that has a button symbol on it.  How to do it...  1.  Make sure the sound is turned on for your computer. 2.  Double click on the button symbol instance on the stage or the button symbol    in the library to isolate the button and its timeline.  3.  Click the new layer button at the bottom left of the timeline to create a new layer. 4.  Double click on the name of this layer, and rename it sound effect. 5.  Drag this layer to the top of the timeline. 6.  Click on the frame for the Down state so that it is highlighted:  140   7.  Hit F6 to create a new key frame that will hold the sound effect. 8.  Go to Window  Common Library  Sounds to pull out the menu of default  sounds that come with Flash. You get a panel full of different sound effects   of varying lengths:  Chapter 5  9.  Click on a sound to select it. Then, hit the play button in the top right corner of the  preview window to hear the sound. For the purposes of a button, try a short sound.  You are not limited to the sound files that Flash has available in this library.  You can go to File  Import  Import to Library and choose a compatible  sound file from your own source. You can then use that sound file library item  in the same way as the sound files from the Common Library.  10.  With the key frame for the Down state on the sound effect layer selected, drag the  sound onto the stage. Either drag the item from the list or the wavelength from the  preview window.  141   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash  Nothing will show up on the stage because sound is not visible to the  human eye. However, a wavelength representation will show up in the key  frame in the timeline.  11.  Save the file  Ctrl Cmd S , and test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . While testing the  movie, roll your mouse over the button to see the over state, and click on the button  to see and hear the down state.  How it works... Sound can be added to a key frame just as an image can. The sound effect gets stored in the  Library of the file and accessed played when a user performs the appropriate action. In this  case, a user just needs to click on the button to hear the sound.  There's more... If you need sound when you roll your mouse over the button, you can add sound to the   Over state.  Adding sound to the Over state If you need a sound effect on the Over state instead of, or as well as, on the Down state,  simply follow the directions above with one difference. The key frame goes on the frame for  the Over state rather than the Down state.  Everything else is the same.

Sound effects can go into the main timeline and into the timelines of movie clips  just as they can into the timelines of buttons. In this recipe, you will learn how to put a sound  effect into a time-based timeline.  142   Getting ready Have a file open into which you want to add sound. If you do not have a file to use, open   the bouncing.fla file from the Chapter 5 folder. There is also a bouncing_demo.fla  if you want to see an example of the completed exercise.  Chapter 5  How to do it...  1.  Make sure the sound is turned on for your computer. 2.  Click the new layer button at the bottom left of the timeline to create a new layer  named sound effects above the layer s  with graphics drawn on them and below  the ActionScript layer if you have one.  3.  Create a key frame  F6  on the sound effects layer for every point in time in your   movie that you want a sound to play. If you are using bouncing.fla, create a key  frame when the ball hits the bottom of the stage. If the Sounds library is not already open, go to Window  Common Libraries   Sounds. You can also use your own sound effect by going to File  Import  Import  to Library.  4.   5.  Select a key frame on the sound effect layer that you want to add sound to, and drag  an appropriate sound from the library onto the stage. Repeat this for each of the key  frames you made that should have sound added to them.  6.  Save the file  Ctrl Cmd S , and test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . While testing the   movie, you should hear the sound effect s  you added.  How it works... This timeline in Flash is similar to the user-based button timeline in which the user must do  something  like rollover the button  to activate a response. The difference is that the sound  effect will play when the movie reaches a specific point in the timeline instead of waiting for  the user to perform a specific action. The movie accesses the sound file in the Library and  plays it at the appropriate time.  See also   f Adding sound effects to a button  143   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash Streaming sound and coding a  simple On Off music button For longer elements of sound, like a song, it is a good idea to stream the sound rather than  embed it into the Flash movie. This helps to keep your file size and load time down. It also  gives you more control over starting and stopping the sound. So, if you want to include a song  or a longer element of music sound in your SWF, stream the sound.  Also, if you are planning to have music lengthy sound files as part of your blog, it is polite and  savvy to give viewers the option of turning the sound off. They may prefer their own music as a  soundtrack to your blog. They may also be viewing your blog in a professional or other setting  where sound is not appropriate.  Getting ready Make sure that you have sound files  MP3 and WAV files are great  saved in the same location  in which you are going to save your SWF file. There is a sound file in the Chapter 5 folder.  You can also download songs, loops, and sound effects from a number of different websites  such as www.flashkit.com and www.creativecommons.org.  How to do it...  1.   In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Cmd Ctrl N . Select Flash File   ActionScript 3.0 , and hit OK.  2.  Go to Insert  New Symbol. Name the symbol mc_stopPlay. Choose Movie Clip,   and click OK.  3.  Double click on the symbol in the Library to isolate it and view its timeline. 4.  Rename the layer buttons. 5.  On the first key frame of the buttons layer, place or create a stop button. Go to   Window  Common Libraries  Buttons to find pre-made buttons if you need. In the  Properties panel, name this symbol instance stop_btn.  6.  Select the second frame in the buttons layer, and create a new blank key frame  F7 . 7.  On the second key frame of the buttons layer, place or create a play button. In the   Properties panel, name this symbol instance play_btn.  8.  Create a new layer by clicking the new layer button at the bottom left of the timeline.   Name this layer actions.  9.  Select the first key frame of the actions layer, and go to Window  Actions.  144   10.  Put the following code into the Actions panel with the name of your sound file in   Chapter 5  place of song.mp3: this.stop  ;  audio.play  ;  var audio:Sound = new Sound new URLRequest "song.mp3"  ;  stop_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, stopAudio ;  function stopAudio event:MouseEvent :void { flash.media.SoundMixer.stopAll  ; gotoAndStop 2 ; }  11.  Select the second frame of the actions layer, and create a new blank key frame  F7 . 12. In the Actions panel, type the following code:  play_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, playAudio ;  function playAudio event:MouseEvent :void {    gotoAndStop 1 ; }  13.  Save the file  Ctrl Cmd S , and test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . While testing the  movie, you should hear the sound file you named in your code. If you do not, make  sure that you have no typos and that the path you used is correct. For instance, if the  sound file is in a folder called songs, you would type "songs mysong.mp3" instead  of just the file name alone.  How it works... The file is coded so that the sound file should exist externally.  Inside the movie clip on frame 1, the code first tells the Flash player to stop right away inside  of this timeline: this.stop  ;  Then, there is a line of code that sets up the variable and class that allow the sound to  stream play while also naming and pointing to the sound file to be used.   audio.play  ; makes the sound file play right away. No button pressing is necessary to  make the sound stream initially.  145   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash  The rest of the code exists to make the stop_btn do its job. It, basically, translates into the  following: "When stop_btn is clicked, stop all sounds and go to and stop on frame 2 of this  timeline." Going to and stopping on frame 2 allows you to see the other button and utilize the  ActionScript that allows you to stream play the sound file again.  Frame 2's code is a little less involved. All it has to do is make the play_btn send you back  to frame 1 where all the coding is already written to get the music to play.

Everyone's sense  of style is different. The overall goal with this is to keep it unobtrusive and sleek while still  looking cool. Depending on the amount of time and your skill level, you can absolutely make  a simpler version or something much more involved. There are people who spend their entire  corporate workday creating gradients on top of gradients next to gradients to make buttons  and player applications of all kinds look as shiny, sleek, and realistic as possible. Here, you  will learn a little trick and use just two gradients. This design also incorporates a dynamic text  field that is optional. The design dimensions can be changed to eliminate the text field if it is  unnecessary. The basic design is shown below. The text field, if you choose to incorporate it,  will be centered inside the player.  How to do it...  1.   In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Ctrl Cmd N . Select Flash  File  ActionScript 3.0 , and hit OK.  146   2.  Go to Modify  Document  Ctrl Cmd J , and change the Dimensions to   350 px x 120 px. Change the Background color to black, like the following example:  Chapter 5  3.  Rename layer 1 to base panel. 4.  Use the Rectangle Primitive tool to create a rectangle that is 318 x 90 px. 5.   In the Properties panel, under Rectangle Options, round the corners as much as  possible. The demo is approximately 39 for each corner.  6.  Center align the shape to the stage. Go to Window > Align. Click the To Stage button.   7.   Click the buttons to center align vertically and horizontally. In the Color panel, apply no stroke and a black and white radial gradient for the fill.  Then, adjust the gradient so that the white color stop is light grey. Click on the white  color stop, and input 8C8C8C in the hexadecimal code text field. Use the Gradient  Transform tool to alter the gradient like so:  147   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash  8.  With the shape still selected, go to Edit  Copy  Ctrl Cmd C . 9.  Now, lock this layer. 10.  Make a new layer in the timeline by clicking on the new layer button at the bottom left   of the panel. Name this layer top panel.  11.  Go to Edit  Paste in Place to make an exact copy of the panel in the exact same   location.  FFFFFF.  12. In the color panel, change the light grey color stop on the gradient bar to white:   13.  With the shape still selected, convert it into a symbol so that a blending mode can be   applied. Modify  Convert to Symbol  F8 .  14.  Name it mc_sheen, and for Type choose Movie clip. Hit OK.. 15.  In the Properties panel, under Display, change Blending to Multiply.  At any point, you can double click on the symbol instance and adjust  the position and or color the gradient to better suit your style needs.  16.  Lock this layer. 17.  Create a new layer called text box, and position it between base panel and top panel   in the timeline layer hierarchy.  18.  Grab the Type tool, and create a text box that is 160 x 56 px. In the Properties panel,  under Character, change the font to Bauhaus. If you do not have that font, choose a  different font. Set the Size to 14.0 pt and the Color to white FFFFFF. At the top of  the panel, name this songDetails, and change it to Dynamic Text, as we see in the  example below:  148   Chapter 5  19.  Also, under Paragraph, make sure that Behavior is multi-line. Center align your text. 20. Type a few lines into the text field to see the effect of the top panel on the type. Save   the file first, and then test it  Ctrl Cmd Return .  21.  Lock this layer for now. 22. Create a new layer at the top of the timeline, and name it buttons. 23. Use Flash's type and drawing tools on this layer to create elements that will be   converted into buttons. A boomerang shape created by clicking at desired corner  points was created for the previous and next buttons. The play and pause buttons are  text with these settings:  Bauhaus      White FFFFFF        12 pts Letter Spacing: 1.0.  24.  The previous and pause buttons are positioned on the left side of the player. The next   and play buttons are positioned on the right side of the player. This is to make the  player look symmetrical. All the buttons are centered vertically to the stage.  25. Select the previous button, and go to Modify  Convert to Symbol  F8 . Name it  b_prev, and for Type choose Button. Hit OK. In the Properties panel, name the  instance prev_btn. Double click on the instance. For a bare minimum, give this a  Hit state. Select the frame for Hit, and press F6 to create a new key frame. Create a  rectangle that is slightly larger than the graphic. If you want Over and or Down states,  create key frames for those states, and alter the graphic or add another element to it.  The demo is minimal.  26. Select the next button, and go to Modify  Convert to Symbol  F8 . Name it b_next,   and for Type choose Button. Hit OK. In the Properties panel, name the instance  next_btn. Double click on the instance. Make this button's states match the look  and sizing of b_previous. All buttons should have the same look for each state—and a  good-sized Hit state.  27.  Select the pause button, and go to Modify  Convert to Symbol  F8 . Name it   b_pause, and for Type choose Button. Hit OK. In the Properties panel, name the  instance pause_btn. Double click on the instance. Make this button's states match  the look and sizing of b_previous. All buttons should have the same look for each  state—and good-sized Hit state.  28. Select the play button, and go to Modify  Convert to Symbol  F8 . Name it b_play,   and for Type choose Button. Hit OK. In the Properties panel, name the instance  play_btn. Double click on the instance. Make this button's states match the look  and sizing of b_previous. All buttons should have the same look for each state—and  good-sized Hit state.  149   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash  29. Select each button in turn, and adjust the transparency of each to different settings  so that the shading change seems to affect them also. Go to the Properties panel:  Color Effects: Style: Alpha to do this. The demo uses the following settings:              prev_btn: 24% pause_btn: 34% play_btn: 54% next_btn: 38%  30. Unlock the text box layer, and line it up vertically as best you can so that the baseline   of the middle line of text lines up with the baseline for the play and pause buttons.  You can go to View  Rulers and drag a guide down from inside the top ruler to help  you in your efforts.  31.  Save!  How it works... Flash has a fair number of drawing tools to help you in your efforts as a designer of cool  Flash apps and animations. Applying gradients over the top of one another and changing the  blending modes and or transparency settings on the top elements helps to make your design  look more complex and dimensional. In order to apply a blending mode or transparency  setting, you must have an element of text, a movie clip, or a button. Transparency and  blending modes apply to the element they are placed on and allow the look of that element to  be affected by the color and tints shades of the elements below it. The elements on top will  not be affected by the transparency and blending mode changes.  This means that the blending mode change on the top panel layer only affects the text  box and the base panel layers. The buttons layer must be above the top panel layer in the  timeline so that you can still click on the buttons! To compensate for the loss of the gradient's  effect, you change the transparency of each button to a different setting to give the illusion of  its being affected by the shade shift.

The  player has buttons to go to the next song, the previous song, pause a song, and continue  playing a song. Now, you need code. This is the recipe for that code.  Getting ready Have a Flash file that has previous, next, pause, and play buttons. Name them as follows so  that you can directly copy the code in this recipe:   f previous: prev_btn  f next: next_btn  f play: play_btn  f pause: pause_btn  If you do not have a file prepped, use the player.fla file in the Chapter 5 folder. Delete  the dynamic text field if you are not planning on using it. Coding for the dynamic text field  is not covered in the body of this recipe but in the There's more section of Displaying song  information on your MP3 player.  Also, have more than one sound music file available to you and saved in the same folder  location that you are saving the FLA and SWF for this recipe.  If you want to see the demo working, take a look at player_coded.fla in the  Chapter 5 folder.  How to do it...  1.  Make sure that the buttons in your design really are named as follows:              previous: prev_btn next: next_btn play: play_btn pause: pause_btn  2.  Make a new layer at the top of the timeline by clicking the new layer button at the   bottom left of the timeline, and name it actions.  3.  Go to Window  Actions, and put the following code into the text area  change the   names of the MP3 files to match your file names : var playList:Array = new Array "song.mp3", "song1.mp3", "song2. mp3", "song3.mp3" ; var nowPlaying:Boolean = false;  151   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash  var currentSong:Number = 0; var song:Sound; var channel:SoundChannel = new SoundChannel  ; var position:int;  loadSong playList[currentSong] ;  function playSong position:Number :void {    if  !nowPlaying  {       nowPlaying = true;       channel = song.play position ;       channel.addEventListener Event.SOUND_COMPLETE, songEnded ;    } }  function pauseSong  :void {    position=channel.position;    channel.stop  ;    nowPlaying = false; }  function nextSong  :void {    if  currentSong < playList.length - 1  {       currentSong++;       pauseSong  ;       loadSong playList[currentSong] ;    }  }  function prevSong  :void {    if  currentSong > 0  {       currentSong--;       pauseSong  ;       loadSong playList[currentSong] ;    }  }  function playNow event:MouseEvent :void {    playSong channel.position ; }  function pauseHere event:MouseEvent :void {    pauseSong  ; }  function goForward event:MouseEvent :void {  152   Chapter 5     nextSong  ; }  function goBack event:MouseEvent :void {    prevSong  ; }  function loadSong thisSong:String :void {    song = new Sound  ;    song.load new URLRequest thisSong  ;    playSong 0 ; }  function songEnded event:Event :void {    pauseSong  ;    nextSong  ; } play_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, playNow ; pause_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, pauseHere ; next_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, goForward ; prev_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, goBack ;  4.  Save and test  Ctrl Cmd Return . Presto!  How it works... The code is set up to work with buttons that exist in your Flash document with the names  specified in the code. Those names can always be changed as you need. Just make sure the  name of the button instance matches what it is called in the code.  First off, variables, classes, and an array are set up. The array is the list of the song file names  that are to be played in the order they are to be played. These file names need to match the  names of your song files. The other variables classes are there so that the sound files will  stream and the play and pause buttons will work appropriately—pausing the song halfway  through and resuming at the same position in the song.  Then, we have a list of functions that work together to move to the next song  and pause stop  the current song so only one is heard at a time , move to the previous song, pause the song,  and play the song from the paused position. There are also functions regarding loading a song  from the array and what to do when a song has ended.  At the end, there is the list of click events that the Flash player is listening for that will initiate  the different functions of the code.  As long as there are no typos and the sound files are in the same folder as the SWF, the player  should work just fine.  153   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash There's more... If you would also like to display information about the song, continue to the following section.  It adds a few lines to the code in the body of this recipe and is designed for use with a  dynamic text field named songDetails and the id3 information that is embedded in many   possibly most  MP3 files. Id3 information is metadata and includes items such as track and  artist names. So, rather than taking the time to type all of this out yourself and code a whole  second array, just use the information that is already embedded in the MP3.  The settings you used for the Character and Paragraph settings in the Properties panel in  Flash for the dynamic text box will apply to the id3 information that is displayed in the text box.  To see a demo, take a look at player_song_details.fla in the Chapter 5 folder.  Displaying song information on your MP3 player  1.  Make sure that your Flash file has a dynamic text field named songDetails. 2.  Add the following code to the code from the body of this recipe section:  function displayID3 event:Event :void {    songDetails.text = " '" + song.id3.songName + "' by " + song. id3.artist; }  3.  To change the text that appears inside the dynamic text field with your id3   information, alter the text that is inside the double quotes that are shown above.   For instance, make the dynamic text field read the following:  'Song Title' performed by Artist Name.  4.  To accomplish this, change "' by " in the code to "'performed by " and, add the   following line into the loadSong function:    song.addEventListener Event.ID3, displayID3 ;  The completed code for this entire recipe section should look like this  with your own sound  file names in place of the examples given :  var playList:Array = new Array "song.mp3", "song1.mp3", "song2.mp3",  "song3.mp3" ; var nowPlaying:Boolean = false; var currentSong:Number = 0; var song:Sound; var channel:SoundChannel = new SoundChannel  ; var position:int;  loadSong playList[currentSong] ;  function playSong position:Number :void {    if  !nowPlaying  {       nowPlaying = true;  154         channel = song.play position ;       channel.addEventListener Event.SOUND_COMPLETE, songEnded ;    } }  Chapter 5  function pauseSong  :void {    position=channel.position;    channel.stop  ;    nowPlaying = false; }  function nextSong  :void {    if  currentSong < playList.length - 1  {       currentSong++;       pauseSong  ;       loadSong playList[currentSong] ;    }  }  function prevSong  :void {    if  currentSong > 0  {       currentSong--;       pauseSong  ;       loadSong playList[currentSong] ;    }  }  function playNow event:MouseEvent :void {    playSong channel.position ; }  function pauseHere event:MouseEvent :void {    pauseSong  ; }  function goForward event:MouseEvent :void {    nextSong  ; }  function goBack event:MouseEvent :void {    prevSong  ; }  function displayID3 event:Event :void {    songDetails.text = " '" + song.id3.songName + "' by " + song.id3. artist; }  function loadSong thisSong:String :void {    song = new Sound  ;  155   Working with Audio—Using Plugins and Flash     song.load new URLRequest thisSong  ;    song.addEventListener Event.ID3, displayID3 ;    playSong 0 ; }  function songEnded event:Event :void {    pauseSong  ;    nextSong  ; }  play_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, playNow ; pause_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, pauseHere ; next_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, goForward ; prev_btn.addEventListener MouseEvent.CLICK, goBack ;  According to the ActionScript 3.0 Language and Components Reference, there  are a number of properties in ActionScript for utilizing id3 information. They  are album, artist, comment, genre, songName, track, and year. You  only use songName and artist in this recipe.

Flash Applications WP-Cumulus  Version 1.22  We will look at the working of WordPress Cumulus plugin under this recipe.  Getting ready Tagging your content is easy and advisable. WordPress tags have at least two functions.  First, they are a flexible navigational tool, allowing users to see similar posts from a variety of  categories. Second, tags are a SEO tool to increase your keyword density. Tags, in their most  simple form, are a list of links displayed for individual posts. The tag cloud is a more complex  visual representation that outputs all your tags, with larger font sizes to denote tags that are  used most frequently. WP-Cumulus is a plugin that creates a 3D rotating tag cloud as a Flash  animation. Flash and HTML are used, so you get both visual appeal and SEO utility.  WP-Cumulus is authored by Roy Tanck. The plugin homepage is: http:  www.wordpress. org extend plugins wp-cumulus   WP-Cumulus requires WordPress version 2.3 or newer.  How to do it...  "WP-Cumulus."  1.

It contains a   dynamic text field and a movie clip that is the same size as the stage.   f tagcloud.swf – This is the compressed movie.  f tagcloud.xml – This is the XML file that holds the list of all of the tags to be   displayed in the tag cloud.  To change how the tags in the cloud look  or the tag cloud in general , open the TagCloud. as file and adjust the ActionScript as desired. For instance, if you want to change the basic  color of the tags, change the hexadecimal numbers in the following lines of code:     tcolor =   this.loaderInfo.parameters.tcolor == null   ? 0x333333   : Number this.loaderInfo.parameters.tcolor ;           tcolor2 =   this.loaderInfo.parameters.tcolor2 == null   ? 0x995500  : Number this.loaderInfo.parameters.tcolor2 ;     hicolor =   this.loaderInfo.parameters.hicolor == null   ? 0x000000  : Number this.loaderInfo.parameters.hicolor ;   f tcolor is the basic text color when the normal-sized tag is farther back  333333   f tcolor2 is the color of the normal sized tag when it is in the front  995500   f hicolor is the highlight color for normal sized tags  000000   When the tags are larger  due to popularity , then the color change is determined by these  lines of code:     private function getColorFromGradient  perc:Number  :Number {          var r:Number =   perc *   tcolor >> 16     +    1-perc  *    tcolor2 >> 16    ;              var g:Number =   perc *    tcolor >> 8  % 256     +    1-perc  *     tcolor2 >> 8  % 256    ;  160   Chapter 6     var b:Number =   perc *   tcolor % 256     +    1-perc  *   tcolor2  % 256    ;     return   r << 16    g << 8   b  ;  The color numbers here are based on RGB values from 0 to 256. The color is being applied  based on the percent  perc  determined earlier in the code.  To adjust the setting for the tags, rather than for the entire cloud, make changes to the   Tag.as file. Here, you find code elements for font, mouse events, and more.  There are many more facets of the code that can be altered. Above is a baseline example.  Also, inside the ActionScript files, Roy Tanck does a great job of adding comments to his code  to explain the purposes of different sections.  In addition to changing the ActionScript files, you can also add and delete information from  the XML file as well. For example, you can change links and add tags.

Create an XML file using the text editor of your choice. 2.   Input the following code:           There's a special joy that comes with tweening.       See?  You, too, can create SWFs from scratch.       Randomness is good for the soul.        If you code it, they will come.       Movie clips and text fields and code - Oh my!       Ancient proverb: To code a site is to truly know a  site.       Speaking of randomness, how do you feel about ducks?         Math is fun.  So is Flash.  Put them together and what  do you get?  Well, this.      In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Cmd Ctrl N .  3.  Type anything you want inside the     tags. 4.  Save the file as quotes.xml. 5.  6.  Select Flash File  ActionScript 3.0  and hit OK. 7.  Go to File  Save As and save this file as quote_rotator.fla. 8.  Set the stage size and background color to whatever is appropriate for your   design and quote length. The demo is 003333, 800px wide and 50px tall.  Go to Modify  Document  Ctrl Cmd J  to do this.  9.  Double click on the layer in the timeline and rename it text. 10.  Use the Type tool to create a text field that is the size you need for your design.    The demo is 750px x 20px.  168   Chapter 6  11.  In the Properties panel, name the text block text_txt and give it attributes   such as a font and font size. The demo is set to Lithos Pro, Regular, 14pt.  The text color is CCCCCC. Click the Embed button to embed the font.  12. Select the text block with the Selection tool and go to Modify  Convert to Symbol    F8 . Name the symbol mc_quote and choose Movie Clip for Type. Hit OK.  13.  In the Properties panel, name this movie clip quote_mc. 14.  Use the Align or Properties panel to position the movie clip as necessary. In the   demo, the movie clip is centered vertically and horizontally.  15.  Create a new layer in the timeline by clicking on the new layer button at the bottom    left of the panel. Double click on the layer name to rename this layer actions.  16.  Go to Window  Actions  F9 Option F9  to pull out the Actions panel. 17.  Put the following code into the panel:  import fl.transitions.*; import fl.transitions.easing.*;  var quotes:Array = new Array  ; var randomNumber:Number; var textTween:Tween;  var rotateTimer:Timer = new Timer 7000 ; rotateTimer.addEventListener "timer",", nextQuote ; rotateTimer.start  ;  var xml:XML; var xmlPath:String = "quotes.xml"; var loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader  ; var myXML:URLRequest = new URLRequest xmlPath ; loader.addEventListener Event.COMPLETE, loadComplete ; loader.load myXML ;  function loadQuotes  :void{    for each var item:XML in xml.quote {       quotes.push item ;    } }  function randomness  :void{    randomNumber = Math.round Math.random   *  quotes.length - 1  ;    quote_mc.quote_txt.text = quotes[randomNumber];    TransitionManager.start quote_mc, {type:Wipe,  direction:Transition.IN, duration:3, easing:Regular.easeOut,  startPoint:1} ; }  169   Flash Applications  function loadComplete event:Event :void{    xml = new XML event.target.data ;    loadQuotes  ;    randomness  ; }  function nextQuote event:TimerEvent :void{    randomness  ; }  18.  Save the file and test it  Ctrl Cmd Return .  How it works... The quotes are pulled from the   tags in the XML document and populate the SWF  file. This is done via ActionScript.  The XML file is denoted in the line:  var xmlPath:String = "quotes.xml";  This path can be changed as needed to point to the location of the XML file you are using.  Making the quotes appear in a random order is primarily handled in the randomness  function. The quote shown is figured through a little bit of Math.  The amount of times a quote shows up is controlled by the number in this line of code:  var rotateTimer:Timer = new Timer 7000 ;  The number is a value in milliseconds. The demo has a quote showing up for seven seconds  including the time it takes for the wipe in effect.  The wipe in effect is primarily dealt with in this line of code:     TransitionManager.start quote_mc, {type:Wipe, direction:Transition. IN, duration:3, easing:Regular.easeOut, startPoint:1} ;  The visibility change  Wipe, TransitionIN  is applied to the movie clip named quote_mc.  The type of ease used in the demo is Regular.easeOut. This means the animation change  starts fast and then slows down. This visibility change starts at 1  representing the top left  corner  and proceeds through to wipe in the entire movie clip at end point 9  representing the  bottom right corner of the movie clip . The numbers 1-9 can be visualized as the bounding  box points when you select your movie clip with the Free Transform tool. Feel free to test a  different startPoint.  170   Chapter 6  There's more... There's more than one way to tween a symbol.  Additional transitions exist. These are Blinds, Fade, Fly, Iris, Photo, PixelDissolve,  Rotate, Squeeze, Wipe, and Zoom. The transitions have the same properties with the  exception of the last, which is specific to the transition chosen. Fade requires an alpha  change, whereas Wipe requires a startPoint.  There are other easing options available per Adobe. Classes in addition to Regular are Back,  Bounce, Elastic, None, and Strong. For the purposes of legibility, Regular and Strong  are your best bets.  To further modify the ease, there are three methods: easeOut, easeIn, easeInOut. easeOut starts the tween fast and ends it slow; and easeIn does the opposite. To get both a  slow start and end, use easeInOut, just make sure that you have enough time in your timer  for it to render well.  Fading the text in your Rotator In your Flash file, access your ActionScript in the Actions panel  F9 Option F9 .  Change this line of code:  to this line of code:     TransitionManager.start quote_mc, {type:Wipe, direction:Transition. IN, duration:3, easing:Regular.easeOut, startPoint:1} ;     TransitionManager.start quote_mc, {type:Fade, direction:Transition. IN, duration:3, easing:Regular.easeOut, alpha:0} ;  If you prefer to have the text start out 100% opaque and then fade out, try this line of code  instead:     TransitionManager.start quote_mc, {type:Fade, direction:Transition. OUT, duration:7, easing:Regular.easeIn, alpha:0} ;  This is a simple fade out effect that should be set to the same amount of time as the duration  of each quote. If your timer is set to 7,000 milliseconds, then set your duration for the fade  out effect to 7 seconds.  171   Flash Applications See also   f Flexi Quote Rotator plugin 0.1  WP sIFR  Version 0.6.8.1  The following section talks about the WP sIFR plugin.  Getting ready... You are probably aware that web pages use a limited set of fonts. Your word processing  program allows you to choose from a wide variety of fonts—as many as are installed on your  computer. So why can't you use these fonts on your web page? Since a web page needs to  be available to users with many different system configurations, there is no way to be sure  which fonts they have installed. The solution has been to use a set of web only fonts that are  standard on all systems.  New solutions are in place today to deliver rich typography on the Web, including fonts outside  of the standard web-only font families. In this section, we'll explore sIFR, or Scalable Inman  Flash Replacement. This new technology uses Flash to recreate and replace text you've  tagged to be "sIFRed." WP sIFR allows you to use custom fonts on your WP blog. WP sIFR  version 0.6.8.1 is authored by Jake Snyder. The plugin homepage is: http:  labs.jcow. com plugins wp-sifr   How to do it...  1.  Download and install the plugin by going to Plugins  Add New and search for "sIFR." 2.  Click Install and Activate. 3.  The first step is to convert a True Type Font  .ttf  into a sIFR .swf file by using the  sIFR generator, available here: http:  www.sifrgenerator.com wizard.html  4.  Browse to your Fonts folder to locate the address of a font to use, such as:   C:\WINDOWS\Fonts\BickhamScriptPro-Bold.otf  5.  You can convert an .otf file to a .ttf file by following the Online Font Converter   link in the sidebar: http:  www.onlinefontconverter.com   172   6.  Copy and paste the address from the .ttf file into the TrueType Font field and   click Next:  Chapter 6  7.  Choose the sIFR version to use and click Next. You must use the most up to date   version—sIFR 3 r436:  8.  Choose which characters you need, based on your intended use, and click Next.   We choose Letters, digits and common other characters:  173   Flash Applications  9.  Enter the verification word. 10.  Review your choices and click Next:  11.  Download the .swf file:  12. Remove any spaces from the file name and upload the .swf file to a folder   named fonts within your theme directory, such as:  wp-content themes  default fonts  The plugin looks in two places for font files: a  fonts folder in your active  theme, or wp-content plugins wp-sifr fonts. If you use the  plugin folder instead of the theme folder, your fonts will be deleted when  using the WordPress automatic upgrade option for plugins. For this reason,  using the theme folder is recommended.  13.  Visit the plugin configuration page by clicking on Settings  WP sIFR. 14.  Check the Activate this font checkbox to activate the new font:  174   15.  The Item to Replace  Selector  menu is where you specify which tags to replace.   To use more than one selector, simply use commas. Our example is h1.  16.  Click on Settings to set CSS styling. Our example is:  .sIFR-root { font-size:64px; font-weight:normal; color:666666;   text-align: center; width: 708px;} a { text-decoration:none; color:ffffff; } a:hover { color:ad1010; }  Please note that the font-weight property must match your font—bold  is only a valid value if you have uploaded the bold version of the font. sIFR  will not display unless the font you've uploaded and the font-weight  property match.  17.  Click on Advanced Settings to edit additional Flash variables. The following  sets the background color of the Flash animation—either one or the other is   required to display correctly in Internet Explorer: wmode: 'transparent'  or wmode: 'opaque'.  18.  Click Save Changes.  Chapter 6  175   Flash Applications How it works... sIFR utilizes JavaScript, CSS, and Flash to deliver rich typography to your users. Your page  loads normally by using HTML or XHTML. Then, JavaScript verifies that Flash is installed and  looks for text you've tagged to be replaced. If Flash is not installed or if JavaScript is blocked,  the normal page is delivered. Otherwise, the script creates Flash objects that output your text  in a new font and replace the elements you've tagged with these animations.  There's more...

Among other things, the documentation explains the  implementation and editing of the discrete parts of the plugin. To see the information  pertaining specifically to Flash, click on Flash Configuration or Filters. Flash Configuration  shows you the options to change for the flash Options.as file. The Filters page lists the  different types of filters and the properties that belong to them. You can edit the filters by  simply changing the hexadecimal code for the color of something  e.g. - change 000000 to  CCCCCC  or even add another filter such as a Bevel. Just make sure that you follow the same  format shown on http:  wiki.novemberborn.net sifr3 Filters to ensure that the  code will work:  filters: {   DropShadow: {     knockout: true     ,distance: 1     ,color: '330000'     ,strength: 2 }  Please note that the Flash coding language used for this  plugin is ActionScript 2.0.

This recipe tells you how  to do that. The steps are modified from the very effective tutorial at http:  code.google. com apis maps documentation flash intro.html. This recipe is honed down to the  essential steps for working specifically with Flash CS4 and Google Maps API library. A perk of  incorporating a Google map in this fashion, rather than just using a static bitmap image of a  map, is that as Google updates their map library, you get to reap the benefits of those updates.  Getting ready You must have a URL that belongs to you in order to get an API key from Google to use their  Google Maps API library.  Go to http:  code.google.com apis maps signup.html to sign up for the Google  Maps API. It is not possible to incorporate an interactive Google map into a SWF web page  without doing this first. There is a list of requirements as well as terms and conditions that  you must agree to and abide by in order to use this. By signing up, you will receive an API key  that will be used referenced in your ActionScript. Each domain name that you want to use a  Google Map in will need to have its own API key as the key is specific to your URL. The key will  be a long line of numbers and letters.  Have the latitude and longitude of the location you want centered in your map. There are  many websites that can provide latitude and longitude. You can use a search engine of your  choice to search for such sites.  179   Flash Applications How to do it...  1.   If you have not already done so, go to http:  code.google.com apis maps  signup.html to sign up for the Google Maps API.  2.  Download the Google Maps API for Flash library from http:  code.google.com   apis maps documentation flash intro.html. The link is located in the  Obtaining the Interface Library section. There are two folders in the sdk folder that  is downloaded: docs and lib.  3.  Navigate to the lib folder and open it to see the two files inside. One is specific to  Flash development  map_1_16.swc , the other is specific to use with Adobe Flex  Builder  map_flex_1_16.swc . The numbers associated with the files represent the  version and may differ from what is shown here. You will use the Flash-oriented file.  4.  Make sure that Flash is closed. 5.  Create a folder named Google in the following directory:        For Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Flash CS4\ language\Configuration\Components For Mac: Macintosh HD Applications Adobe Flash CS4  Common Configuration Components  6.  Copy the map_1_16.swc file  again, the number may differ, just make sure it does   not have the word flex in the filename  into the Google folder that you just made. You  will now be able to access the component library in this file inside of Flash.  Now, you can launch Flash:  In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Ctrl Cmd N .    1.  2.  Select Flash File  ActionScript 3.0  and hit OK. 3.  Go to File  Save As and save this file as map.fla. 4.  Go to Window  Components and click on Google. Drag the GoogleMapsLibrary   component onto the stage:  180   All that will appear on the stage is an empty rectangle with a thin blue line around it to let you  know that it is selected. If you deselect the component, nothing of it will be visible. Also, the  position of it is not important. ActionScript will be used to control that.  5.

Go to Window  Actions  F9 Option F9  to pull out the Actions panel. Make sure the   Chapter 6  key frame for your actions layer is selected.  7.  Place the following code into the Actions panel:  import com.google.maps.LatLng; import com.google.maps.Map; import com.google.maps.MapEvent; import com.google.maps.MapType;  var map:Map = new Map  ; map.key = "your_api_key"; map.setSize new Point stage.stageWidth, stage.stageHeight  ; map.addEventListener MapEvent.MAP_READY, onMapReady ; this.addChild map ;  function onMapReady event:Event :void {   map.setCenter new LatLng 37.4419,-122.1419 , 14, MapType.NORMAL_ MAP_TYPE ; }  Replace "your_api_key" with the actual key from Google. Leave the  quotation marks around the key so that the code functions properly.  8.  Go to File  Publish Settings and select the Flash tab at the top of the dialog box.  181   Flash Applications  9.  Make sure that Local playback security is set to Access network only. This ensures   that the library information will be successfully retrieved from Google. Click OK.  10.  Save the file and test the movie.  How it works... The component that you downloaded from Google allows you to incorporate their map  with a modicum of code. It is pre-configured to allow easy usage for you, as with any   other component.  182   Chapter 6  The ActionScript used imports four Google Map libraries to call upon in the rest of your code:  latitude longitude, map, map events, and types of maps.  The variable sets up the map class and names it, simply, map.  The map key is set to the key you received from Google when you signed up for the Google  Map API. It allows you to access their libraries on your site or blog.  map.setSize matches the size of the map to your stage size.  The event listener and handler  the function  work together to load the map so that the  coordinates you use are at the center of the map when it loads. The zoom level is also set, in  this case, at 14. The handler function also sets the type of map, in this case, a normal map.  this.addChild map ; tells the map to load into the root level of the SWF.  When the SWF is implemented on your site, it will pull map information from the Google Maps  API library to display the most updated version of the map that exists in the library. It will  display in the fashion that you coded in your ActionScript.  There's more... Google provides additional information about the different types of maps that can be used,  the different zoom levels available, and offers up a way to add informational text. There are  still more options at http:  code.google.com than are included here.  Types of maps There are more Map Attributes than just NORMAL_MAP_TYPE. There are also:   f SATELLITE_MAP_TYPE  Google Earth image   f HYBRID_MAP_TYPE  mixture of NORMAL and SATELLITE   f PHYSICAL_MAP_TYPE  relief map   f DEFAULT_MAP_TYPES  an array of NORMAL, SATELLITE, HYBRID, and PHYSICAL   Zoom levels Zoom levels, according to Google, range from 0-19. 0 = the entire world. 19 = individual  buildings. With SATELLITE view, the zoom level goes to 20.  Zoom levels are not entirely consistent as different levels of information are  available for different parts of the world.  183   Flash Applications Adding an Information Bubble According to Google, to add an informative bubble in the center of the map, replace the  onMapReady function with the following code in your Flash file:  function onMapReady event:Event :void {   map.setCenter new LatLng 37.4419,-122.1419 , 14, MapType.NORMAL_MAP_ TYPE ; map.openInFoWindow getCenter  , new InfoWindowOptions {    title: "Instructions", "Drag to scroll."    }  ; }  See also   f XML Google Maps 1.12.1  Datafeedr Random Ads V2  Version 2.0  The following section talks about the XML Google Maps Datafeedr Random Ads V2 plugin.

Chapter 6  187   7  Flash Themes  In this chapter, we will cover the following:   f CSS  f WordPress theme hierarchy  f WordPress template tags  f Customizing Kubrik  Introduction WordPress themes are made up of CSS stylesheets, template files, and template tags. In  this chapter, we present an in-depth look at all three. We'll then apply this knowledge by  customizing the default Kubrik theme.  Picking a theme—free or premium Most people new to WordPress start out with a free theme. The advantage is obvious—there is  no upfront direct monetary cost. Plus, there are literally thousands of free themes out there to  choose from. This can be a good option, depending on your goals. However, if you are serious  about your site, we strongly encourage you to consider purchasing a premium theme. The  advantages of a premium theme authored by a competent and reputable designer include:  expandability, theme documentation and support, cross-browser compatibility, and future  upgrades. The costs are reasonable, ranging from $25 to $100.  Whether you pick a free or a premium theme, do yourself a favor and do some research. Make  sure it has the functionality you require. Your website's visual identity and core functions will  be based on this code, so be sure that you have the right starting point and a solid structure.   Flash Themes What to look for i         f A reputable and experienced theme author.  f Extensibility—does the theme design allow for customization? There should    be a theme options page, and the design should not rely upon one large   background image.   f It uses CSS, instead of tables, for structure.  f It is standards-compliant: valid CSS and XHTML.  f Cross-browser optimized: determine what browsers you will be supporting. Check   the site in IE6, IE7, Chrome, Safari, and FireFox. Don't take their word for it—use   the following website: http:  www.browsershots.org   f Support documentation: comprehensive documentation will be helpful as you   customize a theme.  CSS A basic understanding of CSS is essential if you plan on customizing a theme. Each theme  has one or more stylesheets—and the name is often style.css.  Getting ready The stylesheet contains many entries that determine how a theme looks. Each entry is called  a selector, and each selector has at least one property with a value. All of these rules together  create the theme, by specifying all of the structural elements, such as the width of the page  and columns, the colors used, fonts, alignment, background images, etc.  How to do it... CSS syntax is very important. It is always the same, and looks like this:  selector {property:value;}  Let us emphasize:  1.  The properties and values must be wrapped in curly braces. 2.  A colon  :  must separate a property and a value. 3.  A semicolon  ;  terminates the value, allowing the computer to continue reading.  If you disrupt this syntax, your site will probably not display correctly, or at all.  190   All of your favorite HTML tags can be styled as a CSS selector. Some examples follow for the  common HTML tags body, a href, h1, and p:  How it works... The selector may be one of three types:   f HTML tag  f class  f ID  body { background-color: white; padding: 10px; }  a  { color: 000000; }  h1 { font-size: 24px; }  p { font-size 14px; line-height: 18px; }  h1, h2, h3 { font-color:  000000; }  p, body { line-height: 18px; }  img.centered { display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; }  Selectors can be grouped by simply using a comma:  It is very conceivable that your design could require more than one style for HTML tags.  Classes allow you to do this. A class starts with a period  .  and can be used as many times  as you want:  Chapter 7  191   Flash Themes  img.alignright { display:inline; margin:0 0 2px 7px; padding:4px; } img.alignleft { display:inline; margin:0 7px 2px 0; padding:4px; }  To apply a class using XHTML, use the following syntax:  should be <img source="http:  yourdomain images example.jpg"  alt="your   image" class="centered"  >  Classes do not need to include an HTML tag. Normally, this strategy is used when a class   will not be limited to one tag, such as:  Another common approach is to use a class with or without an HTML tag when the class  will be applied to a   tag, affecting all of the content found within:  .alignright { float:right; }  .feedback {    color: ccc;    text-align: right; }  .comments h3{ margin:40px auto 20px; padding:0; }  Here is an example of a class being applied to a  . The entire contents  a template  tag, which we will explore soon  will be right aligned:                     <?php comments_popup_link __ 'Comments  0 ' , __ 'Comments   1 ' , __ 'Comments  % '  ; ?>       192   An ID always starts with a pound sign   . An ID can only be used once per page:  Chapter 7  page { background-color:white; border:1px solid 959596; margin:20px auto; padding:0; width:760px; }  header { background-color:73A0C5; height:200px; margin:0 0 0 1px; padding:0; width:758px; }  footer { margin:0 auto; padding:0; width:760px; }  ID's are applied like this:      Block and inline elements Before proceeding, it is worthwhile to review an important aspect of how HTML works.  This will clarify how   and   tags are used and why they, and other tags,  behave as they do.  HTML can be displayed in one of three ways: block, inline, or hidden. Block elements take up  the full width of the space available, with a new line before and after. The   tag is the most  familiar example of a block element. The   tag is also a block element, as are headings   ... , unordered lists  , and list items  .    tags are simply empty tags, or divisions, that hold other elements and create structure.  Think of them like containers.   is the generic block level tag.  Inline elements get applied without extra spacing. Common inline tags include anchor, bold,  italics, image, line break and span:  ,  ,  ,    , and  .    is the generic inline tag  a container for inline formatting .  The   tag is an example of a hidden element.  193   As mentioned above, tags have a default setting. So, if you don't declare the display property,  the tag will use the its default setting. However, you can easily change how any tag is  displayed via CSS. Simply set the display property to one of the three allowed values:  Flash Themes  display:block; display:inline; display:none;  Commenting Comments are incredibly useful. They explain to humans the purpose of code. Also, comments  can be used to keep track of revisions. If you are unsure about a change you are going to  make to your stylesheet, you can non-destructively edit by placing the piece to be changed  inside of a comment.  Comments in CSS may take up more than one line and they start with  * and end with *   Here is an example of non-destructive editing. See how all of the values are changed, but   the originals are preserved? A search for CHANGED will quickly take us to the modified parts  of the stylesheet:  header { background-color:ffffff;  * CHANGED from 73A0C5 *  height:150px;  * CHANGED from 200px *  margin:10px;  * CHANGED from 0 0 0 1px *  padding:5px;  * CHANGED from 0 *  width:858px;  * CHANGED from 758px *  }  Template files and theme structure Once you have an understanding of the CSS basics, getting familiar with the files that make  up your theme is the next step.  Getting ready We've mentioned this before, but it bears repeating that there are no "pages"  in the sense of  a single static, tables-based HTML page  in a PHP-driven site like WordPress. All of the data  that you add to WordPress  including posts, pages, comments, and users   is added to the  MySQL database. The data is filtered through a theme along with the help of plugins to create  a website with different pages. But each page is made up of several different pieces. Within  a theme, common elements  such as the header, footer, and sidebar  exist as separate PHP  template files. These pieces are combined and served based on the theme structure and  according to actions taken by a user  such as clicking or searching .  194   Chapter 7  On the front end, your users are able to navigate to  and bookmark  URLs that seem a lot  like pages. However, hopefully, you are starting to understand that these URLs, such as the  homepage, the category archive view  list of the posts in a given category , or an individual  post or page, are in fact a combination of several files. This approach  abandoning static  pages and separating content from design  allows you greater flexibility and ease of use.  For instance, if you want to, change the header, this is done in one place  one time  and the  change occurs automatically and is site wide.  How to do it... Let's look at index.php of the default Kubrik theme to get a better sense of how all  this works:  1.  Click on Appearance  Editor. 2.   In the right-hand column below the Templates heading, click on index.php.  The very first lines call header.php:  <?php  **  * @package WordPress  * @subpackage Classic_Theme  *  get_header  ; ?>  We're going to disregard the comments  a form of file documentation . Simply realize that    inserts the file header.php.  Similarly, the file ends with a call to insert the file footer.php:    These are specific forms of template tags, called include tags. Their purpose, as we have  seen, is to provide an easy way to insert the basic template files:   f Header:    f Sidebar:    f Comments:    f Footer:    To include any template file, use the following:     This code looks in your theme directory  wp-content themes mytheme  for a template  file of the given name, and inserts it.  For more information, see: http:  codex.wordpress.org Include_Tags  195   Flash Themes How it works... Now you know how template files are combined within a given file. The next step is to  understand which template files are displayed based on user actions. Depending on where  a user clicks, different template files will be used. The specifics depend upon your theme  structure, but here we present a brief overview of the concept of template hierarchy.  Logic built into WordPress evaluates the URL of the page a user is on, and looks for the  appropriate templates in an order that goes from most specific to most broad. We already  mentioned that every theme must have the most basic files: header.php, index.php,  sidebar.php, comments.php, and footer.php. These are the basics  and the  backups  that will be used if no other template files exist. However, a theme can have   many more template files that may be used.  If you are on the homepage, WordPress will use either home.php or, if no home.php file  exists, index.php.  If you are looking at an individual post, WordPress will use either single.php or, if no  single.php file exists, index.php.  If you are looking at a WordPress page, WordPress will first use the page template that has  been assigned, if none, then page.php or, if no page.php file exists, index.php. Page  templates allow for unique styling of a given page.  If you are looking at a category archive  all of the posts in a given category—the display that  happens when you click on a category , WordPress will first use the most specific category  template: category-slug.php  the slug is typically the category name—slug templates were  added in WP 2.9  or category-id.php  where id is the ID number of your category .  If neither of these exist, then category.php is used. If no category.php, archive. php will be used. Otherwise, index.php is used. This format allows you to have different  templates for each category.  There's more... For more information, see: http:  codex.wordpress.org Template_Hierarchy  and: http:  codex.wordpress.org The_Loop_in_Action  Template tags Finally, we arrive at the concept of template tags. These are bits of code, specific to  WordPress, that insert information from your MySQL database.  196   Chapter 7  Getting ready Each tag has a default action. This action can be extended or modified with parameters. You  don't need to know PHP to use template tags. In fact, template tags make it easy for people  who are not PHP programmers to use the dynamic nature and functionality of PHP.  How to do it... Let's break things down. Here's a common example: you want to display a list of your  categories. Guess what? A template tag will dynamically spit out the list. Saving your   time—since you do not need to type them out individually. You can also add categories   or rename an existing category, and these changes will automatically be available throughout  the live site. Pretty neat? Here is how it works:     1.  Template tags need to be wrapped in PHP tags, so they must start with <?php and   end with ?>. That's as much PHP as you need to know to access the basics. The next  part is the tag itself: wp_list_categories.  2.  Then, the parenthesis, and  like CSS  we need to include the semi-colon for syntax:   ; 3.   If the parentheses are empty, the default settings will be used. However, you can  optionally pass parameters to the tag within the parenthesis to modify the function.   If you do this, the parameters must be enclosed in single quotes  'parameter' .  Of course, until you spend a lot of time in WP, you won't know what these parameters are.  Luckily, a quick search in the codex will tell you all you need to know.  How it works... For wp_list_categories, there are twenty parameters available. Let's take a look at  an advanced example:  <?php wp_list_categories 'title_li=&exclude=1,2&orderby=count&sh ow_count=1' ; ?>  title_li= is a tricky, but useful, starting point. The default settings for wp_list_ categories sticks the word "Categories" above the list. If you want to put your own title, you  put the value in like this: title_li=' . __ 'My Own Title'  . ' You can include  HTML tags, so to wrap your title in a   tag, it would look like this: title_li= ' .  __ 'My Own Title'  . '   To display no title at all, the value is set to nothing  null : title_li=  197   Flash Themes  The ampersand  &  allows us to use multiple parameters. It has nothing to do  with the title.  exclude does exactly what you might think, it excludes specific category IDs from the list. The  default action is to display all categories. To exclude more than one category, separate the IDs  with a comma  no space .  orderby determines the order in which the categories are displayed. The default value is  to order alphabetically, by name. Other values include: ID, slug, count, and term_group.  Here, we order by the count which will display categories with the most posts first and those  with the least number of posts last.  show_count is a Boolean operator. That means it is either false or true, accepting only  one of two values  either 0 or 1 . This parameter will include the total number of posts  in  parenthesis  next to the category name. The default is 0  false . In our example, we set the  value to 1  true .  There's more... For more information, see: http:  codex.wordpress.org Stepping_Into_ Template_Tags  The complete list of template tags can be found here: http:  codex.wordpress.org  Template_Tags  Customizing Kubrik Now that we are familiar with the pieces that control the look and content of your theme,   let's apply this knowledge and make some changes to the default Kubrik theme.  Getting ready The first step is to make a list of the changes that you want to make. Here's what we've   come up with:   f Increase width to 980px  f Increase font sizes in sidebar  f Use a graphic header  198   Chapter 7  We've picked 980px as our target width because this size is optimized for a 1024 screen  resolution and works well in a grid layout. Several CSS adjustments will be necessary to realize  this modification, as well as using an image editing program  we will be using Photoshop .  How to do it... To increase the page width, the first step is to determine which entries in the CSS stylesheet  are controlling the width. Using Firebug to inspect the page  as seen below , we find that the  selector page has a value of 760px for the width property. And header has a width of  758px  less because there is a 1px left margin . The .narrowcolumn selector gives the main  content column a width of 450px. And sidebar has a width of 190px. Finally, footer has  a width of 760px.  So, we will increase page and footer to 980px. header we will increase to 978px. Let's  apply all of the additional 220px width to .narrowcolumn. Taking note of the existing 45px  left margin, our new value for the width property will be 700px. That means sidebar width  will remain at 190px, but the margin-left will need to be increased from 545px to 765px.  1.  Click on Appearance  Editor. 2.   In the right-hand column, below the Templates heading, click on style.css.  Scroll past the section that says  * Begin Typography & Colors * , until you get to the  section that says  * Begin Structure * :  Make the following changes to the stylesheet  style.css , commenting as appropriate to  document your changes.  page {    background-color: white;    margin: 20px auto;  199   Flash Themes     padding: 0;    width: 980px;  * increased from 760px *     border: 1px solid 959596;    }  header {    background-color: 73a0c5;    margin: 0 0 0 1px;    padding: 0;    height: 200px;    width: 978px;  * increased from 758px *     }  .narrowcolumn {    float: left;    padding: 0 0 20px 45px;    margin: 0px 0 0;    width: 700px;  * increased from 450px  *     }  sidebar { margin-left:765px;  * increaseed from  545px *  padding:20px 0 10px; width:190px; }  footer {    padding: 0;    margin: 0 auto;    width: 980px;  * increased from 760px *     clear: both;    }  Adjustments via Photoshop We'll also need to use an image editing program to modify the three background images  that create the rounded corners: kubrikbg-ltr.jpg, kubrickheader.jpg, and  kubrickfooter.jpg. In this example, we modify kubrik-ltr.jpg  the background image  for page , a 760px image.  1.  Open up the image in Photoshop, select all, copy, create a new document  with a   2.   white or transparent background , and paste  Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-N, Ctrl-V . Increase the canvas size  Image  Canvas Size  to 980px, keeping the image  centered on the left-hand side by clicking on the left-pointing arrow.  3.  Select one half of the image with the Rectangular Marquee Tool, cut and paste.  200   4.  Use the Move Tool to drag the new layer to the right-hand side of the canvas. In this   case, it does not matter if you can see the transparent background or if your selection  was exactly one half the image. Since the middle of the image is simply a white  background, we are really only concerned with the borders on the left and right. The  following screenshot shows the background image cut in half and moved over:  Chapter 7  5.  Save for Web and Devices, exporting as a jpg. Then, replace the existing kubrikbg-  ltr.jpg with your modified version via FTP.  The steps are similar for both kubrickheader.jpg and kubrickfooter.jpg—. Increase   the canvas size and copy paste from the existing image to increase the image size without  stretching or distortion. The only difference is that you need to copy and paste different parts  of the image in order to preserve the background gradient and or top and bottom borders.  In order to complete our theme customization, the width of .widecolumn  will need to be increased from 450px to 700px  and the 150px margin should  be converted to a 45px margin, the same as .narrowcolumn . Also, the  kubrikwide.jpg background image will need to be modified with an image  editing program to increase the size from 760px to 980px. Then, the individual  post view will look as good as the homepage. By following the same steps as  above, you should now be prepared to make this final customization yourself.  Our next goal is to increase the sizes of the sidebar fonts. Firebug helps us to pinpoint the  relevant CSS. sidebar h2 has a font-size of 1.2em  around line 123 of style.css . Let's  change this to 1.75em. sidebar has font-size of 1em. Let's increase this to 1.25em.  To use a graphic in the header, open up kubrickheader.jpg in a new Photoshop  document. Use the magic wand tool to select and delete the blue gradient with rounded  corners. Now, use the rounded rectangle tool to insert your own custom header area. You can  apply another gradient, if desired. We choose to apply a bevel and emboss texture to our grey  rectangle. Then, to paste in some photos, decreasing their opacity to 50%.  201   Flash Themes  In a short time, we've been able to modify Kubrik by re-writing CSS and using an image-editing  program. This is the most basic technique for theme modification. Here is the result:  There's more... Let's explore theme customization in more detail, continuing to use the default Kubrik theme.  In the subsequent sections, we will add a second widgetized sidebar and create a custom  template for a page. These final two goals provide the opportunity to apply our understanding  of template hierarchy and the use of template tags.  Adding a widgetized sidebar Adding a widgetized sidebar is an intermediate task. Let's make a unique sidebar which we  can use in a custom page template.  First, let's add the CSS we'll need to the stylesheet. Our new sidebar is similar to the original.  The larger font size and dashed border are the only stylistic differences:  sidebar-custom { padding: 0px 0 10px 10px; width:190px; margin-left: 765px; border-left: 2px dashed 000000; font-size: 1.5em; }  202   We will also add our new selector to other stylesheet entries to avail ourselves of   existing formatting:  Chapter 7  sidebar h2, sidebar-custom h2 {    margin: 5px 0 0;    padding: 0;    }  sidebar ul li, sidebar-custom ul li {    list-style-type: none;    list-style-image: none;    margin-bottom: 15px;    }  sidebar ul ul, sidebar ul ol, sidebar-custom ul ul {    margin: 5px 0 0 10px;    }  Now, let's create a the sidebar itself. Create a new document in your text editor. We start  with a   to hold the contents of the sidebar. Then, start an unordered list, followed by a  function to display whatever widgets have been enabled for the custom sidebar. Next, some  data to display in case no widgets are being used. Then, the end of the unordered list and the  end of the if statement, followed by the end of the custom sidebar. Save this document as  sidebar-custom.php and upload to the theme directory:                   <?php if   !function_exists 'dynamic_sidebar'   !dynamic_ sidebar 'custom'    : ?>            Archives                                                                 <?php wp_list_categories 'show_count=1&title_ li= Categories ' ; ?>                                              203   Flash Themes  The final step is to modify the theme functions to register our new sidebar. The easiest way to  add multiple sidebars is like this:  register_sidebars 2 ;  Click on Appearance  Editor and click on functions.php.  You will see that Kubrik is set up to register a single sidebar:  if   function_exists 'register_sidebar'    {    register_sidebar array        'before_widget' => ' ',       'after_widget' => ' ',       'before_title' => ' ',       'after_title' => ' ',      ; }  Let's modify this entry to give the original sidebar a name  original , and then copy and paste  the register sidebar function and give the second array another name  custom :  if   function_exists 'register_sidebar'    {    register_sidebar array           'name' => 'original',       'before_widget' => ' ',       'after_widget' => ' ',       'before_title' => ' ',       'after_title' => ' ',      ;     if   function_exists 'register_sidebar'        register_sidebar array       'name' => 'custom',         'before_widget' => ' ',         'after_widget' => ' ',         'before_title' => ' ',         'after_title' => ' ',       ; }  For more information, see: http:  codex.wordpress.org Widgets_API  204   Creating a custom page template It's easy to create a custom page template.  Start by creating some CSS for the new page. We'll use the .narrowcolumn entry as a  starting point:  Chapter 7  .customcolumn {    float:left;    padding:0  40px ;    margin-left: 20px;    width:665px;    background: F5B82A; }  Now, create a new document in your text editor. The first thing you need is to declare the  template name. This is wrapped in a PHP tag and commented out, as follows:  <?php  * Template Name: My Custom Page Template *  ?>  Next, copy and paste the code that we will be starting with. In our case, we'll copy and paste  the entire text of the page.php file from the default theme folder. You could use any existing  template, such as index.php or archive.php, depending on your goals.  We also have the opportunity to use any template tags we choose in our page template. As an  example, here we include the comment form:     To use our new sidebar, simply modify the existing template tag:     205   Flash Themes  To apply the new template, edit any page. In the Attributes menu on the right-hand side, there  is a Template menu. Pull down to find and click to select the new template: My Custom Page  Template. Click Update Page to save your changes. You can also apply a template via the  Quick Edit menu in the Edit Pages screen:  Here is the finished code:  <?php  * Template Name: My Custom Page Template *  ?>   * @package WordPress   * @subpackage Default_Theme  <?php   **   *   206  get_header  ; ?>             if function_exists 'bcn_display'       bcn_display  ;  <?php  {  }  ?>                     ">                                      Read the rest of this  page &raquo; ' ; ?>                '  Pages:<  strong> ', 'after' => ' ', 'next_or_number' => 'number'  ; ?>      ', ' ' ; ?>                                                You have now learned the basics of theme customization. To summarize, many changes  are made simply by modifying CSS rules. Other changes require the use of an image editing  program. You've also learned how to add a widgetized sidebar, and how to create a custom  page template that uses template tags to output content from the database. Keep studying,  and practicing, and you will soon be able to modify any theme, or even create your own!  Chapter 7  207   8  Flash Animations  In this chapter, we will cover the following:    f Creating a shape tween  f Creating a classic tween  f Creating a motion tween  f Using the Motion Editor  f Using motion presets  f Animating with the Bone tool  f Animating inside movie clips  f Creating a button  Introduction This chapter covers creating your own Flash animations for your blog. The focus here is on  animating in the Flash timeline. The lessons here are to help you with the fundamentals of  Flash animation and give you a jump start on the process.  Using symbols is an important part of animating in Flash. There are three different types  of symbols: graphic symbols, buttons, and movie clips. All symbols in Flash have some sort   of timeline:   f The timeline of a graphic symbol allows multiple layers to exist in the same symbol,   but not animation. Graphic symbols hold static information.   f A button has a timeline that is not time-based, but user-based. This means that the   button symbol instance changes based on what the user does with their mouse,  rather than on time passing. A button symbol can hold graphic symbol instances and  movie clip symbol instances as well as multiple layers.   Flash Animations   f A movie clip symbol has a robust timeline that accommodates multiple layers as   well as animations that happen over time. Additionally, a movie clip symbol can hold  graphic symbol instances, instances of different movie clips, and button symbol  instances.   f Placing or creating something inside of a symbol is referred to as nesting.  Creating a shape tween Shape tweens are used when you want to change one shape into a different shape. This  is best done on a one to one ratio, for example, to change one circle into one star. Also, simple  shapes will give you results that are at least somewhat predictable. Using a shape tween on  complex shapes will often yield surprising results. If you try to use a shape tween to make it  look like a caterpillar is morphing into a butterfly, you will get a tangled mess in the middle.  Shape tweens work on objects, primitive objects, and merged shapes.  How to do it...  1.   In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Ctrl Cmd N . Select Flash  File  ActionScript 3.0  and hit OK.  2.  Double-click on Layer 1 and rename it Shape Tween. 3.  Use any one of the drawing tools to create a shape or object of any size and color    you want. Remember to keep it simple. For instance, create an oval by dragging   the Oval tool on the stage.  4.  Right-click Ctrl-click on the key frame in the timeline and choose Create   Shape Tween.  5.  Select a frame several frames down the timeline  frame 10 or higher  and make a   new key frame  F6 . Change the color of the shape on this key frame.  Your timeline should look, roughly, like this:  6.  Hit Return to see the movie play inside of Flash. This is a basic shape tween. 7.  Select the shape in the last key frame of your tween. Then, delete it. Make a different  shape with a different tool. Make it whatever size and color you want. Place it where  ever you want on the stage.  210   Chapter 8  8.  Hit Return to see the movie play in Flash. This is a morph effect. 9.  Save the FLA file and test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return  to generate the SWF file.  How it works... Shapes and objects in Flash are vector-based. Vectors have anchor points that describe  the points where the line defining the edge of the shape or object changes direction. If the  beginning and end shape have the same number of anchor points  especially in the same  locations , the tween will work well and be visually predictable.  In a shape tween, Flash is trying to find the tween of least resistance. It is trying to make the  mathematical change from one shape to another in the amount of frames you allotted by  using the least amount of file size. It is also matching up the anchor points of your shapes as  well as possible.  See also   f Creating a classic tween  f Creating a motion tween  Creating a classic tween Classic tweens are used when you want to animate one symbol instance. The animation can  be a transformation, such as rotation or scale, or a movement change. Also, with the use of  symbol instances, color effects can be tweened so that a gradual color shift is possible.  In previous versions of Flash  CS3 and prior , a classic tween  is referred to as a motion tween.  Classic tweens are best used on symbol instances. Graphic symbols, movie clips, and   buttons can have a classic tween applied to them. Any vector or bitmap can be converted   into a symbol.  How to do it...  1.   In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Ctrl Cmd N . Select Flash File   ActionScript 3.0  and hit OK.  2.  Double-click on Layer 1 and rename it Classic Tween. 3.  Use any one of the drawing tools to create a shape or object of any size and color   you want. Alternatively, you can import  Ctrl Cmd R  a file, such as a JPG, to use.  211   Flash Animations  4.  Select the item s  that you want to animate. Go to Modify  Convert to Symbol   F8 . For Type, choose Graphic to keep this simple. For Name, name the symbol  g_whateverItIs  for example, if it's a circle, name it g_circle, if it's a red dog, name it  g_redDog. . Hit OK.  5.  Right-click Ctrl-click on the key frame in the timeline that is holding the symbol   instance and choose Create Classic Tween.  6.  Select a frame several frames down the timeline  frame 10 or 20 or higher  and   make a new key frame  F6 . Your timeline should look, roughly, like this:  7.  Use the Selection tool to move the symbol instance to a different location on the   stage. For instance, if the symbol instance is on the left side of the stage at frame  1, move the symbol to the right side of the stage at your last frame so that the  animation will show the symbol instance moving from left to right.  8.  Hit Return to see the movie play inside Flash. This is a basic classic tween.  More key frames can be added to any animation when you want a change to  happen in the animation. Select a frame and press F6 to add another key  frame. Change something about the symbol instance  such as its location .  Changing the position of an element that is animated changes its direction.  9.  Save the FLA file and test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return  to generate the SWF file.  How it works... Classic tweens are used to animate one element changing over time. Flash moves the  same symbol instance from one location or orientation to another over the course of the  number of frames you specify. Every time you want a change in the animation  for example,  rotation, direction, or scale , you must create a key frame. The key frames are the points in  time where the symbol instance is drawn. The tweened, or transitional, frames are created  through the automatic interpolation of the contents of the key frames. Basically, math is used  to automatically render the tween so that you don't need to draw every single frame of the  animation in Flash. This not only cuts down on the time you spend animating, it also reduces  your file size.  212   Chapter 8  There's more... You can do a lot more:  Tweening color and Alpha changes  1.  Select one of the key frames in your timeline by clicking on it. 2.  Now, click on the symbol instance that is drawn on that key frame by clicking on it in   the document window with the Selection tool. In the Properties panel, change the Style from None to Tint:  3.   4.  Choose a tint color by either adjusting the sliders or clicking in the color rectangle to  access a swatch panel. Also, choose a tint percentage. 100% will make the chosen  tint color completely opaque over the top of your entire symbol instance. If you prefer to change the transparency of the symbol instance, select Alpha instead  of Tint from the Style drop down. Adjust the slider as desired:  5.         0% makes the symbol instance completely transparent at the key  frame selected. 100% makes the symbol instance completely opaque at the key  frame selected.  6.  Hit Return to see the movie play in the timeline in Flash.   213   Flash Animations See also   f Creating a shape tween  f Creating a motion tween  Creating a motion tween Motion tweens as they currently exist is in Flash CS4 are new to Flash. In previous versions  of Flash, the term motion tween was used. However, it was used to describe what is currently  called a classic tween.  The process for setting up a motion tween is basically the same as that for setting up a classic  tween.  The difference is how they function after they are set up.  It is very easy to make a  motion tween follow a curved path rather than a straight line path.  Also, motion tweens can be  affected in a more advanced fashion through the use of the Motion Editor. Motion Presets also  exist now that apply pre-made motion tweens to your selected symbol instance.  Like classic tweens, motion tweens can be applied to any symbol instance.  How to do it...  1.   In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Ctrl Cmd N . Select Flash File   ActionScript 3.0  and hit OK.  2.  Double-click on Layer 1 and rename it Motion Tween. 3.  Use any one of the drawing tools to create a shape or object of any size and color you   want. Alternatively, you can import  Ctrl Cmd R  a file, such as a JPG, to use.  4.  Select the item s  that you want to animate. Go to Modify  Convert to Symbol   F8 . For Type, choose Graphic to keep this simple. For Name, name the symbol  g_whateverItIs  i.e.—if it's a circle, name it g_circle, if it's a red dog, name it  g_redDog. . Hit OK.  5.  Right-click Ctrl-click on the key frame in the timeline that is holding the symbol   instance and choose Create Motion Tween.  214   6.   If your layer only had the initial key frame in it, Flash will provide one second's worth  of frames for you. If your layer had more than the initial key frame in it, Flash will  convert the existing frames into tweened frames but not generate additional frames.  Your timeline should look, roughly, like this:  Chapter 8  7.  To add more time to your tween, select any frame and hit F5 to simply add time, but   leave the symbol instance unchanged. Hit F6 to add a key frame so that you can  change something about the symbol instance.  8.  At any point in time in the timeline, move the playback head to a frame and hit   F6 to generate a key frame and adjust the symbol instance. You can use the Free  Transform tool to rotate, skew, and change scale.  9.  Notice that if you change the location of the symbol instance, a path that has dots  on it appears that connects the symbol instances from location to location. Use the  Selection tool to bend this path. Your symbol instance will now travel in a curved line.  How it works... Motion tweens are object-based rather than timeline-based. This is different than how classic  and shape tweens work. You are still able to set up the tween in much the same way. Adding  basic key frames can also occur in the same way. The key frames show up as small diamonds  instead of black circles since the symbol instance is not exactly redrawn at those points for a  motion tween. The diamonds show the location of a change rather than a complete redraw.  See also   f Creating a shape tween  f Creating a classic tween  215   Flash Animations Using the Motion Editor When you are using motion tweens to create your animation, you can use the Motion Editor  to gain more control over the animation. The Motion Editor gives you the ability to change  the location, scale, rotation, color effects, filters, and ease of your animation separately. You  can address each of these properties in your animation at different points on your timeline  without impacting other properties at that same point in time. It is as if each property has its  own timeline inside of the motion tween. For instance, a symbol instance can change location  without impacting a color effect change that was already taking place.  Getting ready Use a file that already has a motion tween created. See Creating a motion tween if you need  further instruction on accomplishing this. If you are new to Flash, start with a simple motion  tween where the symbol instance only changes direction.  How to do it...  1.   In your Flash file, select your tween span by clicking on the tweened frames in  the timeline.  2.  Go to Window  Motion Editor if the panel is not already accessible. It should   look something like this for a basic animation:  216   Chapter 8  3.  There are separate sections for Basic Motion, Transformation, etc. To the right, each  section has settings that can be adjusted. At the far right, each editable property has  a representation of the timeline illustrating how that property changes over time in  the animation.  4.  To adjust the position of the symbol instance at the start of the animation, move   the playback head to the beginning of the timeline. Change the x or y coordinates  by clicking on the blue numbers and typing in new numbers.  5.  Test your movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . 6.  Back in the Motion Editor, also adjust the scale of your symbol instance. To make  a change in scale part way through the animation, move the playback head into a  position where there is not currently a key frame. Click on the diamond shape to   the left of the timeline to add a key frame. Now, change the scale for that motion   key frame. If you wish to add a color effect, such as Alpha or Tint, click on the plus  +  button to  the right of Color Effect and choose the desired effect. Select or create a key frame  as needed. Change the settings available.  7.   8.  To add a filter, click the plus  +  button to the right of Filters and select a filter. Move  the playback head over a key frame that already exists for Filters or create a new key  frame. Change any settings.  9.  Ease is a little more involved. The default ease setting is Simple  Slow . You can   make your animation ease in or out by adjusting the ease from -100 to 100. Negative  numbers will ease your animation in. This means it starts slow and speeds up.  Positive numbers ease your animation out so that it starts fast and then slows down.  An ease of 0 keeps your animation at a constant rate all the way through it.  10.  Add at least one more type of ease. To do this, click the plus  +  button to the right of   Ease and choose one or more from the list. Some of the preset eases have specific  uses in mind and are named to represent those uses  for example, Bounce is for  making things bounce . You can also choose Custom and create your own ease with  as many key frames as you need.  11.  Now that you have more than one ease selected and or edited, you can apply   different eases to different elements.  For instance, under Basic Motion, change  the ease for X to Simple  Slow  and for Y to Bounce.  12. Test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return .  Any property listed used in the Motion Editor can have an ease method applied to it. The ease  applies to that property for the length of the entire tween span.   217   Flash Animations How it works... The Motion Editor breaks your animation down into its separate editable parts and allows  you to adjust them by creating individual-level key frames for those parts. A scale change can  happen at a different point in time than a change in position. With a motion tween and the  Motion Editor, those changes are kept track of and made editable in a more advanced and  ultimately more controllable fashion.  Using motion presets Flash CS4 has a number of pre-made motion tweens ready for you to use. In this recipe, you  will apply motion presets to symbol instances.  Getting ready Have a file open that contains a movie clip symbol instance. If you do not have such a file,  make a new file in Flash, create a shape or import a file, and then go to Modify  Convert to  Symbol. Name the symbol, choose movie clip for Type, and hit OK. You are ready to roll.  How to do it...  already open.  1.  Go to Window  Motion Presets to get the Motion Presets panel if it is not   2.  Double-click on the Default Presets folder to gain access to the presets. 3.  Select your symbol instance by clicking on it with the Selection tool. 4.  Click on a preset, such as fly-in-blur-left and click Apply. 5.  Save and test your movie  Ctrl Cmd Return .  How it works... Motion presets are saved tweens. The settings used to create an animation can be saved and  reapplied to any other symbol instance. The Motion Presets work best on movie clips, but can  also be applied to graphic symbols and buttons with differing degrees of success.  There's more... The following section takes this discussion further.  218   Chapter 8  Creating your own motion preset 1.  Create a movie clip symbol instance. 2.  Right-click on the key frame containing it in the timeline and choose    Create Motion Tween.  3.  Move the playback head  the red rectangle  to the last frame of the tween    and hit F6 to create a new motion key frame.  4.  Change something about the symbol instance. For example, to create a fade-out  effect, click on the symbol instance on the stage with the Selection tool. Then, go  to the Properties panel and change the Style of the Color Effect to Alpha. Turn the  Alpha down to 0%. Make sure the Alpha is still set to 100% at the first key frame.  5.  Click on the tween span in the timeline to select it. 6.   In the Motion Presets panel, click on the Save selection as preset button on the  bottom left of the panel. Name the preset. This adds the motion tween settings to the  Custom Presets folder for you to use at your leisure on any symbol instance.  See also   f Creating a motion tween  f Using motion presets  Animating with the Bone tool The Bone tool is used to create an armature to connect and animate separate symbol  instances. It is a direct way of controlling elements that are supposed to be animated in a sort  of chain reaction like the movement of limbs. This recipe gives you the run down on how to get  started with the tool.  You start out by figuring out what is going to be the trunk of your armature and then   connect the branches to it. The trunk is fairly stationary  like a tree trunk  and the   branches, or limbs, move.  Getting ready You can use the bonetool.fla file in the Chapter 9 folder. If you are already comfortable  with this sort of animation, or are an intermediate Flash user, create your own file. In order for  the Bone tool to work, each piece to be animated should be a symbol instance. You can take a  look at bonetool_done.fla to see an example of an animation done with the Bone tool.  219   Flash Animations How to do it...  1.  Select each symbol instance in turn with the Transform tool and move the transform   point  the circle inside the bounding box  to the position a joint would be in. The demo  file, bonetool.fla, is already prepped. Feel free to adjust any of the transform  points.  2.  Use the Bone tool  it looks like a bone in the Tool box  to connect the symbol instance   that will serve as the torso  trunk  to each of the limbs  branches . Drag from the  torso of the balloon man to one of his shoulders:  3.  After connecting the torso to the shoulder, connect the shoulder to the elbow. 4.  Repeat this until all of the limbs are attached. The order you do this in is not   important. If it seems that you are getting the armature coming out from the torso  instead of the shoulder, connect the other shoulder first. If problems persist, zoom in   Ctrl Cmd +  so you can aim better.  5.  Once the armature is created with the Bone tool, animate the armature. The demo is   a looping animation.  220   Chapter 8  6.  Select frame 40 for every layer you have and hit F5 to extend the timeline to that   frame. For the armature layer  it renamed itself , hit F6 at the last frame so that the  animation will loop.  7.  Move the playback head  the red rectangle  to a frame about in the middle of the   armature tween.  8.  Grab the Selection tool and drag the different connection points around. Also, drag   the end of the arms and legs around. Where you drag changes the amount of control  you have over different branches of your armature.  9.  Make as many key frames as you need by hitting F6 on different frames in   the timeline.  10.  Save and test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return .  Animating inside movie clips Movie clips are versatile sorts of symbols. Part of their power  is that they can contain  animations and other symbol instances. Whenever you need to have a repeating action in your  animation, you can use a movie to contain the repetitious element. This way, you only need  to animate it once instead of multiple times. More advanced examples of this technique are  used in walk cycles.  In this recipe, you will create a movie clip symbol that has an animation inside it. Then, you  will place multiple instances of this symbol on your stage. For an example of movie clips in  action, take a look at the movieclip.fla file in the Chapter 9 folder. The demo file shows  both a beginner-level use of a movie clip to create animated bubbles, as well as an advanced  use of a movie clip to animate the balloon man swimming.  How to do it...  1.   In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Ctrl Cmd N . Select Flash File   ActionScript 3.0  and hit OK.  2.  Save the file as movie_clip.fla. 3.  Double-click on Layer 1 and rename it Movie Clip. 4.  Create a shape, such as a circle.  Anything more complex is also fine. For instance, imported files can also  be used.  5.  Select the shape and go to Modify  Convert to Symbol. Name it mc_movie, or   whatever name seems appropriate. For Type, choose Movie Clip. Hit OK. Your shape  is now nested inside of the movie clip symbol.  221   Flash Animations  6.  Double-click on the symbol instance on the stage to isolate it and gain access to its  timeline. You are going to do your animation inside of the movie clip. Remember that  a movie clip has a timeline that can hold multiple layers as well as animations. Zoom  in as necessary.  7.  Once you double-click, the top left of the stage should show the bread crumbs for  your location inside the movie, such as Scene 1 and then mc_movie  or whatever  you named your symbol instance . Make sure that the breadcrumbs list the name of  your symbol instance as the last  farthest right  of the breadcrumbs. If it's not the last  one on the right, click on the breadcrumb that is the name of your movie clip so that  it becomes the last one on the right. Many things can be nested inside a movie clip,  such as bitmap images, drawing objects, and other symbol instances. If you double- click on one of these, you will isolate it and will be working in its timeline. Keep an eye  on the breadcrumbs! Make sure that the last breadcrumb listed is the correct one for  your purposes.  8.  Right-click Ctrl click on the key frame in the layer. Choose Create Shape Tween. 9.  Select frame 10 and hit F6 to duplicate your first key frame. Change something about   the shape such as its scale or location or both.  10.  Click on Scene 1 at the top left of the stage to see your main timeline again. It should   still only have one key frame even though your movie clip has ten.  11.  Test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . The movie clip loops continuously through its ten   frames as the main timeline loops continuously through its single frame.  12. If you want a gap in time before the animation loops, the easiest way to accomplish  this is to add blank frames to the end of the movie clip's timeline. Double-click on  the symbol instance again to re-enter the movie clip. Select frame 11 and hit F7.  Select frame 20, for instance, and hit F5 to extend the amount of time that nothing  shows up.  13.  Test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . 14.  Back in Flash, click on Scene 1 to see the main timeline again. Populate frame 1 with  more instances of the movie clip by dragging instances of mc_movie from the Library  panel onto the stage in different locations.  15.  Test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . The power of the movie clip should be  clearer   now. You can reuse the movie clip in the same key frame. This is useful for achieving  effects such as snow or rain falling, or stars blinking in the sky.  16.  Back in Flash, make a new layer and name it Delay. You can make additional layers and   place the movie clip at different points of time so that the movie clips are not perfectly  synced. This adds believability to your animation. Select frame 7 and hit F7 to make a  new blank key frame. Drag multiple instances of the movie clip from the Library to the  stage. Since the animation inside the movie clip is 10 frames long, the movie clips that  show up on frame 7 will start before the first movie clips have finished.  222   17.  Make as many additional layers and staggered key frames containing your movie clip   as you think necessary.  18.  Add frames to your main timeline so that the movie clips have enough time to play   and so that the looping of the main timeline is not obvious. Select frame 80, for  instance, for each layer and hit F5 to extend the duration of the movie.  19.  Test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return , and then save the Flash file.  Chapter 8  There's more... As stated above, it is possible to not only put animations inside movie clips, but also other  symbol instances inside movie clips. This means you can put a movie clip that contains an  animation inside of another movie clip and then animate that.  Animating movie clips that contain movie clips  1.  Open the bonetool_done.fla file from the Chapter 9 folder. Also, leave your   current file open. You are going to copy and paste frames from one file into a movie  clip in the other. In the bonetool_done.fla file, use the Selection tool to select all of the parts of  the balloon man that you want to copy. Then go to Edit  Copy  Ctrl Cmd C . 3.  Go into the movie_clip.fla file you were working on earlier in this recipe.   2.   If you don't have a file, use a file of your choosing, or just create a new Flash file.  4.  At the bottom left of the Library panel, click on the New Symbol button:  223   Flash Animations  5.  Name the symbol mc_swimming. For Type, choose Movie Clip. Click OK. 6.  You should now be looking at a blank white stage with a plus sign in the middle of it.  The timeline should have just one layer with one empty key frame. Select the empty  key frame and go to Edit  Paste In Place so that all of the separate pieces of the  balloon man get lined up correctly. The animation of the armature is now inside your  movie clip symbol. Make sure that all of the layers show up for the same amount of  time. F5 will add frames to a layer.  7.  At the top left of the stage, click on Scene 1 to see the main timeline again. 8.  Click on the New layer button at the bottom left of the timeline to make a new layer.   Double-click to rename it swimming.  9.  Select the key frame for the swimming layer and drag mc_swimming onto the stage.   Place it outside of the stage area  the white area  at the bottom. You are going to  make the swimmer swim up.  10.  Right-click Ctrl-click on the key frame for the swimming layer and choose Create   Motion Tween. Create Classic Tween will also work just fine if you prefer it.  11.  Select frame 80  the last frame of the movie thus far  and hit F6 to make a new key  frame there. At that frame, select the symbol instance of mc_swimming and move it  off the top of the stage.  12. Test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return  to see the full effect. This is the same theory used   to create walk cycles. You just happened to create a swim cycle instead.  13.  Adjust the tween s  as much or as little as you like. 14.  Remember that movie clip symbols can hold any number of layers and animations.   They can also contain ActionScript and other symbols.  See also   f Creating classic tweens  f Creating motion tweens  Creating a button Buttons are useful user interface elements. Buttons are a form of a symbol. They allow the  user to trigger events as simple as a visual rollover, or as complex as controlling slideshows,  and more. In this lesson, you will learn how to set up a button so that it has up, over, down,  and hit states. Buttons can be made using text, vectors, and imported bitmap files.  224   How to do it...  Chapter 8  1.   In Flash, create a new file by going to File  New  Ctrl Cmd N . Select Flash File   ActionScript 3.0  and hit OK. 2.  Save the file as button.fla. 3.  Double-click on Layer 1 and rename it button. 4.  Grab the Type tool. Click on the stage and type Click here. 5.  Select the text with the Selection tool and go to Modify  Convert to Symbol. Name   it b_click, or whatever name seems appropriate. For Type, choose Button. Hit OK.  6.  Double-click on the symbol instance on the stage to isolate it and gain access to its   timeline. Zoom in as necessary.  7.  Once you double-click, the top left of the stage should show the breadcrumbs for your  location inside the movie, such as Scene 1 and then b_click  or whatever you named  your symbol instance . Make sure that the breadcrumbs list the name of your symbol  instance as the last  farthest right  of the breadcrumbs. If it's not the last one on the  right, click on it so that it becomes the last one on the right.  8.  There should just be four frames if the button was made correctly. The frames are    not time-based, but user-based. Therefore, they are named Up, Over, Down, and  Hit, instead of numbered. The text you converted into a symbol is written onto the  Up key frame.  9.  Select the key frame for Over by clicking on the frame below where it says Over on  the timeline. Hit F6 to make a copy of the previous key frame. Use the Properties  panel or the fill color chip in the Tool box to change the color of the text.  10.  Select the key frame for Down by clicking on the frame below where it says Down on   the timeline. Hit F6 to make a copy of the previous key frame. Use the Properties  panel or the fill color chip in the Tool box to change the color of the text.  11.  Select the key frame for Hit by clicking on the frame below where it says Hit on the  timeline. Hit F6 to make a copy of the previous key frame. Use the Rectangle tool to  create a rectangle that completely covers the text. Make sure that it has a fill color. It  does not matter what color you use. No one will see it but you.  The hit state is the active area of the button. Whatever exists in color on the  hit state is the part of the SWF file that is active as a button. Therefore, if you  have text only as your hit state, the user must hit the lines of the text in order  to activate the button. This is not user friendly. A rectangle that completely  covers the text is user friendly. The user needs to roll over or click on the nice,  big, easy-to-hit rectangle to activate the button.   225   Flash Animations  12. Test the movie  Ctrl Cmd Return . In the SWF file, roll your mouse over the button to  see the Over state. Click and hold your mouse button down on the button to see the  Down state. Move or keep your mouse away from the button to see the Up state. You  will not see the Hit state. The shape you made on the Hit state delineates the active  area of the button. Where ever that shape exists, the button states will function. It's  like an image map or hot spot.  13.  Save and close the file.  Button symbols can have any number of layers. They can also contain movie  clips and graphic symbols in addition to vectors, text, and imported bitmap  images. However, a button cannot contain another button.  226   A  WordPress Resources  Here is a collection of links that you may find useful as you continue learning about WordPress.   f http:  www.alistapart.com  Advanced web design resources: "For people who make websites."

As you know, this book focused on Adobe Flash CS4 and ActionScript 3.0 as they are  used and implemented in WordPress. Many of the resources listed below have information  or tutorials about other versions of Flash and ActionScript 2.0, in addition to further  CS4 resources that are not covered in the scope of this book. The list below is in no way  comprehensive. It merely offers suggestions.  My learning process came from a number of different sources, some of which are listed below.  Over the course of my years of teaching, I have also been a student. A fellow instructor, Abigail  Rudner  http:  www.rudner.com , was a great help to me when I first started learning  Flash and using ActionScript 2.0. Many books exist that are specific to Flash and ActionScript.  For books, I suggest hunkering down in a bookstore to look through the selection to find the  book s  that meet your needs for subject matter, proficiency level, and writing style.

It's worth learning the shortcuts for any program you  regularly use. In this section, you will find WordPress and Flash keyboard shortcuts. We also  point you to URLs to learn keyboard shortcuts for Windows, Macintosh, and Firefox.  WordPress has built in shortcuts for the Visual Editor, the HTML Editor, and for   Comment Moderation.  Please note that keyboard shortcuts work differently depending on your  operating system and browser. We suggest using Firefox for maximum  compatibility. Most  but not all  of the following shortcuts are available in  Internet Explorer. If you are using Firefox, use Alt + Shift + key. If you are using Internet Explorer, you may use Alt + key  Shift is never needed  when using the HTML Editor, but sometimes needed in the Visual Editor . If you are using a PC, use the Ctrl key. If you are using a Mac, use the Cmd  Apple  key instead of the Ctrl key.  WordPress Visual Editor keyboard shortcuts In the Visual Editor, you have two ways to style your content. The first way is to select a bit of  text and press the keyboard shortcut to style your selection. The other way is to start the tag  by doing the keystroke, then typing your content, then keystroke again to specify the end tag.   f Bold: Ctrl Cmd  b  f Italics: Ctrl Cmd  i   Shortcut Keys   f Underline: Ctrl Cmd  u  f Undo:  Ctrl Cmd  z  f Redo:  Ctrl Cmd  y  f Heading 1: Ctrl Cmd  1  f Heading 2: Ctrl Cmd  2  f Heading 3: Ctrl Cmd  3  f Line Break:  Shift  Enter  f Insert Image: Alt Option  Shift  m  f Insert a Link: Alt Option  Shift  a  f Insert the Read More tag: Alt Option  Shift  t  f Align Left: Alt Option  hift l  f Align Center: Alt Option  Shift c  f Align Right: Alt Option Shift r  f Blockquote: Alt Option  Shift q  f Strikethrough: Alt Option  Shift   d  f Unordered List  ul : Alt Option  Shift u  f Ordered List  ol : Alt Option  Shift o  f Publish the Post: Alt Option  Shift   p   f Bold: Alt Option Shift b  f Italics: Alt Option Shift i  f Code: Alt Option Shift c  f List Item  li : Alt Option Shift l  f Insert the Date and Time: Alt Option Shift s  f No Heading shortcuts  f No align left, right or center  234  WordPress HTML Editor keyboard shortcuts In the HTML Editor, you will typically use two keystrokes to apply formatting  to insert the  start and end tags .

Similar to any endeavor, your website plan provides a starting point  and needed structure. A plan establishes priorities and metrics, which are what will be  emphasized and how success will be measured.  Goals  SEO Plan  Functionality Aesthetics  Content  What are  your goals?  Keyword,  Competition,  Audience  What must  users be able  to do?  How should  the site  look?  Outline  your initial  content.  Pick a  Theme Free or  Premium?  Extend  WordPress Research  plug-ins and  third-party  solutions  Goals It may seem obvious, but take the time to write down your goals. Of course you want to be on  the first page of Google for your targeted keywords. That's why you'll be making an SEO plan.  What else? If you are launching a new site, how many visitors do you hope to attract within  the first six months and within the first year? If you are selling products or services, how many  sales per month do you need to make? If you are launching a personal site, how many articles  per week or month do you want to post? How many inbound links do you want to build in  the first year? Be specific since this will help keep you on track as you develop, launch, and  maintain your site.   Site Planning SEO Planning Since it is so easy to set up a WordPress site, knowing what distinguishes your site and what  it is about is important. The basics of an SEO plan include: a 100 character site description   for your description meta tag—this is the text that will summarize your site when it comes  up in search engines  and 15 keywords or phrases  for your keywords meta tag . This list of  keywords will keep you on target as you develop on site SEO. These are the words that should  be repeated throughout your site: as categories, in your title tags, alt tags, file names, and   most importantly  marked up as  ,  ,  , and  , etc.  Your domain name is important in so many ways. It should be succinct, easy to remember,  and not easily confused with another site. SEO is another consideration. Make sure that your  most important keywords are in your domain name, if at all possible.  A site with good SEO clearly explains what your site is about, to both people and search  engines. Don't forget to establish and research your targeted audience. Distinct user groups  have varying levels of technical ability and different expectations and aesthetics. Establishing  these parameters will help guide subsequent planning stages.  Look at your competition and establish your market niche. What is already being done? You  can distinguish your site by offering something unique, or an improvement on what's already  out there. What can you do better? This is your competitive advantage.  Do keyword research, using the Google AdWords keyword research tool, available here:  https:  adwords.google.com select KeywordToolExternal  Functional Requirements What must visitors be able to do while on your site? Here are a few common examples: users  should be able to comment, register, submit content, sign up for a newsletter, fill out a contact  form, subscribe to an RSS feed, or make a purchase.  Many actions can be done using WordPress alone. Others will require plug-ins or other   third-party solutions. You will need to research and evaluate how to accomplish each of   your requirements with WordPress or existing plug-ins. For special projects, consider working  with a WordPress consultant to custom code a solution for your specific needs.  Aesthetic Requirements How should the site look? Each site has unique requirements: an online scientific or literary  journal will have rather different constraints when compared to an e-commerce site or a   user community.  240   It's always a good idea to keep your essential content "above the fold," or viewable without any  vertical scrolling. Some sites keep all the content above the fold, though this is very different  than the traditional blog format that lists many posts  or excerpts  on the homepage.  Additionally, take time to address each of the following design elements:  Appendix D   f Colors: Pick out colors and get the hexadecimal values. For a chart of colors, see:   http:  www.morecrayons.com    f Image sourcing: Gather and prepare your images, resizing and saving your photos  in .jpg format. If you need images, see the following stock photography website:  http:  www.sxc.hu    f Fonts: What fonts will you use? Remember that users must have the font installed on   their computer. For this reason, a best practice is to specify font families via CSS—a  list of the fonts to be used, in the order specified, if available. Choose from the safe  web fonts  which exist on all computers , specify fonts for Mac, Windows 95 to XP,  or Vista. To use a non-standard web font, see Chapter 6: WP sIFR Plug-in. For help  picking out your fonts, see: http:  www.typetester.org    f Graphic assets: In order to customize your theme, you will need to organize and  prepare graphic assets such as a logo, header, backgrounds, buttons, ads, etc.   These should typically be in .gif or .png format. Consider working with a graphic  designer or a WordPress consultant, if necessary.   f Multimedia: Audio and video assets will almost always need to be resized,   compressed, or exported to be optimized for the Web. Gather your source files   and consider working with a Video editor, if needed.  Site Outline Make an outline of all the content on your site. This  includes your pages, categories, Tags and  initial posts to launch, as well as sidebar, header, and footer content. You may also consider  sketching out a content calendar which will include deadlines for adding new content after the  site is launched.  241   Index  ampersand  &   198 Apache web server  URL  16 B Bone tool  activating  44 installing  44 using  44 working  45, 46  button  about  219 using, steps  220, 221  Breadcrumb NavXT plugin  version 3.2.1   creating, steps  225, 226 editing  139 sound effects, adding  140 sound effects adding, steps  140-142 sound effects adding, working  142 using, in common library  137 using in common library, steps  137, 138 using in common library, working  139  button symbol  209 C category archive view  10 classic tween about  211 creating, steps  211, 212 working  212  colors  URL  241  Symbols .htaccess file  39 .swf  embedding, in WordPress  12 embedding in WordPress, steps  13, 14 embedding in WordPress, working  15 placing  10  µAudio plugin  version 0.6.2   activating  132, 133 configuring  132 downloading  132, 133 installing  132, 133 URL  132 using  132 A Abigail Rudner  URL  231  absolute dimensions  versus relative dimensions  20  Adobe Flash  resources  231 URLs  231  Adobe Media Encoder  about  107 edit export, settings  110, 111 encoding, steps  108, 109 encoding, working  109 files, removing  112 multiple files, encoding at once  112  AdWords Keyword Research Tool  A List Apart Magazine  URL  40  URL  227   common library  buttons, using  137 buttons using, steps  137, 138 buttons using, working  139  content  inputting, in HTML editor  35 inputting in HTML editor, steps  36 inputting, in Visual Editor  29 inputting in Visual Editor, steps  29 inputting in Visual Editor, working  30, 31  CSS  about  190 block elements  193, 194 comments  194 inline elements  193, 194 steps  190 working  191-193 CSS stylesheet  30 custom page template  creating  205-207 D Datafeedr Random Ads V2 plugin  version 2.0   about  184 activating  184 ads, adding to widgetized sidebar  185 Commission Junction, URL  184 downloading  184 flash animation adding, full embed code    used  185  homepage, URL  184 installing  184  Dean’s FCKEditor   31 Digital Restrictions Management.
